YANKEES' OWNER TELLS AGENT: SHOW ME THE OFFERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The agent for outfielder Bernie Williams says there
is a lively market for the services of his client, that he has
offers of seven and eight years in hand. George Steinbrenner, the
Yankees' principal owner, does not believe him.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees offered Williams a five-year, $60-million deal
within the last week, a package that the center fielder initially
rebuffed. On Thursday evening, Steinbrenner met with Scott Boras,
Williams' agent, for more than two hours in Cleveland. As he
recalled their conversation Friday, Steinbrenner said he asked
Boras to reveal the specifics of the offers and to tell him which
teams were interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a Boras basher, but I know his game,'' Steinbrenner
said. ``He says he has a lot of bids. But when I say, `What have
you got?' he can't answer me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner was asked if he believes Boras' silence is a result
of a devotion to confidentiality, or if he believes Boras does not
have the offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he can answer because he doesn't have the
offers,'' Steinbrenner said. ``I don't think he has anything really
concrete.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner said the meeting was cordial and friendly, a
meeting that could lead to further discussions before Thanksgiving.
In fact, Steinbrenner has the impression that Boras is ready to
negotiate with alacrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept on saying he had all these offers,'' Steinbrenner
said. ``I said: `Fine, what are they? What are they?' And that's
when that part of the conversation stops.''
</P>
<P>
   A baseball official said that Steinbrenner wanted Boras to tell
him what it would take to re-sign Williams, but that was not the
agent's style of negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   Although Boras has declined to identify the teams from which he
has received offers for Williams _ the player has paid a visit to
Arizona to talk to the Diamondbacks and is expected to go to Boston
to talk to the Red Sox _ Jim Bowden, general manager of the
Cincinnati Reds, confirmed Friday that he had offered Williams a
seven-year contract _ for $1 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is true,'' the creative Bowden said when asked about the
offer. And how did Boras react?
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott laughed and said, `You're unbelievable,''' Bowden said.
``I said we're just trying to be competitive. We want our fans to
know we're bidding for some of the best free agents at prices we
can afford, although we don't necessarily like to do it for that
many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden said he made a similar offer for another Boras client,
Kevin Brown, for six years. The Reds, of course, are no more likely
to sign Williams or Brown than they are Albert Belle or Brian
Jordan, two other good-hitting outfielders who are free agents.
</P>
<P>
   A major-league executive indicated that the Yankees have placed
an initial bid on Belle; Steinbrenner said he was aware of no such
offer. But Steinbrenner, who may be playing a negotiating game of
his own as he tries to clinch a deal with Williams, said he had
given General Manager Brian Cashman and Manager Joe Torre the
go-ahead to pursue the petulant All-Star if that was the route they
chose to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe really likes him,'' Steinbrenner said of Belle. ``He
really feels like he would fit in. You know, I really get ticked
off when I hear all this stuff about whether he might be a problem.
There was a lot of that kind of talk when we signed Reggie Jackson,
and Reggie came here and fit right in and helped us win a couple of
championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Arn Tellem, Belle's agent, said he did not expect any
developments during the weekend. ``I think we'll have a clearer
idea of what we're going to do next week,'' he said, adding that he
had continued to talk with the Yankees and the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Belle has until Dec. 2 to decide whether he wants to sign with
another team or remain with the White Sox.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Yankees and Darryl Strawberry have a new deadline for their
attempts to continue their relationship. They agreed to yet another
extension of the deadline, from midnight Friday to midnight next
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to work diligently to finalize an agreement which
will fit within the framework of the basic agreement,'' Cashman
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees want to sign Strawberry, who is undergoing treatment
for colon cancer, to a contract. Because they are not certain that
he will be able to play next season, they do not want his salary to
count against their 1999 payroll for luxury-tax purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman said he spoke Friday with Boras about Williams, Tellem
about Belle, Alan Nero about Randy Johnson and Tony Tanzer about
Steve Finley, a free-agent center fielder. He said he was having
serious conversations with all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jordan, who is being wooed by the Yankees, Mets,
Baltimore and Atlanta, said Friday that he hoped to decide which
team he will sign with by Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one team has an advantage right now,'' he said. ``I'm just
sitting back with my family trying to make the decision. I'm happy
to be in this situation now. You can tell the kids, hard work pays
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who was born and raised in Maryland, spoke at a news
conference at Camden Yards, where message boards flashed, ``Welcome
Home Brian Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   Another significant free agent, pitcher Todd Stottlemyre, has
apparently agreed to a $32-million, four-year contract with the
Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, 33, went 9-9 with a 3.51 ERA in 23 starts for St.
Louis before he was traded to Texas on July 31 along with infielder
Royce Clayton for pitcher Darren Oliver and third baseman Fernando
Tatis. He then went 5-4 with a 4.33 ERA in 10 starts for the
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   While Arizona made no announcement, the agreement was confirmed
Thursday by Jerry Colangelo, the Diamondbacks' chief executive
officer. ``We've agreed to agree,'' Colangelo said. ``We have the
formality of getting the contract completed.''

MEXICAN REBELS EMERGE, AND START COMPLAINING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico _ Top leaders of the
Zapatista rebels, wearing their trademark black ski masks, emerged
from their jungle hideouts to appear in public Friday for the first
time in two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatistas' reappearance in this colonial town in the
highlands of Chiapas state, which the rebels briefly occupied in
January 1994, had awakened hopes that they might consider renewing
peace talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
   But those were quickly dashed Friday night when the Indian
rebels angrily complained that a commission of federal lawmakers
charged with organizing the event had failed to provide beds and
food for them and treated them ``like animals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not asking for luxury hotels or grand banquets or bar
service,'' said a Zapatista commander who is known only by his
nom-de-guerre, Tacho, speaking to a room crowded with their
supporters. He said that many of the 29 Zapatista delegates to the
three-day meeting had no beds and were relegated to a building in
the rustic conference center here where the plumbing was broken.
</P>
<P>
   In icy tones, Tacho accused the lawmakers of being racist and
acting like Spanish conquistadores. The half-dozen legislators on
the commission come from all the parties in the Mexican Congress,
including both pro-government and pro-Zapatista groups. They serve
as mediators between the guerrillas and the government. None are
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatistas demanded an apology but did not threaten to walk
out of the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Talks with the government fell apart in late 1996, with the
Zapatistas charging that President Ernesto Zedillo had reneged on
accords reached earlier that year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to restarting contact with the mediating commission,
the Zapatistas also summoned 2,500 of their civilian supporters to
strategize about publicizing their message in other areas of Mexico
beyond Chiapas. Since a paramilitary band of government supporters
killed 45 Zapatista sympathizers in December 1997, Zapatista
leaders had severed contact with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   Their agreement to attend the brainstorming session this weekend
with dozens of pro-Zapatista political groups seemed to indicate
they felt they had become too isolated. However, Sub-Commander
Marcos, a non-Indian who is the rebels' chief strategist, did not
attend so far.

IS THIS CLAIBORNE'S LAST CHAPTER?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Chris Claiborne can't help himself, it just sort
of happens when he talks about college football. Ask him a
question, and you tend to get an answer in the past tense.
</P>
<P>
   When USC sealed up a bowl bid two weeks ago with a victory over
Stanford, it meant Claiborne would be making his first postseason
appearance since becoming a Trojan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just closes another chapter in my career,'' Claiborne said.
</P>
<P>
   Get the hint? It's become obvious that Claiborne will leave USC
after this season and make himself available for the NFL draft. All
that's left is the press conference, which should come sometime in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of finding reasons to turn pro, Claiborne is getting to
the point where he needs a reason, any reason, to remain at USC for
another season.
</P>
<P>
   This week's selling point involves UCLA. But Chris: You wouldn't
want to turn pro if you lost to UCLA today, would you? Wouldn't it
just make your college career seem unfulfilled without at least one
victory over your cross-town rival?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' Claiborne said. ``You have to take the wins with the
losses. And just have fun. The worst thing you can do is put one
team ahead of another. I'm looking forward to playing Notre Dame as
much.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, scratch that theory.
</P>
<P>
   Today's UCLA game is important to Claiborne. It's just not
getting in the way of his ultimate goal: the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   He's considered no worse than a top 10 pick, a 6-foot-3,
250-pound linebacker who won't need to come out on passing
situations. Someone who can play inside or outside.
</P>
<P>
   His future is something that weighs heavily on his mind. Not
just in five years, but 50 years from now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about the future a lot,'' Claiborne said. ``I want to
take care of my kids and my kids' kids. I want my grandkids to say,
`Yeah, we got old money.' It's up to me to establish that.''
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't be much of a problem. His national profile has
skyrocketed this season and will continue to rise since being named
one of three finalists for the Butkus Award.
</P>
<P>
   After USC played Florida State, Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden
said, ``(Ohio State linebacker) Andy Katzenmoyer is a great player,
but Chris Claiborne was even more impressive. We had a couple plays
we thought would break out big, but all you saw was No.55 swallow
somebody up.''
</P>
<P>
   There's little on an individual basis left for Claiborne to
accomplish, if he returns to USC for his senior year.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one thing missing, it's an elusive victory over the
Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an individual, I felt I played really good in those
games,'' Claiborne said. ``We just had some bad breaks and they
took advantage of it. Personally, it hasn't been painful. As an
individual, I felt I played really good.''
</P>
<P>
   His comments may sound slightly detached, but Claiborne has
always been more interested in expressing himself through his play
than with words.
</P>
<P>
   He'd rather try to sack Cade McNown than spend 10 minutes
explaining what it would feel like.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is real easy to get along with,'' said USC linebackers
coach Shawn Slocum. ``He interesting from that standpoint. He's not
real vocal. He just prepares himself and plays with intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne has changed this year, however. He is no longer just a
lead-by-example linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   When USC's offense sputtered in the first half against Oregon,
he went up to an offensive assistant and asked, ``OK, what are you
going to show us in the second half?''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, that might sound like player challenging a
coach, but those within the USC program understand his burning
desire to win, and expect those kind of remarks.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Claiborne has refrained from getting too emotional
talking about UCLA this week. He doesn't just want to beat the
Bruins, he wants to beat every team just as badly.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne's dominance this season was borne during a meeting
with Slocum shortly after he was hired in January.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne, unsure of the new coaching staff, considered
transferring to Colorado or Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first day here, we sat in my office and talked about his
thoughts of going elsewhere,'' Slocum said. ``He was upset with the
coaching change. It was a natural reaction. But once he realized
what would take place and that he was at the best possible place,
he got excited.''
</P>
<P>
   He has also developed a tight relationship with Slocum, who at
33, is young enough for Claiborne to relate to on a personal level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a fun year,'' Slocum said.
</P>
<P>
   But as Claiborne admits, it would be a lot nicer with a victory
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite a few times I've thought about last year's UCLA game,''
Claiborne said. ``It's going through my mind. I think this will be
a close game. We just can't feel like we're the underdog. If you
think that, why even come out?''

 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN and LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Deutsche Bank A.G., Germany's biggest bank, is on the
verge of signing an agreement to acquire Bankers Trust Corp., the
eighth-largest U.S. bank, for somewhere between $7.5 billion and $8
billion, executives involved in the talks said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Deutsche Bank deal for Bankers Trust, which could be
announced as early as next week, would be the biggest takeover of a
U.S. financial institution by a foreign bank.
</P>
<P>
   The $7.5 billion to $8 billion purchase price would represent
only a small premium to the total value of Bankers Trust's shares
in the stock market. As final details of the planned deal are
negotiated, the price could possibly go higher.
</P>
<P>
   In a year that has already witnessed a flurry of massive global
mergers, including German automobile giant Daimler-Benz's
acquisition of Chrysler Corp. and the merger of U.S. financial
services titans Citicorp and Travelers Group Inc., this deal is yet
another reminder of both the scale and the geographic reach of
these newly hatched transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations have shown an increasing willingness to merge
regardless of the nationalities of the partners involved as
executives around the world take advantage of a less restrictive
trading environment and a growing desire to tap into global
business expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, such large deals are never simple to carry out and the
complexity of managing tens of thousands of employees while making
sound business decisions is a challenge for even the most talented
business executives _ especially when the corporation created by a
megamerger spans the globe.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, Deutsche Bank, a commercial banking powerhouse
which has already had a difficult time with other recent forays
into the investment banking world, will face an enormous challenge
in making the acquisition of Bankers Trust a success.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust, having survived a series of financial scandals
that tarnished the vaunted trading house's reputation and hurt its
bottom line in recent years, has been refashioning itself as
investment banker to the nation's _ indeed, the world's _ smaller,
fast-growth companies. It has also carved out a niche underwriting
and trading high-yield debt, or so-called `junk bonds.'
</P>
<P>
   But Bankers Trust has lacked the heft needed to compete with
such vaunted Wall Street competitors as Morgan Stanley, Goldman
Sachs, and Merrill Lynch. Many analysts have believed for some time
that the bank face difficulty going it alone.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition is also certain to raise new speculation about
the future of J.P. Morgan and Co., the fourth largest bank in the
country. Like Bankers Trust, J.P. Morgan has worked hard to
transform itself from a commercial bank into an investment bank but
analysts are skeptical that J.P. Morgan has the ability to remain
competitive on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Deutsche Bank, which has openly been seeking an
acquisition in the United States in order to make a breakthrough
into investment banking, had unsuccessfully been courting J.P.
Morgan and was said to be considering Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
as another acquisition target.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Bankers Trust will certainly raise Deutsche
Bank's visibility on Wall Street, but it does not immediately grant
it a commanding presence in the investment banking market. Bankers
Trust is not a leader in overall stock and bond underwriting, nor
is it in the top ranks of providing advice on mergers and
acquisitions, both of which provide some of the most lucrative
profits on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows that banking consolidation is moving into a higher
level but there aren't that many deep-pocketed buyers out there,''
said Judah Kraushaar, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. ``The other
issue is how good a vehicle Bankers Trust will be for creating an
investment banking presence in the U.S. Anybody buying this
business is going to have to work very hard to make an adequate
return.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is likely that Deutsche will try to recruit a team of U.S.
executives who can bring added talent to Bankers Trust. Wall Street
executives have said that the German giant has made overtures to
James Dimon, the recently departed president of Citigroup, about
joining the company. Dimon has access to a well-regarded network of
dealmakers, some of whom still work for his old employer.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, the company formed by the merger of Citicorp and
Travelers, has been hurt by disorder in its investment banking
business. It could suffer from a further outflow of much-need
talent if Dimon took command at Bankers Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how Deutsche decides to manage Bankers Trust, the
future of its current chief executive, Frank Newman, appears to be
uncertain. Newman said in an interview earlier this year that his
bank was not for sale, but recent trading losses and weak support
from his board of directors may have contributed to his inability
to avoid a sale.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank could not be reached for comment and a Bankers
Trust spokesman declined to comment on the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are proponents of the idea that bigger is not necessarily
better,'' Newman in a recent interview. Newman became the bank's
chief executive nearly three years ago as the company began
recovering from its trading scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Newman, a former official of the U.S. Treasury Department, was
hired to bring regulatory credibility to Bankers Trust and to help
rein in its image as a home for free-wheeling traders who took
outsized risks. But Bankers Trust, which has $156.3 billion in
assets, suffered a $488 million loss in the third quarter due to
trading problems in Russia and in other financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   There may be other losses in store, making the purchase of
Bankers Trust risky. In its most recent filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, Bankers Trust acknowledged that its risk
management models essentially broke down during the unanticipated
financial upheavals of the third quarter. J.P. Morgan made a
similar disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust's shares have fallen precipitously recently,
although they rose sharply Friday, , climbing $5.25 or 7.3 percent
to $77.25, amid merger speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche, which has been trying to expand on its staid
foundation as a conservative and somewhat plodding financial
behemoth, recently said its profits for the quarter that ended on
Sept. 30 plunged 83.5 percent, to about $89 million, due to heavy
trading losses in emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Frankfurt-based bank already has been badly burned by an
expensive, but badly flawed, foray into investment banking through
the its Deutsche Morgan Grenfell unit. But Deutsche is still
determined to build a presence on Wall Street because it is worried
that it will be outmaneuvered on its home turf as European
financial markets, in part of monetary union there, shift to stocks
and away from the traditional bank lending that has been Deutsche's
mainstay.
</P>
<P>
   The exact terms of how Deutsche's acquisition of Bankers Trust
will be financed could not be determined, but the financing will be
arranged in Germany. Deutsche owns a large block of Daimler shares
but it is uncertain what the fate of that holding will be in light
of this deal.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs is representing Deutsche Bank in the talks; Morgan
Stanley is advising Bankers Trust.

EDITORIAL: KEEP THE 9TH CIRCUIT INTACT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 1st, 2nd grafs to change `PACIFIC NORTHWEST' to `NORTHWEST.'
No other changes.)  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Calif., Hawaii, Nev., Ore., Wash.)  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sat., Nov. 21:
</P>
<P>
   For years, conservatives have been trying to break up the Court
of Appeals for the 9th Circuit because they have been unhappy with
some of the court's rulings on environmental issues and death
penalty cases. Republicans in the Northwest have been particularly
vocal in clamoring for their own circuit, believing that the San
Francisco-based appeals court does not understand their values.
</P>
<P>
   A commission led by former Supreme Court Justice Byron White
will report on the issue to Congress next month. Its draft proposal
would significantly alter the court's structure without formally
cutting the circuit in two. The appellate judges would be assigned
to three regional divisions _ one for the Northwestern states, one
for northern California, Hawaii and Nevada, and one for southern
California and Arizona. These would function as semi-autonomous
units, but conflicting rulings would be resolved by a seven-judge
panel selected from the entire circuit. Administration would remain
under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is more reasonable than splitting the circuit. But it
is still a change for which a compelling case has not been made. A
simpler way to improve the court's performance is for Congress to
fill its vacancies. For most of the last four years, 10 out of 28
judgeships in the 9th Circuit have been vacant. Currently, only 22
are filled. In many cases judges from district courts or other
circuits are asked to sit on panels hearing oral arguments. Simply
reducing the excessive reliance on visiting judges could lead to
more consistent rulings.

McNOWN: FOUR STRAIGHT OVER RIVAL? 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rodney Peete will play today in the Rose Bowl. The
former USC quarterback will come dressed like Cade McNown, he will
look like Cade McNown, and he will sling the ball left-handed, just
like Cade McNown. But don't be fooled.
</P>
<P>
   When USC and UCLA collide for the 68th time today with a winning
streak, a losing streak and the Fiesta Bowl at stake, Peete's
legacy will live within the redheaded quarterback wearing No. 18 in
powder blue.
</P>
<P>
   Their personas and performances have merged in memory as the
years recede. One wore red, the other wears blue, but they are one
in the same. Just as Peete killed the Bruins in 1985, '87 and '88,
just as he overcame the measles, slayed Troy Aikman twice and kept
the Bruins from two Rose Bowls, so has McNown, a senior, killed the
Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   He will be the X factor today as he was in 1995, with an
improbable third-down run, and in 1996, with a fabulous fourth
quarter, and in 1997, with an impossible third-and-17 pass that set
up the winning touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   USC has not solved McNown just as UCLA _ with its future Hall of
Fame quarterback and NFL-heavy roster _ had no answer for Peete a
decade ago. As a freshman, Peete accounted for both of USC's
touchdowns in a 17-13 win. In his final two games, Peete completed
39 of 65 passes for 493 yards and three touchdowns. He beat the
Bruins not only with his arm, but with his head and his legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rodney was a major, major factor in their wins,'' longtime
UCLA assistant Bob Field said. ``I remember in 1987, we were ahead
10-0 and they were inside our 10 with about 10 seconds left in the
half.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw a pass that Eric Turner intercepted. (Turner) was
1-yard deep and just took off. Peete ran him down all the way at
the (11). Saved a touchdown. That was a huge play in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   X X X
</P>
<P>
   McNown was reared in Hollister, a few miles south of San Jose,
and spent his senior year in the Portland suburb of West Linn. He
had no UCLA or USC blood and no allegiance when he arrived in
Westwood in 1995. But it did not take long for him to learn the way
of the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the moment I showed up, people talked about USC,'' he
said. ``You get brainwashed. It's not an unhealthy thing. It's a
fun rivalry.... It's a healthy hate.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not grow up playing Pop Warner against future Trojans and
he did not attend high school with them. That detachment may be his
greatest asset: He brings fierce desire to the annual game, but it
does not consume him. He does not worry about going home for the
summer and catching hell from Trojans at the mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three kinds of players in this game,'' UCLA center
Shawn Stuart said. ``There are guys who get really nervous, guys
who stay calm and guys who play for fun. Cade's never nervous.
Everything about him is calm, and that's a big advantage when
there's so much riding on the outcome and so many expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   McNown's numbers against USC are not overwhelming: 59 percent
completions, 700 yards, four touchdowns, three interceptions. But
like Peete, his performance is defined by plays, not statistics,
and one of his most memorable came not on the field but on the
sideline _ in the third quarter of the 1995 game, after he had
thrown his second interception.
</P>
<P>
   As offensive coordinator Bob Toledo berated him, McNown spotted
then-coach Terry Donahue looming nearby. McNown, a freshman, became
convinced Donahue was going to yank him from the game. He charged
at Donahue and grabbed his coach by the head, each hand becoming a
clamp over Donahue's ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I CAN GET THIS DONE!'' McNown screamed.
</P>
<P>
   Donahue, stunned, had no intention of changing quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I CAN GET THIS DONE!'' McNown screamed again.
</P>
<P>
   His face was bright red, his grip unrelenting, his green eyes
wide and wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``I CAN GET THIS DONE!''
</P>
<P>
   McNown cooled down, stayed in the game and later made the play
that would define his career: two minutes left, UCLA clutching a
24-20 lead and facing third-and-13 from its own 29. A punt would
give USC good field position and plenty of time.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo called a quarterback keeper from the shotgun formation.
McNown grabbed the snap, then charged around right end. He cut
upfield, burst through All-American Willie McGinest's arm tackle as
if he'd done it all his life, and weaved his way for 21 yards.
</P>
<P>
   First down, UCLA. Game over.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Cade ran that quarterback keeper past McGinest,'' Donahue
said, ``I said to myself, `Goodness, gracious, that's big time.'''
</P>
<P>
   McNown was at his best in the watershed 1996 game, calmly
completing 16 of 25 passes for 259 yards in the second half and
leading the Bruins to 17 points in the final six minutes of
regulation. He threw for one touchdown and ran for two, but his
best play was a fourth-down pass to tight end Mike Grieb that kept
a last-minute touchdown drive alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Cade I'm proud of is every game you get a
great effort out of him,'' offensive coordinator Al Borges said.
``But the past three years, you've gotten his best effort in the
USC game.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, McNown burned USC with his legs in the first half and
his arm in the second. Tied 21-21 in the third quarter, McNown
glared at third-and-17 from the UCLA 18. He eluded a tackler, then
hit Danny Farmer for 36 yards. Later in the drive, he found Grieb
for a 38-yard touchdown that became the winning score.
</P>
<P>
   Three games, three plays and three victories.
</P>
<P>
   Today, McNown attempts to become the first quarterback in city
series history to win four.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it gets back to,'' Toledo said, ``is great players make
great plays in big games.''
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to com-Peete with that.

 (Subs 4th, 5th, 6th &AMP; 12th grafs to clarify &AMP;, in 4th graf, to add
Bibbs' age.)  
 (ATTN: Texas, Va., La.)  (bl) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Hampton, Va., and Lubbock, Texas, a calm has been shattered.
A women's college basketball game canceled. Two communities, one
largely black and one largely white, are left to wonder whether
games are all they have in common, whether this latest wound will
ever heal.
</P>
<P>
   The healing process began in earnest Friday when Lubbock Mayor
Windy Sitton flew to Virginia to apologize to Hampton University's
president, the head women's basketball coach and the team for
events that have Lubbock defending itself from being painted as an
intolerant city with a racist police force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so sorry,'' Sitton said.
</P>
<P>
   From Lubbock, Ken Walker, the 48-year-old chief of police, said:
``I hate that it happened. I wish it hadn't have happened. It did.
We can't go back and change it. Do we wish it hadn't happened?
Absolutely. Especially since the coaches didn't do anything. They
were at the wrong place at the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   For Patricia Bibbs, Hampton's second-year head coach, the wrong
place and time were Monday at a Wal-Mart in Lubbock, where her team
had traveled to play 12th-ranked Texas Tech. In a startling series
of events, the police arrested Bibbs, 48; her husband, Ezell Bibbs
Jr., 46, and an assistant coach, Vanetta Robinson Kelso, 36 _ all
of them black _ after a Lubbock woman reported that the women had
tried to engage her in a ``pigeon drop'' scam in the store's
parking lot. The three were handcuffed and taken to jail, and
Tuesday's game was canceled. But the three were cleared later after
the police reviewed security videotapes at the store.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mission today in coming here is to remove any suspicion,
any doubt about the guilt of the three and to do anything I
possibly could to preserve the dignity of Hampton University,''
Sitton said.
</P>
<P>
   Bibbs stood by, listened graciously to Sitton and accepted an
outpouring of support.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, she must have been wondering how would she get
back those intangibles that had been snatched away by police last
Monday in Lubbock. In 15 years as a highly respected head coach _
13 at Grambling, 2 at Hampton _ she has always been known for
professionalism, in spite of violations at Grambling that led the
women's program to be placed on two years of probation in 1997. .
</P>
<P>
   Now Bibbs, her husband and an assistant coach find themselves
reconciling anger, hurt and feelings of revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton's president, Dr. William Harvey, said at a news
conference Friday: ``The apology is all well and good, and I
believe that she is sincere, but you can't undo what's been done.
No one should have to endure that kind of humiliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by telephone after practice Friday, an emotional
Bibbses told of the humiliation of being handcuffed and placed in
the back of a squad car.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I could think of was having my team see me like this,''
she said. ``I saw one of my assistant coaches come out to the
parking lot. I just yelled at him: `Please don't let them see me
like this. Keep them away.'
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I get that back? How can I get that back?''
</P>
<P>
   The police said that the arrests were a case of mistaken
identity. But legal action is very likely _ by Hampton. Officials
at the university _ one of the most prestigious of the nation's
traditionally black schools _ hired the lawyer Johnnie Cochran to
investigate the arrests.
</P>
<P>
   In Lubbock, police and politicians insisted that race was not a
factor in the arrests. Bibbs, who was born in Choudrant, La., and
raised in Monroe, sees a different story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, I'm a professional person, my husband's a professional
person,'' she said. ``You tell someone that you are here to play
Texas Tech, and they don't want to listen to that. They didn't want
to to listen, and they didn't listen. I kept telling them: `I'm a
friend of Marsha Sharp. We're playing her team, you can check it
out.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sharp, Texas Tech's head coach since 1981 and a longtime friend
of Bibbs, called the arrest bizarre and said she was devastated by
the events. But asked whether she thought the arrests were racially
motivated, Sharp said: ``My gut feeling is that that's not what
we're dealing with here. I went to her hotel and talked to Coach
Bibbs and the players. I just told them how sorry I was this
happened and that we would do anything we could to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibbs was selected the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference coach of
the year last season, and her team was the MEAC co-champion. She
arrived from Grambling State, where the women's basketball program
was placed on two years of probation by the National Collegiate
Athletic Association in 1997 for violations committed under Bibbs.
This season Bibbs packed her early schedule with powerhouse teams,
not simply for the lucrative financial guarantees that smaller
programs receive to play larger programs in their home arenas, but
to get battle tested for the coming season.
</P>
<P>
   The events of the last week have thrown the season into free
fall. Even during Friday's news conference with the mayor of
Lubbock, Bibbs kept flashing back to the parking lot. Watching the
police going through the van. Watching her assistant coach, Kelso,
who is five months pregnant, vomiting in the squad car after her
arrest. Going to the jail and sitting in a dingy cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so scared,'' she said. ``I've only seen this stuff on
television, and I've read about it, but it's scary. You don't know
what they're going to do, and we didn't see any black police
officers the whole time we were there.''
</P>
<P>
   Through tears, Bibbs said the mayor's apology may have removed
the nail, but the hole is still there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in education for 26 years,'' she said. ``I deal with
young ladies. Everybody who knows me knows that I'm a professional
person. I'm a lady. I carry myself like that, I acknowledge that
all the time. I have one of the best-dressed teams. Look what
they've done to me. How can you get that back? I've got to go into
these homes, recruiting these athletes, talk to their mothers. How
can I get that back?''

GIULIANI SEES A LESSON IN BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mass., N.Y.)  (js) 
 By BRUCE LAMBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani warned Friday that the likely
loss of the New England Patriots by Massachusetts should stand as
an object lesson for New York City in its dealings with the Yankees
and the Mets over proposals for new stadiums in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a look at what happened in Boston,'' the mayor said,
expounding on the issue during his weekly radio program on WABC-AM
and again during a news conference at City Hall. ``That could
happen here. Not only could it happen here, it has happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to efforts to keep the Yankees in the Bronx, Giuliani
said that ``the silly political pandering that's been going on by
the politicians in this city'' could force the teams out of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to lose the teams the way Boston and
Massachusetts have now lost the original Boston Patriots, now the
New England Patriots _ the way my predecessors lost the Brooklyn
Dodgers, for which this city should be ashamed, and the way they
lost the football Giants and the Jets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn Dodgers baseball team moved to Los Angeles in 1958
and the Giants and the Jets of the National Football League now
share a stadium in the Meadowlands of New Jersey, although both
clubs still call themselves New York teams.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said a similar fate could easily befall the city over
the Yankees or Mets. ``It happens because politicians are unwilling
to stand up to people that are just knee-jerking about this,'' he
said. ``They're unwilling to, like, take a look at the future and
say, yes, it's worth spending some public money if we can keep this
economic engine in our city. If you don't do that, somebody else
takes them away from you. That's what happened in Boston. And now
you have precisely the day-after reaction, all the people that
were, like, criticizing all of these politicians for the
possibility of using public money, they're going to come down on
them, big time.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said that Massachusetts lost the Patriots because the
speaker of its House of Representatives ``decided to call the owner
of the team a whiny billionaire'' and refused to spend money for a
new stadium, and because in Boston ``the Mayor had a deal with a
community group that didn't want the Patriots in their little
community in Boston, so he wasn't willing to deal with that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't care about the teams, fine, let them go,''
Giuliani said. ``Now that's a choice you can make. It's one that I
think would be a terrible mistake for New York. So I wish people
would look at the Boston thing and maybe step back and reflect on
this.''

NORTHRIDGE WELL AWARE OF ITS MISSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   POCATELLO, Idaho _ Stature in the Big Sky usually means wins
against Montana and Montana State. Not Idaho State, a dormant
program lost in the valleys and vastness of the already frozen
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, this is the most important moment in the history of Cal
State Northridge football.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's contest isn't only a game. It represents the vision
CSUN administrators possessed when they opted not to disband the
football program four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is the dream of first-year coach Ron Ponciano. He promised
CSUN's program would turn around quickly, but no one anticipated it
could be at this mind-boggling speed.
</P>
<P>
   There have been benchmark wins for the Matadors already and
larger victories are sure to come.
</P>
<P>
   However, none could shape the perception of CSUN's football
program like this game can. If the 23rd-ranked Matadors beat the
worst the Big Sky Conference offers, they will grab a share of the
league title for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   But the big stuff follows. A victory should also mean the first
playoff berth in the 37-year history of the program, whether it's
an automatic bid or an at-large berth into the 16-team Division
I-AA field.
</P>
<P>
   None of which seemed remotely possible a month ago when CSUN
dropped its second straight game and fell out of first place. It is
a season that has caught everyone, including the players, by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to be at home, or be at practice, and not think,
`Man, after this game we could be Big Sky champs and host a playoff
game,''' CSUN junior cornerback Chazz Moore said. ``I think
everyone fantasized about it, but I think everyone here knows what
we have to do, and that's not to underestimate Idaho State.''
</P>
<P>
   If No. 17 Montana defeats No. 20 Montana State this afternoon, a
Matadors win would secure an automatic playoff bid. If Montana
State wins, it would grab the conference's automatic berth and CSUN
would be forced to wait for Sunday's field to be announced to learn
its fate. All three teams are 7-3 overall, 5-2 in the Big Sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been reassured by people that if we win, regardless of
what else happens, we're going to be in,'' Ponciano said. ``We're
approaching this game as a playoff game because we know as soon as
we lose, it's over. It's win or stay home.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano's certainty stems from two factors.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Big Sky, which has a strong reputation, usually sends
two teams to the postseason. Since 1986, the first year the field
expanded to its current size, at least two Big Sky teams have
participated.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the Matadors are 15th among Division I-AA schools in the
Sagarin ratings. And the NCAA relies heavily on those rankings.
</P>
<P>
   The task seems simple enough, but Idaho State (2-8, 1-6) is so
bad it's making the Matadors a bit uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   Idaho State is averaging 18.9 points per game, a paltry number
in the offense-oriented Big Sky. However, the more demeaning marker
is the 38.6 points per game the Bengals yield. Their defense is
ranked in the bottom 10 percent in every major statistical category
in Division I-AA.
</P>
<P>
   Just thinking about Idaho State's defense is enough to make CSUN
quarterback Marcus Brady flash a smile, which is no easy feat. But
a bugaboo exists. ``Since they're last in the conference, if we
win, people will be like, `They were supposed to win,' '' said
Brady, coming off a 466-yard, four-touchdown performance. ``If we
lose, they'll be like, `Oh, I can't believe they lost to them.' We
can't drop off and lose this game or they'll notice we can't finish
the season, or what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   And forevermore, the debacle at Pocatello will fall into
Matadors lore.

KINGS TO USE WEEK OFF TO REGROUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Little by little, the pieces of the Los Angeles
Kings' broken puzzle are coming back together, and not a moment too
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Goaltender Jamie Storr, who hasn't played since suffering a
groin strain on Oct. 18, is expected to start in goal tonight when
the Kings play host to the Chicago Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   After tonight, the Kings (5-12-3) don't play again for a week,
but when they do step on the ice again they may be a vastly
different team, which can't be a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Doug Bodger may be back from his broken hand in a
week. Goalie Stephane Fiset should be ready to play after missing
six weeks with two groin strains. And No. 1 center Jozef Stumpel is
expected back from his latest sprained right ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Storr's return aside, though, the Kings will have to make do
with what they've got for one more game. The good news for the
Kings is that they'll be facing an opponent struggling just as
badly as they are.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have lost six games in a row and are 1-9-1 in their
past 11. The Blackhawks won their last game, at Nashville, but were
0-8-2 before that.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Storr, the Kings also should have 24-year-old
center Brandon Convery in the lineup tonight. He is expected to
play on one of the top two lines. The Kings claimed Convery on
Thursday after he was waived by the Vancouver Canucks.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Legace is scheduled to be Storr's backup, and Ryan Bach
has been assigned to the Long Beach Ice Dogs of the IHL.
</P>
<P>
   Possible suspension: One player the Kings probably won't have
for a while is enforcer Matt Johnson, whose blind-side hit knocked
Jeff Beukeboom semiconscious late in Thursday night's 5-1 loss to
the New York Rangers. Johnson and general manager Dave Taylor will
attend a hearing Monday in New York with NHL vice president Colin
Campbell, at which point Johnson is expected to be hit with a
suspension. He is not available to play tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Itinerary: Following tonight's game, the Kings are slated to be
off Sunday and Tuesday, but will practice the other four days
leading up to next Saturday night's game against the Phoenix
Coyotes at the Forum.

KENNEDY KEEPS ON PLUGGING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ When he signed his three-year contract
extension in June, Cortez Kennedy talked about the Seahawks finally
having the talent to be the top team in the AFC.
</P>
<P>
   During training camp in August, the Pro Bowl defensive tackle
talked about the Seahawks finally getting to the playoffs for the
first time in his nine-year career.
</P>
<P>
   As the man they call Tez sat in front of his locker this week,
all he could do was shake his head. And that said it all. Another
year. Another wasted opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks have lost five of their past seven games to slip to
the outer fringe of the playoff picture. Another loss in Dallas
Sunday against the Cowboys and this season will just about be
repeated history, even with five games left to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rocky right now,'' Kennedy said. ``It's just been a rocky
road.''
</P>
<P>
   As with most of the defensive players, it is difficult to lay
the blame on Kennedy. While his statistics are not impressive (25
tackles and one sack), his effort has been.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, Cortez is playing as well as he has since we've
been here,'' said Greg McMackin, the Seahawks' fourth-year
defensive coordinator. ``He has really shown up in the last four or
five ball games.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as Raiders Pro Bowl guard Steve Wisniewski put it after last
week's game, ``Cortez is still Cortez, and that's still pretty damn
good.''
</P>
<P>
   A better indication of Kennedy's contributions to the Seahawks'
big-play defense can be found in the numbers being compiled by
linebackers Chad Brown, Darrin Smith and Dean Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has 7{ sacks among his team-leading 96 tackles and remains
on pace to challenge the club record of 153 tackles by Terry Beeson
in 1978. Smith has 53 tackles, five sacks and has returned two
interceptions for TDs, despite missing 2{ games because of
injuries. Wells is coming off a career-best game against the
Raiders in which he intercepted a pass, forced a fumble and had
seven solo tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those plays started with Kennedy's disruptive push tying
up two blockers to alter what the offense was intending to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cortez is keeping people off of people, and other guys are
benefiting because of his play,'' McMackin said.
</P>
<P>
   Nice words. So why does Kennedy feel so numbingly normal?
Because the norm for him has been playing very well on teams that
don't. Since making Kennedy their first-round draft choice in 1990,
the Seahawks are 58-80. He was named NFL defensive player of the
year in 1992 and Kennedy's string of six straight Pro Bowls ended
last year when he missed the first eight starts of his career with
ankle and knee injuries. But his teams have never been to the
playoffs and have posted only one winning season (9-7 in his rookie
year).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to count us out yet,'' Kennedy said of the
postseason. ``We still can get there. It's not going to be easy,
but I can't give up. I still have to believe we can do this. I want
it too badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse for Kennedy has been the gradual disbanding
of the Rookie Club, the other members of the '90 draft _ linebacker
Terry Wooden, strong safety Robert Blackmon and running back Chris
Warren.
</P>
<P>
   Wooden and Blackmon left in free agency last year, Warren this
year. Wooden is now starting for the 7-3 Raiders. Warren is a
valuable role player for the 7-3 Cowboys. Blackmon is playing for
the Colts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to see them doing well, but I miss those guys,''
said Kennedy, who still talks with Warren and Wooden once a week
and Blackmon every other week. ``They weren't only my teammates,
they were my best friends.''
</P>
<P>
   And right now, Wooden and Warren are a lot closer to obtaining
that ultimate goal of reaching the playoffs than Kennedy.

STARS MAKE RIGHT MOVES IN VICTORY
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The two major changes Stars coach Ken Hitchcock made to
his lineup Friday night ended up being the two players who most
affected the game.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Sergey Gusev scored his first NHL points, registering
a goal and an assist, in his first game of the season. And
defenseman Darryl Sydor had a goal and assist while playing forward
full time for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   That combination helped the Stars to a 4-2 win over the New York
Islanders and kept the Stars atop the Western Conference with a
10-3-2 record. It was the third consecutive victory for the Stars
and also improved their NHL-best home record to 7-1-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good hockey game for us the first game back \Rafter a
five-day layoff\S,'' Hitchcock said. ``It was a good balanced
effort from everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to two points apiece from Gusev and Sydor, there
were more good signs: Brett Hull added two pretty assists to push
his team-leading point total to 15; Pat Verbeek broke a seven-game
goal drought; the Stars' power play went 2-for-6 and the defensive
pair of Derian Hatcher and Richard Matvichuk combined for 13 hits
and six blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   Gusev, however, was clearly a standout. After scoring seven
points during the preseason, the 22-year-old rookie has been forced
to sit through 14 games, waiting for a chance to play. He was
shuffled into the lineup last night because Jere Lehtinen is out
with a broken thumb. Hitchcock moved Sydor from defense to the left
wing on a line with Mike Modano and Hull and inserted Gusev as
Sergei Zubov's defensive partner.
</P>
<P>
   Gusev said he has been waiting for a chance to impress someone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of hard,'' Gusev said. ``I really wanted to play
great today and try to have my best game.''
</P>
<P>
   Gusev, who was playing his 10th NHL game after getting into nine
games last season, said he wasn't nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zubie helped me a lot with that,'' Gusev said.

UNLIKELY QUARTERBACKS' TALES UNFOLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two quarterbacks playing in games today on opposite ends of the
country could have a major impact on this year's national
championship race. And neither player expected to be in that
position.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State sophomore Marcus Outzen will lead the Seminoles'
offense against in-state rival Florida. Southern California
freshman Carson Palmer will be running the Trojans' offense when
they play cross-town rival UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure? Nah.
</P>
<P>
   ``If \RFlorida thinks\S they're just going to show up and be
able to win the game, that's not going to happen,'' Outzen said.
``Actually, I hope they do think that. We've got all the tools. The
only thing different is me, and I feel I can get the ball to the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Outzen, who is nicknamed Rooster, made his first start last week
against Wake Forest. It was a victory, but unimpressive. Outzen was
11-of-19 for 184 yards as the Seminoles had a season-low 347 yards
of total offense.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State has won 10 of 11 games thanks to a big-play
offense that has produced 35 plays of 25 or more yards. Coach Bobby
Bowden was downbeat this week. Before Outzen replaced the injured
Chris Weinke, Florida State's offense was starting to become
dominant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked so futile on offense,'' Bowden said. ``With the
biggest game of the year coming up, we really have got to go back
to square one offensively and get some things done.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the Florida-Florida State game is still in the
running for the national championship. While USC is headed to a
bowl game, its main focus will be ruining the Bruins' national
championship hopes. To do that, the Trojans will need a solid game
from their 18-year-old quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago at this time, Palmer was leading Santa Margarita High
School to the Southern Section (Calif.) Division V football
championship game. He is approaching today's game with Gen-X
indifference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been getting nervous at all lately,'' said Palmer,
who has won both his games as a starter. ``You can't approach it
any differently, whether you're playing the worst team in the
league or the best team in the nation. You have to focus the same
way, look at the game the same way, practice the same way and play
the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett has been impressed with Palmer's mature
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is he has a calmness,'' Hackett said.
``He is a very composed, very poised 18-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are valuable attributes when faced with playing the
high-profile position in a big game.  &LR; tagtop:Wendell Barnhouse,
(817) 390-7238
Bowl talk The Aloha would like to match Colorado as an at-large
team against a Pacific-10 Conference team, perhaps USC. Aloha
officials want to make that deal soon. Colorado wants to wait until
after next Saturday's game against Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   The Gator would like a Georgia Tech-Notre Dame contest (The Gold
Helmet Bowl?). For that to happen, Georgia Tech must beat Wake
Forest to tie for first place in the Atlantic Coast Conference and
Notre Dame must lose either to LSU today or to USC next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Tulane, if it finishes 11-0, could wind up with an at-large
berth in the Bowl Championship Series. The Orange Bowl would love a
Tulane-Florida State game (Bobby Bowden vs. his son Tommy, the
Green Wave coach).
</P>
<P>
   The Western Athletic Conference champion, currently homeless,
could find a bowl haven in the Liberty. If that happens, Wyoming
could wind up in the Las Vegas Bowl and BYU could play in the Oahu
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Ten is guaranteed six bowl slots. Five teams have
qualified for the postseason. The only other team with a chance to
do so is Michigan State, which must beat Illinois and Penn State to
become eligible for a bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In the Pacific-10 Conference, California, Washington and Arizona
State all are 5-5 and need to win their final game to become bowl
eligible. If UCLA winds up in the Fiesta Bowl, Arizona will hope
for a Rose Bowl bid. The Sun Bowl is leaning toward Oregon, the
Oahu Bowl would like Washington and the Las Vegas would like Cal.
</P>
<P>
   The Micron PC Bowl, formerly the Carquest, is interested in
Central Florida. The Micron PC has tie-ins with the ACC and the Big
Ten. If the Big Ten doesn't have enough bowl-eligible teams, the
bowl could invite Central Florida.
Fry plays it coy The coaching carousel has started spinning. There
are openings at Auburn, Nevada-Las Vegas, Southwestern Louisiana
and Clemson. And there will be more.
</P>
<P>
   There continues to be speculation that one of those coaching
openings will be at Iowa. The Hawkeyes are 3-7 and since the team's
last Rose Bowl trip in 1990, Iowa is 53-38-2.
</P>
<P>
   But Hayden Fry, the man who led the renaissance of the Iowa
program, is noncommittal about his plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a real long year,'' said Fry, who turns 70 in
February. ``I would imagine that somewhere down along the way I'll
have to make a decision. I've said I'd like to coach until I'm 70,
but \RPenn State's Joe\S Paterno and LaVell Edwards \Rof Brigham
Young\S are going to outlive me.''
Davie looks ahead Notre Dame is 8-1 with games against LSU (today
in South Bend) and at Southern California next Saturday. If Notre
Dame goes 10-1, it likely will wind up with a berth in the Bowl
Championship Series and $12 million payday.
</P>
<P>
   However, second-year coach Bob Davie is not declaring his
program ready for prime time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a long way to go before we start talking about
preseason rankings and the national championship hunt,'' he said.
``I see this program _ and I may upset some people _ I see it two
years down the road, three years down the road, before this program
is built back up with a strong foundation. We're still a building
program.''
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame should return 31 of its top 44 players next season,
including quarterback Jarious Jackson. If the Irish finish 10-1
this season, they're likely to be a top-five team next season.
Briefly Arkansas defensive coordinator Keith Burns on Tennessee
running back Travis Henry: ``I don't know what he weighs. But if
he's 220, 200 of it's from the waist down.''
</P>
<P>
   Interceptions were in the air last week in the Atlantic Coast
Conference. Duke quarterback Bobby Campbell set an ACC record by
throwing seven interceptions against Maryland. Florida State
cornerback Mario Edwards set a league record with four
interceptions against Wake Forest.
</P>
<P>
   The seat occupied by Kim Helton is pretty toasty. The University
of Houston football coach is 17-48-1 in six seasons. Helton has
three years remaining on a contract worth $900,000. The school
probably doesn't have the money to buy out the contract. Athletic
director Chet Gladchuck said there is a ``high level of
disappointment and anxiety'' about the football program.
</P>
<P>
   After Indiana plays Purdue today, Hoosiers quarterback Antwaan
Randle El will depart Sunday for Maui. Vacation? Hardly. He'll be
on his way to join Indiana's basketball team in the Maui Classic.
Randle El won't be playing, but he wants to join the team so he can
speed his transition from football to hoops.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State linebacker Jerry Rudzinski on the annual meeting with
rival Michigan: ``Someone asked me a couple of weeks ago, `Do you
think about Michigan all season?' I told him, `No, I think about
Michigan 365 days a year. I've been thinking about Ohio
State-Michigan since grade school.' ''
Bowl projections The likely matchups for the Bowl Championship
Series and the Cotton Bowl. The top two teams in the BCS rankings
will play in the national championship game in the Fiesta Bowl. The
other BCS bowls will be the Rose, Sugar and Orange. Champions of
the Big 12, Big Ten, Big East, Atlantic Coast, Southeastern and
Pacific-10 conferences are assured berths in BCS bowls. Two other
at-large teams will be selected. Fiesta, Jan. 4 Tennessee vs.
Kansas State Sugar, Jan. 1 Florida State vs. Notre Dame Rose, Jan.
1 UCLA vs. Michigan Orange, Jan. 1 Florida vs. Syracuse Cotton,
Jan. 1) Nebraska vs. Arkansas

OILERS BEAT DUCKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ For five years the Edmonton Oilers provided
the Anaheim Mighty Ducks with an easy target. The Ducks beat the
Oilers 16 times in 26 games, including three overtime victories.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, however, the Oilers got some payback as Andrei
Kovalenko scored 39 seconds into overtime to beat Anaheim 3-2
before 16,367 at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   The victory snapped the Ducks' three-game winning streak and
overshadowed a brilliant effort from Paul Kariya, who scored his
10th goal of the season and set up Antti Aalto's first NHL goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks had rallied twice to tie, but Kovalenko caught two
Ducks in the corner, cut to the net and easily beat Guy Hebert.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya had tied the game and moved into second in the NHL
scoring race with 24 points when he took a centering pass from
Marty McInnis in the slot and ripped a shot past Mikhail Shtalenkov
with 6:11 left in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever momentum the Ducks had going into the dressing room
after tying the game late in the first period didn't last long.
They took three consecutive penalties and the Oilers took a 2-1
lead early in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Haller was already in the penalty box for closing his hand
on the puck when McInnis pulled down Roman Hamrlik in the Edmonton
zone. The Ducks killed off 77 seconds of the two-man advantage, but
with one second left Kovalenko deflected Hamrlik's point shot past
Hebert at 5:48.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim then was forced to kill off the final 43 seconds of
McInnis' penalty and two more minutes when Haller was called for
high-sticking.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the period, Jason Marshall gave the Oilers yet another
chance when he cross-checked Kovalenko, but Edmonton was unable to
take advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The penalties left the Ducks little time to generate shots, let
alone good scoring chances against Shtalenkov. Anaheim managed only
one shot in the first 10 minutes and its only decent scoring chance
came in the final minute on a backhander by Kariya.
</P>
<P>
   With Oilers ahead 1-0 on the strength of Pat Fallon's goal at
3:37 of the first period, the unlikely combination of Kariya, Johan
Davidsson and Antti Aalto got the Ducks even at 14:07.
</P>
<P>
   After the Oilers had bottled up the Anaheim power play unit for
almost the entire two minutes, Davidsson chipped the puck along the
boards to Kariya.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks captain turned on the speed, raced up the left side
and lifted a perfect pass over the stick of defenseman Frank Musil.
Aalto simply tipped it home for his first NHL goal.
</P>
<P>
   While the goal was historic for the 23-year old Aalto, Kariya,
at the ripe old age of 24 and playing in just his 238th NHL game,
notched his 300th career point with the assist.
</P>
<P>
   The power play goal was the Ducks' 10th in the last nine games,
after scoring only four in the first nine.

SANDERS' STATUS STILL UP IN THE AIR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ When Deion Sanders was tackled on the 1-yard
line after picking off a Jake Plummer pass last week, not only did
Sanders fall one yard short of scoring, he was inches short of
tying an NFL record.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders has eight interception returns for touchdowns. The
record is nine, set by Kenny Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders was hobbled by a sprained left big toe. He missed
practice again yesterday, but has said he expects to play this week
against Seattle. Coach Chan Gailey said he won't know about
Sanders' status for the game until right before Sunday's noon
kickoff against the Seattle Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Said Sanders about falling just short in Arizona: ``I knew it
was something wrong with me when I couldn't take that one to the
house.'' Injury update Center Clay Shiver practiced yesterday for
the first time since spraining his big toe two weeks ago against
the Giants. But reserve Mike Kiselak will make his second
consecutive start on Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks, Gailey
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike's going to start _ he's taken all the reps in practice
this week,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Everett McIver also practiced again yesterday without pain in
his knee, and all indications are that he will start in place of
rookie Flozell Adams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to be back in there,'' McIver said. ``Now I've got
to get behind the wheel and play. Football is football. I'm not
going to do anything differently than what I was doing before I got
hurt.'' Tough test Cowboys left tackle Larry Allen has not allowed
a sack this year. Tomorrow, he'll be matched primarily against
Seahawks right defensive end Phillip Daniels, who has four sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Allen has already nullified Arizona's Simeon Rice,
Philadelphia's Hugh Douglas, and Carolina's Sean Gilbert in a
manner that amazes quarterback Troy Aikman, who doesn't get to
really appreciate Allen's talent until he watches the game film the
day after games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He dominates his position more so than any other player at
their position,'' Aikman said. ``In this league, you just don't see
people taken off the \Rvideo\S screen. If you get a guy moving back
a bit, then you've done your job as an offensive lineman. But when
you get a guy who's not even showing up on the video screen, that's
unthinkable.'' Welcome back Jimmy The league has released its
formula for scheduling games next year. The Cowboys play the AFC
East, and have home games against the Jets and Dolphins, which will
mark Jimmy Johnson's return to Texas Stadium as a coach. The
Cowboys travel to Indianapolis and New England.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cowboys go on to win the division this season, they would
host the NFC West division winner, and the NFC Central second-place
finisher. They would travel to play the NFC Central champion, and
the NFC West third place finisher.
</P>
<P>
   If the season ended today, they would host Atlanta and Green
Bay, and travel to Minnesota and New Orleans.

FRANCHIONE'S BLUEPRINT HAS TURNED FROGS AROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twelve months ago, as the ultra-top-secret,
undercover-covert-if-we-tell-you-we'll-have-to-kill-you search for
a new TCU football coach was taking place, the future was dark.
</P>
<P>
   Darker than dark, actually.
</P>
<P>
   When you're 1-and-10, and half your league has just deserted
you, and you don't know if the next big Division I shuffle will
find you playing Northwestern or Nicholls State, that's dark.
</P>
<P>
   We can now say with reasonable affirmation, however, that rumors
of TCU's football demise were only that _ just rumors. The football
Frogs will go for a winning record today in Las Vegas. And if that
isn't one of the most stupefying sports stories of 1998, you
haven't been paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids have been amazing,'' head coach Dennis Franchione
said, before his team flew off to end its season against UNLV. ``My
coaching staff and the players have done a wonderful job.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've stayed together. They've looked forward. They have
remained positive. And they never really quit believing that they
were going to accomplish some things.''
</P>
<P>
   Astoundingly, but for the spank of an errant bounce or a
final-quarter breakdown, TCU would go into today's game nursing
bowl hopes. You can add it up.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the Frogs' five losses were by the margin of a touchdown
or less. They could well be 8-2 ... or 2-8.
</P>
<P>
   If the season has taught TCU fans anything, it is that coaching
does make all the difference in the world. Franchione's credentials
were auspicious, but he proved to be even better than advertised.
</P>
<P>
   His players seem to respect him. They play hard for him. TCU
football is family again, even as so many old faces depart the
athletic department.
</P>
<P>
   The intriguing thing is that Franchione has poured a new
foundation even without a solid quarterback. Patrick Batteaux,
converted from receiver, has had his moments, but failed to be the
all-around threat that the coaches hoped he would be.
</P>
<P>
   The turnovers that Batteaux avoided in the first half of the
season have lately shadowed him, prompting him to lose confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The end result is that Batteaux could well end up back at wide
receiver next season _ he caught 27 passes in 1997 _ and the
starting quarterback job could be up for grabs among transfer Matt
Schobel, redshirt freshman Sean Stilley of Lake Highlands and
highly touted likely-incoming freshman Casey Printers of DeSoto.
</P>
<P>
   Printers is so good, his weekly journal has been one of the ones
featured on an Internet web site titled Texas 100, devoted to
statewide recruiting. A recent entry noted, ``My commitment to TCU
is real strong. I'm just trying to get other players to come as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   If neither Schobel nor Stilley seize the No. 1 spot next year,
it's not that much of a stretch to imagine Franchione turning over
the job to the teenager Printers. If he didn't, the new staff would
face going into its third season, the 2000 season, still without
its quarterback in place.
</P>
<P>
   For Franchione's spread-option system, the quarterback is
everything. At New Mexico, the system helped turn Stoney Case and
Graham Lee into Western Athletic Conference offensive players of
the year.

<P>
   TCU will lose 16 seniors, but a sound understructure appears to
be in place. Four freshman offensive linemen, all weighing 300
pounds, were redshirted and are expected to return in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Running back LaDanian Tomlinson, who had an outstanding season,
will be only a junior. But he will be pushed by nearly forgotten
Charles Jones and by LaTarence Dunbar of South Oak Cliff, one of
the redshirted freshmen, who may be the best of them all.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione redshirted 20 players, 15 of them freshmen, avoiding
the former regime's habit of rushing first-year players into
action. Three junior-college transfers that the staff recruited
were also redshirted.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike so many new head coaches who feel a mandate to hit the
ground winning, Franchione had the self-confidence to be patient.
The redshirts will give the 1999 Frogs rare depth.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me,'' Franchione said, ``that's how you build a program.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year's still-unannounced schedule begins in daunting
fashion _ Arizona at Amon Carter Stadium, followed by a road game
at Northwestern. But it is also not a stretch to imagine TCU _ the
eternal Underfrogs _ being voted as the preseason favorite to win
the trimmed-down 1999 WAC.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what the weather holds for TCU today in Las Vegas,
it won't be dark.

PROGRESS REPORTED IN DAY-LONG SESSION BETWEEN PLAYERS AND OWNERS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS throughout with updates.)   By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fearing that the season was in jeopardy, National
Basketball Association players and owners resumed negotiations
Friday for the first time since Oct. 28. In their longest
bargaining session during the nearly five-month-old labor impasse,
both sides made compromises.
</P>
<P>
   The concessions were made over the proposed implementation of an
escrow arrangement. The talks, which began at 10:30 a.m. at a
Manhattan hotel and continued until 10:45 p.m., struck a chord of
optimism unseen in the NBA's labor dispute since late last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say there's been some movement on both sides,'' NBA
Commissioner David Stern said Friday night. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When told of Stern's assessment, Danny Schayes, the vice
president of the National Basketball Players Association, said:
``That sounds about right. There have been compromises.''
</P>
<P>
   No plans were made Friday night for full bargaining teams to
meet again over the weekend, but there was the possibility that the
chief negotiators on both sides would speak. The players who
attended Friday's sessions planned to update their teammates
Saturday on the progress made.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling was that both the players and the owners wanted to
digest the new proposals before meeting again in a full session.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is against some new ideas, but there is some serious
fundamental differences of the way the two sides view the issues
and approach them,'' Stern said. ``I'm optimistic that there'll be
a deal, but the question is, after how much more damage to our
prospects?''
</P>
<P>
   As to whether an agreement could be struck by next week, Stern
replied, ``I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the atmosphere surrounding the negotiations was more
congenial than in the past. Patrick Ewing, the union's president,
joked with owners between sessions, and neither the owners nor the
players engaged in the rhetoric and posturing that had
characterized recent sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the progress will eventually amount to the league ending
the lockout, now in its 143rd day, remains to be seen. But any
softening of stances on either side was seen as productive toward
bridging the vast economic chasm.
</P>
<P>
   Implementing the escrow arrangement is considered one of the
biggest stumbling blocks in negotiations, along with limiting
high-end salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The escrow plan would take effect in the second or third year of
the proposed deal and would entail the players putting aside a set
amount of their salaries at the beginning of the season. Once a
percentage of salaries paid out to players had been exceeded _
somewhere between 50 percent and 60 percent of the league's $2
billion annual revenue _ the money would be used to pay the owners
back.
</P>
<P>
   The union had previously proposed putting 10 percent of the
salaries of all players except those making the minimum into an
escrow fund at the beginning of the season. Once a revenue split is
determined, the owners want the players to pay back all the money
over that figure.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the meeting on each side said they had moved a
couple of percentage points off their desired revenue split, but it
was unclear what those numbers were. The owners had been asking for
a 50-50 share of total revenue, while the players wanted to make as
much as 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The owners also agreed to accept, with several conditions, the
idea of a limit on the amount of escrow tax that could be withheld
from players' paychecks in the fourth, fifth and sixth years of a
proposed seven-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a couple of items, the parties reached out to each other on
some previously hardened positions,'' Stern said. ``We also
discussed a wide range of issues that somehow hadn't been fully
discussed before _ and that have to be discussed _ in order for us
to bust our way through to a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even with progress, the feeling was that the season would
not start until the first week of January at the earliest. &QL;

COYOTES MAINTAIN UNBEATEN STREAK  
 DRAKE'S GOAL SINKS SHARKS IN OT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   SAN JOSE _ There was a lot of streaking going on Friday night at
San Jose Arena.
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't just a frantic Curt Keilback, the Coyotes' veteran
radio voice, who got lost in the upper bowels of the stadium and
was late for the opening moments of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes kept streaking, too. They kept four streaks alive by
outracing San Jose, 2-1, in overtime. The most important: their
league-leading unbeaten streak, which has climbed to 10 (8-0-2).
</P>
<P>
   Right wing Dallas Drake scored the game winner, taking assists
from Tkachuk and Jeremy Roenick and beating backup goalie Steve
Shields with a top-shelf shot on an odd-man rush 37 seconds into
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Keith and J.R. did a super job getting the puck to me in
that situation,'' Drake said. ``They both showed a hell of a lot of
patience, and when it got to me, I knew I was going to shoot high
because he's a butterfly goalie.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I say? The streak's alive. But I think the difference
was (goalie) Nikolai Khabibulin. He just played fantastic for us
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the Coyotes' first victory in their past 20 overtime
games, which cover a span of two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes' winning streak is at four. Captain Keith Tkachuk's
point-scoring streak, the longest in the NHL, is at 10. And their
streak of allowing only two goals or fewer is at 13, which sets an
NHL post-expansion record.
</P>
<P>
   Not since there were only six teams in the league has a club
managed such a viselike defensive grip on opponents. The 1958-59
Montreal Canadiens did it 18 times. The NHL began its first wave of
expansion eight years later.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes (10-2-2) stayed even with Dallas in the race for
first place in the Pacific Division, and they were racing in front
of their own net during the final few minutes of regulation and
overtime. They played stellar defense reminiscent of their work on
the penalty kill, which also did the job.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix thwarted four San Jose power plays, running that streak
to a perfect 21 for 21 in its past five games.
</P>
<P>
   Khabibulin, back in the lineup after a four-game hiatus, seemed
relaxed and looked sharp in turning back 20 of 21 shots after
regulation. He didn't show any rust or any glitches with his right
stick hand, which was badly bruised a week ago in practice.
</P>
<P>
   He made a huge save on a Bernie Nicholls shot in the final
minute of the third period that saved the day.
</P>
<P>
   But San Jose center Marco Sturm foiled him midway through the
first period while the Coyotes were on their first power play.
Defenseman Mike Rathje, clearing out the puck from behind the
Sharks' net, made a long pass out to Sturm at the blue line, and he
raced in and fired one past Khabibulin at the 12:45 mark for a 1-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk tied it 11 seconds after Stephane Matteau went to the
penalty box for hooking Rick Tocchet. Tkachuk stick-handled a
rebound in front of the net and with Shields down, he wristed an
easy shot into the back of the net at 14:49.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks and their fans probably knew it was coming. Tkachuk
is a virtual Shark killer. Better even than actor Roy Schieder in
the movies. It was the Phoenix left wing's 23 goal and 43rd point
in 30 career games against the Sharks. &QL;

HEART OF UA DEFENSE LEARNS FROM ADVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ Handicapped kids surrounded him as he sat near a corner
of Arizona's practice field with a slightly sprained ankle wrapped
in ice. They held onto his shoe as though it provided life support.
They warily eyed anybody who approached as though they were there
to protect him.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Greer smiled. He felt grateful.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, sometimes we wake up, look around and see how easy
we have it,'' Greer said. ``Look at these kids. They know what it
is to work. They have to work and work for any little thing they
get. It's a privilege for me to be with them. From them, I learn.''
</P>
<P>
   From them, and from everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   Greer's four-plus years as an Arizona defensive lineman have
been nothing if not a learning experience.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons have not always been easy. One was about as
difficult as any could be. In 1996, Greer was caught in the middle
of a maelstrom that turned a rivalry ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Far from the cameras and football, Greer was hit in the back by
Arizona State's Glen Gable. The incident during a 56-14 ASU victory
at Arizona Stadium resulted in a brawl, player ejections, angry
comments, editorial-page commentary and an exchange of letters
between Arizona Coach Dick Tomey and ASU's Bruce Synder.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy has had an important impact on the ASU-Arizona
series as it returns to Tucson next Friday for the first time since
then. The coaches say they are taking a measured approach to the
volatile emotions that often precede kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the effort and intensity without the hate,'' Tomey
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tomey never has to look further than Greer to know what can
happen.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp Cochise in August, Tomey once lectured the media for not
giving Greer credit for growing beyond that angry moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all that garbage, look at what he has done,'' Tomey
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, not even Tomey could have imagined how important
Greer would become. He has emerged as the centerpiece of a
defensive line on a team that is only one win away from Arizona's
first 11-victory season ever. It's a defensive line that was so
unknown in August that it was predicted to be a major weakness. But
it has emerged to be the biggest surprise in a surprising season.
Greer's leadership has been a key, Tomey said.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to separate the steady, evident maturity of
today's Greer, 22, from the one who was blindsided a couple of
years ago. But Greer chalks it up as just another experience, a
battle in the education of a warrior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just football,'' said the 6-foot-2, 265-pound lineman,
who suffered a serious ankle injury as a result of Gable's hit. ``I
learned from it, but I've learned from a lot things. If you play
football, you accept that those kind of things can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Greer says, he doesn't have time to wallow in the
past. His wife wouldn't let him. Greer, a native of Salinas,
Calif., married his high school sweetheart, Candace, before the
1996 ASU game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candace helps me out a lot mentally,'' said Greer, who has a
degree in political science and is studying for a master's. ``She
has been with me through the trenches.''
</P>
<P>
   Candace, a student in veterinary medicine, also has thrown some
verbal shots to get her husband moving when he appears to be mired
in those trenches. Greer has often heard the verbal lash from
Wildcats defensive coordinator Rich Ellerson. But next to Coach
Candace, Ellerson is the big easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a tougher critic than the coaches,'' said Greer, who
leads the Wildcats with eight sacks. ``She always tells me when I'm
not running fast enough or working hard enough.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder that Greer won't accept any congratulations on
Arizona's season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed,'' he said. ``We lost to UCLA. But the
important thing is that we've been applying lessons from that one
ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, a horn blew. It was time for the Wildcats to meet
at midfield. He got his shoe and promised another one to the kid
who had been hugging it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be back with one, and I'll help you put it on,'' Greer
said as he left one lesson and headed for another. &QL;

   It was fourth and 8 with only 2:40 remaining in the game.
</P>
<P>
   No. 11-ranked Nebraska had possession at its own 32-yard line,
driving for what the Huskers hoped could be a game-winning
touchdown last Saturday in Manhattan, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   But quarterback Eric Crouch was sacked for a 12-yard loss by
Kansas State linebacker Travis Ochs. Television replays and photos
clearly showed that Ochs yanked down Crouch by the face mask.
</P>
<P>
   Oops.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no whistle and no penalty, and No. 2 Kansas State
held on to win.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on here?
</P>
<P>
   In other college and NFL games, notably in the waning seconds of
the Cardinals-Cowboys game Sunday, hankies are being left in
officials' back pockets. Controversial calls are dotting this
football season like chickenpox on a child.
</P>
<P>
   Is college and NFL officiating at its worst? Do the best teams
receive the best calls?
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday in Knoxville, Tenn., top-ranked Tennessee was on
the verge of being upset by Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   With Arkansas leading, 24-22, with less than two minutes to go,
quarterback Clint Stoerner faked a handoff and rolled left, where
he stumbled and fell. Stoerner's right hand, with the ball in it,
reached the ground first, causing the ball to squirt free.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee recovered and later scored the winning touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Did the referees err? Should they have ruled Stoerner down,
saying the ground cannot cause a fumble?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' SEC supervisor of officials Bobby Gaston said. ``The
college rule is for the ball to be ruled dead, some part of the
body other than the foot or the hand must touch the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are (missed calls) in every game at every level. But
this wasn't one of them. And we haven't missed anything that's
affected the outcome of a game this season. But it's not unusual
for us to sit an official down if there are several instances of
poor judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Was there such an instance in Sunday's controversial finish at
Sun Devil Stadium?
</P>
<P>
   To angry Cardinals fans, it appeared that quarterback Jake
Plummer's short incomplete pass to wide receiver Rob Moore in the
end zone on the final play of the game should have been ruled pass
interference against Dallas cornerback Kevin Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Fox television announcer John Madden and studio commentator
Terry Bradshaw agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was no flag, and the Cardinals lost, 35-28.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Seeman, the NFL's senior director of officiating, would
not directly address the play. Seeman, however, talked about other
topics, including what happens to referees who fail to measure up
to NFL standards and the so-called ``best team, best call'' myth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, when you're working a football game, you don't
even think of who's playing,'' Seeman said. ``You better think
about your job and making the correct judgment call, because if you
miss one, you'll be downgraded in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We constantly analyze and evaluate all the officials. It's
very competitive out there, and if someone does not perform or
shows no improvement, they're not asked back in the subsequent
year.''
</P>
<P>
   And that has happened quite often under Seeman over the past
eight years. Since retiring as a referee eight years ago, Seeman
has hired 64 officials for a staff of 112.
</P>
<P>
   Seeman said that before officials are promoted to the NFL, they
must serve a three-year stint in NFL Europe. To get to Europe,
officials must receive passing marks from Seeman's staff of 50
college scouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We scout 150 to 175 of the top college officials every year in
the country,'' Seeman said. ``Every year we take about the top 30
and send them to Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The very best make it to the NFL, where they are required to
partake in weekly four-hour training sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put together a training tape every week of about 45 to 50
plays that every (seven-man) crew must study,'' Seeman said. ``My
staff here (in New York) will spend six hours on a game going over
every play, and there are about 155 in every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll critique every official's previous week's game. And we
rate all of them. At the end of the year, the top-rated people get
postseason assignments.''
</P>
<P>
   With all the scrutiny, why are seemingly obvious mistakes still
made?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about 155 plays a game and a tight judgment call
going one way or another . . . people have to understand how
quickly things happen on the football field,'' Seeman said. ``You
don't have any idea until you're down there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, there's a (questionable call) or two here or there,
but you're talking about a lot of games. Nothing's perfect. It's
not a perfect game. But the number of errors this season has been
extremely rare.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaston admitted Wednesday that the Tennessee-Arkansas
officiating crew made a mistake by awarding a safety to Tennessee
when the Vols should have had the option of taking the ball deep in
Arkansas territory.
</P>
<P>
   The play in question occurred with about three minutes left and
Arkansas leading, 24-20. The center snap sailed over the punter,
who turned and chased the ball down. But while the ball was still
rolling inside the Arkansas 10-yard line, he kicked it out of his
own end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing this for 42 years, and I've never seen that
play before,'' Gaston said. ``I'm not trying to defend the
officials. We're paid to know it, we're supposed to know it, and we
just didn't come up with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach Tim Millis, Big 12 supervisor of football
officials, to clarify the non-call against Kansas State were
unsuccessful. &QL;

5-YEAR-OLD POKER FINAL: QUALITY TV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ

<TEXT>
<P>
   The trouble with all-sports networks is that they have 24 hours
to fill. You don't normally find college basketball games or NASCAR
races scheduled for the middle of a weekday afternoon, and you can
only broadcast so many exercise shows, no matter how many buff
bodies you squeeze into tight-fitting Lycra outfits.
</P>
<P>
   Which must be the explanation for how I wound up watching the
World Series of Poker on ESPN2 last week. The ``1993'' World Series
of Poker. (In case you somehow got confused and thought this was a
live broadcast, the interview with Telly Savalas _ noted dead
person _ set you straight.)
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the World Series of Cockfighting, immortalized on
``The Simpsons,'' but it was in the same general neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in its way, it was . . . fascinating, the same grisly way
watching Up With People sing a rock and roll song can be. And the
parallels between this and ``normal'' sports broadcasts were . . .
Wait, I'm getting ahead of myself.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament took place at Binion's Horseshoe, which you
couldn't miss; the beginning of the broadcast included a country
Binion's song playing as various Las Vegas scenes were shown. A bad
song, yes, but nothing worse than what Hank Jr. warbles before
``Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   You know you're in for top-quality sports programming when your
host is Dick Van Patten. He spoke in a golf analyst's whisper as a
camera panned across the various tables set up for the tournament.
We would be watching the ``premiere event'' of the World Series,
the $10,000 no-limit Texas hold 'em.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Albrecht, the tournament director, was introduced, and Van
Patten announced that he and Albrecht would be calling _ and this
is how they described it _ the play-by-play action. Madden and
Summerall they ain't, but the idea was the same.
</P>
<P>
   We were then introduced to the finalists, six men from all over
the world, including one fellow who wore a sweat suit jacket with
the sleeves rolled up past the elbows _ always a classy look _ and
Jim Bechtel, the defending champion, who hailed from Coolidge.
</P>
<P>
   Albrecht explained the game and the terms _ the button, the
small blind, the big blind, the flop, etc. _ which doesn't happen
in, say, a baseball game. But there have been times when I've
wished I had an explanation for what Tim McCarver was trying to
tell me.
</P>
<P>
   It was impossible for a novice such as myself to keep up with
what was going on (despite all that, ahem, expert commentary), but
gradually, players were eliminated. Along the way, we heard the
same cliches we hear during every NBA broadcast (remember those?)
when a player nails a couple of free throws with the game on the
line, including the old favorite, ``He looks like he has ice water
in his veins.''
</P>
<P>
   Loathe as I am to admit it, when you see a guy bet $120,000 on
one hand _ that's a house! _ you can't help but get sucked in and .
. . THIS IS 5-YEAR OLD POKER! GET A HOBBY, MAN!
</P>
<P>
   A man named Mansour Matloubi lost and wouldn't shake hands with
anyone. Then he bolted from the casino (he later returned) with the
camera following him. It looked just like an NFL game, when the
camera lingers on a distraught defensive back who blew his coverage
on a game-losing touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   Between hands, members of the crowd talked about a new, younger
generation of players coming up. Remind you of anything? The
talking heads at NBC hoping _ praying _ that somewhere out there,
the new Michael Jordan is lacing up his sneakers?
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Bechtel won the $1 million first prize. Afterward,
he could have been Jeff Gordon when he said, ``I came in today to
win. Would have been disappointed if I hadn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. Maybe it's not that coverage of the World Series of Poker
was just like that of every other sport. Maybe coverage of every
other sport is just like that of the World Series of Poker. &QL;

TKACHUK WANTS 2002 OLYMPIC SPOT

<P>
   SAN JOSE _ Coyotes captain Keith Tkachuk hopes to participate in
the Winter Olympics again, despite Team USA's disappointing finish
in Nagano, Japan, and the fallout from a dorm room trashing
incident.
</P>
<P>
   After the United States was eliminated from the medal round,
Tkachuk was quoted as saying, ``This was a total waste of time.''
The comment made headlines, but for all the wrong reasons, Tkachuk
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to go back,'' Tkachuk said this week during a
conference call with reporters. ``I think a lot of people obviously
took that quote out of context. Most of the people who know about
hockey knew what I meant. I said if we didn't win, it was a waste
of time. Maybe it came out differently, but that's the way I felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I loved being over there. It wasn't a waste of time being
over there. . . . That was a great experience. I want to go back to
Salt Lake (in 2002) so we can redeem ourselves, because we're a
much better hockey team.''
</P>
<P>
   NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman has not announced whether the
league will suspend part of the 2001-2002 season to allow NHL
players to compete for their respective countries. A decision could
come by February. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Still sitting &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the third straight game, Coyotes enforcer Jim Cummins was a
healthy scratch, and the club played without a true ``heavyweight''
to handle any potential rough stuff by the Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the decision to sit Cummins has to do with getting
second-year pro Brad Isbister more ice time. But the Coyotes also
feel they have enough team toughness to counter Cummins' absence.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk said the Coyotes best players ``can handle themselves,
more or less.'' &QL;

SHORT SIGNING PERIOD AFFECTS PIPPEN QUEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When or if the NBA's labor war ends, a mad scramble to sign the
best free agents will ensue before the shortened season begins. The
signing period could be as little as two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But if that time comes, don't be surprised if the Suns decide to
pass on small forward Scottie Pippen, who was atop their wish list
at the end of last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns could be cooling on Pippen for several reasons. First,
he had off-season back surgery, and because of the lockout, teams
are unable to communicate with players or their representatives.
The Suns may not have time to fully evaluate Pippen's health before
they must make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Pippen turned 33 in September, which plays into the
third factor _ the length of contract he will seek or that will be
needed to pay Pippen what he is worth.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of the contract could be preordained by the labor
agreement that's being negotiated. If the base number is limited,
that means it will take more years to make the average reach what
Pippen is thinking.
</P>
<P>
   It's always possible that the Suns may find out when the lockout
ends that Pippen's back is fine and that his contract demands are
not outrageous. But it's doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, expect the Suns to address their size problem first.
The free agent most likely to move to the top of the list is
forward Tom Gugliotta, who played for Minnesota last season.
Gugliotta, at 6-feet-10 and 240 pounds, has the flexibility in his
game to play all three frontcourt positions.
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta, 28, was drafted out of North Carolina State by the
Washington Bullets with the sixth pick of the first round in 1992.
In six NBA seasons with the Bullets, Golden State Warriors and
Minnesota Timberwolves, Gugliotta has averaged 16.6 points and 8.8
rebounds a game. He averaged more than 20 points and 8.7 rebounds a
game in two seasons with Minnesota and made his first All-Star Game
appearance in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the team can keep forward Antonio McDyess _ which is no
small assumption, given Houston's interest in him _ the Suns could
have two of the league's best, most versatile forwards in the game.
</P>
<P>
   It also could leave the Suns with enough money to go after a
free-agent center such as Luc Longley. Or another free agent. If
Minnesota hangs on to Gugliotta, the Suns could pursue a center
such as Vlade Divac.
</P>
<P>
   But, as a league source familiar with the free-agent situation
put it, ``Don't expect to see Scottie Pippen in a Suns uniform.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Others to watch &QL; 
 &QL; 
Even with a major signing, the team has a lot of work to do to fill
out the roster. In particular, the club will likely need another
point guard, or at least a player who can work at either guard
position off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Some players who are likely to be considered include:
</P>
<P>
   Alvin Williams, a 6-5 second-round pick of the Portland Trail
Blazers in 1997 who finished his rookie season with Toronto. He had
a solid season and scored a season high 19 points against Phoenix.
He was traded to Toronto as part of the Damon Stoudamire deal.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Cory Alexander, a 6-1 veteran of three seasons. He
was waived by San Antonio last season and picked up by the Denver
Nuggets. Alexander is a 37.7 percent career three-point shooter.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Respert, the eighth player taken in the 1995 draft, who
already has been with four teams and played with three. He was
drafted by Portland, which sent his rights to Milwaukee. The Bucks
traded him to Toronto, which released him in March.
</P>
<P>
   He was signed to a pair of 10-day contract late last season by
the Dallas Mavericks. At 6-2, Respert is in between shooting-guard
and point-guard sizes. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Places to play &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Players Association and some agents have said they might
organize charity ``All-Star'' games featuring NBA players if the
lockout continues.
</P>
<P>
   The first was to be in Las Vegas, but no site has been booked.
Phoenix is a city that has been mentioned, with Veterans Memorial
Coliseum the venue.
</P>
<P>
   Danny McCall, the booking director at the Coliseum, said he has
had a conversation with one person, whom he would not identify,
about hosting such a game. However, the talks didn't go far.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never got past the first stage,'' McCall said. ``We would
like to have it, though. If they're interested in having a game in
Phoenix, my phone line is open.'' &QL;

WILL STOTTLEMYRE HELP LURE JOHNSON? 
</HEADLINE>

 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that free-agent right-hander Todd Stottlemyre has agreed to
sign with the Diamondbacks, what's next?
</P>
<P>
   Will the fact that Stottlemyre is coming aboard send enough of a
signal to left-hander &QL; 
Randy Johnson that the team is serious about upgrades?
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know how the spirit could move Randy, or when,''
Diamondbacks General Manager Joe Garagiola Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hoping that he would view this as a pretty tangible
piece of evidence about us being competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Garagiola also cited the recent signings of left-handed middle
reliever Greg Swindell and first baseman Greg Colbrunn and the
trade for young outfielder Dante Powell as reasons for improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some, those are less obvious examples, but to us, they are
significant,'' Garagiola said.
</P>
<P>
   To ascertain if there were any hints of a direction toward which
Johnson might be leaning, The Republic attempted to contact his
agents, Alan Nero and Barry Meiser, on Friday, but they did not
return phone messages.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who has offers from his previous team, the Houston
Astros, and the Texas Rangers, was due to meet with officials from
the Anaheim Angels and Los Angeles Dodgers in California and might
announce his decision before Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if Randy doesn't sign, we've still got a solid rotation
in Stottlemyre, Andy Benes, Omar Daal and Brian Anderson,''
Garagiola said.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential member of the rotation, right-hander Armando
Reynoso, is scheduled to get an evaluation from the Diamondbacks'
medical staff today. It was to have been done Friday, but it was
pushed back a day because of a family commitment. If the team
receives medical approval, a contract likely will be offered to
Reynoso, who was 7-3 for the New York Mets in 1998. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Bernie watch &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reports out of New York had center fielder Bernie Williams
turning down a five-year, $60 million offer from the Yankees. The
Diamondbacks remain in contention, but it is uncertain where they
stand in his mind, or perhaps more to the point, in the mind of
agent Scott Boras.
</P>
<P>
   Managing General Partner Jerry Colangelo spoke with Boras on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks deny they have made an offer to Williams.
Initial reports had them proposing a deal at seven years for $100
million, and recent rumors have pared those figures to four years
at around $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every player is a moving target, and there are a lot of teams
laying in the weeds,'' Garagiola said. ``It's one of the more
fascinating times of the year _ the dynamics of it all.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Trade talks &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks also are taking the trade route to reshape
their roster.
</P>
<P>
   Garagiola said the team had conversations going with at least a
couple of clubs at the recent general managers' meetings in Naples,
Fla., that could resume at the annual winter meetings in
mid-December in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something could very well come together by then,'' he said. &QL;

UA SETTLES WITH PLAYER IN SCHOLARSHIP FLAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN VAN DER WERF  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rather than face trial, the University of Arizona has decided to
pay $125,000 to a former baseball player who alleges that the
school defrauded him by promising him a scholarship and then
kicking him off the team after two years.
</P>
<P>
   Although this is an isolated case, the announcement of a
settlement sent shivers through university athletic departments and
threatened to further complicate the already complex world of
recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the case, UA has instituted an extensive training
program with coaches involved in recruiting to help prevent them
from making promises that they cannot keep.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State, after hearing of the case, also said it will take
precautions to assure the same thing doesn't happen there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be precedent-setting because the court might have
been about to decide that there was a verbal contract,'' said Betsy
Mosher, senior associate athletic director for compliance and
administration at ASU. ``It could send a shock wave across
departments like mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick McMillin, a seldom-used right-handed pitcher on the 1994
and '95 UA teams, was dismissed from the squad in the fall of 1995,
his junior year. He was able to keep his scholarship for the rest
of the year but was told it would not be renewed after that.
</P>
<P>
   McMillin alleged in his claim that former UA Coach Jerry Kindall
promised him that his scholarship would be renewed every year as
long as he made progress toward getting his degree, avoided
``significant disciplinary problems and continued to go out for the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   McMillin asserted that based on Kindall's assurances of a
scholarship for up to five years, he gave up significant bonuses he
could have received if he had signed to play professional baseball.
</P>
<P>
   UA did not admit wrongdoing, but school attorneys said they
decided to settle because they would have faced significant costs
if the case had gone on to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (McMillin) alleges that he was promised he would get a
four-year scholarship, whether he played or not,'' said Judith
Leonard, UA's general counsel. ``We don't believe this happened,
but sometimes you have to make a business decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Under NCAA rules, athletic scholarships are guaranteed for one
year only. A coaches is allowed to say that he or she will
recommend to the financial aid office that the scholarship be
renewed every year, and that the financial aid office always has
followed that recommendation in the past, said Michael Proctor, a
UA attorney who works on athletic compliance issues.

   The new UA training program for coaches will stress ``a uniform
format to recruiting techniques . . . discouraging approaches which
might lead to ambiguous interpretations as to the terms of
scholarship offers,'' according to a summary of the litigation
released to the state Board of Regents. The regents approved the
settlement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Mosher was not familiar with details of the McMillin case, but
she recognized the name. She said his parents, Pat and Freda
McMillin of Lakeside, Calif., ``papered the Pac-10 with letters for
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The family was seeking to get NCAA rules changed so scholarships
automatically would cover four years instead of one, Mosher said.
She said she doesn't believe the NCAA has taken up the issue.
</P>
<P>
   McMillin and his parents could not be reached for comment
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Mosher said ASU coaches are constantly reminded of the rules on
recruiting, and she said she will use this case as a cautionary
tale. &QL;

CARDS PREPARE FOR CLIFFHANGER VS. REDSKINS  
 GAMES SELDOM END IN BLOWOUTS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Cardinals defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis describes games
against the Washington Redskins the past few years as
``cliffhangers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not just close games,'' he said. ``They're pacemaker
games, and that's a big difference to me.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinnis was clutching his heart as Joe Nedney kicked a 47-yard
field goal with two seconds left to beat the Redskins, 29-27, two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Kevin Butler kicked a 47-yarder for the Cardinals
with two seconds left to send the game in Washington into overtime.
The Redskins wound up winning, 19-13, the third overtime game
between the two teams in four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it happens once or twice, I think you just say it
happened that way,'' Redskins Coach Norv Turner said. ``But the way
it has happened over the last five years, the teams have been
evenly matched, whether it has been low-scoring games or whether we
had some games pretty interesting and high-scoring. Both teams play
with confidence. Both teams feel they can win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are 6-3 against Turner going into Sunday's game
against the Redskins at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium. But only one of
the games has been a blowout.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in the Cardinals' four victories over Turner's Redskins
at Sun Devil Stadium, all were decided in the final minute by a
total of nine points. Each of the Cardinals' two wins in Washington
came on a field goal in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The most thrilling victory was two years ago, when the
Cardinals, 3-6 at the time, went to RFK Stadium to play a
Washington team that was 7-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thought we'd get slaughtered,'' said wide receiver
Anthony Edwards, who is on injured reserve this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins led, 34-20, early in the fourth quarter when former
Cardinals quarterback Boomer Esiason put on a passing show. He
wound up throwing for a team-record 522 yards, third most in NFL
history.
</P>
<P>
   He tossed three touchdown passes, including a 12-yarder to
Edwards with 20 seconds left in regulation to send the game into
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams missed field goals in overtime. Then Butler hit a
shaky 32-yarder, giving the Cardinals a 37-34 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ```It was one of the most exciting games I've ever been involved
in,'' fullback Larry Centers said. ``It was one of the wackiest
games I've ever played. We went tit for tat, back and forth. I'll
never forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that season, the Cardinals had to come from behind again
to win.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Kent Graham drove them 69 yards in 15 plays to set
up a Butler field goal try on the game's final play. He hit from 28
yards to give the Cardinals a 27-26 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we play them, we're up, but then they play harder and
come back,'' center Mike Devlin said. ``Then they're up, and we do
the same thing and come back. It's crazy. One team is up, the other
comes roaring back.''
</P>
<P>
   Nedney said his game-winner two weeks ago was the biggest kick
of his career, bigger than his personal-best 53-yarder to win at
Detroit the previous week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is No. 1 because it was at home,'' he said. ``It was my
first ever game-winner at home. It was the first time I heard the
crowd cheer instead of shutting up.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback J.J. McCleskey, who blocked a punt for a touchdown at
Washington a year ago, said he is tired of the close calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was at Tennessee,'' he said, ``we had a saying that
when you get ants on the ground, don't tap your feet and kill them.
Get a sledgehammer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game I've played against them has come down to the last
play. Two weeks ago, that was incredible for the fans. As a player,
I can't deal with those types of games.'' &QL;

KANSAS STATE COACH EASES MEDIA BAN ON QB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Wizard pulled back the curtains in Oz the other day and
showed the world that he's human.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State Coach Bill Snyder admitted earlier this week that
he was wrong for preventing quarterback Michael Bishop from
speaking to the media after the Wildcats' monumental victory last
Saturday over Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder hadn't allowed Bishop to speak with print reporters since
early October. Before playing Colorado, Bishop made some comments
that Snyder found bothersome.
</P>
<P>
   That started a cute little post-game dance with the media.
Reporters, who are not allowed into Kansas State's locker room,
were allowed to request interviews with Bishop. And Snyder would
deny them.
</P>
<P>
   But Snyder loosened the muzzle some last week, allowing ESPN to
interview Bishop. And after the Nebraska game, he let Bishop talk
to Sports Illustrated, but not to the other 500 or so media at the
game.
</P>
<P>
   This prompted much criticism in the press that Snyder was acting
like a dictator and costing his senior quarterback a chance at the
Heisman Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Never before had such a large contingent of media gathered in
Manhattan, Kan. It was the finest moment in Kansas State's football
history, and Snyder came across as both a genius and a dictator.
</P>
<P>
   But last Tuesday, Snyder apologized and made Bishop available.
</P>
<P>
   ``I offer no excuses,'' Snyder said. ``It was a mistake on my
part. I've apologized to Michael, and I apologize to you and I will
apologize to the other media who were here at the time and didn't
have the opportunities I afforded one magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder deserves credit for admitting his mistake.
</P>
<P>
   But shielding Bishop is something that probably would have ended
anyway the week of the bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   The participating teams in the four Bowl Championship Series
bowls will receive $11 million to $13 million apiece. For that kind
of money, bowl officials and sponsors expect to see a team's
starting quarterback at interview sessions. &QL;  &QL; 
Tomey's deal &QL;  &QL; 
Dick Tomey, 60, often says he can see himself coaching into his
late 60s or early 70s. The question the last few years, however,
has been whether Tomey will last that long at Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   It now appears likely that he will. Tomey, in the last year of
his current deal, was given a five-year contract earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a difficult decision by UA officials. The Wildcats are
10-1 and ranked eighth in the country, and any fan of the school
who thinks Arizona can do better than Tomey is mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona fans also shouldn't forget where the school ranks in
college football's pecking order. The Wildcats are never going to
be able to compete nationally for the country's best players. And
in Southern California, they won't win many recruiting battles with
UCLA and Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   What Arizona has to do, and what Tomey is good at, is
identifying prospects who are overlooked by others because of
slight imperfections. That's what Tomey has done in signing players
such as quarterback Keith Smith and former defensive lineman Tedy
Bruschi.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, he is going to reach and miss. There are going to
be seasons like 1995 and '96, when the Wildcats won a total of 11
games.
</P>
<P>
   And there are going to be seasons like this one, where the
recruiting chances pay off and everyone stays healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The program is stocked with young talent, particularly on
defense, and capable of contending for Pac-10 titles over the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
   It's only fitting that Tomey stays in Tucson to see it. &QL;  &QL; 
Bizarre finish &QL;  &QL; 
After the Cardinals came from behind in the closing seconds to beat
Washington two weeks ago, defensive end Andre Wadsworth was asked
whether that was the most amazing game in which he had played.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite, Wadsworth said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Wadsworth's Florida State Seminoles were trailing
Florida, 31-3, heading into the fourth quarter at Doak Campbell
Stadium in Tallahassee. The Seminoles rallied to a 31-31 tie in a
game that's known in Florida as ``The Choke at Doak.''
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry will be renewed today in Tallahassee, where Florida
Coach Steve Spurrier has never won and where the Gators haven't won
since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The winner still has a legitimate shot at the national title.
But the fourth-ranked Gators and fifth-rated Seminoles will need at
least one of the top three teams _ Tennessee, UCLA or Kansas State
_ to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're thinking about is, `Just beat those guys to put
ourselves in position in case some of those other guys lose,' ''
Spurrier said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those three undefeated teams keep squeaking by each week, but
all of them have a bunch of games left that they've got to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida is in the unique position of possibly winning a national
title but losing the Southeastern Conference crown. The Gators
likely are shut out of the SEC title game because of their loss to
Tennessee. But if the Vols and another undefeated team lose,
Florida probably will jump ahead of them in the BCS polls. &QL;  &QL; 
Quick kicks &QL;  &QL; 
Quick quiz: What graduate of a Phoenix high school is a leading
contender for some coach of the year honors? Answer below.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi State is in familiar territory. Last year, the
Bulldogs could have advanced to the SEC title game by winning their
last two games against Arkansas and Mississippi. They lost both
games. They are in the same position this year.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Brannon of Mansfield (Pa.) University finished the season
with 1,024 rushing yards. So what, you say? He's the first running
back in school history to go over 1,000 yards, breaking a 105-year
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Quiz answer: Massachusetts Coach Mark Whipple, who graduated
from Camelback in 1975. Whipple is in his first season at UMass
after going 24-16 the previous four years at Brown. The Minutemen,
2-9 last year, are 8-2 and can clinch a Division I-AA playoff berth
with a victory today over Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   UMass is ranked seventh in the country and is sixth in total
offense and 10th in scoring.
</P>
<P>
   In two games against Michigan, Ohio State quarterback Joe
Germaine has completed just 17 of 48 passes for 232 yards and a
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Germaine, from Mesa Mountain View, has completed 61 percent of
his passes this season and thrown for 21 touchdowns. A fine year,
but Germaine knows his legacy as a Buckeyes quarterback is on the
line today.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people's memories are going to be predicated on
whether we're successful against Michigan and how I play,'' he
said. ``And I understand that.'' &QL;  &QL;

YELEY EYES NASCAR  
 MAY ALSO BE OFFERED FULL-TIME IRL POSITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Could J.J. Yeley be next to bolt the open-wheel campground?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But not tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Yeley will attempt to qualify for Manzanita Speedway's first
U.S. Auto Club National Midget Series race in 17 years and past
history suggests he will be one of the drivers to beat in the
30-lap main event.
</P>
<P>
   Then what?
</P>
<P>
   Yeley, who stuck the equivalent of his big toe in Indy Racing
League waters this season, is looking down the road and what he
sees has six big letters _ NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   ``In January or February, I'm going through the Buck Baker
Driving School (in Atlanta),'' said Yeley, who attended Apollo High
School. ``I'm talking to a couple of (NASCAR) Busch teams, and
something might be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IRL is definitely getting stronger every year, and either
(NASCAR or IRL) would be great to be with. But right now, NASCAR is
the premier division to be running with. And I don't want to limit
myself to doing one thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Yeley, who nurtured his home-grown talents on Valley
racetracks such as Manzy and Canyon Raceway, isn't likely to
completely turn his back on open-wheel racing.
</P>
<P>
   Not like Jeff Gordon. Or Kenny Irwin Jr.
</P>
<P>
   At age 22, with a trunk full of talent, Yeley doesn't need to
rush the future. Not now. And not even next year or the year after.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Yeley still may be offered a full-time IRL position
next year, which some members of his camp believe is a ``95
percent'' certainty.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens, Yeley also will drive a Gary
Zarounian-owned USAC Silver Crown machine in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going for the points championship,'' said Yeley, the
1997 USAC sprint car rookie of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Zarounian can hardly wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've sold my new car dealership (in Visalia, Calif.) and we're
going racing full time,'' Zarounian said. ``I'm excited about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Zarounian, whose car formerly was driven by Donnie Beechler,
hired Yeley late this season and the Glendale driver produced two
wins in five starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``J.J. caught my attention earlier this year, but I didn't think
he was ready yet,'' Zarounian said. ``Then I saw him some more, and
when we decided to make the (driver) change, I thought (Yeley) was
the guy to put in the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like his attitude, his personality and his talents. He's
done a real good job.''
</P>
<P>
   IRL car owner John Menard also gives Yeley a thumbs up. Yeley's
IRL debut was earlier this season at Phoenix International Raceway,
where Menard put him in a third car. Yeley qualified 10th.
</P>
<P>
   At the Indianapolis 500, Yeley qualified 13th and finished a
season-high ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Although Menard was considered Yeley to replace Tony Stewart,
who is pursuing a NASCAR Winston Cup career, he recently chose Greg
Ray.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought J.J. did real well and it was a difficult
decision,'' Menard said. ``But I hired Thomas Knapp to be general
manager of my race team and his background is with (Ray). That was
one of the overriding factors in choosing Greg over J.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I still think (Yeley) has a future in the IRL. It just
probably won't be with us at this time. The timing is off.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeley believes he might have warranted a closer inspection had
his IRL performance not tailed off the final three races.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first two races went really good, but I had the (Nissan)
Infiniti engine the last three races and I don't know if that hurt
my performance or not,'' Yeley said. ``I felt like it might have
because here I was trying to do engine testing instead of
concentrating on jump-starting my career.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the experience I gained doesn't hurt at all. I definitely
needed all the laps I could get. I'm just happy I was even
considered. Just the publicity of being in the IRL and the Indy 500
has to help.''
</P>
<P>
   So, no, Yeley wasn't surprised when Ray was officially announced
as Menard's new driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``After (Menard) hired Tom Knapp, the writing was pretty much on
the wall,'' Yeley said. It was known last year that Greg Ray didn't
really want to drive for someone like an A.J. Foyt. He wanted his
own deal, where he could have some control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think John is giving them that option.''
</P>
<P>
   What Menard's decision gave Yeley was the freedom to pursue
other avenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``For young, up and coming drivers, I think the IRL or NASCAR is
the way to go,'' Yeley said. ``(Championship Auto Racing Teams)
isn't even an option for most of us. So that's what I'm looking at.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm going to do so some sprint and midget races next year,
along with the Silver Crown. I'll still be busy.'' &QL;

GEORGE NEEDS TO BRING BEST BACK TO INDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An open letter to Indianapolis Motor Speedway President Tony
George:
</P>
<P>
   Dear Tony,
</P>
<P>
   First, I must applaud you for seemingly having your heart in the
right place.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the philosophy behind your creation of the Indy Racing
League is admirable.
</P>
<P>
   Providing an avenue for top young open-wheel talent in this
country is something the sport desperately needs. While it has been
a slow and not entirely successful process at this point, it's good
to see the intent is there to allow future Steve Kinsers an
opportunity to prove or disprove their Indy car worthiness.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to come up with playing rules to help contain costs also
is a noble cause. Who wouldn't be in the market to try to save a
buck?
</P>
<P>
   That's the good news.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is this:
</P>
<P>
   By changing the playing rules, you've also changed the
Indianapolis 500. That's my only regret. You've transformed the
greatest spectacle in racing to the greatest non-spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, Tony, but it's the truth. And I know you don't sense
that.
</P>
<P>
   If you did, you would have done more than what you did regarding
this week's engine rule change. You would have made it practical
for Championship Auto Racing Teams officials and engine
manufacturers to warrant seeking a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Since you were the one to change the Indy 500 rules, you should
be the one to mend the fence. But you won't. We know that now more
than ever.
</P>
<P>
   From what I can extrapolate, you are convinced the IRL and CART
should go their separate ways. You believe the IRL doesn't need
CART, and maybe it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   But what you need to realize is even the Kentucky Derby is
nothing without all the top horses in the starting gate.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, you don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't matter how many fans fill your seats at the Indy
500. It's still not the same. There's no electricity, no sizzle in
the air.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the Indy 500 is supposed to be about the greatest
drivers in the land attempting to crack a 33-car starting lineup.
At the moment, that's not happening.
</P>
<P>
   And the argument that the race is open to anyone is laughable.
</P>
<P>
   CART owners' pockets aren't so deep that they can invest in IRL
equipment to run in one race and one race only.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if rules governing both sanctioning bodies were identical,
you could have your IRL and CART still could have its series.
</P>
<P>
   The best news of all, however, would be that everyone again
would gather at Indy in May.
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of the Indy 500, I hope it happens soon. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Sincerely, &QR; 
Mark Armijo &QR; 
No surrender &QL; 
 &QL; 
IRL fans didn't appreciate the printed matter in this space a week
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Of 22 e-mails and a half-dozen telephone calls, 95 percent
disagreed, some vehemently, with my opinion that the Indy 500 no
longer is the greatest race in the world.
</P>
<P>
   One called me an idiot and two suggested I was a CART shill. One
even referred to me as a sycophant. Yikes.
</P>
<P>
   Another reader suggested that ``Indianapolis Star'' columnist
Robin Miller and I are the two biggest boneheads in America. Hey,
anytime I can be mentioned in the same sentence as Miller, who is
one of the sport's top reporters, I'm happy.
</P>
<P>
   But my view hasn't changed. Tony George changed the rules, and
when he did, he changed the Indy 500 for the worst. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Hold the sushi &QL; 
 &QL; 
If anyone needs a bolt of good news, it's Darrell Waltrip.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip will drive the No. 88 Quality Care Ford Taurus for Dale
Jarrett tonight in a NASCAR exhibition race in Motegi, Japan.
Jarrett is recovering from gallbladder surgery, which he underwent
Monday in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   After the race, however, Waltrip will be unemployed. At the
moment, he has no ride lined up for next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like getting a chance to drive the 88 car will be a big
plus for me,'' Waltrip said. ``It's coming at a great time. I need
a little platform here to kind of sell from over the winter as far
as looking for a deal for next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip is one of several drivers still in limbo. Others without
guaranteed 1999 employment include Geoff Bodine, Morgan Shepherd
and Dick Trickle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 51 and people have hounded me for the last two years, and
I mean that literally, hounded me to get out of the car and go do
TV and go do other things,'' Waltrip said. ``But that's like me
calling the president of a corporation and saying, `Hey, you need
to retire. You've been there too long. Let somebody else run the
company for a while.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't feel that way. I still feel good. I still want to
race, and I still want to win. My pride is the same as anybody
else's pride. I want to win races and then quit, not lose races and
then quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the pressure, all the motivation, all the things that I

IN THE GAME OF COMPETITIVE BASEBALL, PAUPERS NEED NOT APPLY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When general managers gather each November a couple of weeks
after the World Series, they spend several days in meeting
discussing issues that affect their game and their teams. The
post-season often is on their agenda of topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are eight clubs that are talking about post-season
rosters,'' Doug Melvin of the Texas Rangers related, ``and the
other clubs are saying, `What should I have to worry about that
for?'''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin exaggerated but only slightly. More than eight teams had
a shot at the playoffs this year, but the number didn't include
teams that had payrolls below $48 million. As the disparity in
payrolls grows, that threshold number grows, too. Such a premium is
placed on the price of winning that relative paupers need not apply
for post-season spots.
</P>
<P>
   This year the Houston Astros were the playoff team with the
lowest payroll, $48.3 million. Last year the Astros made it with a
payroll of $34.2 million, the San Francisco Giants with $44.1
million, the Seattle Mariners with $45.6 million. In 1996 San Diego
got there with a $33.4 million payroll, Los Angeles with $37.3
million, St. Louis with $37.6 million and Texas with $41.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   And as the price of winning escalates, the reality of losing
sends payrolls plummeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only are payrolls going up, but they're also going down,''
said Sandy Alderson, a long-time Oakland Athletics executive who
recently became Major League Baseball's vice president for baseball
operations. ``We lose sight of the fact that there are some clubs
that are giving up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those at $20 million and say to themselves going to
$30 million doesn't appreciably change their chances, and there are
those at $30 million who say we're no better off at 30 than at 20,
so they go down. What you end up with is the extruding of the list
so that you have some at this end, a lot at this end and no one in
the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's payrolls ranged from Baltimore's $71.9 million to
Montreal's $8.3 million. The Orioles, with the only losing record
among the 13 teams that had payrolls of more than $48 million,
clearly underachieved, but the Expos didn't have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payroll disparity results from revenue disparity and leads to
competitive disparity,'' Alderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Owners and club officials see disparity as the No. 1 problem
facing baseball today.
</P>
<P>
   ``One can't help but be concerned,'' commissioner Bud Selig said
Friday. ``I've heard the competitive balance thing for a lot of
years, and for a long time it didn't play, but as stakes get higher
and disparity grows, everyone ought to have concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   In the labor agreement that emerged from the 1994-95 players
strike, the owners and players adopted a revenue sharing plan under
which the large-revenue teams would pay money into a pool from
which the smaller-revenue teams would receive money. The aim of the
plan was to reduce revenue differences.
</P>
<P>
   This year the Yankees are expected to pay the most, a little
more than $11 million, while the Expos will receive the most, about
$12.5 million. But those payments won't make much of a dent on what
one baseball official said was a $135 million difference between
the teams' revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Beattie, the Expos' general manager, acknowledged that his
team probably receives more money than anyone else. Without it, he
added, ``We might have ended up losing money.'' But the fact that
the Expos did make some money might rankle the clubs that make
deposits into the revenue-sharing pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't like giving us money,'' Beattie said, ``and then we
cut back and maybe make some money. We're not operating for the
good of the game right now. We don't want to operate that way.
We've been in a survival mode. We can't move from that position
until we get some assurance that we're not going to shoot ourselves
in the foot all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Fehr, head of the players union, said it would be
premature to judge the revenue sharing plan before it reaches
full-scale implementation, which won't happen until the 2000
season. The plan was 80 percent operational this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not far enough along so that we can meaningfully judge
what is going to happen,'' Fehr said. ``Until we are, we can have
our opinions, but they don't mean very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Braves General Manager John Schuerholz did not see
the current economic system as a solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic reality,'' he said, ``is that teams that operate
in large markets and have more income, generate more revenue, sell
more tickets, sell more sky boxes, sell more executive suites and
get better support from corporate sponsors are going to have more
money to spend. Teams that operate in the bulk of our markets, the
mediocre size markets or small markets, aren't going to have that
revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   A new park, Jacobs Field, transformed the Cleveland Indians from
a low-revenue team into a high-revenue team, a potential payee into
a payor under the revenue-sharing plan. Teams like Milwaukee,
Pittsburgh and Montreal desperately hope new stadiums can work that
kind of economic magic for them.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers' Melvin said another general manager put the new
stadium-as-panacea issue in perspective: ``He said that is a
short-term solution, but in the long term you'll just be losing in
a prettier ball park.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hart of Cleveland basically echoed that view when he was
asked what it would mean for teams with new parks if the Yankees
got one, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Yankees get a new stadium and enhanced revenues, it's
going to be almost impossible,'' he said. ``You should see the
Yankees every year in the playoffs and that's not good for the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jim Bowden of Cincinnati said low-revenue teams don't have the
right to expect to be able to spend like high-revenue clubs.
``That's not realistic,'' he said. But, he added, ``We have to make
sure that the difference isn't as large as it is now.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point, Bowden said: ``The Players Association has to
come forward and say `It's a problem for us, too. We're not
maximizing the dollars.'''
</P>
<P>
   Alderson said the union would most likely become involved in
trying to find a solution to the problem when it becomes in the
best interest of its membership.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they find that 80 percent of their players feel they're out
of the pennant race even before the season starts, then it's an
issue that is common to both of us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alderson said it may become necessary to allow some teams to
move to alter their part of the disparity or to change the method
of sharing national television revenue so that needier teams gain a
larger share than wealthier teams.
</P>
<P>
   Some general managers noted the larger-scale revenue sharing the
National Football League operates. ``In the NFL,'' Herk Robinson of
Kansas City said, ``when they pass the pie plate, you can close
your eyes and take a piece, and it's all the same. Ours go from
slivers to half pies.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cam Bonifay of Pittsburgh said the revenue disparity is
``capitalism in its purest form'' and will never be eradicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to do your job as well as you can through player
development and scouting, then get yourself in position where you
make good baseball decisions,'' he said. ``You might have a two- or
three-year period where you have this group of players you can
count on and then add to them and be very competitive for a
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Alderson said if the problem can't be solved in a purely
economic way, it may become necessary to attack the matter from
another direction, seeking ways to make teams more competitive, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, he said, teams on the wrong end of the competitively
imbalanced scale could get more players from the amateur ranks or a
way could be figured out to enable them to keep their salary
arbitration-eligible players without affecting the arbitration
process.
</P>
<P>
   Attacking the problem from the competitive direction, Gord Ash
of Toronto suggested the possibility of expanded playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would give more clubs opportunities in the post-season,''
he said. ``I think North American fans have grown to appreciate
playoff situations.''
</P>
<P>
   He admitted the idea in baseball bordered on heresy, but he went
bravely on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see why you couldn't go to at least five teams
initially,'' he said, meaning the addition of one team in each
league. ``This year you'd have given the Yankees a bye and let the
other four knock themselves out. Then let the three teams remaining
have a round-robin.''
</P>
<P>
   Ash said the playoffs could even be expanded up to eight teams
in each league but conceded, ``That's probably too many.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden proposed his own radical plan to make races more
competitive. Establish divisions by revenue, not geography, he
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put Cincinnati in with Pittsburgh and Montreal and Florida,''
the Reds' general manager said, ``and let those teams have a
pennant race. They may win 60 or 70 games, but at least the fans
know they're in a pennant race. That's not good for baseball, but
it would be a better solution than clubs being eliminated on May
20.''

MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO: TIM FLOYD WAITS, AND WONDERS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa., Ms., La., Mont.)   By IRA BERKOW    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEERFIELD, Ill. _ Some 35 cardboard boxes, many already sagging
under their own weight, are piled high against a wall outside the
coach's office on the second floor of the Berto Center, the Chicago
Bulls' training facility. They have occupied that spot for nearly
four months, and belong to a man who is, more or less, neither here
nor there. He is Tim Floyd, Basketball's Man Without a Definite
Capacity.
</P>
<P>
   He is either the new coach of the world champion Chicago Bulls
and successor to Phil Jackson, or he is not. He is either the
team's director of basketball operations, a new Bulls designation,
or he is not. He is either their new sweeper of the equipment room,
or he is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I signed my contract in July with the Bulls,'' Floyd
said, sitting not in the coach's office, nor in the office of the
director of basketball operations _ for there is none _ but in a
small conference room, ``I said I'd do anything they wanted me to
do. If it was to coach the team, or scout, or look at films, or
even sweep out the equipment room, I'd do it. I'd do whatever made
people comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   By ``people,'' he meant Michael Jordan. ``I don't want to be the
person who is said to have driven the greatest player to ever play
the game out of the game,'' Floyd said.
</P>
<P>
   This was a monumental concern before he took the job _ rather, a
job _ and is still a kind of Damocles' sword over Floyd's
44-year-old neck. After all, Jordan had said last season that he
would play for no other coach than Jackson. He has hedged on that,
but a question remains: Would he play, at this point in his career,
for someone with no professional experience as either a player or
coach?
</P>
<P>
   And while Floyd has not unpacked and moved into Jackson's old
office _ it doesn't seem appropriate to him, sensitive to the faint
sliver of possibility that he may not be the coach _ he does spend
16 to 18 hours a day in the dark of a film room studying the
triangle offense and the octopus-like defense that have helped make
the Bulls so successful. He has studied opposition strategies and
player tendencies, and sought to understand why timeouts were
called when they were, why substitutions were made when they were.
And he has sought like enlightenment from assistant coaches and
others in the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be ready for whatever happens,'' Floyd said. ``I
want to be ready to contribute to the organization. What we do is
prepare for Plan A _ with all the players back _ and Plan B, if not
all of the players return.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hard Work and Politics Mark His Entrance &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Krause, the Bulls' general manager, was first impressed
with Floyd 10 years ago when Floyd was the coach at the University
of New Orleans and ``beating teams his level of personnel had no
business beating.'' Krause said about Floyd's work ethic around the
Berto Center, ``No one comes in earlier, and no one leaves later.''
</P>
<P>
   And as the lockout continues, with 10 free agents _ including
Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman, the heart of the title
team _ among last season's 14 roster players, there is also a great
deal of posturing and politicking, subtle and overt, involving the
team.
</P>
<P>
   Politics with the Bulls is the basketball equivalent of what
transpired in the Byzantine Empire. After winning six championships
in eight years, Jackson decided to resign as coach. Some felt he
was pushed by Krause, though Jackson has denied that, saying that
though he and Krause had a falling out, the team's owner, Jerry
Reinsdorf, had steadfastly but without success sought Jackson's
return for at least another season.
</P>
<P>
   Whereupon, Jordan said he would not play for any other coach.
Jordan now says that he has not decided, and will do so only after
the owners' lockout of the players is settled.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan did, however, give the impression early on that he would
not play for Floyd, who had been courted by Krause to, it was
obvious, replace Jackson. And the impression spread that Floyd was
not just a fishing buddy of Krause's _ they had made a couple of
fishing trips together _ but that he was Krause's ``boy,'' as the
saying went.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd, the head coach at Iowa State for the last four years, saw
a challenge with the Bulls and wanted to join the organization _
``I know that if I went there, sooner or later I'd be coaching
there,'' he said _ but didn't want to do anything Jordan didn't
want him to.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd knew that if he did anything to displease His Airness, he
would be vilified in Chicago and perhaps nationally _ possibly
internationally _ and castigated and berated, hurdles that even a
highly confident, idealistic and still rather boyish-looking coach
might not be able to overcome. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Floyd got into coaching because, he said, ``as a basketball
player I was terrible.'' He was a walk-on at Southern Mississippi,
the school where his father, Lee, had been head basketball coach
until his death in 1971, when Tim was a high school senior. After
spending time on the bench there for two years, Floyd transferred
to Louisiana Tech. In his junior year, he was told by Coach Emmett
Hendricks, ``I think your future is in coaching.'' He made Floyd a
student assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   Upon Floyd's graduation, Don Haskins of the University of Texas
at El Paso hired him as an assistant coach. Floyd stayed there for
nine years, before becoming head coach at Idaho for two years, New
Orleans for six and then Iowa State. He compiled a 243-130 record
in 12 years as a college head coach, taking his teams to five NCAA
tournaments and two NIT tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The first word that comes to mind about him as a coach,'' Iowa
State Athletic Director Gene Smith said of the 6-foot-2-inch,
200-pound Floyd, ``is `intense.' He's always mentally into the
game, and I think the players drew from that. When the game
started, he'd take off his sport jacket and throw it to the end of
the bench. He'd loosen his tie, and he'd prowl the sidelines, a
program rolled up in his fist. He had a game face, and he
produced.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Hoiberg, now with the Indiana Pacers, played his senior
year for Floyd at Iowa State. ``Tim took over for a legend, Johnny
Orr, but from Day One he let us know who was boss,'' Hoiberg said.
``He can be a yeller, but he does it for a purpose. He's actually
calm, though, especially with X's and O's under pressure. Everyone
I know who has played for him has respected him.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd married his college sweetheart, Beverly, and they have one
daughter, Shannon, a high school senior in Ames, Iowa. Wife and
daughter will join Floyd in Chicago when Shannon graduates next
spring. While Shannon concerns herself with grades, her father
concerns himself with making the grade.
</P>
<P>
   And making Jordan feel comfortable. Since there was a lockout
and management _ apparently even potential management _ was
prohibited from speaking to the players, Floyd, before deciding to
take the Bulls' job, used intermediaries to feel Jordan out.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sounding Out Jordan With Well-Placed Calls &LR;
</P>
<P>
   He called two friends in the coaching fraternity, Buzz Peterson,
the head coach of Appalachian State and a former teammate of
Jordan's at North Carolina, and Roy Williams, head coach of Kansas
and an assistant when Jordan played for the Tar Heels in the early
1980s. Williams and Peterson told Jordan essentially the same
thing: ``Tim doesn't want to do anything that is even close to
running you off.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams recalled recently that he spoke to Jordan and told him
that Floyd ``was a good guy, interested in basketball and not a
puppet for management, a coach concerned about his players.''
</P>
<P>
   And as Williams related, Jordan told both of his old friends:
``I have no problem with him. He has to do what he has to do, and I
have to do what I have to do. Time will tell.'' Jordan added,
however, ``Tell him that if he wants the job, he should take it if
it is offered.''
</P>
<P>
   So, said Floyd, ``I felt that Jordan might feel comfortable
about my being here, and it wouldn't affect his decision to
return.''
</P>
<P>
   But Floyd still seemed concerned with Jordan's comfort level. He
wanted to speak to Jackson, regarding two points. One was: what
could Floyd learn from him about the Bulls' playing system? The
other was this: ``If Phil in any way harbored a desire to return, I
was more than willing to step aside. Whatever were his wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   When Floyd accepted the new position as director of basketball
operations at a salary of close to $8 million for five years, he
did so at a news conference on July 23 in which Reinsdorf stated
that he was still hoping Jackson would return. Jackson, from his
home in Montana, viewed this cynically at the time. ``I didn't know
I'd have to retire a second time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a strange situation, most of it designed to placate
Jordan _ if, in fact, he even needed placating. No one was quite
sure. Least of all Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things he did was seek to keep Jackson's _ and,
in a sense, Jordan's _ assistant coaches, Frank Hamblen, Bill
Cartwright and Tex Winter. Especially Winter, the creator of the
vaunted triangle offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he felt it was very important that I stay on the bench
with him,'' Winter said. ``He made it clear that he didn't want to
change anything. `If it ain't broke, don't fix it,' was his
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd had expressed interest to Winter in meeting Jackson one
day. ``Phil was in town and I had had dinner with him and asked if
he'd like to meet Tim,'' Winter said. ``Phil said, `Why, fine,
certainly. I'd like to talk to Tim.'''
</P>
<P>
   The two first talked on the phone. ``We talked for about an hour
and a half, about what he did and why he did it,'' Floyd said. ``I
took notes the whole time.'' Sometime after that, Floyd visited
Jackson at the suburban Chicago house in which Jackson was living.
``It was a good chat,'' Floyd said. He did not want to reveal
particulars, nor has Jackson, who declined to be interviewed for
this article.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very compatible,'' Winter said. ``I knew they would
be. They're both fine guys. Good men. Both outstanding coaches and
very thorough. I'm sure Tim will do an excellent job as a head
coach in the pros. I'm just worried that the press will give him a
fair shake. I think so far they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he was also worried for Floyd's sake. ``I told
him,'' Williams said, ``that he may be going into a hornet's nest.
He said, `I like the challenge.' Of course, Jackson won with
exceptional talent. If that talent isn't there, well, the
expectations may or may not still be there.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Players Weigh In &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kerr, the guard and one of the Bulls' free agents, said:
``From what I hear, Floyd is doing all the right things, saying all
the right things. He's smart. He should do OK''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, who last December said he would never play for the Bulls
again, and did, said recently that Jackson's departure ``depletes
my enthusiasm'' to return to the Bulls ``to a great degree.'' But
the jury is still out on him.
</P>
<P>
   And Jordan said recently: ``I have no problem with anything Tim
Floyd has done. I didn't know that he saw Phil _ it's the first
I've heard of it. But are you asking whether that will influence my
decision to return? The answer is no.''
</P>
<P>
   And Floyd recalls what Rodman had said when it was learned that
Floyd, a college coach, might succeed Jackson: ``He said, `It's a
joke.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls' director of basketball operations _ he still has not
been named head coach _ smiled ruefully. ``I just took his
statements as loyalty to Phil _ same as Michael,'' he said. ``I
admire that. I can only hope that when all is said and done, they'd
all feel good about me if I got an opportunity to coach them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's in store,'' Floyd added. ``Everything is
still kind of up in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Including, as usual, Jordan, the essential star in the Chicago
firmament.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Floyd would reveal only one piece of advice that
Jackson offered. ``It would probably really help you if Michael
came back,'' Jackson said, straight-faced.
</P>

 HE'S No. 3, BUT GIANTS ARE TALKING ABOUT CHERRY   By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Cherry made news this week by not doing a thing.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Giants' third-string quarterback, Cherry was the
only quarterback on the team not affected when the starter, Danny
Kanell, was demoted last Wednesday and his backup, Kent Graham, was
promoted. And yet, in the wake of that reversal, Cherry's relative
anonymity ended.
</P>
<P>
   There was a nagging question raised by Fassel's decision to at
least temporarily pull the plug on the Danny Kanell era, a question
that could only have been asked in today's culture of the
quarterback, the most debated, analyzed and singularly scrutinized
position in sports.
</P>
<P>
   If Kanell isn't the team's quarterback of the future, then who
is?
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Kanell may still be the quarterback of the
future. Enter Mike Cherry, the sixth-round choice in 1997 out of
Murray State.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cherry will not play Sunday against the Eagles unless
the game is a rout, he found himself a frequent focus of
conversation this past week. Already considered the most physically
gifted Giant quarterback, Cherry seems to have emerged as something
of a people's choice.
</P>
<P>
   Even if few, including the coaches, really know what he can do
once the huddle breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to get him in a game,'' Fassel said of Cherry on
Friday. ``I'd like to see how he'd play and react, too. But how
many teams find ways to get their third quarterback in the game?''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel has bigger priorities. His team's last victory was five
weeks ago. He's more worried about Kanell's confidence than
Cherry's growth. And he'd like to rediscover the fearsome defense
he lost somewhere along the way this season.
</P>
<P>
   But Fassel could make Cherry the second-string quarterback and
use him as a second-half substitute, or even start him in one of
the late-season games, especially if the Giants are only playing
for first-round draft position.
</P>
<P>
   Evaluating Cherry might be valuable heading into next year's
training camp, or next spring's draft, when the Giants might be in
the market for a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Other young players, like wide receiver Joe Jurevicius, center
Derek Engler, linebacker Ryan Phillips, and safety Shaun Williams,
may receive limited tryouts Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry, meanwhile, politely waits his turn. A courtly,
strapping, 24-year-old raised in Texarkana, Ark., he was worried
last week about ruffling feathers or speaking out of turn. He has
talked of wanting to support Graham and Kanell.
</P>
<P>
   But he has some big aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the guys give me a good razzing about my accent,''
Cherry said of his twang. ``I didn't know I had an accent. I guess
I do. But you know what, Brett Favre is an old country boy, too.
That's the way I think of myself. I'm a real simple guy, but I got
plans and I can get things done.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherry hasn't had an easy road to the National Football League.
In Texarkana, which straddles the Arkansas and Texas border, his
high school team ran the wing-T and threw the ball sparingly.
Cherry still passed for 22 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   He went to the University of Arkansas, but after two years and a
coaching change _ not to mention the installation of another
run-based offense _ he decided to transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Division I-A programs like Texas, Southern Mississippi and
Louisiana State made offers. But so did Murray State _ and because
Murray State is in Division I-AA, Cherry would not have to sit out
a season if he transferred.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big risk,'' Cherry said. ``But I wasn't thinking
about making it to the pros, I was thinking about how I wanted to
play where they threw the football and relied on the quarterback to
make a lot of reads and decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't care about whether I played on television or how many
people were in the stands. I wanted to have fun playing football
and that's why I went to Murray State. Turns out we won a lot, got
on regional TV and the crowds tripled.''
</P>
<P>
   But he wasn't selected until the sixth round _ probably because
he came from a Division I-AA program, Rick Donohue, the Giants'
assistant general manager, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question his skills are better than
a sixth-rounder,'' Donohue said. ``We were fortunate if you
consider his size and arm strength.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6 feet 4 inches and 225 pounds, Cherry has had the Giants
wondering what the possibilities will be for him since he arrived
in minicamp last spring. But while he has looked polished in
practice, he has played little, even in preseason. This year, the
Giants have had punter Brad Maynard and wide receiver Amani Toomer
attempt passes, but not Cherry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm eager, but I'm patient,'' said Cherry, who will almost
certainly play in the NFL's World League during the off season. ``I
really feel like everything from college to the draft has worked
out for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he spends two and one-half hours every night studying
the Giants' playbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a childhood dream of mine to be a coach when I'm
through here,'' Cherry said. ``And this is my chance to take full
advantage of where I am right now. I'm like a doctor going to
medical school and I'm at the top level.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel, a quarterback tutor, has good things to say about
Cherry, though he has been measured in his praise of him this week
_ in part, perhaps, because he wants to keep the focus on
rebuilding Kanell's confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike knows the when and why of things and understands the
concept of a play _ how a little change can affect the coverages or
blitz pick-ups,'' Fassel said. ``There's a lot of progress in
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherry has not let the commotion surrounding the quarterback
change _ and the attention it has brought him _ to turn his head
too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just another week of work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Mike Cherry is not even the most famous person in his
family. His brother, Marty, is a model for several international
clothing and eyeglass designers. Marty's face is regularly in
full-page magazine and newspaper ads, something Mike Cherry is
frequently reminded of inside the Giants' locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the guys will see Marty on the back of a newspaper and
bring it over to me,'' Cherry said Friday. ``They'll say, `I guess
we know who got all the good looks in your family.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Now what can I say to that?''

NFL NOTEBOOK: COACHES IN TROUBLE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few people in the National Football League will say anything
negative about coach Ted Marchibroda of the Baltimore Ravens. He is
a good man, but he is a good man in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens expected to be better than their 3-7 record. Usually
when expectations are not met, the coach is blamed, and at the end
of the season it is highly likely that Marchibroda will be
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   A league executive with knowledge of the situation said that if
Marchibroda were removed as coach, he would be asked to remain with
the Ravens' front office. Ravens owner Art Modell would say only
that he has ``high regard for Ted Marchibroda.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't made any decisions yet,'' Modell said.
</P>
<P>
   Another year, another round of ``Coaches in Trouble.'' Among the
others are:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PETE CARROLL, PATRIOTS &LR;  _ Until the team's move to Hartford was
announced, the talk of Boston was Carroll's response to a reporter
who had aggressively challenged Carroll to explain the Patriots'
blowout loss to Atlanta. When Carroll's explanations fell short,
the reporter pressed harder and Carroll appeared passive. Stories
in the news media the next day portrayed Carroll as soft because he
did not tell off the reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll is not a typical professional head coach; he is not a
control freak who has his players, and the media, terrified of him.
That's to his credit. But he appears to be losing his team, which
is a disappointing 5-5 and in fourth place in the American Football
Conference East Division.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when Carroll was the coach of the Jets, one week the
team was 6-5 and playing Miami for first place. Then, in the blink
of an eye, Carroll's defense was burned by Dan Marino's fake spike
and subsequent touchdown pass. After that, the Jets collapsed,
losing their last 5 games and finishing with 10 losses. There were
accusations, some from Jets players, that the team had quit on
Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Now, those same accusations are being made in New England. After
a playoff loss to Pittsburgh last year, Patriots defensive end
Willie McGinest cursed at Carroll in front of the entire team. This
season, players say privately that Carroll's relaxed attitude leads
to players' taking their time coming back from injuries and sloppy
play on the field.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, Carroll is not a candidate to be in trouble
because he has three years remaining on a contract that pays him
some $1 million a season. But if the Patriots don't make the
playoffs, he could get a quick hook.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BRUCE COSLET, BENGALS &LR;  _ The last several years Coslet teams
have been cold in the first half of the season and hot in the
second. Not this year. The Bengals have just two victories, and
recently quarterback Neil O'Donnell was benched for Paul Justin. If
Coslet is not dismissed, it will be a small miracle.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JUNE JONES, CHARGERS &LR;  _ When Kevin Gilbride was dismissed
earlier this season, Jones was seen as someone who would keep the
seat warm until another coach was hired. That is, unless Jones
turned around the team _ and rookie quarterback Ryan Leaf. Neither
has happened.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NORV TURNER, REDSKINS &LR;  _ Washington may be the most
disappointing team in the league. Turner's job could be saved if
the owner, John Kent Cooke, can keep the team, which is for sale.
Cooke is a big fan, but even he must be concerned that Turner has
been completely ineffective in motivating his players and in four
years has not made the playoffs. His career record is 28-45-1.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RAY RHODES, EAGLES &LR;  _ Despite his 2-8 record, Rhodes is still
regarded by many in the league as a top coach. He has mainly
faltered in his drafts. When he leaves the Eagles after this
season, he will most likely receive offers, possibly as a defensive
coordinator in Baltimore or Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Third-Grade Trash-Talker &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An NFL owner called the final minutes of the Denver-Kansas City
game one of the most embarrassing moments in professional football
history. The night may not have been quite that bad, but it was bad
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it gave fans a realistic portrait of the true viciousness
of professional football.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, punching, kicking and other cheap shots happen
underneath the pileup, unseen by television cameras and the naked
eye. Not in this game. Millions watching ``Monday Night Football''
saw the Chiefs' Derrick Thomas elbow quarterback Bubby Brister in
the head and linebacker Wayne Simmons throw an uppercut to the jaw
of tight end Shannon Sharpe. Sharpe, in retaliation, later dived
onto the back of Simmons' legs.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs suspended Thomas for one game _ which amounts to a
$35,000 fine _ Simmons was kicked off the team and Sharpe was fined
$10,000 by the league, a fine he is appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe is the one who started all the nonsense. He is the most
skilled trash-talker in the league and has always made a target of
Thomas, who usually keeps his cool.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is not the only one Sharpe can set off. The muscular
tight end has long known how to anger people with his words.
</P>
<P>
   ``This started at a very young age,'' Sharpe said of his
trash-talking. ``I was in speech class and the teacher always told
us that if somebody gets to a word and they can't pronounce it, you
let them sound it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I'll never forget, the guy got to a word, and she says,
`Johnny, it sounds like ... it sounds like ...' I said, `It sounds
like Johnny can't read.' That was the beginning. From the third
grade on, I knew I had the ability to make people upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe is a Pro Bowl tight end, and a world champion agitator.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Extra Points &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Tennessee Coach Jeff Fisher should start getting serious
consideration for coach of the year. His Oilers are 6-4 over all
and 5-1 in the American Football Conference's Central Division and
the team has not really had a home for two years. ``We've been
through an awful lot the last couple of years,'' he said. ``Next
year when we move into the new stadium here in Nashville, we will
have played in our fourth home venue in four years. The travel and
all the things associated with the move and the relocation,
distractions, have been something that I don't wish on anybody.''

SPORTS COLUMN: A RELUCTANT ROLE MODEL  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Ohio)   By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Opening day of the New York Mets' 1997 season is still a blur to
Pete Harnisch, who started the game thinking he had a firm grip on
both the baseball and his life. Within weeks, he was one of the
most public of the estimated 19 million Americans who experienced
depression that year. His willingness to reveal his illness and his
solid comeback last season with Cincinnati have made him something
of a mental health role model, if a slightly edgy one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no crusader; don't give me this bold, stepping-out
stuff,'' Harnisch said last week. ``I just think a guy should do
what's right, which is letting people know you can get through this
thing, you can get your life and your personality back.''
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch calls ``this thing,'' which cost him most of his eighth
big-league season, a ``depressive episode.'' He recoils at being
considered a poster boy for depression. He is not comfortable with
the term ``mental illness.'' His own explanation is that his body
chemistry was destabilized when he abruptly quit a 13-year chewing
tobacco habit during spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Even such a reluctant role model as Harnisch is rare and
courageous in sports, where the discussion of any kind of mental
illness doesn't seem to have progressed much beyond the 1950s Jimmy
(``Fear Strikes Out'') Piersall story.
</P>
<P>
   SportsWorld alternately hides and rewards behavior that would be
considered antisocial, if not downright dangerous, in most other
industries. It rarely pays attention to any emotional problems
unless they interfere with performance.
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch, a bluff, direct 32-year-old, crew-cut and bull-necked,
steered away from such abstract discussions last week during a
two-hour conversation at a Freehold, N.J., diner near where he is
living. The interview had been promoted by a public relations firm
representing SmithKline Beecham, the pharmaceutical company that
manufactures Paxil, the antidepressant Harnisch took for six
months. The company pays Harnisch to make appearances and give
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   A hard-driving, sometimes tempestuous right-hander who kicks
walls and water coolers when his fastball fails to pop, Harnisch
was neither dramatic nor particularly clinical in his descriptions
of that lost season. He made it clear that certain details _
including side effects from the drug and the effect of the illness
on his relationships _ were too personal to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch says his problems began in late March 1997, with an
almost casual decision on a Miami golf course to stop ``dipping,''
at least temporarily. He could not recall, he says, any early clues
to future depression. At the tail end of the exhibition season, a
few days after quitting tobacco ``cold turkey,'' he woke up
sweating heavily, a first. He was chilled and experienced a
murkiness, as if he were moving through a fog. Usually one of the
louder and more convivial clubhouse characters, he suddenly ``felt
like an outsider.'' He wondered if he was coming down with a virus,
then if he had a brain tumor. He was unable to sleep more than an
hour or two a night, and lost his appetite.
</P>
<P>
   He confided mostly in his wife, Donna, and the Mets' trainer,
Fred Hina, who eventually gave him sleeping pills for the night
before his opening-day start, in San Diego. He still didn't sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Jocks plow through. Harnisch dimly remembers five good innings
before the Padres hit three straight home runs. He insists the hits
were ``a freak'' and had nothing to do with his condition. He felt
``cooked'' after the game, and slept well that night. He figured he
had come through the crisis. Then it got worse. He lost more weight
_ eventually 35 pounds from a 6-foot, 228-pound body _ and was too
weak to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets sent him back to New York for tests. After an eventual
diagnosis of depression, there was talk and drug therapy. He was
placed on the disabled list and began a long, slow rehabilitation
that included a stint in the minors. It was his idea to reveal his
condition in a conference call with sportswriters in late April
1997, rather than concoct a story about a physical illness. Of
course, he considers it a physical illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know me, who I am, and I never looked in the mirror and
said, `You are mentally ill,''' he said. ``There was down time and
self-doubt, but I see it mostly like a long cold, a cold in my
brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch returned to the Mets that August. Last year, with the
Reds, he started 32 games, winning 14 and losing 7, and posted an
earned run average of 3.14. He has been on the short list for
various comeback awards.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to judge whether he is remarkably unself-aware or
truly successful at ``putting it all behind me.'' He says he is the
same as he was before, yet different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm stronger now,'' he said. ``After Brett Butler came back
from cancer, he said that what he went through put baseball in
perspective, it was just a game, and I thought, `yeah, yeah,' but
now I know what he meant. You have a tendency to let the game run
your life, to be miserable after a bad game, a bad article.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean I'm not still competitive, I still throw
temper tantrums when I pitch bad, and there are things that still
scare me. Like this.'' He poked his finger into his mouth. ``I got
to go see the dentist today. It could be root canal.''

PARCELLS SEES OILERS AS BIG TEST FOR JETS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ This is the difficult position the New York Jets
find themselves in, and they are not alone: they are in a stretch
run, and yet for the race to remain on a level course, they need a
victory here against the Tennessee Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   So the Jets are focusing on Sunday, but some part of them is
thinking ahead. They are 6-4, the Oilers are 6-4. In fact, it seems
that most teams in the American Conference are close to that record
with six games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mama said take one day at a time,'' said defensive lineman
Bobby Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jets' surrogate father, Bill Parcells, went out of his
way last week to look ahead and explain to the players the
significance of this game in the context of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the bottom line,'' he told them. ``There are six games
to go. No team's schedule is any more favorable than ours.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' final six games come against teams with a combined
won-lost record of 30-30. The Dolphins, 7-3, and in first place,
will face teams with a 41-19 record. The Bills, tied with the Jets
at 6-4, will meet teams with a combined mark of 27-33. The 5-5
Patriots will battle teams with a 35-25 mark.
</P>
<P>
   First up for the Jets are the Oilers, whose Eddie George is
averaging more than 120 yards rushing a game since October, and
whose defense held the Steelers' Jerome Bettis to a total of 55
yards in two games. Thus, the Oilers show strength in the two
categories that every club depends on to win in the NFL: running,
and stopping the run.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets counter with Curtis Martin, who will be trying to churn
it out on the ground after coming off a 100-yard effort at
Indianapolis, his fifth of the season. The Jets' defense has also
has had impressive games, halting Marshall Faulk, Karim
Abdul-Jabbar and Jamal Anderson. This time it will be attempting to
stop George.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the rest of the game plan? The week before the
season opened, Parcells noted what he thought were unsettled areas.
How well the Jets have addressed these areas will be pivotal
against the Oilers:
</P>
<P>
   _New punter Nick Gallery holding for place-kicker John Hall.
Last year it was the experienced Brian Hansen.
</P>
<P>
   Result: Neither Gallery nor Hansen lasted, and now John Kidd
will be punting to one of the league's poorer return units. It
averages only 6.9 yards.
</P>
<P>
   _Establishing a perimeter passing game; that is, getting the
wide receivers into the action.
</P>
<P>
   Result: Keyshawn Johnson, Wayne Chrebet and Dedric Ward form one
of the most dangerous threesomes in the NFL. Chrebet and Johnson
have 15-yard averages.
</P>
<P>
   _Getting Glenn Foley ready for his first season as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Result: Foley is now on the bench, and Vinny Testaverde has
proved to be one of the most effective quarterbacks of the season.
In the Oilers, he meets a defense that allows 63 percent of
opponents' passes to be completed. That unit has failed to distress
quarterbacks by producing only eight interceptions and the fewest
sacks in the league.
</P>
<P>
   _Open-field tackling by defense; halting big plays.
</P>
<P>
   Result: Tackling could continue to plague the Jets. The misses
against the Colts were crucial in the 1-point loss last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   _Production from tight ends Kyle Brady and Fred Baxter.
</P>
<P>
   Result: Brady's best season includes four touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   With their committed running game, the Oilers have a better
possession time than the Jets (by one second) and have also been
able to halt third-down plays almost two-thirds of the time in the
last month. Of course, much of that has to do with getting early
big leads.
</P>
<P>
   There is an outside chance that Sunday's game could ultimately
decide a wild-card berth between the clubs. Their head-to-head
result would only matter if they had the same record.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, however, will try to wrest the division title outright
(something they have never done since the American Football League
and National Football League merger of 1970).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got four teams in our division in contention,'' said
Parcells, ``and maybe nine or 10 for playoff spots. I told the
players, `Did you think it was going to be easy? Five of our six
games left are with playoff contenders.'''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells also said, ``I'm not bringing in the big picture yet,
other than to mention Denver and Jacksonville as clubs that seem to
be above everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The big picture,'' said center Kevin Mawae, ``has a lot of
little parts to it. Of course I know the standings and the
schedule, but you learn never to look beyond this week. If you're
looking beyond it, it's too far.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, still listening to his mother, admitted, ``At this
point, you have to think about the rest of the schedule, but you
have no control.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that since his high school days, he has never looked at
a schedule once the season began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we're playing the Oilers now,'' he says. ``Who's after
that? Carolina?''

   WASHINGTON _ This city has always kept an unwritten list of
foreign leaders _ dictators, unfriendly authoritarians and
consistently annoying allies _ who it thinks can make an enormous
contribution to peace, security or America's agenda by taking early
retirement, at a minimum. In the 1950s, the leftist leaders of Iran
and Guatamala made the Top 10, in the '60s it was populated by Diem
and Sukarno and other Southeast Asians. President Richard M. Nixon
and his advisers infamously agreed at a secret meeting in the '70s
that the best way to deal with the government of Salvador Allende
Gossens in Chile was to ``make the economy scream.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatic etiquette, though, has usually discouraged shouting
America's enemies list from the White House rooftop. After all,
foreign policy isn't about personalities, right? But last week,
driven by frustration, or anxiety, or perhaps the lure of sounding
tough for cameras, the Clinton administration piped up, twice. In
very different situations, in opposite corners of the world, the
United States spoke loudly because it can't find a stick.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, hours after he called off an attack on Iraq, Clinton
finally volunteered the obvious, that the focus of U.S. policy
toward Iraq is the removal of President Saddam Hussein _ what
Clinton called supporting the ``forces of change in Iraq.'' No
matter that covert efforts to do just that have failed miserably.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger surprise came Monday, when polite-to-a-fault Al Gore
used his visit to Malaysia for an Asian economic summit meeting to
throw U.S. support behind protesters calling for ``reformasi,'' the
code word on the streets of Kuala Lumpur for dumping Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamed. He has long been a burr in Washington's side,
denouncing America, its currency traders and its Jews. He recently
imprisoned his Western-thinking finance minister, Anwar Ibrahim,
who has suddenly become Asia's most visible jailed dissident. But
Mahathir is no Saddam, not by a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides insist that his speech was a call for reform, not a
demand that Mahathir step down. But it wasn't interpreted that way.
The New Zealanders called it ``megaphone diplomacy.'' The Malaysian
government called it ``disgusting'' and an ``interference in
internal affairs.'' Predictably, executives of several U.S.
companies that have flocked to Kuala Lumpur told the Malaysians
that Gore was rude, while assuring Washington that he had uttered
words that needed to be said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the wisdom of the Gore's words, they raised the
question of what it takes these days for the world's most powerful
nation to begin publicly suggesting that it's time for a nettlesome
leader to go. Because there is no official list, there are no real
criteria for getting on it.
</P>
<P>
   Some leaders mysteriously escape mention, like Kim Jong Il of
North Korea. President Clinton is spending the weekend on the
Korean Peninsula, staring across the demilitarized zone at a
dangerous state that everyone suspects is attempting to break out
of its 1994 agreement to freeze its nuclear weapons projects, in
return for billions in Western energy aid. Yet Washington has never
called on the starving North Koreans to revolt against Kim's
repressive regime. His government, taking a page out of the Saddam
playbook, suggested last week that if the United States really
wants to look at a mountain tunnel that the Pentagon believes is a
nuclear installation in the making, it should write a check for
another $300 million. No one even called for Kim's removal when, a
few months ago, he lobbed a three-stage missile over Japan just to
show he knew how.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules for calling for the end of a regime are pretty
murky,'' said Richard Feinberg, a professor at the University of
California at San Diego who served in the Clinton administration's
first term. ``When they really want to push someone out, it is
because that country is part of a larger strategic concern at the
time. But the country itself usually doesn't have great strategic
weight'' _ it's another matter to call for a change of leadership
in Beijing or Moscow _ ``and it helps if there is some kind of
domestic opposition that we can point to.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's call for Saddam's ouster last weekend created barely a
ripple because, after all, he is a proven murderer and an avid
stockpiler of anthrax and plutonium (even if Brent Scowcroft, who
was President George Bush's national security adviser, insisted
last week that Saddam nowadays is simply ``an irritant, an
annoyance, a pest and a problem, but not a threat to the region at
the moment'').
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir, however, is far more complex case. He's a prime
example of how opposing Washington's political and economic agenda
for an interconnected world can move a leader from the list of
authoritarians whom Washington tolerates to the list of
authoritarians who have outlived their usefulness.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Asian strongmen _ Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines
and Suharto of Indonesia come to mind _ he was useful when the fear
was that Malaysia would become a communist domino. But he also
seemed eminently tolerable long after the Cold War was over. He has
never been accused of enormous corruption. He turned his country
into a model of competitiveness, and Malaysia became the exemplar
of the ``big emerging markets'' that Clinton's Commerce Department
touted until things went sour last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he was always prickly. But he is no terrorist or killer _
U.S. companies have flocked to his country, and say they want to
stay _ and his iron control over political discourse is no stronger
than in neighboring Singapore. Just this summer, U.S. Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin paid him an ostensibly friendly, if
strained, visit and made no reference to human rights.
</P>
<P>
   That all changed when Ibrahim was arrested and beaten in jail.
He has long been an advocate of the Western-style solutions to
economic turmoil _ more openness, more freedom _ and the protest
movement against Mahathir only surfaced once he was in jail. Gore
leapt on that opportunity _ particularly striking because, in the
case of Indonesia earlier this year, it took the administration
months to come to the conclusion that President Suharto had to go.
He went.

   The fear now is that the public U.S. embrace of the nascent
opposition in Malaysia could bolster Mahathir's standing. After
all, he is a nationalist, and now he has evidence that the
Americans want to see him toppled. It's not a far stretch for him
to argue that Clinton _ who snubbed his country by skipping the
summit at the last minute _ is using currency traders the way
President Lyndon B. Johnson used Marines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore gave Mahathir the excuse to portray himself as a man
fighting for independence from the Americans,'' a senior Clinton
administration official said, arguing that the vice president went
too far. ``We've just taken a bad situation and made it worse.''
</P>
<P>
   But for a man who is already running for president, standing up
to an Asian authoritarian can't be an entirely unwise move. The
risk is one of unintended consequences. It is easy to explain to
the world why you are simply going after brutal tyrants like Saddam
or drug runners and money launderers.
</P>
<P>
   But siding with ``reformers'' is trickier business. Clinton did
exactly that in Japan in 1993, abandoning decades of covert support
for Japan's conservative ruling party. By the time the reformers
were finished with the Japanese economy, Washington was begging for
the old-timers to come back.

SPORTS COLUMN: OUTFIELDER BECOMES COLLEGE VALEDICTORIAN  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He was known as Tito Landrum back in the '80s. He
stood in against Nolan Ryan and Doc Gooden when their fastballs
buzzed under his chin, but he never knew fear until he sat in a
classroom at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kids were more qualified than me,'' he said the other
day, a college graduate, a man with a future. ``There would be a
three-hour class and a half-hour break and another three-hour
class. I did not know how to handle it. I was out of the loop.''
</P>
<P>
   He is now called Terry Landrum, his given name. Last May he was
valedictorian of his college class, the School of Education at NYU,
after being chosen by his peers. ``I had a problem with that,'' he
said. ``Some of them had 3.9 averages, and mine was only 3.3. But
they wanted me to do it, and it was an honor.''
</P>
<P>
   With his B.S. in physical therapy, Terry Landrum will have a
life after sports. Not all athletes make the break, and some of
them run into very public trouble. Too gracious to bring up the
subject himself, Landrum conceded that some of his colleagues still
seem to be grieving for their former life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to some of the golf tournaments and card shows,'' he
said. ``I ask them, `What are you doing?' and they say, `Oh,
nothing.' You'd be amazed at some of them. Where are they now?''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, many athletes do not live in the past, but shed their
clubhouse manners and life style when it is time, and become useful
members of the broader society.
</P>
<P>
   There is the former professional running back and Supreme Court
Justice, Byron White, once known as Whizzer. There is Sally Ride,
former junior tennis player, rugby player at Stanford, later an
astronaut. There is Scotty Baesler, a former basketball captain for
the University of Kentucky, losing a tight election to Jim Bunning,
a pitcher of a perfect game, for a Senate seat. There are Bill
Bradley and Steve Largent and that former minor league outfielder,
Mario Cuomo. There are Tenley Albright, Bobby Brown, Eric Heiden,
Dot Richardson, Ron Taylor and Debi Thomas, doctors all.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on your definition of athlete, there is also Jesse
(the Body) Ventura, the professional wrestler who seems to have
learned a thing or two from being slammed to the mat, scripted or
spontaneous.
</P>
<P>
   Upon beating two professional pols this month for the
governorship of Minnesota, Ventura said, ``You can't win until you
learn how to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Tito Landrum knew he was learning lessons while taking eight
years to reach the St. Louis Cardinals, with the Van Slykes and
McGees and Colemans ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not an everyday player, so I had to go early for
practice,'' Terry Landrum said last week. ``I would stay late and
listen to everybody. I accepted criticism. That was the only way to
learn.''
</P>
<P>
   He had his moments. In 1983, he was shuttled to Baltimore, and
he hit the homer in Chicago that won the American League series. In
1985, when Vince Coleman absent-mindedly became entangled in the
tarpaulin, Landrum stepped in and batted .429 in the league series
and .360 in the World Series, and relished every moment of it.
</P>
<P>
   He was, for the record, one of the good people in a major league
clubhouse, willing to express himself, while many of his Cardinal
teammates were grumbling about all those journalists asking all
those questions.
</P>
<P>
   When his career ended in 1989, Tito Landrum tried for a job in
baseball, and none was forthcoming, if you can imagine that. In
1991, he moved to New York with his fiancee, Carol Williams, an
award-winning producer now with ABC's ``Discovery'' series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carol is my heart and soul,'' he said. ``We've been together
11 years. When she suggested I go back to school, I was frightened
because I had been an average student in high school, and had no
background in science or math, all the things I hated and, quite
honestly, ducked. But I took one course in biology and got a B, and
that excited me.''
</P>
<P>
   He had not made a ton of money in baseball, and wound up taking
a student loan after seeking guidance from Richard Lapchick of the
Northeastern University Center for the Study of Sports in Society.
</P>
<P>
   Accepted into the highly selective physical therapy program at
NYU, Landrum felt like a rookie who has just seen his first
big-time curveball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing I had was my work ethic,'' he said. ``I showed
up early, and I asked questions. I had four tutors, and I would sit
and talk with those bright kids about how to study.''
</P>
<P>
   Last May 13, in his elegant speaking voice, Terry Landrum gave
his valedictory talk, a masterpiece in six quick paragraphs. He
recalled a minister's parable about a race in which the two fastest
runners became careless and fell down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always identified with the slowest runner,'' Landrum
said. ``I spent eight long years in the minors. Then I made it to
three World Series. Not one of them felt as good as it feels to be
here today.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Landrum has completed eight-week clinical
internships, one in cardiopulmonary medicine, one in orthopedics,
and is now studying to gain his license. He hopes to specialize in
female athletes who are coming down with a major number of
noncontact knee injuries.
</P>
<P>
   He would have been an asset for any baseball team in the front
office, or with a television network. Instead, Terry Landrum has
applied the positive values from sport toward his own education and
a useful career in the broader world.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget E.F. Hutton. These days, when the markets speak,
everyone, even Alan Greenspan, listens.
</P>
<P>
   That's the message from the Federal Reserve Board's decision
last week to cut interest rates for the third time in seven weeks.
The reason for the rate reductions was not a slowdown in the
domestic economy, which is typically behind a rate cut. Rather the
moves were an attempt to eliminate ongoing problems in the
international bond markets that first surfaced in August when
Russia defaulted on its debt.
</P>
<P>
   A perhaps unintended consequence of the Fed's moves is a stock
market that has gone up, up and away. In about a month, the Dow
Jones industrial average has risen more than 1,000 points. This
recovery, from the depths of August's despair, is impressive
indeed. Compare it, for example, with how stocks acted after the
Crash of 1987. Then, according to Peter Canelo, an equity
strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, it took 15 months for
stocks to recover half of what they lost. This year, it took less
than one month.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, many of the world's economic woes that caused the
market to go down remain as troubling now as they were two months
ago. Most of Asia continues in deep recession, the success of the
Brazilian bailout is unclear and earnings at corporations in this
country are falling. Many economists think prospects for economic
growth next year are tepid at best.
</P>
<P>
   And so the market is made up of two voices: one that votes with
its funds, another that worries over the economic data. The gulf
between these two is wider than it has been in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Those putting their money into stocks are saying that there will
be no recession in 1999 and that corporate profit growth next year
will not be as disappointing as pessimistic economists predict.
</P>
<P>
   Part of their optimism is based on lower interest rates, which
mean less onerous borrowing costs for corporations. Bond prices
typically also rise when the Fed cuts rates because the new lower
prevailing rate of interest paid on debt securities makes those
bonds issued previously and at higher rates more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   But three interest rate cuts, a balm to both economy and
consumer, cannot explain all of the stock market's feverish
movement. The rocketing stock market seems to be increasingly
unconnected to economic reality.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that investors are behaving irrationally.
Since the market is thousands of individuals making discrete
investment decisions with cold, hard cash each day, the market
actually tends to see the future better than the economists and
market strategists who pop up on television and in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   No one yet knows, of course, whether the market or the
pessimistic pundits will win out next year. What is knowable is
which voice is being heeded more these days. It is the voice of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   How do you search for clues about the nation's economic future?
Historically, analysts scrutinized the government's releases of
economic data to decide on an investment path. Now people are
looking at the market to see which path to take, buying stocks
simply because they are going up. More than one Wall Street
strategist says that since the market is very good at seeing
recessions on the horizon, rising stock prices mean there will be
no such thing in 1999. If the market saw a recession looming, stock
prices would not be rising, according to this argument.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Fed chairman seems riveted on the markets, not on
economic arcana such as, say, the U.S. international price index
for in-bound ocean line freight. His three recent rate cuts have
been strictly the result of disturbing patterns in the bond market.
</P>
<P>
   Investors used to watch the Fed to help them make their
investment decisions. Now the Fed analyzes investors to help it set
monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that the Fed no longer considers economic
data, of course. And part of the central bank's increased focus on
the bond market is the Fed's quite fitting response to the
increasing significance of the bond and stock markets. As more and
more individual investors put their savings into stocks, for
example, the performance of the stock market becomes more of a
predictor of consumer buying patterns. Since the American consumer
accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economy, a surging stock
market and its resulting wealth creation, has a big effect on
businesses everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also something strangely circular in this focus on
the financial markets. As investors and policy-makers look
increasingly to the markets for wisdom, it becomes the investment
equivalent of looking at dancers looking at themselves in the
mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost our anchor,'' said Stan Jonas, managing director of
Fimat U.S.A., a brokerage in New York that specializes in futures
and derivatives. ``We used to have some idea and take a bit of news
and say it means that the Fed is more or less likely to do
something. But now it's not the fundamentals, it's what other
people think about the fundamentals that are important.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the market isn't wise. It is, because the market is, at
any given time, the sum of investors' current knowledge of the
facts that influence investing decisions. But it is not omniscient;
sometimes, investors don't have all the facts they need to make an
informed decision.
</P>
<P>
   But facts are becoming less important to the increasing numbers
of investors who buy stocks. After years of a roaring bull market,
many players are short term oriented in their trading, investing
based on what they think valuations of stocks and bonds will be
next month or even next week; the objective is less about long-term
investing than it is about investing to outwit the masses. A
dangerous thing.
</P>
<P>
   Behavior like this is as old as human nature. John Maynard
Keynes discussed it in his 1936 book, ``The General Theory of
Employment Interest and Money.'' To Keynes, ``professional
investment may be likened to newspaper competitions in which
competitors have to pick out the six prettiest faces from a hundred
photographs, the prize being awarded to the competitor whose choice
most nearly corresponds to the average preferences of the
competitors as a whole.'' What inevitably happens, he wrote, is
``each competitor picks not those faces which he himself finds
prettiest, but those which he thinks likeliest to catch the fancy
of the other competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   In the context of today's market, Keynes' observation translates
to: What counts is not what we think about the future of the
economy or the stock market but what we think most people think
about the future of the economy or the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent investment conference in New York City sponsored by
Grant's Interest Rate Observer, one of the speakers was Steven
Leuthold, a respected stock market analyst known for relying on
hard facts and historical data to draw his conclusions on market
strategy. Leuthold had been bearish recently, pointing to a raft of
figures that put the stock market at overvalued levels. Yet
Leuthold said he had become bullish about stocks and felt that the
Dow would pierce the 10,000 level within months.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for his change of heart? The biggest indicator of
all: the crowd. Main Street is in love with stocks, he said, and
this made higher stock prices a given.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't beat them, get in line.

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget E.F. Hutton. These days, when the markets speak,
everyone, even Alan Greenspan, listens.
</P>
<P>
   That's the message from the Federal Reserve Board's decision
last week to cut interest rates for the third time in seven weeks.
The reason for the rate reductions was not a slowdown in the
domestic economy, which is typically behind a rate cut. Rather the
moves were an attempt to eliminate ongoing problems in the
international bond markets that first surfaced in August when
Russia defaulted on its debt.
</P>
<P>
   A perhaps unintended consequence of the Fed's moves is a stock
market that has gone up, up and away. In about a month, the Dow
Jones industrial average has risen more than 1,000 points. This
recovery, from the depths of August's despair, is impressive
indeed. Compare it, for example, with how stocks acted after the
Crash of 1987. Then, according to Peter Canelo, an equity
strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, it took 15 months for
stocks to recover half of what they lost. This year, it took less
than one month.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, many of the world's economic woes that caused the
market to go down remain as troubling now as they were two months
ago. Most of Asia continues in deep recession, the success of the
Brazilian bailout is unclear and earnings at corporations in this
country are falling. Many economists think prospects for economic
growth next year are tepid at best.
</P>
<P>
   And so the market is made up of two voices: one that votes with
its funds, another that worries over the economic data. The gulf
between these two is wider than it has been in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Those putting their money into stocks are saying that there will
be no recession in 1999 and that corporate profit growth next year
will not be as disappointing as pessimistic economists predict.
</P>
<P>
   Part of their optimism is based on lower interest rates, which
mean less onerous borrowing costs for corporations. Bond prices
typically also rise when the Fed cuts rates because the new lower
prevailing rate of interest paid on debt securities makes those
bonds issued previously and at higher rates more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   But three interest rate cuts, a balm to both economy and
consumer, cannot explain all of the stock market's feverish
movement. The rocketing stock market seems to be increasingly
unconnected to economic reality.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that investors are behaving irrationally.
Since the market is thousands of individuals making discrete
investment decisions with cold, hard cash each day, the market
actually tends to see the future better than the economists and
market strategists who pop up on television and in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   No one yet knows, of course, whether the market or the
pessimistic pundits will win out next year. What is knowable is
which voice is being heeded more these days. It is the voice of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   How do you search for clues about the nation's economic future?
Historically, analysts scrutinized the government's releases of

COMMENTARY: MY EXIT STRATEGY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was many, many, many hours into the dullest day
in Washington history.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Starr was giving that spooky smile of his and droning on
with starchy phrases like ``possible potential offenses,'' ``at a
fairly high level of generality,'' ``not in a person-specific way''
and, of course, his irritating tag for almost every observation,
``and the like.''
</P>
<P>
   Detailing his endless, fruitless pursuit of Bill Clinton, he was
like a prissy Elmer Fudd.  &UR; I'll get that siwwy wabbit . . . and the
wike! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One could only hope that Maxine Waters, the gentle lady from
California, would completely lose it and lunge for the prosecutor's
neck.
</P>
<P>
   This pathetic scandal is like one of those unfunny ``Saturday
Night Live'' skits that go on too long and get painful to watch.
</P>
<P>
   The players are no longer thinking impeachment; they're just
scrambling to save their credibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Flummoxed Henry Hyde was flailing to keep alive the myth of
the Judicious Henry Hyde, as he is routinely described. As Starr
was spinning and grinning, Sam Dash was making a mad dash. Monica
was holed up in L.A., watching her griller on the grill and
preparing to spin and sob on TV with Barbara Walters and in print
with Princess Di's biographer. The wacky right-wing blondes who
hope to give conservatism legs and the Clinton apologists were
still throwing food at each other on cable, but who could stomach
it?
</P>
<P>
   We need an exit strategy. I have one.
</P>
<P>
   We must suspend disbelief, and cynicism, and give every single
unappetizing character in this morality play the benefit of the
doubt. They are all shy, enigmatic, cruelly misunderstood
creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton: OK, he was just mentoring her. He threw her across
the desk and mentored her 'till dawn, as Michael Kinsley once wrote
about another office romance. Besides, this most pastoral of
presidents was really only ministering to a troubled young soul in
his flock. Besides, he was under a lot of pressure from the rabid
pursuit of Independent Counsel Javert and needed an outlet real
bad. Besides, he didn't really lie under oath because the sex was
too lame to count. Besides, he couldn't tell the truth because it
would hurt his wife and daughter. Besides, it is none of our
business. Besides, it depends on what the definition of ``is'' is.
Besides, the stock market's zooming up again.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr, Esquire: The counselor wasn't sex-crazed. He was
just a lawyer in love with the law, the blind mistress with scales
who sang a siren song and lured him deeper and deeper into
investigating the romance between the president and the intern. He
did not have any animus toward Clinton. For Pete's sake, he let him
off the hook (OK, so it was after the election) on Travelgate and
Filegate and might yet let him off the hook on Whitewater. It
wasn't an obsession because he was hardly even involved in that
four-year, $40 million marathon. He revealed at the hearing that he
didn't attend any of the grand-jury questioning or depositions and
did not even bother to meet Monica. His goons only manhandled
Monica's mother, interrogated a schoolchild, investigated a
witness' adoption of a foreign child and held Monica hostage at a
shopping mall in pursuit of almighty facts. Monica's 10 hours in
mall custody were a nice little ``sojourn'' for her, as David
Kendall put it, and Monica was still able to shop and visit the
food court under FBI supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky: She was only trying to adjust her thong
underwear, not flash it. She really did have some fresh ideas on
education reform. The Big Creep just wasn't listening.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans: They only meant to give the president a good
scare, not drive him from office. They always understood it would
be the height of hypocrisy to lynch the president for an office
romance given the fact that so many members of Congress fool around
with their own nubile aides and shed their first wives to marry
babes who work in their offices.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats: Never mind the president's perjury and
obstruction of justice and witness tampering and abuse of power.
Parliamentary procedure was at stake _ not to mention Kendall's
shot at prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Tripp: She really needed to tape her best friend, a
vulnerable young woman in need of guidance, because _ oh good Lord,
forget it. This one is indefensible.

<P>
   Don't gasp, but bureaucrats are rolling out the welcome mats at
some of the nation's welfare offices again.
</P>
<P>
   They are beckoning the working poor and courting the thousands
of single mothers abandoning the welfare rolls. And the message to
those struggling to survive without government checks? ``Don't
forget to apply for Medicaid and food stamps!''
</P>
<P>
   This touting of public charity may seem startling, even
contradictory, at a time when government officials are pushing
work, not welfare. But food stamps and Medicaid are considered
vital entitlements that keep working people off welfare and the
newly employed from slipping back on. And when federal officials
noticed a surprising dip in the number of food stamp recipients
earlier this year, they prodded states to act.
</P>
<P>
   In a flurry of recent memos, federal officials told states to
conduct ``aggressive outreach'' and regional officers to crack down
on wayward localities. The fear is that local governments may be
blocking access to food stamps and Medicaid as they persuade people
to give up the dole, snatching a valuable crutch from welfare
mothers hobbling toward self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
   New York City, for instance, drew intense scrutiny earlier this
month with its practice of delaying Medicaid and food stamp
applications until a second visit to the welfare office. (Federal
law requires them to be supplied without delay.)
</P>
<P>
   But officials in some states are also wringing their hands over
computers that sometimes improperly terminate food stamps and
Medicaid benefits. And federal officials want to clear the clouds
of confusion in poor communities where some believe that ending
old-style welfare means an end to all government assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the federal government's urgings _ coupled with local
concerns for the poor _ have persuaded some states to do the
unthinkable: vigorously hawk public aid. Maryland, where colorful
brochures about Medicaid and food stamps are stacked in its welfare
waiting rooms, now plans to mail that information to the 2,500
single mothers who leave the welfare rolls each month.
</P>
<P>
   South Dakota has sent hundreds of letters to food stamp
recipients to make sure they know about Medicaid. And in Wisconsin,
which has stationed Medicaid and food stamp workers in some
hospitals, Milwaukee is considering revamping its application
process altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of meeting first with workers who discourage
applications for welfare, clients in Milwaukee may soon stop first
at the desks of officials who will discuss their rights to food
stamps and Medicaid, a shift sought by advocates for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're learning that you need to let people know they're
eligible,'' said Jean Rogers, an administrator at Wisconsin's
Department of Workforce Development. ``Both of these issues speak
to being able to hold a job,'' she said. ``If you're sick, you
can't hold down a job. If you're hungry the same applies.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone has joined the rush to embrace food stamps,
which are financed entirely by the federal government, and
Medicaid, which is partly financed by the federal government. Some
local officials are still ambivalent, particularly about pushing
food stamps, a benefit tainted, to some, by welfare's sour smell of
failure.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have taken pains to distinguish between the
two. By law, municipalities can discourage people from applying for
welfare. Food stamps and Medicaid, however, are still federal
entitlements and applications must be offered without delay.
</P>
<P>
   But for some officials, the dividing line is still blurry.
Texas, for instance, gives awards to welfare offices that
discourage the largest numbers of people from applying for welfare
and food stamps. (State officials say they are now reconsidering
the reward for food stamps.)
</P>
<P>
   And in New York City, where applications are generally offered
only on a second visit, officials protest that offering easier
access to food stamps and Medicaid would damage their efforts to
destroy the culture of dependency in poor neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some states have not bought in at a philosophical level that
they should make sure people get food stamps and Medicaid,'' said
Liz Schott, an analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities, a nonprofit research group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, it's not intentional,'' said Ms. Schott, who
has studied the issue. ``It's not that they don't want people to
get food stamps or Medicaid. But this zeal to reduce the welfare
caseloads hasn't been separated from food stamps and Medicaid.''
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns bubbled up earlier this year when advocates for
the poor began noticing that the number of food stamp recipients
had fallen by 25 percent since 1996, the year the new welfare law
was signed, a decline that federal officials say cannot be
explained by the improved economy. (Comparable Medicaid statistics
are not yet available. In New York, declines in Medicaid and food
stamps have been similar.)
</P>
<P>
   At first, some officials thought people were finding jobs and no
longer needed food stamps, said Julie Paradis, an undersecretary at
the Department of Agriculture. But a closer look at the statistics
_ and conversations with advocates for the poor _ convinced federal
officials that many people were simply struggling without benefits,
she said. Most local officials now believe the downward trend must
be slowed, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Those officials are now reaching out to applicants who are
confused by the new law or were deterred by overzealous welfare
workers, and to applicants and to those who are simply too ashamed
to admit they still need help after finding low-wage work.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to attract people too proud to apply for Medicaid because
they associate it with the stigma of welfare, South Dakota even
took the word ``Medicaid'' off the covers of its promotional
brochures, replacing it with the words ``medical help.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really heartened by their commitment,'' said Ms. Paradis.
``They really view the programs as something that should be
available to families.''

waiting rooms, now plans to mail that information to the 2,500
single mothers who leave the welfare rolls each month.
</P>
<P>
   South Dakota has sent hundreds of letters to food stamp
recipients to make sure they know about Medicaid. And in Wisconsin,
which has stationed Medicaid and food stamp workers in some
hospitals, Milwaukee is considering revamping its application
process altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of meeting first with workers who discourage
applications for welfare, clients in Milwaukee may soon stop first
at the desks of officials who will discuss their rights to food
stamps and Medicaid, a shift sought by advocates for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're learning that you need to let people know they're
eligible,'' said Jean Rogers, an administrator at Wisconsin's
Department of Workforce Development. ``Both of these issues speak
to being able to hold a job,'' she said. ``If you're sick, you
can't hold down a job. If you're hungry the same applies.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone has joined the rush to embrace food stamps,
which are financed entirely by the federal government, and
Medicaid, which is partly financed by the federal government. Some
local officials are still ambivalent, particularly about pushing
food stamps, a benefit tainted, to some, by welfare's sour smell of
failure.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have taken pains to distinguish between the
two. By law, municipalities can discourage people from applying for
welfare. Food stamps and Medicaid, however, are still federal
entitlements and applications must be offered without delay.
</P>
<P>
   But for some officials, the dividing line is still blurry.
Texas, for instance, gives awards to welfare offices that
discourage the largest numbers of people from applying for welfare
and food stamps. (State officials say they are now reconsidering
the reward for food stamps.)
</P>
<P>
   And in New York City, where applications are generally offered
only on a second visit, officials protest that offering easier
access to food stamps and Medicaid would damage their efforts to
destroy the culture of dependency in poor neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some states have not bought in at a philosophical level that
they should make sure people get food stamps and Medicaid,'' said
Liz Schott, an analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities, a nonprofit research group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, it's not intentional,'' said Ms. Schott, who
has studied the issue. ``It's not that they don't want people to
get food stamps or Medicaid. But this zeal to reduce the welfare
caseloads hasn't been separated from food stamps and Medicaid.''
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns bubbled up earlier this year when advocates for
the poor began noticing that the number of food stamp recipients
had fallen by 25 percent since 1996, the year the new welfare law
was signed, a decline that federal officials say cannot be
explained by the improved economy. (Comparable Medicaid statistics
are not yet available. In New York, declines in Medicaid and food
stamps have been similar.)
</P>
<P>
   At first, some officials thought people were finding jobs and no
longer needed food stamps, said Julie Paradis, an undersecretary at
the Department of Agriculture. But a closer look at the statistics
_ and conversations with advocates for the poor _ convinced federal
officials that many people were simply struggling without benefits,
she said. Most local officials now believe the downward trend must
be slowed, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Those officials are now reaching out to applicants who are
confused by the new law or were deterred by overzealous welfare
workers, and to applicants and to those who are simply too ashamed
to admit they still need help after finding low-wage work.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to attract people too proud to apply for Medicaid because
they associate it with the stigma of welfare, South Dakota even
took the word ``Medicaid'' off the covers of its promotional
brochures, replacing it with the words ``medical help.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really heartened by their commitment,'' said Ms. Paradis.
``They really view the programs as something that should be
available to families.''

COMMENTARY: WITHOUT EVIDENCE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Texas)   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The prosecutors who brought homicide charges against 11-year-old
Lacresha Murray for allegedly killing a 2{-year-old girl now
concede that Lacresha's so-called confession, obtained during a
lengthy grilling by the police in Austin, Texas, was worthless.
</P>
<P>
   ``She never confessed to anything,'' said Gary Cobb, an
assistant district attorney in Travis County who was the lead
prosecutor in the case. ``She said she may have accidentally
dropped and accidentally kicked the child, which is totally
inconsistent with the injury. So that played no part in what we did
with the case.''
</P>
<P>
   (Cobb may have forgotten, but it certainly did play a part. Over
the objections of the defense, Cobb's team fought successfully to
have Lacresha's signed statement introduced at her trial.)
</P>
<P>
   Lacresha, now 14, is serving a 25-year sentence for the fatal
beating of Jayla Belton in May 1996. There was no forensic evidence
linking her to the crime, nor were there any witnesses alleging
that she attacked the child.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews last week I asked Cobb and his boss, the Travis
County district attorney, Ronnie Earle, what evidence had convinced
them that Lacresha was the killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great deal of evidence that taken all together is
what points to her,'' said Cobb. He said Lacresha had the
``opportunity'' to kill the child because she had ``access'' to the
room Jayla was in at approximately the time of death, ``or at least
the time that the child started dying.''
</P>
<P>
   When I asked what Lacresha had specifically done to Jayla, both
Cobb and Earle said they believed she had stomped on her. And given
the number of injuries, said Cobb, it was clear that ``she did
something else to her.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked what that might have been. Cobb said: ``Well, she could
have hit her with her fist. She could have hit her up against
something. She could have kicked her more.''
</P>
<P>
   I said, ``But you don't know whether she did or not?''
</P>
<P>
   Cobb replied, presumably sarcastically, ``We don't have a
videotape of her doing anything.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked several more times about the apparent lack of evidence
against Lacresha.
</P>
<P>
   Earle said, ``This is a child murder, a baby murder. Almost all
murders of infants, of children, happen when just two people are
present _ the killer and the decedent. So there is almost never any
evidence of any kind.''
</P>
<P>
   He then said there  &UR; was &LR;  evidence in this case and it ``all
points to Lacresha.''
</P>
<P>
   There were two trials, one in the summer of 1996 and another in
February 1997, each resulting in a guilty verdict. The first
verdict was thrown out. In that case, the prosecution theorized
that Lacresha's grandfather, R.L. Murray, had been mistaken when he
said he had heard Lacresha bouncing a ball in the house on the
afternoon in question. The prosecutors said that what he heard was
not a bouncing ball, but Lacresha slamming Jayla against the walls
of a room less than a dozen feet from where Murray was sitting.
</P>
<P>
   That theory was abandoned in the second trial. The new theory,
never mentioned at the first trial, was that Lacresha had stomped
on Jayla and that one of her tennis shoes had left an impression on
the child's chest.
</P>
<P>
   That theory, in the view of Earle and Cobb, is still viable.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb told me last week, ``We do have a footprint that matches a
shoe belonging to Lacresha that we were able to match as leaving a
skin impression on the child.''
</P>
<P>
   Earle described that as ``fairly powerful evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the men mentioned why such ``powerful'' evidence had
not been introduced at the first trial. It turns out that the
alleged match was bogus, even though it was presented to the second
jury as ``evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   As the second trial was approaching, the DA's office put
together photos of marks on Jayla's body with photos of a pair of
sneakers found in the Murray home. They turned the photos over to
the state crime lab, hoping, apparently in desperation, to have a
match declared.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter dated Feb. 5, 1997, Juan Rojas, an official with the
crime lab, informed the prosecution team that ``we were unable to
testify that the marks on Belton's body were made by these shoes
due to insufficient general characteristics.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, no match.
</P>
<P>
   The jury was never told of that letter.
</P>

<P>
   Who doesn't remember feeling an electrifying zing up the spine
at that majestic blast of trumpets and the ``Star Wars'' title
appearing on the big screen for the first time? With innovative
special effects and a classic good-vs.-evil theme, the ``Star
Wars'' series became a part of pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Star Wars'' enthusiasts, the hottest film shown last week
had its sneak preview announced on the Internet and sent a small
army of fans into theaters around the country to watch it over and
over again.
</P>
<P>
   The Zing strikes back.
</P>
<P>
   That was the response to the two-minute trailer _ just the
preview, mind you _ for ``The Phantom Menace,'' George Lucas'
latest installment in what is being billed as a prequel to the
``Star Wars'' trilogy. The actual film is due in theaters on May
21, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The first ``Star Wars'' trailer also began showing months before
the film's release in May 1977, but after reports of audiences
booing and laughing, the film's distributor, 20th Century Fox,
quailed and yanked it out of circulation.
</P>
<P>
   It was a completely different scene Tuesday night at the sneak
preview of the preview in a downtown Manhattan theater. (Its
official opening date was Friday, but the movie's Web site,
www.starwars.com, announced advance screenings at selected
theaters.) The lights went dark, and unlike the typical New York
movie experience, the audience instantly shut up. The crowd seemed
to be holding its breath as scenes from ``The Phantom Menace''
thundered onto the screen in a flurry of spaceships, aliens, robots
and humanoids, all new but vaguely familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Set a generation before the original ``Star Wars'' movie,
Episode I follows a youthful Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker,
the boy who is destined to become Darth Vader. The cast includes
Liam Neesom, Natalie Portman and Samuel L. Jackson, among others.
To see the preview, fans still had to pay $9, the price of
admission at most New York City theaters.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the trailer ended and the one for the remake of
``Psycho'' began, about 30 people ran to the theater next door to
catch the ``Phantom Menace'' preview again as it began to play
after the closing credits of ``Meet Joe Black.'' Ushers discreetly
looked the other way as the trailer was being trailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here since 10 a.m.,'' said Chris Bergoch, a
26-year-old diehard ``Star Wars'' fan who took the day off from
work and spent it ducking in and out of three screening rooms
showing the trailer. By 8 p.m., he'd seen it 20 times and was
planning to spend the rest of the night there. ``I've waited 16
years for this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another all-day viewer was Jude Lane, who was only 3 when ``Star
Wars'' came out and says it was her first memory. ``No matter what
the color, race, background or religion of the people watching the
trailer, for two minutes and five seconds everyone feels the
same,'' she said. ``You're friends with everybody in the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   The renewed buzz about ``Star Wars'' has been building since
last year's re-release of the trilogy, which incorporated new
footage and state-of-the-art digital effects. The movies offered
nostalgia for viewers, and some of them brought their own children
to experience the movies on the big screen, and not slice-and-dice
versions on television. Generation X, who once nagged Mom for those
little $1.49 Luke Skywalker action figures, can today choose from
vast array of toys including videos, games, books and a $29.95
CD-ROM titled ``Behind the Magic,'' which serves as a guide to the
``Star Wars'' universe and offers a glimpse of ``The Phantom
Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   But by May all the hype _ from merchandise to advertising _
might work to turn off an already cynical public. ``There are
concerns, certainly in the wake of `Godzilla,''' said Andrew
Hindes, a senior writer at Variety. ``Fox knows they don't have to
overhype this. You can't have more awareness. If they're smart,
they'll be subtle. You could open it cold and it would still be
huge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Godzilla'' cost Sony Pictures Entertainment $200 million to
make and market globally, but will result in little if any profit.
So far, the original ``Star Wars'' trilogy has made at least $1.7
billion. ``The Phantom Menace,'' the first in another Lucasfilm
trilogy, cost $115 million to make.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows if the hype will overshadow ``The Phantom Menace''
itself. If Lucas has stuck with his original vision of the saga,
which was of a simple, feel-good action series full of universal
themes, it might not. Deep down, past all the special effects and
whiz-bang glitz, the director is conjuring with some fundamental
elements of mankind.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Star Wars' is not a simple morality play,'' the late Joseph
Campbell, an authority on mythology, wrote. ``It has to do with the
powers of life as they are either fulfilled or broken and
suppressed through the action of man.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe with this newest episode, the marketing team will resist
the temptation to paste hundreds of posters saying ``Yoda is THIS
tall'' on the sides of street-corner newspaper boxes. If there's a
film that doesn't need too much hype, it would be ``The Phantom
Menace,'' and face it, the Force is already with them.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking for a role model for your career? How about Jesse
Ventura, the menacing wrestler turned blustery radio host turned
straight-talking Minnesota governor-elect?
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's election this month may have seemed simply a golden
moment in political eccentricity. But if you wade through the
bulging bookshelf of tomes on the changing nature of careers in
America, Ventura looks like something else as well _ a poster boy
for the new post-downsizing, information-age ethos of creative
reinvention that various deep thinkers trumpet as the new norm in
the American workplace.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there are striking changes in the economy, psychology
and demography of the country that make Ventura's unlikely path _
and the lure of inspired amateurism _ particularly illustrative.
But how new the ethos of reinvention is, whether it is a trend to
be welcomed or feared and how committed Americans are to it are all
questions worth pondering.
</P>
<P>
   As if taken from books with titles like, ``Career Intelligence:
the 12 New Rules for Work and Life Success,'' Ventura's career
seems crafted from the jargon of the career counseling class: He
sees his career as a lattice, not a ladder. He communicates in
persuasive yet unconventional ways. He thinks about roles, not
jobs, cultivates a broad network and keeps on learning. At 47, he
probably has several zigs and zags left.
</P>
<P>
   ``He found a way to take his own authentic self and use it to
reposition himself as a politician,'' said Barbara Moses, head of
BBM Human Resource Consultants of Toronto and the author of
``Career Intelligence'' (Berrett-Koehler, 1998). ``I think of
careers in terms of Legos. You might have a space station, but a
kid takes the space vehicle and uses it at the zoo and then it
becomes an ambulance that takes people to the hospital. The pieces
are reconfigured, but their essential properties have not mutated.
More and more, we do the same thing in our careers.''
</P>
<P>
   F. Scott Fitzgerald once mused that, ``There are no second acts
in American lives.'' It may be one of the least persuasive
aphorisms ever to get wide currency.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have always had second acts. They have been immigrants
beginning anew. They have left behind families and scrawled ``Gone
to Texas'' on the walls of their houses. Second and third marriages
are routine. And even in the most conventional lives, retirees
leave familiar worlds behind for the Florida sun.
</P>
<P>
   What is new is that so many Americans are now having third and
fourth acts, they are having them later in life and several trends
may be making them unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   First is the aging of the population, the dominant demographic
trend as 76 million baby boomers continue to age into vital,
restless seniors. In 1900, life expectancy in the United States was
49. Today it is 76. People who reach age 55 can expect to live into
their 80s, meaning most will either be working longer or
anticipating a retirement more dynamic and challenging than models
from the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   Second is the wave of layoffs and restructurings of the early
1990s. A study by James Medoff, a Harvard economist, found that
workers between the ages of 35 and 54 were 55 percent more likely
to be jobless during the 1990s because of a layoff or job loss than
in the 1970s. The cuts at the nation's biggest companies
obliterated for many the expectation of lifelong employment with a
single employer, and made restructuring and career insecurity a
permanent part of the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the restructurings that kicked some middle
managers into the cold helped stoke a boom in the stock market that
has left unprecedented numbers of workers and managers able to cash
out and pick up new jobs or lives.
</P>
<P>
   Social expectations have changed too. Workers today seem to be
groping for more personal fulfillment than earlier generations did.
The increasing pace of technological change, the vogue for less
rigid corporate structures and perhaps even millennial ferment are
encouraging the shift toward multiple acts. And in a mass-media
environment, it can help to be a former wrestler campaigning
against two dull suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're jaded,'' said Ms. Moses. ``How do you get someone's
attention when they're tired and distracted? If you're new and
fresh, they don't go yawn yawn, blah blah and turn the page.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, all those factors are creating the golden age of
personal reinvention. Entertainers like Sonny Bono and athletes
like Jim Bunning and Steve Largent go to Congress or, like Bill
Bradley, go to Congress and then go on to something else. John
Glenn goes from astronaut to senator to astronaut (a greenhorn the
second time around because of advances in space-flight technology).
Internet gossip hound Matt Drudge irks journalists by serving up
news as well as innuendo in cyberspace. The great entrepreneurial
successes are Steve Jobs in his garage or Bill Gates dropping out
of Harvard to start Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Even when it comes to health, a lot of people, some motivated by
rising costs, seem to prefer newcomers to medicine over old-line
professionals. A recent study in the Journal of the American
Medical Association reported on the astounding growth of
alternative medicine in the United States, with 83 million people
using some form of alternative medicine, up 47 percent over 1990.
</P>
<P>
   A search of recent news articles turns up a chorus of
reinvention _ the artist turned psychotherapist, the accountant
turned winemaker, the 76-year-old, first-time film director. To
some, the message is that the traditional career path is kaput.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old rules have fallen apart,'' said Marti Smye, author of
``Is It Too Late to Run Away and Join the Circus? A Guide for Your
Second Life'' (Macmillan, 1998). ``You talk to senior team members
at top companies and they're all thinking the same thing: What am I
going to do with my next life?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, new paradigms usually have to coexist with old ones.
Ventura probably won only because his two rivals split the rest of
the vote. The fact is that in politics, as in many other fields,
the game is still rigged in favor of the traditional careerists and
insiders over the amateurs and outsiders. And for every risk taker
nimbly skipping from career rock to career rock, there are nervous
middle managers hanging on.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura perhaps represents the glass-half-full aspect of the new
careerism. In a new book, ``Boomernomics'' (Ballantine, 1998),
William Sterling and Stephen Wells posit a future of 10 more
economic boom years and then a debacle as boomers try to sell
investments at the same time and Social Security and Medicare
stagger under the weight of too many aging boomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to have to reinvent themselves at later
stages in life than were ever imaginable in the past,'' said
Sterling, an investment strategist with Credit Suisse Asset
Management. ``We're going to be asking more and more people in
their 50s and even their 60s to make employer and even career
changes at a period in the past when they were thinking about which
retirement community to choose. You get into the
old-dogs-and-new-tricks issue.''

 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking for a role model for your career? How about Jesse
Ventura, the menacing wrestler turned blustery radio host turned
straight-talking Minnesota governor-elect?
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's election this month may have seemed simply a golden
moment in political eccentricity. But if you wade through the
bulging bookshelf of tomes on the changing nature of careers in
America, Ventura looks like something else as well _ a poster boy
for the new post-downsizing, information-age ethos of creative
reinvention that various deep thinkers trumpet as the new norm in
the American workplace.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there are striking changes in the economy, psychology
and demography of the country that make Ventura's unlikely path _
and the lure of inspired amateurism _ particularly illustrative.
But how new the ethos of reinvention is, whether it is a trend to
be welcomed or feared and how committed Americans are to it are all
questions worth pondering.
</P>
<P>
   As if taken from books with titles like, ``Career Intelligence:
the 12 New Rules for Work and Life Success,'' Ventura's career
seems crafted from the jargon of the career counseling class: He
sees his career as a lattice, not a ladder. He communicates in
persuasive yet unconventional ways. He thinks about roles, not
jobs, cultivates a broad network and keeps on learning. At 47, he
probably has several zigs and zags left.
</P>
<P>
   ``He found a way to take his own authentic self and use it to
reposition himself as a politician,'' said Barbara Moses, head of
BBM Human Resource Consultants of Toronto and the author of
``Career Intelligence'' (Berrett-Koehler, 1998). ``I think of
careers in terms of Legos. You might have a space station, but a
kid takes the space vehicle and uses it at the zoo and then it
becomes an ambulance that takes people to the hospital. The pieces
are reconfigured, but their essential properties have not mutated.
More and more, we do the same thing in our careers.''
</P>
<P>
   F. Scott Fitzgerald once mused that, ``There are no second acts
in American lives.'' It may be one of the least persuasive
aphorisms ever to get wide currency.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have always had second acts. They have been immigrants
beginning anew. They have left behind families and scrawled ``Gone
to Texas'' on the walls of their houses. Second and third marriages
are routine. And even in the most conventional lives, retirees
leave familiar worlds behind for the Florida sun.
</P>
<P>
   What is new is that so many Americans are now having third and
fourth acts, they are having them later in life and several trends
may be making them unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   First is the aging of the population, the dominant demographic
trend as 76 million baby boomers continue to age into vital,
restless seniors. In 1900, life expectancy in the United States was
49. Today it is 76. People who reach age 55 can expect to live into
their 80s, meaning most will either be working longer or
anticipating a retirement more dynamic and challenging than models
from the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   Second is the wave of layoffs and restructurings of the early
1990s. A study by James Medoff, a Harvard economist, found that
workers between the ages of 35 and 54 were 55 percent more likely
to be jobless during the 1990s because of a layoff or job loss than
in the 1970s. The cuts at the nation's biggest companies
obliterated for many the expectation of lifelong employment with a
single employer, and made restructuring and career insecurity a
permanent part of the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the restructurings that kicked some middle
managers into the cold helped stoke a boom in the stock market that
has left unprecedented numbers of workers and managers able to cash
out and pick up new jobs or lives.
</P>
<P>
   Social expectations have changed too. Workers today seem to be
groping for more personal fulfillment than earlier generations did.
The increasing pace of technological change, the vogue for less
rigid corporate structures and perhaps even millennial ferment are
encouraging the shift toward multiple acts. And in a mass-media
environment, it can help to be a former wrestler campaigning
against two dull suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're jaded,'' said Ms. Moses. ``How do you get someone's
attention when they're tired and distracted? If you're new and
fresh, they don't go yawn yawn, blah blah and turn the page.''
</P>

<P>
   With thousands of new tools and techniques introduced into
medicine each year, doctors face constant pressure to stay abreast
of technology. And savvy patients shop around for those who will
perform the latest procedures advertised in newspapers or discussed
at dinner parties.
</P>
<P>
   But what most patients don't know as they're wheeled into the
operating room is how skilled their doctors are with the new
equipment. The physicians using it, sometimes for the first time,
may have taken only a three-hour course or watched a video or
chatted with the manufacturer's sales representative.
</P>
<P>
   Or they may lack any training, which was the case last year when
two doctors at New York's Beth Israel Medical Center operated on a
30-year-old woman to remove fibroid tumors from her uterus. The
woman, Lisa Smart, died of cardiac arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Last week her husband, Anderson, asked that criminal charges be
filed against her doctors, Robert Klinger and Marc Sklar, and David
Myers, a salesman for Johnson &AMP; Johnson, which manufactured the
equipment involved. A New York state Health Department report said
that Myers operated the equipment, and the New York state Education
Department, which licenses doctors, found evidence that his
activities amounted to practicing medicine without a license. The
Education Department has recommended that Myers be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   The case has prompted many hospitals around the country to
examine their policies on continuing education for doctors. But it
is not the first time mastery of new medical technology has been
questioned.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s seven patients in New York died and 151 were
injured during gall bladder surgery because their doctors were
inadequately trained in using a laparoscope. One doctor had
received no formal instruction; others one- or two-day seminars.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Education Department and the American Medical
Association have each developed guidelines recommending that
doctors take courses on new equipment and procedures and that they
demonstrate proficiency under the supervision of more experienced
doctors before they operate alone.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines, however, are not legal requirements. Hospitals
and surgical clinic set their own standards. Dr. Randolph Smoak,
chairman of the AMA board, said the rules of most organizations are
not as strict as the association's. Other doctors agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect that if you're practicing in a remote area in a
small department, it could be difficult to keep up with new
technology and establish standards,'' said Dr. Frederic Frigoletto,
chairman of obstetrics at Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not restricted to remote places, said an
orthopedic surgeon at a New York hospital who asked not to be
identified. ``I'm not sure that teaching hospitals necessarily have
a better reputation for physician training than clinics or
community hospitals,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, there are probably
doctors who do cases that are beyond their capability and
expertise. And there are probably doctors who rely on sales reps
more than they should for training.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most startling detail from the Beth Israel incident
is that a salesman was in the operating room. In fact, salesmen
attend operations routinely, usually at the request of doctors
using new devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an accepted and acceptable practice to have service reps
there to provide information when there's new equipment,'' said
Susan Waltman, senior vice president and general counsel for the
Greater New York Hospital Association; she compared the presence of
a sales representative in surgery to that of a computer technician
in the office. The representatives receive thorough training in the
equipment they sell, she said, often by doctors. Every hospital has
a different policy on what the salesman can do, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, the individual must be outside the surgical field
and not touching the patient,'' she said, but the salesman might be
allowed to operate the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than once I've seen a salesman say, `Doctor, I wouldn't
start the machine that high,''' said Dr. Martin Weisberg, clinical
associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Thomas
Jefferson University in Philadelphia. ``The salesman might say that
it's not safe to go above 50, or that it's OK to go to 60.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoak, a surgeon, said he has seen representatives instruct
surgeons on inserting pacemakers. ``Occasionally, if we're having a
little trouble getting a pacemaker to maintain its position, a
salesman may suggest something that's worked elsewhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors do not tell patients when a salesman will be present
during their surgery. The New York state Health Department wants to
change that. ``Obviously, this is an infringement of privacy,''
said Frances Tarlton, a department spokeswoman. The department will
soon send a statement to hospitals directing them to inform
patients if a salesman is present, as well as which procedure will
be done and by which health professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important for surgeons to discuss these things
with patients so that they can accept or reject the procedure,''
Smoak said. If doctors are not forthcoming, he urges patients to
keep asking questions.

CLINTON AND SOUTH KOREA OFFER CARROT AND STICK TO NORTH KOREA

<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ President Clinton and South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung tried to steer North Korea away from a
burgeoning confrontation over missiles and nuclear weapons
Saturday, with promises of fresh assistance backed by warnings of
allied resolve.
</P>
<P>
   The allied leaders said they hoped their carrot-and-stick
approach will persuade isolated, famine-stricken North Korea to
forego additional tests of 3,300-mile-range missiles and permit
immediate U.S. inspection of an underground site suspected of
potential use in North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea rejected a U.S. demand Wednesday that inspectors be
allowed to view the suspicious underground site.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the United States and South Korea will continue
their ``clear eyed mix'' of continuing engagement with North Korea
coupled with ``deterrence against North Korean aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Kim met for the first time since North Korea alarmed
northern Asia by launching a three-stage, intercontinental missile
over Japanese territory on Aug. 31 and then rejected U.S. demands
to inspect the underground site at Kumchangai near North Korea's
nuclear weapons' development complex.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted the unprecedented visit of a South Korean civilian
cruise ship to North Korea this weekend to symbolize the open,
two-way exchanges that the allies seek with North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told a joint news conference with Kim that he was struck
by the television news coverage of the ship landing that he saw in
his hotel room after arriving from Japan on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us went into our rooms and we turned on the
television and what was the picture? The picture was the tourist
ship going into the North,'' Clinton declared. ``To us, this was
amazing and it was a very beautiful picture.''
</P>
<P>
   The ship, carrying 780 South Korean tourists who paid $2,500
each, is due to complete an unprecedented four-night, five-day stay
in the North Korean port of Changjon on Monday. The South Koreans
are the first tourists from the south to visit North Korea since
the Korean War started in 1950.
</P>

   The ship's stopover is the first of a series of visits designed
to generate $150 million for North Korea over the next six years.
The port is gateway to Diamond Mountain, an isolated coastal area
featuring towering crags and steep valleys that is being developed
in a joint venture between South Korea and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said the image on
television ``offered a visual picture of what the potential
advantages are to this open, engagement policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton contrasted the promise of such exchanges with the
looming dispute over ``some hole in the ground somewhere in North
Korea where something might or might not be done, which might or
might not be threatening to us in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added: ``Nothing could ever be put in that hole in the
ground that would give the North Koreans as much advantage, as much
power, as much wealth, as much happiness as more of those ships
going up there full of people from here.''
</P>
<P>
   National security adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger said the
United States could offer potential ``carrots'' to North Korea by
easing Korean War-era sanctions if North Korea scaled back missile
development and missile exports and ``chose to forego clearly and
unequivocally a nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and Kim matched their overtures with statements of
resolve. Clinton warned North Korea four times and Kim warned his
neighboring nation twice about the dire circumstances that would
arise if it failed to avoid ``further provocations.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and South Korea waged the Korean War to turn
back North Korean aggression, a conflict that ended with a cease
fire in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which has 37,000 U.S. armed forces stationed
in Korea, is committed to going to war to defend South Korea
against any North Korean attack.
</P>
<P>
   Pyongyang could jeopardize the thin reed of outside assistance
unless it cooperates with allied demands, Clinton warned. ``It
would be a sad thing indeed if for no good end over the long run,
North Korea were to make it impossible for us to go forward.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Neither Clinton nor Berger offered evidence to support American
concern that the underground complex could be used to revive North
Korea's nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complex hole in the ground _ put it that way,'' Berger
said. ``I don't want to describe the site. But we believe that the
physical inspection of the site would help us ascertain its
purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador Charles Kartman, who led the U.S. team to North Korea
last week, said the United States does not have concrete evidence
that the underground site will be used for a nuclear facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is strong information that makes us suspicious, but we
lack conclusive evidence that the intended purpose of the
underground site is nuclear related,'' Kartman said.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said that U.S. officials are satisfied at this point that
North Korea has complied with the 1994 accord targeting nuclear
weapons related facilities at Yongbyon.
</P>
<P>
   Pyongyang agreed with the United States, South Korea and Japan
to suspend its quest for nuclear weapons in return for free
shipments of 500,000 tons of heating oil each year and construction
of two non-weapons producing nuclear power stations at a cost of
$4.6 billion to an international consortium.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has demanded at least $300 million to permit U.S.
inspectors to visit the suspect site. U.S. officials have rejected
the condition.

that spot for nearly three months, and belong to a man who is, more
or less, neither here nor there. He is Tim Floyd, Basketball's Man
Without a Definite Capacity. He is either the new coach of the
World Champion Chicago Bulls and successor to Phil Jackson, or he
is not. He is either the team's director of basketball operations,
a new Bulls' designation, or he is not. He is either their new

SPORTS COLUMN: STEINBRENNER'S $600 MILLION CAKE  (JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nobody is supposed to be able to have his cake and
eat it too, but George Steinbrenner is about to do just that. And
it might be a $600-million cake.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Steinbrenner, according to two of his business
associates, is close to agreeing to the sale of a ``significant
portion'' of his 60 percent share in the Yankees to Cablevision
early next year, nothing would change in the Yankee power structure
except for his title.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that the Yankees' principal owner didn't even put up
all $10 million when his group purchased the Yankee franchise in
1973, that's a tidy profit without any loss of muscle.
</P>
<P>
   When the sale is finalized, possibly for $600 million, the
Yankees would not be George Steinbrenner's team in the corporate
sense. But the Yankees would still be his team in the control
sense, and control is the name of his game.
</P>
<P>
   Control in deciding how many millions to offer Bernie Williams
or Albert Belle this week in the free-agent auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Control in deciding when to dismiss the manager or the general
manager or the pitching coach or the switchboard operator.
</P>
<P>
   Control in deciding when or when not to listen to his baseball
``people,'' whoever they might be at that moment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to be determined, however, would be how much control he
would have in deciding the future of Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Although Steinbrenner no longer would be the principal owner, he
is expected to have an equally intimidating new title: managing
partner. The sight of him in his blue blazer and white turtleneck
would still be more feared at Yankee Stadium than any or all of
those Cablevision suits and ties.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the now 68-year-old Steinbrenner is in command, he
will remain behind his big desk in his Stadium office up there
behind his royal box. As long as he's the managing partner, he will
be conferring with Joe Torre and his front-office people as well as
exhorting or exiling players.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner wouldn't have it any other way. His identity as the
Yankee boss is his life.
</P>
<P>
   Anything less, any deal that allowed anybody else to outvote him
or overrule him in the operation of the Yankees, would never fit
his ego or his personality. No matter how many Yankee shares
Cablevision owns, no matter how much percentage it supposedly
controls, its suits and ties would be silent partners.
</P>
<P>
   John McMullen, the hockey Devils owner who was once a Yankee
limited partner, has said, ``Nothing is as limited as a limited
partner of George Steinbrenner.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the Yankee deal is finalized, all those Cablevision
suits and ties will discover there's nothing as silent as a silent
partner of George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it's a brilliant business buy for Cablevision. For its
$600 million, Cablevision would be assured of Yankee programming in
a continuation of its 12-year, $486 million contract. Charles
Dolan, the Cablevision major domo, might have had to put up $600
million for the next contract anyway.
</P>
<P>
   If the $600-million pricetag materializes, Steinbrenner would
also raise the financial roof of every major-league baseball
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, baseball's most expensive deal was the $311 million
that Rupert Murdoch, the Australian media mogul, paid for the Los
Angeles Dodgers, but that purchase included Dodger Stadium as well
as real estate in Vero Beach, Fla., the Dominican Republic and
around Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, pro football's expansion Cleveland Browns
franchise brought $530 million, the record price for a sports
franchise in North America.
</P>
<P>
   With the Yankees about to raise the roof, every major-league
clubowner should drop a thank-you note to Steinbrenner for
increasing the value of every club.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the Yankee negotiations reportedly involved the
possibility of Steinbrenner also operating Cablevision's two
Madison Square Garden franchises, the basketball Knicks and the
hockey Rangers. But that might be too much cake, even for
Steinbrenner, to have and to eat.
</P>
<P>
   In his quarter of a century as the Yankees principal owner, his
teams have won four World Series championships, including two in
the last three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But the stunning success of this year's Yankees, who swept the
World Series for a record total of 125 victories, enabled
Steinbrenner to seek a record price for the franchise while
retaining control of the operation. That's having your cake, with
pin-striped icing, and eating it too.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Judiciary Committee hearing wore on into the
night last Thursday, Kenneth Starr came to resemble not so much a
congressional witness as a defendant in the dock. It was a display
of how much President Clinton's supporters have succeeded in
turning the issue before the nation from the impeachability of the
president to the behavior of Starr, the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   When David Kendall, the president's lawyer, questioned him near
the end of the hearing, Starr was goaded into shedding his Mr.
Rogers-goes-to-Congress-to-explain-things manner. Instead, he was
briefly reduced to indignant denials. And, although Kendall is the
president's defense lawyer, he did not spend a moment of his
allotted hour defending the president.
</P>
<P>
   There was really only The Case Against Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The main arguments about the behavior and approach of Starr and
his associates concern how they have treated witnesses, notably
Monica Lewinsky, and whether they leaked confidential grand jury
proceedings. Critics have also raised other issues, including
whether Starr was involved improperly in Paula Corbin Jones' sexual
harassment lawsuit against the president.
</P>
<P>
   In their effort to portray Starr as vindictive and
unprofessional, Democrats have hinted darkly that Starr broke some
rule or violated some law. But the rules that govern prosecutorial
conduct are, for the most part, vaguely worded exhortations and
proscriptions in bar association manuals and Justice Department
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Charles Wolfram of the Cornell Law School, an
authority in legal ethics, said the rules about prosecutorial
misconduct are inherently vague and have been intentionally left
that way by the courts. ``Courts continually say that it is not the
behavior of the prosecutor that should be put on trial unless
there's something really extraordinary that happens,'' he said.
Moreover, he said, ``you never get a sharp definition of what these
vaguely orded guidelines mean.''
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Starr have been lobbed in the highly
specialized and partisan context of an impeachment proceeding, an
atmosphere with the subtlety of, say, Monday Night Football. In
such a proceeding, Wolfram said, the nuances of Starr's behavior
matter far less than broad impressions about whether he is fair.
``He can't just be another prosecutor playing fast and loose with
the rules,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the battle for perceptions, Starr suffered a blow Friday when
Samuel Dash abruptly resigned as his ethics adviser. The presence
of Dash, who was counsel to the Senate Watergate committee in 1973,
lent an air of rectitude to Starr's operation. Dash praised Starr's
overall conduct, but said that he had overstepped his bounds by
becoming an advocate for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But just as everyday prosecutors are rarely punished for
wrongdoing, Starr and his deputies are largely immune from penalty
even if some of the charges against them prove true. As an
independent counsel, he is chiefly the judge of his own behavior,
although he could be fired for misconduct by Attorney General Janet
Reno. She has shown little interest so far in complaints from the
White House about Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The area in which the guidelines are the most explicit and the
issue that may pose the greatest threat to Starr is the allegation
that his office improperly leaked grand jury information. The
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure flatly prohibit prosecutors
from disclosing grand jury matters.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Judge Norma Holloway Johnson ruled that 24 news
accounts about the investigation of President Clinton appear to
show that prosecutors in Starr's office discussed grand jury
matters with reporters. The judge described the articles and
broadcasts as ``serious and repetitive'' evidence that Starr and
his staff may have violated the law. As a result, Starr now has to
prove that his office was not responsible for any of those 24 news
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The issue produced the liveliest moments in the Starr-Kendall
confrontation Thursday night. Kendall read from some of the news
accounts, noting that they included phrases like, ``sources in
Starr's office tell us,'' ``sources near Starr,'' and ``prosecutors
suggest.'' He then asked, ``Does the media make up these quotes,
Mr. Starr?''
</P>
<P>
   Starr replied, ``I'm not here to accuse the media of anything,''
adding that the matter was under litigation and it was unfair to
raise it publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall countered, ``Mr. Starr, in fact, there has been no case
remotely similar to this in terms of the massive leaking from the
prosecutor's office, and I think we know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr replied: ``I totally disagree with that. That's an
accusation and it's an unfair accusation. I completely reject it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Judge Johnson were to find that Starr or his deputies
improperly disclosed grand jury materials, they could face
sanctions. The Judge could formally censure anyone in Starr's
office found to have violated the law, a significant blow to a
legal career.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also defended himself against charges that Ms. Lewinsky
was mistreated when his prosecutors first confronted her in a
suburban Virginia hotel last January. She told a grand jury she was
threatened, detained and discouraged from calling her lawyer or her
mother. ``You're 24, you're smart,'' she said a prosecutor told
her. ``You're old enough. You don't need to call your mommy.''
</P>
<P>
   However heavy-handed those comments might have been, the issue
that might run afoul of ethics guidelines is whether the
prosecutors tried to engage her as a witness after she asked to
speak to her lawyer.

prosecutors tried to engage her as a witness after she asked to
speak to her lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Under Rule 4.2 the American Bar Association Model Rules of
Professional Conduct, lawyers, including prosecutors, may not talk
directly to someone who might be involved in litigation or an
investigation if they know that person is represented by a lawyer.
A separate bar association manual on criminal matters makes it even
clearer that prosecutors should step aside immediately when they
learn someone they are interviewing is represented by a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened there was very improper,'' said Professor
Geoffrey Hazard of the University of Pennsylvania Law School. The
issue was so basic, he said, that even people whose only
information comes from television shows know that prosecutors are
not supposed to talk to subjects of an investigation once it's
clear they have a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   But Professor Bob Tuttle of the George Washington University Law
School said the situation is far from clear and that Starr may not
be bound by those guidelines. The manual for prosecutors is only
advisory, he said, and the Justice Department has long resisted
efforts to make the model code apply to its prosecutors. Congress
has approved legislation requiring the Justice Department to adhere
to the model code, he said, but it takes effect late next year.
</P>
<P>
   Although Starr is independent from the Justice Department, the
law authorizing his appointment provides that he must adhere to
department guidelines whenever possible. But Starr made clear that
he believed the guidelines were not an issue because Ms. Lewinsky's
perception that she was being threatened was inaccurate, and
because she had been free to leave the hotel at any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used traditional law enforcement techniques,'' he said in
response to charges that the prosecutors threatened Ms. Lewinsky
with 27 years in jail and her mother's imprisonment. In fact, such
threats are common in the hard-edged world of modern prosecutors.
And he said his prosecutors did not have to allow Ms. Lewinsky to
contact her lawyer because he represented her in a civil matter,
the Paula Jones case, not a criminal matter.
</P>
<P>
   On only one point did Starr give some ground. He conceded that
his agents may have gone too far if, as alleged, they went to the
school of a 16-year-old in Arkansas to serve a subpoena on him.

   JERUSALEM _ For well over half a century, the political contours
of the Zionist movement and Israel have been defined by a division
between those who are prepared to share the biblical Jewish
homeland with the Arabs, and those who claim it all.
</P>
<P>
   At Israel's founding in 1948, the Labor Zionist leadership,
which went on to govern Israel in its first three decades of
independence, accepted a pragmatic partition of what had been
British Palestine into independent Jewish and Arab states. The
opposition Revisionist Zionists, who evolved into today's Likud
party, sought ``Eretz Yisrael Ha-Shlema'' _ Greater Israel, or
literally, the Whole Land of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Through all the years that followed, that basic divergence in
outlook continued to define the difference between Labor and Likud,
the two principal movements in Israeli politics. Even after the
Camp David accords of 1978, the Oslo accords of 1993, and the
withdrawal of Israeli troops from most of Hebron last year, it was
still possible to think that a Likud government might halt or
reverse the process of turning over West Bank land to Arab control.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, Israel's parliament went through the last formal
act of closing that historical political divide. At the instigation
of Likud's most important leaders, it approved the latest
Israeli-Palestinian accord by a large majority that crossed party
lines, and sanctioned a handover of territory that will leave the
Palestinians in full or partial control of 40 percent of the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the vote took the dream of a Greater Israel out of
the political mainstream and relegated it to the margins of Israeli
politics.
</P>
<P>
   The death knell of Greater Israel was barely audible during a
raucous late-night vote boycotted by several Cabinet members from
the Likud. It was left to Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, long a
champion of Jewish settlement in the West Bank and a vocal opponent
of territorial compromise, to acknowledge the enormous shift that
had occurred in his political camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of another nation that would have given up areas
linked to its historical heritage,'' Sharon declared, ``but we in
the government had to decide whether we want to make a real and
honest effort to reach arrangements that may bring peace between us
and our neighbors. The government's response was yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The triumph of pragmatism blurred traditional distinctions.
Likud, despite defections, had joined Labor in accepting the
inevitability of territorial compromise, and Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu worked to get the agreement passed in de facto
alliance with the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Approval of the agreement, which transfers significant areas
to the Palestinian Authority, has historic value because it will be
carried out by a government of the right,' the newspaper Haaretz
commented in an editorial. ``It will be difficult in the future to
go back to a policy of Greater Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   This was, of course, anathema to hard-core followers of Vladimir
Jabotinsky, the founder of the Revisionist movement, who in 1937
declared that partition would be ``the death of humanitarian
Zionism'' because it would leave no room for millions of Jewish
immigrants fleeing persecution, and would make a Jewish state
indefensible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Likud party is virtually nonexistent,'' lamented Yitzhak
Shamir, a former prime minister who was a leader of the Irgun, a
Revisionist underground during the British Mandate in Palestine.
``Nothing is left of what was our backbone: the principle that the
Land of Israel is indivisible.''
</P>
<P>
   Revolutionary as it may seem, Likud's abandonment of its
maximalist vision has in fact been evolving for years.
</P>
<P>
   The seed was sown in 1977, when Menachem Begin of Likud brought
his party to power for the first time in a stunning election
victory over Labor. A decade before, in the 1967 war, Israeli
troops had in effect undone the partition accepted in 1948 by
overrunning the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Ever since, Begin had
preached undying loyalty to what he called Judea and Samaria (the
West Bank lands) and promoted Jewish settlement there. But he did
not annex the West Bank and Gaza to Israel after he took office,
reflecting a recognition that absorbing the Palestinians could turn
Israel it into a binational state instead of a Jewish one.
</P>
<P>
   After Egyptian President Anwar Sadat visited Israel in 1977,
Begin proposed autonomy for the Palestinians, suggesting that the
question of ultimate sovereignty over the occupied territories be
set aside. The plan lacked a territorial dimension, offering the
Palestinians administration of their own affairs under Israeli
rule, but it signaled an early readiness to acknowledge competing
claims to the same land.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1978 Camp David accords with Egypt, Begin took a further
step, agreeing to negotiate a transitional period of Palestinian
self-government in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and a final
agreement on those areas with Egypt, Jordan and Palestinian
representatives. Yet Begin continued to encourage Jewish settlement
in the occupied territories in an effort to block any possibility
of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Shamir, who succeeded Begin, sat face-to-face with Palestinian
representatives from the territories at the 1991 Middle East peace
talks in Madrid, even as they consulted more or less openly with
leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organization.

   Netanyahu, in turn, committed himself during his election
campaign to honor the 1993 Oslo accord on Palestinian self-rule
signed by the previous Labor government, effectively assenting to a
withdrawal in the West Bank. He then signed on to the process
himself in the 1997 Hebron agreement, which set the terms for a
pullout from most of the city and for further Israeli withdrawals
in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Policy is a combination of vision and reality, and we have
come to terms with reality,'' said Dan Meridor, a Likud lawmaker
who was a close aide to Begin and served in Netanyahu's Cabinet.
``The new line of the Likud is that we are going for a compromise,
but let's fight for every inch we can.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a black or white picture any more,'' Meridor added.
``The question now isn't whether to compromise or not, but what
sort of compromise, how big or how small. We're more like America,
where the issue is who is more hawkish or dovish.''
</P>
<P>
   As ideological differences over the price of peace fade,
conventional labels of right and left could grow increasingly
irrelevant, giving way to new political alignments. Disputes
between secular and religious Israelis, gaps between rich and poor
and tensions between Sephardic and Ashkenazic Jews have already
emerged as defining issues for powerful political constituencies.
``The political map no longer reflects the real divisions in
Israeli society,'' Meridor said.
</P>
<P>
   Avishai Margalit, a prominent Israeli political philosopher,
said that after the latest accord, the public seemed to be shifting
its attention from peacemaking to more mundane matters that impact
directly on the quality of daily life, such as health services,
economic opportunity and local politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it the era of post peace, as if peace has already been
achieved,'' Margalit said. ``The public perception is that the
ideological debate has been decided, the Likud has accepted
compromise, and now it's just up to the lawyers to hammer out the
percentages. We've already bought the apartment.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Nov. 22, moved Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   This final budget adds STARR-REVIEW.
</P>
<P>
   (`a' category) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STARR-REVIEW (Washington) _ A look at The Case Against Kenneth
Starr. The main arguments about the behavior and approach of Starr
and his associates concern how they have treated witnesses, notably
Monica Lewinsky, and whether they leaked confidential grand jury
proceedings. Critics have also raised other issues, including
whether Starr was involved improperly in Paula Jones' sexual
harassment lawsuit against the president. By Neil A. Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICAL-EQUIPMENT-REVIEW (Undated) _ With thousands of new tools
and techniques introduced into medicine each year, doctors face
constant pressure to stay abreast of technology. And savvy patients
shop around for those who will perform the latest procedures
advertised in newspapers or discussed at dinner parties. But what
most patients don't know is how skilled their doctors are with the
new equipment. The physicians using it, sometimes for the first
time, may have taken only a three-hour course or watched a video or
chatted with the manufacturer's sales representative. By Susan
Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   LIFE-REDIRECTION-REVIEW (Undated) _ Americans have always had
second acts. They have been immigrants beginning anew. They have
left behind families and scrawled ``Gone to Texas'' on the walls of
their houses. They have moved like gypsies and even in the most
conventional lives, have left their familiar world behind for a new
life at La Boca Vista in the Florida sun. What is new is that so
many Americans are now having third and fourth and fifth acts, they
are having them later in life and numerous trends may be making
them unavoidable. By Peter Applebome. (There is also an abridged
version of this story, EXP-LIFE-REDIRECTION-REVIEW.)
</P>
<P>
   STARWARS-TRAILER-REVIEW (Undated) _ For ``Star Wars''
enthusiasts, the hottest film shown last week had its sneak preview
announced on the Internet and sent a small army of fans into
theaters around the country to watch it over and over again. It was
the two-minute trailer for ``The Phantom Menace,'' George Lucas'
latest installment in what is being billed as a prequel to the
``Star Wars'' trilogy. The actual film is due in theaters on May
21, 1999. By J.D. Biersdorfer. (There is also an abridged version
of this story, EXP-STARWARS-TRAILER-REVIEW.)
</P>
<P>
   WELFARE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Despite an overall tightening of
welfare, the federal government is prodding many state and local
governments to encourage poor people to apply for food stamps and
Medicaid. The fear is that governments may be blocking access to
such aid programs, which are considered vital entitlements that
keep working people off welfare and the newly employed from
slipping back on. By Rachel L. Swarns. (There is also an abridged
version of this story, EXP-WELFARE-REVIEW.)
</P>
<P>
   MARKET-REACTIONS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The market is made up of two
voices. One that votes with its funds, another that worries over
the economic data. The gulf between these two voices is wider now
than it has been in a long time. By Gretchen Morgnson.
</P>
<P>
   BOMBER-THREAT-REVIEW (Undated) _ What to do when a bomber calls:
a checklist from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco abnd Firearms.
(This will be sent only as a GRAPHIC and will only be posted to the
data bases, not sent via AP.)
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-DIPLOMACY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Diplomatic etiquette has
usually discouraged shouting America's enemies list from the White
House rooftop. But last week, driven by frustration, or anxiety, or
perhaps the lure of sounding tough for cameras, the Clinton
administration yelled out loud, twice. In dramatically different
situations, in opposite corners of the world, the U.S. spoke loudly
because it can't find a stick. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-ARABS-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ For many decades, the
political contours of the Zionist movement and Israel have been
defined by a division between those who are prepared to share the
Biblical Jewish homeland with the Arabs, and those who claim it
all. Last week, Israel's parliament went through the last formal
act of closing that historical political divide. By Joel Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
   CHILE-REVIEW (Santiago) _ The controversy here over Britain's
arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet represents what may well be the
most serious test of Chile's transition to democracy since Pinochet
left the presidency eight years ago. But the fact that the reaction
was not as explosive as it might have been suggests how much Chile
has calmed in recent years, after decades of inflamed passions. By
Clifford Krauss.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Nov. 22, moved Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   This final budget adds STARR-REVIEW.
</P>
<P>
   (`a' category) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STARR-REVIEW (Washington) _ A look at The Case Against Kenneth
Starr. The main arguments about the behavior and approach of Starr
and his associates concern how they have treated witnesses, notably
Monica Lewinsky, and whether they leaked confidential grand jury
proceedings. Critics have also raised other issues, including
whether Starr was involved improperly in Paula Jones' sexual
harassment lawsuit against the president. By Neil A. Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICAL-EQUIPMENT-REVIEW (Undated) _ With thousands of new tools
and techniques introduced into medicine each year, doctors face
constant pressure to stay abreast of technology. And savvy patients
shop around for those who will perform the latest procedures
advertised in newspapers or discussed at dinner parties. But what
most patients don't know is how skilled their doctors are with the
new equipment. The physicians using it, sometimes for the first
time, may have taken only a three-hour course or watched a video or
chatted with the manufacturer's sales representative. By Susan
Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   LIFE-REDIRECTION-REVIEW (Undated) _ Americans have always had
second acts. They have been immigrants beginning anew. They have
left behind families and scrawled ``Gone to Texas'' on the walls of
their houses. They have moved like gypsies and even in the most
conventional lives, have left their familiar world behind for a new
life at La Boca Vista in the Florida sun. What is new is that so
many Americans are now having third and fourth and fifth acts, they
are having them later in life and numerous trends may be making
them unavoidable. By Peter Applebome. (There is also an abridged
version of this story, EXP-LIFE-REDIRECTION-REVIEW.)
</P>
<P>
   STARWARS-TRAILER-REVIEW (Undated) _ For ``Star Wars''
enthusiasts, the hottest film shown last week had its sneak preview
announced on the Internet and sent a small army of fans into
theaters around the country to watch it over and over again. It was
the two-minute trailer for ``The Phantom Menace,'' George Lucas'
latest installment in what is being billed as a prequel to the
``Star Wars'' trilogy. The actual film is due in theaters on May
21, 1999. By J.D. Biersdorfer. (There is also an abridged version
of this story, EXP-STARWARS-TRAILER-REVIEW.)
</P>
<P>
   WELFARE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Despite an overall tightening of
welfare, the federal government is prodding many state and local
governments to encourage poor people to apply for food stamps and
Medicaid. The fear is that governments may be blocking access to
such aid programs, which are considered vital entitlements that
keep working people off welfare and the newly employed from
slipping back on. By Rachel L. Swarns. (There is also an abridged
version of this story, EXP-WELFARE-REVIEW.)
</P>
<P>
   MARKET-REACTIONS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The market is made up of two
voices. One that votes with its funds, another that worries over
the economic data. The gulf between these two voices is wider now
than it has been in a long time. By Gretchen Morgnson.
</P>
<P>
   BOMBER-THREAT-REVIEW (Undated) _ What to do when a bomber calls:
a checklist from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco abnd Firearms.
(This will be sent only as a GRAPHIC and will only be posted to the
data bases, not sent via AP.)
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-DIPLOMACY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Diplomatic etiquette has
usually discouraged shouting America's enemies list from the White
House rooftop. But last week, driven by frustration, or anxiety, or
perhaps the lure of sounding tough for cameras, the Clinton
administration yelled out loud, twice. In dramatically different
situations, in opposite corners of the world, the U.S. spoke loudly
because it can't find a stick. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-ARABS-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ For many decades, the
political contours of the Zionist movement and Israel have been
defined by a division between those who are prepared to share the
Biblical Jewish homeland with the Arabs, and those who claim it
all. Last week, Israel's parliament went through the last formal
act of closing that historical political divide. By Joel Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
   CHILE-REVIEW (Santiago) _ The controversy here over Britain's
arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet represents what may well be the
most serious test of Chile's transition to democracy since Pinochet
left the presidency eight years ago. But the fact that the reaction
was not as explosive as it might have been suggests how much Chile
has calmed in recent years, after decades of inflamed passions. By
Clifford Krauss.

   For U.N. Inspectors, It's Back to Iraq
</P>
<P>
   International arms inspectors went back to work in Iraq, at
least to restart a system interrupted by Iraqi bans and the
withdrawal of monitors in advance of expected U.S. bombing.
Short-notice inspections of new sites awaited the formation of
expert teams from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, President Saddam Hussein's controlled press went on
attacking the chief inspector, Richard Butler, an outspoken
Australian, and dropped hints that his new teams might hit some old
walls when the toughest inspections resume.

<P>
   The Fed Decides To Take No Chances
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has rebounded in the last few months, and the
global financial crisis seems to have eased. But the Federal
Reserve remained sufficiently concerned about the economic outlook
for the United States that it cut interest rates for the third time
in two months.
</P>
<P>
   The quarter-point cut may have been the Fed's last move for a
while, though. The central bank said it thinks rates are now at a
level that should help the economy grow at a healthy pace.

   A Light Show In the Night Sky
</P>
<P>
   For most meteor fanciers, the Leonid show Tuesday night was
mediocre; at most, some 2,000 shooting stars blazed across the sky
per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Storms of Leonid meteors _ tiny fragmentsof Comet Tuttle-Tempel
moving at 155,000 miles an hour _ tend to hit the Earth's
atmosphere at intervals of about 33 years, and this year there were
hopes of celestial fireworks as impressive as those of a vintage
year: 1966.
</P>
<P>
   It was not to be, although the show was better than those of
most off-years, and viewers in some places (the Canary Islands,
among others) saw some spectacular fireballs. After the storm,
worried operators of the 600 or so communications, surveillance,
scientific and navigation satellites that orbit the Earth were
relieved to learn that their costly spacecraft apparently escaped
damage.
</P>
<P>
   _ MALCOLM W. BROWNE &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Out West, Microsoft Loses a Round
</P>
<P>
   For Microsoft, the main event is its antitrust showdown with the
Justice Department in Washington, but that isn't the only stage on
which allegations that it engaged in anticompetitive practices are
being heard. The company suffered a stinging legal setback in
Silicon Valley when a federal judge in San Jose told the computer
software giant it could no longer ship Internet software that
violated its contract with a rival, Sun Microsystems. The judge
gave Microsoft 90 days to modify its products.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Justice Department case, the Sun Microsystems suit
focuses on Microsoft's business practices and includes allegations
that Microsoft tried to undermine the challenge posed by a
competitor _ in this case, Sun's Java Internet programming
language. It did this, according to the Sun suit, by illegally
altering the Java software it licensed from Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Sun is calling this a breach of contract. Nonsense, Microsoft
has answered, insisting it was merely trying to improve Sun's buggy
software.

</P>
<P>
   A New Blow To Affirmative Action
</P>
<P>
   The national debate over affirmative action in education moved
from the realm of higher education to the public-school level when
a three-judge federal appeals panel in Boston struck down racial
preferences at Boston Latin School, the city's top public high
school.
</P>
<P>
   Although the use of race in university admissions was barred two
years ago by a federal appeals court in a case involving the
University of Texas, the situation in which public schools found
themselves was considered more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, for example, the public schools had operated for
years under judicial orders to achieve racial integration. Today,
Boston Latin selects half its students only on exam scores and
grades, with the other half of admissions weighted according to
race.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, in a case brought by a father whose white child did
not get into Boston Latin, is expected to draw intense interest
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   A New Kind Of Space Flight
</P>
<P>
   A new era in human space exploration opened as another closed,
both with great fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 40 years ago, mankind's first steps off its planet began
as rival nations sought to prove their superiority. The Soviet
Union stunned the world in 1961 when Yuri Gagarin became the first
human to orbit the Earth. Ten months later, the United States sent
John Glenn up to circle the Earth three times and become a national
hero.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, New York celebrated Glenn's recent space shuttle flight
by reprising the tickertape parade given him 36 years before. It
seemed fitting that a man made famous by the space race would be
there as it ended.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all future shuttle flights are devoted not to the U.S.
space program, but to building an international space station
sponsored by 16 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The first segment of that station was launched by Russia Friday
from the Baikonur base in Kazakhstan, from which Gagarin made his
flight. The project essentially combines the world's piloted space
programs, turning competitors into colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   _ WARREN E. LEARY
</P>
<P>
   A Landmark's Second Chance
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three years ago it became one of the most infamous towers
in the country when a student, Charles Whitman, barricaded himself
on the observation deck of the 307-foot University of Texas clock
tower and started spraying gunfire at passersby below. By the time
police killed him an hour and a half later, 14 people were dead and
31 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years later, in 1975, after a series of suicides by people
jumping from the observation deck, the university decided to close
the tower to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Now the university has announced that it will reopen the tower _
after installing iron barriers to deter suicides and assigning
security personnel to accompany visitors to the observation deck.
</P>
<P>
   A New Tobacco Deal
</P>
<P>
   The nation's biggest tobacco companies agreed to a deal with
state attorneys general under which they would pay $206 billion
over 25 years to the states in exchange for ending state lawsuits
against cigarette makers based on health costs associated with
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is a scaled-back version of a $368.5 billion settlement
plan announced last year that would have included measures like
federal nicotine regulation and an assessment of fines on the
companies if youth smoking did not decline. That plan was derailed
when Congress did not go along.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan, with its more modest goals, does not require
congressional approval. It includes financing for campaigns to
deter youth smoking; cigarette makers also agreed to stop some
marketing practices, including the use of billboards.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement covers 46 states that have sued the industry for
reimbursement, or are in a position to sue. The other four have
settled cases against cigarette makers based on the cost of
treating tobacco-related illness.

   The New Alamo Battle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   History is a blood sport in Texas, with the latest battle over a
diary by a disgruntled 19th-century Mexican officer. Among other
things, Jose Enrique de la Pena, who fought on the winning side at
the Alamo, said that Davy Crockett did not go down swinging, as
popular myth would have it, but was captured and tortured to death.
And not before trying to talk his way out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Most professional historians who have looked at the diary
believe it is genuine, pointing to tests on the age of the paper
and corroborating accounts. But others, many of them Alamo
hobbyists, believe just as fervently that it's a fake, citing
apparent anachronisms and plagiarisms.
</P>
<P>
   Now the pro-diary forces have won a round; the papers fetched
$350,000 at a Los Angeles auction when a pair of anonymous Texans
bought them to make sure the diary stays in the state.

<P>
   Freeh Sends a Signal. Or Does He?
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis Freeh's inner circle has always regarded him
as a potential Republican candidate back home in New York, although
Freeh has shrugged off talk of a political future, citing his
10-year term, which expires in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Now things may be changing. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan is
retiring, and New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani may enter the
race for Moynihan's seat. And Freeh has kick-started gossip in the
capital by inviting former President George Bush to be keynote
speaker at the FBI's 90th anniversary celebration at Constitution
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Some of President Clinton's political appointees at the Justice
Department winced at the selection of Bush, but said ruefully that
Freeh has often seemed eager to distance himself from the
Democratic president who appointed him.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? Freeh's career has had a succession of Republican
patrons: Giuliani, who as U.S. attorney in New York made Freeh a
top prosecutor; Richard Thornburgh, who as attorney general had
Freeh lead a high-profile prosecution, and Bush, who as president
appointed Freeh a federal judge.

   _ DAVID JOHNSTON &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Most Valuable. But to Whom?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the nation's baseball writers voted on Thursday to give the
National League's Most Valuable Player award to the Chicago Cubs
slugger Sammy Sosa rather than the St. Louis Cardinals' Mark
McGwire, they underscored how malleable the term ``value'' is in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he obliterated Roger Maris' record with 70 home runs
and was an unquestionably superior offensive force, McGwire lost
out to Sosa because he played on a mediocre team while Sosa led his
Cubs to a wild-card playoff berth. Some writers listed McGwire
sixth or seventh on their ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Which focuses attention on a question left unanswered by the
award: most valuable to whom?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not to the popularity of sport itself, in which case
McGwire would have won (or at least shared the prize with Sosa).
</P>
<P>
   And apparently not necessarily to the player's team. On the one

   The New Alamo Battle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   History is a blood sport in Texas, with the latest battle over a
diary by a disgruntled 19th-century Mexican officer. Among other
things, Jose Enrique de la Pena, who fought on the winning side at
the Alamo, said that Davy Crockett did not go down swinging, as
popular myth would have it, but was captured and tortured to death.
And not before trying to talk his way out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Most professional historians who have looked at the diary
believe it is genuine, pointing to tests on the age of the paper
and corroborating accounts. But others, many of them Alamo
hobbyists, believe just as fervently that it's a fake, citing
apparent anachronisms and plagiarisms.
</P>
<P>
   Now the pro-diary forces have won a round; the papers fetched
$350,000 at a Los Angeles auction when a pair of anonymous Texans
bought them to make sure the diary stays in the state.

<P>
   Freeh Sends a Signal. Or Does He?
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis Freeh's inner circle has always regarded him
as a potential Republican candidate back home in New York, although
Freeh has shrugged off talk of a political future, citing his
10-year term, which expires in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Now things may be changing. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan is
retiring, and New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani may enter the
race for Moynihan's seat. And Freeh has kick-started gossip in the
capital by inviting former President George Bush to be keynote
speaker at the FBI's 90th anniversary celebration at Constitution
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Some of President Clinton's political appointees at the Justice
Department winced at the selection of Bush, but said ruefully that
Freeh has often seemed eager to distance himself from the
Democratic president who appointed him.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? Freeh's career has had a succession of Republican
patrons: Giuliani, who as U.S. attorney in New York made Freeh a
top prosecutor; Richard Thornburgh, who as attorney general had
Freeh lead a high-profile prosecution, and Bush, who as president
appointed Freeh a federal judge.

   _ DAVID JOHNSTON &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Most Valuable. But to Whom?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the nation's baseball writers voted on Thursday to give the
National League's Most Valuable Player award to the Chicago Cubs
slugger Sammy Sosa rather than the St. Louis Cardinals' Mark
McGwire, they underscored how malleable the term ``value'' is in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he obliterated Roger Maris' record with 70 home runs
and was an unquestionably superior offensive force, McGwire lost
out to Sosa because he played on a mediocre team while Sosa led his
Cubs to a wild-card playoff berth. Some writers listed McGwire
sixth or seventh on their ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Which focuses attention on a question left unanswered by the
award: most valuable to whom?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not to the popularity of sport itself, in which case
McGwire would have won (or at least shared the prize with Sosa).
</P>
<P>
   And apparently not necessarily to the player's team. On the one
hand, McGwire this year seems to have been so stigmatized by the
company he kept that the writers ignored the fact that he was his
team's greatest strength. On the other hand, McGwire just can't
catch a break. Playing for the Oakland Athletics in 1987, he tied
for the major league lead with 49 home runs but finished just sixth
in the most-valuable-player vote.
</P>

PERSONAL AND POLITICAL STRUGGLES FOR STRIPERS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By TOM BRADY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   My friends and I fish all summer in the shadow of Old Barney,
the 140-year-old, 165-foot lighthouse that looms over Barnegat Bay
at the northern tip of Long Beach Island, N.J. It's a rare day when
we don't bring back something for lunch or dinner, be it fluke,
blues or weakfish.
</P>
<P>
   But when the fall rolls around and the temperatures slip below
60, we set our sights on Morone saxatilis, better known as striped
bass. The fish fed settlers along the Atlantic Seaboard for
centuries, but the only way to consume one legally in the state of
New Jersey now is to go out and catch it.
</P>
<P>
   And once you land a keeper (currently a minimum of 28 inches),
you start to appreciate the passion these fish inspire, enough to
keep grown men up all night casting off rain- and wind-swept rock
jetties or lurching boats for a chance to reel in one.
</P>
<P>
   My introduction to striper fishing came three years ago, when I
hooked up with one near the Sedge Islands, at the southern tip of
Island Beach State Park. I was so excited about boating this
beautiful fish, with its distinctive green-shaded striping
reminiscent of its freshwater cousin, the large-mouthed bass, that
I couldn't imagine eating it. I let it go.
</P>
<P>
   This October, however, Greg Setter and I fully intended on
bringing home some meals. The conditions were ideal _ the sun
bright, the sky clear blue, the temperature in the low 60s. We had
a cooler with a dozen live croakers in it and an outgoing tide as
we puttered around the bay in my 19-foot Boston Whaler for 45
minutes or so before we found striper central: an eddy of current
in the bay's main channel where the depth dropped off from about 15
to 25 feet.
</P>
<P>
   For the next hour, we were on to a fish almost every time we
dragged our minnows (with two-ounce weights attached) through that
eddy. First, Greg pulled up a 24-incher, a ``short'' in striper
parlance. As soon as he put it back in the water, I was on to a
keeper. We had a 32-inch fish in the well when Greg and I hooked up
simultaneously, laughing and yelling as we reeled in our heavy
fish.
</P>
<P>
   We had three keepers in the well, plus a 10-pound weakfish, when
we let Greg's second keeper go, saving our limit (it's two fish a
day per person unless you apply to the state for a bonus fish
permit) for what we hoped to be the big kahuna. I released a short
and Greg lost a big one when he tried to set the hook _ he had
pulled a baitfish out of the striper's gullet in the process. Soon
we were out of bait and, like the other boats around us, out of
action.
</P>
<P>
   We saw Victor, our bait supplier, and pulled up to his skiff. He
informed us, surprisingly, that he had no bait to spare. We made
several unproductive drifts with a lure and a dead minnow while we
watched Victor hook up time after time as he passed through the
magic drift. (He would catch 11 fish that day, including a 35-inch,
22-pounder.)
</P>
<P>
   A little while later, Victor relented and gave us some spare
minnows. We didn't land the big kahuna that day but I was certain
we would the next time we fished.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of October, my brother Pat and Charlie LeDuff
joined us. I had regaled them with stories about our previous trip,
and I was mildly worried about how we were going to distribute the
fillets from all the fish we were going to catch.
</P>
<P>
   My fears were unfounded; two days produced only two keepers,
both smaller than the four Greg and I had caught earlier in the
month. I watched Pat and Charlie high-five each other as they
boated their fish, and I was happy for them, to a point.
</P>
<P>
   I would have been happier if I'd had my drag set tighter and not
lost a fish on the one good strike I had in three hours of fishing
on day one. I would have been even happier if I'd landed the fish I
had on the next day, which was definitely a keeper, but I lost it
about 20 feet from the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Still, we had fresh striped bass for dinner, a true delicacy.
Many people never get to taste the sweet, flaky white meat since it
has been illegal to sell wild striped bass in New Jersey for more
than a decade. After the striper population crashed in the early
1980s, Congress passed the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act
in 1984, which severely restricted commercial fishing for stripers
along the East Coast. A moratorium on striped bass harvesting
offshore followed in 1988. (Net fishing for striped bass was banned
in New Jersey in 1952.) Recreational fishing was also heavily
regulated.
</P>
<P>
   Overfishing and pollution contributed to the striper decline,
according to Russ Allen, a senior fisheries biologist for the New
Jersey Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife, but there have been
strong signs of a recovery in the last five years. For instance,
the size limit for a keeper in New Jersey has fallen from 38 inches
in 1990 to its current 28 inches. And Allen reports that surveys of
young striped bass in 1993 and 1996 had the highest indices for the
fish since the survey was started more than 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission reopened the
striped bass fishery as stocks recovered in the 1990s, but New
Jersey still does not permit commercial fishing for stripers.
</P>
<P>
   The state has allocated its quota of 225,000 pounds of striper
to recreational fishermen. Allowing more than two fish to be taken
with a special permit account for only a small percentage of that
quota. The commercial interests feel they should be entitled to the
large, unused portion of the 225,000-pound allocation. They say
they should be allowed to keep the stripers caught in nets they now
have to throw back.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Nicholas Asselta introduced a bill in the New Jersey
State Assembly in June to reintroduce the commercial striped bass
fishery, setting the stage for a battle between two powerful
interests. The political struggle over striped bass has taken place
up and down the Atlantic Coast for at least half a century. With
the fish's remarkable recovery, the argument will only intensify in
the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Also, since striped bass can live as long as 30 years and mature
between 8 and 15 years old, the best fishing _ be it off a boat,
jetty or beach _ is yet to come.

YACHTSMAN SURVIVES AT SEA WITH HELP OF E-MAIL  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA LLOYD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was not the first time in the history of solo yacht racing
that computer technology saved the life of a sailor in distress.
But e-mail assistance provided recently by a physician in Boston
reached out as never before to an ailing yachtsman at sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine?'' asked Viktor Yazykov, the 50-year-old
Russian competing in the Around Alone race, during a telephone
interview Tuesday from Cape Town. ``I was 1,000 miles out in the
ocean, alone in my sailboat with a little lake of blood on the
floor around me, and with the boat rolling from side to side. I
think to myself, `I am going to die.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Help, however, was never farther away than the blip of his
on-board computer screen. E-mail advice was delivered by the
Comsat-C satellite network from Dr. Dan Carlin, an emergency
medicine specialist at New England Medical Center in Boston. It was
the next best thing to a house call considering that Yazykov was
under sail in the South Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The episode began benignly enough. Yazykov had bruised his elbow
before setting out last Oct. 2 from Charleston, S.C., in the
around-the-world sailboat competition. He was six days late for the
start; 15 solo skippers had left before him on a 6,865-mile voyage
to Cape Town, the race's first stopover. Already the leading boat
had a 1,000-mile jump on him. Another competitor, Sebastian Reidl
of Canada, would drop out with gear problems along the way.
</P>
<P>
   But Yazykov, a former Russian paratrooper and disaster worker in
Chernobyl, had dealt with adversity before. To pull away from the
dock aboard his 40-foot sloop, Wind of Change, was tantamount to a
fresh beginning at the upside of a hard life.
</P>
<P>
   As chief executive officer of World Clinic, a global medical
practice, Carlin responded Nov. 10 to Yazykov's e-mail query about
what to do for a painful and swollen elbow. Exacerbated by a
language barrier and a dwindling power supply to Yazykov's laptop,
the Russian's troubles got worse before they improved.
</P>
<P>
   Using the on-board medical kit that Carlin provided each race
skipper at the outset, Yazykov had single-handedly _ and without
anesthetic _ opened his wound and cleaned it under Carlin's
directions.
</P>
<P>
   Only later did Carlin find out that Yazykov had been taking
large amounts of aspirin before seeking help. The blood-thinning
property of aspirin was causing Yazykov's inch-long incision to
bleed profusely.
</P>
<P>
   In panic, and without consulting Carlin, Yazykov tied two shock
cords around the limb to stop the blood flow. Then he strapped his
arm to the boat's overhead handrail in an effort to keep it
suspended. The tourniquet cut off circulation, and left his arm
numb after two hours.
</P>
<P>
   In the last e-mail of the evening, Yazykov explained what was
happening. Carlin messaged him to cut the arm free immediately, and
to apply gentle compression. ``His limb was clearly in jeopardy,''
Carlin said from Boston. ``This was a solo sailor in a moderate
gale. He was despairing. There was blood all over the boat, and his
arm was completely lifeless. Imagine what it must have been like.''
</P>
<P>
   Tired and weak from the effort, Yazykov fell asleep for the
night. In a cryptic e-mail message to race officials before
arriving in Cape Town on Monday, Yazykov said: ``I could manage few
words e-mail to Carlin asking what to do now, not to elbow, but to
save arm. Remembered red wine helps to make new blood, drink half a
bottle and eat chocolate. Deadly tired, fell asleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Awaked in morning. The sun gave life to the battery. Check the
e-mail _ 10 messages from the race office. `Viktor, how are you?'
''
</P>
<P>
   The response made Carlin's day. It also reaffirmed his
conviction that telemedicine has a future. ``For every Viktor
Yazykov, there's a village in China,'' he said later.
</P>
<P>
   When Yazykov arrived in Cape Town on Monday, life was coming
back into his arm. He was also energized by news that he had set a
race record to Cape Town for 40-foot boats. Although he was ahead
of four other competitors in his class, an 11-hour race penalty for
being late at the start has put him at the back.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he is eager to point Wind of Change into a new breeze. On
Dec. 5, the second stage of the Around Alone begins with a
6,884-mile voyage to New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen death a few times in my life,'' Yazykov said. ``It
has been pretty tough life. But I like it.''

IN CANADA, ONE PROVINCE STANDS ALONE VS. TOBACCO 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ In the days since British Columbia became the first
Canadian province to file a lawsuit to recover medical costs from
tobacco companies, Penny Priddy, the province's health minister,
has been traveling across Canada looking for allies.
</P>
<P>
   Taking her cue from the United States, where the joint legal
action by several states has led to a $206-billion tentative
settlement with the tobacco industry, Ms. Priddy has talked to
other provincial health officials about joining the suit, which was
filed Nov. 12.
</P>
<P>
   But so far she has received little more than encouraging words.
Ms. Priddy said that part of the reason for the reluctance of the
other provinces to take on the powerful Canadian tobacco industry
and the U.S. parent companies of the cigarette producers may be the
objections of local tobacco growers. Tobacco is not an important
crop in British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason appears to be an aspect of Canadian law that
makes it possible for the tobacco companies to recover legal costs
if the province's suit fails.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, the tobacco companies are fighting back. Minutes
after the province filed its suit, the cigarette manufacturers
filed their own suit. They are challenging the constitutionality of
the British Columbia law, which reverses the normal legal precedent
that would require the province to prove its allegations. Instead,
the law forces the companies to prove that cigarettes are not
addictive or harmful.
</P>
<P>
   The province's lawsuit is ``a kind of political ploy on the part
of an unpopular government to demonize an unpopular industry,''
said Robert Parker, president of the Canadian Tobacco
Manufacturers' Association, which is also named in the British
Columbia suit. ``It amounts to state-sponsored extortion because
they believe the industry will pay anything it takes'' to be
allowed to stay in business.
</P>
<P>
   British Columbia has some of the toughest anti-smoking laws in
Canada. A new provincial law requires tobacco companies to disclose
the ingredients in their cigarettes. And the tobacco industry as a
whole will have to pay almost $14 million a year for a license to
do business in British Columbia. Prices would be controlled so the
companies cannot pass along the additional costs to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the tough laws, the province decided to sue the
tobacco companies for the costs of treating smokers who become ill.
Ms. Priddy estimates that it cost the province about $345 million a
year to treat tobacco-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Priddy, a former nurse, did not challenge the tobacco
companies' assertion that the lawsuit is an attempt by the province
to raise money. ``The lawsuit is only part of a broader strategy in
British Columbia to protect kids against tobacco, to recover health
care costs and to recover some dollars to allow us to do really
good prevention and cessation activities,'' Ms. Priddy said in an
interview in Toronto, which she visited to find support for the
British Columbia suit.

BOSNIA ECONOMY STILL AT MERCY OF POLITICAL LEADERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MIKE O'CONNOR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ Bosnian political leaders are so
good at resisting changes needed to revive the economy that
diplomats and foreign officials say their governments now face the
choice between providing large amounts of financial aid for years
and watching the country collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after the Dayton peace agreement, diplomats had
assumed that foreign private investment would have begun to replace
the $1.5 billion in annual foreign aid. But, with the ravages of
war still very obvious and an economy still run by communist-era
rules, doing business in Bosnia remains so unattractive that there
is very little foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   It takes 33,000 foreign troops to keep a new war at bay, and
Bosnia's various governments are held in place only with the daily
prodding of hundreds of foreign diplomats and experts. Similarly,
the economy survives in large part on international aid and the
money spent to support foreign organizations and tens of thousands
of foreigners working here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We urge, we push, we organize meetings, we threaten,'' said
Didier Fau, his face contorting slightly with the frustration of
being one of the top foreign officials responsible for Bosnia's
economic reform. ``But we are not in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone with the power to change the system benefits from the
way the system works now, so there is no reason for them to want
change,'' said a Western diplomat, referring to the small group of
politicians who control much of the economy through their control
of government.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think we can't afford to fail and we'll just keep
paying,'' the diplomat said. ``Maybe they are right.''
</P>
<P>
   Only three big foreign firms have ventured into Bosnia, and even
their commitment is tentative. Volkswagen, which had operated a
large plant just outside Sarajevo that was commandeered and wrecked
by the Bosnian Serbs during the 1992-95 war, is opening a
much-scaled-down operation. With some 400 workers, it will assemble
the final 10 percent of the Skoda cars made at the company's plants
in the Czech Republic. German diplomats said it took two years of
pressure to persuade the company to return to Bosnia. Coca-Cola has
a bottling venture in Bosnia, and DHL operates a courier service.
But both could fold quickly if they needed to get out,
businesspeople said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the other foreign businesspeople in Bosnia seem to be
motivated less by profit than emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Le Roch has his office across from the marketplace where a
mortar shell killed 68 people on Feb. 5, 1994. Le Roch was a French
Army officer with the United Nations in Bosnia then. Now his
business is to advise European companies interested in setting up
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, in three years, two companies that I work with, small
companies, have started up,'' he said. The problem, he said, is
that foreign investors find it is too hard to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1996 we had 160 delegations come from important businesses
who wanted to start something here,'' Le Roch said. ``Last year 97
delegations, this year we won't even reach 25. This country now has
a bad reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaders, on all sides, have learned the words to use,'' he
said. ``Free enterprise, Western style, market economy, dynamic,
efficient. They say these things with great passion. But that is
only superficial, nothing has changed from when this was a
communist country.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people in business or government here grew up in communist
Yugoslavia's unique economic system, which mixed Marxist planning
with alleged self-management of enterprises and was heavily
subsidized by the West, which wanted to keep the country out of the
Soviet orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Failing state-run companies in Bosnia received loans from a
state-run bank that kept them going and were never meant to be
repaid. The economy was largely a mirage, but its managers mouthed
the jargon and insisted that they practiced an enlightened mix of
Communism and capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   In similar fashion, today's Bosnian politicians refuse to
provide the kind of business environment that most large foreign
investors demand. Foreign economists working to try to open the
Bosnian economy say there is often favoritism in the way taxes and
laws are applied, so that a business can find itself penalized
while a competitor with a friend in the government gets help. They
say the lack of a commercial bank system or privatization also
keeps investors away.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of helping investors, diplomats and foreign economists
say, Bosnian political leaders allow, and often profit from,
corruption, tax evasion, and regulations so burdensome that
companies often must bribe officials, or break the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no senior leader from any group who says it is time
to move off a welfare economy to a productive economy,'' said the
U.S. ambassador to Bosnia, Richard Kauzlarich. ``Privatization has
been delayed, private initiative has been discouraged. People here
need to realize that their future will not be financed by the
international community.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no shortage of other places for investors to go in
this region,'' said Saumya Mitra, deputy director of the World Bank
in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Even with American government experts in place in Bosnian
banking regulatory agencies, Bosnian officials managed secretly to
sell off seven government-owned banks, probably illegally, foreign
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Many diplomats confess that they doubt the problems can be fixed
before their governments give up hope. For all the foreign aid and
technical assistance received, and promises of reform made by
Bosnian officials, most workers still do not have jobs and only 30
percent of the prewar industrial capacity has been revived.
</P>
<P>
   Some countries are starting programs they hope will foster free
enterprise. The European Union is shifting about $350 million from
programs to help refugees return to programs intended to help
develop the private sector, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has a $278 million loan program for Bosnian
businesses, part of a $766 million reconstruction project. In
addition, the Pentagon estimates that it is costing about $2
billion a year to keep U.S. forces here.
</P>
<P>
   The United States pays $25 million a year for programs giving
technical advice on new laws and regulations intended to open the
economy to investment. These allowed the deputy minister of foreign
trade, Seadeta Ceric, to say: ``Our economy is now very open and
very friendly for foreign investments. No one should have any
problems here.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said an American investor who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. ``Every permit is a nightmare,'' the investor said.
``New regulations appear overnight and get applied retroactively.
Every official has his hand out. I'm making money, but it's all off
the books so the government can't find it, because they would take
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Le Roch, who now _ in despair _ counsels foreign investors to
look elsewhere, said: ``I will survive. The people here, they will
survive, somehow. But is this what we fought for _ a crippled
country?''

AS GOING GETS TOUGH, HILLARY CLINTON SOARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.J.)  (lb) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As a withering year draws to a close with her
husband's threatened impeachment, Hillary Rodham Clinton prevails
above the American landscape in all her signature duality.
</P>
<P>
   There she is, darkly scored once more as the obsessive footnote
in the persistent Whitewater investigation of Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel who ardently wants Congress to impeach
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there she is, too, reigning brightly on the cover of Vogue
magazine _ the first time a first lady has been so honored, and a
decision mandated, the editors say, by Mrs. Clinton's exuberant,
triumphant campaign barnstorming to defend the careers of Democrats
in Congress and thereby her husband.
</P>
<P>
   In weathering a trying year, Mrs. Clinton has taken on an
unexpected political heft that even some Republicans have to
acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give her credit for getting her arms around this thing,'' said
Rich Galen, the strategist for House Republicans who thinks the
first lady has progressed smartly beyond her early errors, which
Republicans once gleefully exploited. ``She learned the lesson that
she couldn't be co-president. She stoically went through the Monica
stuff and has come out shining _ and come out swinging. She's
become the one beacon of light in the entire administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever her personal scars, Democrats gratefully note that Mrs.
Clinton managed to repair her popular standing through the very
role she once mocked as that of a one-dimensional spouse: standing
by her man. But she did so by brandishing her strength in
issue-oriented politics as a campaign tonic for all the lurid
wallowing that marked the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Hillary, it's the best of times and the worst of times,''
said George Stephanopoulos, the television commentator and former
White House political strategist. ``She is the key to the strange
success of this year. If at any moment she had winked or hinted at
any real distance between her and the president, then that's it,
the president loses.''
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the combativeness trumpeted by Mrs. Clinton herself in
the stunning first days of the president's sex scandal last January
remains the keynote for both Clintons 10 months later as a skittish
Congress labors to close out the impeachment struggle.
</P>
<P>
   By seizing the hustings as her personal outlet in a catastrophic
year, Mrs. Clinton has become widely hailed as the year's surprise
politician _ the most dominant popular campaigner in the November
elections that cut the Republican majority in Congress and toppled
such Clinton antagonists as Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia and
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have just witnessed the first step in the independent
life she is more likely to lead after this is all over,'' Doris
Kearns Goodwin, the historian steeped in the struggles of Eleanor
Roosevelt, said of Mrs. Clinton's ability to forge a political
identity beyond her charismatic, wayward husband. ``Hillary Clinton
showed a certain kind of strength under enormous pressure, an
ability to keep her public persona strong and classy while all the
turmoil was going on about her.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are qualities needed in public life. Maybe it's going to
be her turn next.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats already speculate on whether she might eventually
run for the Senate _ her campaign popularity was high in her home
state of Illinois _ and so truly prevail beyond her husband and his
harrowing incumbency.
</P>
<P>
   Such heady talk is remarkable considering how she was the first
lady once demonized by critics as the unelected overreacher when
her early health-care effort failed. Talk-radio conservatives have
long delighted in finding her ambitious hand in such haunting
issues as Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, now Hillary has become the Wronged Woman and has the
sympathy factor, which is something everybody is much more
comfortable with than the strong, determined Hillary,'' said
Arianna Huffington, a conservative columnist, fascinated by the
first lady's resilience at the side of her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Huffington measured the upturn in Mrs. Clinton's popularity
even before the sex scandal, the columnist said, ``when she
abandoned the tough issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, Ms. Huffington said, retreated to more
traditional helpmate projects, including children's issues, a
premillennial touring in behalf of national heritage, and her new
book, ``Dear Socks, Dear Buddy: Kids' Letters to the First Pets.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton remains in overdrive after her 19-state tour of
speaking relentlessly for scores of Democratic candidates. She is
currently touring Latin America, with special attention to
hurricane-ravaged areas, and has national-heritage trips planned to
New York, Boston and California, before she heads to the Middle
East with the president next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody, save perhaps her husband, shrugs off public
humiliation as elegantly as Mrs. Clinton,'' concluded The
Economist, the British weekly with a special eye for the United
States. The first lady was hailed by the weekly as both ``the most
ruthless of her husband's spin doctors'' and his most enduring
defender.
</P>
<P>
   Some Clintonites still rue her reported dominance in the White
House's early opposition to an out-of-court settlement in the Paula
Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit _ the fuse that lit the
sex-and-mendacity scandal now before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But they bless her steely performance since then in contending
that the problem was rooted in some ``vast right-wing conspiracy,''
and not in the president's outright denial of sexual dalliance
about which he finally had to admit misleading the nation. Clinton
also said he misled his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the year unfolded, Hillary found this inner strength,''
said Anna Wintour, editor in chief of Vogue, explaining why the
story was put on the cover. ``I think she psychs herself into this
battle mode and goes forward, not looking right or left. She told
us she doesn't even read the newspapers.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Vogue display coincided with Starr's latest Whitewater
indictment of Webster Hubbell, the former Justice Department
official and law partner of Mrs. Clinton in Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady was repeatedly referred to in the indictment as
the Hubbell ``billing partner.'' This was an echo of the
confrontation three years ago when a carefully composed Mrs.
Clinton had to walk past a throng of journalists to go before a
grand jury in Starr's unsuccessful attempt to implicate her in
Whitewater crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary Rodham Clinton is not the kind of woman those men
understand,'' Ms. Wintour said of the Starr investigators'
frustration in trying to single out the first lady, only to see her
become the pillar in the president's job-approval rating.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who was re-elected with the aid of
Mrs. Clinton, recalled the power of the first lady's several
campaign visits at some of the worst moments of the year for the
Clintons. ``She had the courage to face the cameras, a courage that
brought a lot of people to their feet,'' Boxer said. ``Her special
quality is to see a larger picture than the daily travail of
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli, the Senate Democratic campaign chairman,
studied Mrs. Clinton closely in her tour and prized her passion for
the task. ``You could see the strain on her,'' Torricelli said.
``But what is most remarkable is that there was no one even close
to being in demand like Hillary Rodham Clinton as a campaigner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something powerful has taken place,'' he said of Mrs. Clinton
as the resurgent campaigner.
</P>
<P>
   The hecklers still dog her with signs (``Queen of Denial''). But
the senator found them no match for the ``enormous satisfaction''
he saw in the first lady's avid return to such major issues as
Social Security, health care and education as she lambasted
Republicans who drove her from the debating scene four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary Clinton represents for so many Americans the problems
and struggles in their own lives,'' Torricelli said. ``She's
obviously a symbol for my generation of people with deep personal
problems in complex times. And she has survived.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator thinks Mrs. Clinton has survived as a gifted
politician, one who could find her own constituency beyond her
husband's time. ``I wouldn't want to be the Republican candidate to
oppose her,'' he said.

 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ While their counterparts in Congress were steeped
in the impeachment hearings last week, the nation's Republican
governors gathered here, happily oblivious to the biggest political
story in Washington. Most of them did not even tune in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been here three days and I have not heard one governor
mention those hearings,'' said Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, who
served in the House for 12 years. ``I have not heard an
utterance.''
</P>
<P>
   North Dakota Gov. Edward Schafer said he glimpsed only a snippet
of the hearings on television from the vantage point of an exercise
bike _ and that that was more than enough. ``We all have business
to do, and states to run and politics to conduct,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At times last week, it seemed hard to believe that the governors
and members of Congress were even from the same party.
</P>
<P>
   As those attending the annual meeting of the Republican
Governors Association in New Orleans exchanged success stories
about their landslide victories, back in Washington recriminations
continued over the party's loss of House seats.
</P>
<P>
   As the governors quizzed one another about improving school
reading programs, House Republicans gently quizzed Kenneth Starr
about a scandal these governors wish would go away.
</P>
<P>
   And as several governors seemed surprisingly willing (at least
in private conversations) to practically anoint one of their own,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, as the next Republican presidential
nominee, the party's congressional wing was struggling to patch up
the internal discord that led to the toppling of House Speaker Newt
Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, the New Orleans meeting was a cry for
recognition: The Republican governors want credit for dominating
the governorships; in January, there will be 31 Republican
governors. They want a bigger role in setting the tone and national
agenda for the Republican Party. And they are irritated that
Republicans in Washington stood by as the Democrats held them
responsible for being obsessed with scandal _ and not interested in
improving education or health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shrill voices and sitting down and doing no more simply
doesn't cut it at the state level,'' said Oklahoma Gov. Frank
Keating , the incoming chairman of the governors' association, in a
barbed reference to congressional Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   New York Gov. George Pataki said the prescription for the party
was basic. ``What we have to do as a party is to have a positive
agenda of change,'' he said. ``In the states, we did. But I didn't
see that coming out of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should go down and ask for their ear,''
Pataki said. ``I think we should have a pro-active positive agenda
for the future of our states and the country that we present to the
administration and congressional leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   The governors took their concerns to a closed-door session with
the incoming House speaker, Bob Livingston of Louisiana, who spoke
to them by satellite on Wednesday, after he was elected, and to
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, who was in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   And Saturday, Ridge, who declared that ``the year 2000 is
fraught with opportunity and peril for the party,'' convened a
meeting here of governors, members of the Republican National
Committee from around the country and the party's most successful
fund-raisers in a drive to broaden the governors' portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress, pointedly, were not invited.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the midterm election results seemed only to
accentuate the strain between Republican congressional leaders and
the governors. ``We lost seats in the Congress; that creates a
tension,'' said Utah Gov. Michael Leavitt. ``We just had a change
in leadership; that creates a tension. Everyone is now evaluating
the direction they think the party should go; that creates a
tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a nervousness on the part of congressional leaders as
well as a sense of anxiety and anticipation among the governors.
Governors have a very important contribution to make; we just have
to figure out how to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   The governors and other Republican leaders were all smiles as
they assembled around a horseshoe-shaped table at one session. But
beneath the surface, it was clear that all was not serene.
</P>
<P>
   At the head of the table was South Carolina Gov. David Beasley,
the outgoing chairman of the Republican Governors Association. He
found himself in the uncomfortable position of presiding over a
conference about the party's future and the governors' ``winning
message'' _ even though he was one of only two Republican governors
who lost _ and he faulted the national party's efforts to get
voters to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Seated to Beasley's left was Lott, whom some governors
criticized for not taking up a tax cut bill that the party's
candidates could have used in their campaigns. On Beasley's right
side was Republican National Committee chairman Jim Nicholson, who
is struggling to fight off a challenge from partisans trying to
oust him because of the disappointing election results. ( Nicholson
is up for re-election in January.)
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the table from Nicholson was Michigan Gov.
John Engler, who has publicly called for ``a stronger national
figure'' to replace Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   Schafer said of the election outcome: ``Everybody was pretty
civil, but it's always rough when you don't like the results. We
talked about the fact that we used to have a pretty good
relationship and that it diminished over the last couple of
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Though many governors complained that Lott slighted them at this
gathering last year, this time he praised ``the most outstanding
group of governors, maybe in the history of the country.'' He
invited the governors to meet with congressional leaders in
Washington early next month.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk of an improved dialogue, it was not evident
that governors will exert more influence in the party. Despite the
assurances by Livingston and Lott, many of the chief executives
here remember that at their meeting in Williamsburg, Va., only four
years ago, Gingrich had made similar overtures, only to shut them
out of deliberations over most issues except welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   Another hurdle for governors is that it is not easy to translate
a successful state agenda into a potent national theme. Though the
governors criticize their friends in Congress for having no agenda
and bending too much to the right, the reality is that governors
can often pursue a more moderate agenda because they are not
lobbied by interest groups as much as lawmakers in Washington are.
</P>
<P>
   It was not an encouraging omen that in his welcoming remarks to
the governors, Livingston made a minor gaffe, but one that did not
escape a roomful of governors who want to be taken more seriously.
He referred to 34 Republican governors who will be in office next
year. The correct number is 31.

   BRITAIN-LORDS (London) _ A more unlikely band of guerrillas
cannot be imagined than the ermine-caped members of Britain's House
of Lords. But in a series of rebellious acts this month, the
venerable senior body has blocked passage of a key government bill
and vowed to sabotage legislative procedures to keep the disputed
measure from becoming law when a new parliamentary session opens
next week. By Warren Hoge.

   BOSNIA-ECON (Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina) _ Bosnian political

   RUSSIA-ASSASSINATION (Moscow) _ The killing Friday night in St.
Petersburg of Galina Starovoitova, a leading liberal politician and
tireless defender of Russia's democratic reforms, shocked her old
allies who claimed her as the latest victim of the country's
lethally corrupt political climate. President Boris Yeltsin
dispatched his top law-enforcement officials to investigate the

been his close associate during the early years of Russia's
transition from Communism to democracy, and served as his adviser
on inter-ethnic affairs. By Celestine Bohlen.

   NIGERIA-REBELS (Ojobo, Nigeria) _ Long-simmering resentments
that have finally reached the boil of outright rebellion in the
delta, an oil-rich region that produces 90 percent of Nigeria's
hard-currency earnings but itself lacks roads, electricity and even
running water. In recent weeks, Orubebe and other members of the
Ijaw ethnic group took control of about 20 oil stations belonging
to Royal/Dutch Shell and Chevron, at one point cutting Nigeria's
oil production of two million barrels a day by a third. By

BRIGHTEST KIDS IN LAUSD NOT SERVED, MANY SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY TERRI HARDY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- For years, a group of parents and teachers have
lobbied for funds to launch a program to help some of the LAUSD's
most forgotten students -- the best and brightest.
</P>
<P>
   Banking on promises that the district would spend $2.5 million
to open centers for its gifted students, parents rejoiced when a
$71 million windfall arrived this year. But then came the shocker
-- the gifted centers didn't make the superintendent's wish list.
The final injustice, they say, came last week when parents weren't
even allowed to speak when the board was deciding how to spend the
extra money.
</P>
<P>
   For the 50,000 LAUSD students identified as gifted, there's only
space for 7,000 very bright children at magnet campuses. Others are
given tougher math and reading books for self-study at home, but
are forced to sit through classes below their level.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, board members have told us that they would help us
if they had the money. Well, now they have the funds. Our kids have
waited too long -- this is our time,'' said Carol Knee, chairwoman
of the district's advisory gifted and highly gifted committee, a
group of parents and community leaders that has worked for three
years to improve the system's education system for very bright
students.
</P>
<P>
   When a San Fernando Valley elementary school bluntly told Lisa
Leonoudakis last year that it was unable to properly educate her
highly gifted daughter, the West Hills mother said she was ``forced
to flee'' Los Angeles Unified and enroll her child in a private
school.
</P>
<P>
   Leonoudakis, like thousands of other parents, have anxiously
awaited the promised opening in 1999 of new academic centers in the
LAUSD for their gifted children -- a promise that is now in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It appears that the centers are the latest victims in the
district budget wars, where employee unions are pressuring the
board to use the surplus for a salary hike.
</P>
<P>
   Board members and LAUSD staff members caution that they have yet
to make any final decisions. But George Kiriyama, a board member
who chairs the LAUSD's instruction committee, said the proposal for
the centers is not a high-profile project and has yet to be
discussed by his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Kiriyama said he is relying on Superintendent Ruben Zacarias to
outline instruction priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't do it all. He's got to say what stays and what
goes,'' Kiriyama said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed 30 centers for 2,500 children would serve as
demonstration sites, with the goal to implement similar programs at
schools throughout the district. Several colleges, including the
University of California, Los Angeles, the University of Southern
California and Johns Hopkins University had volunteered to
implement and design curriculum and teacher training.
</P>
<P>
   The idea proposes at least three schools to be placed in each of
the LAUSD's nine regional areas, but sites have yet to be selected.
Campuses would be an elementary, middle and high school, all
feeding into each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every child should have an opportunity to achieve up to their
ability, but it's obvious that this is not a priority with the
LAUSD,'' Knee said. ``Some parents already have decided to move
their children to private schools, but some people don't have that
option. As a public school system, the LAUSD should be looking
after the needs of all of its children.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan had been to spend $2.5 million to train teachers and
set up the centers modeled on the district's successful magnet
programs, but without their complex application and admission
process. Last year, the district spent $5.5 million on its gifted
students, as opposed to the $689 million on special education _ a
program that is now under a consent decree because the courts
determined the LAUSD had failed to educate those students properly.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent board meeting where members discussed how to divide
the state windfall, there was no mention of the academic centers
and Knee and her group were not allowed to speak. The board's
actions raised concerns among the gifted-talented committee members
that the matter was off the table completely.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Valerie Fields said while she supports the academic
centers, it is unclear how much money is actually available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until there is a firm grip on how much money there is I can't
vote on any of this stuff,'' Fields said, although she did vote to
approve about $20 million in programs during the budget talks.
Fields also has said she is supportive of a raise for teachers.
</P>
<P>
   John Liechty, assistant superintendent for the division of
instruction, said Zacarias has assured him that he supports the
academic centers and believes it will go to the board before the
end of the year. But Liechty, who has worked with the
gifted-talented advisory committee for years, told the group at a
recent meeting that he too is frustrated by the board's failure to
act.
</P>
<P>
   ``This all has to do with salary negotiations,'' Liechty told
the group. ``I wish I could tell you the politics don't play a part
in education, but it does.''

<P>
   OJOBO, Nigeria _ Deep in the mangrove swamp of the Niger River
Delta, Bello Orubebe pressed his nose against the window of a
deserted houseboat once used by Shell oil workers. Peeking inside,
he saw a simple room the size of a big closet, with bunk beds,
metal lockers, an air-conditioner and a fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside there,'' he said, ``you have the best facilities you
can think of. The best of everything you need. We, the people of
the delta, have nothing. The international community must know that
in Nigeria, there is a place called the Niger Delta that produces
the country's oil, and we are abused and exploited.''
</P>
<P>
   Orubebe, 32, who describes himself as a revolutionary, was
giving voice to long-simmering resentments that have finally
reached the boil of outright rebellion in the delta, an oil-rich
region that produces 90 percent of Nigeria's hard-currency earnings
but itself lacks roads, electricity and even running water.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Orubebe and other members of the Ijaw ethnic
group took control of about 20 oil stations belonging to
Royal/Dutch Shell and Chevron, at one point cutting Nigeria's oil
production of 2 million barrels a day by a third.
</P>
<P>
   Ten of Shell's sites remain in the hands of young Ijaw men, who
also control the hundreds of creeks and Niger River tributaries
that lace the region and provide its only means of access. A week
and a half ago, some Ijaw invaded an offshore oil rig belonging to
Texaco and held eight employees, including three Americans, hostage
over five days.
</P>
<P>
   Hostage-taking and bitter complaint are not new to this
desperately poor and disgruntled area of Africa's most populous
country. But the recent acts of rebellion and the disruption they
have caused to the flow of this country's lifeblood have rarely
posed so grave a risk to stability. This is particularly so as the
country staggers through an uncertain democratic transition.
</P>
<P>
   At the root of the resentment are nothing less than power and
money. While the largely Christian south is the source of Nigeria's
oil, profits from the industry go to the Muslim north. It has
lubricated gross levels of corruption there among the generals who
have ruled Nigeria for all but four of the last 32 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, isolated acts against oil installations typically
resulted from particular communities' grievances toward a local oil
station, industry officials said. But the spread of the rebellion
across such a vast territory, especially in the western delta,
suggests that the actions are better organized than before and are
intended to convey a broader message to the central government.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that there's been an escalation,'' Tom
Schull, general manager of production for Chevron's Nigerian
operations, said of the unrest. ``The frustration of the people
living in the delta in the past was between host communities and
the oil companies. There has been a change recently. They're using
us to express their frustrations against the federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   So far the government, which is involved in joint ventures with
all the Western oil companies, has refrained from using force to
stop the unrest. Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, who took over as
president after the sudden death of Gen. Sani Abacha in June, has
urged negotiations with the leaders of the rebellion and last week
went on a tour of the eastern delta.
</P>
<P>
   If the Ijaw represent those most directly affected by a system
of neglect based in the north, their anger is also shared by the
south's two major ethnic groups, the Ibo and Yoruba.
</P>
<P>
   But the region's poverty is also cause for ethnic division.
Rising violence between groups competing for oil jobs has left
scores dead around the oil town of Warri, which is under a
dusk-to-dawn curfew. And in October, not far from Warri, more than
700 people died after an attempt to siphon fuel illegally from a
pipeline set off a devastating fireball.
</P>
<P>
   The Ijaw in particular have taken aim at the Western oil
companies, which generate some $10 billion a year in revenue for
the Nigerian government and have made Nigeria the world's
sixth-largest oil producer. They have demanded that some of that
oil money be returned to the delta to build roads, and provide
electricity, running water and medical outlets. And there is talk,
albeit vague, of secession and self-determination if their demands
are not met.
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar, who has won praise in the West as a reformer, has at
least acknowledged the existence of problems here. This month he
allowed public rallies commemorating the 1995 hanging of Ken
Saro-Wiwa, a delta writer who was executed after demanding
reparations for the region.
</P>
<P>
   The general has also pledged to overhaul the agency charged with
developing the delta for its 7 million inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   Shell's complex here, a ``flow'' station called Benisede, was
one of the first to be seized. According to Shell, about 35,000
barrels of crude were pumped every day from more than 20 wells in
the area, and the oil flowed through a maze of pipelines into
Benisede. The company is Nigeria's largest oil investor, pumping
more than half of the 2 million barrels that Western companies take
out of the country each day.
</P>
<P>
   In August, a group of Ijaw from a neighboring village took eight
Shell workers hostage for a week, and the station has been closed
since then, said Albert Aramabi, the external relations manager for
Shell's operations in the western Niger Delta. Aramabi said that
Shell was negotiating with the Ijaw over the release of its
stations, but that disagreements among some Ijaw were hampering
talks.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the Ijaw occupying Shell flow stations were
generally armed, although on a recent visit to Benisede, the 20
young men there carried no weapons. Clad in T-shirts and shorts,
they moved comfortably around the station in flip-flops or bare
feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until our demands are met, we will stay here,'' said Eric
Ekereke, 28, who like almost everyone occupying the station is an
unemployed villager from Ojobo. ``We are very, very angry. While we
are suffering, they are enjoying themselves here. They have
constant power and water supply here, A.C. all around.
Telecommunications to London, to anywhere in the world.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To the young men, everything at the station seemed a source of
bitterness, the vague symbol of some personal injury: the
helicopter landing pad that allowed Shell workers to fly in and out
of the area; the station's two gas flares that once lit up the
night sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we stopped them,'' Orubebe said, ``light at the flow
station had been continuous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Continuous!'' chimed in a local leader, Chief Zaria Torukro.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do not give us light, we will extinguish yours,''
Orubebe said.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent night, he and several other young men gathered at
Torukro's house, sitting around two kerosene lamps on the front
porch. The rank smells of stagnant water and untreated sewage clung
to the air, as it did in other houses, alleyways and every
breezeless corner.
</P>
<P>
   The village's generator was not working that night. Besides, it
was unlikely that the power would reach Torukro's house, which was
a good hike from the riverbank and down a muddy, flooded road in
the mangrove swamp. The chief, 70, a retired schoolteacher, offered
visitors warm bottles of Coke.
</P>
<P>
   ``The development of the people is the responsibility of the
federal government,'' said Torukro, frequently and loudly, swatting
at the mosquitoes that dared to land on his chest and back. ``We
are angry at the government, too. But we are angrier at Shell,
because Shell is here.''
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with that widely held sentiment, residents of Ojobo
tend to describe the days before Shell's arrival in the early 1970s
as a halcyon age of clear river water and bountiful fish and game.
</P>
<P>
   They accuse Shell of having polluted the water so that the
village must supplement its catch with frozen mackerel from Warri.
By the time the mackerel arrives in this fishing village, wrapped
in plastic bags and sold on the riverbank, it has doubled in price,
several traders said.
</P>
<P>
   Gray D'Oroso, 48, the village's chief administrator, said that
big animals, including antelopes and leopards, used to inhabit the
area. His father was a famous hunter, D'Oroso said, adding that the
trade disappeared by the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last famous hunter was College Molori,'' D'Oroso said.
``He left Ojobo 15 or 16 years ago, and now he lives in Gabon.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether all that has befallen Ojobo since Shell's arrival can be
attributed to it is not clear. What is clear is that, given the
scant presence here of the federal government, Shell is the most
visible symbol of the neglect that plagues the region. Residents
have turned to the company for compensation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 Shell built a potable-water system that residents said
has never worked. Instead, in the morning, villagers could be seen
using the muddy river to bathe, wash clothes, clean food and even
drink. Others living deeper in the swamp simply used the water
flooding the dirt roads between their mud-and-thatch houses.
</P>
<P>
   Aramabi of Shell said a contract to repair the water system had
been awarded recently. Had it not been for the occupation of the
Shell site, he said, residents here would probably have potable
water now. He added that the company had just awarded another
contract to fill a flooded area of the village with sand.
</P>
<P>
   Shell spends $30 million a year in ``community development''
projects in the delta, far more than any other oil company spends
on any other area of the world, Aramabi said. But he added that
only lasting political reforms in Nigeria would lead to real
improvements in the delta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever we throw in is still a drop in the ocean,'' Aramabi
said. ``The riverine communities are crying out for development.
But if one looks closely at them, the level of development required
goes well beyond the capacity of the oil industry. The government
should take the lead.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It was Saturday night at the Providence-Mount St.
Vincent nursing home. Marie Swegle, 96, and her friends on the
fifth floor were lingering at the dinner table in their
wheelchairs, watching the news. John Glenn had safely returned to
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Swegle, who a year before had learned to walk again after
falling and breaking her neck, was not overly impressed by the
77-year-old astronaut. Neither was Effie Constantine, at 67 a good
15 years younger than anyone else at the table but crippled by
hydrocephalus. ``It's a waste of money, sending him up in space,''
she said. ``Why don't they spend the money to study aging on
earth?''
</P>
<P>
   One place to start such a study might be at Providence-Mount St.
Vincent, a five-story building surrounded by gardens at the top of
a hill overlooking Elliott Bay. The Mount, as those who live there
call it, is widely regarded to be what many Americans consider an
impossibility: a good nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   That is to say, in an industry freighted with the dread of old
age, disability and loneliness, and periodically tainted by scandal
and abuse, the Mount has found ways to be a home to people who can
no longer care for themselves, to provide a sense of community in a
place where no one wants to be, to be a community that is more
about living than about dying.
</P>
<P>
   The Mount is a place where Mrs. Swegle finds life sweet enough
that she talks about wanting to make it to 100, where her friend
down the hall, Vivian Grenfell, 83, who has a painful bone disease,
looks forward to Fridays because that is when staff members help
her put on her bathing suit and take her to a neighborhood pool so
they can help her move her arms and legs in the water. Swimming is
making her stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Grenfell, a retired dressmaker, belongs to a weekly ladies'
luncheon group at the Mount, serves on the ethics committee and
writes a column for its newspaper. Things were different at her
first nursing home, she said: ``You went in your room, you went in
your bed. You didn't do much of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   As well as the Mount works, though, it cannot alter the stark
realities of aging that its residents confront every day: the
spouses, friends and even children outlivedl; the physical
limitations; the loss of independence and control. These are men
and women who survived the Depression; who fought in World War II;
who worked as farmers, teachers, office managers, bus drivers and
engineers; who raised families and ran houses; who now need help to
go to the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Each floor of the Mount is divided in half, one side nursing
home, the other assisted-living apartments for less-dependent
residents. While some people come here, get well and return home,
for most the Mount is the last address. ``It's the end of the
road,'' said 84-year-old Ruth Skoog, who grew up, graduated from
high school, got married and raised a family in West Seattle at the
bottom of the hill, and now, after two strokes, has arrived in Room
317 at the top.
</P>
<P>
   The nursing home's population of 215 men and women is similar to
that of most nursing homes: the sickest and most severely disabled
elderly. The average age is 88. Eighty percent of the residents
suffer from some degree of dementia.
</P>
<P>
   When you are at the Mount, most of what staff members do day in
and day out hardly seems extraordinary. The aides, nurses and
social workers keep the residents clean and fed, take time to talk
and to listen, and treat everyone _ even the most demented _ with
respect and dignity. They enliven the atmosphere with the stuff of
ordinary life: plants, pets, pictures on the wall, visits from
children. This being Seattle, there is a coffee bar. The old enjoy
a cup of latte, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not rocket science,'' said Kevin Bail, a social worker
who oversees the fifth floor. ``It's basic stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   As nursing homes change and adapt under the pressure of managed
care and Medicaid rules, even the visionary administrator behind
the Mount, Robert Ogden, says it would be preferable for nursing
homes to cease to exist _ for people to be able to remain at home
or in some other setting in their community. And alternatives are
increasingly available.
</P>
<P>
   But meanwhile, with nearly half of all Americans who reach 65
expected to spend time in a nursing home, health care professionals
are looking to the Mount and a handful of places like it for
answers.
</P>
<P>
   Its current administrator, Charlene Boyd, says there is no
reason the Mount cannot be duplicated. Money is a factor, she
acknowledged; at about $60,000 a year, the Mount costs about
$10,000 more than the national average. Yet half of its residents
depend on Medicaid. More important is breaking free of rigid rules
and routines that assume residents are helpless.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Mount is the last community for most of its
residents, what is possible within a limited budget? How good can
the end of the road be?
</P>
<P>
   The Condition: Aging Residents Live with Pain and Loss
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a dilapidating disease,'' Vivian Grenfell's roommate,
Effie Constantine, was explaining to a visitor.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Grenfell corrected her: ``You mean debilitating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right, debilitating _ that sounds better,'' Mrs. Constantine
said. ``But I feel dilapidated.''
</P>
<P>
   They are all, in one way or another, debilitated and
dilapidated, cut down by strokes, heart disease, Parkinson's,
arthritis, osteoporosis, cancer, dementia and the sheer advance of
time, dependent on Digoxin, Darvocet, Trazodone, Paxil, Tylenol and
for calcium, nearly all of them, Tums. This is the condition that
awaits anyone who lives long enough. And with the rapid growth in
the 85-and-over population, it is a condition that increasing
numbers of people will know. More than 1.5 million Americans live
in nursing homes now.
</P>
<P>
   Frances Mara was talking recently about how her father died of
influenza in 1918, before he reached 40. Mrs. Mara, who spends her
days alone in her room watching CNN, got her annual flu shot a few
weeks ago. She is 84.
</P>
<P>
   Though her hands are so bent and stiff from arthritis that she
can no longer do the sewing she once enjoyed, a condition that no
doubt contributes to her depression, Mrs. Mara never fails to vote,
even if she needs help holding the pen to mark her absentee ballot.
Voter turnout is high at the Mount.
</P>
<P>
   But these survivors, many of them stoical in the face of
enormous pain and loss, win no honor from a society that promotes
longevity but denies death and shuns its emissaries, the frail
elderly. ``I see people back away from them when we go on trips,''
said Laurie Thode, a recreational coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   They are not the so-called active senior generation, the
attractive silver-haired people celebrated in the media playing
golf and going on cruises. The lucky ones among them are those who
can walk, with walkers, and those who, as the residents put it,
``have all their marbles.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to lump them together: a group of men and women in
wheelchairs, a few staring vacantly, others nodding off. Even those
who are fully aware are often unable, because of impairments, to
show by their expressions or gestures just how alive they are.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thode and other staff members take pains to point out each
individual. That 92-year old, the one moaning, ``oh dear, oh
dear,'' lived in a sod house in Alaska with her husband during
World War II. The 81-year-old whose stroke left her struggling to
utter a sentence? She once was an international toastmistress. The
83-year-old tethered to a feeding tube, who on some days doesn't
know where he is, happens to be a much-loved husband and father,
who last week sat clutching a letter from his son, telling how his
seventh-grade son had just gone to his first school dance with a
girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me, how do you do this work day in and day out?''
said Susan Scully, the social worker on the second floor. She tells
them she enjoys the residents, and she means it _ speaking as a
social worker. ``Things would be different,'' she said, ``if they
were my parents.''

<P>
   The Approach: Respect, Dignity Guide Care at the Mount
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning: The weekly meeting of the third-floor residents
was in session in the bird room, a cozy lounge with plush carpeting
and big windows and an aviary.
</P>
<P>
   Karla Heath, the registered nurse who oversees the floor, wanted
to know if anyone had a complaint. How were the meals? Were they
getting up in the morning when they wanted? What about the
activities?
</P>
<P>
   The finches were chirping away. The 11 people present _ about a
fourth of the floor _ were mostly quiet, as usual. Rose Wilson, 81,
did not breathe a word about the third-floor cat, Kit, who had
singled out her bed for his afternoon naps; Mrs. Wilson hates cats.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just that the residents are mostly pleased with the
Mount, Ms. Heath would explain later. Most have already spent their
savings to pay for their care, and are on Medicaid; those who are
not will be in a matter of months. There is an underlying fear that
if they complain, they might lose the last piece of security they
have in the world: their beds here.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents have come from other nursing homes, where they
learned what it was like to wait 30 minutes or more for an aide to
respond to a call button for a bathroom emergency. (At the Mount,
aides must respond within three minutes.) ``I just think they are
very aware that they are dependent on others,'' Ms. Heath said.
</P>
<P>
   Pressing on, Ms. Heath asked the group, ``What about the food?
Are you getting what you want? It's OK to ask for something
different for breakfast.''
</P>
<P>
   Alice Berg, 90, who used to serve coffee and snacks on the state
ferry to Vashon Island, volunteered that she had requested toast
and orange juice that very morning. For Mrs. Berg, who daily
proclaims her delight in every aspect of the Mount, it was an
assertive step forward.
</P>
<P>
   Lois Boppell, 87, who was born with cerebral palsy and had a job
sorting bolts for Boeing, managed to get out, in her slurred
speech, that she would like more fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Lillian Reeder, 85, a retired elementary teacher with a bad
heart, also had a request: ``I would like more chopped up turkey,
chicken and beef. It's easier to swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider it done, Ms. Heath assured them.
</P>
<P>
   She ended the meeting with a pep talk: ``Everyone's going to go
out there and speak up more for what they want, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, the Mount was exactly the sort of place
everyone dreaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very traditional nursing home _ very institutional,
very cold,'' said Ogden, who became the administrator in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The Mount's nursing home was opened by the Sisters of Providence
in 1967, the beginning of a mass construction of nursing homes
across the country financed by a new federal health care program
for the poor, Medicaid. For lack of any other model, these new
institutions, something more than rest homes or old-age homes, were
patterned after hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   With Medicaid guaranteeing income, the care of the frail elderly
became big business. And the dramatic increase in longevity,
combined with the transformation in society brought by increasing
mobility and women going to work, meant a growing need for
institutional care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody ever used to think of putting their grandparents in a
nursing home,'' said Maureen Gladstone, 62, a nurse on the fifth
floor whose grandmother lived with her family when she was growing
up. ``She helped raise us. Then when she got older, we took care of
her.''
</P>
<P>
   In the old Mount, everything revolved around the staff members
and their schedules. The day shift arrived at 6 a.m. and started
getting everyone up for breakfast, whether they wanted to or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know any better,'' said Ogden, who is now a regional
director of long-term care and housing for the Sisters of
Providence. ``Our definition of care was to protect people to the
point where they had no freedom, no dignity. We didn't want them to
fall. We didn't want to be hurt by anything. The best thing we
could think of to do was to put them away.''
</P>
<P>
   State regulators gave the Mount top ratings. That was how things
worked in nursing homes, and how they still work in many.
</P>
<P>
   As speculators and profiteers rushed into the business,
conditions in the worst nursing homes led to scandals that helped
shape Americans' fear of nursing homes. The scandals also prompted
Congress to enact the 1987 Nursing Home Reform Law. Conditions
slowly began to improve. Some health professionals began to talk
about a new way of looking at nursing homes, one stressing the
quality of residents' lives.
</P>
<P>
   At the Mount, by then operated by the nonprofit Sisters of
Providence Health System, Ogden and his assistant, Charlene Boyd,
who has since succeeded him, began working with a team to carry out
the new philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Each floor was divided into ``neighborhoods'' of about 20
residents each with their own dining room and kitchen. Anyone could
get a snack or a cup of coffee at any time. White walls were
painted pastel shades and hung with art. Floors were carpeted.
</P>
<P>
   Residents were no longer automatically tied down at night in the
name of protecting them. ``The nurses came unglued,'' Ogden said.
``They said the patients might fall out of bed. Some did. We picked
them up and put them back. They slept better.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical diets calibrated down to the last gram of sugar and salt
were thrown out or modified. ``I went back to the docs and said,
`Does this really matter?' '' Ogden said. ``They said, `No, not if
you're 85.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Supervisory positions were eliminated and the money saved went
to hire more aides. For all the innovations, for all the plants,
pets and talk of vision, the success of the Mount comes down to the
aides. They are the ones who spend the most time with the
residents, bathing, dressing, feeding, changing and talking with
them.
</P>
<P>
   At night, Ruth Skoog turns to her aide, Gloria Alderman, for
comfort. ``I say, `Gloria sing me a song; I don't feel so good,' ''
Mrs. Skoog said the other evening as Ms. Alderman, who is a gospel
singer, fed her a dinner of pureed food, a necessity because of
Mrs. Skoog's bowel problems.
</P>
<P>
   In another nursing home, Mrs. Skoog might be classified as a
``feeder.'' To Ms. Alderman and the other aides, Mrs. Skoog is a
beauty queen; they all know she won the Miss West Seattle crown
when she was 18, and they see to it that her nails are manicured
and her lipstick is fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Aides at most nursing homes are paid little more than minimum
wage. The Mount pays about $10 an hour. But pay is just part of the
difference. Aides are trained in what the Mount calls
``resident-directed care'' _ what it means, how to make it work,
why the Mount believes in it.
</P>
<P>
   Every aide is part of a team that cares for a specific group of
residents. Other staff members, including nurses and social
workers, help them when they need help. And aides are recognized
throughout the year with gifts, special days and opportunities to
attend professional conferences. There is turnover _ about 30
percent a year _ but the average nursing home has 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the aides are from Africa and Southeast Asia. They all
comment that they never saw a nursing home until they came to
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have these kinds of facilities,'' said Tesfaye
Begosa, who is from Ethiopia. ``Whenever your parents get old, you
just take them to your place.''

<P>
   The Unconventional: Mixing Residents To End Hierarchy
</P>
<P>
   Everyone predicted disaster when Ogden decided to unlock the
56-bed Alzheimer's ward on the fourth floor and mix its residents
with everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty percent of the social workers walked out,'' said one
aide, Tamara Allen, who vehemently opposed the move but now is so
sold on the change that she gives speeches about it at conferences.
``We just couldn't imagine how it would be.''
</P>
<P>
   That there were problems with the old way, she could not deny.
In her trademark speech, she describes the caste system that still
operates in many nursing homes: ``Independent residents look down
on the residents that need help, and they in turn look down on the
residents who are confused.''
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Gladstone, the nurse, recalled the fears of ``the alerts
and non-agitateds'' _ jargon for those without dementia. ``I asked
them, `What is it about them that bothers you?' '' she said. ``They
were afraid they'd be that way. It's like a mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   But chaos did not erupt. On the contrary, Alzheimer's patients
became less agitated. When those who seemed likely to wander off
were fitted with ankle bracelets that would signal when they were
leaving, and through which door. ``They didn't seem to roam
around,'' Ms. Gladstone said. ``Just the idea that they could go
wherever they wanted _ they didn't want to anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlocking the fourth floor was an effort to eliminate the
hierarchy that defines most nursing homes, where floors are
organized by disability and impairment, forcing frail elderly
people who have already given up their homes and their communities
to move again as they decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was terrified of moving to the fourth floor,'' Ms.
Boyd said.
</P>
<P>
   A Dilemma: Balancing a Range Of People's Needs
</P>
<P>
   Vivian Grenfell and Marie Swegle were having dinner with five
other residents at their regular table on the fifth floor. The
conversation turned to a recent outing to the new Nordstrom's
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not exaggerating, it's the most beautiful store I've ever
seen,'' said Mrs. Swegle, who taught elementary school before she
was married, attends mass daily in the Mount's chapel and manages
to look regal in her neck brace and collar, accessorized with a
string of pearls. ``I saw a hat I liked. It had a turned-up brim,
and a little bit of red in it. My better sense told me I was
getting too old to buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another woman at the table, who has Alzheimer's, was focused on
the corn on her plate. ``I just love corn,'' she repeated several
times, with a radiant smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``She fits in beautifully,'' Effie Constantine had said earlier
of her tablemate.
</P>
<P>
   At another table, a woman with dementia whose tendency toward
foul language has made her something of an outcast was crying out:
``Help, I can't walk! Don't undress me! Help!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I'm very inadequate,'' she said imploringly to Tamara
Allen, the aide.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Allen put her arm around her and stroked her hair. ``You're
not,'' she said. ``You're fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Listened to night after night, the ravings of the unmoored have
become the background noise of the fifth floor, like the television
that is sometimes left on. Much of it, fortunately, is lost on
those residents who are hard of hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good thing they mixed in the Alzheimer's
people,'' Mrs. Swegle volunteered. She recalled a visit she made to
the old locked fourth floor. ``I went up to see a friend of mine,''
she said. ``It frightened me. One woman came at me with a stick.
It's because they had been shut up together for so long. I think it
got on their nerves. It's better to be out.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my neighbors came down with Alzheimer's,'' she added.
``She's here. I see her every once in a while. She makes very
sensible remarks.''
</P>
<P>
   Things have been more difficult on the third floor, where
87-year-old Maxine Christian's dementia causes her to moan and cry
out continually.
</P>
<P>
   ``What am I going to do about Maxine?'' Ms. Heath said the other
day in exasperation. She had tried changes in medication, lab tests
that might detect a physical problem, music, a rocking chair, art
projects with a recreational coordinator, Niki Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Heath had spent hours trying to comfort Mrs. Christian.
``What's wrong, Maxine?'' she had asked her, over and over. Mrs.
Christian, a former artist who can no longer paint, and whose son
died of leukemia at age 45, never had an answer.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Heath said she wished she could give Mrs. Christian a
private room, in part to spare her roommate, but private rooms are
few and hard to come by at the Mount. In an ideal world, she said,
everyone in a nursing home could have a private room.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ms. Heath had summoned Mrs. Christian's husband of 60 years,
Ed. Seated at a table in her office, the 86-year-old retired
electrician wept as she told him she had to think of the 40 other
residents on the floor. ``She's disrupting the community,'' she
said. When it comes to Mrs. Christian, apparently, the residents
are not shy about complaining. ``They're all saying, `Can't you do
something?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is she the worst one you've ever had?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The answer was no. Ms. Heath, her own eyes watering, put her
hand on his arm.
</P>
<P>
   A week or so later, with still no improvement, Ms. Heath said
one solution, which she was not crazy about, might be to increase
Mrs. Christian's anti-anxiety medication. She did not want to
consider the other alternative, discharging Mrs. Christian and
leaving her husband to find another nursing home. ``We're just
going to have to make it work,'' she said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The Adjustment: A New Life, With Ups and Downs
</P>
<P>
   Adjusting to a nursing home can be more difficult for those who
are not demented.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago Ruth Skoog, a former freelance writer for The
Seattle Times, had an apartment of her own in the assisted-living
half of the Mount. She was a big wheel, serving on the
all-important food committee and the residents council and joining
all the organized outings. Then back-to-back strokes partly
paralyzed her and she crossed the hall into the nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   The other evening Mrs. Skoog was at dinner on the third floor.
``She's got all her marbles,'' she said, paying the ultimate
compliment to the woman in the wheelchair beside her, Ann
Hasslinger, a former marathon runner who, at a youthful 43, has
advanced multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   The same could not be said of many of the women, in their 80s
and 90s, around them. ``This is appalling,'' Mrs. Skoog said. ``If
my husband could see me now, he would die. He hated to visit his
own mother in the nursing home.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Skoog wishes there were more people she could talk to, and
yet she carries on. She questions aides closely about life outside
the Mount. Ms. Heath even says her complaining is a sign of health.
As the former Miss West Seattle went off in her wheelchair for her
weekly hair appointment, she said, ``One has to keep up one's
image.''
</P>
<P>
   Nursing homes look different to people depending on their age,
their health, their stage of life. In their 70s, Dick and Esther
Gorman made a pledge: No nursing homes. But when the couple turned
80 together, they began down a path that would lead them to an
assisted-living apartment at the Mount _ and the understanding that
someday they might move across the corridor, to the nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to all their friends, Gorman related why they
began searching for a final home and what they learned. Their
health, ``while very good was starting to show signs of changes
typical of 80-year olds,'' he wrote. ``Although we were quite sound
organically, it had become apparent we were experiencing some
memory loss, loss of energy, occasional confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Visiting retirement communities and assisted-living facilities,
including the Mount, ``we found each had its share of quite
disabled people and that frequently they would be sitting
(sometimes sprawled out and/or asleep) in the lobby. This was
culture shock for us, seeing all these old people.''
</P>
<P>
   They decided not to move until they absolutely had to _ but soon
they reconsidered. Looking at themselves more closely, he wrote,
``we began to see that we weren't that far away from being those
old people whose presence upset us.'' In June 1997 they moved to
the Mount.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, 18 residents the Gormans knew have died. ``There's a
sort of unspoken agreement among people who are here that mortality
is real, but nothing to worry about,'' said Gorman, who is
president of the assisted-living residents council. ``You have to
consider that a part of living is deteriorating.''
</P>
<P>
   And now that he makes regular visits to the nursing home to
visit friends, including Mrs. Skoog, he says it no longer holds the
horror that it once did. ``We're all heading in that direction,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The death notices go up in the corridors every few days, it
seems. In the first week of November, four residents died. The
last, 91-year-old Mildred Burke, was the day's featured obituary in
The Seattle Times. Ms. Burke had helped develop smaller hearing
aids and voice boxes, had been a crack swimmer, sailor and skier,
and had volunteered her time to visit hundreds of people in nursing
homes before entering one herself.
</P>
<P>
   But death is not what people at the Mount fear most. For all the
fears that Americans have of nursing homes, like soldiers in battle
the aged fear a crippling disability more than death. They are way
past American society's illusion that youth is eternal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I going to be bedridden?'' said Vivian Grenfell, who hopes
her weekly sessions in a pool will help ward off that day. ``Is
that the next step?''
</P>
<P>
   Soren Dahl, 85, says he considers himself lucky to have landed
the bed by the window in Room 563. He has a spectacular view of
Puget Sound, downtown Seattle and, beyond, the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Dahl spends hours at the window, tracking the planes, the
ferries, the lights at night. He invites visitors to sit and watch
the world with him.
</P>
<P>
   How did he get the room with the view? The previous occupant,
Dahl said matter-of-factly, died.

LAWYERS FOR TERRY NICHOLS REQUEST NEW TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo.)  (lb) 
 By JO THOMAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Terry Nichols has asked the federal appeals court in Denver for
a new trial in the Oklahoma City bombing, contending that the
federal judge who presided over his case erred at both his trial
and his sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, a federal court jury in Denver convicted Nichols,
43, a military-surplus dealer, of conspiring with his former Army
buddy, Timothy McVeigh, to bomb the Oklahoma City federal building,
where 168 people died on April 19, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols was also convicted on eight counts of involuntary
manslaughter in the deaths of the eight federal law-enforcement
agents killed in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Judge Richard Matsch of U.S. District Court in Denver
sentenced Nichols to life in prison and ordered him to pay the
General Services Administration, which manages federal properties,
$14.5 million in restitution for the destruction of the building.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols' lawyers, Michael Tigar, Susan Foreman and Adam
Thurschwell, filed their brief in the appeals court on Thursday.
They contended that Matsch erred in the instructions he gave the
jurors, in the testimony he permitted and in his interpretation of
federal sentencing guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The judge erred, they contended, when he told the jury that
Nichols' responsibility for the deaths of people killed as a result
of the bombing conspiracy did not depend on proof that he intended
to kill anyone. An intent to kill, Nichols' lawyers argued, is a
necessary element in the offense. The jurors who convicted Nichols
of conspiracy acquitted him of blowing up the building and of
first- or second-degree murder in the deaths of the officers.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols' lawyers also contended that Nichols should have been
sentenced under federal guidelines for arson and property damage,
not first-degree murder, and that the order for restitution was
punitive and ignored Nichols' inability to pay.

PINOCHET CASE SPURS DEBATE ON INTERNATIONAL LAWS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID _ As judges in Britain deliberate the fate of the
one-time Chilean dictator, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the rarefied
world of international law has been sent into a flurry of activity,
with lawyers issuing papers and opinions on what they see as a case
with enormous legal implications.
</P>
<P>
   Many scholars and jurists regard the general's unexpected arrest
in London on charges of genocide and murder, and a request for his
extradition by Spain, as an unusual chance to test high-minded
human rights conventions that oblige countries to prosecute great
atrocities but are invariably ignored. Even when Pol Pot of
Cambodia was detained before his death, some experts note, no
country was willing to seek his extradition and try him for his
role in the deaths of at least 1 million Cambodians.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, some experts say, the Pinochet case will test
whether Britain is willing to let its international human rights
commitments prevail over a domestic law giving immunity to heads of
state. Second, they say, it will test whether a former dictator
with a disastrous human rights record can be tried for crimes
against humanity by a national court in a country that is not his
own. A decision from the House of Lords in London is expected on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Such trials involving former top officials and foreign judges
have invariably been held in international tribunals _ Panama's
former leader, Manuel Noriega, was not tried in the United States
for crimes against humanity but for drug trafficking, racketeering
and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   So it was considered all the more quixotic when in 1996 Spain's
best-known investigating judge brought suits against the military
leaders of Argentina and Chile, where the governing right-wing
military mounted particularly cruel repressions of the left in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Baltasar Garzon, who is famous in Spain for taking on
high-profile cases, at first aimed his inquiry at the fate of
Spanish citizens. Several hundred Spaniards or their descendants
were tortured, killed or ``disappeared'' in the repression. Laws
dating back to Spain's colonial empire give Spanish courts the
right to investigate the plight of their citizens abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But Garzon reached further. He also invoked a Spanish law that
gives the courts jurisdiction over a series of crimes ``committed
by Spaniards or foreigners outside the national territory,''
including crimes of terrorism and genocide.
</P>
<P>
   The judge used this law _ adopted in 1985 but based on previous
statutes _ to charge Pinochet with torture, terrorism and genocide.
And it was this law and a series of international laws that Garzon
used to order the general's arrest and seek his extradition.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in Madrid say the Spanish law he invoked essentially
reflects the international conventions to which Spain is bound. As
nations sign and ratify conventions and treaties they must adapt
their domestic laws to their new commitments. And Spain has signed
most parts of the evolving body of international human rights law
that has come into being since 1945.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest warrant for Pinochet also cites nine international
conventions and resolutions dealing with human rights that the
Pinochet regime is said to have violated, including the
international convention against genocide of 1948 and the
convention against torture of 1984. The binding conventions
invariably stipulate that parties must punish people guilty of
violations, no matter what their rank or status or where the crimes
took place.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the covenants that Pinochet is accused of having
violated also deal with ``crimes against humanity,'' commonly
defined as grave human rights crimes that are ``systematic and
widespread.'' The Spanish judge holds that torture, killings and
the ``disappearing'' of people were indeed systematic and
widespread.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the judge charges the general with genocide because he
tried to destroy an entire group of people, namely his opponents.
The arrest warrant says that the so-called Operation Condor was one
instrument of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   According to a declassified State Department document of 1976,
Operation Condor is the code name for tracking down ``leftists,
Communists and Marxists'' in South America. It says that ``Chile is
the center for Operation Condor'' and that other countries,
including Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay, and perhaps
Brazil, are members. It adds that special Condor teams equipped
with ``false documents'' can travel anywhere ``to carry out
sanctions up to assassination.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish arrest warrant lists 97 victims of several
nationalities, but how many people died as a result of Operation
Condor is still being investigated by Garzon. Some experts in
international law believe that while Garzon has sufficient evidence
for his charges of torture and terrorism, his charge of genocide is
the weakest.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that events in Chile did not meet the genocide
definition under international law because people were killed for
belonging to a political group and not to ``a national, ethnic,
racial or religious group.'' Garzon has argued that the definition
of genocide has been evolving and has in several instances included
political persecution.
</P>
<P>
   If genocide does apply, Pinochet will be unable to claim
immunity, as he has, because the convention makes no exceptions for
anyone. It says that all parties must ``prevent and punish''
genocide. It adds that those accused of committing genocide ``shall
be punished, whether they are constitutionally responsible rulers,
public officials or private individuals.'' Britain, Spain and Chile
have signed the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Another United Nations declaration, signed in 1989 and dealing
with the investigation of extralegal, arbitrary and summary
executions, says that governments must try suspects or extradite
them to other countries wanting to try them. It says, ``This
principle shall apply irrespective of who and where the
perpetrators or the victims are, their nationalities of where the
offense was committed.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is the Convention Against Torture, also signed by Britain
and Spain, as well as Chile, that is seen as particularly relevant
in the Pinochet case. It says that any country that has signed it
must put ``the alleged offender'' on trial if he is present on its
territory, a clause that makes Pinochet vulnerable to British law.
The convention says that if the country does not try such an
offender, it must extradite him to a country that will. In this
case that would be Spain.
</P>
<P>
   International lawyers say it is surprising that cases of this
kind have not come to court before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now it seemed that if you killed one person, you went to
jail,'' said Reed Brody, a lawyer with Human Rights Watch in New
York. ``But if you had the power to murder a thousand people, you
would also have the power to grant yourself immunity or amnesty, as
General Pinochet did in Chile. The case of Pinochet is about
putting a stop to that.''

NEW LEAD IN ATTACK ON ARGENTINE JEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Israel, Brazil)  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ Four years after the car-bombing of a
Jewish community center here that left 86 dead, Argentine officials
say they are hopeful that the detention of a potentially crucial
witness in Brazil this week will finally lead to a breakthrough in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   The investigations into the bombing of the Israeli Embassy here
in 1992, which left 28 dead, and the bombing of the community
center, the Argentine Israeli Mutual Association, two years later
have sputtered for years despite many tantalizing leads.
</P>
<P>
   Two Argentine prosecutors flew to Brazil on Thursday to
interview Wilson Dos Santos, a 40-year-old resident of Sao Paulo,
who had walked into the Argentine, Israeli and Brazilian consulates
in Milan, Italy, two weeks before the bombing to warn officials of
an impending terrorist attack in Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   Officials paid no attention to the warning at the time. Dos
Santos added new details to his account in interviews with the
Argentine federal police four months after the attack, only to
recant everything before a federal judge the following week. Then
he disappeared, until the police in Sao Paulo detained him for
possible extradition to Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Argentine law-enforcement officials had requested
that Brazil help them locate Dos Santos. It is not yet clear
whether Dos Santos was in hiding or what he had been doing the last
few years. Brazilian and Argentine officials said he was not under
arrest.

   SANTIAGO, Chile _ Snapshots from Chile: Shortly after Gen.
Augusto Pinochet was arrested in London five weeks ago on a Spanish
warrant, neighborhood officials cut off garbage pickups at the
Spanish and British embassies here. But a couple of days later
cooler heads prevailed and garbage removal resumed.
</P>
<P>
   _ A portly right-wing senator, declaring his solidarity with
``the savior of our nation,'' announced that he was going on a
hunger strike until the general was released. But when legal
proceedings bogged down in London, he quietly succumbed to his
hunger pangs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Exactly one month after the general's arrest, Walter Riesco,
president of the Confederation of Production and Commerce, publicly
warned that if the former dictator is extradited to Spain, ``the
situation in Chile will once again become unsustainable.'' On the
same day, the Chilean stock market climbed, contributing to a
sustained rally that has lifted the market's index more than 20
percent since Pinochet was detained.
</P>
<P>
   Such touches of whimsy have offered more than welcome respites
from what may well be the most serious test of Chile's transition
to democracy since Pinochet left the presidential palace eight
years ago. They suggest how much Chile has calmed in recent years,
after decades of inflamed passions stirred first by the chaotic
lunge toward socialism by the government of President Salvador
Allende, followed by the deadly coup in 1973 that propelled
Pinochet to power and began 17 years of brutal repression.
</P>
<P>
   The general's arrest provoked demonstrations by rightist and
leftist activists in which eggs and rocks were thrown, but these
have lost steam with nobody having been killed or seriously
injured. Some politicians have received death threats. But the
police and armed forces have remained disciplined for the most
part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the country as very, very stable,'' said Ricardo Israel,
chairman of the political science department at the University of
Chile.
</P>
<P>
   The relative calm presents a contrast to the last few times
Chile went through crises over issues of the past. In 1991, after
the release of a government truth commission report documenting the
deaths and disappearances of more than 2,000 people during the
Pinochet years, assassins took the lives of three political
figures, including a right-wing senator. Three years later,
soldiers appeared in the streets in a partially effective effort to
block investigations of the military.
</P>
<P>
   Now, once again, Pinochet is dominating the news, and the
nightly broadcasts of emotional interviews with relatives of those
who disappeared have stirred memories that most Chileans would
prefer to forget. Nevertheless, commentators have pointed out that
such frequent broadcasts of interviews highly critical of Pinochet
and the army would have been unthinkable only a few years ago.
Particularly penetrating have been reports about Operation Condor,
the effort to seize and murder dozens of exiles living in Argentina
and other countries, for which Pinochet is being investigated by a
Spanish judge.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most striking image to emerge from the crisis
has been that of Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza, a leader of
the Socialist Party that was once led by Allende and that now
governs with the centrist Christian Democrats, calling on the
British to free the man who once forced him into exile.

   ``The last thing Chile needs is Pinochet as a martyr,'' Insulza
said, expressing a commonly held notion that if Pinochet were
somehow hounded to death by his legal problems, the country could
still explode. It is a practical, political argument that suggests
no newfound respect for the general. Rather, when Insulza repeats
it almost daily, it is a reminder that the governing elite now
bridge a political divide that was as wide as any in Latin America
a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our own Cold War but now there is a consensus in favor
of private enterprise and democracy,'' said Jorge Schaulsohn
Brodsky, a former speaker of the Chamber of Deputies and a member
of the social democratic Party for Democracy. ``While we still have
a shopping list of issues, out of that shopping list we now only
disagree on one and we agree on all the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue on which Chileans disagree, of course, is still
Pinochet, who turns 83 on Wednesday and is in poor health. He
stepped down as armed forces commander eight months ago, but
remains a senator for life, a position that conveys legal immunity
under a constitution he conceived as dictator. So he was weighing
in on political issues until he was arrested. And his constitution
will probably continue to grant disproportionate influence to two
rightist parties and the military for at least several more years,
even if the constitution is overhauled eventually..
</P>
<P>
   But even if the panel of Britain's House of Lords that is
considering his case allows Pinochet to return to Chile soon, there
are already signs that he has become a much diminished figure.
Several influential conservatives have even suggested that the
general should make some grand gesture upon his return, like an
apology for excesses during his regime. A few have even endorsed a
proposal by the Chilean Catholic Church hierarchy to reassemble the
government truth commission to gather more information on those who
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the general comes back, that will be the end of it and he
will no longer play a political role,'' said Sebastian Pinera,
presidential candidate of the conservative National Renewal Party.
``But if he doesn't come back, he will be a player forever,
especially if he dies abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   So the crisis is not over. The other day, President Eduardo Frei
told a business group that the discord since Pinochet's arrest
``shows that our reconciliation is incomplete and we must work hard
to strengthen that process in the future.'' Then he flew off to
South Africa to start a nine-day global trade mission.

   SANTIAGO, Chile _ Snapshots from Chile: Shortly after Gen.
Augusto Pinochet was arrested in London five weeks ago on a Spanish
warrant, neighborhood officials cut off garbage pickups at the
Spanish and British embassies here. But a couple of days later
cooler heads prevailed and garbage removal resumed.
</P>
<P>
   _ A portly right-wing senator, declaring his solidarity with
``the savior of our nation,'' announced that he was going on a
hunger strike until the general was released. But when legal
proceedings bogged down in London, he quietly succumbed to his
hunger pangs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Exactly one month after the general's arrest, Walter Riesco,
president of the Confederation of Production and Commerce, publicly
warned that if the former dictator is extradited to Spain, ``the
situation in Chile will once again become unsustainable.'' On the
same day, the Chilean stock market climbed, contributing to a
sustained rally that has lifted the market's index more than 20
percent since Pinochet was detained.
</P>
<P>
   Such touches of whimsy have offered more than welcome respites
from what may well be the most serious test of Chile's transition
to democracy since Pinochet left the presidential palace eight
years ago. They suggest how much Chile has calmed in recent years,
after decades of inflamed passions stirred first by the chaotic
lunge toward socialism by the government of President Salvador
Allende, followed by the deadly coup in 1973 that propelled
Pinochet to power and began 17 years of brutal repression.
</P>
<P>
   The general's arrest provoked demonstrations by rightist and
leftist activists in which eggs and rocks were thrown, but these
have lost steam with nobody having been killed or seriously
injured. Some politicians have received death threats. But the
police and armed forces have remained disciplined for the most
part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the country as very, very stable,'' said Ricardo Israel,
chairman of the political science department at the University of
Chile.
</P>
<P>
   The relative calm presents a contrast to the last few times
Chile went through crises over issues of the past. In 1991, after
the release of a government truth commission report documenting the
deaths and disappearances of more than 2,000 people during the
Pinochet years, assassins took the lives of three political
figures, including a right-wing senator. Three years later,
soldiers appeared in the streets in a partially effective effort to
block investigations of the military.
</P>
<P>
   Now, once again, Pinochet is dominating the news, and the
nightly broadcasts of emotional interviews with relatives of those
who disappeared have stirred memories that most Chileans would
prefer to forget. Nevertheless, commentators have pointed out that
such frequent broadcasts of interviews highly critical of Pinochet
and the army would have been unthinkable only a few years ago.
Particularly penetrating have been reports about Operation Condor,
the effort to seize and murder dozens of exiles living in Argentina
and other countries, for which Pinochet is being investigated by a
Spanish judge.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most striking image to emerge from the crisis
has been that of Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza, a leader of
the Socialist Party that was once led by Allende and that now
governs with the centrist Christian Democrats, calling on the
British to free the man who once forced him into exile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing Chile needs is Pinochet as a martyr,'' Insulza
said, expressing a commonly held notion that if Pinochet were
somehow hounded to death by his legal problems, the country could
still explode. It is a practical, political argument that suggests
no newfound respect for the general. Rather, when Insulza repeats
it almost daily, it is a reminder that the governing elite now

   DETROIT _ As sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks become
bigger and more common, their height and high-mounted headlights
are making visibility on the road more difficult for other drivers,
particularly at night. Federal regulators are growing concerned.
</P>
<P>
   The normal headlights of an oncoming full-size sport utility
vehicle or pickup truck can create so much glare that they appear
to car drivers as bright as high beams. When such a big vehicle
follows a car at night, the car's rear-view mirror and side mirrors
reflect very bright glare.
</P>
<P>
   The high rear windows on sport utility vehicles and pickup
trucks, as well as minivans, can create another visibility problem.
The bottom of the rear windows is typically 4 feet high, about the
same height as the top of car windshields, preventing many car
drivers from seeing traffic ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Headlight glare appears to be the bigger problem. ``It is
incredibly distracting when you're on the road,'' said David
Lichtenthal, an accountant in Marlboro, N.J., who drives a Mercury
Mystique sedan. ``Sometimes I wind up pulling over to the right to
let the sport ute pass me.''
</P>
<P>
   Full-size sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks tend to have
headlights 36 to 39 inches high _ the same height as the side
mirror on a small car like a Dodge Neon. Glare is 10 to 20 times
worse than recommended levels when headlights are at the height of
a driver's eyes or side mirror, according to a study by the Society
of Automotive Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Glare and visibility problems are likely to increase as pickup
trucks, minivans and sport utility vehicles become much more
common. Such vehicles now account for half of all new family
vehicle sales, up from 16 percent in 1971. And sport utility
vehicles and pickups are growing bigger, with higher headlights and
rear windows.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators are ``fairly likely'' to take action on
light-truck headlight glare in the next two years, said Stephen
Kratzke, director of crash avoidance standards at the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The agency may require that
light-truck headlights be mounted lower or aimed downward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real issue; it's something we're aware of,'' Kratzke
said. ``We'd like to do something to address that glare; we've seen
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators also say that they have some concerns about
the greater variation in vehicle heights. But they are unlikely to
set any new rules because they have received few written complaints
from drivers and because they cannot calculate the precise effect
on safety.
</P>
<P>
   Using state and local data, the federal government keeps track
of dozens of variables on virtually every fatal crash across the
country. But these variables do not include glare or the effects of
nearby vehicles' high windows because these are hard for police
officers to assess when they arrive after an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers say that neither problem can be too serious because
the overall death rate edged down last year. But regulators
attribute the decrease to less drunken driving.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Headlight engineers at auto parts companies are worried that
increased glare hurts safety by tiring car drivers' eyes. ``My
feeling is it's debilitating; it wears you down,'' said Walter
Kosmatka, chairman of a headlight height task force of the Society
of Automotive Engineers, which sets technical standards.
</P>
<P>
   But automakers' safety experts are less worried. ``I suspect
there are very few if any collision events associated with glare,''
said Robert Lange, the vehicle safety director for General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   While its impact on safety effects is debated, the growing gap
in headlight heights is undisputed. A University of Michigan study
of 1995-model-year vehicles found that the average car had
headlights mounted 24 inches off the pavement, while the average
light truck's headlights were 32 inches high. And the difference in
heights appears to have increased since the study, said a
university researcher, Michael Flanagan.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, sales of full-size sport utility vehicles have nearly
tripled since the 1995 model year, as automakers have introduced
many new models while gasoline prices have fallen. More light
trucks now have four-wheel drive, which raises a vehicle's body by
an extra two or three inches. At the same time, new technology
makes headlights up to 30 percent brighter than in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers contend that the headlights of sport utility vehicles
and pickups need to be mounted higher than car headlights.
Light-truck drivers sit higher than car drivers, and headlights
provide more effective illumination when mounted as close as
possible to the height of a driver's eyes. Road signs are designed
to reflect light directly back, and seem less bright for motorists
who sit in tall vehicles with low-mounted headlights. (But most
minivans, whose drivers sit fairly high, are based on car designs,
and their headlights are mounted almost as low as car headlights.)
</P>
<P>
   But the task force of auto industry engineers concluded in 1996
that current light- and heavy-truck headlights should probably be
lower.
</P>
<P>
   The task force recommended that the maximum allowable height for
all vehicle headlights be lowered to either 36 inches or 40 inches
from 54.
</P>
<P>
   Kosmatka of the task force said it was unnecessary for any but
the largest freight trucks to be at even the new recommended limit.
A separate Society of Automotive Engineers task force has just
drafted a recommendation that all headlights mounted at 36 inches
or higher be tilted downward to reduce glare.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial fleet operators commonly aim their trucks' headlights
slightly downward, although that is not required by regulations.
But light-truck headlights shine straight ahead, the highest
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The high windows of light trucks present a separate but related
visibility problem. Paul Mercer, the owner of a computer software
company in Cupertino, Calif., still drives sports cars, even though
he must hug the left side of the lane when trailing a bigger
vehicle, in the hope of seeing around it. But Mercer's luck almost
ran out on Oct. 17, when he was driving a Mazda Miata in dense
traffic on Interstate 880.
</P>
<P>
   The traffic slowed suddenly, but Mercer was behind a large sport
utility and unable to see the high-mounted brake lights come on in
the rear windows of vehicles ahead. The sport utility braked and
swerved at the last minute to avoid a wheel in the road. Mercer did
not have enough time to react. ``I ran over the wheel and blew out
my tire and had to limp off at the next exit,'' he said. ``I was
happy to be alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercer's accident could have been worse. High-mounted center
brake lights, typically placed in rear windows, are becoming less
effective in preventing multivehicle pileups. The height of light
trucks may be one reason, according to a recent, little-noticed
agency safety report.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, vehicles with the lights were 14.6 percent less likely
than vehicles without them to be hit from behind in pileups
involving three or more vehicles. But in the early 1990s, vehicles
with the high-mounted lights were only 2.45 percent less likely to
be hit in such crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Sonja Bultnyck, a Chrysler spokeswoman, said that on highways,
car drivers should allow space in front of them equal to at least
one car length for every 10 miles an hour that they are traveling.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer said he was only two car lengths behind the sport utility
vehicle in heavy traffic going 50 mph. But Chrysler's advice does
not satisfy him. Whenever he tries to leave a wider space on San
Francisco's crowded highways, someone cuts in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers say this shows that bad drivers, not vehicle design,
cause crashes. ``It's not the vehicle we can point at, then,'' Mrs.
Bultnyck said. ``It's the inconsiderate drivers.''

U.S. AND IRAQ AGREE ON ONE POINT: SANCTIONS HURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even as they swap charges of duplicity and, yet
again, brace for a possible military showdown, Bill Clinton and
Saddam Hussein can agree on this much: The economic sanctions
imposed on Iraq more than eight years ago, which Iraq has cited as
the cause of the latest crisis, have devastated its economy and its
people.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis contend that their frustration over the crippling
sanctions led them last month to announce an end to all cooperation
with U.N. weapons inspectors until the blockade was lifted. The
sanctions make exceptions only for medicine, medical supplies and
food.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq backed down last weekend and allowed the inspectors to
return to work only when confronted with the threat of a major U.S.
military strike.
</P>
<P>
   Imposed on Iraq by the U.N. Security Council in August 1990,
days after Kuwait was invaded, the sanctions were almost certainly
not the sole reason for the Iraqis' most recent intransigence with
the weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials believe that the Iraqis were just as interested
in halting the work of the U.N. inspectors for fear that they were
closing in on new evidence of stockpiles of chemical and biological
weapons and the ability to make more.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.N. sanctions were just as certainly a factor in the
Iraqi ultimatum. They are among the toughest imposed on a nation in
the modern age and are estimated to have cost Iraq more than $120
billion in oil revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The human cost has been staggering, too. Millions of Iraqis have
been left without adequate food, clean water and medicine. The
United Nations has estimated, based on Iraqi government figures,
that 1 million Iraqi children are malnourished and that 700,000
children have died from malnutrition or disease since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and others who have studied Iraq say that Saddam is
far less concerned with the suffering of the people than he is with
the arms-import ban placed on Iraq as part of the economic
blockade. Despite the rampant malnutrition, he has spent hundreds
of millions of dollars since the war on new marble-draped palaces.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions have deprived the Iraqi leader of the ability to
buy the advanced weapons that he has always coveted and the
so-called dual-use technology that would allow the Iraqis to make
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, France and other nations have called on the United
Nations to ease the sanctions in recent years, but the United
States has stood firm on the issue and largely prevailed. The
deputy prime minister of Iraq, Tariq Aziz, said last week that the
sanctions were still in place only because of ``American pressure
and American blackmail.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's only significant relief came in 1995, when the United
Nations agreed to allow it to sell oil to obtain necessities like
food or medicine, which are exempted from the sanctions. Such an
arrangement had been offered since 1991, but the Iraqis refused.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions will remain in place, the administration has said,
until Iraq meets the requirements of a series of Security Council
resolutions, which include a demand that Iraq comply fully with the
weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they really want is to be able to have it both ways,''
said James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, ``to be able to
keep their weapons of mass destruction and have the sanctions
lifted. That is simply not going to happen.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sanctions were imposed on Iraq on Aug. 6, 1990, four days after
Iraqi troops stormed into neighboring Kuwait and annexed it. The
sanctions were contained in Resolution 661, which placed a sweeping
economic blockade on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   After Iraq's rout in the Persian Gulf war the following year,
the Security Council passed a key resolution, No. 687, which
outlined the terms of the cease-fire and kept most of the economic
sanctions in place. The resolution, adopted on April 3, 1991,
prohibited all trade to Iraq except that involving ``essential
human needs,'' like food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions could only be lifted, according to the resolution,
when Iraq revealed and destroyed its ballistic missiles and its
ability to make weapons of mass destruction _ chemical, biological
or nuclear. The council agreed to review Iraq's compliance with the
resolution every 60 days to determine whether the sanctions could
be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   The United States suggested that it would have preferred an even
tougher resolution, with the lifting of sanctions tied to the
ouster of Saddam. ``We are not interested in seeking a relaxation
of sanctions as long as Saddam Hussein is in power,'' Secretary of
State James Baker said in May 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Shattered by its defeat in the Gulf war, Iraq had little choice
but to begin to cooperate with the United Nations. It grudgingly
allowed teams of weapons inspectors to roam the country in search
of weapons of mass destruction and the equipment to make them.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually from the beginning, the U.N. Special Commission, which
was charged with the disarming, complained that the Iraqis were
lying and hiding evidence of their chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1991, the Security Council, seeing evidence of a
humanitarian disaster, offered Iraq a plan that would have allowed
it to sell up to $1.6 billion worth of oil, with most of the
proceeds placed in an escrow account to buy food and medicine under
strict U.N. supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq refused, describing the plan as an infringement of its
sovereignty. It was only in 1996, after reports of widespread
malnutrition and a sharp increase in childhood mortality rates,
that Iraq agreed to the oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
   The plan let Iraq sell $2 billion in oil every six months for
food and medicine, with the proceeds spent at the direction of U.N.
officials. The figure was raised last February to $5.2 billion
every six months. The United Nations began the distribution of food
and medicine last year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the debate has been muted by the latest crisis, members
of the Security Council have disagreed in the past over the
conditions that Iraq must meet to avoid sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Several countries say the language of the U.N. resolutions that
ended the Gulf war allow the sanctions to be lifted as soon as the
Security Council determines that Iraq has shut down its programs
for the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States says its reading of the resolutions
suggests that the sanctions cannot be lifted until Iraq meets other
terms of the 1991 cease-fire, including full restitution for
property destroyed or stolen by the Iraqis after the Kuwait
invasion in 1990 and an accounting for hundreds of Kuwaiti
prisoners missing since the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sanctions may stay on in perpetuity,'' Bill Richardson, the
former U.S. delegate to the United Nations, said earlier this year.
``Sanctions are going to stay forever _ or until Iraq complies
fully.''

YELTSIN EXPRESSES OUTRAGE AT LAWMAKER'S KILLING 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MOSCOW _ The killing Friday night in St. Petersburg of Galina
Starovoitova, a leading liberal politician and tireless defender of
Russia's democratic reforms, shocked her old allies who claimed her
as the latest victim of the country's lethally corrupt political
climate.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, President Boris Yeltsin dispatched his top
law-enforcement officials to investigate the shooting death of the
52-year-old parliamentary deputy, who had been his close associate
during the early years of Russia's transition from communism to
democracy, and served as his adviser on inter-ethnic affairs.
</P>
<P>
   According to local police, Ms. Starovoitova was struck and
killed Friday night by three bullets to the head in the entranceway
of her apartment building off one of St. Petersburg's historic
canals. Her press aide, Ruslan Linkov, was seriously wounded. The
two guns used in the attack, a submachine gun and a pistol with a
silencer, were found at the scene, in the style of Russian contract
killings.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Yeltsin expressed his ``profound anger'' and
said he had taken personal control of the investigation. ``The
shots which cut short the life of Galina Vasileyna wounded every
Russian who cherishes democratic values,'' Yeltsin said. ``A
peremptory challenge was thrown at our entire society.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, interviewed on television, was
visibly shaken as he expressed his outrage at the killing. ``This
banditry must be brought to an immediate end,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Starovoitova, a psychologist and ethnographer, was a
spirited and visible leader of Russia's young democratic movement,
who shared many a platform with Yeltsin and the late human-rights
campaigner Andrei Sakharov in the late 1980s and early 1990s. She
was a cofounder of Democratic Russia, and kept a high profile as a
leading if increasingly lonely ``democrat'' long after the movement
fell into disfavor with a disgruntled electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, she had declared herself a candidate for governor
of the region outside St. Petersburg, in elections scheduled
sometime next year. She had also recently remarried, prompting a
string of articles about the personal life of one of Russia's few
prominent women politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians of all stripes _ including the leader of the Russian
Communist Party _ Saturday criticized the killing as a criminal act
that was only the latest example of the lawlessness that has
pervaded public life in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   St. Petersburg, Russia's former imperial capital, has been the
scene of a number of political contract killings in recent years.
The city is also in the midst of a particularly nasty election
campaign for the local municipal council, which has brought forth a
slew of accusations of dirty tricks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question to be answered is whether this was a case of a
political group getting even with a politician over a particular
fact, or a contract killing on a wider level, aimed at provoking
political consequences,'' said former Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev, in an interview with a Russian news agency. He praised
Ms. Starovoitova as ``learned, courageous and active, a born
politician.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Echo Moskvy, a Moscow radio station, former
Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar, the first architect of Russian
economic reform and a close political ally of Ms. Starovoitova,
said she had received many threats. Reportedly, she never traveled
with a bodyguard.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was extremely tough in opposing radical nationalists and
Communists in the Parliament,'' Gaidar said. ``She was like a bone
in the throat for them.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the St. Petersburg police report, Ms. Starovoitova
and her press aide were shot as they returned late Friday night to
her apartment in St. Petersburg's historic downtown district. Ms.
Starovoitova was already dead when their bodies were found by a
neighbor at 10:45 p.m. In their report, police said they found
$1,700 and 1,000 Bulgarian levs in cash and several credit cards at
the scene, apparently ruling out robbery as a motive.
</P>
<P>
   The killing will be prosecuted under Russia's laws against
terrorism, and the investigation will be carried out by Interior
Minister Sergei Stepashin and Vladimir Putin, director of the
Federal Security Service, who arrived Saturday in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, himself from St. Petersburg, called the killing a
``loathsome'' event. ``It is one of the black pages in our modern
history,'' he said. ``It doesn't do much to improve our reputation,
the reputation of the country as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   At a hastily called meeting Saturday by members of Northern
Capital, a local political movement closely associated with Ms.
Starovoitova, colleagues openly blamed corrupt political forces in
the city for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't doubt that the murder was politically motivated,''
said Viktor Krivulin, a member of Northern Capital. ``She was an
exception among politicians. In the past 10 years, they tried to
find compromising material against her, but she was blameless so
they hated her even more, and they were afraid of her.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   For many who work at the broadcast television networks, the new
season of prime-time programming that began in September with the
usual high hopes for a batch of 37 new weekly series has already
degenerated into a disheartening and increasingly panic-stricken
game of ``what's wrong with this picture.''
</P>
<P>
   With more on the line than ever before, as costs of programming
mount and advertisers are increasingly courted by the expanding
number of cable stations, the networks, by their own reckoning,
have failed to add even a single new show this season that falls
indisputably into a category known as ``appointment viewing'' _ a
show that viewers make a point of watching every week.
</P>
<P>
   The networks' share of the television audience has fallen
steadily for years, but this year's performance is particularly
stark: Through the middle of November, network viewer totals were
down by about 5.75 million viewers, or about 9 percent from last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, the ratings for cable channels were up about
10 percent, thus proving the conclusion of many network executives
that cable channels, and not other broadcast channels, are now the
default channels for viewers when they decide they are uninterested
in a network's offerings.
</P>
<P>
   More tellingly, a disproportionate amount of the network falloff
is taking place at NBC, the network that had provided most of the
big hits of recent vintage. NBC has seen its audience levels fall
by about 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant change for NBC has been the departure of
``Seinfeld,'' its top comedy for five years.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Seinfeld' is so much more important than anybody
understood,'' said Peter Tortorici, a former head programmer at
CBS, who is now president of the Spanish language network
Telemundo. ``How do you replace a show that's popular in Alabama
and Boston, even though it was about Jewish characters from New
York? That just doesn't come along every day.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of reasons being cited for what one
television studio head called ``this sorry state of affairs'' _
from the thinning of the talent pool of writers to the reliance on
the timeworn formats of situation comedies and dramas.
</P>
<P>
   But numerous executives point to an overall lack of
distinctiveness in many of the series. These executives attribute
the sameness of much of the programming to the often slavish
devotion of most networks to grabbing an audience of younger adults
between the ages of 18 and 34 or 18 and 49, especially viewers from
urban areas with substantial incomes, because of advertisers prefer
to reach those specific viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young, upscale viewer doesn't watch enough television to
build a seven-night-a-week schedule around them,'' said Steve
Sternberg, a senior partner with TN Media, a company that advises
advertisers on buying time on television.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the six commercial networks _ NBC, ABC, Fox and the WB _
consciously aim almost their entire entertainment output at viewers
in these younger audience groups. And many believe that given the
difficulties of reaching a mass audience in the factionalized
modern entertainment universe, this is the only way to go,
particularly because advertising is the main source of income for
the networks.
</P>
<P>
   But the result, many executives and television producers said,
is a lack of originality in concept, casting and writing, ending up
in a raft of programs that look and feel so much the same that
viewers are apparently being left cold.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, despite ample evidence that the shows that have
broken through as hits in recent years have been totally fresh
ideas, delivered in a distinctive voice, network executives
continue to be wary of taking risks, several producers and studio
executives said.
</P>
<P>
   The results from this fall have been sufficiently dire that
executives in charge of programming have already been replaced at
two networks, NBC and Fox.
</P>
<P>
   But the falling ax this time had special meaning for network
watchers. In this case, longtime broadcast veterans, Warren
Littlefield at NBC and Peter Roth at Fox, were replaced by
executives who built their careers at cable channels: Scott Sassa
from the Turner channels and Doug Herzog from MTV and Comedy
Central.
</P>
<P>
   Herzog, the executive who brought the outrageous cartoon ``South
Park'' to Comedy Central, said his and Sassa's arrivals at
broadcast networks signaled a ``sea change'' in the business.
</P>
<P>
   Even one holdover top network programmer, Leslie Moonves at CBS,
while disputing the notion that the traditional network hit program
is threatened with extinction, said, ``It's time for re-invention''
in the program selection process.
</P>
<P>
   Executives, producers and agents shared broad agreement that the
system that creates hits, the lifeblood of television for half a
century, has begun to sputter and cough, to a point where at least
some predict that no program will ever come near to the ratings
enjoyed just last year by ``Seinfeld'' and ``ER'' on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think even a 30 share is possible for any show
again,'' said one senior network entertainment executive. The share
is the percentage of viewers a show attracts at a given hour. Both
``Seinfeld'' and ``ER'' routinely surpassed that figure for years;
only ``ER'' eclipses it now. A show can now be considered a hit
with just a 15 share, especially if its audience is mainly young
adults.
</P>
<P>
   Even NBC's own executives concede that their greatest failure
was in not being able to find a show remotely close to ``Seinfeld''
in appeal, despite four years of golden chances on Thursday nights
to launch series in the spots adjacent to ``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   But NBC's critics say the network failed because of a strategy
that insisted on appealing to the same audience with every show. A
string of shows about young, single New Yorkers in the advertising,
magazine or some other media industry has produced no discernible
hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``On close analysis, one could question NBC's broadcast plan
over the last three years,'' said one longtime packager of
television programs.
</P>
<P>
   This plan called for establishing NBC, in the words of one NBC
executive, as a ``premium brand'' _ one with an audience of young,
wealthy city dwellers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Because NBC was also the only network making real profits _ up
to $500 million a year _ its strategy was widely imitated. ``At one
point, every network was trying to be NBC,'' Tortorici said.
</P>
<P>
   There is another issue, illustrated by the popularity of
wrestling shows, now the biggest audience draw on cable: the
alienation of blue-collar viewers. ``Look at what's popular on
cable,'' said David Poltrack, the executive vice president of
research for CBS. ``Wrestling, football and `Walker Texas Ranger.'
That programming appeals to male, blue-collar viewers. They're not
getting anything to watch on the networks, most of which now only
want to reach yuppies.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Fox, after seeing a batch of sitcoms wiped out early
this season, has begun to score _ and to damage NBC's mighty
Thursday night lineup in recent weeks _ by using down-and-dirty
video specials geared to young, decidedly un-yuppie men, shows like
``When Good Pets Go Bad'' and ``Busted on the Job.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to tailor shows for the specific target group of
affluent young adults inevitably affects the process of program
creation, as network executives try to force shows to conform to
what they expect will appeal to that group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many times a writer is asked to add or change an element
or character of a show, even if it makes no creative sense, merely
in an attempt to reach a specific demographic,'' said Bob Broder,
one of the most prominent agents in the television business as head
of the agency Broder, Kurland, Webb, Uffner.
</P>
<P>
   And though there is near uniform agreement that only shows with
truly original concepts seem to be connecting with viewers, an
unwillingness to take risks often derails ideas before they are
even tried, several executives said.
</P>
<P>
   One head of a television production studio, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, outlined how the fear of risk undermined
the networks' acknowledged need for truly new ideas. ``We go into
development meetings after they see how all their shows are
failing, and they tell us we have to give them our wildest, most
creative ideas,'' the executive said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we tell our writers to come up with most original ideas
they can. Then we come back, and we've got about eight ideas to
pitch, four that are truly out there and four that are more like
original spins on familiar formats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that happens is they throw out the four wilder
ideas because they're just too risky. Then they start to tinker
with the others. And every change they suggest makes the show more
conventional. Then they give you a list for actors and say don't
cast anyone not on this list. Then there's a list for directors.
And by the time they get the shows, they wonder why they have no
original ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to get a truly distinctive show through is to be a
producer with a track record. Many of the biggest hits on the air
now are the result of the influence of one strong creative voice,
shows like Steven Bochco's ``NYPD Blue,'' David Kelley's ``Ally
McBeal'' and ``The Practice,'' Chris Carter's ``The X-Files'' and
Dick Wolf's ``Law and Order.''
</P>
<P>
   The one new show this season that many in the business see as
the best bet for developing into a hit is ``Sports Night'' on ABC,
precisely because of its distinctive style (somewhere between
comedy and drama) and the voice of its creator, Aaron Sorkin.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating everything else is the increasing pressure from
network executives to own part of every show they put on, as a way
to find profits. Shows get on the air because they are network
investments, not because they are good ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, several executives said the notion that hits can no
longer be found is greatly overstated. ``You can still make hits,''
Moonves of CBS said. ``But more and more you have to show
patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many shows in recent years have broken through after
some careful nurturing. These include NBC's ``Law and Order,''
Fox's ``Party of Five'' and ABC's ``Drew Carey.'' Two that seem
poised to break through this year are ``Everybody Loves Raymond''
and ``JAG,'' both on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   But calling a show a hit on CBS, which has the oldest audience
in television by far, is still near anathema to many television
executives, who count only young viewers. Compared with a show like
``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' on the WB, which has been on numerous
magazine covers and has the buzz that usually accompanies a hit,
``JAG,'' never on a magazine cover, is widely dismissed. But last
week ``JAG'' had 10 million more viewers than ``Buffy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry, that's a hit,'' Sternberg said. He noted that the
networks that seemed to be making headway this season, CBS and the
WB, ``are the ones that are on the opposite ends of the spectrum,
with the WB attracting teens and CBS attracting older adults _ they
are not going after that same 18- to 49-year-old audience.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this concern about overemphasizing young viewers had an
influence on Fox's decision to bring in Herzog, whose resume at MTV
and Comedy Central is a blueprint of how to succeed by targeting
narrow, advertiser-friendly audiences. Fox liked the edgy image
Herzog carved out for Comedy Central, and is looking for him to
bring the same to Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Herzog has already put the sitcom genre on notice, saying it is
badly ``in need of updating.'' Overall, his promised approach
sounds a lot like what those worried about the current television
season think has to be done: ``More risk-taking and a willingness
to look at things differently.''

RENO MOVES CLOSER TO FIRST DECISION ON FUND RAISING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno must decide by Tuesday
whether to seek an independent counsel to investigate Vice
President Al Gore, in the first of three decisions likely to
determine whether there will ever be an outside investigation of
Democratic fund raising in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's deliberations, which in the next two weeks will also turn
to the former White House deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes and
then to President Clinton, will sweep across a panorama of
political fund-raising practices.
</P>
<P>
   She has reviewed some of the same underlying facts for nearly
two years, each time refusing to refer the case to an outside
counsel. But Reno has yet to reach a conclusion on the actions of
Gore or the other officials, law-enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, however, the political stakes have unexpectedly
risen as the House impeachment and the Justice Department's
campaign-finance investigation show signs of overlapping.
</P>
<P>
   Republican investigators for the House Judiciary Committee
decided this week to move beyond the Monica Lewinsky matter and
include campaign finance among the issues they are tentatively
exploring as they look for a wider pattern of perjury, obstruction
of justice and abuse of power by the president.
</P>
<P>
   But the panel's interest might be short-lived. Lawmakers have
said they would vote on articles of impeachment early in December,
and Democrats are opposed to any expansion of the inquiry.
Nevertheless, the committee's inquiry has focused attention on
Reno's independent-counsel decisions.
</P>
<P>
   If she refuses to seek an independent counsel in each of the
three cases, as some law-enforcement officials believe to be
likely, it would almost certainly provoke a bitter outcry among
Republicans in Congress. One House committee investigating fund
raising has already voted to hold Reno in contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Even the possibility that the Judiciary Committee could advance
further onto Reno's campaign-finance turf could complicate the
attorney general's decision-making. Among other things, if the
scope of the impeachment inquiry widens far enough, it could
theoretically encompass an examination of Reno's own resistance to
appointing an independent prosecutor, although there is no evidence
that the White House played any role in Reno's past decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and the Judiciary panel are approaching
the issue with standards of evidence and goals that are very
different.
</P>
<P>
   The committee must decide whether Clinton committed impeachable
offenses. By comparison, Reno must decide, by a prosecutor's
standard, whether there are reasonable grounds to conclude that a
crime may have been committed in any of three discrete areas, each
focused on a different official.
</P>
<P>
   The deadlines, officials under scrutiny and issues being
examined by Reno are as follows:
</P>
<P>
   _ Nov. 24: Did Vice President Gore answer truthfully when he
told Justice Department investigators that he did not know that
contributions he solicited would be split between hard- and
soft-money accounts? A White House memorandum was unearthed several
months ago that indicated Gore attended a meeting on Nov. 21, 1995,
in which the splitting of contributions was discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said he did not realize that some of the large
contributions he solicited would be used not as soft money _
unregulated donations meant to finance general party activities
like voter-registration drives _ but as hard money. Hard money is
subject to regulation but could be spent on specific Clinton-Gore
re-election activities, like television advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nov. 30: Did Ickes answer truthfully in a deposition to Senate
investigators in 1997, when he said he did not recall taking any
action to intervene in a Teamsters strike at a Diamond Walnut
processing plant in Stockton, Calif.? Memorandums and testimony
showed that Ickes asked Mickey Kantor, then U.S. trade
representative, to telephone the company.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dec. 7: Did Clinton knowingly violate election laws when he
directed a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign by the
Democratic National Committee that might have improperly benefited
the Clinton-Gore campaign? Reno opened the inquiry after Federal
Election Commission field auditors questioned the legality of the
ad campaign, saying the commercials contained an electioneering
message, but should have stuck to generic party themes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials said that Reno's aides had engaged in
a spirited debate in the case of Gore after FBI interviews with
other officials in the November 1995 meeting produced contradictory
recollections. Some recalled a discussion of how contributions
would be split. Others did not.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee's interest in possible campaign-finance
abuses had been rumored for weeks. But on Thursday, David
Schippers, chief Republican counsel for the House committee's
impeachment inquiry, asked the Justice Department to turn over
copies of a confidential report written in July by Charles La Bella
as he was leaving as Reno's top campaign-finance prosecutor, along
with a report written last year by Director Louis Freeh of the FBI.
The reports had been prepared for Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Both reports directly challenged the conventional thinking at
the Justice Department, which held that Reno had no legal basis
under the independent-counsel statute to refer the political
fund-raising case to an outside prosecutor, because federal
election laws were too porous to hold top officials criminally
liable.
</P>
<P>
   The reports have been previously sought by Republicans in
Congress. Only a few lawmakers have seen them, and they saw only
the heavily edited versions. Reno's refusal to release the reports
to the House government Reform and Oversight Committee, which has
been looking into 1996 campaign fund-raising practices, resulted in
a contempt citation. The full texts of the Freeh and La Bella
reports, which are based on grand jury material, remain secret.
</P>
<P>
   Still, their main conclusions are known, including the overall
findings that the Democrats engaged in questionable activities in
many areas, that there was sufficient evidence for an independent
counsel and that only an outside prosecutor could credibly sort
through the complex body of accumulated evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the Judiciary panel may have difficulty digesting
the reports, because they were written to persuade Reno to seek an
independent prosecutor. Although La Bella and Freeh suggested that
Clinton operated at the center of a swirl of possible illegality,
neither directly addressed whether Clinton committed a potentially
impeachable offense.

 By SARA RIMER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It was Saturday night at the Providence-Mount St.
Vincent nursing home. Marie Swegle, 96, and her friends on the
fifth floor were lingering at the dinner table in their
wheelchairs, watching the news. John Glenn had safely returned to
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Swegle, who a year before had learned to walk again after
falling and breaking her neck, was not overly impressed by the
77-year-old astronaut. Neither was Effie Constantine, at 67 a good
15 years younger than anyone else at the table but crippled by
hydrocephalus. ``It's a waste of money, sending him up in space,''
she said. ``Why don't they spend the money to study aging on
earth?''
</P>
<P>
   One place to start such a study might be at Providence-Mount St.
Vincent, a five-story building surrounded by gardens at the top of
a hill overlooking Elliott Bay. The Mount, as those who live there
call it, is widely regarded to be what many Americans consider an
impossibility: a good nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   As well as the Mount works, though, it cannot alter the stark
realities of aging that its residents confront every day: the
spouses, friends and even children outlived; the physical
limitations; the loss of independence and control. These are men
and women who survived the Depression; who fought in World War II;
who worked as farmers, teachers, office managers, bus drivers and
engineers; who raised families and ran houses; who now need help to
go to the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   As nursing homes change and adapt under the pressure of managed
care and Medicaid rules, even the visionary administrator behind
the Mount, Robert Ogden, says it would be preferable for nursing
homes to cease to exist _ for people to be able to remain at home
or in some other setting in their community. And alternatives are
increasingly available.
</P>
<P>
   But meanwhile, with nearly half of all Americans who reach 65
expected to spend time in a nursing home, health care professionals
are looking to the Mount and a handful of places like it for
answers.
</P>
<P>
   Its current administrator, Charlene Boyd, says there is no
reason the Mount cannot be duplicated. Money is a factor, she
acknowledged; at about $60,000 a year, the Mount costs about
$10,000 more than the national average. Yet half of its residents
depend on Medicaid. More important is breaking free of rigid rules
and routines that assume residents are helpless.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Mount is the last community for most of its
residents, what is possible within a limited budget? How good can
the end of the road be?
</P>
<P>
   The residents of the Mount are not the so-called active senior
generation, the attractive silver-haired people celebrated in the
media playing golf and going on cruises. The lucky ones among them
are those who can walk, with walkers, and those who, as the
residents put it, ``have all their marbles.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to lump them together: a group of men and women in
wheelchairs, a few staring vacantly, others nodding off. Even those
who are fully aware are often unable, because of impairments, to
show by their expressions or gestures just how alive they are.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Thode, the recreation coordinator, and other staff
members take pains to point out each individual. That 92-year old,
the one moaning ``Oh dear, oh dear,'' lived in a sod house in
Alaska with her husband during World War II. The 81-year-old whose
stroke left her struggling to utter a sentence? She once was an
international toastmistress. The 83-year-old tethered to a feeding
tube, who on some days doesn't know where he is, happens to be a
much loved husband and father, who last week sat clutching a letter
from his son, telling how his seventh-grade son had just gone to
his first school dance with a girl.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, the Mount was exactly the sort of place
everyone dreaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very traditional nursing home _ very institutional,
very cold,'' said Ogden, who became the administrator in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The Mount's nursing home was opened by the Sisters of Providence
in 1967, the beginning of a mass construction of nursing homes
across the country financed by a new federal health care program
for the poor, Medicaid. For lack of any other model, these new
institutions, something more than rest homes or old-age homes, were
patterned after hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   With Medicaid guaranteeing income, the care of the frail elderly
became big business. And the dramatic increase in longevity,
combined with the transformation in society brought by increasing
mobility and women going to work, meant a growing need for
institutional care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody ever used to think of putting their grandparents in a
nursing home,'' said Maureen Gladstone, 62, a nurse on the fifth
floor whose grandmother lived with her family when she was growing
up. ``She helped raise us. Then when she got older, we took care of
her.''
</P>
<P>
   In the old Mount, everything revolved around the staff members
and their schedules. The day shift arrived at 6 a.m. and started
getting everyone up for breakfast, whether they wanted to or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know any better,'' said Ogden, who is now a regional
director of long-term care and housing for the Sisters of
Providence. ``Our definition of care was to protect people to the
point where they had no freedom, no dignity. We didn't want them to
fall. We didn't want to be hurt by anything. The best thing we
could think of to do was to put them away.''
</P>
<P>
   State regulators gave the Mount top ratings. That was how things
worked in nursing homes, and how they still work in many.
</P>
<P>
   As speculators and profiteers rushed into the business,
conditions in the worst nursing homes led to scandals that helped
shape Americans' fear of nursing homes. The scandals also prompted
Congress to enact the 1987 Nursing Home Reform Law. Conditions
slowly began to improve. Some health professionals began to talk
about a new way of looking at nursing homes, one stressing the
quality of residents' lives.
</P>
<P>
   At the Mount, by then operated by the nonprofit Sisters of
Providence Health System, Ogden and his assistant, Charlene Boyd,
who has since succeeded him, began working with a team to carry out
the new philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Each floor was divided into ``neighborhoods'' of about 20
residents each with their own dining room and kitchen. Anyone could
get a snack or a cup of coffee at any time. White walls were
painted pastel shades and hung with art. Floors were carpeted.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Residents were no longer automatically tied down at night in the
name of protecting them. ``The nurses came unglued,'' Ogden said.
``They said the patients might fall out of bed. Some did. We picked
them up and put them back. They slept better.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical diets calibrated down to the last gram of sugar and salt
were thrown out or modified. ``I went back to the docs and said,
`Does this really matter?' '' Ogden said. ``They said, `No, not if
you're 85.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone predicted disaster when Ogden decided to unlock the
56-bed Alzheimer's ward on the fourth floor and mix its residents
with everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty percent of the social workers walked out,'' said one
aide, Tamara Allen, who vehemently opposed the move but now is so
sold on the change that she gives speeches about it at conferences.
``We just couldn't imagine how it would be.''
</P>
<P>
   That there were problems with the old way, she could not deny.
In her trademark speech, she describes the caste system that still
operates in many nursing homes: ``Independent residents look down
on the residents that need help, and they in turn look down on the
residents who are confused.''
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Gladstone, the nurse, recalled the fears of ``the alerts
and non-agitateds'' _ jargon for those without dementia. ``I asked
them, `What is it about them that bothers you?' '' she said. ``They
were afraid they'd be that way. It's like a mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   But chaos did not erupt. On the contrary, Alzheimer's patients
became less agitated. When those who seemed likely to wander off
were fitted with ankle bracelets that would signal when they were
leaving, and through which door, ``They didn't seem to roam
around,'' Ms. Gladstone said. ``Just the idea that they could go
wherever they wanted _ they didn't want to anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Adjusting to a nursing home can be more difficult for those who
are not demented.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago Ruth Skoog, a former freelance writer for The
Seattle Times, had an apartment of her own in the assisted-living
half of the Mount. She was a big wheel, serving on the
all-important food committee and the residents council and joining
all the organized outings. Then back-to-back strokes partly
paralyzed her and she crossed the hall into the nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   The other evening Mrs. Skoog was at dinner on the third floor.
``She's got all her marbles,'' she said, paying the ultimate
compliment to the woman in the wheelchair beside her, Ann
Hasslinger, a former marathon runner who, at a youthful 43, has
advanced multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   The same could not be said of many of the women, in their 80s
and 90s, around them. ``This is appalling,'' Mrs. Skoog said. ``If
my husband could see me now, he would die. He hated to visit his
own mother in the nursing home.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Skoog wishes there were more people she could talk to, and
yet she carries on. She questions aides closely about life outside
the Mount. Ms. Heath even says her complaining is a sign of health.
As the former Miss West Seattle went off in her wheelchair for her
weekly hair appointment, she said, ``One has to keep up one's
image.''
</P>
<P>
   Nursing homes look different to people depending on their age,
their health, their stage of life. In their 70s, Dick and Esther
Gorman made a pledge: No nursing homes. But when the couple turned
80 together, they began down a path that would lead them to an
assisted-living apartment at the Mount _ and the understanding that
someday they might move across the corridor, to the nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to all their friends, Gorman related why they
began searching for a final home and what they learned. Their
health, ``while very good was starting to show signs of changes
typical of eighty year olds,'' he wrote. ``Although we were quite
sound organically, it had become apparent we were experiencing some
memory loss, loss of energy, occasional confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Visiting retirement communities and assisted-living facilities,
including the Mount, ``we found each had its share of quite
disabled people and that frequently they would be sitting
(sometimes sprawled out and/or asleep) in the lobby. This was
culture shock for us, seeing all these old people.''
</P>
<P>
   They decided not to move until they absolutely had to _ but soon
they reconsidered. Looking at themselves more closely, he wrote,
``we began to see that we weren't that far away from being those
old people whose presence upset us.'' In June 1997 they moved to
the Mount.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, 18 residents the Gormans knew have died. ``There's a
sort of unspoken agreement among people who are here that mortality
is real, but nothing to worry about,'' said Gorman, who is
president of the assisted-living residents council. ``You have to
consider that a part of living is deteriorating.''
</P>
<P>
   And now that he makes regular visits to the nursing home to
visit friends, including Mrs. Skoog, he says it no longer holds the
horror that it once did. ``We're all heading in that direction,''
he said.

LORDS DEFY COMMONS AND LABOR SEES RED 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A more unlikely band of guerrillas cannot be imagined
than the ermine-caped members of Britain's House of Lords.
</P>
<P>
   But in a series of rebellious acts this month, the venerable
senior body has blocked passage of a key government bill and vowed
to sabotage legislative procedures to keep the disputed measure
from becoming law when a new parliamentary session opens this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Lords has voted down and returned the legislation to the
House of Commons five times, a record of defiance that sent
historians back centuries to find precedents and that has hardened
the determination of Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor government
to crack down on the peers next year.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was a bill to change procedures in elections of
British representatives in the European Parliament in Strasbourg
passed by the House of Commons and sent on to the Lords for the
traditional contemplative endorsement. The upper body has the power
only to delay, not defeat, legislation passed by the Commons, but
such concerted disruption as this runs contrary to custom.
</P>
<P>
   The real impulse behind the rebellion was Blair's resolve to
strip hereditary peers of their right to vote in the Lords. The
decision will be formally revealed in the annual announcement of
the government's legislative program read by the queen at the
ceremonial opening of the new Parliament on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Lords is not elected but instead has 435 life peers
chosen by prime ministers and 750 dukes, earls, marquesses,
viscounts and barons, whose rights to vote in the chamber are
passed down from generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
   It is this latter, largely Conservative, group that is Blair's
target, and his government said that their role in reversing a
Commons majority in the voting rights legislation dramatized the
argument that they are unqualified, undeserving and anachronistic.
``They can use the Tory majority they have in the upper house to
scupper us and that is what they have done,'' Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman at 10 Downing St. called them a ``democratic
disgrace,'' and added, ``The truth is that the Tory hereditary
peers can be wheeled out on any day of the week on any issue to
defeat the democratically elected government.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreshadowing the confrontation expected in the new Parliament,
Home Secretary Jack Straw said, ``The Tories will rue the day they
overreached themselves in this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Known as the ``closed list'' form, it is more restrictive than
the procedures used in most other European countries and has drawn
criticism as typical of the Labor government's tendency to keep its
party members in line.
</P>
<P>
   William Hague, leader of the Tories, has denounced the proposal,
saying it gives parties too much control and robs voters of their
right to vote for individual candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say it is wrong, that it is undemocratic and that it has
never been the way we have done things in this country,'' he said.
``We were opposed to it yesterday, we are still opposed to it today
and they will find we will continue to be opposed to it in the
future. We are not going to cooperate or acquiesce in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   This strategy can irritate and inconvenience but not ultimately
turn back Labor, which has a 179-seat majority in the Commons and
can resort to little used and complicated parliamentary tactics to
force the Lords' hand. Or the Lords could now pass the legislation
and then tie it up for weeks with meddlesome amendments.
</P>
<P>
   The blocking tactics of the peers may be aimed at delaying
reforms long enough to leave the government too little time to put
procedures in place for the June 9, 1999, European elections. They
will also cause disruption since Labor has already assembled its
candidate list under the new regional candidate selection process
it fully expected to be in place.
</P>
<P>
   While the already weak and divided Tories and their unproven
leaders can win this short-term advantage, they run the longer term
risk of appearing to be solely obstructionist. Labor has already
started a campaign to portray them as feckless and self-defeating,
with Straw saying, ``This is a victory for the kamikaze tendency of
the Tory party.''
</P>
<P>
   Lord Weatherill, a former Conservative speaker of the House of
Commons, who is against the bill, nevertheless expressed concern
that Hague's strategy of uncompromising opposition could backfire.
``What will be remembered,'' he said, ``is that this unelected
House frustrated the will of the Commons on five occasions.''

 &HT;    Clarence Clemons: The big man remembers the glory days
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Clarence Clemons is sitting in a cramped
backstage corner of Christines, a Jupiter club where the rock sax
legend holds court every Tuesday evening. He's dripping sweat,
sipping a Cosmopolitan. The first set of the night has gone well.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to talk about The Boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bruce who?'' Clemons kids a visitor. But the 56-year-old
ex-football player, dubbed the Big Man by his musical colleagues,
knows better. After all, it was as a member of Springsteen's E
Street band from 1972 to 1989 that Clemons earned his fame. And now
that Springsteen is back in the news _ with the release of Tracks,
a four-CD box set, and the announcement of his induction into the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame _ it's a good time to catch up with the
saxophonist who helped define the Springsteen sound.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the fact that Springsteen paid a little visit to
Clemons' Singer Island home a couple of weeks ago. The two did what
old rock buddies do: Clemons, an aspiring chef, cooked Springsteen
a couple of his specialties; Springsteen joined Clemons on stage at
his other weekly gig on Wednesday night at 251 Sunrise in Palm
Beach (talk about your guest artists!).
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just a sit-down time for the both of us, to hang out
like we used to,'' says Clemons. ``He's never been in my neck of
the woods here, so I wanted to show him what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   That included his new band, an all-star team of South Florida
veterans that Clemons is bringing into the studio in a month. His
violinist, Randi Fishenfeld, a country-style fiddler with a
rocker's passion, particularly caught Springsteen's attention.
Clemons doesn't want to ignite speculation about her joining the E
Street Band on a rumored reunion tour, but he doesn't rule out the
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping he would (think about it),'' he says, noting that
Springsteen has featured a violin in the band before.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, all instruments are welcome in the free-for-all
celebration that is the E Street Band. But as the Tracks set
attests, none is perhaps more prominent than Clemons' soul-laced
saxophone. Listening to the anthology's 66 songs, most previously
unreleased, you hear a band coalesce from bar-room beginnings to
stadium-era glory _ with Clemons punctuating one tune after another
with his beefy solos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like reliving your life all over again,'' the
saxophonist says of his first reaction to the set.
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen wasn't necessarily looking for a sax player when
Clemons walked into the Asbury Park, N.J., bar where a meeting had
been arranged by a mutual friend. As Clemons tells it, he opened
the door and a gust of wind literally blew it off in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked in and asked him if I could sit, and he was too
scared to say no,'' Clemons recalls with a laugh, imagining how he
must have seemed like the Incredible Hulk. (At 6 feet 3 inches,
he's a towering presence even when the door stays on its hinges.)
</P>
<P>
   The two clicked instantly. ``We were both looking for something
_ the missing element,'' Clemons says, noting how the saxophone was
a regular feature of rock bands in the '50s. The increased emphasis
on the electric guitar changed that. ``It was more powerful and had
more drive,'' Clemons adds. ``The saxophone ... couldn't compete.''
</P>
<P>
   But given Springsteen and the E Street Band's wide range _ from
rockabilly to stadium rock _ a sax was necessary. ``It adds an
urban element,'' Clemons explains. ``You can touch a lot more bases
than you would without it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, while Clemons may be responsible for tooting his own
horn, it's Springsteen who directs the band. Those well-placed sax
solos are exactly that _ well-placed as part of Springsteen's
design. ``I don't play the sax constantly,'' Clemons says, noting
that he also plays percussion. ``I'm a color to his (Springsteen's)
pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, Clemons' contributions to Tracks are reflective of the
old-fashioned rock tradition of Little Richard and Chuck Berry. In
early party songs like Give the Girl a Kiss and So Young and In
Love, he doesn't play so much as he growls, giving the music a
sexual edge.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the eight-minute reverie known as Thundercrack.
Clemons expresses amazement that Springsteen could write ``an
opera'' on a subject as trivial as how a woman dances. ``He's a
great storyteller, he takes something so simple and makes it so
complicated,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   By the third disc in the chronologically ordered set, one hears
a more mature, sophisticated Springsteen _ and Clemons' sax
reflects the change. Frankie, a seven-minute bittersweet ballad
that Clemons calls ``a pretty intense song,'' features a pointed,
soaring sax solo just at the end. ``You feel it, you know it's
going to come, you want it,'' Clemons says.
</P>
<P>
   Where the Bands Are, from the second disc, offers what might be
termed the quintessential Clemons solo, big and bold down to the
last eighth note. ``That's my second favorite song (on the set).''
At the same time, he wouldn't mind having another crack at that
solo _ and some others. ``Because when you're doing it on a first
or second take, you're just beginning to feel it,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   As for Clemons' favorite song, that honor goes to Sad Eyes from
the fourth disc, a number he doesn't even play on. Clemons simply
enjoys the Roy Orbison-influenced tune. ``Roy Orbison was a big fan
(of Springsteen's). He used to follow us around Europe,'' Clemons
notes.
</P>
<P>
   The big question that remains is whether Tracks will prompt an E
Street Reunion. Clemons is pretty confident. The band already
worked together a couple of years ago when Springsteen recorded new
material for a greatest-hits compilation. (Clemons' sweet sax
playing on Secret Garden was a highlight of the added songs.)
</P>
<P>
   And while the band will not be inducted with Springsteen at the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremonies _ a technicality because they
were not properly credited on Springsteen's first album _ the
chances are good they will join him on stage for a number.
</P>
<P>
   But anything beyond that remains up to Springsteen. Or as
Clemons likes to say, ``He is The Boss.''

 &HT;    Storefront designer creates splendor in the glass
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Monday, Nov. 23
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Simon Doonan wanted to visit Palm Beach
last week. He really, truly did.
</P>
<P>
   But there was this big car crash between Miami, where he was,
and here, and traffic was so bad, and he had a party at the Delano
in the evening ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm deeply traumatized,'' he said, once he got to a phone.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way Doonan talks. Dramatic. Thrilling. Deliberate and
English, like he's licking crumbs from his fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   He sounds like a flamboyant window dresser, which is just what
he is.
</P>
<P>
   Doonan dresses the windows at Barney's department store in New
York. Doesn't sound like something that would make a person famous.
Put clothes on mannequins. Sweep floor.
</P>
<P>
   But Doonan has fun. His first big hit in window-dressing was a
group of mannequins in tuxedos sitting among trash cans, with
taxidermic rats scrambling over them. The rats were wearing
rhinestone bracelets around their necks.
</P>
<P>
   At Barney's, Doonan collaborates with artists for his windows.
He does whole-window caricatures of Madonna, Martha Stewart, George
Hamilton. The Hamilton window had a mannequin sunbathing next to a
``Tan-enbaum'' Christmas tree.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's written a book, Confessions of a Window Dresser: Tales
from a life in fashion (Penguin, $40). He's on his book tour.
</P>
<P>
   After apologizing about four times for not visiting, he
submitted to some off-the-cuff questions.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Have you been to Palm Beach before?
</P>
<P>
   A.: Oh, yes. Vera Wang was the first to rave on about it. She
has a pink house there. She's Palm Beach's biggest ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: What are you doing next?
</P>
<P>
   A.: Well, my book tour just started. I think this is my 15
minutes of fame and I'm about seven minutes through it. Several
people want the book movie rights.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Will you star?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I'm a bit too old, I think (he's 46). They should cast
someone like Mike Myers. Or they should get someone really butch,
like Clint Eastwood or Jean-Claude Van Damme.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Have you ever starred in one of your windows?
</P>
<P>
   A.: Right now I'm in the windows at Madison Avenue. We have this
funny old resuscitation mannequin, like for CPR. It looked like me,
so we propped it up with a typewriter. It's so much fun _ it's the
ultimate ego trip.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: I saw you were one of the critics for People magazine's
best- and worst-dressed issue.
</P>
<P>
   A.: That didn't necessarily reflect me. I think the people voted
based on good taste, and you shouldn't do that for performers.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Who do you think are the best dressers?
</P>
<P>
   A.: Madonna. She always wears new stuff. Sharon Stone. I like
performers who don't necessarily look chic but have a point of
view. For example, Dolly Parton looks great. Puff Daddy dresses in
a certain amount of excess, and that's great. Too many people are
dressing like junior Vogue editors with little Prada bags. You
should have bravado.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: And who are the worst dressers?
</P>
<P>
   A.: There are some who haven't figured it out yet. Like Emma
Thompson. I'm reluctant to name names because they're Barney's
customers. You could say, `Simon was terrified at saying.'
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Any Palm Beach people you'd like to put in a window?
</P>
<P>
   A.: It would be great to do a crowd scene of Palm Beach
characters, throw them all in.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: What would that look like?
</P>
<P>
   A.: A vast living room with huge tables and huge bowls of fruit,
and a ceramic zebra in the corner. Giant ceramic urns. Chartreuse
bamboo with velvet upholstery. And huge ceramic animals everywhere.
Patterns of florals and chintz. Another look could be plexiglass
with beige, like a '70s Palm Beach. I like the really overdone
look.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Why don't you do it?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I don't see why not. I could do Saratoga, Palm Beach, the
Upper East Side _ where the society people spend time. Aspen.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: It's almost Christmas time. Any home decorating tips?
</P>
<P>
   A.: The key is abundance. If you have a wreath with balls, make
sure there are hundreds of balls. If you have a snowman, make it
huge. Avoid plastic light-up lawn ornaments. That's a bit cheesy
for Palm Beach. I do like it myself. You should have a giant
Christmas tree in the yard smothered with lights. And there should
be one dominant thing on the tree. Martha Stewart did popcorn balls
in cellophane. I have to say Martha Stewart does the best Christmas
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: What are you doing for New Year's?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I'm going to Peru. My boyfriend is a potter and he has a
little factory down there. We went last year. It's great getting
away from it all, sitting in a shed while parrots fly around.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: What's your favorite outfit?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I have a lot of clothes by Helmut Lang. He cuts well for
small people. A lot of Prada. I'm very trendy.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: How tall are you?
</P>
<P>
   A.: Well, now you're thinking I'm four-foot-three. I am
five-five. My passport says I'm five-four and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Which one is right?
</P>
<P>
   A.: Let's say five-five. I'll go get some elevated shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Anything else? Want to say `Hi' to anyone here?
</P>
<P>
   A.: To the Palm Beachers, I just applaud their sense of style.
They should never lose that. They should never go to flip-flops.

 &HT;    Tennille brings broader comedy to role as `Victor/Victoria'
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Toni Tennille, starring in the national
tour of the Broadway musical, Victor/Victoria? Isn't she the
distaff half of the Captain &AMP; Tennille, last heard embarrassing
President Ford by singing Muskrat Love at the White House?
</P>
<P>
   True, but she once wrote her own musical, an ecology-themed show
called Mother Earth that played Broadway in 1972. Briefly.
</P>
<P>
   It closed after 12 performances, a trauma that kept the
55-year-old Tennille from theater until recently. ``It was very,
very heart-breaking,'' Tennille says by phone from Nevada, where
she was nursing a sinus infection. ``It's been such a long time
since Mother Earth, you'd think I'd be over it by now.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if that were the end of the story, we wouldn't bother
telling it. During the show's tryout in San Francisco, Tennille met
a keyboardist named Daryl Dragon, nicknamed The Captain because of
his penchant for nautical hats. After Mother Earth tanked, they
became a team in nightclubs and in private. They rose to
Grammy-winning stardom, harmonizing on love songs _ both the
Muskrat variety and the kind that Will Keep Us Together.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon and Tennille still criss-cross the country with their
largely nostalgic act, but more and more she has branched out into
big band concerts and solo albums. And lately, the Alabama-born
songstress began itching to try a musical again.
</P>
<P>
   Victor/Victoria, which opens Tuesday evening at the Kravis
Center, is the gender-bending tale of a down-on-her-luck diva
forced to impersonate a man who dresses and sings like a woman. It
began as a 1982 Blake Edwards movie starring his wife, Julie
Andrews. In 1995, it jumped to the stage, again directed by Edwards
and starring Andrews. Although the show got brutal reviews on
Broadway, every bit as bad as Mother Earth's, Tennille contacted
the producers about replacing Andrews. They opted for Raquel Welch.
But when it came to the national tour, they tapped Tennille.
</P>
<P>
   Tennille says the show has been tightened since New York, but
the prime difference is her interpretation. In contrast to Andrews'
reserved approach, Tennille goes for broader comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I do `Le Jazz Hot' and `Louis Says' as Victor, Victor is
not a woman, Victor is a drag queen,'' she notes. ``So you have to
take the drag queen motto, which is `Why do, when you can overdo.'
So everything is very over-the-top, so to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does she attempt to parrot Andrews' British accent. Instead,
she decided her character is from the American South.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a whole story for her in my mind,'' Tennille says.
``She grew up in a little town in Alabama. Actually, we're using
Eufaula instead of Montgomery, where I was born, because Eufaula is
funnier, Blake thought. Her mother was a classical piano teacher
and her father was a very, very good tenor who had wanted to be an
opera singer, but circumstances prevented him from doing that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see Victoria as being exposed to the new jazz music and
really loving that. Because of her parents, she chooses the
classical side and ends up touring Europe with a very small light
opera company.''
</P>
<P>
   The history is made up, but Tennille says there are similarities
to herself. ``My mother did play classical piano, not that well.
And actually, my father sang with the big bands _ he sang with Bob
Crosby's band _ but he had to give up show business when his father
died. He had to come back to Montgomery and take over the furniture
store.''
</P>
<P>
   She can also relate to Victoria's early desperation to succeed,
or at least make a living as a singer. ``Oh, yeah, because Daryl
and I worked in the clubs for very small money when we first
started out,'' she says. ``In 1972 through '74, right before we hit
it big, we were hauling our own equipment into the club and setting
up and playing for, I don't know, a hundred bucks a night.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, unlike Victoria, who is not above causing a disturbance
in a restaurant to finagle a free meal, Tennille cannot think of
anything so wild. ``I am just the most boring person you will ever
meet. I'm the good Southern daughter. I'm not outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   But isn't it outrageous that anyone would mistake the striking
redhead for a man? ``I don't think they've really mistaken anybody
who's played the part,'' she says. ``I think I probably physically
am fairly well-suited, because I am tall and I'm skinny and I'm
small busted. So I don't even need that squash-down thing that
Julie had to have to squash her breasts down.''
</P>
<P>
   And Raquel? ``Well, puh-leeze. I mean, I didn't see it, but I
can't even imagine where she put those things when she put that tux
on.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Tennille feels comfortable in the show and once
she shakes her sinus problems, she'll be able to relax and enjoy
the tour. Nevertheless, she has the final date _ June 1999 _
circled on her calendar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I'm going to do is take two months off,'' she
says with a sigh. ``I'm going to do nothing but hike in the hills,
play golf, see my friends and just enjoy being at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Home is near Lake Tahoe, and July there is ``a golf month,
believe me.'' After two months off, she'll be ready for some
symphony dates and to roll out Captain &AMP; Tennille again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually the year 2000 is our 25th anniversary of doing
Captain &AMP; Tennille,'' she says. ``I can't believe it. It's like,
how is this possible?''
</P>
<P>
   The silver anniversary of the act is also Tennille and Dragon's
silver wedding anniversary. The two events are not coincidental.
``My mother had been after us to get married, because we were
living together for three years,'' Tennille recalls. By the summer
of '75, as Love Will Keep Us Together reigned as the No. 1 song
hit, they no longer had the excuse of being too broke to wed.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, love has kept them together, though Victor/Victoria has
been keeping them apart lately. Dragon tends to fly in and see his
wife every three weeks. While she is busy with the show, he has
been helping Al Jardine of the Beach Boys, acting as musical
director for a new group called Beach Boys Family &AMP; Friends,
putting ``a fresh approach to the Beach Boys sound.'' (Both Dragon
and Tennille played on Beach Boys records in the '70s.)
</P>
<P>
   The not-so-hidden agenda for Tennille's 40-week trek with
Victor/Victoria has been to convince Broadway producers that she
can carry a show. ``I think I'm at the top of my game now,'' she
says. ``I would say the next big challenge would be if I were to
open a show in New York on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   And if one didn't come along that was right? ``Actually,'' she
says, ``I'll just write my own show.''

 &HT;    Clinton urges Korean detente
 &HT;    By Bob Deans
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Holding out the prospect of a new dawn for
one of the world's last remaining pariah states, President Clinton
lent a dramatic endorsement Saturday to Seoul's efforts to build
new partnerships with communist North Korea, one of the most
reclusive regimes on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   As he has done repeatedly in recent days, Clinton called on
North Korea to open a suspected nuclear materials site to U.S.
inspectors and to end ballistic missile test launches, warning that
the matters are ``cause for deep concern.''
</P>
<P>
   He also extended an olive branch to the communist regime in
Pyongyang, however, embracing South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's
policy of erecting cultural, political and commercial bridges
across the Cold War divide that has split this ancient land between
north and south through half a century of enmity and war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support President Kim's policy of gradual engagement with
North Korea,'' Clinton told reporters during a joint press
conference following a summit meeting with Kim. ``I think it is a
wise policy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the most animated moment of the half-hour news conference,
Clinton illustrated the opportunities engagement presents to North
Korea, as symbolized by the journey of a South Korean cruise ship
that is, this weekend, ferrying the first-ever large group of
tourists to travel from capitalist South Korea to the communist
North.
</P>
<P>
   ``To us, this was amazing,'' Clinton said, ``and it was a very
beautiful picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton contrasted that with the menacing image of a vast
underground military construction site in the North that the White
House suspects is being built to house a nuclear reactor capable of
producing enriched uranium, the raw material for atomic bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing could ever be put in that hole in the ground that
would give the North Koreans as much advantage, as much power, as
much wealth, as much happiness as more of those ships going up
there full of people from here,'' said Clinton. ``That is the most
important message I would like to leave with you today.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether to engage with or to isolate states that
don't play by international rules has formed one of the most
enduring policy debates of Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Communist Cuba, for example, remains in a sort of U.S.-imposed
quarantine, diplomatically and economically isolated by sanctions
that have been in place for nearly four decades.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has broad and expanding links to communist
China, however, a model of the approach that engagement advocates
say will deepen U.S. influence and serve to moderate Beijing's more
oppressive instincts.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. approach has been decidedly different for North Korea,
the target of the longest-standing and most comprehensive set of
punitory sanctions the United States has ever imposed on another
country.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton embarked on carefully calibrated engagement with North
Korea four years ago, when his administration brokered a deal to
freeze, and ultimately dismantle, Pyongyang's alleged nuclear
weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Clinton administration has engaged North Korea
in ongoing negotiations centered on confidence-building measures
that might ultimately lead to a formal end to the state of war that
technically exists between the two Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   On yet a third track, the Clinton administration is conducting
talks with North Korea concerning ways to bridle Pyongyang's
ballistic missile program.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, those efforts represent a sea change in U.S.
relations with North Korea, so much so that the Congress has
mandated a White House review of its policy, a task Clinton has
delegated to former Defense Secretary William Perry.
</P>
<P>
   In aligning himself with Kim's own engagement approach, referred
to in Korea as a ``sunshine policy,'' Clinton appeared to step
closer to working with the unpredictable North, which, despite the
movement of the past several years, remains one of the most
closeted regimes anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   It's far from clear whether North Korea's authoritarian regime
is interested in embracing the outside world. While Pyongyang has
agitated for a lifting of U.S. economic and diplomatic sanctions,
the regime is dogged by contradictory fears that opening the
country to outside influences could mark the beginning of the end
of its own authority.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean President Kim, however, has spent his first nine
months in office advocating engagement as the surest route to
dispelling a generation of animosity and distrust between Koreans
on both sides of the border, which Kim hopes to one day see
reunified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have patiently and consistently pushed such a policy,'' Kim
said during a toast Saturday night at a state dinner in Clinton's
honor. ``The result is gradually emerging now. North Korea is
cautiously, but noticeably, taking measures to increase interaction
and cooperation between the South and the North.''
</P>
<P>
   Formed 50 years ago by the Soviet Union as a counter to the
U.S.-backed government in the South, North Korea has been virtually
walled off from the rest of the world through a combination of its
own secrecy and self-imposed isolation and an overarching set of
U.S.-imposed sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has never had official diplomatic relations with the
United States, which has not formally recognized it as a legitimate
state. Americans are strictly forbidden to do most types of
business with North Korea under U.S. laws that prohibit trading
with the nation's enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Some 54,000 Americans died combating North Korea and its Chinese
allies during the 1950-1953 Korean War. And the United States still
keeps 37,000 American troops in South Korea to help guard against
possible attack by North Korea's million-man army, much of which is
combat-ready and forward deployed along the heavily fortified
border that divides the nation less than 30 miles north of Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of its Soviet benefactor seven years ago has left
North Korea virtually alone in an increasingly integrated world,
while the failings of its central controls have exhausted its
economy and driven many of its 22 million people to the brink of
starvation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to spend Sunday visiting with U.S. troops
in Korea, before leaving later for the U.S. island possession of
Guam. He plans to spend the day there before returning to
Washington Monday night.

PRESIDENT SPEAKS SOFTLY ON IRAQ AND KOREAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ President Clinton made an unusual, direct
appeal to North Korea on Saturday to set aside any nuclear
ambitions in favor of strengthening ties to South Korea and the
United States. The appeal came during a meeting with reporters at
which he also counseled patience over Iraq's refusal to comply with
a request from weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important that we not overreact here on the first
day,'' Clinton said in response to reports that Iraq had balked at
a request by U.N. inspectors for documents on its weapons program.
But, speaking at a joint appearance with South Korean President Kim
Dae Jung, Clinton called the requested documents ``quite
important'' and said Iraq had ``some affirmative obligations'' to
help weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Clinton denied that his comments represented any
softening toward Iraq. They said that because the situation was
still developing and the president was preparing for meetings with
Kim he had not been briefed in detail on Iraq's resistance when he
appeared before reporters Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said the administration
was consulting with other members of the U.N. Security Council
about the matter. If Iraq fails to meet its obligations under U.N.
resolutions, he said, ``We obviously are prepared to act.''
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Clinton called off a strike against Iraq minutes
before it was to begin, delayed his departure for Asia to monitor
the crisis and said that U.S. forces remained poised to strike if
Iraq reneged on its agreement to let U.N. weapons inspectors do
their work.
</P>
<P>
   In his appearance with Kim, the president addressed a handful of
questions that ranged from North Korea to Indonesia to whether the
Congress should punish him over the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Washington for this five-day trip to Japan, Korea
and Guam, he drew a parallel between the governments of Iraq and
North Korea, saying, ``We must be no less concerned by North
Korea's weapons activities.'' The Clinton administration is
urgently seeking to inspect a vast construction site in North Korea
that it believes may be the beginnings of a nuclear weapons plant.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Clinton called that site, together with North Korea's
test firing in August of a missile over Japan, ``cause for deep
concern.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration is trying a very different
approach toward North Korea than toward Iraq, partly at the urging
of Kim, who is pursuing a ``sunshine policy'' of engagement with
the North. As Clinton and Kim delivered prepared statements and
answered questions Saturday, Clinton became most animated in
describing what he called ``a very beautiful picture'' that he
happened to spot after turning on his hotel television on arriving
in Seoul on Friday night: film of a cruise ship recently permitted
to carry South Koreans on a tour into the North.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask the North Koreans to think about this,'' he said,
arguing that Kim's policy of engagement with the North presented
them with a great opportunity. ``Nothing could ever be put in that
hole in the ground that would give the North Koreans as much
advantage, as much power, as much wealth, as much happiness as more
of those ships going up there full of people from here.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Clinton administration fears that the construction site may
be evidence that North Korea has abandoned a 1994 pledge to the
United States to give up its nuclear weapons program in exchange
for billions of dollars in aid.
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans have denied that the complex is intended to
help build nuclear weapons. But they have demanded that the United
States pay $300 million to inspect it, a request rejected this week
by a U.S. delegation to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. The
new complex is being built on a mountainside about 25 miles
northeast of Yongbyon, the former North Korean nuclear research
center.
</P>
<P>
   Kim continued Saturday to emphasize his hopes for a new opening
toward North Korea. But he said, ``We will not tolerate any
possible attempt of North Korea to proliferate nuclear weapons,
missiles and other weapons of mass destruction.'' The Clinton
administration plans to resume negotiating with North Korea over
inspecting the site in December.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to strategies for easing the Asian financial crisis,
Clinton discussed North Korea during a visit to Tokyo on Thursday
and Friday. The subject of North Korea consumed most of his two
hours of meetings with Kim here Saturday at the Blue House, which
contains the Korean president's office and home.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been criticized in Congress and in this
region for letting its policy on North Korea drift, but Clinton
called that policy a ``clear-eyed mix'' of diplomacy and
deterrence.
</P>
<P>
   He said that so far the 1994 agreement had worked, because
without it ``North Korea already would have produced a sizable
amount of weapons-grade plutonium.''
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from congressional critics, Clinton last week
appointed William Perry, his former defense secretary, to review
his policy on North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   On other matters, Clinton declined to criticize the government
of Indonesia for using force to crack down on protesters there,
saying that he did not ``have enough facts at this moment to give
you the right answer.'' But he said he hoped there would be ``no
backsliding'' in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton followed his appearance with Kim with a visit to the
National Folk Museum here, where he conducted an hourlong
conversation with six Korean academics, businessmen and union
leaders about the troubled state of Korea's economy and its impact
on the society. He attended a state dinner Saturday night, before
stopping by a concert where his brother, Roger, a musician,
happened to be performing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton repeatedly congratulated Kim for his efforts at economic
reform, noting that interest rates had fallen here and the currency
had stabilized. But he also pressed Kim during their private
meetings to restructure the five huge conglomerates, or chaebols,
that account for some 40 percent of the Korean economy. In
describing the leaders' conversation, Berger called restructuring
the chaebols ``perhaps the most serious remaining problem in the
South Korean economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said during the economic forum Saturday afternoon that
he felt impatient about South Korea's failure to act on the
chaebols. It may be necessary to proceed slowly with the
restructuring, he said, ``but they should begin.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Clinton plans to visit some of the 37,000 American
troops stationed here.

 &HT;    Gun retailers preparing for shoppers' backlash against new law
 &HT;    By Jim Morris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Sporting goods stores and other shops that sell
guns are bracing for crowds and complaints this week as shoppers
try to beat a federal law that goes into effect Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   On that date, potential buyers of handguns, rifles and shotguns
must undergo a background check to see if they are permitted to buy
a gun.
</P>
<P>
   The National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) is
the result of the Brady Act of 1993. Until now, only those who
bought handguns required a background check. Now all guns, except
most muzzle-loaders, will be affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``This probably couldn't have come at a worse time for gun
dealers,'' said Evan English, owner of the Olde English Gun Shoppe
in Ginghamsburg. ``Not only is it hunting season, but that's also
the beginning of our Christmas shopping season. So it's going to
add to the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun dealers at first will be required to telephone the NICS
center, a division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, with the
potential gun buyer's Social Security number and other
identification. Later, the FBI says, computers will handle it all.
</P>
<P>
   With the system in place, the number of background checks for
gun purchases will increase to 12 million a year from 4 million,
federal officials estimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a real nightmare, especially in the beginning.''
English said. ``On a busy Saturday afternoon, calls will be coming
in from all over the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   English said he was told some background checks might take up to
three days if there is a glitch in the system or other problem
obtaining records.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we'll have to increase some man-hours to make the calls
or even hire someone to do it,'' English said.
</P>
<P>
   English said he is glad one aspect of the NICS program has
changed. Last month Congress rejected a $13-$15 charge for the
background checks, to be added to the price of each gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't going to be very fair,'' English observed. ``Now
it will be a cost absorbed by the federal government. If the
background checks are meant to protect society, then everyone
should be paying for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun dealers hope customers don't take out their frustrations on
store employees, especially if the system rejects them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to be the ones to take the heat,'' said
Jason McNinch, manager of Lev's Pawn Shop, 3551 Salem Ave. ``People
will get mad and I'll be the one who hears about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The law also requires pawn shops to do background checks on
people who pawn a gun, then go back to get it. The same is true for
people selling a gun by consignment at a gun shop.
</P>
<P>
   A gun dealer who sells a weapon without the checks would face
criminal prosecution, loss of his license, a fine, and possibly
prison.
</P>
<P>
   One area dealer, Roger Meyerhoeffer of Crawdaddy's Outdoor Store
in New Carlisle, said he might give up the gun business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't sell all that many guns in a year and I'm just
wondering if it's going to be worth the hassle,'' Meyerhoeffer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meyerhoeffer said he thinks the NICS system will drive more gun
sales underground.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will find other ways to get guns if they don't think
they can get by the background check,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Criminals aren't going to buy from gun shops, because of the
background checks,'' said Kevin Heeter, a gun enthusiast from West
Alexandria. ``But it's going to be just that much more red tape for
law-abiding gun owners.''
</P>
<P>
   Another gun owner said he thinks NICS could backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is potential for crime to increase because of
the new law,'' said Del Schindler, a veteran Dayton trapshooter.
``If criminals can no longer obtain guns legally, they will
probably try to steal guns more.''
</P>
<P>
   Darke County Sheriff Toby Spencer said the checks would be
``harder on the average citizens'' but do little to stop criminals
from getting the firearms they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will work,'' he said. ``There's too many
avenues for criminals to get guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery County Sheriff Gary Haines said he didn't expect
criminals to commit more burglaries to steal guns because of a
massive loophole in the Brady Act: Only registered dealers are
affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most gun sales are casual sales,'' Haines said. ``Criminals
don't get guns from gun stores.''
</P>
<P>
   For Brady to work, it would have to be more comprehensive,
Haines said, adding much more regulation _ and curtailing what most
gun owners view as basic constitutional protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it happening,'' he said. ``I think Americans will
not give up that right.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton this month acknowledged a loophole: The
requirement for background checks does not apply to gun show sales
by non-dealers, who must verify the age and address of the person
buying the gun.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ordered the Treasury and Justice departments to
recommend executive actions within 60 days to close the loophole to
stop 5,000 gun shows throughout the nation from becoming ''illegal
arms bazaars'' for criminals and gunrunners.
</P>
<P>
   The government estimates 5 million people a year attend gun
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Another change in the law _ elimination of a waiting period _
could put guns in the hands of hotheads, some critics suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Once the new system begins, background checks could be conducted
in 30 seconds to three minutes, according to Paul Bresson, an FBI
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   That would eliminate a five-day ``cooling-off period.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see where that could happen,'' said Chris Davey of the
Ohio attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Since the handgun background checks became mandatory, such
checks in Ohio have been handled by the attorney general's Bureau
of Criminal Investigation. On Nov. 30 it will turn over those
duties to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``There never really was a 'cooling off' period,'' Davey said.
``That was a misconception.'' Davey said background checks for
handgun purchases usually took about five days to complete.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Ingram, an associate professor of criminal law and criminal
procedure at the University of Dayton, said he doubted the hothead
theory. ``Most people at gun shows or firearms dealers are not
buying their first guns,'' he said, adding, ``There are other
avenues'' for someone who wants a gun in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   A Fairborn gun owner said he is more concerned with the
potential to create a ``big brother'' file by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of the government going ahead and keeping a file on
people who own guns could create a real problem,'' said Scott
Craft. ``I hope there is no intent to put together a data base.''
</P>
<P>
   Bresson said the law requires records about gun owners to be
destroyed within 180 days of a background check. Those who can't
purchase guns Following are reasons for which a person would not be
permitted to purchase a rifle, shotgun or handgun under the NICS
background check:
</P>
<P>
   A dishonorable discharge from military service.
</P>
<P>
   Renunciation of citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Mental defectives/commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Controlled substance abusers.
</P>
<P>
   Illegal/unlawful aliens.
</P>
<P>
   Wanted persons.
</P>
<P>
   Listed in the protection order file.
</P>
<P>
   Listed in the deported felon file.
</P>
<P>
   In U.S. Secret Service protective file.
</P>
<P>
   In the foreign fugitive file.
</P>
<P>
   Any state laws that can prevent the requester from obtaining the
firearm

 &HT;    Clinton says he is paying price for scandal
 &HT;    By Bob Deans
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ President Clinton said Saturday that it was
not his place to suggest a course of Congressional action to punish
him for his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, but he said he is
paying a price whether lawmakers discipline him further or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a lot of suffering,'' Clinton said. ``That is
different from punishment, although it's hard to see the difference
sometimes as you're going through it.''
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton, who has said his fate and judgment rests in the
hands of Congress and, ultimately, the hands of God, stressed that
his personal struggle over the sex and deception scandal has been
separate from his public battles over its fallout.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, this long ago ceased to be a political issue or a
legal issue and became a personal one,'' Clinton said. ``And every
day I do my best to put it right, personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, here as part of a five-day Asia swing, made the remarks
in response to a reporter's question at a press conference with
South Korean President Kim Dae Jung, in this country's presidential
residence, the Blue House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is simply not appropriate at this time, in my view, for me
to comment on what the Congress should do,'' Clinton said, after
being asked whether he had any suggestions as to how he might help
to put the matter behind. ``I trust the American people, and I hope
Congress will do the right thing in a nonpolitical way, if you
will, to get beyond the partisanship and go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky, a former White House
intern, is the subject of impeachment proceedings before the House
Judiciary Committee.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ President Clinton and his half-brother
Roger shared a moment as rock show Seoul-mates Saturday night, when
the leader of the free world dropped in on a concert to cheer his
younger sibling.
</P>
<P>
   Roger and his rock band were among a list of acts to appear at
what was billed as a U.S.-Korean Friendship Performance, coinciding
with Clinton's two-day visit to the South Korean capital.
</P>
<P>
   The president left a state dinner with President Kim Dae Jung
and stopped off at the Sejong Cultural Center in downtown Seoul,
where he stood backstage and listened as Roger belted out a pair of
songs.
</P>
<P>
   As the U.S. Commander in Chief stepped into the footlights to
give Roger a congratulatory hug, the audience of some 3,900
well-heeled aficionados rose for an enthusiastic ovation.
</P>

 &HT;    Ohio governor at center of complex probe over incenerator
 &HT;    WITH TIMELINE
 &HT;    By Steve Bennish and Ken McCall
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST LIVERPOOL, Ohio _ A plume of exhaust from a $160 million
hazardous waste incinerator is wafting far beyond this Ohio River
Valley town, clouding the final days of George Voinovich's eight
years as governor.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-year investigation that is likely to bleed into
Voinovich's first term as a U.S. Senator, federal authorities are
attempting to trace a complex trail. It leads from Waste Technology
Industries' high-tech and highly controversial incinerator to a now
defunct state-funded pollution monitoring agency, to a landfill
needed for construction of a county jail project.
</P>
<P>
   The trail also connects Paul Voinovich and lobbyist Anthony
Fabiano, whose clients included WTI. Fabiano's employment of union
leader Anthony Gallagher led to questionable expenditures during
the governor's 1994 re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Voinovich denies any impropriety and has promised to
cooperate fully with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this is all said and done, the governor's integrity will
be totally intact, and I'm totally confident that there will be a
finding of no wrongdoing,'' said state Republican Chairman Bob
Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   The sprawling investigation by elements of the FBI, IRS Criminal
Investigation Division, Department of Labor and a federal grand
jury in Cincinnati appears to be focusing on possible political and
governmental misdeeds in a corner of Ohio far from major city power
centers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Jefferson County seat of Steubenville, Sheriff Fred
Abdalla watches the unfolding saga. The investigation began with
his office and that of county rosecutor Stephen Stern before
federal authorities took up the probe.
</P>
<P>
   Abdalla said he began investigating allegations that former
North Ohio Valley Air Authority director Pasquale ``Patsy'' DeLuca
and employee Vincent Zumpano pressured local industries for payoffs
to settle regulatory problems. NOVAA had an $847,000 annual
contract with the state Ohio Environmental Protection Agency to
monitor air pollution in six counties until September of last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``NOVAA was responsible for any industry with a smoke stack in
the Ohio Valley,'' Abdalla said. ``We got information and
allegations there could be possible payoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Former NOVAA board chairman Frank Petrola said he helped
initiate various probes when he became aware of the allegations.
``The tentacles go way out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   DeLuca declined comment. ``I have no comment on any of that
stuff, `` he said. ``I have an attorney and am trying to get that
straightened out.''
</P>
<P>
   Zumpano couldn't be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Bribery conviction
</P>
<P>
   DeLuca hasn't been charged with any offense, but the grand jury
has issued subpoenas seeking documents ``pertaining to'' him.
Zumpano hasn't been charged in this case, but in 1997 he was
convicted of the attempted bribery of a Jefferson County
commissioner and received a six-month prison sentence. The 1993
bribery attempt, caught on tape by sheriff's investigators, was to
secure a jail construction management contract for the V Group, a
Cleveland-based construction firm headed by the governor's brother
Paul.
</P>
<P>
   A V Group spokesman has denied Zumpano represented them. Phone
records and an investigation by Stern's office, however, show that
Zumpano made at least some of the hundreds of phone calls from
NOVAA and other offices where Zumpano worked to the V Group's
Cleveland office phone and fax machine between December 1992 and
December 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Calls were also tracked from NOVAA to lobbyist Fabiano, and back
and forth from Zumpano's home phone to Paul Voinovich's unlisted
home phone.
</P>
<P>
   During that time period, calls also were placed from NOVAA to
the V Group's former lobbyist in Columbus, Stern found. Zumpano
began working at NOVAA in 1992 and for 10 years was a member of the
Jefferson County Board of Elections _ where other calls to the V
Group originated.
</P>
<P>
   How far the federal investigation goes is anyone's guess, but
three federal subpoenas served on the Ohio Environmental Protection
Agency in Columbus have sought volumes of memos and correspondence
from the governor's office on down, deep into the bureaucratic
bowels of the state's leading environmental regulatory agency.
Agents have hauled away two boxes of documents from state files.
</P>
<P>
   While the U.S. Attorney's Office in Cincinnati has steadfastly
refused to comment on the investigation, a source close to the case
said indictments are not likely to be returned from the grand jury
until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Elections commission complaint
</P>
<P>
   In August, the U.S. Attorney released grand jury testimony that
resulted in two complaints to the Ohio Elections Commission
involving Gov. Voinovich, his brother Paul, and officials from the
V Group and the governor's 1994 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   One complaint accuses the governor, his campaign treasurer
Vincent Panichi, Paul Voinovich, lobbyist Anthony Fabiano and the
campaign consulting firm Mamais &AMP; Associates of ``misrepresenting''
a $60,000 campaign expenditure in 1994. The other complaint accuses
Fabiano, his company, ECIC, Inc., the V Group, and V Group Vice
President Frank Fela of improperly using corporate funds for
partisan political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Nichols, president of the International Union of
Electrical Workers in Trumbull County, filed an additional
complaint Thursday alleging campaign finance reporting violations
based on the same transactions. Nichols' attorney is Donald
McTigue, who has represented the state Democratic Party in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   The $60,000 payment was allegedly used to reimburse Paul
Voinovich and Fabiano for payments made to longtime Voinovich
supporter Anthony Gallagher for work on the governor's campaign.
Corporations are not allowed to contribute to political campaigns,
so any campaign work while on the Fabiano &AMP; Associates payroll
would amount to an illegal corporate contribution.
</P>
<P>
   The money was reported by the campaign as an expenditure for
``voter program development'' to Mamais &AMP; Associates, which served
as a conduit for the cash. Panichi told the grand jury Gov.
Voinovich approved the arrangement during a meeting he attended
with Paul Voinovich.
</P>
<P>
   According to grand jury testimony by Fela, Fabiano hired
Gallagher after consulting with Paul Voinovich. Gallagher, a
longtime pipefitters union representative, had been appointed by
the governor in early 1994 to the Industrial Commission of Ohio,
but declined to take the post when his previously ``expunged''
criminal record came to light. Fela said Fabiano and Paul Voinovich
wanted to ``be helpful'' until Gallagher could find another job.
</P>
<P>
   Fabiano paid Gallagher's salary by reducing a $6,000 monthly
``retainer'' he'd been sending the V Group. The reason for the
retainer has yet to be publicly explained. V Group spokesman Tom
Andrzejewski declined to say why Fabiano _ then a lobbyist for WTI
_ needed an architectural and engineering firm on a retainer.
``That's a private business relationship,'' Andrzejewski said,
``and the V Group has a policy of not discussing private business
relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Fela told the grand jury that Paul Voinovich was
``furious'' when he learned his company's retainer had been reduced
by $30,000 during 1994 because of the payments to Gallagher.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Voinovich then asked his brother for reimbursement for the
payments to Gallagher, and suggested the payment be made through
Mamais &AMP; Associates, according to grand jury testimony by Panichi,
Voinovich's campaign treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   A probable cause hearing is scheduled for Dec. 10 in Columbus on
the election complaints but may be delayed by this week's complaint
by Nichols. The commission could act at the hearing, said director
Phil Richter, it could hand the case to a special investigator, or
it could hold more complete hearings at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   Maximum penalties for the governor include a $10,000 fine and
loss of state office. It's unlikely, however, that a state law
could be used to take away his U.S. Senate seat. The commission has
no authority to impose fines or penalties either, Richter said. The
case would have to be referred to a prosecutor and taken to court.
</P>
<P>
   Panichi refused to comment on the case. Calls to the V Group
were referred to spokesman Andrzejewski. Anthony Gallagher has
suffered a stroke, according to his wife, and is not available for
comment. Nick Mamais is deceased and Mamais &AMP; Associates is out of
business. Anthony Fabiano could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Voinovich's attorney, David Young, said the governor denies
the representation of facts given to the commission and expects to
be cleared.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, witnesses continue to appear before the grand jury in
Cincinnati and are being questioned by Assistant U.S. Attorney
Kathleen Brinkman, a source close to the proceedings said. No date
for concluding the investigation has been set.
</P>
<P>
   Northeast Ohio connections
</P>
<P>
   Bits and scraps left behind in the investigation's wake include
three detailed subpoenas served on the OEPA between August of last
year and May, suggestive snippets of heavily censored grand jury
testimonies from Gallagher, Panichi and others, a likewise edited
account of an FBI interview with V Group Vice President Fela and
two pages from a lengthy statement of facts compiled by IRS
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The subpoenas demand records that could show links among WTI's
incinerator in East Liverpool, a Steubenville area landfill, and a
laundry list of state governor's office and environmental
regulatory officials, Columbus lobbyists and V Group employees.
</P>
<P>
   The recurring theme of the subpoenas is NOVAA, the now- defunct
agency the state OEPA employed for 25 years to monitor air
pollution in Belmont, Carroll, Columbiana, Harrison, Jefferson and
Monroe counties.
</P>
<P>
   WTI's incinerator was one of the largest plants on NOVAA's
monitoring list. In addition, WTI entered into separate
arrangements with NOVAA for additional monitoring and studies.
</P>
<P>
   The plant, which has withstood lengthy and heated protests from
local residents, is owned by the Switzerland-based Von Roll Group.
It employs 184 people and ranks as the seventh-largest commercial
U.S. incinerator, consuming 60,000 tons of waste annually.
</P>
<P>
   WTI officials acknowledge their relations with NOVAA were _ at
least for a time _ antagonistic. They say they hired lobbyist
Fabiano in February 1994 as a consultant to work on ``improving
this relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The way NOVAA's former board chairman Petrola sees it, however,
executive director DeLuca took advantage of WTI's difficult public
position in the community, directing WTI to hire lobbyist Fabiano
for $27,000 a month. In addition, the company paid for additional
NOVAA-connected environmental studies that were not required by the
state, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how much WTI paid NOVAA for the additional
monitoring, but in a statement the company acknowledged paying more
than $100,000 for one study that was never completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (WTI) had so much public animosity, they needed a clean
slate,'' Petrola said. ``They paid a ton of money.'' According a
prepared statement by WTI, company officials hired ``a consultant
to manage downward politically toward better relations with a local
agency.'' As for a connection to Paul Voinovich: ``WTI never
attempted to 'go through Paul Voinovich' to curry favor with state
government,'' according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Results of a special state audit underscore Petrola's concerns
about NOVAA. In March of last year, state auditor Jim Petro found
more than $24,000 in funds were illegally collected by NOVAA's
DeLuca in unauthorized severance payments, unallowable travel and
lodging expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The audit also found NOVAA collected special fees directly from
local industries to conduct some monitoring tasks _ an arrangement
unknown to OEPA officials who approved NOVAA's $800,000 annual
state funding.
</P>
<P>
   Employees signed ``individual agreements'' with DeLuca to
perform the services, according to the audit. These fees padded
various NOVAA employees' regular paychecks by $54,000 in 1995 and
$33,723 the first half of 1997, the audit said. The audit also
found NOVAA executive director DeLuca made NOVAA employees work on
agency time to build and staff an entertainment complex he co-owns.
</P>
<P>
   WTI spokesman Raymond Wayne explained company officials approved
additional monitoring in an effort to appease local critics. ``To
paint it as if we were paying off a regulator is inappropriate,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Local critics, many living within sight of the facility, have
seized on the extra studies, saying they call into question the
independence of a regulator paid by the plant it is supposed to be
monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel there are still many questions that are unanswered,''
said Alonzo Spencer, one of the plant's most vociferous critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a conflict of interest that is very disturbing,'' said
Sandy Estell, who with her husband and five children lives on a
river bluff 800 feet from the incinerator.
</P>
<P>
   To date, residents say, the most serious incident occurred on a
March 1995 afternoon when a strong odor chased some locals from
their homes. WTI promised NOVAA it would prevent a recurrence.
</P>
<P>
   OEPA's contract with NOVAA expired in September 1997 and was not
renewed. OEPA staffers now have the monitoring job.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal reviews of the plant, including a General
Accounting Office report and an eight-volume U.S. EPA review, have
said the plant overall poses no significant risks to residents.
</P>
<P>
   WTI spokesman Wayne wouldn't comment about the investigation,
but he called WTI ``the most scrutinized hazardous waste treatment
plant in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Final Days
</P>
<P>
   Documents forwarded from the grand jury to the Ohio Elections
Commission indicate investigators are exploring possible
connections between Fabiano, the former WTI lobbyist, and the
governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   An Internal Revenue Service document says Mike Parkes, a WTI
spokesman, told Fabiano that then Voinovich Chief of Staff Paul
Mifsud helped the lobbyist get the WTI contract. Parkes could not
be reached.
</P>
<P>
   The WTI incinerator isn't the only northeast Ohio enterprise of
interest to federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury subpoena to the OEPA targets a landfill connected
to the Jefferson County Jail project. The landfill was needed for
demolition debris from the jail site. The V Group did the
architectural work for the project and eventually received the
construction management contract.
</P>
<P>
   The demolition landfill permit came during a period when OEPA
had declared a statewide moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   Grand jury subpoenas request documents from Ohio EPA Director
Donald R. Schregardus, another top OEPA official, Gerry Ioannides;
Gov. Voinovich, his executive assistant, Andy Futey; former chief
of staff Mifsud, and various other state officials, lobbyists,
consultants and contractors.
</P>
<P>
   After eight years as a popular governor, this clearly was not
the way George Voinovich wanted to spend his final days in the
statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Said Republican Chairman Bennett: ``I think the governor is very
disappointed that this all happened now.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico _ There is no sign of peace
between the government and the Zapatista rebels in the southern
state of Chiapas, and little reason to hope for a settlement
anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend some of the highest Zapatista commanders donned
their black masks and traditional Indian regalia to come out of
hiding and travel here for meetings with their sympathizers and
with mediators in peace talks. It was the first time they had left
their clandestine strongholds in two years and their first attempt
to move things forward with the mediators since talks collapsed in
late 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as the meetings began the Zapatistas fought with the
mediators, and the rebels and the government began accusing each
other of bad faith.
</P>
<P>
   An Indian commander in military fatigues who goes by the name of
Tacho complained that the 29-member Zapatista delegation had been
given only ``miserable little cots'' with no mattresses to sleep on
by the mediators, who were in charge of organizing logistics for
the event.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatistas said that the mediators, federal lawmakers drawn
from a range of political parties, had also failed to arrange
adequate security. The International Committee of the Red Cross was
in charge of setting up a security cordon around the meeting site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not allow our Indian peoples to be humiliated ever
again,'' Tacho said, calling the mediators racist.
</P>
<P>
   The offended mediators rejected the Zapatistas' charge but
rushed to find better accommodations for them. Top government
officials seized on the incident as a sign that the Zapatistas were
interested only in publicity, not peace.
</P>
<P>
   There were, in short, many new indications of the depth of the
impasse between the government and the peculiar, quasi-guerrilla
Indian organization in Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   The government says it wants peace but continues to harass
Zapatista villages, belittle their demands, underestimate the
sympathy they attract among Mexicans and turn a blind eye to
attacks on Zapatista sympathizers by government followers.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the Zapatista leaders announced their intention to
return to public view, the armed forces dispatched a platoon to
march through a key Zapatista village, making a show of contempt
for the rebel initiative.
</P>
<P>
   A hint of the ambiguity of the Zapatistas lies in their
appearance. Their leaders, mysterious and appealing figures to many
Mexicans, wear wide-brimmed straw hats topped with cheerfully
colored satin ribbons but conceal their faces behind forbidding
black ski masks.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatistas retain the trappings of a military rebel force.
Last week Subcommander Marcos, a non-Indian who is regarded as the
de facto leader of the Zapatista National Liberation Army, posed
for a photographer once again in full military garb with an AK-47
automatic rifle strapped across his chest.
</P>
<P>
   By law, as long as some form of peace process is under way, the
rebels are allowed to keep their weapons. But since they staged a
weeklong armed uprising in January 1994, the Zapatistas have
repeatedly declared their commitment to political, not military,
means.
</P>
<P>
   This year, as the rest of Mexico was deciding how to share
political power in a dozen relatively orderly state elections, the
Zapatistas staged a tactical withdrawal from the stage of public
opinion, where they have always been very effective. After a
massacre of their sympathizers in December 1997 and a series of
government attacks on Zapatista-run villages this year, Zapatista
leaders went silent, cutting off communications even with close
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings here are partly a recognition by the Zapatistas
that they took their silence too far. In a pensive interview last
week with the newspaper La Jornada, Marcos acknowledged that his
forces had been too quick to cut themselves off from potential
allies in political parties and other unarmed groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``When making political declarations one tends not to make
subtle distinctions,'' he admitted.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatistas gathered 2,500 of their most enthusiastic
followers from all over Mexico to chart a strategy to build
national support for their proposals for greater political
independence for Indian peoples. ``You are not alone!'' was the
favorite cheer from the floor at the inauguration of the talks
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not clear that the Zapatistas had come up with any
new approach during past months.
</P>
<P>
   The main sticking points are differences between the two sides
over accords on autonomy for Indian villages that government
negotiators signed in 1996 and later sought to revise. One irony is
that the positions are not that far apart and could probably be
resolved in serious talks.
</P>
<P>
   What exists in Chiapas cannot be called war because there is no
military combat. But there is no sign of what might be called
peace.

 &HT;    Era of the `Anti-Newt'
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANDEVILLE, La. _ His first job was cleaning up after elephants
in the New Orleans zoo; some people like to say he has come full
circle.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Livingston (R-La.), who was chosen Wednesday to succeed
U.S. Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) as speaker of the House, is not
flashy, but he says he will clean up the mess left by the November
elections. He promises no contracts with America and no Republican
revolution, just good management of the day-to-day business of the
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people want, demand and deserve good, solid,
conscientious, honest government dealing with the toughest problems
that face the country,'' Livingston said last Saturday at a
barbecue fund-raiser in his congressional district outside New
Orleans. More than 500 supporters paying $100 a couple stood in
line in the rain to shake hands with the man they call friendly,
down-to-earth and above all, honest.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, he is the anti-Newt. The 55-year-old Livingston,
who is 6-foot-5 with a booming voice to match, has the humble goal
of making the metaphorical trains run on time. He'll spend most of
his days in Washington, not on the road spreading the gospel of
conservatism as Gingrich has, and he vows to work long hours and
weekends doing what he does best _ good old-fashioned governing.
</P>
<P>
   After his selection as speaker by the Republicans Wednesday,
Livingston pledged to cooperate with Democrats. ``We Republicans
lose nothing by reaching out to the other side, to talk and listen
and work in tandem with those who may share some of our goals and
dreams,'' he said. He doesn't plan any major agenda changes, just a
radical change in management style.
</P>
<P>
   This much about Livingston is predictable, and comes as a relief
for many people who were tired of riding Gingrich's roller coaster
of inflammatory statements and controversy. Unlike Gingrich, who
became a reviled figure to Democrats and even to a good share of
Republicans, it is hard to find anyone, Democrat or Republican, who
doesn't like or at least accept Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   That appeal goes back to his earliest days as a politician, said
Melvin Bush, who has worked for Livingston since he became a
congressman 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a populist,'' he said. Livingtson's district used to
include several New Orleans housing projects, and Livingston
captured 78 percent of the black vote in his first election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once, he knocked on a woman's door and said, `Hi, I'm Bob
Livingston and I want to work for you,''' said Bush, who imitated
his boss' voice and drew himself up a little taller to tell his
story. ``The woman said, `Come on in, I've got some dishes in the
back and the bathroom's dirty.'''
</P>
<P>
   What struck Bush and other black people in the district was that
after Livingston won, he didn't forget them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went to the black churches to campaign, like many
politicians, but then he'd go back and thank them,'' Bush said.
``Nobody ever did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston has represented the 1st District here for two
decades, running uncontested in the last two elections and winning
81 percent of the vote in the 1994 race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Democrat and I think he's great,'' said Velma Pitre, who
was shopping in Livingston's district last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll get Democrats to buy into programs they would
have been opposed to,'' predicted Suzanne Villa of Mande-
</P>
<P>
   ville.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one Republican is wondering if the party will be
sorry Gingrich is gone once his antithesis takes the reins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Livingston has enormous shoes to fill,'' said former state
Sen. Ben Bagert of New Orleans. ``The Republicans won't even be
able to hang on to the House unless Bob Livingston demonstrates an
ability to clearly articulate a Republican vision for America. My
advice to Bob would be to get up every morning and after you say
your prayers read one of Newt's speeches. Good management is
important, but at the national level, the more important asset for
a leader is to be the ideologue who can articulate.''
</P>
<P>
   That `endearing goofiness'
</P>
<P>
   So if he's not Newt Gingrich, who is he?
</P>
<P>
   At the ``Bob-B-Q'' in Mandeville last Saturday, Livingston
towered over his constituents, shaking hands, remembering names and
hugging friends. There were banners everywhere that read,
``Livingston: Speaker.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Bonnie, stood by his side, smiling and patiently
answering questions from reporters who crowded around her.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Livingston recently went to lunch with Gingrich's wife,
Marianne, to learn what to expect as speaker's wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me what was good and what was bad,'' she said. ``She
said the unfair criticism was bad. But Bob comes in without being
the person who caused the other party to go out of office, so he'll
have fewer problems, hopefully.''
</P>
<P>
   When a cheerleading squad from a local high school performed a
special cheer for the presumptive speaker, Livingston cheered with
them, pumping his fist in the air and even dancing a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see that?'' Bush said. ``He's always been just like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Linlithgow said Livingston's straight-arrow, slighty
dorky image is no act. His media consultant, Ray Teddlie, calls it
an ``an endearing goofiness,'' and the New Orleans Times-Picayune
called him the ``standard-bearer of the fuddy-duddy wing of the
Republican Party.'' Conservative but ``fun,'' is how Bush describes
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a throwback to an earlier era,'' Teddlie said. ``He is
`Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.' Jimmy Stewart incarnate.''
</P>
<P>
   Teddlie says he may seem like a boy scout, but like a good
Louisianan, Livingston knows when to kick back and have fun. He
drinks beer with the best of them and hits the dance floor when the
Cajun fiddle starts up at his annual crawfish boil, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a big money-raiser, but it's a lot of fun,'' Teddlie
said.
</P>
<P>
   And he's no pushover _ he has a black belt in tae kwon do, and
is now famous for his temper and his occasional House floor
theatrics, such as playing the harmonica or wielding an alligator
skinning knife to illustrate how he would cut the budget.
</P>
<P>
   And he wasn't afraid to criticize President Clinton at the
Mandeville event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to challenge President Clinton to lead,'' he said.
``You know, too many times he's been able to sit back and let the
Republican Congress set the tone, and then he snatches it up. We
think it's about time he comes up with his initiatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston is a classic Republican, opposed to abortion, a
fiscal conservative who favors smaller government and reduced
taxes. As chairman of the Appropriations Committee, he cut $50
billion in government spending in his first year. To date, the
committee has cut 300 programs and frozen spending. His favorite
book is ``Atlas Shrugged'' by Ayn Rand, the libertarian classic
that extols the power of the individual.
</P>
<P>
   But Livingston fights proposed cuts in defense spending and is a
friend to business, especially the oil industry, which dominates
the Louisiana economy.
</P>
<P>
   His fund raiser last Saturday said a lot about his congressional
district. It was held in a rather sterile corporate office park and
was attended mostly by whites. The district, whose lines were
redrawn to exclude most of New Orleans, is more than 80 percent
white, suburban and increasingly Republican _ much like Gingrich's
Georgia district. It contains generations-old, blue-collar
neighborhoods and mushrooming subdivisions filled with people
fleeing New Orleans' inner city troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Founding father ancestor
</P>
<P>
   Livingston was born in Colorado but grew up in an old section of
New Orleans off St. Charles Avenue, moving to the suburbs only when
district lines were redrawn to exclude the city. On his father's
side, he comes from an aristocratic line of early Americans that
includes a signer of the Declaration of Independence and an
orchestrator of the Louisiana Purchase.
</P>
<P>
   But Livingston takes no pride in his lineage; the family fortune
was wiped out in the Depression, and his father, an alcoholic, left
his family to fend for themselves when Livingston was 7 years old.
He is now dead. His mother worked and managed to make enough money
to raise Livingston and his sister in what has been characterized
as a ``semi-blue collar'' style.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've become, I owe not to geneology, but to my mother,''
he told a Baton Rouge Advocate reporter in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   After a four-year stint in the Navy, Livingston worked his way
through school, selling Fuller brushes and working as a welder at
Avondale Shipyards, now Avondale Industries Inc. He received his
bachelor's and law degrees from Tulane, and went briefly into
private practice. But he disliked it and moved to the Orleans
Parish District Attorney's Office _ where he worked for Harry
Connick Sr. _ and later to the Louisiana Attorney General's Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the same as he is now,'' Connick said of his former
employee. ``Affable, aggressive, and he took his job seriously. He
could get a little red-faced once in a while, but outrage shows
interest in what you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's supporters like to portray him as a friend to the
common man. They point out that when he ran for Congress in 1976,
he had just $5,000 in the bank, all of which went into the
campaign. Two of his staffers, when asked which of the world-famous
New Orleans restaurants Livingston frequents, shrugged and couldn't
name one. They say he's more likely to eat a Big Mac in the car
than to sit down at Commander's Palace. A big treat is going to his
old neighborhood in New Orleans and eating an oyster po-boy _ fried
oysters sandwiched in crumbly french bread _ at Domilise's. ``I've
seen him pull a discount shirt out of a plastic bag in his
briefcase and put it on,'' Teddlie said.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston was elected to represent the 1st District in a
special election in 1977. He lost the original election by 3
percent, but his opponent then resigned in the midst of a voter
fraud scandal. Livingston has held the seat ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's main residence is outside Washington, but he keeps
a town house in Metairie, about 20 minutes from New Orleans. His
three sons live in Louisiana; his daughter, who is adopted, lives
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. David Vitter, a Republican in Livingston's district,
says the would-be speaker's background is one of the most appealing
things about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``His coming from a very modest background and getting ahead
through old-fashioned hard work and diligence says a lot about what
he brings to the job,'' he said. ``He is not a country club
Republican in any sense.''
</P>
<P>
   But Livingston isn't necessarily reveling in his lack of riches.
He almost resigned in February in part because he knew he could
double or triple his salary if he moved to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was Gingrich who talked him into staying. It was
also Gingrich who plucked him from obscurity four years ago, naming
him chairman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee. It is
unlikely that, before 1994, Livingston had any idea he would one
day be third in line to the president. John Maginnis, an expert in
Louisiana politics, said Livingston predicted in 1988 he would
never achieve more than being a low-profile U.S. representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `John, I've been here 10 years, and I have no power,
I'll probably serve 10 more years and still have no power,'''
Maginnis said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the last time Livingston aspired to a higher office,
he buckled under pressure and lost. In 1987, he and Edwin Edwards,
the flamboyant governor who was twice indicted on racketeering
charges in the 1980s, were in a close race for governor. But in a
statewide televised forum, Livingston went blank in the middle of a
sentence and said, ``I've lost my train of thought.'' He lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really stiffed up,'' Maginnis said. ``But in the end, it
was probably the best thing that could have happened to him.''
</P>
<P>
   A $32 million favor
</P>
<P>
   Livingston doesn't forget the people who keep returning him to
Washington. After all, it isn't just his pleasant demeanor that
keeps the voters happy; Livingston is generous to his home state.
He has sent millions of federal dollars and many jobs to his
district and to Louisiana as a whole. He is credited with the
creation of a massive urban drainage program of pump stations and
canals that has cost $100 million in two years. He secured federal
money to extend the streetcar line of Canal Street in New Orleans,
and he pushed for the construction of several new buildings for an
information technology center at the University of New Orleans. His
old employer, Avondale, currently has contracts totaling $2.1
billion in back-ordered work for the Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard,
including options for ships not yet ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Sam Caruso of Slidell recalls fondly a $32 million favor
Livingston did for him a few years back.
</P>
<P>
   NASA moved some computer operations from Slidell to Huntsville,
Ala., leaving a huge facility vacant. There is a law that prohibits
local governments from taking control of federally-owned property,
but Caruso wanted the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called Bob,'' he said. ``I said: `Bob, you can put a
particular law in place that overrides a general law. Write a law
that gives us ownership of that federal facility.' I gotta tell
you, he put it together and today, we own that facility. Is that a
good deal or what?''
</P>
<P>
   There's one more reason why Livingston is loved here; not only
is he the opposite of Gingrich, he is also the antithesis of the
stereotypical Louisiana politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has a worse image about politics than the state of
Louisiana,'' said Delton Charles, who is retired and lives in
Metairie. ``You wanna talk about bad politics, you start with
Louisiana. Livingston will bring new respect _ people will see that
not everyone in the state is a bum.

 &HT;    Senses come alive on streets of Morocco
 &HT;    By Tom Peeling
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FEZ, Morocco _ As our tour bus rumbled off the ferry and headed
for the Moroccan border, our Spanish guide had a warning for us:
</P>
<P>
   ``The switches on the walls, the lamps, the toilets ...'' He
paused a minute. ``In many cases, they're decorative.''
</P>
<P>
   Translated: They don't work.
</P>
<P>
   And he was right.
</P>
<P>
   We were midway through a 16-day bus tour when we left the
comforts of Spain and Portugal, crossed the Straits of Gibraltar
and headed into Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Two seacoast towns in northern Africa still belong to Spain, so
our bus with 38 tourists from the United States, Australia, Canada,
England and Syria had to drive a while to get to Morocco's border.
We waited as our tour guide, Adolfo, went into police headquarters.
He was gone a good 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   When Adolfo returned to the bus, a policeman came with him. It
was a little unnerving as the officer went down the aisle, checking
each person's passport and the form we had to fill out for each day
of our visit, noting where we were staying and where we would be
headed the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we were cleared to go, and a Moroccan national guide
joined our tour. He would stay with us for our six days in Meknes,
Rabat, Tangier, Casablanca and our first stop, Fez.
</P>
<P>
   My wife and I knew we were headed into a Third World country. We
had been to Venezuela, but that had not prepared us for what we
would see now.
</P>
<P>
   We drove south for five or six hours through winding mountain
roads. We saw our first camels and enjoyed the beautiful pink
oleanders blooming throughout the hills. We marveled at the nomads
living in tents in the fields, watching their flocks and washing
their clothes in the river and hanging them on the bushes to dry.
</P>
<P>
   The contrasts were remarkable. In one little village, we saw men
throwing wheat into the air to separate the chaff from the grain,
right next to an outdoor cafe where a crowd of men gathered around
a large-screen TV watching a World Cup soccer match. A satellite
dish adorned the roof.
</P>
<P>
   We arrived in Fez late in the evening, after a 14-hour day of
travel. As we entered our room, suitcases in hand, we flicked on
the light switch. Nothing. Our first run-in with ``decorative
fixtures.''
</P>
<P>
   There was one electrical outlet in the room, leaving us with a
choice of watching the television or recharging the video camera
batteries.
</P>
<P>
   We arose early the next morning for our tour of the Old Medina,
or market, with Mohammed, our national guide. As we left the hotel,
we were surrounded by young men selling trinkets _ metal plates,
small leather camels, change purses, fez hats and more. Every move
we made over the next six days would be followed closely by the
street vendors.
</P>
<P>
   We entered one of the gates into the Medina, staying close to
our guide. We wound our way over the cobblestone streets for the
next three hours. Stalls lined the huge market, where vendors sold
everything _ food, clothing, pots and pans, jewelry, live chickens.
</P>
<P>
   The narrow ``streets'' were just wide enough for about three
people to pass abreast. But with the merchandise spilling out onto
the pathway and donkeys carrying full loads, single file was
usually the best our group could do. We all feared losing our way;
the Medina has to be the world's largest maze.
</P>
<P>
   We saw two boys who had spilled a bucket of chickpeas on the
cobblestones picking them up and putting them back in the bucket to
be sold.
</P>
<P>
   The cobblestones were wet. We shouldn't have asked. Donkey
urine, we were told.
</P>
<P>
   Our senses came alive. The overwhelming smell of farm animals,
the arguing in French and Arabic, the unnerving sights of flies
crawling on the meat for sale out in the heat and goat heads, fur
and all, laying in rows on the counters.
</P>
<P>
   We had an unofficial guide for our market tour. A boy of about
10 named Omar would tell us to ``watch our steps'' as we went down
stairs, or ``to the left'' or ``to the right'' as we turned. Once
we had passed him, he'd run ahead to the next obstacle and warn us
again. It reminded me of the nomads herding their sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Omar did it all for tips. And he was so cute we just
wanted to take him home with us.
</P>
<P>
   In the center of the Medina is the Qarawiyin (Kar-a-wyn) mosque,
built in 857 (yes, 857, not 1857). Only the Muslim man from Syria
in our group was allowed in, but the rest of us could peek through
the entrances into an area that holds 2,000 worshipers. Walls and
floors were entirely covered with tiny, colorful tiles.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, we emerged on the other side of the Medina, and,
true to Cosmos Tour Co. form, there was Telex, our bus driver. It
was close to 100 degrees that day, so it was wonderful to fall back
into our air-conditioned motorcoach.
</P>
<P>
   We circled the city to get a good look at the wall that
surrounds it, harkening back to the days when neighboring villages
weren't quite so friendly. We passed the Muslim cemetery, outside
the city wall, where the graves all faced east, toward Mecca in
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   We had some free time that afternoon, so Mohammed arranged a
walking tour of the newer part of the city. Many cafes lined the
streets, with men sitting together at tables. In Arab tradition,
men and women did not socialize in the same places.
</P>
<P>
   Each store owner had a photo of King Hassan II hanging over the
checkout area. The king is much beloved in this social monarchy, as
is his predecessor, Mohammed V. In fact, the main street in every
town is named Avenue Mohammed V.
</P>
<P>
   On a bus tour, you see a lot, but you don't spend a lot of time
in each town. After two nights in Fez, we were off to the capital,
Rabat.
</P>
<P>
   We arrived in Rabat around noon and were thrilled to see the
American flag flying over the embassy there. We grabbed a salad for
lunch. We had been warned about eating uncooked vegetables, but it
was hot, and the cold tossed salad looked so good we couldn't
resist. We'd all pay for it a day or two later, when most of
tourists experienced some ``abdominal distress.''
</P>
<P>
   Our last day in Morocco was spent in Tangier, where we visited
the home of the late Malcolm Forbes (it's now a toy soldier
museum). The rear of the home overlooks the place where the
Atlantic and Mediterranean come together.
</P>
<P>
   We rode a camel and learned to hold on tight. You'd better, or
when it goes down on its front knees to let you off, you might find
the ground sooner than expected.
</P>
<P>
   We felt the least comfortable in Tangier than anywhere else on
the trip. First, a man approached us on the street and offered to
give us a ``private tour.'' We said no, but he continued to follow
us for several blocks. We later saw him sitting at the cafe across
the street, waiting for tourists to come out of our hotel.
</P>
<P>
   We ventured out alone very little here. Because we looked more
``Western'' than most folks, we always had the feeling we were
being watched.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, our hotel in Tangier had its ``decorative features''
as well. This time, it was the toilet. The front desk sent the
French maid up to fix it. She looked it over and announced it
``broke.'' End of conversation. But if we used our garbage can to
fill the tank with water, we could get it to flush.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, we left to meet our ferry back to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Our bus pulled up to the customs office, and we all got in line
to show our passports. When it was our turn, my wife and I handed
our passports and registration forms to two men in a glass booth.
One man looked at my form and noted to the other man that where it
said ``Occupation,'' I had written ``Journalist.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men conferred, then the first man asked me the name of
the television station where I worked. I told him I worked at a
newspaper. The two conferred again, as my wife and I got a little
nervous. Folks behind us in line were waiting, and wondering.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the first man asked the questions. What newspaper did I
work for?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palm Beach Post, West Palm Beach, Florida, U.S.A.,'' I
said. They talked again, wrote the name of the newspaper down and
finally told us to pass through.
</P>
<P>
   We breathed a sigh of relief, got on the ferry, and watched the
African coast fade into the distance.

<P>
   Don't eat anything that's not cooked and served hot, no matter
how tempting the salads may be. Only eat fruit that has been
peeled.

   CASABLANCA SIDEBAR
</P>
<P>
   Casablanca. The name brings to mind romance, intrigue, danger.
</P>
<P>
   But this wasn't Hollywood, and we didn't find Ilsa, Sam or
Rick's Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   What we found instead was that the little town portrayed in the
movies has 3 million residents today, with another 3 million people
living in the outskirts.
</P>
<P>
   Casablanca is the industrial and governmental center of
Mor-occo. The city, with its huge port, sits on the Atlantic coast
with beautiful beaches.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of the city has to be the Hassan II Mosque,
completed in the past few years. It is the largest mosque outside
of Mecca, our guide told us, holding up to 20,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Casa, as the natives call the city, is the most modern place in
Morocco. Western clothing predominates.
</P>
<P>
   We even broke down and ate at a McDonald's, where my wife,
Becky, had a chance to try out her somewhat rusty French. French is
much more predominant in Casablanca than in the rest of the
country, where Arabic is spoken most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   While beautiful, with pretty promenades and city parks,
Casablanca is really just another big city.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, Louie, but it wasn't the beginning of a beautiful
friendship.
</P>
<P>
   BARGAINING SIDEBAR
</P>
<P>
   I like to think of myself as something of a bargainer.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, if I knew there was any shot of Publix selling me
bananas for 19 cents a pound instead of 39 cents, I'd haggle with
the produce guy.
</P>
<P>
   Buying a car isn't a headache for me; it's a bargaining bonanza.
Antique shows? I'm in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a case of being cheap, although I do know all the $3.95
to $4.95 lunch places in town.
</P>
<P>
   But when I got to Morocco, I soon realized I was out of my
league.
</P>
<P>
   We'd read in the tour book that if you can buy things for 50
percent of the marked price, you're doing great. Don't expect more,
but if you can get more, take it.
</P>
<P>
   Our first experience with the Moroccan way of doing business was
at a restroom stop when we entered the country. A man with a
blanket spread on the ground had his own little flea market going.
He had pens, old coins, other trinkets, and watches and more
watches.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was hurrying to get back on the bus before it left. But
passing up a flea market, no matter how small, is difficult for me.
So much junk, so little time.
</P>
<P>
   I spotted a silver pocket watch with a locomotive, crescent moon
and star on the front. I had to have it. ``How much?'' I asked the
old man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six hundred dirhams,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Calculating quickly, I realized that was about $60.
</P>
<P>
   ``One hundred fifty dirhams,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   Since I knew not one word of Arabic, and his four words of
English weren't helping much, it was a limited conversation. After
calling out more numbers, we finally settled on 300 dirhams, or
$30. I tossed him the dirhams, grabbed the pocket watch and ran for
the bus as the door was closing.
</P>
<P>
   As I slid into my seat all smiles, I finally got to take a close
look at the watch. In tiny letters inside it said ``Hong Kong.''
Probably a $15 pocket watch at Kmart back home, I thought.
</P>
<P>
   First lesson learned. Inspect the merchandise first.
</P>
<P>
   Our second chance at spreading some money around this beautiful
country was in the Old Medina, or old market, in Fez. Our guide had
promised to take us to a carpet shop.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a very primitive, dirty exterior, the inside of the
store was gorgeous. Ceilings 25 feet high greeted us. Walls were
covered with beautifully colored tiles. And carpets, hanging or
standing in rolls, were everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   After a mass sales pitch to our group, we were individually
given the hard sell.
</P>
<P>
   My wife and I had decided in advance that we would bring a nice,
small carpet home for our new wood floors in our Florida room. With
the huge selection at this co-op, it seemed like the perfect place
to buy one.
</P>
<P>
   I called our Moroccan guide aside and asked him if bargaining
was appropriate here. I mean, this was a nice store, not some
roadside flea market.
</P>
<P>
   He assured us that we probably could get about 10 percent off
the price. Being stupid tourists, we believed him, and that's what
we ended up paying.
</P>
<P>
   Later, I found out we might have been able to do much better if
we'd tried. I didn't feel too badly, since I knew some poor
Moroccan woman had slaved 8 to 9 months to make this rug by hand.
</P>
<P>
   Second bargaining lesson: Don't believe what the national tour
guides tell you. It's worse than asking the real estate agent for
the other party how low they'll go.
</P>
<P>
   We had many more chances to bargain during our six days in
Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   I bought some small, hand-sewn leather camels for $2.50 each
from a street vendor. (I had to buy three to get him down to that
price, which was 60 percent less than he was asking.) He had chased
me for about four blocks after I had asked him the price.
</P>
<P>
   Third lesson: Don't show interest in an item if you don't intend
to buy it. Some store owners will chase you right out of the store
waving the merchandise at you and yelling prices.
</P>
<P>
   Our biggest surprise was in Casablanca, a large, modern city. We
went into a small department store, and there were Moroccans
bargaining for everything. It was the equivalent of going into
JCPenney and asking if they could do better on the gold earrings.
</P>
<P>
   I found that Moroccans have taken haggling to a new level. I was
in awe.
</P>
<P>
   While walking one day in the capital city of Rabat, we passed a
supermarket. We didn't have time to go inside, but I was sure there
were folks inside getting bananas for 19 cents a pound.

NEWLY CONFIDENT WHITE HOUSE SEEKS WAYS TO EXIT IMPEACHMENT
PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A senior White House official, surveying the events
of the past week, sighed in relief and quoted Winston Churchill on
his experience in the Boer War: ``Nothing in life is so
exhilarating as to be shot at without result.''
</P>
<P>
   Good fortune continued to shine on President Clinton last week.
Independent counsel Kenneth Starr spent 12 hours before the House
Judiciary Committee on Thursday and produced no new revelations of
presidential vice. Democrats on the committee said Starr's most
newsworthy statement was that he had found no evidence of
impeachable offenses in the dismissal of White House travel office
employees and the retrieval of FBI files.
</P>
<P>
   And on Friday, Samuel Dash, the independent counsel's ethics
adviser, resigned, saying that Starr had abused his authority by
appearing before the House panel to advocate the impeachment of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   The White House firmly believes that Clinton has dodged yet
another bullet. With new confidence, Clinton aides are calling for
a rapid end to the impeachment inquiry and to the Monica Lewinsky
investigation that spawned it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's wrap it up,'' said Paul Begala, a senior White House
political counselor. ``The people, the Congress and the vast bulk
of constitutional scholars all believe there are no impeachable
offenses here.''
</P>
<P>
   As the week ended, White House officials were counting votes and
trying to read minds on Capitol Hill, looking for a way to
short-circuit the impeachment process. Top White House aides opened
lines of communication to Republicans in the House, possibly as a
prelude to a negotiated way out of the impeachment mess.
</P>
<P>
   The optimists in the Clinton camp saw a chance to peel away two
or three Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee to vote
against articles of impeachment, bringing a quick end to the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   But even the pessimists at the White House were increasingly
hopeful of a rapid and favorable exit, believing that they had a
decent chance of defeating an impeachment resolution on the House
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's appearance before the Judiciary Committee was intended
by the Republicans to showcase the prosecutor's bill of particulars
against the president. Instead, the hearing laid bare the deep
partisanship of the committee and the charged political nature of
the impeachment inquiry itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people are going to remember from the hearing are the
Republican members _ and only the Republican members _ giving Ken
Starr a standing ovation at the end of his testimony,'' said a
senior White House adviser. ``The wheels are coming off their
wagon, meaning the conglomeration of the Office of Independent
Counsel and the GOP. What they have accomplished is to trade Newt
Gingrich for Ken Starr as the public face of the Republican
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   On another front, White House lawyers continued to work on
answers to a catalog of 81 questions put to Clinton relating to
Starr's impeachment report.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers have been working on the responses for two weeks, but do
not expect to submit them to the committee before Tuesday, after
Clinton returns from a six-day trip to Asia. The president must
approve the document before it is forwarded to the panel, a White
House aide said.
</P>
<P>
   But a lawyer working on the matter, who insisted on anonymity,
said the White House was not stonewalling the committee. Some of
the questions are ``tricky,'' he said, adding that ``there is no
strategy to push it over to January,'' when a new, more closely
divided Congress is seated.
</P>
<P>
   While the cards continue to fall the president's way, Clinton's
fate is still largely in the hands of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is looking to Rep. Bob Livingston, soon to be
speaker of the House, to signal his intentions. He said last week
that he hoped to have the matter resolved by the end of the year _
an intention also expressed by Rep. Henry Hyde, chairman of the
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Livingston said Congress was still awaiting resolution of a
new matter raised by Starr, the complaint of Kathleen Willey that
Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance near the Oval Office. The
Judiciary Committee voted early Friday to issue four subpoenas to
witnesses who may have information about the incident and about
allegations that Ms. Willey was persuaded to keep it quiet.
</P>
<P>
   With only three working weeks left on the congressional calendar
this year, leaders in Congress and the White House are looking to
quickly establish the outline of a deal to end the impeachment
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot depends on what happens over the next few days, whether
Republicans step up to the plate and seize the moment,'' a White
House official said. ``It's completely out of our control. We're
waiting for a signal from Livingston: Does he assert himself
overtly or behind the scenes to bring some closure to this thing?''
</P>
<P>
   So far there has been no direct contact between top White House
officials and Livingston, but such a meeting could occur as early
as this week, a White House adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   But even that would be just a beginning, a session to open a
line of communication rather than to engage in negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of conversations going on all over town,''
said a White House official involved in handling impeachment
matters. ``But we're still in a temperature-taking mode, not an
arm-twisting mode. It's a time of great flux and uncertainty.''

SECT DISAPPEARS, AWAITING THE MILLENNIUM
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo.)   (jw) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Denver did not disappear in an apocalyptic earthquake
on Oct. 10, as predicted by a Christian sect leader. But now he has
disappeared with about 75 followers and their children.
</P>
<P>
   Leading up to Denver's date with destiny, members of the sect,
Concerned Christians, sold their cars, furniture and houses. They
told relatives of vague plans to travel abroad, probably to Israel,
with their leader, Monte Kim Miller.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 of the missing followers were found this week in
Israel, said Brig. Gen. Hezi Leder, the police attache at the
Israeli Embassy in Washington, on Friday evening. The list of
located Americans did not include Miller, who has prophesied that
he will be killed in the streets of Jerusalem in December 1999,
setting off an apocalyptic end to the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned about people worried about the end of
the millennium coming to Israel and trying to do something,'' Leder
said. ``If there is any evidence that they intend to commit a
crime, we intend to prevent them from coming into Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Already about 100 American Christians, none of them related to
Miller's group, have moved this year to the Mount of Olives section
of Jerusalem to await the end of the millennium, said one expert on
the phenomenon, Brenda Brasher, a religion professor at Mount Union
College in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the Concerned Christians group, she said, ``I would
be very surprised if this is the only one that takes such an act _
dropping out, severing all ties and heading to Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, Miller, a charismatic 6-foot-5-inch former marketing
executive for Procter &AMP; Gamble, was known for speaking in what he
said was the voice of God.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I will have to let God answer that,' '' Bill
Honsberger, a Baptist pastor, recalled Friday of an encounter he
had here with Miller two years ago. ``He shifted his position in
his chair, contorted his face and opened his mouth _ and it was
`God.' He kept threatening us, making it clear that God is going to
kill us.
</P>
<P>
   ``One member was in the room and he became enraptured,''
continued Honsberger, who has warned Christian radio stations about
Miller's violent prophecies.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, Miller spoke out against cults in Denver
churches. But, more recently, he seemed to have adopted some of the
practices he once preached against. As his preachings became
increasingly apocalyptic, he mailed letters to Denver churches,
accusing them of ``Satanic'' preaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord's grace has been with the church for 2,000 years; his
judgments are ready to begin,'' Miller told a Denver television
station, KUSA-TV, two years ago. ``He died on the cross for our
sins. Now we're to go to our deaths as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller wants his followers to be in Jerusalem, because according
to his teachings, the world will end at the end of next year. Only
he and his followers will be saved in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Miller appeared to secure strong control of
his followers. His followers appeared to support him financially
after he sought bankruptcy protection a year ago, in the face of
$600,000 in debts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kim has such control over this group,'' said Honsberger, who
has talked to many concerned relatives of members. ``They telephone
and ask him: `Can we go to the movies tonight? Should I talk to my
mother? Should I wear the blue outfit or the green outfit?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Miller's abandoned home here, which had served as the
group's headquarters, are taken by an answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, when members were getting passports in
preparation for leaving the country, Miller arranged for three
brothers who are members to marry three single women in the group,
said Mark Roggeman, a Denver police officer who studies the group
when he is off duty.
</P>
<P>
   In the only known incident when the sect conduct escalated above
the level of death threats, John Weaver, a retired police officer,
recalls that a church member armed with a pistol banged on his door
three years ago, when his daughter, Nicolette, left the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a rifle, and when he tried to get in, I stuck it in his
face,'' said Weaver, who has sent his 16-year-old daughter out of
state to military school. ``They came back a few nights later and
tried to pry the front door open.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver's ex-wife, Jan, is believed to be Miller's right-hand
assistant. Referring to the mass suicide by 39 members of the
Heaven's Gate group last year, Weaver said he feared that the
Concerned Christians could take a similar turn, saying, ``The best
way to describe this is Heaven's Gate.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews on Friday, several other relatives of missing
followers declined to be identified by name, saying that they
feared retaliation against their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is getting cryptic messages about being near a body
of water, that they are having a good time, and that the phone
lines are bad,'' said one woman, who speculated that her relative
was in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Roggeman, the police officer, said about 20 family members had
received similarly vague messages in the last month. He speculated
that the messages were intended to reduce concern and to reduce
pressure for a worldwide manhunt.

GANGS A SOURCE OF VIOLENCE, NOT PROTECTION, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Colo., Fla.)   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A new Justice Department study challenges
conventional wisdom about gangs, saying that those who join gangs
for protection from neighborhood violence often suffer serious
brutality in the assaults that are part of their initiation rites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many youths are under the mistaken impression that they will
be safer by joining a gang, while this report shows the exact
opposite,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said in a statement. ``Our
challenge is to educate young people so they realize that staying
away from gangs is the safest course.''
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that gang members were more likely to
commit crimes involving drugs, auto theft and shootings than their
non-gang peers. Gang members are also more likely to possess
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids who join gangs for status or protection usually end up
getting in more trouble,'' said Irving Spergel, a professor at the
University of Chicago and head of the Gang Research and Technical
Assistance Group. ``Kids who manage to avoid gangs have found their
self-esteem elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, sponsored by two Justice Department offices, the
Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention and the
National Institute of Justice, examines criminal behavior of gang
members and of those susceptible to gang membership in Denver and
Aurora, Colo., and in Broward County, Fla. Those communities were
chosen for their diverse populations and emerging gang problems.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers discovered a pattern of gang involvement. The median
age at which youths began hanging out with gangs was 13; they
tended to join gangs at 14 and experienced their first arrest
within a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The single best predictor of kids avoiding or getting out of
gangs is finding legitimate employment,'' Spergel said.
</P>
<P>
   The report's author, C. Ronald Huff, said the study underscored
the need for effective programs to help youths resist gang
membership.

GERMAN BANK CLOSE TO BANKERS TRUST DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN and LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In what would be the biggest takeover of an American financial
institution by a foreign bank, Germany's biggest bank, Deutsche
Bank AG, is on the verge of signing an agreement to buy Bankers
Trust Corp., the eighth-largest American bank, according to
executives involved in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, for $7.5 billion to $8 billion, could be announced as
early as this week and its price could go higher as details are
negotiated, they said. The current price represents only a small
premium to the total value of Bankers Trust's shares in the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   The planned deal is another reminder of the scale and the reach
of some of the huge international mergers already witnessed this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations have shown an increasing willingness to merge
regardless of where they are based. Even so, such large deals are
never simple to carry out, especially when the corporation created
by a megamerger spans the globe.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, Deutsche Bank, a commercial banking powerhouse
that has already had difficulties with recent forays into the
investment banking world, will face an enormous challenge in making
the planned acquisition of Bankers Trust a success.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust, having survived a series of financial scandals
that tarnished its reputation and hurt its bottom line, has been
refashioning itself as investment banker to the world's smaller,
faster-growing companies. It has also carved out a niche
underwriting and trading high-yield debt, so-called junk bonds. But
Bankers Trust has lacked the heft needed to compete with powerful
Wall Street competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank has openly sought an acquisition in the United
States to make a breakthrough into investment banking. Its planned
acquisition of Bankers Trust will certainly raise Deutsche Bank's
visibility on Wall Street, but it does not immediately grant it a
commanding presence in the investment banking market. Bankers Trust
is not a leader in overall stock and bond underwriting, nor is it
in the top ranks of companies that provide advice on mergers and
acquisitions, activities that provide some of the biggest profits
on Wall Street.

   LOS ANGELES _ For most people, traffic tickets are as welcome as
dental work. But this is Hollywood, and Jeremiah Gerbracht and his
dog, Lady Harley, think of them as tickets to fame.
</P>
<P>
   In the three years since Gerbracht, 58, got the Siberian husky,
with eyes the color of ice, he has been ticketed five times for
riding his Harley-Davidson with the dog hunched on the gas tank.
</P>
<P>
   He has gone to court in the first three cases, championing his
right to ride with his dog aboard. Each time, he has won partly
because the language of the vehicle code, which prohibits unsafe
riding by people, does not apply to animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no law that prevents animals from riding
on a motorcycle,'' Gerbracht says. And, he insists, he has a civil
right to take the dog with him, because Harley is a hearing dog,
and Gerbracht has impaired hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But behind Gerbracht's quixotic court fight is the fact that
with each traffic citation and each quirky news account that
follows, he is writing his own ticket to membership in the small
but visible fraternity of eccentric icons in Los Angeles _ no small
feat in a city where everyone, it seems, is vying for attention.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood is dotted with billboards advertising the buxom
Angelyne, whose business is being famous for her fame. Harry Perry,
the roller-skating, electric-guitar-playing Sikh, is a fixture of
the Venice Beach boardwalk. And there is Dennis Woodruff, whose
self-publicized struggle to become an actor led him to arrange his
own surname atop his car in the fashion of the Hollywood sign,
W-O-O-D-R-U-F-F. To that list add Gerbracht and Lady Harley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that there's a kind of mentality out here that people
come out here to be stars, and to get noticed and to do their
thing,'' said Ajay Sahgal, a Los Angeles author whose novel
``Pool'' dealt with the perils of fame. ``Some of these people live
on the fringe, but they get noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerbracht moved west from Phoenix, N.Y., in 1966 and soon gained
recognition for having a dog, Jenny, that could climb trees. There
were near misses getting the dog on ``The Bionic Woman'' program
and ``The Tonight Show'' in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The lure of Hollywood brought him south to Los Angeles
permanently in 1977, and he built up a healthy packet of press
clippings about his dog. Jenny died in 1987, but Gerbracht was
drawn to Harley in 1995 by the feeling that she was the
reincarnation of his previous dog. They were soon going for rides
on the motorcycle together _ another thing Jenny enjoyed _ and
getting traffic tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The first two, under the code that prohibits people from riding
on something not designed for passengers and from interfering with
the driver, were thrown out because they did not apply to an
animal. Gerbracht was found not guilty last week on his third
ticket, for unsafe operation of a vehicle. He has not yet gone to
court on the others.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gerbracht's court battles have been well documented by the
media, thanks in part to his promotional efforts, and he sees his
story as an antidote to stories about war, famine and politics.
</P>
<P>
   All of which, true to Hollywood's essence, Gerbracht thinks
would make a good movie. Or better yet, three.
</P>
<P>
   The first, he says, would deal with Jenny's rise to fame for
climbing trees, and would end, after Jenny's death, with Gerbracht
meeting Lady Harley. In the second, tentatively titled ``Once Upon
a Ride,'' Harley strives for world fame on behalf of Jenny by
riding on motorcycles. In the third movie, ``Once Upon a Ride
Again!'' Harley and Gerbracht take off on a worldwide trip, their
fame and popularity growing as they ride, culminating with a hero's
welcome in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't it be wonderful,'' Gerbracht said, ``going into the
new millennium with stories like a new Benji, Lassie, Rin Tin Tin
type stories, rather than the heavy-duty garbage?''

WILLIAM FRENCH GITHENS, PIONEER OF NEWSREEL THEATERS, 92 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., N.J.)   (bl)  
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ William French Githens, a newsreel pioneer and
tennis-playing society figure, died Nov. 10 at a hospice near his
retirement home in Arlington, Va. He was 92 and is credited with
opening the world's first all-newsreel movie theater in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   In a democratic nation famous for the fluid movement between
classes, it is rare to catch a glimpse of the precise moment of
social elevation, which is why it is too bad that Githens did not
have his trusty Eyemo portable movie camera with him that evening
in 1927 when he presented himself at the royal penthouse suite of
the Savoy Plaza Hotel on Fifth Avenue in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Invited by a friend to join his family for dinner, Githens, then
21, had reason to feel self-conscious as he arrived at the hotel
wearing his new double-breasted dinner jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he had anything to be ashamed of. As the son of a New
York City fire captain, he had graduated from Columbia that year
with both a bachelor's degree and a master's in business
administration. In addition, he had an easy charm and had mastered
the society game of tennis so well that he had made the Columbia
team.
</P>
<P>
   He had also demonstrated a flair for business by acquiring an
early Eyemo in 1924. He used it to make films of Columbia football
games and then charged admission to show them, netting him $400 a
game, or about $4,000 in 1998 dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But for all his achievements, Githens was out of his social
league this December night. For his tennis friend, McClure Meredith
Howland, was the stepson of Ogden Hammond, a Civil War general's
son, who had made a fortune in banking, insurance and real estate
and was the U.S. ambassador to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Unaware that the evening would alter the course of his life,
Githens was greeted at the penthouse door by Howland and his
15-year-old stepbrother, Oggie Hammond, and led into the enormous
living room to meet Oggie's sisters, Mary and Millicent Hammond,
and their first cousin, Margaret Starr.
</P>
<P>
   If Githens had had his Eyemo tucked under his arm as he stood in
front of 17-year-old Millicent to be introduced, the resulting film
would have shown a series of jerky views of the room's elaborate
paneling, ceiling, far wall and carpeted floor as Githens tumbled
backward, the spinning camera perhaps catching a glimpse of the
impish grin on the face of young Oggie, who had knelt behind the
unsuspecting visitor's knees as Howland had given him a fateful
push.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Githens admitted that his first thought had been of
his new dinner jacket, but once he'd checked and found all buttons
in place, he got up laughing _ and secured his position in society.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like you,'' Millicent told him. ``You know how to laugh at
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the start of a friendship that would last for 65 years,
until Miss Hammond, by then long since known as Millicent Fenwick,
the redoubtable four-term congresswoman from New Jersey, died in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Githens apparently made an even more favorable impression on her
cousin, Peggy Starr. Within five years, they had married and begun
raising poodles in Bernardsville, N.J., where Githens served two
terms as mayor in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The evening paid immediate dividends. Hammond was so impressed
by the young man's maturity that he asked him to be his private
secretary in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to New York after a heady year abroad, Githens almost
immediately converted the 4-year-old Embassy Theater on Broadway
and 46th Street into what he was never shy about calling the
world's first all-newsreel, all-the-time movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   It opened on Nov. 2, 1929, catching a Depression wave that
helped turn the United States into a nation of news addicts. Within
a few years, as Githens was simultaneously working with Fox
Movietone News and later as managing editor of Pathe News, the
Embassy had expanded into a chain of 26 theaters stretching from
New York to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when a famous Peter Arno cartoon made ``going down to
the Trans-Lux to hiss Roosevelt'' an upper-crust mantra, Githens,
who had campaigned for Roosevelt in 1932, took precautions to
protect the president from such disrespect in Embassy theaters: He
ordered a picture of an American flag to be shown at the end of
every Roosevelt appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Githens, who eventually started and ran six corporations,
including film production companies, was in his element in the
1930s. Having learned to fly to indulge his fascination with aerial
photography, he eventually owned seven planes. and thought nothing
of popping over from New Jersey for a game of tennis on Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, he produced training films for the Navy,
but with the emergence of television after the war, his business
slid into bankruptcy. By the time his wife died in 1968, he had
been reduced to selling Rolls-Royces in Manhattan, but with such
charm that a widow named Sophe Delar, who stopped in to have her
1932 Rolls serviced, took him back to Croton-on-Hudson as her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   A few months after her death in 1986, he married Anita Githens,
the widow of an older brother, and moved to her home on Long
Island. She died in 1991, but the marriage continued to give
Githens, who had no children, the delicious pleasure of hearing his
nephew, John Lawrence Githens, a Manhattan translator, address him
as Uncle Stepfather.

   A Chinook will push temperatures to near-record levels across
the foothills and high plains to the east of the central Rockies on
Saturday as winds from the west warm on descent from lofty peaks.
Afternoon temperatures will soar above 70 degrees as far north as
Nebraska. The strongest winds will occur in eastern Colorado,
western Nebraska, and western Kansas, where speeds will average
20-40 mph. Gusts of 50 mph or more are possible in eastern Colorado
below narrow mountain passes. Blowing dust will limit visibility in
some areas.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures will soar 10-15 degrees above Saturday's readings
across the Ohio Valley and southern Great Lakes, but dry winds from
the southwest averaging 15-25 mph will likely lessen the feel of
the warmer air.
</P>
<P>
   Snow will fall in the northern Rockies from Idaho to western
Wyoming and northern Utah as a Pacific jet stream disturbance races
east. The brunt of the snow will fall during the first half of the
day. In the settling wake of the disturbance, a few showers will
form from western Washington to northwest California as abating but
still moist ocean winds persist. Generally light to moderate snows
will fall in the Cascades, the northern Sierra and Siskiyous.
Another potent storm system will approach the Pacific Northwest on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A deep chill will numb parts of the Middle Atlantic and
Southeast states early Sunday morning as strong, cold high pressure
drifts east across the region. Monday, the high will pump milder
air toward the Northeast, heralding an early week warm-up.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Capital Drought &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A severe drought persists in Washington, D.C., where, on Friday,
a paltry 0.07 inches of rain hardly settled the dust. Since July 1,
there have been only three days when 0.5 inches of rain or more
fell in the city. Moreover, only 4.75 inches of rain have been
measured since July 1. In the nearly 130 years of records, only
1930 rivals the current dry spell, with 5.29 inches of rain falling
from July through November. Assuming that the drought persists, the
city's all-time record dry spell for the latter six months of the
year, 6.79 inches of rain, which was also set in 1930, could be
broken.

RENO MOVES CLOSER TO FIRST DECISION ON FUND RAISING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Changes ``this week'' to ``last week'' in 5th graf. No other
changes.)  (lb) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno must decide by Tuesday
whether to seek an independent counsel to investigate Vice
President Al Gore, in the first of three decisions likely to
determine whether there will ever be an outside investigation of
Democratic fund raising in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's deliberations, which in the next two weeks will also turn
to the former White House deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes and
then to President Clinton, will sweep across a panorama of
political fund-raising practices.
</P>
<P>
   She has reviewed some of the same underlying facts for nearly
two years, each time refusing to refer the case to an outside
counsel. But Reno has yet to reach a conclusion on the actions of
Gore or the other officials, law-enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, however, the political stakes have unexpectedly
risen as the House impeachment and the Justice Department's
campaign-finance investigation show signs of overlapping.
</P>
<P>
   Republican investigators for the House Judiciary Committee
decided last week to move beyond the Monica Lewinsky matter and
include campaign finance among the issues they are tentatively
exploring as they look for a wider pattern of perjury, obstruction
of justice and abuse of power by the president.
</P>
<P>
   But the panel's interest might be short-lived. Lawmakers have
said they would vote on articles of impeachment early in December,
and Democrats are opposed to any expansion of the inquiry.
Nevertheless, the committee's inquiry has focused attention on
Reno's independent-counsel decisions.
</P>
<P>
   If she refuses to seek an independent counsel in each of the
three cases, as some law-enforcement officials believe to be
likely, it would almost certainly provoke a bitter outcry among
Republicans in Congress. One House committee investigating fund
raising has already voted to hold Reno in contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Even the possibility that the Judiciary Committee could advance
further onto Reno's campaign-finance turf could complicate the
attorney general's decision-making. Among other things, if the
scope of the impeachment inquiry widens far enough, it could
theoretically encompass an examination of Reno's own resistance to
appointing an independent prosecutor, although there is no evidence
that the White House played any role in Reno's past decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and the Judiciary panel are approaching
the issue with standards of evidence and goals that are very
different.
</P>
<P>
   The committee must decide whether Clinton committed impeachable
offenses. By comparison, Reno must decide, by a prosecutor's
standard, whether there are reasonable grounds to conclude that a
crime may have been committed in any of three discrete areas, each
focused on a different official.
</P>
<P>
   The deadlines, officials under scrutiny and issues being
examined by Reno are as follows:
</P>
<P>
   _ Nov. 24: Did Vice President Gore answer truthfully when he
told Justice Department investigators that he did not know that
contributions he solicited would be split between hard- and
soft-money accounts? A White House memorandum was unearthed several
months ago that indicated Gore attended a meeting on Nov. 21, 1995,
in which the splitting of contributions was discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said he did not realize that some of the large
contributions he solicited would be used not as soft money _
unregulated donations meant to finance general party activities
like voter-registration drives _ but as hard money. Hard money is
subject to regulation but could be spent on specific Clinton-Gore
re-election activities, like television advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nov. 30: Did Ickes answer truthfully in a deposition to Senate
investigators in 1997, when he said he did not recall taking any
action to intervene in a Teamsters strike at a Diamond Walnut
processing plant in Stockton, Calif.? Memorandums and testimony
showed that Ickes asked Mickey Kantor, then U.S. trade
representative, to telephone the company.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dec. 7: Did Clinton knowingly violate election laws when he
directed a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign by the
Democratic National Committee that might have improperly benefited
the Clinton-Gore campaign? Reno opened the inquiry after Federal
Election Commission field auditors questioned the legality of the
ad campaign, saying the commercials contained an electioneering
message, but should have stuck to generic party themes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials said that Reno's aides had engaged in
a spirited debate in the case of Gore after FBI interviews with
other officials in the November 1995 meeting produced contradictory
recollections. Some recalled a discussion of how contributions
would be split. Others did not.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee's interest in possible campaign-finance
abuses had been rumored for weeks. But on Thursday, David
Schippers, chief Republican counsel for the House committee's
impeachment inquiry, asked the Justice Department to turn over
copies of a confidential report written in July by Charles La Bella
as he was leaving as Reno's top campaign-finance prosecutor, along
with a report written last year by Director Louis Freeh of the FBI.
The reports had been prepared for Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Both reports directly challenged the conventional thinking at
the Justice Department, which held that Reno had no legal basis
under the independent-counsel statute to refer the political
fund-raising case to an outside prosecutor, because federal
election laws were too porous to hold top officials criminally
liable.
</P>
<P>
   The reports have been previously sought by Republicans in
Congress. Only a few lawmakers have seen them, and they saw only
the heavily edited versions. Reno's refusal to release the reports
to the House government Reform and Oversight Committee, which has
been looking into 1996 campaign fund-raising practices, resulted in
a contempt citation. The full texts of the Freeh and La Bella
reports, which are based on grand jury material, remain secret.
</P>
<P>
   Still, their main conclusions are known, including the overall
findings that the Democrats engaged in questionable activities in
many areas, that there was sufficient evidence for an independent
counsel and that only an outside prosecutor could credibly sort
through the complex body of accumulated evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the Judiciary panel may have difficulty digesting
the reports, because they were written to persuade Reno to seek an
independent prosecutor. Although La Bella and Freeh suggested that
Clinton operated at the center of a swirl of possible illegality,
neither directly addressed whether Clinton committed a potentially
impeachable offense.

   While the Asian crisis has already helped to lower energy costs,
the report offers by far the strongest evidence that the effects
will be deep and long-lasting.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, continued low energy prices are likely to
limit inflation, economists say. Weak Asian demand and heavy global
production also reduce the nation's vulnerability to any sudden
disruption of oil imports, which account for about half of U.S.
demand.
</P>
<P>
   But the low oil and gasoline prices also hamper the fight
against global warming. With oil at $13 or $15 a barrel, there are
few economic incentives for saving energy or using renewable energy
sources to reduce pollution that is blamed for global warming.
</P>
<P>
   The oil glut has also resulted from falling production costs and
the opening of new regions. The Energy Department expects higher
production from the Caspian Sea, the North Sea and the waters off
West Africa, as well as from Mexico, Colombia and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   While some oil companies are trimming their investments, many
are too far along on projects to turn back, said Jay Hakes, chief
of the department's Energy Information Administration, which issued
the report. ``You can't just turn the spigot off on a well that's
already producing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-cent-a-gallon savings in the year 2000 are from the
prices forecast if there had been no Asian crisis. Analysts at the
Energy Department and the oil companies doubt that oil prices will
necessarily remain at the present levels of less than $13 a barrel.
The partial resumption of Iraqi output, to pay for food, has
recently forced prices down, leaving unleaded regular gasoline at
less than $1 a gallon throughout much of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department, relying on economic forecasts by
DRI/McGraw Hill, sees Asia recovering so slowly that the average
oil price in the year 2000, adjusted for inflation, will still be
less than $14 a barrel. That price is about $5.50 a barrel less
than the $19.50 the department predicted last year, before the
scale of Asia's problems became evident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we were sort of seeing this like Mexico,'' said
Hakes, referring to that country's crisis four years ago. ``Where
there were economic problems, they bounced back pretty quickly.
This year we are seeing it as more sustained.''
</P>
<P>
   He cautions that it is unclear how quickly Asia will recapture
foreign investment. But even if energy demand there soars once
again, he says, global production can keep up. Not until about 2007
does his agency see oil prices returning to about where they would
have been apart from Asia's woes.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Stanislaw, president of Cambridge Energy Research
Associates, agreed that Asia's situation had reshaped the oil
market. ``The upward moving balloon of demand has been pierced by
the Asian crisis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oil companies, already trying to cut their staffs and economize,
have been pessimistic about prices for the next few years. Mark
Moody-Stuart, chairman of Royal Dutch/Shell, the world's largest
oil company, recently predicted prices of $12 to $16 a barrel over
the next two to three years.
</P>
<P>
   While oil producers like Mexico and Russia might suffer, low oil
prices are a boon for the United States, reducing not only
inflation but also the trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Continued low prices and rising consumption of fossil fuels,
including coal, will raise carbon emissions in about the year 2010
by 33 percent over the 1990 level, the agency predicts. To comply
with the Kyoto agreement to slow global warming, the United States
has pledged to reduce emissions over this period by 10 percent from
the 1990 level.
</P>
<P>
   Foes of the accord, which the administration signed earlier this
month but has not submitted to the Senate, have already cited the
agency's forecasts as evidence that compliance would be
prohibitively expensive. Administration officials say that the
United States, by paying other countries to reduce emissions and
encouraging technological progress, can reduce emissions much more
cheaply than the agency expects.

CLINTON SAYS HE SUFFERS PRIVATELY OVER LEWINSKY AFFAIR
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ In his most extensive remarks in weeks
about the scandal shadowing his presidency, President Clinton said
with a sad smile Saturday that he is still suffering privately over
his affair with Monica Lewinsky, but that his political punishment
was strictly up to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, this long ago ceased to be a political issue or a
legal issue and became a personal one,'' Clinton said. ``And every
day I do my best to put it right, personally.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke in answer to a question about whether Congress should
punish his behavior, during an appearance before reporters with
South Korean President Kim Dae Jung.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton smiled at first and suggested that he felt plenty
punished already. ``There has been a lot of suffering,'' he said.
``That is different from punishment, although it's hard to see the
difference sometimes as you're going through it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the smile faded and Clinton began to stare down toward the
white carpet as he said that it was ``not appropriate at this
time'' for him to express an opinion on how Congress should act.
The House Judiciary Committee opened impeachment hearings last week
into charges that Clinton committed perjury and obstructed justice
in hiding his affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trust the American people,'' the president said, ``and I
hope Congress will do the right thing in a nonpolitical way, if you
will, to get beyond the partisanship and go on.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House has argued that Clinton should not be impeached
for the offenses spelled out in a report to Congress by independent
counsel Kenneth Starr. Joe Lockhart, Clinton's spokesman, said that
the president interpreted the question Saturday to refer not to
impeachment but to some intermediate measure, such as censure.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said that while it was proper for the White House to
resist impeachment, it would be wrong for it ``to be in a position
of trying to prescribe'' a punishment short of that. White House
aides are anxious about seeming overconfident or offending members
of Congress by publicly suggesting that they should short-circuit
the impeachment process and offer a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats and moderate Republicans have floated the notion
of censure, but Lockhart said, ``I don't believe there is anything
at this point that is specific or concrete that has been brought to
our attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not bristle at Saturday's question, which he fielded
in a formal appearance in the Blue House, site of the Korean
president's office and residence. Standing to Clinton's left, Kim,
for decades a dissident campaigning for democracy here, remained
impassive.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has seemed increasingly confident recently about his
political position. On Friday night in Tokyo, he practically sought
out reporters to assure them he was paying little attention to the
hearings back in Washington. ``I've been here working on these
economic and security issues,'' he said. On a five-day trip to
Japan, Korea and Guam, Clinton is scheduled to return to Washington
on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Clinton noted for the first time that Starr had
testified to Congress last week that he had not found any
impeachable offenses in his investigations of the Whitewater real
estate deal, the dismissal of the staff of the White House travel
office or in the administration's improper gathering of hundreds of
FBI files on former Republican officials. Clinton called that
development a ``long-awaited acknowledgment.''

EDITORIAL: HENRY HYDE'S CONFUSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Nov. 22:
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Rep. Henry Hyde, the House Judiciary Committee
chairman, to subpoena additional witnesses for reasons he could not
explain outside executive session is a singularly bad idea for a
very specific reason. It sends the Judiciary Committee hurtling
down paths already meticulously explored by Kenneth Starr when Hyde
and the committee's Republican majority ought to be searching for
an exit strategy that would serve two valuable public needs.
</P>
<P>
   One is to allow Congress to move on to other business. The other
and more immediately important need is for Congress to find a way
to write into the historic record a condemnation of President
Clinton for failing in his constitutional duty to uphold the rule
of law.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of moving in an orderly way toward that goal, the
Republican leadership, and to some degree all of political
Washington, are dashing around blindly. The leaders cannot seem to
absorb the week's main political development. Clinton, barring the
emergence of dramatic new evidence, has won the political battle
over impeachment. Having heard Starr's evidence presented in its
most damning form, the American people do not want Clinton removed
from office, and the Republicans cannot muster the votes to
accomplish it.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's testimony and the assault on his tactics by David
Kendall, the president's lawyer, and others left the public and
congressional majorities where they started _ in favor of censuring
but not removing Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde continues to look like a man riding a bicycle with welded
handlebars. Does he really think he is going to find evidence that
will change that consensus by calling Kathleen Willey's lawyer,
Daniel Gecker, or Clinton's lawyer in the Paula Jones case, Robert
Bennett? These subpoenas represent a reckless assault on
attorney-client privilege for no apparent gain. Starr, whatever his
faults, did not seem to leave much room for new discoveries on the
sex-and-lies front.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the fact that Clinton lied in sworn and unsworn
situations to family, friends, the American people, the courts, his
staff and perhaps his own lawyer has been firmly established. If
the committee wants additional testimony on potentially impeachable
issues, it could more productively spend its time on allegations
like subornation of perjury or obstruction of justice and hear from
direct witnesses like Monica Lewinsky, Betty Currie and Vernon
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The most apparent need right now, though, is not for more
testimony but for focused leadership. Hyde's current direction
could lead to a successful vote in committee to pass articles of
impeachment and send them to the House. Impeachment would then fail
in the House, leading to the possibility that Clinton could escape
without official punishment. That is a totally unacceptable
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid it, Republican and Democratic leaders need to craft a
stinging censure for presidential misconduct that can be passed by
the Judiciary Committee or, failing that, offered as a substitute
measure on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   There are, admittedly, great pressures and enticing issues
pulling Washington away from the main business of finding an exit
strategy that gives Clinton the maximum punishment consistent with
political reality. Many of those issues are undeniably important.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Starr's tactics, as highlighted by Kendall's
critique and Sam Dash's oddly timed resignation, have to be fully
explored. Both Congress and the Justice Department have to come to
grips with Starr's disturbing hint that he might still want to
bring indictments after Congress has finished with Clinton. Both
bodies need to discover why Starr delayed informing the public of
his findings on Whitewater, Travelgate and Filegate.
</P>
<P>
   The Independent Counsel Act, while seemingly doomed by public
aversion to Starr, still deserves serious congressional debate when
it comes up for renewal next year.
</P>
<P>
   But the overriding immediate need is for Hyde and the Judiciary
Committee to start crafting a censure resolution before the start
of a political skirmish that could allow Clinton to slip past the
condemnation that he so richly deserves and that history demands.

FOR LETTERMAN STALKER, MENTAL ILLNESS WAS FAMILY SCAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Conn., Ill., Fla., Wis., N.J.)   (bl)  
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although she spent much of her time in the thrall of delusions,
Margaret Mary Ray wrote her last missive to her mother in what
seemed to be a moment of clarity.
</P>
<P>
   She mentioned her love for her children, wrested so many years
earlier from her care. She said she had tried, in her way, to be
good to them. And she gave vent to her exhaustion and
disillusionment, hinting that she understood how untenable her
existence had become.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all traveled out,'' Ms. Ray, 46, said in the letter, which
was written before her death Oct. 5, but reached her mother,
Loretta Duvall in Greenwich, Conn., when it was too late. ``I chose
a painless and instantaneous way to end my life in the valley I
loved.''
</P>
<P>
   That valley was in a remote area of Colorado, and that way was
to kneel before a 105-car coal train. Law-enforcement authorities
said that her end was indeed instantaneous. But family members and
friends said that the pain that preceded it was immeasurable.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, Ms. Ray drew national attention for
behavior so bizarre and audacious it was often portrayed as
comical. Gripped by the fantasy that she was romantically involved
with comedian David Letterman, she repeatedly broke into his home
in New Canaan, Conn., camped out on his tennis court and once stole
his Porsche.
</P>
<P>
   Her exploits became a staple of supermarket tabloids, a running
gag of sorts. Even Letterman turned them into a punch line, kidding
about her on his late night television talk show.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the headlines and jokes was a life almost
unimaginably sad, a harrowing portrait of the devastation that
mental illness can wreak not just on an individual but on an entire
family.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ray, one of four siblings, was the third to become ill and
the third to commit suicide. Her older brother drove a car at full
speed into a tree when he was 22. Her younger brother lay down in a
garage filling with carbon monoxide when he was 21.
</P>
<P>
   Although the medical records from Ms. Ray's various
court-ordered psychiatric evaluations are confidential, her mother,
Ms. Duvall, said that Ms. Ray suffered from schizophrenia, a brain
disorder believed by many psychiatrists to have a strong genetic
component.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Duvall said schizophrenia also plagued her children's
father, who died of a heart attack two decades ago, and the
couple's two dead sons. She said that if she knew when she started
her family what she knows now, she is not sure she would have
bothered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's foolish to rear all of these kids and have them be so
healthy and bright and have something eat away at their heads,''
said Ms. Duvall, 70, who lives in the Greenwich apartment of her
one surviving child, a 45-year-old businessman named Tom Ray.
``We're the only two left in this family, and it's
unconscionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Ms. Duvall added, ``My family has paid dues, and I'm not
sure what we did wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Ray said that throughout his years as an undergraduate at an
Ivy League university and his early adulthood, he feared that the
disease he watched destroy his brothers and sister would claim him
as well.
</P>
<P>
   He would worry that he had begun to hear nonexistent voices, a
telltale sign of schizophrenia, only to realize that a radio was
playing in a nearby room. ``I'm kind of the oddball of the
family,'' he said. ``The genetic lot missed me.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one of Ms. Ray's five children grappled with a similar
dread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I look so much like her, I've always been treated like
I'm going to be crazy, too,'' Anna-Lisa Johanson, a 22-year-old law
student in Washington, D.C., said of her mother. Ms. Johanson, who
was recently married, said she was not sure she would ever have
children, in part because she worried about their genetic
inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   She said that while she often tried in the past to conceal her
identity as the daughter of the woman who stalked David Letterman,
and once sought a restraining order against her mother, she refuses
to feel ashamed any longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm not embarrassed of who my mother was,'' she
said. ``I'm embarrassed of the society I live in. She was a sick
woman, and people made it a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Schizophrenia, which can give rise to visual and auditory
hallucinations, severe mood swings and incoherent behavior, is
believed to afflict 1 percent of adults and usually manifests
itself in men by their late teens or early 20s and women by their
mid-20s.
</P>
<P>
   Although doctors have yet to pinpoint its cause, and have
weighed such possibilities as abnormal prenatal development, viral
infection and environmental influences, much of their research in
recent years has focused on hereditary factors. ``It's clearly a
familial illness, and it appears to involve abnormal genes,'' said
Dr. Jack Gorman, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   Gorman said that an estimated 10 percent of people with
schizophrenia commit suicide, often motivated less by their
delusions than by the despair they feel in lucid moments.
Psychiatrists said the higher incidence of suicide in Ms. Ray's
family might be explained by the fact that people with loved ones
who commit suicide are more likely to see it as an option for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Schizophrenia can frequently be managed with drugs, but getting
people with the illness to stay on their medication can be
difficult. That was certainly true of Ms. Ray.
</P>
<P>
   Her relatives said that Ms. Ray did not like the side effects of
some drugs, which caused lethargy or weight gain. She often
convinced herself that there was nothing wrong with her and that
there was no need to take the medication. In addition, she missed
the grandiose self-image that came with her delusions, her mother
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made her feel important,'' Ms. Duvall said. ``She enjoyed
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Letterman said that in between Ms. Ray's uninvited visits to his
house over the years she sent him many letters, and it was obvious
from each whether she was taking her drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she was on them,'' he said in a recent telephone
interview, ``it was like hearing from your aunt. When she was off
them, it was like hearing from your aunt on Neptune.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Letterman said that if he occasionally joked about Ms. Ray's
behavior, it was only because he jokes about every public aspect of
his life. He noted that he never mentioned her name on the air, and
said that he had great compassion for her, often declining to press
criminal charges against her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't comfortable with the humanity of that,'' he said,
noting that most of her appearances at his house were more odd than
alarming, such as the time she convinced painters that she was his
housekeeper and cadged a ride into town for food.
</P>
<P>
   Only once, he said, did he feel threatened; that was when he and
a girlfriend looked up from bed one Sunday night and saw Ms. Ray
watching from the hallway. She immediately ran away, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ray often seemed to be running away, although it was seldom
clear why.
</P>
<P>
   She grew up in a middle-class family in Grayslake, Ill., about
45 miles northwest of Chicago. Her father, George Ray, worked on
the machinery maintenance staff at a factory; her mother, Loretta,
was a nurse. Margaret Ray, nicknamed Peggy, was the second oldest
of four children all born within five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the most wonderful, beautiful, all-American girl,''
recalled Clare Avery, a neighbor in Grayslake, who frequently hired
her as a baby sitter. ``Every mother around that lake would say,
`Don't you wish? Don't you wish you had a daughter like Peggy
Ray?'''
</P>
<P>
   The Ray home, however, was not entirely happy. Relatives said
that George Ray had been treated for schizophrenia before his
marriage, and while he maintained a job and a semblance of
normality, he drank heavily, possibly as a means of
self-medication.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Ray, the couple's oldest child, was the first to become
ill, around the time he was 20. Although he received treatment, he
hated the debilitating effect the medication had on him and did not
always take it, his relatives said.
</P>
<P>
   After Billy Ray's suicide in 1974, Tom Ray and his younger
brother, David, promised each other that they would never do that,
no matter what happened. But after David fell ill, he took the same
way out in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Tom Ray said, his family had learned enough about
schizophrenia to suspect that they were victims of something more
than happenstance. Even so, he said, his sister's impulsive
behavior and itinerant life initially seemed innocuous.
</P>
<P>
   She dropped out of a nursing program at Marquette University in
Milwaukee, married young and roamed the Midwest with her husband,
Gary Johanson. The couple had four children in rapid succession,
eventually settling near Grand Junction, Colo., where Johanson, a
carpenter, and several of the children still live.
</P>
<P>
   Johanson, who was divorced from Ms. Ray in the mid-1980s, did
not respond to a telephone message left with his second wife. She
said he does not like discussing his first marriage.
</P>
<P>
   It was a turbulent union, roiled by Ms. Ray's erratic behavior
and sudden jaunts across the country in borrowed cars with her four
young children. When they all arrived, in the summer of 1983, at a
loft in Manhattan where Tom Ray was living, he saw for the first
time how ill his sister, then 31, had become.
</P>
<P>
   She would wear three layers of clothing on a warm day and
prattle in sentences and syntax that made no sense. She would go
into the kitchen to fry hamburgers for the family's dinner and come
back with one enormous, under-cooked patty. Asked why, she simply
shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   Anna-Lisa Johanson, Ms. Ray's second oldest child, remembered
that whenever she was out walking with her mother, people stared at
them ``with this mix of pity and fear.'' Even as a 7-year-old, Ms.
Johanson said, she knew the reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a running commentary on the world that was very
inappropriate and a few decibels too loud,'' Ms. Johanson said of
her mother.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Ray's condition deteriorated, Johanson took custody of
the children. But Ms. Ray refused relatives' attempts to get her
into treatment, often bolting and disappearing for months as soon
as they made the suggestion. She hitchhiked back and forth across
the country, sometimes living in shanties without running water.
She had a fifth child; friends and relatives did not even know who
the father was.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was with her in Letterman's Porsche, stolen from his
home, when she was arrested outside the Lincoln Tunnel in New
Jersey in May 1988, the first time her obsession with Letterman was
publicly revealed. She told a toll collector that she was his wife
and that the child, Alex, just 3, was their son.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Ms. Duvall had divorced her husband, begun using her
maiden name and moved to Greenwich. She obtained custody of Alex,
caring for him with Tom Ray's help. Her daughter, meanwhile,
plunged further into her fantasies, on several occasions returning
to Letterman's house only days after being released from jail for
her last visit.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Ms. Ray was found competent to stand trial on
trespassing or burglary charges, sometimes not. She served her time
alternately in prisons and psychiatric hospitals. With medication
she would get better and be released, then she would stop taking it
and get worse.
</P>
<P>
   It was a vicious cycle that Ms. Duvall and Ray said they were
powerless to break. They could not commit Ms. Ray to an institution
or compel her to get treatment, they said, unless she was proved to
be a physical danger to herself or others.
</P>
<P>
   The damage Ms. Ray was doing was less immediate than that.
</P>
<P>
   Anna-Lisa Johanson said that on her 16th birthday, she got a
long-distance call from her mother during which Ms. Ray
incoherently accused her of being a tramp.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, Ms. Johanson said, she looked in the
mirror and made a private resolve. ``I decided to prove to the
world that I was not at all like my mother,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She got straight A's in high school, then maintained a perfect
grade-point average at the University of Colorado at Boulder.
Scared that her mother would show up and mortify her, she gave her
dormitory advisers a photograph of Ms. Ray and told them to notify
the police if they ever spotted her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most painful thing I've ever done,'' Ms. Johanson
said. ``But I knew it was the only way I could ever make myself a
success.'' She added, ``I've always loved my mother, but I hated
the woman who broke into David Letterman's house.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends said that Ms. Ray occasionally had insights into how
much she had hurt her children. During a recent stint in jail in
Florida, where she was convicted of stalking a new target, retired
astronaut F. Story Musgrave, she told a fellow inmate, Terry
Ellingson, that she wanted to do something that would make her kids
just a little proud.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ellingson said in a recent telephone interview that Ms. Ray
was on medication then, but that she did not continue treatment
after she was released in August and went to live briefly with Ms.
Ellingson, who was already out of jail. At the hearing that freed
Ms. Ray, a judge openly lamented the absence of any legal mechanism
to make sure she received medical help.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, Ms. Ray was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Johanson said that most of her siblings are healthy and
well-adjusted, but refused to be more specific, citing privacy
concerns. Ms. Duvall said that Alex Ray, now 14, is finally
flourishing after years of being taunted by peers who learned his
mother's identity.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ray mentioned him in that last letter, suggesting that the
greatest kindness she could show him was not to remind him of who
she was. ``I have no final words to Alex,'' she wrote. ``I think I
will let him just be distant in his mind to me.''

EDITORIAL: PROTECTION FOR ABORTION CLINICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Nov. 22:
</P>
<P>
   New York Gov. George Pataki took an important stand by proposing
new state legislation to protect women and doctors against violence
at abortion clinics. The Democratic-controlled state Assembly has
passed similar legislation every year since 1993, but it has
repeatedly died in the Republican-controlled Senate. The governor
has voiced support for such legislation in the past. Now he must
demand that the Senate take up and approve this measure.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's proposed bill will be patterned on the 1994 federal law
that makes it a crime to block access to medical facilities. It
will provide penalties of up to four years in prison for anyone who
``intentionally injures, intimidates or interferes with'' anyone
entering a clinic. It will also allow private individuals and local
district attorneys to bring civil lawsuits for damages against
those who unlawfully obstruct clinic access.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the governor will create a task force of law
enforcement officials, clinic administrators and advocacy groups to
coordinate efforts to ensure greater safety.
</P>
<P>
   The murder of Dr. Barnett Slepian, who had been threatened and
harassed at the clinic in Buffalo where he performed abortions
before he was shot in his home, might not have been prevented by a
new law. But the battle against anti-abortion extremists must take
place on several fronts. Political condemnation of violence is just
as important as creating new legal penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Some might say Pataki's move is intended to burnish his
credentials as a moderate as he positions himself for a possible
national campaign. But those urges show that he is sensitive to the
importance of the abortion issue to women and moderate voters. His
attention to this issue sends a powerful message that New York will
not tolerate terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The response from some anti-choice advocates is disturbing.
Michael Long, chairman of the state's Conservative Party,
characterized Pataki's announcement as ``pandering to the worst
abortion extremists.'' But it is not extreme to protect women and
doctors from threats and actual injury. Anti-abortion protesters
are free to voice their views, but they cannot be allowed to
prevent others from exercising their constitutionally protected
rights.

MILTON KUTSHER, 82, ASTUTE HOTELIER IN CATSKILLS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Mass., Pa.)   (See also: CONCORD-JOBLESS)  
 (bl)

<P>
   Milton Kutsher, who built Kutsher's Country Club into one of the
leading resorts in the Catskills and kept it successful even as
many other top hotels in the region lost their allure in the 1980s
and '90s, died Nov. 16 in Monticello, N.Y. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Kutsher's life spanned the rise and fall of the grand Catskills
resorts. He was born in Monticello in 1916, when the region was
still a sleepy mountain enclave of rooming houses where Jews in the
garment trade could escape the summer heat of the city for ``the
good air.'' By the middle of the century, the Catskills were world
famous as the Borscht Belt, a place of large, often luxurious
hotels and resorts where urban vacationers, mostly Jews still
hemmed in socially by anti-Semitism, could relax and unwind,
entertained by some of the most famous names in show business.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Kutsher died, the Catskills were in decline, a
region seemingly made vestigial by jet planes, air-conditioning and
the loosening of religion-based restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   But while other resorts like Grossinger's, the Concord and
Brown's have gone out of business or declared bankruptcy, Kutsher's
continues to prosper, a tribute, many say, to Milton Kutsher's
vision.
</P>
<P>
   He bound Kutsher's closely to big-time sports, attracting
heavyweight boxers like Ezzard Charles and Rocky Marciano, who used
Kutsher's as a training base in the 1950s. Professional basketball
players still come to Kutsher's for the annual Maurice Stokes
exhibition game, which raises money for needy former NBA players.
</P>
<P>
   Amateur sports was a major attraction in the Catskills. Resorts
would field basketball teams made up of staff members and compete
against one another, drawing visitors up from the city to watch
(and bet) on the games. Kutsher was an expert at hiring the best
high school and college players to work summers, like a skinny high
school student named Wilt Chamberlain, who worked there as a
bellhop in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got Wilt, I was looking around for the right coach to
work with him,'' Kutsher recalled years later. A guest told him
about a man who had once coached his son, and might need a job.
``That's how I got Red Auerbach to coach Kutsher's basketball
team,'' Kutsher said of the man who would later gain fame as the
coach of the Boston Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other resorts, Kutsher's in the 1960s had a roster of
comedians like Shecky Greene and Alan King, but as the years passed
Kutsher tried to keep the acts current. Until his television show
took off, Jerry Seinfeld was a frequent performer at Kutsher's,
said Kutsher's daughter Mady Prowler.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the few resorts that continues to attract a
crowd,'' said Myrna Katz Frommer, who, with her husband, Harvey
Frommer, wrote ``It Happened in the Catskills: An Oral History in
the Words of Busboys, Bellhops, Guests, Proprietors, Comedians,
Agents and Others Who Lived It'' (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1991).
``It's a very special place in that it has a true family feel. It's
luxurious without being tacky, and he never allowed it to get run
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Kutsher and his wife, the former Helen Wasser,
were a constant, visible presence. They appeared at every meal, and
they remembered the names of their guests. ``If she saw a piece of
paper on the floor, she'd pick it up,'' Ms. Frommer said. ``She'd
say, `This is MY home.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kutsher represented the second generation in his family to
operate Kutsher's, which was founded by his father and uncle in
1907. After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania in 1937
and serving in the Army in the Pacific during World War II, he
returned to Monticello and took over Kutsher's, expanding it from a
small operation into one of the region's biggest resorts; it now
has 410 rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Kutsher made sure that his children also became involved, and
today his son, Mark Kutsher, runs Kutsher's with Helen Kutsher.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife and son, Kutsher is survived by two
daughters, Ms. Prowler of Philadelphia and Karen Wilson of Bryn
Mawr, Pa., and seven grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the country club, Kutsher also ran Kutsher's Sport
Academy and a summer camp for children, and was a trustee of the
National Basketball Association Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   One thing Kutsher did not like was the term Borscht Belt. ``I
don't think he liked the idea that a place was depicted by a
soup,'' Ms. Prowler said. ``He thought it sounded too cliquish and
closed off to the world, though he had no problem with it being
known as a Jewish resort.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the hotel Thursday, Ms. Prowler said, ``This weekend
is totally booked,'' which would have been music to Kutsher's ears.

FAMED RESORT'S CLOSING LEAVES BLEAK PROSPECTS FOR LONGTIME
WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: This is a late add to page 1 of the city edition; also see
OBIT-KUTSHER, on the death of the owner of one of the few Catskills
hotels that has been able to survive)  
 (bl)  
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTICELLO, N.Y. _ It wasn't supposed to end this way. Not this
personally. Not this jarringly.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knew that the legendary Concord Resort Hotel in the
Catskills' Sullivan County was past its prime, unable to bring the
tourists back to what was once the crown jewel of the resort area.
Everyone knew that the hotel was in financial distress and
desperate to attract buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when the Concord closed Nov. 3 after 61 years under the
same family, it hurt more than anyone could have imagined. More
than 400 people lost their jobs, including many who had full-time
jobs at the hotel for 40 years. About 60 employees who had been
living in the hotel suddenly became homeless and found their next
meal at a soup kitchen. And everyone, it seemed, began flooding
local employment and welfare offices, looking for guidance and
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got to change your priorities from `What do we do
for our vacation?' to `What are we going to do for dinner or to pay
the rent?' it changes your priorities a lot,'' said Wesley Katz,
41, a former security guard at the Concord who was eating lunch at
Tom's Kitchen, the only soup kitchen in Monticello. ``I'm a
diabetic, too, so I have to make sure I have some medical
coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the Concord was marked with various elegiac
testimonials to the end of what had been a beloved institution, but
those impressive words have done little for the people who sweated
to make the Concord run so smoothly. Those people _ the waitresses,
the busboys, the porters _ are suffering mightily.
</P>
<P>
   The county has relatively few residents _ about 70,000 _ so its
support services are small and easily strapped. Although the county
has had low unemployment, the 400 who lost their jobs at the
Concord, when added to the 500 other jobs lost in the county this
year, have placed heavy demands on an economy that was already
pinched.
</P>
<P>
   For some time, it had not been easy to find a job _ not in
Kiamesha Lake, the community where the Concord is located, not in
Monticello, the county seat and a village of 6,800, nor in the
other nearby communities in the mountain region.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid that these people who have hung in there with the
hotel for so long are going to put a strain on the local economy,''
said Monticello Mayor Gary Sommers. ``I don't know what this is
going to do to the crime level, the homeless level, the welfare
level. We're very apprehensive, because the ripple effect is
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Concord workers say that almost all have applied for
unemployment benefits, and that some have applied for welfare and
Medicaid. Karen Burns, executive director of the Sullivan County
Federation for the Homeless, a nonprofit agency that operates Tom's
Kitchen, said it has been feeding twice as many as normal since the
Concord closed. The United Way has worked with county and state
agencies to set up an emergency site to help steer people to jobs
and retraining programs.
</P>
<P>
   A Wal-Mart that is to open next year will help some, said
Jonathan Drapkin, the county manager, but since winter is
approaching, others believe that the worst is yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've seen the crunch of what's going to
happen,'' said Linda Cellini, chief professional officer for the
United Way of Sullivan County. ``We don't have enough to meet the
needs of our county normally, so this extra burden on the emergency
food and shelter needs is just going to make things worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has never been to the Catskills may well wonder: Why
didn't the Concord workers get out earlier? After all, there were
plenty of warning signs: the hotel's bankruptcy, its pursuit of
financial suitors, its loss of guests to entertainment sites as far
away as Atlantic City, N.J., and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   But talking about changing jobs is usually easier than doing it,
especially after you have worked at a good-paying job at the same
place for so long. More than half the employees had put in more
than the 10 years required to qualify for a union pension. And in
years past, some of the workers said, they could get by in the
Catskills on the $10,000 to $30,000 a year they managed to take in
at the Concord.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, there was something else about the Concord that made it
more than just a place to draw a paycheck. Some employees had come
from New York City 90 miles away and had found rural life soothing.
Others had checkered pasts before coming to the Concord, and found
a second chance here. Still others enjoyed the camaraderie with the
long-time guests who returned often over the years. They came to
know many of them by their first names.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of good times, and everyone was like family,''
said Marilyn Gill, 56, a Queens native who worked as a waitress at
the Concord for 26 years. ``We really wanted to believe that there
would be last-minute miracle. We were in denial.''
</P>
<P>
   The hope had been that the hotel, which was about $20 million in
debt, might make it through the holiday season and that an
interested investor would snap it up and keep it going. But on Nov.
3, Robert Parker, whose family has owned the hotel since 1937, made
his tearful announcement that the hotel would be unable to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   All the workers lost their jobs and benefits with only a few
days' notice, but those who were living in the hotel, or the
adjacent dilapidated bungalows, had to pack their belongings and
look for shelter.
</P>
<P>
   It was an abrupt end for an institution that courted performers
like Jackie Mason and Buddy Hackett, had appealed to people looking
for a refuge from New York only 90 miles away, and had becomes a
popular place for people to get married or celebrate a bar mitzvah.
</P>
<P>
   But now, only a skeletal staff of about 30 people remain, mainly
security and maintenance workers. The hotel is tentatively
scheduled to be auctioned Dec. 2 at U.S. Bankruptcy Court in White
Plains. And while there has been much talk in the last year about
potential bidders who might renovate the 1,710-acre resort, no one
professes to know what will happen.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard for me to talk about,'' Parker said in a
telephone interview, his voice cracking. ``It's a tremendous
effect, psychologically and everything else. When you let go
employees you've known for 30 years, what do you tell them?''
</P>
<P>
   For union employees, the shock has been aggravated by the
actions of their union, Local 76 of the Hotel and Restaurant
Employees and Bartenders Union. The workers said the local had
refused to allow them to draw early from their $6.8 million pension
fund. The local also says they cannot draw their pensions until
they are 65, although the contract provide for retirement at 60.
They said officials at the local maintained that the hotel's
closure had nullified the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gill would have to wait another nine years to receive her
$550 a month; it means that Jorge Pelosi, 33, who has worked at the
Concord as a busboy for 16 years, would have to wait until he is 65
to receive a pension of perhaps $250 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials did not return calls requesting comment.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, more than 150 union employees attended a rally of
union members, organized by Ms. Gill, Pat Kislowski and Joe Blum to
challenge the union local leadership. ``Just give us something now,
because we don't know if there will be any money left in the
future,'' said Ms. Gill, at the rally at Apollo Plaza, a strip mall
in Monticello. ``Otherwise, we're all going to be wards of the
county.''
</P>
<P>
   How much workers can get from the union remains to be seen,
since they can't afford a lawyer, and they have had little help so
far from the state Department of Labor. But if anything, the rally
was more for commiseration than confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Martinez, who turned 60 Thursday, had worked as a chef at
the Concord since 1958. He had hoped to retire soon; more
immediately, he had been planning to visit his ailing 89-year-old
mother in Puerto Rico this winter. But not any more. ``It's been a
shock, just a shock,'' said a sullen Martinez, who has applied for
jobs at three hotels in the area. ``I'm scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda DaCosta, 50, is worried, too. She worked as a waitress at
the Concord since 1988, but she and the union disagree on how much
time she has put in; she says 10 years, the union says nine. She
has had to cut back on some things, like taking her grandson to a
store to buy a toy, like going out to a restaurant or a movie once
in a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't afford that extra $5 or $10,'' she said. ``People ask
me, `What's the difference?' and I joke around with them, sort of.
I say to them, `It's the difference between cat food and tuna
fish.'''
</P>
<P>
   Those hardest hit may be the workers who lived at the Concord.
</P>
<P>
   When Ernest Parker (bartender, 12 years) and Robert Matthews
(cook, two years) were forced to leave, they found nothing except a
dingy room at the Heritage Motel for $140 a week. Both have had no
luck finding work; both have vouchers from the county for a one-way
bus ticket to New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bowman, 38, a Brooklyn native who had worked in the
hotel's dining room for three years, is trying a different tack: He
is staying in the bungalows illegally, without a phone and barely
enough heat. An asthmatic who has no car, Bowman has to walk about
an hour each way to the employment office to look at the latest
jobs. So far, nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Wilson, 52, is also a Brooklyn native _
Bedford-Stuyvesant. Until two years ago, he had never left home.
Then, when he heard there was work in the Catskills, he took the
next bus and got a job, with room and board, as a porter at the
Concord. When the hotel closed, he had no car and no family nearby.
He moved in with a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my first time in a soup kitchen, but I do what the
Romans do,'' Wilson said softly, after stuffing a piece of kielbasa
in his mouth at Tom's Kitchen. ``I didn't feel I'd end up like
this.''

GLOBAL TREND SEEN IN GERMAN BANK DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Germany)  (js) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the board of Bankers Trust Corp. meets Sunday to
vote on the sale of the bank to Deutsche Bank AG of Germany for
about $9 billion, Wall Street is rife with speculation about
whether a new round of megamergers is at hand.
</P>
<P>
   The expected deal is yet another example of how economic
globalization is forcing companies to form once unthinkable
cross-border alliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are playing in a global space now,'' said David
Berry, a financial analyst with Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods Inc. ``And
to be in the business of financing multinational corporations, you
need to have a global presence, and you need to be in the U.S.
because that's where the money and the talent are.''
</P>
<P>
   But industry analysts and bank advisers said banking executives
were not rushing to cut deals like the huge marriages of other
financial services giants completed in the last year. Lower stock
prices and an uncertain economic landscape are still combining to
dampen merger fever.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many respects Bankers Trust is a unique case, and there
aren't a lot of other big buyers out there,'' said Charles Peabody,
an analyst with Mitchell Securities Inc. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In its deal for Bankers Trust, Deutsche Bank is clearly being
driven by a desire to have greater global reach and a stronger
presence in the United States, despite its ill-fated attempts to
jump into investment banking previously.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is expected to be announced Monday, with Deutsche Bank
paying about $90 a share for Bankers Trust, in what would be the
biggest takeover of a U.S. financial institution by a foreign bank.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a cooler reception on Wall Street for mergers, some U.S.
institutions may feel compelled to follow Deutsche Bank's lead.
Such moves would probably be limited to the top tier of U.S. banks
that already have an international presence or have stated their
intentions to develop such a presence.
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan Corp., which had serious merger discussions with
the Swiss banking concern Credit Suisse and made repeated merger
overtures to Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. earlier this year, may be on the
hunt again. Other possible partners for Chase include Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, and Paine
Webber.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., which is certain to be the subject of renewed
merger speculation, is much more financially sound than Bankers
Trust and has repeatedly stated its intention to remain
independent.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche's plunge into high-stakes investment banking is out of
fashion these days. Many European and Japanese firms have already
retreated from Wall Street in the last couple of years, because
they found it either too expensive or too difficult to break into
that highly competitive world.
</P>
<P>
   But by paying a premium of about $13 for Bankers Trust over its
stock price on Friday, Deutsche is showing a renewed willingness to
flex its muscles here.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the deal said Saturday that Frank Newman,
Bankers Trust's chief executive, would be made co-chief executive
of the new investment banking unit created by Deutsche's
acquisition of his company. It is uncertain how long Newman plans
to stay on in that role, although executives involved in the merger
talks dismissed the likelihood that Citigroup's former president,
James Dimon, would take over that business.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust has 20,539 employees, with 11,399 in the United
States and 9,140 overseas. It was already considering cutting its
work force before this merger neared its conclusion, and there will
probably be substantial layoffs after the merger is announced.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Under Newman, Bankers Trust has focused its activities on
investment banking for small and mid-sized companies and junk bond
underwriting. It also has a sizable syndicated lending business and
is trying to bulk up its business as a securities custodian and a
cash manager. Although more than 40 percent of its revenue has come
from abroad in recent years, the bank has been scaling back its
emerging markets activities and its trading operation.
</P>
<P>
   The sale, however, is the result of Newman's inability to turn
the company around quickly enough in an era when only a few big
companies are seen as dominating the investment banking world.
Bankers Trust has also been badly damaged by recent trading losses
that caused certain of the bank's capital requirements to fall
below acceptable regulatory standards in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Such losses were exactly the kind of events Newman's hiring was
supposed to prevent. He came to the bank from a post with the
Treasury Department and an earlier position with BankAmerica Corp.,
and had the reputation of being a conservative, risk-averse
executive. Newman's penchant for high-living _ he has spent
lavishly on his offices, glittering Manhattan soirees and other
executive perks _ has alienated many at Bankers Trust, and support
for him from the bank's board has weakened.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts said, however, that Newman faced an uphill battle
trying to remake Bankers Trust. ``When he signed on, he didn't have
the strongest cards in the deck, and then he got shellacked this
summer by big trading losses,'' Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is technically a commercial bank, Bankers Trust has
more of an investment banking profile, especially with its recent
moves into equities-related businesses. The biggest move was to
purchase Alex. Brown of Baltimore in a deal valued at $1.7 billion.
It also bought National Westminster PLC's European equities
business and the U.S. investment banking boutique Wolfensohn &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   But Banker's Trust has had a rocky start with Alex. Brown, and
the Wolfensohn acquisition is regarded by experts as something of a
bust.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several of Alex. Brown's most senior executives left
the firm, including the heads of its investment banking and asset
management operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went from having a solid business that everyone understands
to one that has a new surprise every day,'' an Alex. Brown
executive said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, investors also appear to have grown tired of Newman
and of Bankers Trust's inability to produce better returns. Between
December 1995, when Newman took over, to this month, the company
has provided an annualized return on equity of about 16 percent,
compared with about 30 percent for its peers, according to Keefe
Bruyette &AMP; Woods. And on Wall Street, a sagging stock price usually
translates into a sale _ whether the company likes it or not.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche will still have a lot of work to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investment banking business appears to be attractive
because the fees can be huge,'' said Sallie Krawcheck, an analyst
with Sanford C. Bernstein. ``But the bottom line is that there is
severe overcapacity. Only a handful of the top firms make money on
underwriting.''
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust's shares rose sharply on Friday, climbing $5.25,
or 7.3 percent, to $77.25, because of the merger speculation.

<P>
   SEATTLE _ It was Saturday night at the Providence-Mount St.
Vincent nursing home. Marie Swegle, 96, and her friends on the
fifth floor were lingering at the dinner table in their
wheelchairs, watching the news. John Glenn had safely returned to
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Swegle, who a year before had learned to walk again after
falling and breaking her neck, was not overly impressed by the
77-year-old astronaut. Neither was Effie Constantine, at 67 a good
15 years younger than anyone else at the table but crippled by
hydrocephalus. ``It's a waste of money, sending him up in space,''
she said. ``Why don't they spend the money to study aging on
earth?''
</P>
<P>
   One place to start such a study might be at Providence-Mount St.
Vincent, a five-story building surrounded by gardens at the top of
a hill overlooking Elliott Bay. The Mount, as those who live there
call it, is widely regarded to be what many Americans consider an
impossibility: a good nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   As well as the Mount works, though, it cannot alter the stark
realities of aging that its residents confront every day: the
spouses, friends and even children outlived; the physical
limitations; the loss of independence and control. These are men
and women who survived the Depression; who fought in World War II;
who worked as farmers, teachers, office managers, bus drivers and
engineers; who raised families and ran houses; who now need help to
go to the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   As nursing homes change and adapt under the pressure of managed
care and Medicaid rules, even the visionary administrator behind
the Mount, Robert Ogden, says it would be preferable for nursing
homes to cease to exist _ for people to be able to remain at home
or in some other setting in their community. And alternatives are
increasingly available.
</P>
<P>
   But meanwhile, with nearly half of all Americans who reach 65
expected to spend time in a nursing home, health care professionals
are looking to the Mount and a handful of places like it for
answers.
</P>
<P>
   Its current administrator, Charlene Boyd, says there is no
reason the Mount cannot be duplicated. Money is a factor, she
acknowledged; at about $60,000 a year, the Mount costs about
$10,000 more than the national average. Yet half of its residents
depend on Medicaid. More important is breaking free of rigid rules
and routines that assume residents are helpless.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Mount is the last community for most of its
residents, what is possible within a limited budget? How good can
the end of the road be?
</P>
<P>
   The residents of the Mount are not the so-called active senior
generation, the attractive silver-haired people celebrated in the
media playing golf and going on cruises. The lucky ones among them
are those who can walk, with walkers, and those who, as the
residents put it, ``have all their marbles.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to lump them together: a group of men and women in
wheelchairs, a few staring vacantly, others nodding off. Even those
who are fully aware are often unable, because of impairments, to
show by their expressions or gestures just how alive they are.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Thode, the recreation coordinator, and other staff
members take pains to point out each individual. That 92-year old,
the one moaning ``Oh dear, oh dear,'' lived in a sod house in
Alaska with her husband during World War II. The 81-year-old whose
stroke left her struggling to utter a sentence? She once was an
international toastmistress. The 83-year-old tethered to a feeding
tube, who on some days doesn't know where he is, happens to be a
much loved husband and father, who last week sat clutching a letter
from his son, telling how his seventh-grade son had just gone to
his first school dance with a girl.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, the Mount was exactly the sort of place
everyone dreaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very traditional nursing home _ very institutional,
very cold,'' said Ogden, who became the administrator in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The Mount's nursing home was opened by the Sisters of Providence
in 1967, the beginning of a mass construction of nursing homes
across the country financed by a new federal health care program
for the poor, Medicaid. For lack of any other model, these new
institutions, something more than rest homes or old-age homes, were
patterned after hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   With Medicaid guaranteeing income, the care of the frail elderly
became big business. And the dramatic increase in longevity,
combined with the transformation in society brought by increasing
mobility and women going to work, meant a growing need for
institutional care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody ever used to think of putting their grandparents in a
nursing home,'' said Maureen Gladstone, 62, a nurse on the fifth
floor whose grandmother lived with her family when she was growing
up. ``She helped raise us. Then when she got older, we took care of
her.''
</P>
<P>
   In the old Mount, everything revolved around the staff members
and their schedules. The day shift arrived at 6 a.m. and started
getting everyone up for breakfast, whether they wanted to or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know any better,'' said Ogden, who is now a regional
director of long-term care and housing for the Sisters of
Providence. ``Our definition of care was to protect people to the
point where they had no freedom, no dignity. We didn't want them to
fall. We didn't want to be hurt by anything. The best thing we
could think of to do was to put them away.''
</P>
<P>
   State regulators gave the Mount top ratings. That was how things
worked in nursing homes, and how they still work in many.
</P>
<P>
   As speculators and profiteers rushed into the business,
conditions in the worst nursing homes led to scandals that helped
shape Americans' fear of nursing homes. The scandals also prompted
Congress to enact the 1987 Nursing Home Reform Law. Conditions
slowly began to improve. Some health professionals began to talk
about a new way of looking at nursing homes, one stressing the
quality of residents' lives.
</P>
<P>
   At the Mount, by then operated by the nonprofit Sisters of
Providence Health System, Ogden and his assistant, Charlene Boyd,
who has since succeeded him, began working with a team to carry out
the new philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Each floor was divided into ``neighborhoods'' of about 20
residents each with their own dining room and kitchen. Anyone could
get a snack or a cup of coffee at any time. White walls were
painted pastel shades and hung with art. Floors were carpeted.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Residents were no longer automatically tied down at night in the
name of protecting them. ``The nurses came unglued,'' Ogden said.
``They said the patients might fall out of bed. Some did. We picked
them up and put them back. They slept better.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical diets calibrated down to the last gram of sugar and salt
were thrown out or modified. ``I went back to the docs and said,
`Does this really matter?' '' Ogden said. ``They said, `No, not if
you're 85.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone predicted disaster when Ogden decided to unlock the
56-bed Alzheimer's ward on the fourth floor and mix its residents
with everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty percent of the social workers walked out,'' said one
aide, Tamara Allen, who vehemently opposed the move but now is so
sold on the change that she gives speeches about it at conferences.
``We just couldn't imagine how it would be.''
</P>
<P>
   That there were problems with the old way, she could not deny.
In her trademark speech, she describes the caste system that still
operates in many nursing homes: ``Independent residents look down
on the residents that need help, and they in turn look down on the
residents who are confused.''
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Gladstone, the nurse, recalled the fears of ``the alerts
and non-agitateds'' _ jargon for those without dementia. ``I asked
them, `What is it about them that bothers you?' '' she said. ``They
were afraid they'd be that way. It's like a mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   But chaos did not erupt. On the contrary, Alzheimer's patients
became less agitated. When those who seemed likely to wander off
were fitted with ankle bracelets that would signal when they were
leaving, and through which door, ``They didn't seem to roam
around,'' Ms. Gladstone said. ``Just the idea that they could go
wherever they wanted _ they didn't want to anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Adjusting to a nursing home can be more difficult for those who
are not demented.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago Ruth Skoog, a former freelance writer for The
Seattle Times, had an apartment of her own in the assisted-living
half of the Mount. She was a big wheel, serving on the
all-important food committee and the residents council and joining
all the organized outings. Then back-to-back strokes partly
paralyzed her and she crossed the hall into the nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   The other evening Mrs. Skoog was at dinner on the third floor.
``She's got all her marbles,'' she said, paying the ultimate
compliment to the woman in the wheelchair beside her, Ann
Hasslinger, a former marathon runner who, at a youthful 43, has
advanced multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   The same could not be said of many of the women, in their 80s
and 90s, around them. ``This is appalling,'' Mrs. Skoog said. ``If
my husband could see me now, he would die. He hated to visit his
own mother in the nursing home.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Skoog wishes there were more people she could talk to, and
yet she carries on. She questions aides closely about life outside
the Mount. Ms. Heath even says her complaining is a sign of health.
As the former Miss West Seattle went off in her wheelchair for her
weekly hair appointment, she said, ``One has to keep up one's
image.''
</P>
<P>
   Nursing homes look different to people depending on their age,
their health, their stage of life. In their 70s, Dick and Esther
Gorman made a pledge: No nursing homes. But when the couple turned
80 together, they began down a path that would lead them to an
assisted-living apartment at the Mount _ and the understanding that
someday they might move across the corridor, to the nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to all their friends, Gorman related why they
began searching for a final home and what they learned. Their
health, ``while very good was starting to show signs of changes
typical of eighty year olds,'' he wrote. ``Although we were quite
sound organically, it had become apparent we were experiencing some
memory loss, loss of energy, occasional confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Visiting retirement communities and assisted-living facilities,
including the Mount, ``we found each had its share of quite
disabled people and that frequently they would be sitting
(sometimes sprawled out and/or asleep) in the lobby. This was
culture shock for us, seeing all these old people.''
</P>
<P>
   They decided not to move until they absolutely had to _ but soon
they reconsidered. Looking at themselves more closely, he wrote,
``we began to see that we weren't that far away from being those
old people whose presence upset us.'' In June 1997 they moved to
the Mount.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, 18 residents the Gormans knew have died. ``There's a
sort of unspoken agreement among people who are here that mortality
is real, but nothing to worry about,'' said Gorman, who is
president of the assisted-living residents council. ``You have to
consider that a part of living is deteriorating.''
</P>
<P>
   And now that he makes regular visits to the nursing home to
visit friends, including Mrs. Skoog, he says it no longer holds the
horror that it once did. ``We're all heading in that direction,''
he said.

<P>
   SEATTLE _ It was Saturday night at the Providence-Mount St.
Vincent nursing home. Marie Swegle, 96, and her friends on the
fifth floor were lingering at the dinner table in their
wheelchairs, watching the news. John Glenn had safely returned to
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Swegle, who a year before had learned to walk again after
falling and breaking her neck, was not overly impressed by the
77-year-old astronaut. Neither was Effie Constantine, at 67 a good
15 years younger than anyone else at the table but crippled by
hydrocephalus. ``It's a waste of money, sending him up in space,''
she said. ``Why don't they spend the money to study aging on
earth?''
</P>
<P>
   One place to start such a study might be at Providence-Mount St.
Vincent, a five-story building surrounded by gardens at the top of
a hill overlooking Elliott Bay. The Mount, as those who live there
call it, is widely regarded to be what many Americans consider an
impossibility: a good nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   That is to say, in an industry freighted with the dread of old
age, disability and loneliness, and periodically tainted by scandal
and abuse, the Mount has found ways to be a home to people who can
no longer care for themselves, to provide a sense of community in a
place where no one wants to be, to be a community that is more
about living than about dying.
</P>
<P>
   The Mount is a place where Mrs. Swegle finds life sweet enough
that she talks about wanting to make it to 100, where her friend
down the hall, Vivian Grenfell, 83, who has a painful bone disease,
looks forward to Fridays because that is when staff members help
her put on her bathing suit and take her to a neighborhood pool so
they can help her move her arms and legs in the water. Swimming is
making her stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Grenfell, a retired dressmaker, belongs to a weekly ladies'
luncheon group at the Mount, serves on the ethics committee and
writes a column for its newspaper. Things were different at her
first nursing home, she said: ``You went in your room, you went in
your bed. You didn't do much of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   As well as the Mount works, though, it cannot alter the stark
realities of aging that its residents confront every day: the
spouses, friends and even children outlivedl; the physical
limitations; the loss of independence and control. These are men
and women who survived the Depression; who fought in World War II;
who worked as farmers, teachers, office managers, bus drivers and
engineers; who raised families and ran houses; who now need help to
go to the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Each floor of the Mount is divided in half, one side nursing
home, the other assisted-living apartments for less-dependent
residents. While some people come here, get well and return home,
for most the Mount is the last address. ``It's the end of the
road,'' said 84-year-old Ruth Skoog, who grew up, graduated from
high school, got married and raised a family in West Seattle at the
bottom of the hill, and now, after two strokes, has arrived in Room
317 at the top.
</P>
<P>
   The nursing home's population of 215 men and women is similar to
that of most nursing homes: the sickest and most severely disabled
elderly. The average age is 88. Eighty percent of the residents
suffer from some degree of dementia.
</P>
<P>
   When you are at the Mount, most of what staff members do day in
and day out hardly seems extraordinary. The aides, nurses and
social workers keep the residents clean and fed, take time to talk
and to listen, and treat everyone _ even the most demented _ with
respect and dignity. They enliven the atmosphere with the stuff of
ordinary life: plants, pets, pictures on the wall, visits from
children. This being Seattle, there is a coffee bar. The old enjoy
a cup of latte, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not rocket science,'' said Kevin Bail, a social worker
who oversees the fifth floor. ``It's basic stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   As nursing homes change and adapt under the pressure of managed
care and Medicaid rules, even the visionary administrator behind
the Mount, Robert Ogden, says it would be preferable for nursing
homes to cease to exist _ for people to be able to remain at home
or in some other setting in their community. And alternatives are
increasingly available.
</P>
<P>
   But meanwhile, with nearly half of all Americans who reach 65
expected to spend time in a nursing home, health care professionals
are looking to the Mount and a handful of places like it for
answers.
</P>
<P>
   Its current administrator, Charlene Boyd, says there is no
reason the Mount cannot be duplicated. Money is a factor, she
acknowledged; at about $60,000 a year, the Mount costs about
$10,000 more than the national average. Yet half of its residents
depend on Medicaid. More important is breaking free of rigid rules
and routines that assume residents are helpless.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Mount is the last community for most of its
residents, what is possible within a limited budget? How good can
the end of the road be?
</P>
<P>
   The Condition: Aging Residents Live with Pain and Loss
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a dilapidating disease,'' Vivian Grenfell's roommate,
Effie Constantine, was explaining to a visitor.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Grenfell corrected her: ``You mean debilitating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right, debilitating _ that sounds better,'' Mrs. Constantine
said. ``But I feel dilapidated.''
</P>
<P>
   They are all, in one way or another, debilitated and
dilapidated, cut down by strokes, heart disease, Parkinson's,
arthritis, osteoporosis, cancer, dementia and the sheer advance of
time, dependent on Digoxin, Darvocet, Trazodone, Paxil, Tylenol and
for calcium, nearly all of them, Tums. This is the condition that
awaits anyone who lives long enough. And with the rapid growth in
the 85-and-over population, it is a condition that increasing
numbers of people will know. More than 1.5 million Americans live
in nursing homes now.
</P>
<P>
   Frances Mara was talking recently about how her father died of
influenza in 1918, before he reached 40. Mrs. Mara, who spends her
days alone in her room watching CNN, got her annual flu shot a few
weeks ago. She is 84.
</P>
<P>
   Though her hands are so bent and stiff from arthritis that she
can no longer do the sewing she once enjoyed, a condition that no
doubt contributes to her depression, Mrs. Mara never fails to vote,
even if she needs help holding the pen to mark her absentee ballot.
Voter turnout is high at the Mount.
</P>
<P>
   But these survivors, many of them stoical in the face of
enormous pain and loss, win no honor from a society that promotes
longevity but denies death and shuns its emissaries, the frail
elderly. ``I see people back away from them when we go on trips,''
said Laurie Thode, a recreational coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   They are not the so-called active senior generation, the
attractive silver-haired people celebrated in the media playing
golf and going on cruises. The lucky ones among them are those who
can walk, with walkers, and those who, as the residents put it,
``have all their marbles.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to lump them together: a group of men and women in
wheelchairs, a few staring vacantly, others nodding off. Even those
who are fully aware are often unable, because of impairments, to
show by their expressions or gestures just how alive they are.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thode and other staff members take pains to point out each
individual. That 92-year old, the one moaning, ``oh dear, oh
dear,'' lived in a sod house in Alaska with her husband during
World War II. The 81-year-old whose stroke left her struggling to
utter a sentence? She once was an international toastmistress. The
83-year-old tethered to a feeding tube, who on some days doesn't
know where he is, happens to be a much-loved husband and father,
who last week sat clutching a letter from his son, telling how his
seventh-grade son had just gone to his first school dance with a
girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me, how do you do this work day in and day out?''
said Susan Scully, the social worker on the second floor. She tells
them she enjoys the residents, and she means it _ speaking as a
social worker. ``Things would be different,'' she said, ``if they
were my parents.''

   The Approach: Respect, Dignity Guide Care at the Mount
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning: The weekly meeting of the third-floor residents
was in session in the bird room, a cozy lounge with plush carpeting
and big windows and an aviary.
</P>
<P>
   Karla Heath, the registered nurse who oversees the floor, wanted
to know if anyone had a complaint. How were the meals? Were they
getting up in the morning when they wanted? What about the
activities?
</P>
<P>
   The finches were chirping away. The 11 people present _ about a
fourth of the floor _ were mostly quiet, as usual. Rose Wilson, 81,
did not breathe a word about the third-floor cat, Kit, who had
singled out her bed for his afternoon naps; Mrs. Wilson hates cats.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just that the residents are mostly pleased with the
Mount, Ms. Heath would explain later. Most have already spent their
savings to pay for their care, and are on Medicaid; those who are
not will be in a matter of months. There is an underlying fear that
if they complain, they might lose the last piece of security they
have in the world: their beds here.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents have come from other nursing homes, where they
learned what it was like to wait 30 minutes or more for an aide to
respond to a call button for a bathroom emergency. (At the Mount,
aides must respond within three minutes.) ``I just think they are
very aware that they are dependent on others,'' Ms. Heath said.
</P>
<P>
   Pressing on, Ms. Heath asked the group, ``What about the food?
Are you getting what you want? It's OK to ask for something
different for breakfast.''
</P>
<P>
   Alice Berg, 90, who used to serve coffee and snacks on the state
ferry to Vashon Island, volunteered that she had requested toast
and orange juice that very morning. For Mrs. Berg, who daily
proclaims her delight in every aspect of the Mount, it was an
assertive step forward.
</P>
<P>
   Lois Boppell, 87, who was born with cerebral palsy and had a job
sorting bolts for Boeing, managed to get out, in her slurred
speech, that she would like more fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Lillian Reeder, 85, a retired elementary teacher with a bad
heart, also had a request: ``I would like more chopped up turkey,
chicken and beef. It's easier to swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider it done, Ms. Heath assured them.
</P>
<P>
   She ended the meeting with a pep talk: ``Everyone's going to go
out there and speak up more for what they want, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, the Mount was exactly the sort of place
everyone dreaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very traditional nursing home _ very institutional,
very cold,'' said Ogden, who became the administrator in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The Mount's nursing home was opened by the Sisters of Providence
in 1967, the beginning of a mass construction of nursing homes
across the country financed by a new federal health care program
for the poor, Medicaid. For lack of any other model, these new
institutions, something more than rest homes or old-age homes, were
patterned after hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   With Medicaid guaranteeing income, the care of the frail elderly
became big business. And the dramatic increase in longevity,
combined with the transformation in society brought by increasing
mobility and women going to work, meant a growing need for
institutional care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody ever used to think of putting their grandparents in a
nursing home,'' said Maureen Gladstone, 62, a nurse on the fifth
floor whose grandmother lived with her family when she was growing
up. ``She helped raise us. Then when she got older, we took care of
her.''
</P>
<P>
   In the old Mount, everything revolved around the staff members
and their schedules. The day shift arrived at 6 a.m. and started
getting everyone up for breakfast, whether they wanted to or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know any better,'' said Ogden, who is now a regional
director of long-term care and housing for the Sisters of
Providence. ``Our definition of care was to protect people to the
point where they had no freedom, no dignity. We didn't want them to
fall. We didn't want to be hurt by anything. The best thing we
could think of to do was to put them away.''
</P>
<P>
   State regulators gave the Mount top ratings. That was how things
worked in nursing homes, and how they still work in many.
</P>
<P>
   As speculators and profiteers rushed into the business,
conditions in the worst nursing homes led to scandals that helped
shape Americans' fear of nursing homes. The scandals also prompted
Congress to enact the 1987 Nursing Home Reform Law. Conditions
slowly began to improve. Some health professionals began to talk
about a new way of looking at nursing homes, one stressing the
quality of residents' lives.
</P>
<P>
   At the Mount, by then operated by the nonprofit Sisters of
Providence Health System, Ogden and his assistant, Charlene Boyd,
who has since succeeded him, began working with a team to carry out
the new philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Each floor was divided into ``neighborhoods'' of about 20
residents each with their own dining room and kitchen. Anyone could
get a snack or a cup of coffee at any time. White walls were
painted pastel shades and hung with art. Floors were carpeted.
</P>
<P>
   Residents were no longer automatically tied down at night in the
name of protecting them. ``The nurses came unglued,'' Ogden said.
``They said the patients might fall out of bed. Some did. We picked
them up and put them back. They slept better.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical diets calibrated down to the last gram of sugar and salt
were thrown out or modified. ``I went back to the docs and said,
`Does this really matter?' '' Ogden said. ``They said, `No, not if
you're 85.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Supervisory positions were eliminated and the money saved went
to hire more aides. For all the innovations, for all the plants,
pets and talk of vision, the success of the Mount comes down to the
aides. They are the ones who spend the most time with the
residents, bathing, dressing, feeding, changing and talking with
them.
</P>
<P>
   At night, Ruth Skoog turns to her aide, Gloria Alderman, for
comfort. ``I say, `Gloria sing me a song; I don't feel so good,' ''
Mrs. Skoog said the other evening as Ms. Alderman, who is a gospel
singer, fed her a dinner of pureed food, a necessity because of
Mrs. Skoog's bowel problems.
</P>
<P>
   In another nursing home, Mrs. Skoog might be classified as a
``feeder.'' To Ms. Alderman and the other aides, Mrs. Skoog is a
beauty queen; they all know she won the Miss West Seattle crown
when she was 18, and they see to it that her nails are manicured
and her lipstick is fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Aides at most nursing homes are paid little more than minimum
wage. The Mount pays about $10 an hour. But pay is just part of the
difference. Aides are trained in what the Mount calls
``resident-directed care'' _ what it means, how to make it work,
why the Mount believes in it.
</P>
<P>
   Every aide is part of a team that cares for a specific group of
residents. Other staff members, including nurses and social
workers, help them when they need help. And aides are recognized
throughout the year with gifts, special days and opportunities to
attend professional conferences. There is turnover _ about 30
percent a year _ but the average nursing home has 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the aides are from Africa and Southeast Asia. They all
comment that they never saw a nursing home until they came to
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have these kinds of facilities,'' said Tesfaye
Begosa, who is from Ethiopia. ``Whenever your parents get old, you
just take them to your place.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Unconventional: Mixing Residents To End Hierarchy
</P>
<P>
   Everyone predicted disaster when Ogden decided to unlock the
56-bed Alzheimer's ward on the fourth floor and mix its residents
with everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty percent of the social workers walked out,'' said one
aide, Tamara Allen, who vehemently opposed the move but now is so
sold on the change that she gives speeches about it at conferences.
``We just couldn't imagine how it would be.''
</P>
<P>
   That there were problems with the old way, she could not deny.
In her trademark speech, she describes the caste system that still
operates in many nursing homes: ``Independent residents look down
on the residents that need help, and they in turn look down on the
residents who are confused.''
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Gladstone, the nurse, recalled the fears of ``the alerts
and non-agitateds'' _ jargon for those without dementia. ``I asked
them, `What is it about them that bothers you?' '' she said. ``They
were afraid they'd be that way. It's like a mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   But chaos did not erupt. On the contrary, Alzheimer's patients
became less agitated. When those who seemed likely to wander off
were fitted with ankle bracelets that would signal when they were
leaving, and through which door. ``They didn't seem to roam
around,'' Ms. Gladstone said. ``Just the idea that they could go
wherever they wanted _ they didn't want to anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlocking the fourth floor was an effort to eliminate the
hierarchy that defines most nursing homes, where floors are
organized by disability and impairment, forcing frail elderly
people who have already given up their homes and their communities
to move again as they decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was terrified of moving to the fourth floor,'' Ms.
Boyd said.
</P>
<P>
   A Dilemma: Balancing a Range Of People's Needs
</P>
<P>
   Vivian Grenfell and Marie Swegle were having dinner with five
other residents at their regular table on the fifth floor. The
conversation turned to a recent outing to the new Nordstrom's
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not exaggerating, it's the most beautiful store I've ever
seen,'' said Mrs. Swegle, who taught elementary school before she
was married, attends mass daily in the Mount's chapel and manages
to look regal in her neck brace and collar, accessorized with a
string of pearls. ``I saw a hat I liked. It had a turned-up brim,
and a little bit of red in it. My better sense told me I was
getting too old to buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another woman at the table, who has Alzheimer's, was focused on
the corn on her plate. ``I just love corn,'' she repeated several
times, with a radiant smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``She fits in beautifully,'' Effie Constantine had said earlier
of her tablemate.
</P>
<P>
   At another table, a woman with dementia whose tendency toward
foul language has made her something of an outcast was crying out:
``Help, I can't walk! Don't undress me! Help!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I'm very inadequate,'' she said imploringly to Tamara
Allen, the aide.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Allen put her arm around her and stroked her hair. ``You're
not,'' she said. ``You're fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Listened to night after night, the ravings of the unmoored have
become the background noise of the fifth floor, like the television
that is sometimes left on. Much of it, fortunately, is lost on
those residents who are hard of hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good thing they mixed in the Alzheimer's
people,'' Mrs. Swegle volunteered. She recalled a visit she made to
the old locked fourth floor. ``I went up to see a friend of mine,''
she said. ``It frightened me. One woman came at me with a stick.
It's because they had been shut up together for so long. I think it
got on their nerves. It's better to be out.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my neighbors came down with Alzheimer's,'' she added.
``She's here. I see her every once in a while. She makes very
sensible remarks.''
</P>
<P>
   Things have been more difficult on the third floor, where
87-year-old Maxine Christian's dementia causes her to moan and cry
out continually.
</P>
<P>
   ``What am I going to do about Maxine?'' Ms. Heath said the other
day in exasperation. She had tried changes in medication, lab tests
that might detect a physical problem, music, a rocking chair, art
projects with a recreational coordinator, Niki Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Heath had spent hours trying to comfort Mrs. Christian.
``What's wrong, Maxine?'' she had asked her, over and over. Mrs.
Christian, a former artist who can no longer paint, and whose son
died of leukemia at age 45, never had an answer.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Heath said she wished she could give Mrs. Christian a
private room, in part to spare her roommate, but private rooms are
few and hard to come by at the Mount. In an ideal world, she said,
everyone in a nursing home could have a private room.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ms. Heath had summoned Mrs. Christian's husband of 60 years,
Ed. Seated at a table in her office, the 86-year-old retired
electrician wept as she told him she had to think of the 40 other
residents on the floor. ``She's disrupting the community,'' she
said. When it comes to Mrs. Christian, apparently, the residents
are not shy about complaining. ``They're all saying, `Can't you do
something?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is she the worst one you've ever had?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The answer was no. Ms. Heath, her own eyes watering, put her
hand on his arm.
</P>
<P>
   A week or so later, with still no improvement, Ms. Heath said
one solution, which she was not crazy about, might be to increase
Mrs. Christian's anti-anxiety medication. She did not want to
consider the other alternative, discharging Mrs. Christian and
leaving her husband to find another nursing home. ``We're just
going to have to make it work,'' she said.

</P>
<P>
   The Adjustment: A New Life, With Ups and Downs
</P>
<P>
   Adjusting to a nursing home can be more difficult for those who
are not demented.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago Ruth Skoog, a former freelance writer for The
Seattle Times, had an apartment of her own in the assisted-living
half of the Mount. She was a big wheel, serving on the
all-important food committee and the residents council and joining
all the organized outings. Then back-to-back strokes partly
paralyzed her and she crossed the hall into the nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   The other evening Mrs. Skoog was at dinner on the third floor.
``She's got all her marbles,'' she said, paying the ultimate
compliment to the woman in the wheelchair beside her, Ann
Hasslinger, a former marathon runner who, at a youthful 43, has
advanced multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   The same could not be said of many of the women, in their 80s
and 90s, around them. ``This is appalling,'' Mrs. Skoog said. ``If
my husband could see me now, he would die. He hated to visit his
own mother in the nursing home.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Skoog wishes there were more people she could talk to, and
yet she carries on. She questions aides closely about life outside
the Mount. Ms. Heath even says her complaining is a sign of health.
As the former Miss West Seattle went off in her wheelchair for her
weekly hair appointment, she said, ``One has to keep up one's
image.''
</P>
<P>
   Nursing homes look different to people depending on their age,
their health, their stage of life. In their 70s, Dick and Esther
Gorman made a pledge: No nursing homes. But when the couple turned
80 together, they began down a path that would lead them to an
assisted-living apartment at the Mount _ and the understanding that
someday they might move across the corridor, to the nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to all their friends, Gorman related why they
began searching for a final home and what they learned. Their
health, ``while very good was starting to show signs of changes
typical of 80-year olds,'' he wrote. ``Although we were quite sound
organically, it had become apparent we were experiencing some
memory loss, loss of energy, occasional confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Visiting retirement communities and assisted-living facilities,
including the Mount, ``we found each had its share of quite
disabled people and that frequently they would be sitting
(sometimes sprawled out and/or asleep) in the lobby. This was
culture shock for us, seeing all these old people.''
</P>
<P>
   They decided not to move until they absolutely had to _ but soon
they reconsidered. Looking at themselves more closely, he wrote,
``we began to see that we weren't that far away from being those
old people whose presence upset us.'' In June 1997 they moved to
the Mount.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, 18 residents the Gormans knew have died. ``There's a
sort of unspoken agreement among people who are here that mortality
is real, but nothing to worry about,'' said Gorman, who is
president of the assisted-living residents council. ``You have to
consider that a part of living is deteriorating.''
</P>
<P>
   And now that he makes regular visits to the nursing home to
visit friends, including Mrs. Skoog, he says it no longer holds the
horror that it once did. ``We're all heading in that direction,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The death notices go up in the corridors every few days, it
seems. In the first week of November, four residents died. The
last, 91-year-old Mildred Burke, was the day's featured obituary in
The Seattle Times. Ms. Burke had helped develop smaller hearing
aids and voice boxes, had been a crack swimmer, sailor and skier,
and had volunteered her time to visit hundreds of people in nursing
homes before entering one herself.
</P>
<P>
   But death is not what people at the Mount fear most. For all the
fears that Americans have of nursing homes, like soldiers in battle
the aged fear a crippling disability more than death. They are way
past American society's illusion that youth is eternal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I going to be bedridden?'' said Vivian Grenfell, who hopes
her weekly sessions in a pool will help ward off that day. ``Is
that the next step?''
</P>
<P>
   Soren Dahl, 85, says he considers himself lucky to have landed
the bed by the window in Room 563. He has a spectacular view of
Puget Sound, downtown Seattle and, beyond, the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Dahl spends hours at the window, tracking the planes, the
ferries, the lights at night. He invites visitors to sit and watch
the world with him.
</P>
<P>
   How did he get the room with the view? The previous occupant,
Dahl said matter-of-factly, died.

IMPEACHMENT STANCE COULD DEFINE LIVINGSTON'S TENURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Ill.)  (Eds: See also IMPEACH-WHITEHOUSE) 
(mk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even before he assumes the speaker's chair in
January, Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., faces a decision that could
define his tenure as leader of the House and could alter the course
of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   He could go down in history as the man who let Bill Clinton off
the hook. Or he could be remembered as the man who allowed the
impeachment inquiry into Clinton to continue to consume the House
and overshadow any legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   With Newt Gingrich, the current speaker, on vacation, and House
Republicans eager to bid the Gingrich era adieu, the pressure is
building on Livingston to choose his course even before he is
officially elected speaker in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to end unless Livingston steps in here and
takes some kind of leadership role,'' said Laura Nichols, an aide
to Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the Democratic leader. That is also
what some Republicans are saying privately.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment inquiry has defied a tidy solution, barreling
down the track under its own steam even as the public and many on
Capitol Hill scream, ``Stop.'' Livingston himself says he wants it
over by the end of the year. Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of
the Judiciary Committee, has set the same target date. That leaves
the speaker-to-be, who has barely assembled a staff and a team of
advisers, just three workweeks to wrap it up.
</P>
<P>
   But how would he do it? Intervene? Publicly or privately?
Short-circuit the proceedings? Make a deal with the White House and
risk condemnation, as President Ford did for pardoning Richard
Nixon? Or let the ``process'' run its course _ and risk letting
partisanship run amok and being perceived as a weak and ineffective
caretaker?
</P>
<P>
   For the last several months, Capitol Hill has been divided into
two separate worlds. One was impeachment, which got all the
attention. The other was laughingly referred to as ``substance.''
As chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Livingston was
completely outside the impeachment loop, preoccupied with the 13
fiefdoms that oversee the distribution of every federal dollar, and
that this fall became an object of ridicule and horror for
producing a 4,000-page budget that was loaded with pork and that
ceded several items to the president.
</P>
<P>
   The budget was approved at the end of October, quickly followed
by the Nov. 3 elections and Gingrich's surprise resignation.
Livingston was nominated for speaker by his Republican colleagues
just last Wednesday. On Thursday, the Judiciary Committee held its
first impeachment hearings. On Friday, Livingston was still steeped
in the mechanics of his transition, sorting out committee
assignments and chairmanships.
</P>
<P>
   Even without an impeachment inquiry, Livingston has a lot to
think about. He must bring order to an already riven House in which
his party will have a majority of just six votes. Beyond that, he
must captain a leadership team that has been described as a
dysfunctional family. And he will be tested repeatedly by the
do-or-die conservatives from the class of 1994 for whom this may be
the last hurrah. Many are under six-year term limits, making the
coming Congress their last chance to take stands that may uphold
their principles but could undermine their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, Livingston has now been catapulted to the
command center of the still-not-dead impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston is a man who likes to leave himself room to maneuver.
He has strong opinions on some subjects and can express them
clamorously, but he can appear enigmatic on others. When his
committee and party were torn apart this fall, for example, by a
debate over whether to give more money to the International
Monetary Fund, he remained aloof.
</P>
<P>
   So it is with impeachment. ``Studied neutrality'' would be a
good description of his forced utterances on the topic. ``If the
Judiciary Committee proves or charges that there is wrongdoing, we
will look at the evidence,'' he said recently. ``I have never
judged this case.''
</P>
<P>
   He has acknowledged that the public does not want the president
impeached and wants the inquiry over. But, as a former federal
prosecutor, he has indicated that the president should be punished
if he committed crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston has generally refrained from moralizing about the
president, providing a sharp contrast to Gingrich, who at one point
said Republicans should condemn the president's conduct in every
speech and who poured millions of dollars into reviving the matter
in commercials just before Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   But a week ago, Livingston did convey some outrage about
Clinton. ``The president of the United States has a responsibility
to the American people to live by the laws, to obey the laws,'' he
said on the Don Imus radio program. ``And if it's proven that he
did not, he's either going to have to be dealt with or he should
voluntarily recognize that he's got a problem. So far, I haven't
heard any singular recognition of his problem. So we'll just have
to let the processes move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Livingston seems uncertain, so do those who have toiled
away inside the world of impeachment. ``Consider the real
possibility,'' one top Republican adviser said, ``that they just
don't know what to do.''

YOUTHS AIM TO CREATE ONLINE COUNTRY

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Never has the good old Model United Nations,
popular for so long among the earnest high school set, seemed so
pallid, so retro, so (to be read with teen-age disdain) 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, 100 youngsters from 10 to 16 years old from around
the world attended a global forum at the Media Laboratory at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The forum, called the Junior
Summit, is to the quaint old Mock United Nations what a personal
computer is to an abacus.
</P>
<P>
   Connected online for months before they arrived for the summit,
equipped with pagers with e-mail functions and Power Point
presentation skills, the participants in the summit did not jabber
about treaties and points of order. They simply plotted to change
the world, using technology.
</P>
<P>
   They planned to create an online country, to be known as
Nation1, where anyone under 19 could automatically become a
citizen. Adults would need a visa, or special permission, to enter.
They hashed out the idea for Kidz Bank, an online bank for
children's savings that could lend them money for worthwhile
projects, and how to develop a digital currency. And they founded
an online global newspaper for children.
</P>
<P>
   They did not shoot low.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the year 2000, our global network shall comprise around 2
million people,'' Steven James Sutton, a 15-year-old from New
Zealand, announced in ringing Churchillian tones on Friday as he
rehearsed for a presentation before a gathering of diplomats, World
Bank officials, corporate sponsors and assorted dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have a network of school groups all across the
world,'' Sutton declared. ``We will have international events. We
will have everyone planting trees on Earth Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Adults tempted to shake their heads in amusement and joke about
the days when 30 years was the cut-off point for people who could
be trusted, instead of 19, might do well to note: These children
are backed by almost unlimited computer power from MIT, as well as
millions of dollars from a Japanese magnate.
</P>
<P>
   Isao Okawa, chairman of CSK Corp., which makes business
software, and Sega Enterprises Ltd., the game-maker, has agreed to
contribute $27 million to build a ``Center for Future Children''
next door to the current Media Lab building.
</P>
<P>
   The donation, MIT said, is one of the largest the university has
received and is believed to be the biggest ever made by a Japanese
individual to a foreign institution.
</P>
<P>
   It means a major expansion for the Media Lab, already known for
its success in winning corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   The lab's projects tend to focus on the intersection between
technology and people, and range from wearable computers to
electronic books.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Okawa was attending a meeting of the Group of Seven
industrialized countries when it struck him that though children
have the biggest stake in the future, they have almost no say in
determining it, said Mitchel Resnick, the Media Lab professor who
is overseeing development of the center's programs.
</P>
<P>
   The center will try ``to rethink how children live, learn and
play,'' Resnick said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We want to rethink technology to make it worthy of
children of the future. The kids you see here today could do so
much more technologically if we gave them the right tools.''
</P>
<P>
   And with those tools, the thinking goes, childhood itself would
change, as children became ever more able to take on new roles. For
example, becoming founders of banks and newspapers _ and nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether it's a pipe-dream or not, but I think
we're going to do this,'' said John Perry Barlow, co-founder of the
Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates freedom on the
Internet, and adviser to the group of youths working on the Nation1
project. ``I've never started a nation before, especially in three
days.''
</P>
<P>
   But the children have begun to show, he said, ``how they can
start assembling, marshaling and deploying resources in a way that
I think will scare the hell out of adults.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, most of the youngsters' plans would gladden adults'
hearts: reducing child labor, improving the environment, helping
disabled children and simplifying computing. Now, will adults
listen?
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be those who say, `That's cute, nice to hear your
voice,' and go back to what they're doing,'' said Terah DeJong, 15,
of India. But some at the global forum formed fast friendships, he
said, ``and we expect to continue on for years.''

GERARD GRISEY, 52, COMPOSER AND PIONEER IN `SPECTRAL MUSIC'
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (jw) 
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gerard Grisey, one of the most important French composers of the
generation after Pierre Boulez, died Wednesday in a Paris hospital.
He was 52.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke, the French consulate said.
</P>
<P>
   Grisey was born in Belfort, France, and studied from 1963 to
1965 at the music high school in Trossingen, Germany. He then
entered the Paris Conservatory, where he was a member of Olivier
Messiaen's class from 1968 to 1972. He also had lessons with Henri
Dutilleux in 1968, began work on electroacoustics with Jean-Etienne
Marie in 1969, and in 1972 attended the Darmstadt summer school,
where Karlheinz Stockhausen, Gyorgy Ligeti and Iannis Xenakis gave
courses. As a winner of the Rome Prize, he spent the next two years
in the Italian capital.
</P>
<P>
   Among his fellow students in Messiaen's class were Michael
Levinas and Tristan Murail, and the three composers remained close.
Together they formed the group L'Itineraire in 1976 and pioneered
what they called ``spectral music.'' In Grisey's case, the result
was often a gradual, probing search through the resonances of an
actual or imaginary sound, a kind of echo chamber music, profiting
from his further studies in acoustics with Emile Leip at the
Faculty of Sciences in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see sounds,'' he said, ``as beams of force oriented in time,
infinitely mobile and fluctuating.'' Metaphors of darkness and
light became important to his music, notably in two works for
ensemble and electronics: ``Modulations'' (1976-77), which Boulez
took up and recorded, and ``Jour Contre-Jour'' (1978-79).
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, he became one of the first composers to work at Boulez'
research institute in Paris, Ircam, where he produced ``Les Chants
de l'Amour'' for 12 voices and electronics (1982-84). A West German
government scholarship took him to Berlin in 1981, and he taught at
the University of California at Berkeley from 1982 to 1986. There
he completed the concert-length cycle, ``Les Espaces Acoustiques,''
whose forces grow from a solo viola in ``Prologue'' (1974) to full
orchestra with four solo horns in ``Epilogue'' (1985).
``Modulations'' is part of the process.
</P>
<P>
   Two CDs of his music have appeared on the Accord label.  &QL;

COMMENTARY: A CHERISHED RIGHT _ UNFETTERED HOLIDAY LIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEDMINSTER, N.J. _ This normally genteel township had a people's
revolution the other day.
</P>
<P>
   All right, the uprising did not have the epic sweep of the 1917
storming of the Czar's Winter Palace. The grievance, after all, was
comparatively trivial: a proposed ordinance that would bar
residents from displaying holiday lights more than 30 days before a
holiday and 20 days afterward, with violators facing 15 days in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   But such trivial issues are big deals in small towns. In a place
where lots of people are on a first-name basis with their elected
leaders, people did not want the five township committeemen telling
them when they could showcase their cherished Christmas lights,
blinking shamrocks or incandescent menorahs, particularly because
no one could remember a single fuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``People move out of the city and into suburban areas to get
away from the everyday hassles of regulation and foolishness,''
said Bob Merriam, a 30-year resident.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Johnson, who as the Township Committee's lone dissident
became the uprising's Lenin, said the ordinance addressed ``a
nonexistent problem'' while treading on freedom of speech and
religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people get elected to public office, they get the feeling
that they have been endowed with the wisdom of Solomon,'' he said.
``They adopt an attitude that, we know what's best for you. It's a
disease of all politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   It was feelings like these that explained why last week's
meeting of the Township Committee _ typically a soporific affair
that draws a half-dozen spectators _ was raucous and overflowing
with 100 Bedminsterites. Johnson's grown children, Kathleen and
Christopher, arrived with strings of Christmas lights laced over
their bodies. Henry Engelbrecht, 73, challenged Committeeman Norman
Lapidus to step outside and settle the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The rhetoric was not the kind usually heard in a township known
for well-bred rich families, including the Forbeses, the Dillons,
and the Frelinghuysens. When advocates argued that the law was
really designed to allow holiday lights _ since anything not
explicitly permitted was implicitly prohibited _ opponents minced
no words in calling the reasoning plain silly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say I want to pick my nose,'' Merriam said. ``Because
there's no law saying I can, it's illegal? I'm going to pick my
nose whenever I want to, and I'm going to put lights on my house
whenever I want to.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd's hostility was so intimidating that the four
committeemen who had seen some merit in the ordinance fell over
each other to kill it. Residents will be able to put up Christmas
lights any time they want.
</P>
<P>
   Bedminster is mostly horse country, a gently rolling landscape
whose families have been known to stable their horses in
brass-fitted stalls more elegant than some hotel rooms. But it is
also a township that has felt the heavy hand of government.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the so-called Mount Laurel court rulings intended
to increase low- and moderate-income housing in New Jersey's
suburbs, the township has seen its population triple to 8,400 in
less than a generation _ with most of the parvenus packed
cheek-by-jowl in a warren of condos and town houses known as The
Hills. Overnight, residents have had to wrestle with inadequate
schools and roadways.
</P>
<P>
   That's partly why those regrouping after the lighting victory
are bracing to pounce on even trifling examples of government
overreaching, like another proposed ordinance that would restrict
the height of grass on homeowners' lawns to eight inches.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Don Cross, a burly relative newcomer to town, favored
consideration of the holiday-lights ordinance. He calls opponents
of the measure elitists, curmudgeons, obstructionists and
``nasties,'' flavoring his epithets with a Texas twang that no
doubt helped him land the part of Richard Widmark's double in a
1961 John Ford western. He cautions that there could be disputes
among neighbors over extravagant displays.
</P>
<P>
   But sound reasoning, he said, was lost in the frenzy of revolt.
Now, he laments, his diligent administration will ``be remembered
for a stupid ordinance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We make mistakes,'' he conceded. ``That's why there are
erasers.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: TRYING TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF REVENGE IN
BOSNIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TINA ROSENBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yugoslavia, it has been said, always produced more history than
it could consume. Bosnia today has not one history of the recent
war, but one each for Muslims, Croats and Serbs, all contradictory.
The division of memory along ethnic fault lines has produced a
cycle of killing and revenge in the Balkans for more than a
thousand years.
</P>
<P>
   To try to break the cycle, some citizens' groups in Bosnia are
proposing a commission to write a common history. The goal may be
elusive, but is well worth a try. The idea shows how more and more
nations emerging from tyranny or war are designing independent
groups, commonly known as truth commissions, to examine the causes
and tell the full story of past crimes. But each country is
adapting the idea to its own circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The Bosnian war has strengthened each ethnic group's sense of
victimization. Many Serbs fervently believe only Serbs suffered,
and if they acknowledge that Serbs killed, argue self-defense. Some
Serbian war criminals are revered as heroes.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of many Muslims and Croats. Because Bosnia's
schools and media reinforce these nationalist myths, the children
who are absorbing them will be tinder someday when a demagogue like
Slobodan Milosevic comes along to incite them to kill rather than
be victimized again.
</P>
<P>
   The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia,
based in The Hague, was supposed to dampen these myths by
personalizing guilt in individuals rather than whole ethnic groups,
and prosecuting accused criminals of all ethnicities (although most
are Serbs, who committed the vast majority of Bosnia's atrocities).
</P>
<P>
   But the tribunal can do little for this cause. It is far away,
run by outsiders and has not been able to get NATO to capture the
top criminals. People in Bosnia learn of its activities mainly
through their propaganda-filled media. It has been easy for Serbs
to dismiss the tribunal as anti-Serb.
</P>
<P>
   All over the world, countries recovering from tyranny or war are
finding that justice, while crucial, can play only a limited role
in healing.
</P>
<P>
   In Latin America, for example, the new democracies and their
judicial systems were too weak to combat amnesties the militaries
issued themselves. So they formed truth commissions as consolation
prizes _ if they could not attain justice, the commissions could at
least officially acknowledge the victims' suffering and help them
discover what happened in the secret torture chambers and killing
fields.
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa, where the new government felt less threatened
by the old, the truth commission was able to offer amnesty to those
who confessed their roles in political crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia would need a different type of body, which should
probably be called a historical commission since the concept of
truth is so politicized. It would complement the Hague tribunal by
allowing the Bosnians themselves to try to write a common account
of the war, embracing the suffering of all sides.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of citizens' groups, small political parties and the
media are backing the idea, which was first set forth in a side
agreement to the Dayton peace accords. Indeed, some Serbs have said
that a post-World War II truth commission might have helped prevent
the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   Even leaders from all three groups have indicated support _
perhaps because each is sure his group's version of history will be
vindicated. The strongest reservations, ironically, come from the
Hague tribunal, whose members fear that witnesses might choose to
tell their stories to the commission rather than the tribunal. This
is a reasonable fear, but the commission could be structured so
that the Hague tribunal takes precedence.
</P>
<P>
   A draft proposal written by the U.S. Institute of Peace suggests
that the commission include Bosnians from all ethnicities, selected
by an international board after public consultation in Bosnia and
approved by Bosnia's collective presidency. The commission's
chairperson would be a foreigner. Since the tribunal and domestic
war-crime prosecutions exist, it would not be necessary to identify
perpetrators by name.
</P>
<P>
   The very pathologies the commission would be trying to cure
could keep it from doing its job. The commissioners themselves
could divide along ethnic lines. Hard-liners could try to
intimidate witnesses, manipulate the commission or reject the
report. But support for the idea among Bosnians of all ethnicities
is a sign that it has a chance.

   NEW YORK _ The closing of the Concord Resort Hotel leaves only a
handful of the famous Catskills resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the acknowledged queen of the hotels,
Grossinger's, closed after steadily declining for years, said John
Conway, an expert on Sullivan County history. So did the Pines,
which was in South Fallsburg and, like many of the hotels, became
prominent in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Other names from the past have been closed for much longer. The
Flagler closed in the early 1970s and is now the Crystal Run School
for developmentally disabled children. Four hotels _ the Brickman,
the Windsor, the Gilberts and the Nemerson _ have also been closed
since the early 1970s and are now part of a collection of private
religious centers operated by the followers of an Indian guru,
Conway said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stevensville closed in the early 1980s, Conway said. But its
new owners plan to reopen it in early 1999 as the Swan Lake Golf
and Tennis Resort Center, said Jonathan Drapkin, the Sullivan
County manager. It will join Kutsher's _ whose patriarch, Milton
Kutsher, died last week _ and the Raleigh as the only vestiges of
the region's storied past.

What's the truth about Daryl Hannah? 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I saw a special on Daryl Hannah that said something was wrong
with one of her hands. My husband swears otherwise. Who was right?
Say me, me, me. _ D.M., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Hannah has a shortened fingertip on one hand. Her publicist,
Alan Nierob, denied a recent report by Jeannette Walls of MSNBC
that the actress wears a prosthetic for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something you would notice,'' Nierob said. ``I think
that it's a congenital condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Walls reported on Nov. 9 that the prosthetic came off on the set
of the ABC movie ``Rear Window'' and production stopped until it
could be located.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah, who turns 38 on Dec. 3, is currently filming
``Diplomatic Siege'' in Romania with Peter Weller and director
Gustavo Graef Marino. Fans can write to her in care of Chuck
Binder, 1465 Linda Crest Drive, Beverly Hills, Calif. 90210.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was in the Navy with Lance LeGault. Lately he has been the
narrator of a few TNN productions and had roles on ``Magnum P.I.''
and ``The A-Team.'' How can I write to him? _ R.G., via the
Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to LeGault in care of the Tisherman Agency, 6767 Forest
Lawn Drive, Suite 101, Los Angeles, Calif. 90068.
</P>
<P>
   LeGault, a one-time movie stand-in for Elvis Presley, has
appeared on more than 50 films and TV shows. He most recently
portrayed ``Elder God of Fire'' on the film ``Mortal Kombat:
Annihilation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop the Movement,'' a collection of country songs by LeGault,
is available by mail order to Shock Records, 16105-8H Victory
Blvd., Suite 382, Van Nuys, Calif. 91406. The price is $10 plus $2
shipping and handling, and checks should be payable to ``Lance
LeGault Inc.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did the term ``hard-wired'' come into use? _ R.J.,
Houston
</P>
<P>
   A: The term was coined in the late 1960s, shortly after
``hardware'' and ``software'' were adopted as references to
computer technology.
</P>
<P>
   Hardware dates back to the 16th century as a way to describe the
mechanical equipment required to perform an activity.
``Hard-wired'' originally referred to an element of an electronic
circuit that was determined by the wiring and could not be changed,
according to the Free On-Line Dictionary of Computing.
</P>
<P>
   It has been extended to refer to ``anything that is not
modifiable.'' The On-Line Dictionary is available on the World Wide
Web at nightflight.com/foldoc.  &QL;

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What were the original NFL teams? _ A.R., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: In 1920, a group of independent pro football teams formed the
American Professional Football Association, which was renamed the
National Football League two years later.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Professional Football Researchers Association,
the charter teams were the Akron Pros, Buffalo All-Americans,
Canton Bulldogs, Chicago Cardinals, Chicago Tigers, Cleveland
Tigers, Columbus Panhandles, Dayton Triangles, Decatur Staleys,
Detroit Heralds, Hammond Pros, Muncie Flyers, Rochester Jeffersons
and Rock Island Independents.
</P>
<P>
   All of these teams were defunct by 1930, except for two Illinois
teams, the Cardinals and Staleys. Today, they are the Arizona
Cardinals and the Chicago Bears. The Green Bay Packers joined in
1921.

</P>
<P>
   Q: I know the meaning, but what does ``cut to the chase'' refer
to? _ N.C.F., Plano
</P>
<P>
   A: The expression is a reference to a director or screenwriter's
instruction in a movie _ ``cut to the chase scene.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cut to the chase'' was used in moviemaking as early as 1929,
when a filmmaker wanted the story to progress immediately to a
pursuit, Jesse Sheidlower, a Random House editor, writes on his Web
site. ``The figurative use, which is now quite common, is fairly
recent; it seems to date only from the early 1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheidlower publishes Jesse's Word of the Day at

<P>
   Q: Where can I write to the author Jerry Pournelle? _ M.D., Fort
Myers, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Pournelle at 12358 Ventura Blvd., Box 372, Studio
City, CA 91604.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the science fiction author and technical writer released
the young-adult novel ``Starswarm.'' Although his longtime role as
a ``Byte'' magazine columnist ended this year when the publication
folded, Pournelle continues to write for the foreign editions of
the magazine.

FOR CITY UNIONS, A THANKSGIVING BOUNTY TURNS BURDEN

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Distributing turkeys to union members has been a
holiday tradition at District Council 37 for more than a decade. In
some years, frozen turkeys were packed to the ceiling at the
council's headquarters while 1,000 or more union members lined up
to receive their bounty.
</P>
<P>
   The tradition delighted members of the council, the umbrella
group representing 120,000 New York City municipal workers, and it
benefited union leaders politically.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of members liked the idea of getting turkeys, and they
liked the social aspect of meeting friends when they went to pick
up the turkeys,'' said Gary Goff, a computer programmer.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, a gesture of generosity at Thanksgiving turned
into evidence of corruption, as Joseph DeCanio, president of the
local that represents highway workers, pleaded guilty to
embezzlement. DeCanio admitted skimming more than $50,000, over
four years, as he bought and sold turkeys for distribution to
municipal workers in another local.
</P>
<P>
   And it did not end there. The office of the Manhattan district
attorney, Robert Morgenthau, which had been tipped off to possible
impropriety in the Thanksgiving giveaway by local members, is
expanding its inquiry at the district council to cover the sales of
all turkeys bought and distributed, and is investigating
allegations of vote fraud, falsified records and kickbacks from
travel agencies and caterers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all started with turkeys, and it's ending with turkeys,''
said Mark Rosenthal, the new president of the local representing
motor-vehicle operators.
</P>
<P>
   Union records show that DeCanio's turkey business was not
limited to the transactions referred to in his guilty plea.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his own local, DeCanio has sold turkeys to
several others, including the local representing 2,800 motor
vehicle operators, a local for 2,350 data-processing workers, a
local for 1,570 custodial workers the local representing crossing
guards and cafeteria aides, according to records and labor leaders
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   DeCanio charged some local presidents more than $40 each for
20-pound turkeys he bought for about $18, union records show. In
some years, union leaders said, DeCanio helped furnish 22,000
turkeys to about half a dozen of the 56 union locals in the
district council.
</P>
<P>
   While the turkey giving pleased union members and leaders alike,
officials from the district council's parent union, the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said there was
another downside: The large sums spent on turkeys pushed some
locals deeper into debt and underscored the lack of financial
controls among the locals.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Local 372, the local representing 25,000 crossing
guards and school cafeteria workers spent $275,000 for about 8,000
turkeys last year _ a year in which the local's debt soared from $5
million to almost $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very excessive,'' said Lee Saunders, who was appointed
trustee of that local because of financial mismanagement there.
``It shouldn't have happened. There weren't a hell of a lot of
financial controls within the union''
</P>
<P>
   And, Saunders said, fewer than half the turkeys were given to
members of Local 372; most of them were donated to churches and
charities.
</P>
<P>
   The local's former president, Charles Hughes, gave turkeys to
Parkchester Baptist Church in the Bronx, Trinity Temple Baptist
Church in Brooklyn and at least one church in Millen, Ga., where he
had a second home.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said that Hughes gave out hundreds of turkeys in
Georgia. One year, said the officials, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, there was a mini-riot in Millen when the people who
showed up for turkeys far exceeded the number available.
</P>
<P>
   A union judicial panel expelled Hughes last June after finding
that he had embezzled more than $1.7 million from the local through
schemes such as taking fraudulent overtime and having the union pay
his personal credit-card bills.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Shargel, a lawyer for Hughes, lauded the turkey donations
and said Hughes he was not guilty of any crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlies Hughes has had a long history of tremendous efforts
on behalf of disadvantaged people,'' Shargel said. ``He has not
only fed the hungry and done acts of charity and kindness all over
the country, indeed all over the world. It is absolutely appalling
that now the very acts that he was praised for many years are now a
subject of condemnation.''
</P>
<P>
   The tradition of giving turkeys to union members at Thanksgiving
goes back to at least 1985, when Victor Gotbaum was the council's
executive director. It was overseen by Vincent Parisi, who
government investigators say had ties to organized crime and was
then president of the highway laborers local. DeCanio became
president of the highway laborers local in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   DeCanio, in pleading guilty on Friday, said that, acting as a
middle man, he gave Bessie Jamison, the president of a local
representing 1,800 Board of Education clerical workers, an
improperly inflated invoice for the turkeys she bought. DeCanio
said he then shared the inflated amount with her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jamison did not return phone calls to her office.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference after DeCanio pleaded guilty, prosecutors
said he improperly increased turkey prices by about 20 cents a
pound, normally raising them to $1.10 a pound from 90 cents. This
meant that a 20-pound turkey was priced at $22 rather than $18.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   DeCanio bought his turkeys from Drohan Co. in Queens.
Prosecutors said there was no evidence that Drohan overcharged or
skimmed off money.
</P>
<P>
   But some union leaders who bought turkeys from DeCanio sometimes
demanded 60 cents to $1 a pound for themselves, union officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, according to the local's financial records, Robert
Taylor, who was then president of the local representing motor
vehicle operators, spent $11,000 for 250 turkeys _ $44 per turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was outrageous, especially because Taylor left a big debt
for us,'' said Walter Drummonds, a member of the local.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the motor-vehicle operators local said that
as soon as they learned last year that Taylor had paid $44 for
turkeys, they grew convinced he was skimming off money and they
complained to Stanley Hill, the council's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where'd he get the turkeys from, Peru?'' one of the members
asked at the meeting with Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes union officials let their friends take more then one
turkey, officials said. Edward Blassingame, an urban park ranger,
said: ``They used to bring a truck over, and you'd see some people
leaving with two, three, four turkeys, while they'd be telling
other people, `Sorry, we've run out of turkeys.' It wasn't right.''
</P>
<P>
   Many union members also complained that their leaders played
favorites in distributing turkeys. Rosenthal, who defeated Taylor
this year in a race for the local's presidency, said his
predecessor held raffles to give 250 turkeys to the 400 members who
showed up. Most members got one raffle ticket, Rosenthal said,
Taylor's friends got 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some members of the executive board would take cases of
turkeys home for themselves,'' Rosenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's telephone number is unlisted, and district council
officials said he was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   This year, to remove suspicions about the turkey-giving process,
Rosenthal's local gave its members $20 vouchers to buy turkeys at
Pathmark. Each member, he said, had to show identification before
obtaining a voucher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be able to show accountability to my members where
the money went,'' Rosenthal said. ``I wanted to make sure no one
from my executive board or anyone took more than one.''
</P>
<P>
   Saunders, the trustee of the crossing guards local, did the same
thing, substituting vouchers for turkeys. This year, he paid
$48,000 for 2,400 vouchers, down from the $275,000 that the local's
ousted president, Hughes, spent last year on turkeys.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders questioned the propriety of spending so much of the
local's money on turkeys for charities in the past when the local
was so deeply in debt and many of its members live below the
poverty line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the importance of community relations and church
relations, but it was excessive,'' Saunders said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Crilly, who recently retired as president of the data
processors local, said in a series of interviews that in past years
he bought 1,600 turkeys from DeCanio, often paying about $36,000,
but last year paying $27,000 after he demanded a lower price.
</P>
<P>
   Crilly said he expected to be indicted for his role in the
purchases, although he insisted he had never taken any kickbacks.
He said that when he bought turkeys, he gave DeCanio two checks,
one for the wholesaler and one for about $5,000 made out to
DeCanio. In a telephone interview several weeks ago, DeCanio denied
Crilly's account and called him ``a chronic liar.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Enveloped in the faint sweetness of incense and their
own hypnotic singing, eight Buddhist nuns and their abbesses from
the cloistered imperial convents in Japan on Saturday transplanted
a medieval ceremony of veneration for the first female Zen master
to St. Paul's Chapel at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony, attended by about 200 people who maintained an
awestruck silence for nearly two hours, signified an international
coup for the university and its Institute for Medieval Japanese
Studies, the only institute of its kind in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the nuns had never been outside Japan. For all, it was
their first visit to the United States. And neither their ordinary
monastic ceremonies nor the solemn ritual of song and poetic
offerings to Abbess Mugai Nyodai, a spiritual leader dead for 700
years, had been seen by the general public before.
</P>
<P>
   Abbess Nyodai, a women of noble birth who was taught by a
Chinese Zen master, founded the first Buddhist convent in Japan in
the early 13th century and is considered not only the first female
master of the meditative discipline but also an instrumental figure
in spreading Zen Buddhism to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``She belongs to all of us,'' said Barbara Ruch, the director of
the institute and the first scholar in the world to have been
admitted into one of the secluded Buddhist convents in Japan to
conduct research on Abbess Nyodai and the little-known role of
women in the nurturing of Zen in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promise you, you will never forget her,'' Ms. Ruch added, as
an introduction to the ceremony. ``She has the ability to empower
you and I urge you to let her empower you one on one.''
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the ceremony was a replica of a life-sized
cypress wood statue of the seated abbess, on loan from the Kanagawa
Prefectural Kanazawa Bunko Museum, along with scrolls, documents
and imperial court objects sent by various Japanese collections.
</P>
<P>
   The original statue is believed to date from the last years of
Abbess Nyodai's life, when she was in her 70s; it is kept at one of
the convents in Japan. The statue portrays a solid woman, her head
shaved and her lined face set in an expression of serene but almost
glum meditation. The replica, the only one in existence, will
remain on exhibit at the university along with the other monastic
objects until Dec. 4.
</P>
<P>
   The nuns, their heads shaved and their layers of silk robes
shining as luminously as a Japanese watercolor, shuffled gravely
through a series of rituals _ lighting candles, offering incense,
walking in a circle before the statue of Abbess Nyodai and gently
tossing hand-cut paper petals in homage.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony also mixed western traditions with the Buddhist.
Members of the Collegium Musicum sang a choral tribute to a
medieval German Catholic abbess, Hildegard von Bingen, and the Very
Rev. James Parks Morton, director of the Interfaith Center of New
York, led a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to be a very international university,'' said Suzanne
Trimel, a spokeswoman for Columbia University. ``Here we are in St.
Paul's chapel, which was originally Christian, and now we have this
wonderful Buddhist ceremony.''

YALE BEATS HARVARD, 9-7 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM N. WALLACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ A 27-yard field goal by Mike Murawczyk gave
an outplayed Yale team a 9-7 victory over Harvard Saturday. The
field goal came after Yale's Jeff Hockenbrock recovered a fumble by
Rich Linden on the Crimson 15-yard line with 3 minutes 4 seconds
left to play. Linden had been hit hard by Ben Blake while running
for a first down.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs finished with a 6-4 record, 5-2 in the Ivy League,
while Harvard is 4-6, 3-4.
</P>
<P>
   Yale did not score until just 5:33 remained in the game, on a
9-yard pass from Joe Walland to Derek Bentley. The extra-point
attempt failed, and Harvard still led by 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   The game's first score came in the 10th minute of the third
quarter, capping a 71-yard Harvard drive. Linden, the Crimson
quarterback, pushed ahead for the goal on third down from the
six-inch line and just made the end zone. Then Mike Giampaolo
kicked the extra point for a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The key plays in the drive were runs by the backup tailback
Damon Jones and a pass from Linden to tight end Chris Eitzmann that
went 16 yards to the Elis' two.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard on its next possession could not score from the Yale
two, and then the Crimson missed a short field goal on fourth down.
</P>
<P>
   The first half was scoreless, Harvard failing to exploit its few
scoring opportunities while Yale had none. After two periods the
Crimson had outgained the Bulldogs 188 yards to 63, with nine first
downs to three for Yale.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's defense deserved credit for holding down a Yale
offense that had averaged 386 yards per game and 21.9 points.
</P>
<P>
   An erratic and potent crosswind hampered passing and punting.
Deep passes were problematical while punts went anywhere from 19 to
53 yards. There were 13 punts in the first half, seven by Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Yale's appearance here as a favorite, after winning its last two
games, marked a swift recovery for the fortunes of the Bulldogs in
the Ivy League. Last season, and the one before, Yale had finished
last in the standings and had lost 13 straight league games as this
campaign began.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs' last winning season had come in 1991 and Yale had
not been in the championship picture since 1989. Last year's record
was 1-9, and it was 2-8 the year before that.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Siedlecki, the coach who came to Yale from Amherst last
year, was thus repeating his history. At both Amherst and Worcester
Tech before that, and now Yale, Siedlecki had quickly turned losing
programs into winning ones.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Harvard's season had fallen short of expectations.
Last year's Crimson squad swept through the Ivy League unbeaten and
this season 14 starters returned.
</P>
<P>
   But Harvard was stunned by Columbia, 24-0, in its opener and
then lost its next two games. A modest winning streak of three was
followed by two more defeats and a 3-3 Ivy mark. Both Harvard and
Yale had beaten Princeton this season, so this match was for the
mythical Big Three championship.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the season, Chris Menick, Harvard's star tailback who
gained 1,267 yards rushing as a sophomore last season for an
all-time school record, was injured, and a sprained left ankle kept
him out of two games. But Menick started Saturday against Yale.

DAVENPORT SHOWS GRAF HOW SHE GOT TO THE TOP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lately Steffi Graf, resplendent in her return from
September wrist surgery, had been the queen of mean on every tennis
court she touched, knocking off three of the world's top-ranked
players. She treated her victims, including No. 1 Lindsay
Davenport, as if they were little more than a bunch of pretenders
to her favorite throne. The 12th-ranked Graf seemed to have their
number, no matter what that number happened to be.
</P>
<P>
   But Graf's 12-match, two-tournament tear came to a crashing halt
at Madison Square Garden on Saturday when Davenport, anxious to
prove that her place at the head of the pecking order is no
accident, poured on the pressure in the final stages of their Chase
Championships semifinal and outworked the German, 6-1, 2-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   The match took one hour 37 minutes to resolve and turned on the
sixth game of the final set when Graf, who seized just five of the
14 break opportunities she was allotted, suffered an untimely
glitch in her killer instinct and let Davenport escape from a 0-40
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The victory moved the 22-year-old Davenport, who won her first
Grand Slam singles title two months ago at the U.S. Open and on
Saturday was named the WTA Tour's player of the year, into her
second finale here.
</P>
<P>
   She had not been to the title match since Gabriela Sabatini,
long since retired, defeated her in 1994. For Graf, the loss
spoiled her plan to end 1998 the way she had ended 1996 and four
other years on the circuit: as champion of her sport's world
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave it everything I had in the past three weeks, and that
was a lot; in the end, I guess it was a little too much,'' said
Graf, who felt her footwork deteriorated after pulling a muscle in
the back of her right thigh during that all-important sixth game.
``Sure, I'm disappointed. I knew I was really close, but I can only
look back with a positive attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Their contest began on a note of mutual hesitation. Davenport
dropped her first service game by blooping a nervous forehand
beyond the baseline, but Graf was just as indecisive when her turn
came to serve. And so, after two games, the opening set was knotted
at 1-1 and waiting for somebody to take charge.
</P>
<P>
   That person was Davenport, who has begun to admit that holding
down the No. 1 ranking comes with the responsibility to assert
oneself in all matches, especially the high-stakes ones.
</P>
<P>
   The Californian held with an ace for a 2-1 lead and went ahead
by 3-1 when Graf elbowed a backhand slice into the net at break
point. Graf's tentative returns gave Davenport an easy hold for
4-1, and after dismantling Graf's serve again for a 5-1 advantage,
Davenport grabbed the set, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Graf didn't let it go without putting up a little fight. On the
first set point, she clipped the corner with another sliced
backhand that Davenport, on the run, blocked back over the net and
out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Then a bold forehand pass elicited a netted backhand from
Davenport, ruining a second set point. But on the third set point,
the American went toe-to-toe with Graf in a battle of sharp-angled
forehands: Davenport's hugged the sideline; Graf's reply veered
wide.
</P>
<P>
   Graf has been around too long to be cowed by 6-1 deficits, so
she simply started the match over in her mind in the second set.
Fresh starts are something she has had to make a habit of over the
course of a 15-year career, in which surgery has required seven pit
stops, including the reconstructive knee surgery that caused her to
miss this event last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone who has done so well in their career, they don't just
disappear,'' Monica Seles said after Graf dismissed her in their
quarterfinal here.
</P>
<P>
   Seles said Graf and her notorious willpower are virtually
indestructible: ``She is still in better shape than most players,
so you always view her that way. In my mind it hasn't changed at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   What changed in the middle set of Saturday's semifinal was
Davenport's pinpoint accuracy: Suddenly it belonged to Graf, and
suddenly Davenport was feeling the burn of the blister on her left
foot every time Graf's shots tugged her from one side of the court
to the other.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport went down 4-2 when she overhit a crosscourt forehand
at break point of the sixth game, and after allowing Graf to hold
serve for a 5-2 lead, Davenport took an injury timeout to have her
blister sprayed with an analgesic and rewrapped.
</P>
<P>
   Deeming the second set a lost cause, Davenport played a weak
service game that gift-wrapped the set for Graf, 6-2, and left the
match in a state of stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   The third set was a showdown. First, Davenport broke Graf's
serve, but then the 29-year-old Graf, who had a blister of her own
burning its way through the sole of her left foot, broke right back
only to falter again in her service game. Down 0-40, Graf hung her
head and clapped her hands to her hips in frustration after
Davenport drilled a crisp and unreachable crosscourt backhand over
the net for a 2-1 edge.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was Graf's turn to do the receiving and the breaking,
and at 15-40, Davenport slapped a forehand into the net and match
was tied up at 2-2. Graf won the race to see who would manage to
hold serve first in the final set, and when she had ripped away the
forehand that gave her a 3-2 lead, a smile replaced the sneer that
had been plastered on her face since she walked onto court to the
strains of Springsteen's Hungry Heart.
</P>
<P>
   Hunger for more titles, in particular the sixth career
Championships victory that would let her end this comeback season
on a three-event unbeaten streak, would be a more appropriate
description of what drives Graf these days.
</P>
<P>
   She was incensed with herself for letting Davenport scramble out
of a 0-40 deficit to hold for 3-3, and the instant Davenport's
forehand winner ended that game, Graf hustled to the sidelines and
summoned a trainer to tape her right thigh.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after saving one break point with a brilliant forehand
down-the-line pass, Graf netted a forehand on Davenport's second
break opportunity, and the limping Californian took a 4-3 lead that
turned out to be pivotal when she backed it up with an ace at game
point of the next game for a 5-3 lead.

NEW URGENCY DISPLAYED IN NBA TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chris Dudley looked haggard, like a trader whose
stock was stuck on a roller coaster. While he managed to emerge
upbeat from a negotiating session late Friday night, he was like
most of his peers: He had no idea when he would be paid to play
basketball again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a house of cards right now,'' Dudley said. ``It looks
like we're moving in the right direction, but everything is so
conditional, it could fall apart at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the fear of losing the season motivated them or not,
players and owners displayed an urgency unseen in the National
Basketball Association's nearly five-month-old labor dispute. They
negotiated face to face for almost 10 hours, making compromises on
two key economic issues that may go a long way toward salvaging a
significantly shortened schedule.
</P>
<P>
   It was not only the longest bargaining session of the lockout,
now in its 144th day, but also the most productive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say our negotiating committee came in with our pajamas
and their negotiating committee came in with theirs too,'' NBA
Commissioner David Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   Participants on both sides of the meeting said each had moved at
least a couple of points off their requested numbers for total
revenue distribution. The owners wanted no more than 50 percent
paid out to player salaries, while the players wanted to make as
much as 60 percent of the income. It was unclear what the exact
figures were.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the owners have agreed to accept, with several conditions,
the framework of an escrow plan. The plan would be put in place in
the fourth through sixth years of a proposed seven-year agreement,
and would include players withholding a percentage of their
salaries at the beginning of the season.
</P>
<P>
   If an agreed-upon percentage were exceeded, then the fund would
be used to pay the owners back. The players had offered to withhold
as much as 10 percent of their annual salaries in those years.
</P>
<P>
   No further negotiations were scheduled for the weekend, but both
sides planned to resume bargaining before Thanksgiving. The league
and the union were also doubtful that a deal could be struck this
week, meaning the possibility of playing in 1998 is all but gone.
</P>
<P>
   If negotiations continued at the current pace, a more likely
scenario would be an agreement in principle by the first week of
December and perhaps starting the season the first week of January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very concerned, but I'm hopeful,'' Stern said Friday when
asked if he still feared losing the season to labor strife. ``It's
quite a hill that we have to climb. What we confirmed tonight is
that we've got two different views of the way we come at the these
issues. All I can tell you is, their highest and our lowest aren't
matching, and that means there's still a pretty good gap between
us. And that covers a lot of issues, and that's going to be a real
problem. But the best way we can deal with that is the way we're
dealing with it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the longest bargaining session since Oct. 28, when
Michael Jordan tried to broker a deal with Stern and other chief
negotiators until 1 a.m. Since then, the parties have engaged in
rhetoric and name-calling and done everything but make progress on
a new collective bargaining agreement.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But with genuine concerns over lost games and player salaries,
the two sides put away their animosity and began to work toward a
settlement on Friday. After players made the first move _ a change
to their escrow tax plan _ owners made a counterproposal that
included the change. The players then came back with yet another
offer.
</P>
<P>
   In the hallways between sessions, owners and players could be
seen talking congenially with each other. It was a stark contrast
to the last meeting at the same midtown Manhattan hotel three weeks
ago, when at least one owner and player engaged in a shouting match
during a give-and-take session.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, we can say we had a productive day,'' the
deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, said. ``We both realized that the
season is in jeopardy here and to find out if we can or cannot make
a deal.'''
</P>
<P>
   While there was sincere encouragement, the owners and the
players seemed to understand they had a long road ahead of them
before a deal could be struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides want to do something, but both sides have some
serious issues that they feel real strongly about,'' Dudley said.
``It's a frustrating process. I don't want to lose the season, but
we're getting closer and closer to that time. I'm happy with the
progress, but it's still definitely a concern.''

   NEW YORK _ With a deal reported to be near for the sale of the
New York Yankees, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, their No. 1 fan, was
uncharacteristically reticent Saturday about what that might mean
for the team and its possible move from the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees owner George Steinbrenner is close to an agreement to
sell a majority share in the team to Cablevision but with a proviso
keeping him in charge, several of his business associates have
said.
</P>
<P>
   With Steinbrenner's history of complaints about Yankee Stadium
and the threat of New Jersey's luring the team away, the mayor has
made the team's retention a top priority, even if that means
building a new ball park at city expense in midtown Manhattan. Such
a move is opposed by critics like City Council Speaker Peter
Vallone.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference a few blocks from Yankee Stadium, the mayor
did not deny the prospective deal, nor would he say anything about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That isn't for me to comment on,'' Giuliani said. ``That's a
private deal. It's a private organization. The Yankees, despite
some of the misconceptions among some of the politicians in this
city, are a private business, and whatever they do in terms of
sales is really their business.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how a sale might affect the Yankees' future, the mayor was
equally noncommittal. ``I have no idea,'' he said. ``It would
depend on who they sold it to, what their resources were. I mean,
we'll only know that if there is a sale of the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   And asked if an impending sale would expedite a decision on a
new stadium and site, the mayor only said, ``There's no way to know
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani did talk about a related issue: the recent decision
of the city's Economic Development Corp. to pay $3 million for
design studies for a new stadium in the Bronx or Manhattan, which
The New York Daily News reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, who has vowed to block a new stadium outside the Bronx,
attacked the design project.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's comments came as a limited partner in the Yankees
said that the potential sale was the central item on the agenda at
a partners' meeting on Thursday in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a very good lunch,'' said the partner, who spoke on
condition of anonymity because Steinbrenner had issued strict
orders not to talk to the press.
</P>
<P>
   A business associate of Steinbrenner's said that it was unlikely
he would decide on a future home for the Yankees in the Bronx,
Manhattan or New Jersey before the sale was completed, possibly
early next year.

BARRETT, ONE-TIME WINNER, WANTS MORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ When Tina Barrett was an LPGA rookie in 1989, she
won a tournament, and she took winning for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very, very green,'' said Barrett, now a 32-year-old tour
veteran. ``I thought when you played well, you won. That was really
the only week I played well. I won, so I thought that's how that
worked. I've since learned that it doesn't always happen like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Did she ever learn. Barrett has not won on the LPGA tour since
that victory, a nine-year drought that has been both
character-building and frustrating. Barrett's long quest for
victory, however, could be fulfilled this weekend at the Pagenet
Tour Championship, the season-ending event that is limited to the
year's top 30 money-winners and is one of the four major
tournaments in women's golf.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett entered play Saturday in second place (seven under par)
at the Desert Inn Golf Club, four strokes behind Laura Davies, the
leader at 11 under par (133). Karrie Webb, at five under, was in
third place.
</P>
<P>
   For Barrett, winning a prestigious tournament after such a long
wait would make the accomplishment even more gratifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of feel like I'm due,'' said Barrett, who came close
two weeks ago when she lost on the third hole of a sudden-death
playoff to Hiromi Kobayashi in the Japan Classic. ``I am so much
better than I was in 1989. I have experience, I hit the ball
better, I'm a better putter, I'm a better chipper. But I know how
hard it is to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to be naive,'' she added. ``But I've had
situations where I've played well and not won. I've had situations
where I've kind of choked. I've had other situations where someone
just played better. I just have to keep plugging along.''
</P>
<P>
   At least by finishing among the top 30 money winners each year
since 1996, Barrett has put herself into position to win the
championship for three straight years.
</P>
<P>
   Not a long hitter at 5 feet 4 1/2 inches, Barrett relies on her
accuracy and putting. Davies is the LPGA's longest hitter, capable
of drives in the 300-yard range. Barrett knew that on many holes,
Davies would outdrive her by 50 yards or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said I'm going to be reincarnated as a long hitter,''
Barrett said. ``But you can't do anything about it. I have to play
the way I play.''
</P>
<P>
   If Barrett were to win this weekend, ending her long drought
might give her the confidence to reach even greater heights. On
Thursday, Davies lamented her 24th-place standing on the money
list, saying she was used to being ranked higher. Barrett would
like to have that kind of assurance herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I aspire to be at that level,'' she said. ``But 20th on the
money list is a good year. There's an A level and an A-plus level,
and Laura really is in the A-plus category. I haven't been there
yet. I don't have the length, but then you have someone like Rosie
Jones, who has made a whole bunch of Solheim Cup teams, and she
hits it like I do. But it seems like the top of our tour has a
little bit better ball strikers, and they hit it just a little bit
farther.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies used her power to build her lead at the halfway point,
shooting 11 under par (three eagles, five birdies) on the par-5
holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long hitters will tell you that our courses are too
short,'' Barrett said on Friday. ``I could see it today. Karrie was
hitting wedges into some holes when I was hitting 6-irons. I don't
complain when the courses are too long, but a lot of the long
hitters complain when the courses are too short. A lot of them
might think this course is too short. I don't think it is. But it
seems like on the men's tour, the par 5's are reachable in two
shots by 85 percent of the players, while here it might be 50
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett, though, did not care how far Davies might hit the ball
this weekend, as long as Barrett wins the first-place check of
$215,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've improved my season tremendously in the last few weeks,''
she said. ``Before that, I was 40th on the money list and playing
OK. But I've made a mediocre season a lot better.''

EARTH TO KOVALEV: WE ARE STILL WAITING  
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Now that Aleksei Kovalev is flying airplanes
in his spare time, he is approaching literally what his hockey
style has always suggested in the figurative sense: that he is a
space cadet, a daredevil Russian cosmonaut, drafted on the first
round from Dynamo Moscow in June 1991.
</P>
<P>
   When Kovalev plays the way he did in the first two games of the
New York Rangers road trip last week, there is only one question to
ask: Who are the other candidates for the Hart Trophy as most
valuable player in the National Hockey League? Unfortunately,
Kovalev does not always play with the strength, skill and
determination he showed in scoring two goals and assisting on
another over two games on Wednesday and Thursday nights, a 3-1
defeat in Anaheim and a 5-1 victory in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   When Kovalev flies at lower altitudes and with lesser attitude,
the questions are the same as they have been in his seven _ yes,
seven! _ seasons in the NHL: Will Kovalev ever mature into the
all-star that his skills promise? Will the Rangers tire of his
baffling inconsistency and trade him?
</P>
<P>
   Only 25 years old, the flashy right wing is at the cusp between
``prospect'' and ``suspect.'' Although he has scored 20 or more
goals in four seasons, he has yet to launch his career to the star
level. Earth to Alex: On this mediocre but hard-working team that
is searching for a virtuoso performer, this could be your year. Do
you read me? Over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make plays, control the game,'' Kovalev said, referring to his
objectives. ``Everything comes through hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   His hard work was most evident not on goals but on shifts that
forced opposing players to take penalties. Kovalev is so strong, so
tricky, so determined that Ducks and Kings were hooking, holding
and tripping him when he would bull wide, hard and fast around
them. He forced at least six of these fouls, creating manpower
advantages for his side. It is the sort of thing that Mario Lemieux
used to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I think before the game: I've got to draw four
or five penalties,'' Kovalev said. ``It just happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad things happen, too. At Anaheim, with Kovalev working the
right point on the power play, he and Brian Leetch tried a
high-risk/high-reward play. Leetch, the left point man, dashed down
the right side, near the boards. Kovalev, unlike the defenseman
Leetch, is a forward, not as accustomed to playing on the blue
line. Instead of safely flipping the puck deep into the corner for
Leetch to chase, Kovalev tried to finesse a pretty pass to Leetch's
stick.
</P>
<P>
   Ranger fans, and several former Ranger coaches, can guess what
happened next. With the rear door unguarded, the puck was
intercepted by Steve Rucchin of the Ducks, who raced in to score on
a breakaway. But what happened after that was new and different.
</P>
<P>
   During the previous four seasons, under coach Colin Campbell,
Kovalev would have been benched and punished, perhaps for the rest
of the game. Coach John Muckler, who replaced Campbell last
February, sent Kovalev right back on the ice for the next shift.
Kovalev responded by creating a play and assisting on Niklas
Sundstrom's tying goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really happy I don't have that hard time anymore, where
you made a mistake and you get benched,'' Kovalev said. ``You come
back and you still have a chance to make a nice play and maybe
score a goal. That's the way to be. I'm really happy about it. Muck
gave me a real opportunity to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Kovalev did not mention Campbell's name, but the inference was
clear when he said that he liked Muckler as much as Mike Keenan,
Campbell's predecessor, who coached the Rangers to the Stanley Cup
in 1994. ``He tells me lot of things to help me,'' Kovalev said of
Muckler.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talks a lot. He's a really nice coach. He helps me a lot
and I appreciate it. I really like Keenan. I think these are two of
the best coaches I've worked with.''
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to Campbell, it must be remembered that he, too,
tried to communicate with Kovalev. They had their feuds, their
tests of wills, their reconciliations, their parting.
</P>
<P>
   The next night in L.A., Kovalev's most dynamic moment came not
on his goals but on an early body check. In front of the team
benches, he lined up Matt Johnson, the 6-foot-5-inch, 232-pound
Kong of the Kings. The force of the hit bent Johnson over the
boards and left an impression on everyone, especially Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the opportunity to put my body against him,'' Kovalev
said. ``That's what I did.'' And, once again, in another season,
under another coach, Kovalev has the opportunities. He has the ice
time. He has Wayne Gretzky as a linemate. He has the hopes and best
wishes of the management, his teammates and the fans. So what will
he do _ soar with the eagles or crash to earth?

MAN DIES LEAPING FROM FIRE AND TWO ARE INJURED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Brooklyn man died early Saturday after he and his
wife jumped from a second-floor window while trying to escape a
fire raging in their Crown Heights apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Henry Brown, 58, died at Kings County Hospital Center
shortly after jumping about 2:30 a.m. and suffering a
trauma-induced heart attack, fire officials said. His wife,
Eleanor, 60, was in the hospital Saturday in extremely critical
condition, suffering from second- and third-degree burns on her
face, chest and arms, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Brown's mother, Carrie Artis, 76, who was pulled from the
building by firefighters, was also in critical condition at the
hospital with similar burns, fire officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a heavy volume of fire coming out of there,'' said
James Spollen, a Fire Department spokesman. ``The couple was lying
in the street, and the mother was at the window. These people were
in very bad shape.''
</P>
<P>
   The blaze stunned neighbors who stood outside the family's home
at 254 Lincoln Rd., as firefighters desperately tried to
resuscitate Brown and care for his wife, who is known in the
community for her beautiful singing voice and her love of children.
</P>
<P>
   The couple ran a well-known private school for young children
called the Kiddie Academy in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of
Brooklyn, a neighbor said, and they were active in community
meetings on their block and at Baptist churches throughout the
borough. One neighbor said that Mrs. Brown was a deacon in
Bedford-Stuyvesant at the Concord Baptist Church, one of the
largest black congregations in the city, and often sang gospel
there.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``She would sing from her heart and had a beautiful religious
voice,'' said the neighbor, Ruby Oliver, 77, who lives across the
street from the Browns. ``It is really sad what has happened to her
family. The flames inside, we all just stood out there last night
and watched the firefighters. We didn't know what else to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire at the otherwise unoccupied two-story brownstone
started on the second floor shortly before 2:29 a.m. and quickly
began to engulf the apartment, Spollen said. Firefighters arrived
three minutes later, he said. Several began giving emergency
medical attention to Brown and his wife outside the building, while
another firefighter was taken up on a mechanized ladder and entered
a window to retrieve Mrs. Brown's mother, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-two firefighters responded to the blaze, which fire
investigators believe started when an electrical malfunction on the
second floor ignited several cans of paint thinner. Although the
fire was under investigation, fire officials said they did not
think it was suspicious. It was under control within 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said that Mrs. Artis had come from the South to stay
with her daughter, because her other daughter had been hospitalized
with an illness in Brooklyn. Henry Brown's mother was also in the
hospital, they added, and Mrs. Oliver noted that Brown had just
visited his mother on Friday night, a few hours before the fire
took his life and destroyed his home of three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Looking out of her window Saturday morning, Mrs. Oliver gazed at
the ruin across the street. ``Last night, you could see the fire
burning inside their home from here because the leaves have been
falling,'' she said. ``Now it is all gone, gutted, charred
completely through.''

LAWYERS TO CHALLENGE LOUIMA'S ACCOUNT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lawyers for four police officers charged with
brutalizing a Haitian immigrant in Brooklyn plan to challenge
crucial aspects of the man's horrific account, and at least one
lawyer is seeking information for use in impugning his honesty,
court papers indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen months after the man, Abner Louima, 31, reported that
four officers beat him in a police car and that two of them then
tortured him with a stick in a station house bathroom, the delayed
prosecution is finally picking up steam in the politically and
racially explosive case, and the outlines are emerging of sometimes
clashing defense strategies.
</P>
<P>
   The strategies, indicated in a spate of hearings and a barrage
of briefs filed in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn in recent weeks,
also include challenging the integrity of the federal investigation
and efforts by each officer to separate his trial from one or more
of the others'. That could prove crucial, the defense lawyers say,
because the use of important evidence may well depend on whether
certain defendants are tried together or separately.
</P>
<P>
   As for the hunt for information to challenge Louima's honesty,
the court papers show that one defense lawyer is demanding the
details of a lawsuit in which two men contend they were fired by an
insurance company to keep them from disclosing information about
``fraudulent insurance claims'' filed by Louima.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Louima said the allegation about bogus claims was
false, and a lawyer for the company, Country-Wide Insurance, said
that ``there was nothing to cover up'' and that the men were fired
for other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the brutality case moves closer to a trial, or trials,
the prosecution is taking steps to strengthen its case, by
continuing to seek potential evidence and by adding a charge last
week. The new charge came nine months after a federal grand jury in
Brooklyn indicted the four officers on charges of violating
Louima's civil rights and also indicted a sergeant on charges of
trying to cover up Louima's alleged beating in the police car.
</P>
<P>
   The officers are Justin Volpe, Charles Schwarz, Thomas Wiese and
Thomas Bruder. The four, who are white, are accused of beating
Louima in the car after he was arrested in a brawl outside a
Flatbush nightclub on Aug. 9, 1997. Volpe and Schwarz are also
accused of torturing him later in a bathroom of the 70th Precinct
station house, where, prosecutors say, Volpe rammed a stick into
Louima's rectum and then his mouth, causing severe internal
injuries, while Schwarz held him down.
</P>
<P>
   The officers and the sergeant, Michael Bellomo, deny all the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The new charge, conspiring to obstruct justice, accuses Schwarz,
Wiese and Bruder of scheming to keep Schwarz from being implicated
in the alleged bathroom attack.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last month, federal agents went back to the 70th Precinct
station house and retrieved three flashlights from Volpe's sealed
locker. A second Haitian immigrant, Patrick Antoine _ whom Volpe is
also charged with beating several blocks from the brawl outside the
nightclub _ said the officer hit him with a flashlight.
</P>
<P>
   The case is not expected to go to trial until spring. In the
meantime, the four accused officers and the sergeant are on an
unusual form of modified assignment. Such an assignment normally
involves an officer's turning in his gun and working in
administrative or other nonpatrol duties, but in this case the five
are not being permitted to perform any police work, though they
continue getting their pay.
</P>
<P>
   The defense briefs show that plans to challenge crucial
specifics of Louima's account will include efforts to undermine his
account of how many officers beat him in the police car, and when,
between his arrest and his arrival at the station house.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Schwarz, Wiese and Bruder say that this is
especially important for their clients because Louima did not
identify them as being among his assailants and that, as far as the
lawyers can tell now, the charges that the three officers
participated in the beating inside the police car seem to be built
on circumstantial evidence based on police records of which
officers were with Louima at given times between his arrest and his
arrival at the station house.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors, from the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn,
have repeatedly refused to detail the evidence they plan to use
against the officers.
</P>
<P>
   Defense papers also show that Volpe's lawyer, Marvyn Kornberg _
who cited the insurance case _ also plans to raise questions about
Louima's identification of Volpe as the officer who ``looks like
the guy'' who assaulted him with the stick in the station house
bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from arguing in his papers that ``looks like'' is not a
positive identification, Kornberg indicated he would stress at the
trial that before being shown the photographs from which Louima
selected Volpe, Louima ``described his assailant as having `spiked
hair,' which description clearly does not match or fit'' Volpe.
</P>
<P>
   But among the other evidence the prosecution is known to have
against Volpe is an account by an officer not accused of
involvement in the reported attack. He reportedly told
investigators that he saw Volpe escort Louima away from the
bathroom area to the cell area of the police station, and that
Louima's pants were around his ankles. Kornberg is expected to
counter this with testimony from two other officers who have said
they saw a different officer put Louima in a cell with his pants
down.  &QL;

MAN QUESTIONED IN KILLING OF BUFFALO DOCTOR IS RELEASED 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The FBI has interviewed and released one of two men who were
sought last week for questioning in connection with the sniper
slaying of a doctor in the Buffalo, N.Y., area who performed
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, Ronald Stauber and Michael Gingrich, were named
Thursday in a bulletin sent by the FBI office in Cleveland to
police departments across the country. The men were not termed
suspects, and FBI officials on Saturday played down the likelihood
that either was involved in the Oct. 23 killing of the doctor,
Barnett Slepian.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing dozens if not hundreds of interviews a day,''
said Paul Moskal, a spokesman for the FBI office in Buffalo. ``I
know of no information that would treat these two differently or
would put them in any other category from the hundreds of leads
we're investigating on a daily basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Moskal said one of the two men _ he said he did not know which
one _ had been located, interviewed and released. In its Friday
issue, The Hamilton (Ontario) Spectator quoted an officer in the
Amherst, N.Y., Police Department as saying that the FBI. bulletin
had indicated possible links between the two men and James Charles
Kopp, an abortion opponent who is being sought as a material
witness in the case. Amherst police officials declined to comment
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian, 52, an obstetrician and gynecologist, was shot through
the kitchen window of his home in Amherst shortly after he and his
wife returned home from synagogue on the night of Friday, Oct. 23.
He was one of three doctors who performed abortions in the Buffalo
area. Investigators in Canada and the United States are also
looking into four other sniper attacks on doctors who performed
abortions in Canada and western New York.
</P>
<P>
   Moskal said the two men apparently showed up at Slepian's house
the day after his death. They were trying to attend a prayer vigil
for Slepian but had been sent to his house by mistake, and a police
officer on duty took their names, Moskal said. ``They were being
sought for interviews just because they were literally in the area
after the homicide,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials said they were not certain whether Stauber or
Gingrich had been involved in antiabortion activities. The two men
are believed to live in the Cleveland area.
</P>
<P>
   Inspector Keith MacCaskill of the Winnipeg Police Service, a
Canadian member of a law-enforcement task force investigating all
five of the shootings, said he had never heard of the men.
</P>
<P>
   Moskal emphasized that no one has been named as a suspect in
Slepian's death. ``Just the fact that we are interviewing anyone
doesn't make them a subject or a suspect in this,'' he said.

SECRET, PERSISTENT NEGOTIATIONS LURED THE PATRIOTS TO HARTFORD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (js) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ During a campaign debate just five weeks ago,
Gov. John Rowland was asked what he was willing to do to lure the
New England Patriots to Connecticut. The governor smiled and
dismissed that as ``a hypothetical question, so it's very difficult
to plug in hypothetical holes,'' then talked about other economic
development ideas he considered more realistic.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a deal to move the National Football League team to
Connecticut's capital had been all but sealed for two months,
according to his aides. Talks were progressing so fast by late
summer, these aides said, that the governor's staff decided to put
them on ice because of fears about how they might disrupt his
campaign for re-election, which he won handily.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have done the deal, probably, during the summer or
early fall,'' Rowland, a Republican, said Friday. ``But if we had
announced it in September, you would have had 300 candidates for
the Legislature taking positions on it, and that's not a good
atmosphere for making good, concrete, sensible decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the governor's strategists had feared touching off a
debate over the benefits of a new stadium versus more money for
schools, while others fretted that if the effort unraveled, the
governor would be blamed. ``Even a whiff about the Patriots would
have started a frenzy,'' said Fergus Cullen, the deputy campaign
manager. ``It was a risk no one was willing to take.''
</P>
<P>
   The secrecy looked smart on Thursday, when grinning legislators
of both parties crowded behind Rowland and the Patriots' owner,
Robert Kraft, for the stunning announcement that the team would
abandon the Boston area, its home of 38 years, for a new stadium
that Connecticut has promised to build in downtown Hartford in time
for the 2001 season. The team and the state negotiated
intermittently for years, and even as word of fresh discussions
leaked out in the last several months, few officials outside
Rowland's tight circle believed until last week that anything would
come of them.
</P>
<P>
   By keeping the lid on Hartford's biggest story in years,
Rowland, 41, had the chance to establish a rapport with Kraft, 57,
in 10 face-to-face meetings, and to dicker over the fine print
outside the public glare. Now, though, the governor faces questions
about whether he drove a hard enough bargain when he promised to
build a $350-million stadium, which the team would use rent free
for 30 years. The provision that is sure to draw the most scrutiny
is a guarantee by the state that it would pay up to $17.5 million
for unsold empty luxury seats and boxes each season.
</P>
<P>
   A number of factors in both states had come together to produce
the rarest of achievements _ a huge stadium subsidy that was
negotiated in secret and greeted with little initial public
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft said he needed a more modern stadium with lucrative
features like sky boxes, but wanted to stay in his native New
England. Yet his relations with the Massachusetts Legislature had
deteriorated to name-calling. Hartford, which had been withering
for decades, now had a detailed strategy for a makeover of its
riverfront, championed by a business community that had tasted
success when the city had held a presidential debate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most importantly, Rowland had made urban revitalization
the keynote of his campaign, and thus was eager to land a big
project to illustrate his contention that the future success of the
Republican Party involved helping cities. He had spent a year
building bridges to the Democrats who control both houses of the
Legislature, and he now had the clout that comes with winning by 28
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   As the governor basked in his success at landing a project that
could change Hartford's image overnight, a bit of a stadium
hangover set in on Friday. State legislators, who must act on the
plan by the end of the year, began wading through the 18-page
agreement. They said that they found it much more generous to Kraft
than had been revealed in the summary that the governor's office
provided.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the uncertainties, legislative leaders seem determined
to pass the plan in a special session in mid-December. In the
meantime, Hartford is enjoying a full-blown football fever, from
the vitamin store that is giving a 10 percent discount to patrons
who sign a petition supporting the team, to the television station
that picked out luxury homes and cars that might be suited to
specific Patriots players.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get the brass ring, why ask about the lead content?''
asked Wilson Faude, executive director of the Old State House, a
restored Main Street landmark that was the seat of Connecticut's
post-Revolutionary government.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After months of getting-to-know-you chats between Rowland and
Kraft, and countless conference calls among the governor's aides
and the Patriots' lawyers, the talks turned to real numbers in May,
when the two men surveyed the future stadium site from a conference
room on the 16th floor of the building that houses Phoenix Home
Life Mutual Insurance Co., which has been the most visible
proponent of a splashy new development on the Connecticut River.
</P>
<P>
   If there were any doubts about Kraft's seriousness, he brought
along Paul Tagliabue, the commissioner of the NFL. Their guide was
Robert Fiondella, president of the insurance company and sponsor of
a $1 billion project called Adriaen's Landing.
</P>
<P>
   Fiondella produced drawings that looked like a Tomorrowland
vision of Hartford and began pointing to the features planned for
Adriaen's Landing: a stadium for the Patriots and the University of
Connecticut, a convention center, a hotel, a rooftop restaurant, a
museum that looks like a solarium, an indoor mountain-climbing
range, a jazz club, a 14-screen movie theater. Then they stepped to
the window.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just imagine the Goodyear blimp on a Monday night, showing
this majestic scene,'' Fiondella recalled rhapsodizing. He conjured
a stadium, motioned to the river nearby, then up the hill to the
gold-leaf grandeur of the Capitol dome, and finally pointed to the
confluence of Interstates 84 and 91, which he called ``the
crossroads of the Northeast.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft would say later that it was the specificity of Hartford's
plans that bowled him over.
</P>
<P>
   That winter, his 34-year-old son, Jonathan Kraft, who is chief
executive of a Connecticut paper company and a Patriots vice
president, had shown him pictures of the Adriaen's Landing plans
that had run in a newspaper when the state Legislature approved
$300 million for revitalization of Hartford. At Thursday's
announcement, Kraft gestured to the lawmakers arrayed behind him
and said, ``When we saw that the people standing behind here had
passed this legislation for the rejuvenation of Hartford, we
realized that this could be an opportunity for us.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Massachusetts House of Representatives was
continuing to balk at his demands for a new stadium. In July, in
what turned out to be a goodbye card to the Bay State, Kraft
submitted a blistering Op-Ed article to The Boston Globe,
complaining about the ``shortsighted intransigence on the part of
the leadership of the Massachusetts House,'' particularly its
speaker, Thomas Finneran. It ran with the headline, ``Blame the
Speaker for Stadium Stalemate.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued talking with Rowland. ``I had to read the timing of
it _ when to strike and when to deliver,'' Rowland said Friday.
Kevin Sullivan, president pro tem of the Connecticut Senate, said:
``There are times when the governor's _ how do I want to say this?
_ boyish enthusiasm doesn't serve him well. This is one of those
times that it paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Nov. 13, only details remained. Kraft was going to
fly into a private airport just outside Hartford; to avoid
publicity, he and the governor decided to meet in a hangar. When,
at the last minute, Kraft drove down instead, they met in the
hangar anyway, in a scene that the governor later described as
``Miami Vice-like.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, who had once referred to Kraft as ``very crafty,''
realized he would look like a fool if his deal turned out to be
just a bargaining chip for the Patriots to get their way with the
Massachusetts Legislature. So the last major term to be settled was
a $2 million fine Kraft would pay if he opened negotiations with
another state. Rowland's critics are calling it his ``ego
protection money.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men set about courting legislators. Last Sunday night, the
Senate majority leader, George Jepsen, was drinking red wine at his
Stamford home when the governor called to tell him about the
Patriots deal. The next day, in a meeting with the top six
legislative leaders, Rowland spelled out the details. ``We're in
this together, or we're not in it,'' several of them quoted him as
saying. That afternoon, Kraft flew to Hartford and stopped by
legislators' offices to answer their questions about the deal.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:30 p.m. on Wednesday, Rowland and Kraft talked on the
phone. Their lawyers were still haggling, but they were close
enough that the governor told his communications director, Dean
Pagani, that he could announce a news conference for 11 a.m. the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   The final ``T'' was crossed at 1:45 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The governor and Kraft now must convince legislators that
although the deal seems quite sweet for Kraft, the spillover
effects will be a bonanza for Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   One of the many unadvertised provisions of the contract is a
guarantee _ unusual even in these days of rich stadium deals for
teams _ of up to $10 million in annual sales for club seats and
$7.5 million for luxury suites. If sales fall short, the state will
make up the difference. In addition to giving the Patriots the
stadium rent-free for 30 years, the state will pay the stadium's
insurance and major repair bills. The right to sell the stadium's
name will go to the team.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the Patriots will pay the state a 10 percent tax on
ticket sales and invest $75 million in a hotel and stores for
downtown Hartford. The team will keep its share of the profits from
these ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing for us to subsidize a private enterprise, but
now we're guaranteeing them a profit,'' said Rep. Richard Tulisano,
a Democrat. ``God bless Robert Kraft for getting this deal. But in
a recession, the state may have to decide whether it wants to buy
school books or keep paying for this stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   At least so far, his is a lonely voice. If lawmakers change even
a comma, Kraft can back out. Legislative leaders want the deal, and
have even said they plan to have Kraft speak privately to their
caucuses to soothe fears. The kind of changes they're talking about
are asking Kraft to provide 100 or so tickets a game to
underprivileged Hartford young people.
</P>
<P>
   And Rowland remains a sunny salesman, ready to charm his state
the same way he did Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only risk will be the critics, who will say we could have
done something different,'' he said. ``But for 30 years, we've
haven't had any cranes in the air, and we haven't had any
excitement. We're going to make this happen.''

COLLEGE PRESIDENT REBUKED FOR CRITICIZING UNIVERSITY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a letter that some City University of New York
officials criticized as an effort that could curb free speech, the
chairwoman of the CUNY board rebuked the president of Brooklyn
College for remarks he made at the June commencement.
</P>
<P>
   In the sharply worded letter dated Thursday, CUNY Chairwoman
Anne Paolucci said she had recently read the commencement speech,
and she chided Brooklyn College President Vernon Lattin for
criticizing the board's policies on remedial education in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I was alarmed by a certain lack of perspective
and by your open challenge to policies enacted by this Board of
Trustees,'' she wrote in the letter, which was sent to CUNY's
trustees, presidents and administrators, as well as to Lattin and
his staff.
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``As the president of a CUNY college, I expect you to
understand this policy and its rationale, to publicly support it
and to work to insure that it succeeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Copies of the letter were provided to The New York Times by
people who were concerned by it. Several trustees said Friday that
they saw the letter as inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to put the fear of God in the presidents,'' said Edith
Everett, a CUNY trustee, who said she was writing a response to Ms.
Paolucci. ``They're already fearful. I feel like this is a police
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Herman Badillo, vice chairman of the CUNY board, said he was
surprised by the scolding letter _ and by its wide circulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like you are trying to undermine the guy,'' he said.
``If you have a problem, you just call him in.''
</P>
<P>
   Other CUNY presidents also expressed reservations, saying they
feared that the letter would be one more disincentive to public
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand her being upset if she thinks a president is
not following policy,'' said one president, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. ``But for us not to be able to comment is
very chilling on academic freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Lattin said Friday that he had just received the letter in the
mail and had not had time to think much about it yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry the chairwoman did not like my speech and made her
opposition so public,'' he said, adding that the speech ``speaks
for itself'' and that he had no other comment.
</P>
<P>
   In the speech, ``A Crisis in American Education,'' Lattin did
not refer to City University trustees specifically. But he said
that politicians wanted to restrict access to the university and
that ``policy makers are developing specific policies that restrict
access and reduce equity.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, the trustees had voted to bar students who could not
pass placement tests in reading, writing and mathematics from
entering their four-year colleges. The decision was widely debated
by CUNY's students, faculty and by educators outside the
university, and is on hold pending a lawsuit over the state's open
meetings law and the trustees' compliance.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech the next month, Lattin also said that the state
and the country were ``disinvesting in higher education'' and that
``the great public education you received at Brooklyn College _ and
could have received at SUNY, or the University of Wisconsin or the
University of California _ may not be available to your children
and grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked Saturday about the criticisms of her letter, Ms. Paolucci
said, ``He made public comments, and I thought I should remind him
that we were addressing these things.'' She said she had no further
comment.
</P>
<P>
   In her letter, she said the new remedial education policy ``will
permit instruction to begin on a higher plane and end on a higher
plane, and it will move basic skills course work to where it
belongs _ at the entry-level campuses.''

<P>
   Ralph L. Wickiser, a painter and teacher who founded the fine
arts graduate program at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, N.Y.,
died Oct. 27 in a nursing home in Riverhead, N.Y. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   A modernist abstract painter, Wickiser drew much of his imagery
from nature, particularly, in the last two decades, from the
landscape near Woodstock, N.Y., where he had spent summers since
1948 and where he had lived since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   His teaching career began at Louisiana State University in 1937.
In 1959 he began working at Pratt, where he administered an art
department whose faculty included Franz Kline, Jacob Lawrence, Roy
Lichtenstein and Philip Pearlstein. In 1962 he founded the school's
Graduate Programs in Art and Design and served as director, acting
dean and chairman until 1975. He also published two widely used
textbooks on art education.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Jane; two sons, Eric, of
Bloomington, Minn., and Walter, of New York; a daughter, Lydia Anne
Tortora of Mattituck, N.Y.; and three sisters, Helen Pier of
Granite City, Ill., Alice Taylor of Urbana, Ill., and Mary Riedy of
Phoenix.

YANKEES WOULD BE PRIDE OF CABLEVISION'S GROWING EMPIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: NY-YANKEES-MAYOR) 
(mk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Adding the New York Yankees to its ownership of the
New York Knicks and New York Rangers further would escalate
Cablevision Systems' growth into one of the most powerful forces in
sports and would expand the Woodbury, N.Y.-based company's
entertainment diversification.
</P>
<P>
   Automatically, the Yankees would become the best known asset in
Cablevision's empire, which includes cable systems serving 3.4
million subscribers, Madison Square Garden and the Nobody Beats the
Wiz electronics chain, which it bought out of bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner was an obscure shipbuilder from Cleveland
when he and his partners paid $10 million to buy the Yankees from
CBS in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Owning the 1998 World Series champions, who have the most
storied history in sports, would give Cablevision the national
stature it lacks outside the cable industry.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Steinbrenner could boast of being a three-sport owner,
as Cablevision could be with a deal, joining an exclusive club with
Time Warner, which owns the Atlanta Braves, Hawks and Thrashers, a
National Hockey League expansion team that starts play in the fall
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Huizenga, who owns the Miami Dolphins and Miami Heat, is
leaving the three-team fraternity with his $150 million sale of the
Florida Marlins, which still must be approved by Major League
Baseball. Other two-team owners include Walt Disney Co. (Anaheim
Mighty Ducks and Angels), Jerry Reinsdorf (Chicago White Sox and
Bulls), Paul Allen (Seattle Seahawks and Portland Trail Blazers),
Abe Pollin (Washington Capitals and Wizards) and Thomas Hicks
(Texas Rangers and Dallas Stars).
</P>
<P>
   Charles Dolan, chairman of Cablevision, is the personal
antithesis of the bombastic Steinbrenner. Dolan is a rare presence
at Knicks and Rangers games, an owner who never talks about player
performance, but pushes his management to increase cash flow by
increasing usage of the arena and adjacent Theater at Madison
Square Garden, where shows like ``A Christmas Carol'' and ``The
Wizard of Oz'' play.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan understands the value of sports team ownership, but he
views owning a team as something that can benefit his media
holdings. Almost 20 years ago, he tried to buy the Chicago White
Sox. As a personal investment with his brother, Dolan tried to buy
the expansion Cleveland Browns, which sold for $530 million, a
record until now.
</P>
<P>
   For Steinbrenner, the Yankees are a personal and business asset,
which have enriched him and made him the most famous owner in
sports. The possibility that he might stay on if Cablevision bought
the club, as the overlord of the Rangers, Knicks and Yankees, would
appear to set the stage for a battle with Dave Checketts, president
of Madison Square Garden, who oversees the teams.
</P>
<P>
   Before buying the Garden with ITT for $1.05 billion in 1994,
Cablevision was a powerful cable company with systems in New York,
Boston, Cleveland, Chicago and other areas, and the owner of
regional sports channels like SportsChannel New York.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not viewed as a sports world titan. That has all
changed.
</P>
<P>
   Owning the Knicks and Rangers, the arena they play in, and the
MSG Network, which carries their games to cable customers in the
New York region, offers a synergy that has enriched Cablevision
with all available advertising and sponsorship revenues. (Last
year, Cablevision paid $650 million to buy out ITT's ownership.)
</P>
<P>
   Owning the Yankees would guarantee that the Yankees would be
seen on MSG in perpetuity, and that no potential competitor could
snare the team's valuable cable rights with a preemptive bid. It
also would unburden Cablevision from paying a rights fee.
</P>
<P>
   MSG is entering the next-to-last year of a $486 million, 12-year
deal with the Yankees, which will peak at $55.25 million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees' bottom line could suffer without an outside
party paying the largest local rights fee to any team in sports.
Strip away $55 million from the Yankees' revenues, and can this
team sustain payrolls that are at or near baseball's highest?
Presumably, Cablevision would not buy the Yankees to play Scrooge
on salaries.
</P>
<P>
   But Cablevision's owning the Yankees would doubtless provide its
detractors with more ammunition for their charges that the company
is monopolizing New York sports. Not only would Cablevision own
three teams locally, but it would also control the cable telecasts
of seven teams: the Yankees, the Rangers and the Knicks on MSG, and
the Nets, the Islanders, the Devils and the Mets on Fox Sports New
York, a regional service that is part of the Fox Sports Net, a
joint cable sports venture with the Fox/Liberty Networks.
</P>
<P>
   It is not apparent how Cablevision's ownership of the team would
change the ongoing question about a new stadium. The Yankee Stadium
lease expires after the 2002 season and Steinbrenner has stayed
uncharacteristically quiet about whether he will stay in the Bronx
in a renovated ballpark, demand that the city pursue a rocky legal
path to building a $1 billion stadium on the West Side of
Manhattan, or move to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever the Yankees play, it is very likely that Cablevision
would use the stadium to market an array of products, whether it's
phone service; electronics through the Nobody Beats the Wiz chain
that it acquired last year for $92 million; tickets to events at
Radio City Music Hall, which it leases through its purchase of
Radio City Productions, or tickets to theaters like the Ziegfeld or
Beekman, two of 76 theaters recently acquired for $252 million.
</P>
<P>
   All those acquisitions, plus the decision to finance the
overhaul of ``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' musical on Broadway, which
reopened earlier this month, symbolize Cablevision's emergence as a
corporate entertainment impresario with enormous tentacles.
</P>
<P>
   When Cablevision recently began high-definition television
telecasts of Rangers games on MSG, it made them available inside
the Garden's two restaurants and at selected Wiz stores, which sell
the expensive HDTV sets.

NEW URGENCY DISPLAYED IN NBA TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to add number of games lost in 2nd graf and to correct length
of lockout from 144 to 145 days in 4th graf.) (mk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chris Dudley looked haggard, like a trader whose
stock was stuck on a roller coaster. While he managed to emerge
upbeat from a negotiating session late Friday night, he was like
most of his peers: He had no idea when he would be paid to play
basketball again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a house of cards right now,'' said Dudley, whose Knicks
have now lost four games to the National Basketball Association's
nearly five-month-old labor dispute. ``It looks like we're moving
in the right direction, but everything is so conditional, it could
fall apart at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the fear of losing the season motivated them or not,
players and owners displayed a new urgency. They negotiated face to
face for almost 10 hours, making compromises on two key economic
issues that may go a long way toward salvaging a significantly
shortened schedule.
</P>
<P>
   It was not only the longest bargaining session of the lockout,
now in its 145th day, but also the most productive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say our negotiating committee came in with our pajamas
and their negotiating committee came in with theirs too,'' NBA
Commissioner David Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   Participants on both sides of the meeting said each had moved at
least a couple of points off their requested numbers for total
revenue distribution. The owners wanted no more than 50 percent
paid out to player salaries, while the players wanted to make as
much as 60 percent of the income. It was unclear what the exact
figures were.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the owners have agreed to accept, with several conditions,
the framework of an escrow plan. The plan would be put in place in
the fourth through sixth years of a proposed seven-year agreement,
and would include players withholding a percentage of their
salaries at the beginning of the season.
</P>
<P>
   If an agreed-upon percentage were exceeded, then the fund would
be used to pay the owners back. The players had offered to withhold
as much as 10 percent of their annual salaries in those years.
</P>
<P>
   No further negotiations were scheduled for the weekend, but both
sides planned to resume bargaining before Thanksgiving. The league
and the union were also doubtful that a deal could be struck this
week, meaning the possibility of playing in 1998 is all but gone.
</P>
<P>
   If negotiations continued at the current pace, a more likely
scenario would be an agreement in principle by the first week of
December and perhaps starting the season the first week of January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very concerned, but I'm hopeful,'' Stern said Friday when
asked if he still feared losing the season to labor strife. ``It's
quite a hill that we have to climb. What we confirmed tonight is
that we've got two different views of the way we come at the these
issues. All I can tell you is, their highest and our lowest aren't
matching, and that means there's still a pretty good gap between
us. And that covers a lot of issues, and that's going to be a real
problem. But the best way we can deal with that is the way we're
dealing with it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the longest bargaining session since Oct. 28, when
Michael Jordan tried to broker a deal with Stern and other chief
negotiators until 1 a.m. Since then, the parties have engaged in
rhetoric and name-calling and done everything but make progress on
a new collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But with genuine concerns over lost games and player salaries,
the two sides put away their animosity and began to work toward a
settlement on Friday. After players made the first move _ a change
to their escrow tax plan _ owners made a counterproposal that
included the change. The players then came back with yet another
offer.
</P>
<P>
   In the hallways between sessions, owners and players could be
seen talking congenially with each other. It was a stark contrast
to the last meeting at the same midtown Manhattan hotel three weeks
ago, when at least one owner and player engaged in a shouting match
during a give-and-take session.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, we can say we had a productive day,'' the
deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, said. ``We both realized that the
season is in jeopardy here and to find out if we can or cannot make
a deal.'''
</P>
<P>
   While there was sincere encouragement, the owners and the
players seemed to understand they had a long road ahead of them
before a deal could be struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides want to do something, but both sides have some
serious issues that they feel real strongly about,'' Dudley said.
``It's a frustrating process. I don't want to lose the season, but
we're getting closer and closer to that time. I'm happy with the
progress, but it's still definitely a concern.''

REAL ESTATE: CO-OPS THAT DON'T OWN THEIR LAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ People who invest in real estate typically do so
secure in the knowledge that their little patch of land can be
theirs _ or their heirs' _ forever.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who buy co-op or condominium apartments generally
take comfort in owning a home _ indirectly in the case of a co-op,
where they own shares in the building _ that they can pass on to
their children when they die.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another form of real estate investment, known as a
ground-lease co-op, that falls somewhere between renting and owning
a home. And, depending on whom you talk to, the purchase of an
apartment in a ground-lease co-op can be a great deal, a situation
with unpredictable risks or something in between.
</P>
<P>
   ``Owning a co-op with a ground lease is like having a chronic
rash,'' said Alan Kucker, a Manhattan co-op lawyer. ``It's not
going to kill you, but it's always there and it sure can be
irritating.''
</P>
<P>
   Kucker explained that a relatively small number of New York
co-ops are on land that the co-op corporation itself does not own.
In such cases, he said, the co-op typically leases the ground from
the owner of the property _ frequently, the co-op's original
sponsor. Generally, he said, the lease provides for rent to be paid
on the land over a fairly long term, often up to 99 years, and
contain provisions for extending the lease and increasing the rent
at specific intervals.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, another consideration: ``At the end of the
lease, the building usually reverts to the owner of the property,''
Kucker said. ``That's where things start to get hairy.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, when an ordinary co-op needs to borrow
money for capital improvements, the co-op corporation can go to a
lender and take out a new mortgage. A ground-lease co-op, however,
would not be able to do that _ at least not easily _ because a
lender usually wants the mortgage secured by both the structure and
the land. And if the co-op doesn't own the land, it can't provide
the lender with the security it requires.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the co-op could persuade a lender to take only the
building as collateral, Kucker said, some ground leases require the
co-op to get the property owner's permission to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one ground-lease co-op that had a restriction in the
lease that said the co-op couldn't borrow money without the
permission of the property owner,'' he said. ``Every time we would
go to the owner to get his permission, he would hassle us.''
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding such problems, however, there doesn't appear to
be any shortage of buyers for co-op units in buildings with ground
leases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's buyers are more educated than ever before,'' said Rhea
Stein, a sales agent for the Corcoran Group, a Manhattan brokerage.
``And once they understand how these buildings work they become
much more open to them because they realize that the lease can work
in their favor.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ms. Stein said, she recently sold a two-bedroom,
two-bath co-op unit in a ground-lease building in Tudor City for
$350,000. ``That's at least $50,000 less than it would have
commanded in a non-land-leased building,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ms. Stein said, in the last year alone she has sold six
apartments in the same 300-plus-unit building _ 2 Tudor City Place,
which is the only building in the seven-building midtown complex
that has a ground lease.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stein's employer, Barbara Corcoran, is herself an owner of a
ground-lease co-op on the Upper East Side. ``Another advantage to
purchasing in a land-lease property is that the owners typically
keep them in excellent physical and fiscal condition to woo buyers
with value and quality,'' Ms. Corcoran said.
</P>
<P>
   William Greenberg, a Manhattan accountant who specializes in
co-op and condominium finances, has somewhat different feelings
about co-ops with ground leases.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in one, you can be faced with some serious
problems,'' Greenberg said. ``I've seen some absolutely
unbelievable increases in ground rents.'' He said that in some
leases, the rent paid by the co-op to the property owner is
calculated as a percentage of the appraised value of the property.
In addition, most leases contain clauses that provide for an
increase in rent after a certain time, often 10 years or so.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Greenberg said, an appreciable increase in the
value of the property from one rent adjustment to another can
result in a big increase in rent that will be reflected in each
shareholder's monthly maintenance fees. Moreover, he said, since
the property owner and the co-op frequently obtain widely different
appraisals, the matter must often be resolved by arbitration.
``That can end up being an expensive procedure for everyone
concerned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another disadvantage of owing a co-op in a building with a
ground lease, he said, is that the portion of maintenance charges
used to pay the ground rent is not deductible on shareholders' tax
returns. If the co-op owned the property subject to an underlying
mortgage, on the other hand, the portion of maintenance
attributable to interest on the loan would be deductible.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I try to persuade the buildings I work for to do
everything possible to try and buy the property from the owner,''
Greenberg said. ``But the one big problem is to get the landowner
to agree.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Kucker, the co-op lawyer, has had some experience in that
regard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a small building in Brooklyn that was paying $500 a
year in ground rent to the owner,'' Kucker said. ``We went to him
and said, `We'll give you $50,000 to buy you out,' and he said
`No.' We ended up paying him $100,000 just to be free of the
hassle.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Weinstein, a Manhattan lawyer and vice president of the
Council of New York Cooperatives, said that those thinking of
buying into a building with a ground lease should make sure they
have sufficient information to make an informed decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to know both the term of the lease and whether it
provides for any extensions,'' Weinstein said, explaining that
while a lease with 40 years left on an initial term of 99 years
might have been a safe investment 59 years ago, it is less so now
and will be a dubious investment 20 years in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``You also need to know how rent increases are going to be
calculated,'' he said. ``If the lease contains a regular escalation
clause, that's not a problem. But if the increases are tied to
market value appraisals, that can be a real killer.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Weinstein said, it is certainly possible for
buyers to get more apartment for their money when purchasing in a
ground-lease co-op.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Klapper, a Manhattan real estate lawyer who recently
bought a three-bedroom apartment in a ground-lease co-op on the
Upper East Side, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I would prefer not to have a ground lease on the
building,'' Klapper said. ``But I ended up getting an apartment I
couldn't have gotten under other circumstances. And eventually
we'll have to sit down with the owner and try to buy the land from
him. But I think that's something every board in a ground-lease
co-op should ultimately consider.''

BRIAN JORDAN STILL AVAILABLE, HIS AGENT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The belief that Brian Jordan will sign with the Atlanta Braves
and become their right fielder is erroneous, his agent said
Saturday, leaving open the possibility that Jordan could still sign
with the Mets or the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Turner, the St. Louis-based agent, said the race for Jordan
remained wide open, though it would not necessarily be so for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do something by Wednesday,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, he emphasized, do not have Jordan, an Atlanta
resident, wrapped up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where anyone would get that opinion,'' Turner
said. ``I've refuted it everywhere I've gone. Brian was taken aback
by it. It clearly is not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, Turner awaited a call from Steve Phillips, the
Mets' general manager. He said he spoke with Brian Cashman, the
Yankees' general manager, Friday night. He had not received an
offer from either. The Braves and the Baltimore Orioles had made
offers, he said, neither for five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have five years yet,'' Turner said. ``The fifth year
is really important to us. We told the Mets if you give us
something we haven't received from anybody else, he may be your
right fielder.''
</P>
<P>
   He could also become the Yankees' center fielder if they end
negotiations with Bernie Williams and decide not to bring Albert
Belle into their harmonious clubhouse. ''The impression I got from
Brian,'' Turner said, ``was he'll know more after they have an
internal situation over the weekend. He knows what my time-frame
is. If they haven't reconciled it by next week, it won't include us
anyway. I'm comfortable with where we are. I know we're going to be
done by Wednesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is viewed as a free agent who is on the level below
Belle, Williams and Mo Vaughn. He is expected to command around $8
million to $9 million a year.

 &HT;    RENO TO RULE ON GORE, CLINTON FUND-RAISING PROBES
 &HT;    570 words
 &HT;    For release Monday, Nov. 23
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An off-again, on-again controversy reheats this
week, as Attorney General Janet Reno decides by Tuesday whether to
seek an independent counsel to probe Vice President Al Gore's
fund-raising from his White House office.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is just one of several moves that will bring the
1996 Democratic fund-raising back into focus during the next two
weeks. Reno is considering seeking two more independent probes, one
into President Clinton's fund-raising and another into the role of
former senior aide Harold Ickes in his dealing with the Teamsters
Union.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Federal Election Commission early next month is
expected to take up a Clinton-Gore re-election audit that raises
questions about whether the campaign violated federal spending
limits and should repay $13.4 million in federal matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gore case, investigators have been examining whether he
misled government officials when they asked about the funds he
raised on his office telephone in the 1996 campaign. Reno cleared
Gore on a related question earlier, but she ordered a
re-examination after new information surfaced on the question of
whether he was raising unregulated ``soft'' donations or regulated
``hard'' money for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Though the issue appears to be highly technical, the appointment
of an independent counsel would put Gore in the center of ethics
controversies he has successfully averted until now. A probe could
possibly complicate his pursuit of the presidency in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A Gore spokesman said Friday of the Reno decision: ``Wherever it
takes us, ultimately we are confident that it will show that
everything the vice president did was legal and proper.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Simon, vice chairman of Common Cause, a private group that
favors tough campaign finance laws, said the Gore matter is
overshadowed by Reno's decision, due by Dec. 8, on whether to seek
a probe into Clinton's role in overseeing $44 million in Democratic
National Committee ``issue'' ads for the 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Critics charge those ads were directly tied to the Clinton
campaign and therefore violated the federal spending limit for
presidential campaigns that accept public funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is a very serious matter,'' Simon said. Unless
Reno launches a probe of this matter, the law becomes
``meaningless,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Simon said if Reno were to trigger a probe of Clinton's
fund-raising, an independent counsel would almost certainly delve
into explosive issues, such as foreign contributions, that have
been simmering since the fall of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   On yet another front, the House Judiciary Committee, in its
impeachment inquiry of Clinton, has subpoenaed an internal Justice
Department memo that urged Reno to appoint an independent counsel
for the fund-raising issue.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who has resisted that advice for more than a year and a
half, has yet to allow Congress to see the entire memo, written by
Charles LaBella, who formerly headed up a task force to investigate
possible campaign fund-raising abuses. A House committee voted to
find the attorney general in contempt for refusing to turn over the
document, but the full House has never taken up the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's now in limbo,'' said John Williams, spokesman for the
sponsor of the contempt citation, House Government Reform and
Oversight Committee Chairman Dan Burton, R-Ind.

29 ARRESTED IN RAID ON MIDTOWN BAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Twenty-nine people were arrested early Saturday in a
police raid on a midtown bar long cited by neighbors as a haven for
prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the raid on Club Edelweiss, on 11th Avenue near 43rd
Street, followed a monthlong investigation into drug sales there.
</P>
<P>
   Of those arrested, 15 were charged with prostitution, two with
soliciting prostitutes and six with permitting prostitution in the
club, said Detective Joseph Pentangelo, a police spokesman. Six
others were charged with selling drugs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at the club were also given summonses for the illegal
sale of alcohol to minors and for failing to display a liquor
license, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests followed repeated complaints by neighbors that many
of the transvestite prostitutes in the area had worked out of the
club since it opened five years ago. It has been closed twice
before, once after prostitution arrests there in 1997 and again
when the state Liquor Authority temporarily suspended its liquor
license this year.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Feldt, a community leader who lives nearby, said she
hoped the arrests would stop the prostitution activity. ``But I'm a
little jaded by now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the club was reopened about eight months ago, it was like
spotlights were put out saying `Come back prostitutes,''' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said they intended to go to court to have the
club padlocked. Officers began looking into activity at the club
again after an informant reported drug sales there in September.
Undercover officers then began to patronize the club, making 12
drug purchases from six men between Sept. 12 and Nov. 13.

REAL ESTATE: TAKING A REMODELING BEYOND SKIN-DEEP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For many homeowners, the strategy for planning a home
renovation project is like the one used when planning a visit to
the dentist: Fix whatever's broken, please, and leave everything
else alone.
</P>
<P>
   There is an argument to be made, however, that home renovation
should be less like dentistry and more like holistic medicine,
where a tweak here prevents a twinge there and a bit of prevention
could head off major problems later.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, construction specialists say, almost any renovation
project presents opportunities for homeowners not only to address
short-term problems or improvements but to realize the long-term
benefits of making homes safer, more energy-efficient and less
susceptible to the ravages of time and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many architects today, saving energy is the primary
focus,'' said Chris Benedict, a Manhattan architect who specializes
in energy-efficient design and renovation. ``And we're finding that
by making energy efficiency our focus, we can't help but end up
with healthier, more durable housing.''
</P>
<P>
   Specialists like Ms. Benedict operate from the premise that a
house is more than a lifeless collection of wood, plaster, pipes,
vents and wires. Houses breathe, they say, inhaling at one place
and exhaling at another. Houses have circulatory systems, too _
heating, plumbing, ventilation and electrical circuits _ all of
which operate either efficiently or erratically by delivering more
or less of whatever is needed to wherever it is needed at the time.
</P>
<P>
   And houses can be healthy or they can be sick, such as when
moisture, warmth and airborne spores converge to form hidden
colonies of mold and mildew; or when a breath taken by the attic
draws harmful carbon monoxide from the basement. ``A house must be
thought of as a system,'' Ms. Benedict said. ``And the system must
be thoughtfully designed.''
</P>
<P>
   Since many existing houses were built before architects and
designers fully realized the extent to which individual building
elements affect one another, however, most homes can benefit from
some retrospectively applied thoughtful design.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about every remodeling project presents a unique
opportunity to make your house more efficient, more comfortable and
more personally suited to you,'' said Alan Meier, executive editor
of Home Energy magazine and a staff scientist at the Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif. ``And no matter
what kind of change you make, there is a good chance it will affect
how the house functions as a system.''
</P>
<P>
   Building an addition to a house, for example, would obviously
affect the way heat in the house is distributed, Meier said.
</P>
<P>
   But so would removing an existing wall to make one large room
out of two smaller ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's not just heat you have to think about,'' he said.
``You have to think in terms of all five senses.''
</P>
<P>
   Removing a wall between a kitchen and a dining room _ a
relatively common renovation project in older homes today _ will
not only alter the way heat circulates through the house, but is
also likely to introduce new sounds and smells into the living
space, Meier said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want whatever's being cooked in the kitchen to
permeate the entire living area,'' he said. ``So you need to make
sure you've got the proper ventilation.''
</P>
<P>
   Installing proper ventilation, however, is only half the battle;
residents have to turn it on for it to be of any use. ``Most range
hoods are too noisy,'' Meier said. ``So people don't use them as
much as they should.''
</P>
<P>
   One solution, he said, is to install one of the newer, quieter,
energy-efficient ventilation fans. Another is to install a
remote-mounted fan in an area other than the kitchen (such as in a
crawl space _ provided the fan is vented to the exterior of the
building) and connect the fan to the range hood with a 6- or 8-inch
duct.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, any time you have air being pulled out of a house by
a ventilation system, you have the same amount of air being pulled
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``You start with a fixed volume of air,'' said David Johnston,
president of What's Working, a construction-industry consulting
firm in Boulder, Colo. ``Now, you turn on your kitchen fan, or your
bathroom fan, or even your clothes dryer, and what you're doing is
creating negative pressure. The next thing you know, you're sucking
air through every crack in the house to make up the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said that with leaky houses, sucking in the necessary
air is fairly easy. But easy isn't necessarily good.
</P>
<P>
   In the winter, for example, the air getting sucked in is usually
cold. That results in drafts, uneven heating and high energy bills.
And since cold air holds less moisture than warm air, outside air
that enters a house in winter usually ends up lowering the relative
humidity inside, making the air dry and the occupants
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Johnson said, in leaky houses, cold outside air can be
pulled into the house even when there aren't any ventilation fans
doing the pulling. That results from what is known as the ``stack
effect,'' in which warm air inside the house rises through cracks
and holes in floors and walls to the attic while pulling air from
lower parts of the house behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``One place people usually don't suspect is where the pipes come
up from the basement to the upper stories,'' Johnston said, adding
that since pipes coming through walls often have decorative
circular plates that hide the holes around them, many homeowners
erroneously believe that the holes are adequately sealed.
</P>
<P>
   And pulling air into a house from the basement, he said, can be
a problem. ``You can pull all kinds of stuff out of a basement and
into the house,'' Johnston said, adding that sewer gas, pesticides
and even radon are but a few examples.
</P>
<P>
   Even more dangerous is the possibility that improper ventilation
in a house can lead to backdrafting, in which carbon-monoxide
exhaust from combustion appliances like furnaces or gas water
heaters are sucked into the living space rather than going up the
chimney.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   About a year and a half ago, the building at 34 Ditmars St. in
Bushwick, Brooklyn, was little more than an empty, crumbling shell.
Today it is a showpiece for what is possible when a remodeling
strategy is developed using thoughtful energy-efficient design.
</P>
<P>
   Using grant money from the Joyce Mertz Gillmore Foundation and
the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and
Development, Ms. Benedict recently rehabilitated the Ditmars Street
house and 17 other vacant, deteriorated multifamily buildings. In
each she incorporated state-of-the-art energy-saving construction
and design techniques while keeping her budget as close as possible
to the budget for an ordinary renovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The energy-efficiency elements of the project ended up adding
about 1 percent to the total cost,'' Ms. Benedict said. ``And I
believe that as this kind of construction becomes more common, we
can do even better.''
</P>
<P>
   The building at 34 Ditmars St. is a three-story, six-unit frame
structure that was built about 100 years ago. Once drafty, noisy
and inefficiently heated, the building is now tight, quiet and far
more energy efficient than it was even when it was new.
</P>
<P>
   Every exterior wall, Ms. Benedict said, is superinsulated with
densely packed, blown-in cellulose _ another name for finely
shredded newspapers; every electrical outlet and switch box is
caulked to prevent drafts from seeping in from behind the walls;
every piece of sheetrock is screwed and glued to the studs and
sealed at both floor and ceiling, creating a nearly airtight
envelope around each apartment; every window is insulated and
double-glazed and set in frames that are sealed airtight with
caulk; every room has its own heating element and every heating
element has its own thermostat, making it possible to take
energy-saving advantage of the heat produced by sunlight in the
living room or by the stove top in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   And while Ms. Benedict's rehabilitation work is on a grander
scale than most home-improvement projects _ the $4.3 million
project involved the gut-renovation of all 18 multifamily buildings
_ the design and construction techniques used in the project can be
employed in virtually any home where there is a renovation being
planned and the will to plan it properly.
</P>
<P>
   A homeowner who is planning to re-sheetrock a room or two, for
example, can use that opportunity to insulate any uninsulated
exterior walls and seal around electrical outlets and switch boxes
with caulk. In fact, Ms. Benedict said, any time the interior
framing of an exterior wall is exposed, it is a good idea to use
expanding urethane foam to seal any holes through which wires or
pipes pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Air is smart,'' she said. ``If there's a hole to move through,
air will find it.''
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners replacing windows, for example, should settle for
nothing less than double-glazed, argon-filled windows with a
low-emittance _ or low-e _ coating. Argon-filled double-glazing,
Ms. Benedict said, has far more insulating ability than
single-glazed windows. And the low-e coating, she said, can
regulate the amount of heat from the sun entering the room, while
keeping heat inside the room from radiating out.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Benedict said that even home-improvement projects as modest
as the repainting of a few rooms presents an opportunity to enhance
comfort and efficiency by insulating the exterior walls of the
rooms being repainted. That can be done without significantly
disturbing the interior wall surfaces, she said, by using blown-in
cellulose.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, Ms. Benedict said, cellulose insulation is injected
into the wall cavity through holes cut in the spaces between the
studs. The equipment used to blow the cellulose typically remains
outside the house, and the holes can be patched relatively easily
after the insulation is in place.
</P>
<P>
   One of the advantages of using densely-packed cellulose, Ms.
Benedict said, is that unlike fiberglass _ which insulates well but
does little to stop air circulation _ packed cellulose can
virtually eliminate air movement through the wall being insulated.
The cost for blown-in insulation, Ms. Benedict said, averages about
$1 a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   If superinsulating the exterior walls of a house with densely
packed, blown-in cellulose is not practical, it is nevertheless
possible to reduce unwanted air infiltration by plugging whatever
holes may be accessible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best locations for reducing overall leakage are often
found at the top and bottom of the house,'' said David Keefe, an
energy-efficiency consultant in Fairfax, Vt. ``Leaks at the top of
the building, where air usually goes out, often cause condensation
problems. And leaks at the bottom can carry moisture, radon _ or
whatever else is in the soil gas _ into the house.''
</P>
<P>
   A common site for leaks in a house, Keefe said, is the attic
floor. Problem areas include the spaces around plumbing vent
stacks, holes for electrical conduits, chases around chimneys, gaps
around ductwork and the open tops of interior partitions.
Accordingly, Keefe said, homeowners converting an attic into living
space have an ideal opportunity to make important improvements that
will pay significant dividends.
</P>
<P>
   First, he said, all sources of air penetration into the living
space should be sealed with expanding urethane foam before
installing floors or walls that will make future access difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Next, and even more important, he said, is to determine the
``thermal envelope'' of the area. The thermal envelope, he said, is
the insulative boundary between the heated area of a house _
typically the living area _ and the unheated portion.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   During an attic renovation project, he said, it is common for
homeowners to install short ``knee walls'' between the attic floor
and the sloped roof. If that is done, Keefe said, it is advisable
to include within the thermal envelope the triangular space created
by the knee walls outside the new living space.
</P>
<P>
   That is done by insulating from the bottom of the roof to where
it meets the knee wall and then over the top of the living space
and across to the other side of the roof.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Keefe said, care should be taken to provide a way
for air to circulate through the vents in the soffits (the exterior
underside of the roof where it extends beyond the exterior walls of
the building) along the underside of the rafters and then out
through a vent in the peak of the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Proper circulation, he said, will not only keep the living space
cooler in summer but will also aid in the prevention of ice dams _
a fairly common problem that can cause serious damage to a house.
</P>
<P>
   Ice dams form, Keefe said, when a poorly insulated roof allows
heat from the house to melt snow on the roof surface. As the runoff
trickles down the roof it eventually gets to the uninsulated eaves
at the edge of the roof and refreezes. Then, as more snow melts,
the runoff begins to back up under the shingles, where it can leak
through the roof surface or even trickle down into the exterior
walls.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to prevent ice dams, Keefe said, is to keep the
roof uniformly cold with proper insulation.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners who are reshingling their roofs, however, can take
some extra precautions against the damage caused by ice dams by
installing a waterproof membrane under the shingles part way up the
roof.
</P>
<P>
   Corey McIsaac, supervisor of technical information services for
GAF, a roofing-materials manufacturer based in Wayne, N.J., said
that roof membranes should be installed at least 24 inches beyond
the interior wall line.
</P>
<P>
   Just as roofs need fresh air to stay healthy, so do the
occupants of a building.
</P>
<P>
   In the Ditmars Street property renovated by Ms. Benedict, for
example, the techniques used to insulate the building and seal
every possible source of outside air infiltration made proper
ventilation a necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``A leaky building will have between one and two full air
changes each hour,'' Ms. Benedict said, referring to the rate at
which inside air is replaced by outside air in a building. ``Our
buildings have only one-third to one-half an air change per hour,''
she said, explaining that to achieve that rate, the ventilation
fans in the kitchens and bathrooms run at low speeds 24 hours a
day.
</P>
<P>
   And rather than have replacement air being supplied through a
multitude of holes and leaks, Ms. Benedict said, fresh air admitted
into her buildings comes through ``trickle vents'' installed over
the windows in the bedrooms. Such vents, she said, are equipped
with screens and mechanical louvers that allow only a measured flow
of air into the room, keeping out wind and insects. Of course, no
energy-efficient renovation project would be complete without
installation of the most cost-efficient heating system possible.
For that, Ms. Benedict contacted Henry Gifford, president of
Gifford Fuel Saving, a Manhattan heating-and-ventilation design
consulting company.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing Gifford did was calculate how much heat was
going to be needed in the building by figuring out how much was
likely to be lost. In the Ditmars Street project, Gifford said, the
three-story, six-unit building was so tightly sealed against heat
loss that he was able to install a high-efficiency,
sealed-combustion gas boiler with a capacity of only 90,000 BTU _
about one-third of what would normally be installed in a building
that size.
</P>
<P>
   The boiler burns so efficiently, Gifford said, that it can be
vented directly through the exterior wall of the building _ like an
ordinary gas clothes dryer. And rather than drawing the air needed
for combustion from inside the building, it draws the air from
outside, through an intake pipe that extends through the exterior
wall.
</P>
<P>
   That means there is essentially no potential for backdrafting,''
he said, adding that such a system was almost always preferable to
drawing combustion air from inside the house and venting exhaust
gases up the chimney.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to heating the house, Gifford said, the boiler also
heats the domestic water for the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We installed an 80-gallon, stainless-steel hot-water tank,''
he said, explaining that unlike conventional water heaters, which
use combustion or electricity to heat water in the tank, the system
he installed uses heat produced by the boiler.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a coil from the boiler running through the tank,'' he
said. ``The hot water in the coil heats up the water in the tank
and then circulates back to the boiler.''
</P>
<P>
   The tank is wrapped in an insulating jacket to minimize heat
loss and is guaranteed for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it'll probably last even longer than that, because there's
no fire in it to burn it out,'' Gifford said.
</P>
<P>
   When everything is taken into consideration, he said, the $1,200
high-efficiency boiler added about $300 to the cost of the heating
system, an amount that should be recovered in fuel savings in a
year or two.
</P>
<P>
   Another energy-saving feature used in the building _ and one
that homeowners installing new heating systems might want to
consider _ is a hot-water baseboard heating unit, with its own
thermostat _ one in every room.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means that there is absolutely no overheating or
underheating of individual rooms,'' he said, explaining that the
thermostats on each heating unit, which are calibrated to account
for being near the floor rather than higher up, allow for
individualized room settings that help save energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when it's sunny all day on one side of the house, and
windy all night on the other, the heat load always stays even,'' he
said, adding that each thermostat added about $35 to the cost of
the baseboard heating units. ``I would say it's worth $35 a room to
be comfortable for as long as you own your house,'' he said.

REAL ESTATE: BLACK ATLANTA BUILDERS AIM AT HIGH END
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)   (jw) 
 By TIM O'REILEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The first residents have begun to move into two new
subdivisions in metropolitan Atlanta in which African-American
developers are marketing homes in largely black neighborhoods to
upper-income buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Prices start at $300,000 for a new house on a lot at Sandstone
Estates, a 48-lot subdivision in the suburb of Lithonia in DeKalb
County about 12 miles east of downtown Atlanta. And at Legacy
Hills, in the town of Riverdale in Fayette County 12 miles south of
downtown, the lowest price for a house in what will be a 63-lot
development is $350,000.
</P>
<P>
   The third quarter median price for houses in Riverdale was
$85,000 and for Lithonia it was $102,900, according to Smart Number
Analysis, a market-data-research firm in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   So far there are 50 lot buyers at the two subdivisions, and 15
houses have been built or are in construction. The most expensive
is expected to cost more than $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   The buyers have been black professionals and their families, and
the development companies are owned and run by black entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Legacy Hills, the developer is Wayne Kendall, a
lawyer who is embarking on his first land-development venture.
Three builders have been approved to construct houses for people
who buy his lots. At Sandstone Estates, the developer is a
partnership led by an experienced home-building contractor, Earl
Thomas, and Greg Baranco, the owner of three new-car dealerships in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The two projects are the latest in a long line of predominantly
black residential subdivisions in metropolitan Atlanta, but the
earlier projects have usually been developed by whites. What is
rare, even in Atlanta, is the presence of black home builders,
putting up the equity and attracting the necessary institutional
financing to do subdivisions for high-end buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of Atlanta, in my experience, I know of no community
where the principal target market would be African-American
buyers,'' said William Webb, a marketing consultant based in Amelia
Island, Fla., who is president of the Institute of Residential
Marketing, an affiliate of the National Association of Home
Builders. ``Generally, developers will envision a market where the
demographic characteristics include everything but ethnicity.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled that the lawyers at the association had carefully
vetted an article advocating ethnic marketing that he had written
for an association magazine before allowing its publication. He
said that legal actions against real estate agents who have
attempted to steer white clients away from black areas have made
agents leery of mentioning race at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are trying to stop illegal discrimination, that's a step
in the right direction,'' he said. ``But another step is to
recognize ethnic and cultural differences and to cater to them.
There's nothing wrong with that.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lack of financing poses the biggest obstacle to building
single-family developments, said Danny Brown, the managing partner
in charge of sales at Legacy Hills and one of its investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you come into a project without a lot of development
experience, banks tend not to want to give you money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In both Legacy Hills and Sandstone Estates, developers have
limited their need for capital by limiting their roles. They have
bought the property, built the streets and installed utilities. But
then they sell vacant lots rather than build the houses themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The homes must follow specific design guidelines. At Legacy
Hills, for example, exterior walls must be entirely made of stone,
brick or stucco, and the first two floors must have at least 3,500
square feet of space. Buyers are given the names of approved
contractors from which to choose. At Sandstone Estates, Thomas, one
of the developers, is also one of the contractors building houses
for lot purchasers.
</P>
<P>
   For at least one buyer, the fact that the developer is black
provided one of the incentives to buy in the subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   Degas Wright, the 35-year-old treasurer of the Metropolitan
Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, and his wife, Dr. Patricia
Braz-Wright, a physician, who have two children, built a house at
Sandstone Estates last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Wright said that his decision to buy had been influenced by the
hope that the developer's success would help strengthen the black
community in southeastern DeKalb County and its business base. He
also said that he wanted to raise his children in a neighborhood
where they will come into contact with successful blacks every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty years ago, 20 years ago, we probably would have had to
move into a majority white neighborhood to get the kind of home we
wanted,'' Wright said. ``Now, it is not necessary to move in with
white families to say that we've made it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sandstone Estates traces its origins to about a decade ago when
Baranco, the car dealer, yearned to live in an estate-style home in
southeastern DeKalb County. At the time, he lived there and there
were no subdivisions for well-to-do home buyers.
</P>
<P>
   He found that neither developers nor lenders had any interest in
building high-end homes in the area. But when several of his
neighbors also expressed interest in moving to better homes there,
his wife, Juanita, suggested that they become do-it-yourself
developers.
</P>
<P>
   After finding little interest among lenders, Baranco put his
dealerships up as collateral to finance a 23-lot development called
Sandstone Shores, along a small lake. Sandstone Shores sold out all
of its 23 lots. Baranco has had his own home there for the last
eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Baranco said he had not initially planned to target blacks,
since the area was largely white at the time. ``We thought maybe
there would be some interest in white people moving there, but it
just didn't happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It came as a disappointment to the Sandstone Shores owners that
several plans to build high-priced housing on neighboring land
never came to fruition. ``Reluctantly, we decided to do Sandstone
Estates,'' he said. Thomas and two other neighbors were recruited
to put up seed capital.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Jamaica, Thomas had moved to Atlanta when his wife,
an aerospace executive, was transferred from New York in 1989. He
not only built homes in other high-end subdivisions, but he also
engaged in other facets of home-building, such as working for
roofing and siding companies.
</P>
<P>
   Financing was easier for Sandstone Estates because Baranco sat
on the board of directors of First Southern Bank, which supplied a
loan. First Southern has since merged into Citizens Trust Bank,
based in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Close to $2 million has been invested in the 142-acre Sandstone
Estates to prepare 48 house lots on 142 acres of land for home
construction. Three houses are completed and six others are under
way. Through a word-of-mouth marketing drive that Thomas has
conducted wherever he has built homes, 34 of the lots have been
sold in two years, all to black buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We attract black professionals who do not want to move to the
north side of town,'' said Thomas, referring to the locale of
several of the region's most affluent suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   While the advertising for the 243-acre Legacy Hills has been
aimed at all upper-income buyers, Brown, the managing partner in
charge of sales, said that ``the marketing effort is geared to a
market base that happens to be African-American.''
</P>
<P>
   The project, which may include a golf course, eventually secured
financing from Colonial Bank, based in Montgomery, Ala., and
Kendall built streets, installed utilities and put 24 lots on the
market last September. Sixteen have been sold solely to black home
buyers, and six homes have been built.
</P>
<P>
   The plans for an 18-hole golf course have fallen behind
schedule, Brown said, but he added that he hoped it would open in
the spring of 2000.

odds with officials over whether his dog, Lady Harley, a Siberian

the first three cases, winning each time partly because the
language of the vehicle code, which prohibits unsafe riding by

OHIO STATE OVERCOMES ITS WOLVERINE NEMESIS, 31-16 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ It was early in the fourth quarter and Ohio
State was leading Michigan, 31-16. Normally, that is a secure lead.
</P>
<P>
   But in this fierce rivalry any lead by Ohio State with time
still remaining on the clock must be considered tenuous. For the
94,339 people in attendance at Ohio Stadium, this is when it gets
interesting. Would the Buckeyes collapse and allow Michigan a
chance to break their hearts once more? Or would Ohio State be able
to preserve its lead and walk away with a precious victory?
</P>
<P>
   Two Michigan touchdowns and two 2-point conversions and the
Wolverines would win.
</P>
<P>
   But there would be no high drama Saturday. No single player
stealing the show and acting as Michigan's savior, the way
cornerback Charles Woodson against did against the Buckeyes last
year with a punt return for a touchdown and an interception in the
end zone. Instead, Ohio State (10-1) held on to defeat Michigan
(8-3), 31-16, and help Buckeyes coach John Cooper exorcise some of
his Wolverine demons.
</P>
<P>
   The big star Saturday was Ohio State receiver David Boston, who
broke his team record for most receptions in a season by catching
10 passes for 217 yards and two touchdowns. Boston set the team
record last year with 73 catches. His 10 receptions Saturday gave
him 74 for the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes had lost three consecutive games to Michigan and
were 1-4-1 in the past six meetings. Michigan coach Lloyd Carr had
never lost a game to Ohio State in his four-year tenure with the
Wolverines, but his counterpart, Cooper, had proved he could beat
everyone but Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the game, his overall record was 95-33-1 in 11 years at
Ohio State. But Cooper was 1-8-1 against the Wolverines. This was
another opportunity for Cooper to beat back that maize-and-blue
misery that has haunted him in his tenure at Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   The game matched Michigan's defense, ranked No. 1 nationally
against the run (yielding 73.7 yards a game) against Ohio State's
rushing attack, which leads the Big 10 with an average of 205 yards
a game.
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes ignored that advantage on their first series and
had quarterback Joe Germaine throw the ball. But Germaine was so
filled with adrenaline that his first three passes soared over the
heads of his receivers. His first pass on the next series slipped
from his hand as his arm came forward. When the Buckeyes decided to
go to the ground they found success: Running back Michael Wiley
ripped off a 53-yard run for a touchdown the second time he touched
the ball. That helped give Ohio State a quick 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes added to that lead by taking advantage of a
Wolverines' mistake on special teams. Michigan punter Jason Vinson
had the punt snap sail through his hands and when he picked it up,
he tried to punt it anyway. The ball, which was originally spotted
at the Wolverines' 29, sailed out of bounds at their 16. The punt
was minus 13 yards and the Buckeyes were in great shape. Germaine
found receiver Dee Miller streaking across the middle on a crossing
pattern for a touchdown on a 16-yard, third-down pass play that
helped give Ohio State a 14-0 lead with 9:44 to play in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Vinson had more problems punting in the second quarter when his
kick was blocked by Ohio State free safety Derek Ross. The ball was
recovered at the 20 by Ohio State running back Jonathan Wells.
Germaine connected with Boston, who had seven receptions for 142
yards in the first half, on a 30-yard touchdown pass play that
helped give Ohio State a 21-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Ohio State defense had manhandled the Wolverines
offense for much of the first half, Michigan was not about to let
the Buckeyes go into the locker room at halftime feeling
comfortable. The Wolverines put together a nine-play, 80 yard drive
in 2:38, scoring with 35 seconds to play in the half on a
three-yard pass from quarterback Tom Brady to receiver Tai Streets
to make it 21-10. Just a reminder to the Buckeyes that this game
was not over yet.
</P>
<P>
   But the Buckeyes demonstrated their big-play ability on offense
in the second half. Germaine and Boston hooked up on a 43-yard
touchdown pass that helped give Ohio State a 28-10 lead with 9:51
to play in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And Ohio State set up a 39-yard field goal by kicker Dan Stutlz
on a 49-yard pass from Germaine to fullback Matt Keller. That field
goal made it 31-13 with 1:36 to play in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That maize-and-blue haze around Cooper was finally beginning to
lift.

GAILEY, REEVES SHARE WINNING ROOTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ When Chan Gailey needed an NFL job, Dan
Reeves came through. When Gailey needed a recommendation, Reeves
came through again. &QL; 
When Reeves needed a friend in Denver, Gailey was there. But at the
same time, Gailey remained tight with Mike Shanahan and John Elway,
who were not friends of Reeves. &QL; 
When the NFL kicks off Week 12 today, the combined record of teams
coached by Shanahan, Reeves and Gailey will be 25-5. Which speaks
highly of the Broncos' staff of the late '80s. &QL; 
But in the Broncos, Shanahan has the defending Super Bowl champion,
so even 10-0 is not a big surprise. At 8-2 in Atlanta, Reeves is
the leading candidate for coach of the year. ``Absolutely,'' agreed
Gailey, who might get some votes himself since the Cowboys are
7-3. &QL; 
Thus far, however, the biggest winner in the NFL is the small
Georgia town of Americus. &QL; 
Need a coach? Go to Americus. &QL; 
``Chan looked exactly like Opie Taylor,'' Reeves said last week,
recalling his high school days in Americus as a summer-league
baseball coach for grade schoolers. ``But I don't know if Opie
could play. Chan could.'' &QL; 
Americus being the hometown of two current NFL coaches (combined
record, 15-5) is rather unique. ``Must have been something in the
water,'' Gailey said. &QL; 
But as the Cowboys approach a critical point in the schedule
(Seattle today and Minnesota on Thursday), Gailey has a quick reply
for his coaching career having reached this stage. ``Dan Reeves
provided the foundation for where I am today,'' he said. ``I will
be forever indebted to Dan.'' &QL; 
Gailey, eight years younger than Reeves, got his first NFL coaching
chance because of Reeves. &QL; 
``Only now, being a head coach, do I fully realize how much guts it
took for him to hire me in Denver,'' said Gailey, who joined the
Broncos staff in 1985 as special teams coach. ``I was a wishbone
coach from Troy State, who had nothing but a defensive background
in coaching. But I told Dan I wanted to learn NFL offense. And he
let me.'' &QL; 
Offense was and is the specialty of Reeves, of Shanahan, who was
Reeves' offensive coordinator, and, of course, of Elway. ``I walked
into a pretty good learning opportunity,'' said Gailey, smiling. &QL; 
Reeves admits the Americus connection helped Gailey land that first
NFL job. ``But most hires in this business are because of people
you are familiar with,'' he added. ``I knew Chan. I knew his father
and his family. I knew what I was getting. I didn't have any doubts
about him.'' &QL; 
In Denver, Gailey worked and watched and learned. An on-going
subplot there was the strained relationship Shanahan and Elway had
with Reeves. &QL; 
``That's something I don't talk about,'' Gailey said. ``Things
happen in this business, and then they build over time. But
everyone involved is a fine person, despite the differences that
developed. It wasn't like a bad guy and good guy kind of thing.'' &QL; 
As the head coach, Reeves was the focal point. With the future
ambition of holding such a job in the NFL, Gailey took mental
notes. &QL; 
``What I came away with was all the things Dan did really, really
well, and then there were things where I said, `OK, I'd have
handled that differently,' &UR; '' Gailey added. ``Dan is very
demanding, no doubt about it.'' &QL; 
Funny, that's the way the portfolio on Jerry Jones also reads. &QL; 
And when Jones developed a sudden interest in January in Gailey as
a head coaching candidate, he obviously wanted a recommendation
from Reeves. &QL; 
``We were in Indianapolis \Rat the scouting combine\S and Jerry
wanted to talk to me,'' Reeves said. ``I had read the names on his
list and heard the rumors, and then suddenly he mentioned Chan. I
was suprised. &QL; 
``But I told him that this was a good person, a solid coach, and
someone who would be perfect for that franchise. The one thing
about Chan is he could work with Jerry. Chan is not an ego guy at
all. I stressed that to Jerry.'' &QL; 
The question about Gailey, since answered, was would he be tough
enough to bring discipline to a team desperately lacking in it? &QL; 
``I never had a doubt,'' Reeves said. ``Chan is from Americus.
Everybody from Americus is tough.'' &QL; 
Going into today's NFL games, head coaches from Americus are also
winning. &QL;

DARK DAYS FOR GREEN BAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE FISHER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The Death Watch lingers, and hovers, like an
ominous fog that you cannot touch or smell or taste. Yet its
presence is undeniable.
</P>
<P>
   The Death Watch first suggested itself in the off-season, and
then took definitive form on a chilly Monday night in Wisconsin,
and then floated darkly to suburban Detroit, and a few weeks later,
made its presence felt on another Monday night, in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   And today, The Death Watch has tickets on the 50-yard line of
the Metrodome in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers, pronounces safety LeRoy Butler, look for ``an
opportunity to show the world we're an elite team.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler could be right. After all, if the 7-3 Packers upset the
9-1 Minnesota Vikings, the NFC Central title, and maybe home-field
edge in the NFC playoffs, is again a coin flip _ and The Death
Watch might have been knocking on the door of the erstwhile champs
prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   But The Death Watch doesn't hang around where it doesn't belong.
And for as often as it has tailed the 1998 Packers, The Death Watch
might as well be given a locker at Green Bay headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In part because of the expectations we all have,'' says coach
Mike Holmgren, ``this year has at times been a struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   It probably started immediately after Super Bowl XXXII, when the
Packers were stunned by two-touchdown underdog Denver. Green Bay
had fully expected a second consecutive world championship, and the
loss triggered instant tumult. The crises, in chronological order:
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren spent the off-season examining an escape from his
contract to become Seattle's coach and general manager. The Packers
stifled his bid, but conceded by giving Holmgren an escape clause
after this season that would allow him to leave for a similar dual
role. Because of that, rumors are everywhere that Holmgren's 1999
home will be in Cleveland or San Diego or Seattle or Washington or
who knows where?
</P>
<P>
   Then team spokesman Reggie White spoke. His off-season address
to the Wisconsin state legislature ripped homosexuality and
virtually every ethnic group in America. GM Ron Wolf tried to cap
the ensuing firestorm by saying of White, ``I believe everyone is
entitled to an opinion. But sometimes it's time to shut your
mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   But the damage to the organization that had long claimed it, not
the Cowboys, deserved to be ``America's Team,'' was done.
</P>
<P>
   Then came personnel problems. Defensive stars Eugene Robinson,
Doug Evans and Gabe Wilkins departed via free agency. White flirted
with retirement. Quarterback Brett Favre, whose addictive
personality could be a time bomb, has thrown 19 TD passes but also
16 interceptions and keeps saying that he considers retirement
after every loss. And when running back Dorsey Levens broke his leg
in Week 2, the Packers' roster was thinner than it's been in five
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Week 5 loss to Minnesota, a 37-24 decision at previously
fortress-secure Lambeau Field, was a debacle. But at least the
Vikings were recognized as a worthy foe and a potential threat to
the Packers' division throne. In Week 6, Green Bay was defeated,
27-20, by the Lions and their rookie quarterback, Charlie Batch.
</P>
<P>
   The back-to-back losses spoiled a 4-0 start, and another 27-20
loss, this one at Pittsburgh, made the Packers seem poised to
deliver their own eulogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think \Rthe loss to the Vikings\S lingered only because it
was so unusual,'' Holmgren said. ``That was an unusual set of
circumstances. \RBut\S they won fair and square. And now we have
another crack at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay is reaching the final leg of a demanding three-game
road swing. The Packers were at Pittsburgh, were at the Giants last
week, and now oppose a Vikings team that has lost just once at home
to the Packers since Denny Green and Holmgren became head coaches
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In this decade, NFL teams have played three consecutive road
games 60 times. Only 18 teams have emerged with winning marks, with
35 of the teams finishing 1-2 _ which is what Green Bay faces if it
loses.
</P>
<P>
   Favre is on record as saying San Francisco, a 36-22 loser to
Green Bay, is a better team than the Vikings. Green is on record as
saying he's not certain anybody in Green Bay has earned the right
to disrespect his Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at our track record over the years, against every
team, I think we've shown well for ourselves,'' Green says, ``And
that's been especially true in our meetings with Green Bay. We're
happy with the way we match up.''
</P>
<P>
   History says Green has room to talk; the standings say he also
has room to breathe. If Minnesota does lose, the Vikings
nevertheless would have a one-game lead with five to play. But if
Green Bay loses, the Packers are three games back with five to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we can play,'' Favre says. ``When we put it together,
we can roll as well as anybody. It's just frustrating, tough to put
a finger on, when we don't play like we can.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not a mystery. It's The Death Watch.

A TEAM NEAR FULL MEASURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys are only two-and-a-half seasons
removed from winning an unprecedented third world championship in
four years.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen current starters have at least one Super Bowl ring. Ten
have all three.
</P>
<P>
   They begin play at Texas Stadium today against the talented
Seattle Seahawks with a two-game lead on their nearest NFC East
competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the prevailing theory is these same Cowboys have something
to prove. Though this club is vastly improved from Barry Switzer's
final days, the season has not produced a victory over a team that
currently has a winning record.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Irvin hears this theory, grits his teeth, and curses for
emphasis. The Cowboys, Irvin said, should not use today, or
Thursday's game against the Minnesota Vikings, as a barometer to
measure where they stand among the league's elite. He then contends
this veteran team has enough championship mettle that a record
eighth Super Bowl appearance should not be viewed as a preposterous
proposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Measuring stick? I don't buy into that measuring stick,'' he
exclaimed. ``We don't need to line up against another team to find
out where we are as far as a measuring stick. We've got a whole lot
of guys here that have won a lot of big games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is anybody on this team that thinks that we can't
beat any team by playing our game and not making crucial mistakes
in the crucial moments then they don't need to be on this football
team because they are a poison and that's the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Irvin, Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman scowls at those who
don't think this club can reach over its most recent past to claim
one more title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing that maybe we are not respected as we once
were,'' Aikman said. ``That's upsetting to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't blame anyone for thinking that based on what took
place last year and the way that we played. I still think we're a
talented football team and still think we can compete at the level
we once did.''
</P>
<P>
   Team owner Jerry Jones has stopped short of proclaiming his team
is all the way back. But he points out correctly that the Cowboys
have more balance than any of the NFC's top teams. Two-time
defending NFC champion Green Bay has no running game. San Francisco
is soft in the offensive line and the secondary. Minnesota and
Atlanta lack a championship pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   Statistically, the Cowboys have proved they are among the best
teams in the NFC. They lead the conference in fewest points
allowed, and are one behind Atlanta for the NFC lead in turnover
margin at plus-8.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the Cowboys (341.7 yards per game) are fourth in
the conference in total offense behind San Francisco (420.1),
Minnesota (382) and Green Bay (348).
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks coach Dennis Erickson, whose 5-5 team is the most
talented the Cowboys have faced since Week 2 at Denver, sees a
star-studded Cowboys roster, and all but wonders if this isn't the
team to beat in the NFC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chan has done a tremendous job of getting them ready and they
are playing like they used to _ with great confidence,'' Erickson
said. ``Emmitt \RSmith\S is running well, and Troy, I think, is one
of the best quarterbacks in the NFL. With Deion \RSanders\S, they
are playing great team defense. They are pretty close to the
\RCowboys\S teams of old.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith hears this theory and has the
same reaction as Irvin and Aikman. Smith relishes the underdog
status. If San Francisco, Green Bay, and Minnesota want to
underrate the Cowboys, let them, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no. Keep us where we are,'' he said. ``We are just going
about our business very quietly, winning games. We're not asking
for extra attention. If you guys want to throw us in a category
with a group of teams you consider elite, then that's your
business.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Irvin requests, leave the measuring sticks at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need to beat this team to prove to me that I can do
something, or lose to prove that I can't,'' he said. ``I don't need
any team to be a measuring stick. I already found out what it takes
to win, and I found that out over the last eight or nine years of
my career.''  &LR; tagtop:Kevin Lyons, (817) 390-7760

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Craig Ludwig says his souped up snowmobile
does 121 mph.
</P>
<P>
   And the Stars defenseman said his tricked out Chevy Blazer might
be even faster, ``but it's really not for speed. I use that more to
run over things.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his customized Harley-Davidson motorcycle, he'd really
rather not say how fast that's gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be some legal issues involved there,'' he says
with a knowing nod.
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig jokes he hasn't mentally advanced much past the age of
17, he's simply acquired better toys. But at age 37, that makes him
uniquely qualified in at least one area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a pretty good hold on what's going through the head of
a 17-year-old kid,'' he said. ``Heck, I've got 20 years of
experience at it. So if they have any questions, they should come
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   With an opportunity to play big brother, Ludwig has spearheaded
a unique fundraiser for the Happy Hill Farm in Granbury, a home for
troubled youth. Today, Ludwig and his business partner Ron Buckbaum
will be leaders of the pack for the first David McDavid Auto Group
Turkey Ride &AMP; Poker Run.
</P>
<P>
   Motorcyle riders will gather at the David McDavid Acura
dealership in Plano at 8 a.m. and then set out on a day-long ride
across the area, stopping at checkpoints to pick up playing cards
and trying to assemble the best poker hands, which will be redeemed
for prizes. The ride will end in the afternoon at the David McDavid
Auto Group in Irving, with a dinner party and carnival that runs
from 11 a.m. until 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig assures no laws will be broken in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, we've got to set a good example,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig has the experience to make himself an example. Growing up
in Eagle River, Wis., he wasn't above a little juvenile
delinquency. Let's just say the city police knew him by name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did my time,'' he said defiantly.
</P>
<P>
   But each time he messed up, Ludwig said someone was there to
pick him up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got myself into all kinds of trouble when I was a kid,''
Ludwig said. ``But every time I did, every time when it could have
been worse, I had my mom and dad there to straighten me out. My dad
is one of the toughest disciplinarians you'll ever see, but he knew
I needed that back then.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, there were teachers and counselors in high school
who helped him gain an athletic scholarship to the University of
North Dakota, where he helped the Fighting Sioux to the 1980 NCAA
championship and made enough of an impression to get drafted by the
Montreal Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for a few adults, I'd never have gone to school
and I wouldn't be here right now,'' Ludwig said.
</P>
<P>
   He'd like to impart the same lessons to the children at Happy
Hill Farm. The working farm houses about 100 youth aged 5-18, who
live, work and study there. It's a place where they can receive a
second chance, Ludwig said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And sometimes they might need a third chance or a fourth
chance,'' he said. ``You can't give up on kids, because you never
know what their potential is, who they might turn out to be if you
help them.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckbaum said more than 500 riders have registered and would
like to get more than 1,000. With the carnival attracting
non-riders, the fundraiser could pull in anywhere between $5,000
and $10,000 for Happy Hill Farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind of charity he can relate to,'' said Guy
Carbonneau, who is expected to join Ludwig and Stars teammates
Derian Hatcher and Darryl Sydor on the ride.
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig's role on the Stars requires him to provide similar
leadership. An alternate captain and one of three remaining players
who moved with the team from Minnesota in 1993 _ Hatcher and Mike
Modano are the others _ Ludwig doesn't necessarily lead by example.
He purposely lives in Colleyville, away from teammates, and often
is one of the first to leave the StarCenter after practice. He also
interacts with the team as much as any player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luds is funny in that he wants his privacy, but he's also the
guy who gets us all worked up,'' Carbonneau said. ``He's the one
who plans the Halloween party. He's the one who runs the football
pool. He knows how to keep us all interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Younger players in particular have sought his
sunglasses-and-leather form of leadership and tried to keep up with
his high-speed exploits away from the rink. And Ludwig takes
seriously the responsibility of being a role model to players like
25-year-old Matvichuk.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past couple of years, that's become even more important
to me,'' Ludwig said. ``I think it first hit me with Matty. I mean
this guy can be a great player, and I didn't want to mess that
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Matvichuk calls Ludwig a strong role model.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a big brother to me since I broke into the league,''
Matvichuk said. ``I don't agree with anyone who says he isn't a
leader because of what he does off the ice. He's played 16 years in
this league and he showed me the ropes. I think you can tell by the
style I play that I reflected off of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, a young Ludwig received that same kind of leadership
on the Montreal Canadiens from a player with a wild streak of his
own. That player was Bob Gainey, now the Stars' general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a point where you have information that other people
don't have and you want to be able to share that,'' Gainey said.
``For you to be able to give advice to someone who is 22 or 23,
advice that they can use, it's a good feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig, in fact, would like to impart some of his hard-earned
wisdom to the youth at Happy Hill Farm. You could say he looks at
this motorcyle ride as a case of follow the leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine there are times when the kids aren't happy with
where they're at, but it's great that we have places like that,
places that can give discipline,'' he said. ``If I could just take
a crystal ball and hold it up for these kids and show them what
they could be doing 10 years from now, how much difference there
can be in their lives from the things that happen when they're 17,
they'd see that they can make the right decisions and things can
work out right.''

THIRTY-FIVE YEARS LATER, ASSASSINATION MEMORIES ARE STILL SHARP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON: President Kennedy's death. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Connally placed her notes in a file drawer and did not refer to
them until 1993, when the Sixth Floor Museum in the old School Book
Depository was to be dedicated. The notes are now at the Lyndon B.
Johnson Library in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The 30th anniversary of the assassination was her first trip to
Dealey Plaza since that fateful day. It was a time made more
poignant because John Connally had died that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it out and it was good,'' she said of her notes. ``I
was surprised that it was so easy to write what I was thinking. I
didn't write them for you or the country. I wrote them for all the
future generations of Connallys. I wanted them to know what their
grandmother, their great-grandmother felt.''
</P>
<P>
   The diary notes are indelibly etched in her memory.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled the scene at Parkland when John Connally was taken
to Emergency Room 2 and the president was rushed into Emergency
Room 1. Nellie Connally waited in a small room adjacent to the one
occupied by her husband. There were no windows; for her, no outside
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was preoccupied with the recovery of John Connally,'' she
said. ``I wanted him to live and I wanted them to find the person
who did this terrible thing. It's hard to believe something like
this happened in our country. It bothers me that the president was
assassinated in my state. We had a tough time getting through
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Connally said she had little rest that weekend despite being
given sleeping pills by doctors. She said she was shocked when she
saw her husband on life support, tubes protruding from his arms and
legs. There were concerns even when surgeons said he was out of
danger and moved him to a two-room suite, with one room reserved
for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``They covered the windows with 3-inch steel in my bedroom,
too,'' she said. ``They painted other windows in the building
black. That terrified me more. For the first time in my life, I was
worried about the safety of my family. It occurred to me that it
would be easy to hurt us. The governor used to say, `You can escape
a lot of things, but you can't escape a gun.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the hours after the shootings, she talked to Defense
Secretary Robert McNamara and to Lyndon Johnson, a family friend
and the new president. She did not have a chance to speak to
Jacqueline Kennedy. But her son, John B. Connally III, then 17,
persuaded Nellie Connally to write a note he would deliver to the
Kennedys at the president's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Nellie Connally stayed at her husband's side at Parkland.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the funeral, the Kennedys stopped their car when they
saw Mr. Johnson, and got out to talk to the president,'' she said.
``My son, John, gave Jackie the note I wrote, and Jackie told him,
`John, the one good thing to come out of this is that your father
will live.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Connally said she cannot remember what she wrote in her note,
but 10 days later, she received ``a very sweet note'' from
Jacqueline Kennedy, who died of cancer May 19, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   She is amused and bewildered by Americans' continued interest in
the assassination, fueled by movies such as Oliver Stone's
``J.F.K.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every November my phone starts ringing,'' she said. ``The
calls used to be for John Connally, but I'm all that's left of the
four principals in that car. I don't know why they call. I haven't
changed my story for 35 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she continues to grant interviews and share her account
of Nov. 22 with print and broadcast media, as well as with
audiences on occasional speaking engagements she makes around the
state. She doesn't know when or if Americans will have closure on
John Kennedy's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``People never get their fill of the Kennedys,'' she said.
``They were a family. He was handsome, she was beautiful and they
had adorable children. It was snuffed out pretty quickly, and we
never totally recovered. The act was horrible, as unbelievable
today as it was then, and I think we feel a little cheated. I was
part of it, and I hope it never happens again.''

<P>
   HOUSTON _ She remembers three shots, and then the blood
splattering the passengers in the presidential motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   As the convertible limousine raced to Parkland Hospital that
horrible day in Dallas, Nellie Connally instinctively pulled her
wounded husband, Gov. John Connally, into her lap. She whispered
reassuringly in his ear, not knowing if he was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be still, it's all right, be still, it's all right,'' she told
him, unmindful of her own safety. She was certain that President
Kennedy, who had been sitting in the back seat with Jacqueline
Kennedy, was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Kennedy was saying, `Jack, Jack, they have killed my
husband. I have his brains in my hand,' '' Nellie Connally wrote in
her account of Nov. 22, 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five years later, Connally recalls the ride in the
motorcade as if it happened yesterday. There are no tears or
awkward silences. She has no difficulty finding the words. She
knows the story by heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a strange little person. I've lived an exciting, busy
life, and I never look back,'' she said recently, sitting on a
favorite sofa in her apartment overlooking the Galleria in Houston.
``John Connally would march forward, and there was me right behind.
For months after the assassination it was a constant for us, but
you can't dwell on something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans remain fascinated with the Kennedy assassination and
will commemorate its 35th anniversary tomorrow. Although the
findings of the Warren Commission determined that Lee Harvey Oswald
was the sole gunman, the House Select Committee on Assassinations
said in 1979 that Oswald had an accomplice who fired but missed.
And John Connally, who died June 15, 1993, at age 75, said he
believed that shots came from two directions.
</P>
<P>
   The conspiracy theories continue to burn like the eternal flame
at John Kennedy's grave site.
</P>
<P>
   Nellie Connally, however, dismisses talk of a conspiracy. She
had a front-row seat to history, she said. Who would know better
than she about what happened that day?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe there was a conspiracy,'' she said. ``It was a
terrible, awful, heinous act, but it is what I always thought it
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Connally's recollections of the day are supported by the diary
she kept of the Kennedys' visit to Texas. It was written days after
the assassination, while her husband recuperated at the Governor's
Mansion in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The diary notes were filed and forgotten until 1993, the 30th
anniversary of President Kennedy's death.
</P>
<P>
   Now 79, Idanell ``Nellie'' Brill Connally is a steel magnolia of
Texas, engaging and resilient, a survivor who has not let the
tragic events of November 1993 become a burden. President Kennedy
would probably have said she has vigor, one of his favorite words,
which became part of the everyday American vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   As the nation and much of the world mourned the death of a young
president, keeping vigil in front of their TV sets for three days,
the Connallys endured their own ordeal. It was after John Connally
was released from Parkland and began recuperating at the Governor's
Mansion that Nellie Connally impulsively chronicled the events of
Nov. 21 and 22 on a note pad.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote about the Kennedys' arrival in San Antonio for the
start of a whirlwind, 48-hour Texas trip that took them to Fort
Worth the evening of Nov. 21. The Connallys had lived in Fort Worth
during the 1950s and early '60s, and the president spent his last
night there at the old Hotel Texas, now the Radisson Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   The trip was scheduled to end the evening of Nov. 22 with a
reception given by the governor in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Connally noted that Jacqueline Kennedy was dressed in a white
suit when she arrived. Connally was pleased that she had chosen a
different color. On Nov. 22, however, she and the first lady both
wore pink, a fashion faux pas that became a footnote in history.
</P>
<P>
   Her notes focused on the motorcade and how pleased she was that
the Kennedys were receiving such a warm reception in Dallas. The
Connallys were seated in front of the Kennedys as the motorcade
entered Dealey Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``On that day, Texans were being good and the Kennedys were
being good. I was like a mother with her children behaving,''
Connally said. ``I said, `Mr. President, you can't say that Dallas
doesn't love you.' That was just seconds before there was a loud
noise. I looked back at the president and knew something bad
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   One shot, then a second and a third were fired, shattering the
festive air in Dallas, Connally said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can argue with me as long as they want. The first shot
hit the president. The second hit John. The third shot ... and my
eyes saw bloody matter in bits all over the car,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never occurred to me that anything could happen to me.''
</P>
<P>
   At the hospital, she worried that the governor would be
neglected while surgeons worked feverishly on the president. And
she empathized with Jacqueline Kennedy's loss even before the
official announcement of President Kennedy's death. MORE &QL;

REAR-VIEW MIRROR: LOOKING BACK AT NASCAR SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ During a year when Michael Jordan, Mark
McGwire and the New York Yankees rewrote record books, Jeff Gordon
also has redefined what it takes to become NASCAR Winston Cup
champion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A career-high and record-tying 13 victories accompanied Gordon's
third Cup championship, his second in a row and third in four
years. At 27, Gordon is NASCAR's youngest three-time champion and
the bane//envy of the ego-driven Winston Cup garage area. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since his first championship season of 1995, Gordon has won 40
races. Even if he could continue winning at his current
mind-boggling rate of 10 races a year, it would take Gordon 16
seasons to surpass Richard Petty's career total of 200 victories.
Gordon would be 43 then, four years younger than Petty was when he
won No. 200. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Can the sport withstand 16 more years of Maximum Jeff? Can
Gordon keep pace with his burgeoning obligations without burning
out? How many booed introductions can one man smile through? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These likely are moot points. Because NASCAR's 50-year history
indicates that while runs like Gordon's are frequent, they also are
short-lived. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have years like I had this year, I'll race as long as I
possibly can,'' said Gordon, who counted seven poles, 26 top-five
and 28 top-10 finishes among his accomplishments. ``But the
likelihood of that happening for 20 years, I don't see it. It
really has to do with being competitive, being physically in good
enough shape to go out there and do it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``And I've worked really hard on my schedule away from the
racetrack to make sure I don't get burned out. It's my job to make
sure I don't get burned out and do too much.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As annoying and befuddling as Gordon's domination has become for
his racing peers and NASCAR's loyal fans, is it necessarily hurting
the sport? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Petty, NASCAR's first seven-time champion, said Gordon probably
is turning more fans on to stock-car racing than he is turning
away. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When you open up the paper and see `Michael Jordan, Michael
Jordan' or `Jeff Gordon, Jeff Gordon,' we pay attention,'' said
Petty, a Cup car owner who watched Gordon match his modern era
(since 1972) single-season record of 13 victories. ``It's just like
baseball. Baseball was floating along and nobody was really paying
that much attention to it, and those guys \RMcGwire and Sammy
Sosa\S got to knocking those home runs. All of a sudden, a bunch of
people started keeping up with it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You create new fans that way.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many established NASCAR fans, of course, have spent the better
part of the past two seasons booing Gordon, the No. 24 DuPont
Automotive Finishes Chevrolet Monte Carlo and all things related to
crew chief Ray Evernham and the Rainbow Warriors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line for Gordon, however, is those boos also are a sign
of respect. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you win the championship and you win races, the
people that were booing you still have respect,'' Gordon said. ``I
think that's what we were able to do, especially at the end of the
season.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before this season, Gordon never had won a Winston Cup race in
October or November. But beginning with the rescheduled inaugural
night-time Pepsi 400 at Daytona International Speedway on Oct. 18,
Gordon won three of the season's final four races. Gordon's victory
in the ACDelco 400 at North Carolina Speedway on Nov. 1 added the
11th month to his list of greatest hits, and also clinched his
third championship. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's victory a week later in the rain-delayed NAPA 500 at
Atlanta Motor Speedway allowed him to tie King Richard's 1975 mark
and appropriately ring in his latest title with fireworks and
champagne. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And with all questions answered. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``To run the way we did \Rdown the stretch\S was definitely a
huge step, something that Ray and the guys really went to work on
in the shop,'' Gordon said. ``That was a major goal of ours this
year.'' &QL;

 &QL; 
[cj3][15,11,12.3,12.6,10.6]THE ENVELOPES PLEASE &QL; 
[agatea]A roll call of award-winners from the 1998 NASCAR Winston
Cup season: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {Tim Flock Driver of the Year Award _} Jeff Gordon, for the
13-victory season that tied him with Richard Petty for the most in
NASCAR's modern era (since 1972). Gordon has bagged over $6 million
in 1998, before heading to the season-ending banquet in New York,
where at least another $2 million will be served. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {Leo Durocher//Alice Cooper Mr. Nice Guy Award _} Mark Martin,
for a career-best seven victories and runner-up points finish to
Jeff Gordon. Martin earned a ton of respect for maintaining his
championship focus in the aftermaths of the deaths of his father,
stepmother and stepsister in an airplane crash in early August. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {.MDBO/L'Oreal.MDNM/ Blonds Have More Fun Award _} Jeremy
Mayfield, who bleached his hair after scoring his first Cup victory
at Pocono Raceway in June. But in case Jeremy missed it _ and as
confirmed by former Formula One blondie Jacques Villeneuve _ purple
hair is in now, dude. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {Edsel Ford Engineering Award _} Felix Sabates, whose driving
foursome of Sterling Marlin, Joe Nemechek, Wally Dallenbach Jr. and
Jeff Green combined for zero poles, zero wins and one top-five in
their Chevrolets. Recall that Sabates began the season by jokingly
waving a ``Ford Crying Towel'' during the annual media tour. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {Culligan Man Water Award _} Bruton Smith's Speedway Motorsports
Inc., which was plagued by water, water seemingly everywhere. Rain
delayed both races at Atlanta Motor Speedway; a drop in water
pressure affected the toilets at Bristol Motor Speedway; a drain
backed up at Charlotte Motor Speedway and sent water spewing across
the backstretch; water seeped out of turns 1 and 4 at Texas Motor
Speedway during pole qualifying. Blame it on El Ni$o, Bruton. Or
the /{Star-Telegram./} &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {Dr. Scholl's Foot-in-Mouth Award _} Crew chief Ray Evernham,
for this beauty of a quote after Ford Tauruses dominated the
inaugural Las Vegas 400: ``No Chevy is going to win the
championship this year. That's done. That's over. They've killed
that. No matter what \Rrules\S changes they make, they can't fix
this now.'' Somehow, Jeff Gordon _ Evernham's driver _ won the
championship and single-handedly helped Chevy clinch the
manufacturer's title. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {The X-Files Paranoia Award _} Jack Roush, for the so-called
``Tiregate'' incident. The multiple-Ford car owner accused Ray
Evernham of treating the Goodyear Eagle radial tires on Jeff
Gordon's Chevrolet with an illegal softening compound, which
supposedly enhanced their patented late-race two-tire pit stops.
NASCAR officials impounded tires from the cars driven by both
Gordon and Mark Martin and found no evidence of fudging with the
rules. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {Goody's Headache Powders Award _} Geoff Bodine, who has gone
from NASCAR owner//driver to unemployment line. Bodine, who
purchased the team founded by former Cup champion Alan Kulwicki in
May 1993, has been fired by former partner Jim Mattei. At 49,
Bodine may wind up in the Busch Grand National Series. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {H.A. ``Humpy'' Wheeler Hype Award _} Charlotte-based Cotter
Communications, for its yearlong information blitz that helped
educate a new generation of fans about NASCAR's colorful 50-year
history. The program also gave several of the sport's otherwise
forgotten pioneers and heroes a few minutes of well-deserved
recognition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {Ruben Sierra Village Idiot Award _} To the ``fans'' who
continue to boo Jeff Gordon, a first-class driver and humble
superstar. The guy whipped NASCAR's fiercest competitor _ Mark
Martin _ and everyone else by the rulebook. Deal with it. That
especially goes for the morons who berate Gordon and his wife on
their websites. &QL; 
 &QL; 
[cj3][15,11,12.3,12.6,10.6]What to look for in 1999 &QL; 
[agatea]{1. A glitch-free weekend at Texas Motor Speedway _} Would
be nice. Will the third time be charmed for officials of Speedway
Motorsports Inc., and the renamed Primestar 500? The inaugural Cup
race in Fort Worth in April 1997 was marked by a massive traffic
jam, muddy parking lots and a racetrack that was panned by more
than one prominent driver. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Water seeping out of turns 1 and 4 in April prompted NASCAR to
postpone pole qualifying. A stern warning from NASCAR president
Bill France Jr. to fix the problem areas followed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TMS owner Bruton Smith and Eddie Gossage, the track's executive
vice president and general manager, spent approximately $3 million
to have a new drainage system installed, the tricky turns 1 and 4
reconfigured, the controversial eight-degree ``dual banking''
removed from the turns and the entire 1.5-mile layout repaved. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Gossage eagerly are awaiting what amounts to a papal
blessing from the Cup stars in late March. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {2. Thirty-four races in NASCAR's 51st season _} Up one event
from 1998. After four years of playing host to the NASCAR Busch
Grand National Series, the flat, 1.5-mile Miami-Dade Homestead
Motorsports Complex oval in Homestead, Fla., is scheduled for its
Cup debut Nov. 14. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The schedule now stretches from the nonpoints Bud Shootout at
Daytona International Speedway on Feb. 7 to the traditional
season-ending NAPA 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway on Nov. 21. The
1999 season will end two weeks later than it did this year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {3. The new Chevrolet Monte Carlo _} Hendrick Motorsports is
developing the superspeedway version of Chevrolet's newest Cup car,
and Richard Childress Racing is working on the short-track
iteration. Once NASCAR approves the final specs, General Motors
officials must settle on an introduction date. An August debut is
under consideration, but Hendrick Motorsports is lobbying for the
Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway in May. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {4. Tighter rein on in-season testing _} Sort of. NASCAR again
will allow each team seven tests during 1999, but four will be
controlled by the manufacturers. That leaves three so-called
``open'' two-day tests. And the multicar teams again will be
allowed to pool their sacred information. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {5. Fresh faces changing places _} Busch Grand National regulars
Tony Stewart, Buckshot Jones and Elliott Sadler have secured
full-time Cup rides for 1999. Will any emerge to even remotely
challenge reigning champion Jeff Gordon? Don't bet on it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Definitely worth waiting for will be the five Cup races reigning
BGN Series champion Dale Earnhardt Jr. plans to run in 1999, before
joining his famous daddy and the big boys full-time in 2000. &QL;

LIVES AND LIFESTYLES OF THE WHITETAIL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB HOOD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Mike Biggs of Fort Worth has pursued
whitetail deer with a camera for more than 12 years, becoming one
of the nation's foremost wildlife photographers, but it isn't just
his pictures that might push his new book, The Whitetail
Chronicles, to the top of the all-time list of best-selling
outdoors publications.
</P>
<P>
   Whether behind a camera or behind a rifle sight, Biggs has
become one of the nation's leading authorities on white-tailed
deer. His experiences with photographing and recording deer
attitudes, antler growth and behavioral characteristics separate
his works in The Whitetail Chronicles from many other works. His
experiences have, in his own words, made him more than just an
excellent photographer. He has become an authority in almost every
aspect of a deer's life.
</P>
<P>
   Biggs has had more than 7,500 wildlife photographs published,
including approximately 700 magazine and book covers, but his
specialty has been photographing white-tailed deer. He has had more
than 2,000 photos of different whitetails published in numerous
magazines and books.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real final frontier of whitetail enlightenment lies in the
accurate perception of their lives and times _ the true
understanding of how whitetails live, develop, behave and age under
natural circumstances,'' Biggs said. ``We want the knowledge. We
need the mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   The Whitetail Chronicles is a ``first'' for Biggs in that he
deals more with lives and lifestyles of tremendously large
whitetails rather than in presenting a wide variety of white-tailed
deer photographs as he did in his first two books _ Amazing
Whitetails and Whitetails in Action.
</P>
<P>
   In The Whitetail Chronicles, Biggs presents 500 full-color
whitetail photographs, including numerous aging sequences of bucks
in the wild, giving an unprecedented look at the whitetail aging
process and revealing relationships between aging and antler
development that have never been shown before.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the deer in the book were photographed in the wild,''
Biggs said. ``I believe that there is a big difference in how deer
in the wild and deer in penned situations develop their antlers.
Antler development often is determined by social situations, not
just genetics.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I have done in The Whitetail Chronicles is to present
something I believe has never been done before _ aging sequences of
bucks which I have photographed year after year. Some of them are
bucks that I have re-found six, seven or eight years in a row, and
a few are bucks that I have followed for as many as nine years.''
</P>
<P>
   The aging sequences constitute the heart of the book, but they
by no means are the only important issue that he covers. The book
includes comprehensive information about determining in the field
the age and judging the quality of a live, trophy buck, as well as
a gallery of beautiful and bizarre scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Biggs said that the more man learns about deer, the more
enjoyable it will be to observe and study them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a lot like watching a movie,'' Biggs said. ``We may be
able to enjoy a movie to some extent by its visual effects alone,
but if we understand the characters and the plot, it's always much
more interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Old bucks frequently exhibit limps and scars from battles fought
with other bucks, causing some to become arthritic. But even those
bucks, walking as stiffly as they must, are beautiful animals to
Biggs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost impossible to look at a really old buck without
getting a smile on you face just imagining the times that he has
been through,'' Biggs said.
</P>
<P>
   The bucks featured in The Whitetail Chronicles are among 300,000
color photographs Biggs has taken in six states and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pursuit of mature whitetail bucks is altogether exciting,
challenging, frustrating, humbling and rewarding,'' Biggs said.
``As difficult tasks go, this one is pretty much in a league of its
own.''

GAILEY, REEVES SHARE WINNING ROOTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ When Chan Gailey needed an NFL job, Dan
Reeves came through. When Gailey needed a recommendation, Reeves
came through again.
</P>
<P>
   When Reeves needed a friend in Denver, Gailey was there. But at
the same time, Gailey remained tight with Mike Shanahan and John
Elway, who were not friends of Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   When the NFL kicks off Week 12 today, the combined record of
teams coached by Shanahan, Reeves and Gailey will be 25-5. Which
speaks highly of the Broncos' staff of the late '80s.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Broncos, Shanahan has the defending Super Bowl
champion, so even 10-0 is not a big surprise. At 8-2 in Atlanta,
Reeves is the leading candidate for coach of the year.
``Absolutely,'' agreed Gailey, who might get some votes himself
since the Cowboys are 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, however, the biggest winner in the NFL is the small
Georgia town of Americus.
</P>
<P>
   Need a coach? Go to Americus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chan looked exactly like Opie Taylor,'' Reeves said last week,
recalling his high school days in Americus as a summer-league
baseball coach for grade schoolers. ``But I don't know if Opie
could play. Chan could.''
</P>
<P>
   Americus being the hometown of two current NFL coaches (combined
record, 15-5) is rather unique. ``Must have been something in the
water,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Cowboys approach a critical point in the schedule
(Seattle today and Minnesota on Thursday), Gailey has a quick reply
for his coaching career having reached this stage. ``Dan Reeves
provided the foundation for where I am today,'' he said. ``I will
be forever indebted to Dan.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, eight years younger than Reeves, got his first NFL
coaching chance because of Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only now, being a head coach, do I fully realize how much guts
it took for him to hire me in Denver,'' said Gailey, who joined the
Broncos staff in 1985 as special teams coach. ``I was a wishbone
coach from Troy State, who had nothing but a defensive background
in coaching. But I told Dan I wanted to learn NFL offense. And he
let me.''
</P>
<P>
   Offense was and is the specialty of Reeves, of Shanahan, who was
Reeves' offensive coordinator, and, of course, of Elway. ``I walked
into a pretty good learning opportunity,'' said Gailey, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves admits the Americus connection helped Gailey land that
first NFL job. ``But most hires in this business are because of
people you are familiar with,'' he added. ``I knew Chan. I knew his
father and his family. I knew what I was getting. I didn't have any
doubts about him.''
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, Gailey worked and watched and learned. An on-going
subplot there was the strained relationship Shanahan and Elway had
with Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something I don't talk about,'' Gailey said. ``Things
happen in this business, and then they build over time. But
everyone involved is a fine person, despite the differences that
developed. It wasn't like a bad guy and good guy kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   As the head coach, Reeves was the focal point. With the future
ambition of holding such a job in the NFL, Gailey took mental
notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I came away with was all the things Dan did really,
really well, and then there were things where I said, `OK, I'd have
handled that differently,''' Gailey added. ``Dan is very demanding,
no doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny, that's the way the portfolio on Jerry Jones also reads.
</P>
<P>
   And when Jones developed a sudden interest in January in Gailey
as a head coaching candidate, he obviously wanted a recommendation
from Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in Indianapolis \Rat the scouting combine\S and Jerry
wanted to talk to me,'' Reeves said. ``I had read the names on his
list and heard the rumors, and then suddenly he mentioned Chan. I
was suprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I told him that this was a good person, a solid coach, and
someone who would be perfect for that franchise. The one thing
about Chan is he could work with Jerry. Chan is not an ego guy at
all. I stressed that to Jerry.''
</P>
<P>
   The question about Gailey, since answered, was would he be tough
enough to bring discipline to a team desperately lacking in it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had a doubt,'' Reeves said. ``Chan is from Americus.
Everybody from Americus is tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Going into today's NFL games, head coaches from Americus are
also winning.

 &HT;    How Reeves rebuilt the Falcons
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Falcons are enjoying their best start,
8-2, in the 33-year history of the franchise and wave after wave of
well-deserved national attention.
</P>
<P>
   For all the current acclaim, however, the first stages of
construction of this team were not the least bit glorious.
</P>
<P>
   For about three months after Dan Reeves was hired as coach and
executive vice president in January 1997, it was a zoo at team
headquarters in Suwanee. ``We were going helter-skelter around
here,'' Reeves said. ``If I looked at everything on the whole, it
would just blow you away.''
</P>
<P>
   One night, in the middle of a March '97 storm, Reeves walked out
of his room at the Falcon Inn Hotel, where he was living, and into
his office.
</P>
<P>
   The building was dark. The power was out. There was a commotion
down the hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the phone trying to get the deal done for (fullback
Bob) Christian,'' said general manager Harold Richardson, whose
title at the time was assistant head coach for football operations.
``I was working by candle, and I couldn't see, and Dan didn't know
what all the hollering was.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Richardson nor Reeves had any idea how good Christian
would be. He has proven to be not only an outstanding lead blocker
for Jamal Anderson, who is third in the NFL with 1,066 rushing
yards, but an excellent receiver and a positive influence in the
locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, who had been fired by the New York Giants, inherited a
3-13 team with, among other problems, a lot of players who didn't
like each other and didn't like their coaches. Even so, Ken Herock,
the former vice president for player personnel, left Reeves with a
head start. In less than two seasons, he and his aides have
assembled a team that is suddenly thinking Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   While 38 of the 53 players on the current active roster were
brought on board in the past two seasons, 10 of the 22 current are
pre-Reeves holdovers. Still, there was a lot of work to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``My priorities were defense and a quarterback,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   The next Falcon quarterback was going to be either Elvis Grbac,
a free agent in San Francisco, or Chris Chandler, shoved aside so
Steve McNair could be the Oilers' starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We brought Elvis in,'' Reeves said. ``But Chris is the one
that made the most sense because we could trade for him, we were
willing to give up what they were asking (fourth- and sixth-round
draft choices) and the contract was livable, so that we could still
do some other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler became a Falcon on Feb. 27, 1997. Although he was prone
to injury last year, the Falcons are 15-4 when he starts and
finishes games. Last year, his passer rating of 95.1 was second in
the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't do a lot of what we do offensively if it were not
for Chris,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   On March 3, cornerback Ray Buchanan left the Indianapolis Colts
to become a Falcon. His four-year, $13million contract included a
$4million signing bonus and a first-year salary of $3million.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had to make sure it was (an offer) they wouldn't match,''
Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan wasn't coming to Atlanta until he knew Chandler was the
quarterback. During discussions in the weeks before he signed, he
kept asking about the quarterback situation.
</P>
<P>
   Those two moves were the biggest of the first year, but several
others added up to big gains.
</P>
<P>
   When the Falcons and fullback Craig Heyward couldn't agree,
Atlanta narrowed the fullback search to free agents Lorenzo Neal,
now a backup in Tampa Bay, and Christian, who missed the '96 season
with an injury in Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta planned to draft a cornerback, but the Falcons needed
another one in case the draftee was not ready to play right away.
Richardson, who was in charge of the Broncos' salary cap before
joining the Falcons, knew of Ronnie Bradford, who played in Denver
three years before joining Arizona in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford wound up starting in front of first-round draft choice
Michael Booker. Bradford was better than expected, just as Chandler
and Christian were.
</P>
<P>
   Another player who has worked out better than expected is
defensive tackle Shane Dronett, who was waived in '97 by the Lions
but now starts for the Falcons. He had played half the '96 season
in Atlanta, and defensive line coach Bill Kollar originally voted
against bringing him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize he was here, and Bill had coached him and
didn't like him,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at the film, and I said, `He's better than what we
got.' He played about half the time last year, and that's turned
out to be a good deal. Bill's done a hell of a job coaching him.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves' first draft produced tight end O.J. Santiago, linebacker
Henri Crockett and left guard Calvin Collins, all starters. It also
produced the worst move of the Reeves era: the second-round choice
of defensive tackle Nathan Davis, who was active for just two games
last year. He quit the team on the second day of training camp this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a bust,'' Reeves said. ``He's probably the reason
that we're doing some of the psychological testing we're doing now
(for potential draft choices).''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons had the No. 3 overall pick in that year's draft; if
Tennessee quarterback Peyton Manning had come out early, Atlanta
would have kept the pick.
</P>
<P>
   But Manning stayed, and Atlanta traded that pick and its
third-round choice for Seattle's No. 11 pick in the first round,
plus the Seahawks' second-round pick _ which became running back
Byron Hanspard _ and fourth-round pick _ which became Crockett. The
teams also swapped third-round choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the Manning thing didn't work out, we traded the pick and
picked up some extras that made it easier to live with the picks we
gave up for (Chandler),'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   This year's draft has produced one starter, right tackle Ephraim
Salaam, a seventh-round choice.
</P>
<P>
   After failing to re-sign speedy wide receiver Bert Emanuel, who
signed a big contract with Tampa Bay, Atlanta got a break in May
when San Diego called and offered wide receiver Tony Martin for a
second-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta's had an awful lot of good players,'' Reeves said.
``They've lost them, for whatever reasons. Everybody brings up the
Brett Favre deal or Deion Sanders. The Favre deal _ it wasn't like
they didn't have a quarterback at the time. Chris Miller was a
pretty good quarterback, and Brett was young at the time. Their
track record shows that they brought some good people here through
the draft.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, team president Taylor Smith has given Reeves more freedom
to act, and, with the help of his staff, he has. For example, the
move to bring in free agent free safety Eugene Robinson has
stabilized the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   There are still mistakes, however, such as the free-agent
signing of Corey Louchiey, whom Reeves thought could start at right
tackle. But Louchiey strained a hamstring in training camp, missed
two weeks of camp and two preseason games, and was cut. That cost
Atlanta $500,000 in his signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to throw away money,'' Reeves said, ``but that
enabled Salaam and (Jose) Portilla to get some playing time, and I
think they're both good prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   The team blended faster than Reeves could have hoped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's by far the best chemistry, 10 times better than anywhere
I've been,'' said Chandler, who has played for six NFL teams. ``It
seems like we stick together and do more things together. I just
feel like guys care about one another more.''
</P>
<P>
   The future is not necessarily secure. Fifteen players have
contracts that will expire after this season and 26 after next
season _ although the Falcons will retain ``exclusive rights'' to
many of them. Richardson has started talking to many players _
including Anderson, Dronett, Christian, Crockett and Collins _
about extensions beyond 1999.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Falcons are outpacing expectations and creating new
ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal was to be competitive and try to win, but not do
anything that compromised this team three years down the road,''
Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it and say we've got a long way to go. Our ability
in the long run to be a good football team is going to come down to
our ability to make good decisions.''

 &HT;    Falcons preparing for battle with Bears
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Games like these are the ones that try mens' souls, or
at least test their concentration. When the Atlanta Falcons today
play host to the Chicago Bears, it will on paper beforehand look
like like a blowout.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago is 3-7. The Falcons are 8-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears have scored a total of 15 points the last two weeks _
against the Lions and Rams, no less.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have scored 31 or more points six of their past
seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Several Falcon players and coach Dan Reeves don't want to hear
about that though. ``We can't overlook anybody,'' the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   There's additional cause for concern because running back Jamal
Anderson, the NFL's third-leading rusher with 1,066 yards, is iffy
with a sprained ankle and foot.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the Falcons are familiar with life on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly one year ago, Atlanta was 2-8. The Falcons then won five
of their next six games. Now, almost suddenly, they trail only the
Minnesota Vikings (9-1) in the race for homefield advantage through
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who didn't practice Wednesday or Friday after
suffering his injury in the first quarter of last Sunday's 31-19
win over the 49ers, participated in walk-throughs on Saturday, and
is guardedly optimistic about playing today. If you know Anderson
well, you're betting he plays.
</P>
<P>
   He has never missed a game because of injury, playing in 58
straight.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Anderson plays or not, he knows the perils of this game,
which is expected to draw 58,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk among ourselves, and we look at where the Bears are,
and we know how dangerous the Bears can be,'' he said. ``Anybody
who's been in the league at least two or three years knows that if
you don't prepare, another team will destroy you.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as Anderson's sprained ankle and foot, he said, ``It's
something I'll decide on today, before the game.''
</P>
<P>
   For the third straight game, the Bears will be without starting
quarterback Erik Kramer, who is having shoulder problems. Chicago
has the No. 13-ranked offense in the NFL, but is a much better team
with Kramer.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Steve Stenstrom will start, and the backup will be
rookie Moses Moreno. That's pretty good news for a Falcon pass rush
that has 10 sacks in the past two games.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this game shouldn't be as hard to focus on for the
Falcons as one might think.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has had only two home playoff games in 32 years, and the
last one was Jan. 4, 1981, when the Dallas Cowboys ralled in the
final minutes for a 30-27 win.
</P>
<P>
   Several Falcons would like a chance to do something about that
track record. They've won 14 of their last 18 games, and sit alone
atop the NFC West, but if they don't take teams like the Bears
seriously, the value of what they've accomplished so far will be
minimized.
</P>
<P>
   With the next five games coming against teams with a combined
record of 16-34, the Falcons' focus will remain on focusing for the
next month. This is step one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is setting up real nicely for us,'' said free
safety Eugene Robinson. ``We've got teams to play that don't have
great records, so we've got to take advantage of that.''

 &HT;    QB rises from sub to sublime
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. _ Six months ago and 2,000 miles from here,
in a verdant locale as different from this windswept flatland as
one can imagine, Randall Cunningham leaned over a gimme putt on the
seventh hole at the Sandpiper Country Club in Santa Barbara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Just before he tapped in for bogey, Cunningham paused to catch a
snippet of dialogue between the caddie and playing partner Michael
Jordan. The world's most celebrated athlete had blown a smoke ring
from an expensive cigar, and the bagman was curious about Jordan's
cheroot of choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael said, `Well, this here's a championship cigar,'''
Cunningham recalled last week. ``And then he said, `Cunningham
wouldn't know anything about this brand of cigar,' in a joking way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We laughed about it. But it kind of opened my eyes to what he
was saying. Michael was sending me a message: `Randall, go and get
yourself a championship.' And now that's exactly what I'm trying to
do. I know now that's what brought me back.''
</P>
<P>
   This afternoon, barely two seasons after he had walked away from
the NFL in disgust and disgrace, and less than two weeks after
arthroscopic surgery to flush out a few jagged hunks of loose
cartilage that had nestled under his right kneecap like a burr
under a saddle, Cunningham can take another giant step toward his
Super Bowl goal.
</P>
<P>
   His Minnesota Vikings (9-1) can secure a playoff spot with a
victory over Green Bay (7-3) and a loss by either Arizona or New
Orleans. Perhaps as important, a Minnesota win almost surely would
relegate the two-time defending NFC champion Packers to wild-card
status and give the Vikings a leg up on becoming the first
dome-based team to enjoy home-field advantage throughout the
conference playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   It is a scenario that might have been the same had snake-bitten
starting quarterback Brad Johnson not broken a leg in the second
game of the season and fractured a thumb two weeks ago. But it's
not the situation that would have been predicted for the surprising
Vikings, though, had they been told in training camp that
Cunningham, 35, would be the team's starter for most of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with all of the other offensive weapons they have, you
could have surmised there would be some sort of dropoff going so
many games with a No. 2 quarterback,'' Packers defensive
coordinator Fritz Shurmur said. ``It's the logical assumption.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Cunningham is 7-1 as the starter. It will be difficult for
coach Dennis Green to rationalize returning Johnson to No. 1 status
for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham has thrown 17 touchdown passes with just five
interceptions, and his passer rating of 109.8 leads the league. He
also has controlled his penchant for scrambling and become a
dangerous passer from the pocket. Ambitious game plans designed by
offensive coordinator Brian Billick have made him more adept at
reading defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The metamorphosis has been remarkable. Billick considers
Cunningham's comeback more incredible than that of Doug Flutie.
</P>
<P>
   ``As tremendous as Flutie has been, he only came back from
Canada,'' Billick said. ``Our guy came back from the NFL
graveyard.''
</P>
<P>
   While league MVP honors likely will go to Denver tailback
Terrell Davis, there is support for Cunningham. All 17 Vikings
asked about it Friday cited him as their most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given everything he's accomplished _ and, frankly, everything
that he's been through _ Randall isn't your typical backup
quarterback,'' center Jeff Christy said. ``Still, with some
backups, you don't know if they're going to step in smoothly or
(mess up). But he comes into the huddle and doesn't stutter or
stammer all over himself. Randall is the pro's pro.''
</P>
<P>
   That he is regarded with such esteem represents a dramatic
turnaround for Cunningham, once labeled ``The Pro of Con'' by a
former Philadelphia teammate. During his 11 years with the Eagles,
the only thing as predictable as Cunningham's breathtaking
scrambles were his frequent public outbursts.
</P>
<P>
   Although coddled there by coach Buddy Ryan, Cunningham became
known as a player who typically placed his personal agenda ahead of
the team's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think calling Randall self-centered would be a fair
assessment,'' safety Michael Zordich said. ``He irked a lot of
people with his attitude and some of the things he did.''
</P>
<P>
   The final straw in Philadelphia came during the '95 postseason
when Cunningham left the Eagles during the middle of playoff
preparations to be with his wife in her final week of pregnancy.
His intentions were noble, but the fact he failed to take along a
copy of the game plan didn't go unnoticed by his teammates. When
starter Rodney Peete was injured in the first quarter against
Dallas, Cunningham was forced to play, and he was miserable in a
30-11 defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Despite three Pro Bowl appearances in the late '80s, Cunningham
was widely regarded around the league as an enigma. When he came
out of retirement in 1997 after a year of self-imposed exile spent
installing granite and marble kitchen counter tops in Las Vegas,
some longtime Minnesota veterans doubted the wisdom of Green and
Billick.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the coaches look like geniuses.
</P>
<P>
   If he plays the entire game today, Cunningham probably will log
enough snaps to trigger a clause in his contract that will make him
an unrestricted free agent next spring. He is noncommital about the
future but wouldn't mind staying if the price is right.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Cunningham has to settle for a good five-cent victory
cigar, however, he wants more than anything else to blow smoke at
Jordan the next time they get together.
</P>
<P>
   ``He laid out the challenge for me and, no matter how
good-natured it was, I'm taking it seriously,'' Cunningham said.
``To not get a ring this year would be to fall short of what I've
set out to do.''

REAR-VIEW MIRROR: LOOKING BACK AT NASCAR SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ During a year when Michael Jordan, Mark
McGwire and the New York Yankees rewrote record books, Jeff Gordon
also has redefined what it takes to become NASCAR Winston Cup
champion.
</P>
<P>
   A career-high and record-tying 13 victories accompanied Gordon's
third Cup championship, his second in a row and third in four
years. At 27, Gordon is NASCAR's youngest three-time champion and
the bane/envy of the ego-driven Winston Cup garage area.
</P>
<P>
   Since his first championship season of 1995, Gordon has won 40
races. Even if he could continue winning at his current
mind-boggling rate of 10 races a year, it would take Gordon 16
seasons to surpass Richard Petty's career total of 200 victories.
Gordon would be 43 then, four years younger than Petty was when he
won No. 200.
</P>
<P>
   Can the sport withstand 16 more years of Maximum Jeff? Can
Gordon keep pace with his burgeoning obligations without burning
out? How many booed introductions can one man smile through?
</P>
<P>
   These likely are moot points. Because NASCAR's 50-year history
indicates that while runs like Gordon's are frequent, they also are
short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have years like I had this year, I'll race as long as I
possibly can,'' said Gordon, who counted seven poles, 26 top-five
and 28 top-10 finishes among his accomplishments. ``But the
likelihood of that happening for 20 years, I don't see it. It
really has to do with being competitive, being physically in good
enough shape to go out there and do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I've worked really hard on my schedule away from the
racetrack to make sure I don't get burned out. It's my job to make
sure I don't get burned out and do too much.''
</P>
<P>
   As annoying and befuddling as Gordon's domination has become for
his racing peers and NASCAR's loyal fans, is it necessarily hurting
the sport?
</P>
<P>
   Petty, NASCAR's first seven-time champion, said Gordon probably
is turning more fans on to stock-car racing than he is turning
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you open up the paper and see `Michael Jordan, Michael
Jordan' or `Jeff Gordon, Jeff Gordon,' we pay attention,'' said
Petty, a Cup car owner who watched Gordon match his modern era
(since 1972) single-season record of 13 victories. ``It's just like
baseball. Baseball was floating along and nobody was really paying
that much attention to it, and those guys \RMcGwire and Sammy
Sosa\S got to knocking those home runs. All of a sudden, a bunch of
people started keeping up with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You create new fans that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Many established NASCAR fans, of course, have spent the better
part of the past two seasons booing Gordon, the No. 24 DuPont
Automotive Finishes Chevrolet Monte Carlo and all things related to
crew chief Ray Evernham and the Rainbow Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line for Gordon, however, is those boos also are a sign
of respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you win the championship and you win races, the
people that were booing you still have respect,'' Gordon said. ``I
think that's what we were able to do, especially at the end of the
season.''

<P>
   Before this season, Gordon never had won a Winston Cup race in
October or November. But beginning with the rescheduled inaugural
night-time Pepsi 400 at Daytona International Speedway on Oct. 18,
Gordon won three of the season's final four races. Gordon's victory
in the ACDelco 400 at North Carolina Speedway on Nov. 1 added the
11th month to his list of greatest hits, and also clinched his
third championship.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's victory a week later in the rain-delayed NAPA 500 at
Atlanta Motor Speedway allowed him to tie King Richard's 1975 mark
and appropriately ring in his latest title with fireworks and
champagne.
</P>
<P>
   And with all questions answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``To run the way we did \Rdown the stretch\S was definitely a
huge step, something that Ray and the guys really went to work on
in the shop,'' Gordon said. ``That was a major goal of ours this
year.''  &LR; tagtop:John Sturbin, (817) 390-7760
</P>
<P>
   THE ENVELOPES PLEASE
</P>
<P>
   A roll call of award-winners from the 1998 NASCAR Winston Cup
season:
</P>
<P>
   Tim Flock Driver of the Year Award _ Jeff Gordon, for the
13-victory season that tied him with Richard Petty for the most in
NASCAR's modern era (since 1972). Gordon has bagged over $6 million
in 1998, before heading to the season-ending banquet in New York,
where at least another $2 million will be served.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Durocher/Alice Cooper Mr. Nice Guy Award _ Mark Martin, for
a career-best seven victories and runner-up points finish to Jeff
Gordon. Martin earned a ton of respect for maintaining his
championship focus in the aftermaths of the deaths of his father,
stepmother and stepsister in an airplane crash in early August.
</P>
<P>
   L'Oreal Blonds Have More Fun Award _ Jeremy Mayfield, who
bleached his hair after scoring his first Cup victory at Pocono
Raceway in June. But in case Jeremy missed it _ and as confirmed by
former Formula One blondie Jacques Villeneuve _ purple hair is in
now, dude.
</P>
<P>
   Edsel Ford Engineering Award _ Felix Sabates, whose driving
foursome of Sterling Marlin, Joe Nemechek, Wally Dallenbach Jr. and
Jeff Green combined for zero poles, zero wins and one top-five in
their Chevrolets. Recall that Sabates began the season by jokingly
waving a ``Ford Crying Towel'' during the annual media tour.
</P>
<P>
   Culligan Man Water Award _ Bruton Smith's Speedway Motorsports
Inc., which was plagued by water, water seemingly everywhere. Rain
delayed both races at Atlanta Motor Speedway; a drop in water
pressure affected the toilets at Bristol Motor Speedway; a drain
backed up at Charlotte Motor Speedway and sent water spewing across
the backstretch; water seeped out of turns 1 and 4 at Texas Motor
Speedway during pole qualifying. Blame it on El Ni$o, Bruton. Or
the ``Star-Telegram.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Scholl's Foot-in-Mouth Award _ Crew chief Ray Evernham, for
this beauty of a quote after Ford Tauruses dominated the inaugural
Las Vegas 400: ``No Chevy is going to win the championship this
year. That's done. That's over. They've killed that. No matter what
\Rrules\S changes they make, they can't fix this now.'' Somehow,
Jeff Gordon _ Evernham's driver _ won the championship and
single-handedly helped Chevy clinch the manufacturer's title.
</P>
<P>
   The X-Files Paranoia Award _ Jack Roush, for the so-called
``Tiregate'' incident. The multiple-Ford car owner accused Ray
Evernham of treating the Goodyear Eagle radial tires on Jeff
Gordon's Chevrolet with an illegal softening compound, which
supposedly enhanced their patented late-race two-tire pit stops.
NASCAR officials impounded tires from the cars driven by both
Gordon and Mark Martin and found no evidence of fudging with the
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Goody's Headache Powders Award _ Geoff Bodine, who has gone from
NASCAR owner/driver to unemployment line. Bodine, who purchased the
team founded by former Cup champion Alan Kulwicki in May 1993, has
been fired by former partner Jim Mattei. At 49, Bodine may wind up
in the Busch Grand National Series.
</P>
<P>
   H.A. ``Humpy'' Wheeler Hype Award _ Charlotte-based Cotter
Communications, for its yearlong information blitz that helped
educate a new generation of fans about NASCAR's colorful 50-year
history. The program also gave several of the sport's otherwise
forgotten pioneers and heroes a few minutes of well-deserved
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Sierra Village Idiot Award _ To the ``fans'' who continue
to boo Jeff Gordon, a first-class driver and humble superstar. The
guy whipped NASCAR's fiercest competitor _ Mark Martin _ and
everyone else by the rulebook. Deal with it. That especially goes
for the morons who berate Gordon and his wife on their websites.
What to look for in 1999 1. A glitch-free weekend at Texas Motor
Speedway _ Would be nice. Will the third time be charmed for
officials of Speedway Motorsports Inc., and the renamed Primestar
500? The inaugural Cup race in Fort Worth in April 1997 was marked
by a massive traffic jam, muddy parking lots and a racetrack that
was panned by more than one prominent driver.
</P>
<P>
   Water seeping out of turns 1 and 4 in April prompted NASCAR to
postpone pole qualifying. A stern warning from NASCAR president
Bill France Jr. to fix the problem areas followed.
</P>
<P>
   TMS owner Bruton Smith and Eddie Gossage, the track's executive
vice president and general manager, spent approximately $3 million
to have a new drainage system installed, the tricky turns 1 and 4
reconfigured, the controversial eight-degree ``dual banking''
removed from the turns and the entire 1.5-mile layout repaved.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Gossage eagerly are awaiting what amounts to a papal
blessing from the Cup stars in late March.
</P>
<P>
   2. Thirty-four races in NASCAR's 51st season _ Up one event from
1998. After four years of playing host to the NASCAR Busch Grand
National Series, the flat, 1.5-mile Miami-Dade Homestead
Motorsports Complex oval in Homestead, Fla., is scheduled for its
Cup debut Nov. 14.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule now stretches from the nonpoints Bud Shootout at
Daytona International Speedway on Feb. 7 to the traditional
season-ending NAPA 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway on Nov. 21. The
1999 season will end two weeks later than it did this year.
</P>
<P>
   3. The new Chevrolet Monte Carlo _ Hendrick Motorsports is
developing the superspeedway version of Chevrolet's newest Cup car,
and Richard Childress Racing is working on the short-track
iteration. Once NASCAR approves the final specs, General Motors
officials must settle on an introduction date. An August debut is
under consideration, but Hendrick Motorsports is lobbying for the
Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway in May.
</P>
<P>
   4. Tighter rein on in-season testing _ Sort of. NASCAR again
will allow each team seven tests during 1999, but four will be
controlled by the manufacturers. That leaves three so-called
``open'' two-day tests. And the multicar teams again will be
allowed to pool their sacred information.
</P>
<P>
   5. Fresh faces changing places _ Busch Grand National regulars
Tony Stewart, Buckshot Jones and Elliott Sadler have secured
full-time Cup rides for 1999. Will any emerge to even remotely
challenge reigning champion Jeff Gordon? Don't bet on it.
</P>
<P>
   Definitely worth waiting for will be the five Cup races reigning
BGN Series champion Dale Earnhardt Jr. plans to run in 1999, before
joining his famous daddy and the big boys full-time in 2000.

   Scott in search of a shot
</P>
<P>
   By Curtis Bunn
</P>
<P>
   c. 1998 cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If the NBA ever gets back to the business of
basketball, the Hawks would not have to look far to fill a gaping
hole at small forward. Dennis Scott, a former Georgia Tech star,
has spent much of the offseason and prolonged lockout in Atlanta,
working on his game and reconnecting his ties to the community.
</P>
<P>
   All with hopes of a return. Scott wants to be a Hawk. The way he
sees it, they need each other. Atlanta could use a reliable
perimeter shooter that defenses would have to honor. Scott, who has
made 1,106 of 2,774 three-point shots (40 percent) in his
eight-year career, is considered one of the league's deadliest
long-range bombers. Also, his floor game _ deft passing, quick
hands _ is above average.
</P>
<P>
   The free agent, who split last season between Phoenix and
Dallas, wants a new home to be an old home. Something comfortable,
like a pair of old slippers. Scott, 30, could sign with the Lakers,
as close friend Shaquille O'Neal has been insisting he do. Thing
is, Scott wants Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq keeps telling me to come out there with him, make movies,
win a championship,'' Scott said. ``But I think Atlanta has
championship potential, too. And I love the city. I'm like an
Atlantan. They relate to me because I'm the kind of guy who loves
to go out in the community.''
</P>
<P>
   The professional reason he wants the Hawks is simple, according
to Scott.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know them very well,'' he said. ``I watched against
Charlotte in the playoffs, with Mookie (Blaylock) and Steve (Smith)
needing that third guy on the perimeter with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a guy teams have to guard. You can't leave me. When you
do, everybody knows I can hit the three. And when you don't, it
opens up the inside game for (Dikembe) Mutombo and (Alan)
Henderson. That's something that was lacking for them last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott, an integral part of the Tech '89 Final Four team, has
spent a part of the last year atoning for an incident that
blemished his reputation as one of the league's good guys. As
profanity-laced rap music played in the background, Scott angrily
rambled to kids during a lecture at his basketball camp about
acrimonious dealings with the Orlando Magic. Campers' parents were
outraged.
</P>
<P>
   Scott offered vehement apologies and refunded 100 percent of the
campers' fee. ``It was a mistake that I'll always regret,'' he
said. ``I know I've grown as a person from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reginald Kinchen, Scott's former AAU coach and adviser, said,
``Dennis went right back to that same community this year and did a
free clinic. He confronted his accusers head-on. He followed a bad
situation with something good. What happened that day last year was
totally uncharacteristic. Everyone who knows Dennis knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott does not know when the lockout will end, but he'll
continue to work out and take 500 jump shots a day while hoping for
an Atlanta return. And although he's never made less than $2.5
million in his career, it might not take that much to get him here,
according to Kinchen. ``Dennis is willing to prove himself to be in
Atlanta,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have great respect for Lenny Wilkens,'' Scott said, adding
to his reasons for wanting the Hawks. ``It'd be an honor to play
for him. At the same time, I know I'd add a lot to the Hawks _ on
the court and in the community.

 &HT;    Some are eager to play for Hawks
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Suppose they actually decide to have an NBA season.
Then what?
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks have only four players under contract, plus two
rookies, plus a few likely free agents. At best, that adds up to
eight or nine players, and they still don't have a starting small
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but the answer might be lurking in the wings.
</P>
<P>
   According to his new agent, free agent forward Rick Fox regrets
not taking the Hawks' $1million last season. He opted for the
Lakers instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick is very interested in the Hawks,'' says agent Mark
Portnoy. ``He likes the team, and he thinks he would be a good
fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Smith, one of the Hawks under contract, heard the same
from Fox recently. ``He's really interested in being with us,''
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Fox would not come here for anything less than a good
payday. The Hawks would need several million dollars in salary cap
room to get him.
</P>
<P>
   One ex-Hawk, Grant Long, is living in Atlanta again and also
sending out signals he wants to re-enlist. Long was shipped to the
Pistons with Stacey Augmon to clear cap room for the signing of
Dikembe Mutombo. The deal was a disaster for the Pistons. Augmon
was dealt to Portland, and Long opted out of the final year of his
contract to become a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, Mutombo, Mookie Blaylock and Ed Gray are under contract.
Roshown McLeod and Shammond Williams are the draft picks. Ty Corbin
and Alan Henderson are the free agents likely to be re-signed.
</P>
<P>
   Laettner and the Pistons
</P>
<P>
   Christian Laettner has hired a new agent _ Lon Babby, who has
Grant Hill _ and appears headed for the Pistons. By signing
Laettner while he recovers from an Achilles tear, the Pistons stand
to get him at far less than the Hawks would have paid _ $8.3
million average over six years _ as recently as last February.
Still, Babby says he won't come cheap.
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons see Laettner as the type of player _ a big man with
a Bill Laimbeer perimeter shot _ who can spread the floor for Hill
and Jerry Stackhouse. Babby says Laettner's value as a player has
not been damaged and that medical clauses will be included in a new
deal.
</P>
<P>
   At one point last season, Hill said he would not want to play
with Laettner. The two were not that close at Duke, but Babby said
Hill wants to win and thinks Laettner would be a good fit.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller Tractor
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks might have something in Michigan's Robert ``Tractor''
Traylor, who is down to about 285 pounds after playing at 325 to
340 in college. Traylor starts his daily workouts at 5 a.m. Why?
``Part of it is discipline,'' he said. ``No matter what the
training camp situation will be, I'll be awake and always ready to
work out. I want to be ready when the time comes and make the best
of my opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Tubby's sleeper
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky coach Tubby Smith on Nazr Mohammed, who fell to the
bottom of the first round to Indiana: ``I think he's the biggest
sleeper in the draft. How people could pass on him until the last
pick is beyond my imagination. I think Larry Brown and his staff
got the biggest steal. It's been only two years ago that he was
weighing 300-some pounds. Now he's down to 250, 240. His definition
in his arms and stuff is starting to fill out. He's got a great
attitude, intelligence, good manners, good communication skills and
has a knack for making a big play.''
</P>
<P>
   What's in a name?
</P>
<P>
   Heard about Brian Williams' name change? The free-spirited
Pistons center wants to be called Bison Dele, after apparently
having a spiritual revelation while visiting Bangladesh. Agent
Dwight Manley cannot provide a definition for the new name, but he
says that Bison ``is in amazing condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Flop isn't folding
</P>
<P>
   Ex-North Carolina State center Todd Fuller hired former NBA
All-Stars David Thompson and Bobby Jones to work with him during
the lockout. Four times a week for 90 minutes per session, Fuller,
the Warriors' disappointing first-round draft pick in 1996, works
out with Thompson, one of the game's best-ever offensive players,
and Jones, one of the league's best-ever defenders, at Queens
College in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Discouraging word
</P>
<P>
   Rick Burton, director of the Warsaw Sports Marketing Center with
the University of Oregon's business school, says players better
believe the season is in serious jeopardy. ``Owners have charged
David Stern with gaining economic control, and they cannot continue
under the current model. I believe the league is prepared to shut
itself down for the season. There is no incentive for a number of
owners to agree to terms that do not give them the long-term
financial security they seek.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stern looks at it this way: `I don't have another (Michael)
Jordan ready, don't have any other player who can drive the league.
My ticket prices are too high, and TV ratings are about as high as
they're going to be. I can't afford to go on with this economic
model.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The owner wants ... a more efficient business. The player is
demanding the right to force the owner to run an inefficient
business.

 &HT;    The shrinking NFL
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ New England owner Bob Kraft has the blessing of
commissioner Paul Tagliabue to move the Patriots to Hartford,
Conn., but some league officials are concerned about the ongoing
downsizing of league markets. The previous four franchise
relocations involved going from a bigger area to a smaller one _ Al
Davis taking the Raiders from Los Angeles to Oakland, Georgia
Frontiere moving the Rams from Los Angeles to St. Louis, Art Modell
heading from Cleveland to Baltimore and the Houston Oilers becoming
the future Tennessee Titans. The expansion teams in Carolina and
Jacksonville also are small-market franchises. The Jaguars haven't
been selling out this year, and Panthers owner Jerry Richardson
could find out that Charlotte is a college town if his club doesn't
get things turned around in '99. ``Maybe they're ready to resurrect
the old Decatur Staleys next,'' former Pats guard John Hannah said.
Much to the chagrin of Houston businessman Bob McNair, the league
might try to reverse the trend by awarding its 32nd franchise to
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   A Krafty guy
</P>
<P>
   If Kraft moves his team any farther south, New York will have
three NFL franchises. He apprised Giants owner Wellington Mara and
Jets owner Leon Hess of the possible move while attending a league
committee meeting Wednesday in New York. The move was not easy for
Kraft, a lifetime Bostonian who has wrangled with the Massachusetts
Legislature to try to keep the team there. Kraft pointed out that
40 percent of Patriots fans live outside the state and noted that
people north of Boston do not buy tickets, preferring to watch
games on TV. ``Foxboro had become a studio from where we televised
the games,'' Kraft said. ``So we're just changing the studio.'' It
cost $6 million to build Foxboro Stadium for then-owner Billy
Sullivan. The blueprints for the stadium in Hartford, as Gov. John
Rowland pointed out, will cost more to draw up.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders ailing
</P>
<P>
   Oakland defensive coordinator Willie Shaw has worked wonders
transforming the league's 30th-ranked unit from 1997 into an elite
group. A season-ending knee injury to cornerback Eric Allen,
however, will test the team severely. It will force Shaw to use
nickel cornerback Marquis Walker as the starter opposite Charles
Woodson. Although Walker has played well in situations, he is small
and lacks deep speed. Starting free safety Eric Turner remains
sidelined with a foot injury, and strong safety Anthony Newman is
less than 100 percent. ``We're going to have to get people to step
up now,'' safety Albert Lewis said. ``We've come too far now to see
it slip away.'' With the injuries, coach Jon Gruden has all but
abandoned plans to have Woodson get some snaps at wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe tongue
</P>
<P>
   Denver tight end Shannon Sharpe will appeal the $10,000 fine
levied by the leagueGene Washington for his role in Monday's
embarrassment at Arrowhead Stadium. The appeal hearing figures to
be a short one. Sharpe conceded that he baited Chiefs linebackers
Derrick Thomas and Wayne Simmons for much of the game. ``If I can't
make you upset,'' Sharpe said, ``you're not human. I perfected
this; trust me. I can make anybody upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo general manager John Butler said there was no
disagreement among the staffers on claiming Simmons after his
release by Kansas City. With John Holecek sidelined for a month,
the Bills needed another linebacker for their 3-4 front. Simmons,
whose strength is playing over the tight end, might replace Gabe
Northern in some situations today. ... With tailback Natrone Means
(foot) out of the lineup in San Diego, third-down back Terrell
Fletcher is the starter. Until last week, Fletcher never had more
than 17 carries in a game.

 &HT;    Character flaws Kansas City
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Critics have claimed that the actions of the Kansas
City Chiefs in the closing minutes of Monday night's loss to the
Denver Broncos were the latest signal that the apocalypse is upon
us. To assign such significance to that isolated swatch of football
anarchy is ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   It was the abandonment of gridiron civility, not the end of
civilization, that transpired in the waning moments of another
Chiefs defeat. There was no rioting in the streets of Kansas City
that night, only the embarrassment of the debacle that occurred
between the two sidelines. Middle America hadn't gone over the
edge, just one of its favorite professional football teams.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have contrived to attach big-picture social relevance
to the antics of linebackers Derrick Thomas and Wayne Simmons and
defensive tackle Chester McGlockton will better serve with more
meaningful analyses.
</P>
<P>
   One suggestion: Plumbing the depths of the soul and psyche of
Marty Schottenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   Among the NFL's most respected coaches, Schottenheimer is the
freshest example of someone who sold out in pursuit of a Super Bowl
ring. Despite a brilliant record that includes 11 playoff
appearances and six division crowns in 13 full seasons in Cleveland
and Kansas City, Schottenheimer never has taken a team to the title
game.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, his teams roll through the regular season and fold in
the postseason. Then the emotional Schottenheimer spends a winter
of soul-searching. Eventually, such a gut-wrenching carousel blurs
perspective and generates selective amnesia.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Schottenheimer, it has purged from his memory
banks this important lesson he had stressed most of his career:
Character counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was always a constant with Marty,'' said Oakland Raiders
defensive back Albert Lewis, who spent the first 11 of his 16 NFL
seasons in Kansas City, including five years playing for
Schottenheimer. ``There were a lot of times where he cut the more
talented player because he felt he was a bad seed. I'm not sure
that's the case there lately. That was always a team with dignity.
(But) what happened the other night was an atrocity.''
</P>
<P>
   What occurred in a Denver offensive sequence kept alive by five
personal foul calls against the Chiefs, all of them seemingly
deliberate, was the logical conclusion of several years spent
acquiring veterans of borderline character. The Chiefs' roster is
dotted with players whose rap sheets are longer than their NFL
accomplishments. The retirement of tailback Marcus Allen created a
critical leadership drain.
</P>
<P>
   Before a 1997 game against Denver, a wild-eyed Schottenheimer
all but invited some extracurriculars by telling his player he
would pay any fines incurred in the game. It was a warning sign
that his fine tapestry was beginning to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is meant to savage Schottenheimer, who at one point
in the hours after Monday's game flirted with the idea of
resigning. By definition, NFL coaches are men of great ego, truest
believers in their own ability to turn misfits into snug fits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just Marty,'' former NFL coach Chuck Knox said last
week. ``The pressure of the job has increased so much. Owners want
instant gratification now. It makes you do some crazy things.''

 &HT;    No San Francisco treat
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ San Francisco coach Steve Mariucci is being forced to
deal with a growing concern by some younger players that the team
is catering to Jerry Rice by allowing him to remain in the starting
lineup. Although he leads the league in receptions, Rice at this
point in his career has become more possession receiver than deep
threat. Some of them think the team is appeasing Rice to the
detriment of young wideouts Terrell Owens and J.J. Stokes. Mariucci
and receivers coach Larry Kirksey are adamant that Rice retain a
key role, but look for some changes in the receiver rotation and
possibly even the starting lineup. And with quarterback Steve Young
hurting, look for tailback Garrison Hearst to resurface, especially
against a New Orleans defense that loves to rush the passer.
</P>
<P>
   Giants steps
</P>
<P>
   The decision to start quarterback Kent Graham in place of Danny
Kanell reflects the Giants' feelings on the former Florida State
standout. New York will attempt to get a veteran in the offseason,
and don't discount Kerry Collins; the club thought about claiming
him in October. One vet in whom they have no interest is former
Detroit starter Scott Mitchell. The best bet is that either Kanell
or Graham will be released or traded next spring, and finances
could play a part in the decision. Graham has a '99 base salary of
$1.1 million. Kanell is scheduled to earn a base of $2.25 million
next year and has a $650,000 roster bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Dome, sweet dome
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' Dan Reeves and the Vikings' Dennis Green can be
forgiven if they start doing some scoreboard-watching as the season
chugs toward the home stretch. Both coaches can gain a dome-field
edge in the playoffs, and that has been a rarity through the years.
It is widely known that no dome team has advanced to the Super
Bowl. Also, no dome team has been the No. 1-seeded club in the
playoffs or hosted a conference championship. Six dome teams have
played in the conference title game, all on the road, and all have
lost. ``We feel we can play anywhere, but I don't think many teams
want to come to our place, and that's our psychological
advantage,'' Vikings defensive tackle John Randle said last week.
An Atlanta win today and a Minnesota defeat would give the Falcons
the tiebreaker edge over the Vikings for the top spot in the NFC.
</P>
<P>
   Bear-ly speaking
</P>
<P>
   Although the Chicago Bears recently signed Glyn Milburn to a
three-year extension, discussions have dragged with some other
players they would like to lock up for more years. One obstacle has
been the franchise's continued push for a new stadium. President
Michael McCaskey has negotiator Ted Phillips crunching numbers on
the facility, and players such as wideout Bobby Engram, who is
having a breakout year, might have to wait a while longer before
they get extensions.
</P>
<P>
   Packing it in
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay general manager Ron Wolf concedes that coach Mike
Holmgren figures to depart the Packers at season's end. ``I think
the pressure may be such that he will be forced to explore one of
those other jobs,'' Wolf said. Seattle, San Diego and Washington
are possibilities for Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona coordinator Marc Trestman will allow quarterback Jake
Plummer to work more out of the no-huddle ``Cactus Gun'' offense
today. Of Plummer's 465 yards last Sunday, approximately 340 came
in the no-huddle. ... Detroit wideout Herman Moore, unhappy with
the team's current direction, hopes to discuss his future with
coach Bobby Ross and general manager Chuck Schmidt at season's
endBrad Blank. ... Rookie tailback Skip Hicks

<P>
   Waddell cautions that some sense of normality could return after
each team has played at least 30 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys just typically get off to slow starts, and teams are
relying on rookies and young guys a lot,'' Waddell said. ``The
veteran teams tend to kick it in in the second half of the season.
We still have a long way to go.''

 &HT;    TWO MINUTES WITH: SHELDON KENNEDY
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Team: Manitoba (IHL).
</P>
<P>
   Position: Right wing.
</P>
<P>
   Age: 29.
</P>
<P>
   Hometown: Brandon, Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
   Update: Kennedy played 310 games in eight NHL seasons (1989-97)
with Detroit, Calgary and Boston. Nearly two years ago, he went
public with allegations of being sexually abused by his former
junior coach, Graham Jones, who recently was sentenced to 3 1/2
years. Kennedy recently roller-bladed across Canada to raise $3
million for abused children and plans to build a ranch for abused
children. (Web site: www.anaphe.com). He signed a 25-game contract
with Manitoba of the IHL as he attempts to make a comeback in the
NHL. He missed last season with a broken leg.
</P>
<P>
   On his conditioning: ``I feel like I'm in great shape. You lose
it a lot faster than you gain it. But every day I step out onto the
ice, I feel a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   On his comeback hopes: ``I'm looking at the game like I've never
seen it before. I figure I can't get any worse as a player than I
was before. I mean, I was in the NHL for eight years. I never
lifted a weight or rode a (conditioning) bike. I didn't even enjoy
the game. But it's different now, and I think those things are
going to boost my game. I've never given myself an opportunity
before to play the game the best I can.''
</P>
<P>
   On his psychological healing: ``Just confronting what happened
to me was the biggest key. It's very difficult, if somebody hasn't
been in that situation, to understand the damage that it does to
somebody mentally and the confidence that it drains you of. I've
seen a lot of kids who go from being an A student to not showing up
at class anymore. For me, coming to the rink wasn't fun because it
brought back memories.''
</P>
<P>
   On his roller-blading fund-raiser: ``Once I got out of the fog
of my own ordeal and understood the damage it had done to me, I
guess I understood how much damage (sexual abuse) had done to
people in our society. I looked at the position I was in, and I
thought I could make a huge difference. We didn't have some
scientist in a lab, creating a pill. It's a matter of education.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrashers update
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers, approximately 8,500 tickets into a drive to sell
at least 12,000 by a league-imposed March 15, 1999, deadline, have
come up with a new enticement to lure buyers. All season-ticket
buyers will receive a replica Thrashers jersey _ approximate retail
value of $80-$125 _ for every two tickets purchased. The offer is
retroactive, so more than 4,000 jerseys already have been
committed. Because the team's jerseys will not be unveiled until
early next year, fans who purchase tickets will be given a
redeemable certificate, which club marketing director Derek
Schiller is quick to remind us would make a lovely Christmas or
Hanukkah gift. Schiller allowed that the promotion will be used to
help sell tickets, but he added, ``The major enticement is we want
to be able to go into our home games and have the majority of the
18,500 people there wearing a Thrasher jersey. We're doing it for
team spirit.'' ...General manager Don Waddell returned from a
recent scouting trip to the West Coast. Among the players he
scouted was Czech forward Patrik Stefan, who is playing for Long
Beach in the IHL. European players have the option of playing in
the minor leagues without losing their draft eligibility, while
Canadian juniors do not. ``I've seen him play three times this
year,'' Waddell said. ``He's a special player. He's got soft hands,
he handled the puck well, and he's an 18-year-old playing with men.
As we sit here now, he'll be one of the top five or six players
taken.'' The Thrashers will select no lower than third in the
amateur draft next June.

 &HT;    Trophy deer deserves a hunter's best shot
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATESBORO, Ga. _ When Ken Brown left home in Columbia County to
attend Georgia Southern College in 1971, it was more than a simple
move from one side of I-20 to the other.
</P>
<P>
   To a deer hunter, it was like landing on another planet. He
found things quite different in the Coastal Plain than they were in
the eastern Piedmont.
</P>
<P>
   ``Availability of food is the big difference between Piedmont
and Coastal Plain,'' said Brown, 45, chief of Georgia Southern
campus police for the last 10 years. ``You don't find any 150-acre
peanut fields in the Piedmont.''
</P>
<P>
   The farms of the Coastal Plain are big, rich with soybeans, corn
and cotton, and to the eyes of a visitor from the Piedmont, the
fields seem to go on forever.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Piedmont, where travel areas for deer are fairly
well-defined trails and deer are relatively concentrated, Coastal
Plain deer, with a wealth of food everywhere, are spread out.
</P>
<P>
   Hunting there requires longer shots than the 25- to 100-yard
shots on the Piedmont. One South Carolina gunsmith even developed a
``Lowcountry Bean Field Rifle'' popular in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has hunted the Coastal Plain for about 20 years. Over that
time, he's learned some valuable lessons and developed some strong
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important is matching a good scope with his
hunting rifle.
</P>
<P>
   ``A $100 scope on a $700 rifle is akin to putting a six-cylinder
engine in a Ferrari,'' Brown said. ``I pay as much for my scope as
I did for my rifle, and I don't scrimp on the rings, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown uses a Leupold 3.5 x 210 with his Browning Stainless
Stalker 7 mm magnum bolt action, and it's mounted with heavy,
stainless rings that will keep the scope lined up even after a
couple of accidental drops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good, hard-working scope in my price range. It has good
glapend in the woods, to throw away that gold at the end of the
evening is a waste,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even with the advantage of a good scope and an excellent
rifle, Brown still refuses to shoot at a deer beyond 250 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people can hit a target at 300-400 yards, but there
are not a lot of bullets that will work (on deer at that
distance),'' he said. ``A deer deserves a good killing shot if
you're going to hunt him.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Brown also is picky about his ammunition,
using rather expensive bullets.
</P>
<P>
   For white-tail, he uses a 150-grain Nozzler ballistic round,
which has been good enough to take down a 230-pound-plus,
eight-point buck with a 20-inch inside spread that scored 130 on
the Boone &AMP; Crockett big-game record scale.
</P>
<P>
   For larger game, such as the elk he took recently in New Mexico,
Brown uses a 180-grain Nozzler partitioned round. The elk's antlers
scored 340 on the Boone &AMP; Crockett scale.
</P>
<P>
   Brown advocates practice through the season, not just the
preseason sighting-in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only takes a dollar or two to shoot a couple of practice
rounds every couple of weeks,'' Brown said. ``The deer is a
magnificent animal. You owe it to him to make a good shot.''
</P>
<P>
   KEN BROWN'S HUNTING TIPS
</P>
<P>
   _ The best deer rifle: Religion and politics aside, it's
probably the biggest argument in Georgia. He uses a 7 mm magnum.
</P>
<P>
   _ Covering human scent is important to deer hunters. For hunting
clothing, baking soda is the ultimate coverup. ``I use regular
detergent to wash it but use a lot of baking soda in the final
rinse, and I also throw some in the dryer with my (camouflages).''
How much? He slaps his hand on an arm, and soda dust rises.
</P>
<P>
   _ On commercial scents: ``Pine should be at the top of the list
in Georgia. If you smell like a pine tree, you'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Footwear: He uses rubber boots because they are virtually
scent-free, and only while hunting.
</P>
<P>
   _ On camouflage: ``Buy what's on sale and sit still. Movement
and scent have allowed more bucks to die of old age than anything
the DNR has imposed on hunters with rules and regulations.

 &HT;    Two-minute drill with Oakland's DT Russell
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Subject: Oakland defensive tackle Darrell Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Topic: Improvement in his second NFL season.
</P>
<P>
   Background: After bypassing his senior season at Southern Cal to
enter the 1997 draft, Russell was the third overall selection. In
his rookie season, he started 10 games. But because of veterans
Russell Maryland and Chester McGlockton, he often played out of
position at end and finished with just 44 tackles and 3 1/2 sacks.
The exit of McGlockton in free agency allowed Russell to move to
tackle, and he is dominating opponents. With 49 tackles and nine
sacks, he is suddenly regarded to be among the NFL's top interior
defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Besides playing at your natural position, what's the biggest
difference between last year and this season?
</P>
<P>
   A: Just knowing the ropes, what to expect, makes a difference.
No matter how sure of yourself you are (as a rookie), you're still
like the new kid at school. It's human nature you're more confident
the second time around.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you more comfortable at tackle?
</P>
<P>
   A: In my heart, I will always be an end. My first love is
rushing the quarterback. But the focus of defenses has moved to the
inside, and I don't mind being part of that evolution. You get
better matchups playing tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think opponents view you with more respect now?
</P>
<P>
   A: I hope they respected me last year, but it's also a fact that
you have to pay your dues in this league. I'm a more mature player,
more complete, and I hope that earns respect.

   _ Veteran: The performance of New England quarterback Drew
Bledsoe has suffered with injuries to wideouts Terry Glenn, Vincent
Brisby and Troy Brown. But owner Bob Kraft wants results, not
excuses. If they are to save coach Pete Carroll's job, the Patriots
need a big game Monday night from Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rookie: While everyone is touting Vikings wideout Randy Moss
and Jaguars tailback Fred Taylor for rookie of the year honors,
Colts quarterback Peyton Manning quietly continues to make strides.
The latest came with last Sunday's victory over the New York Jets,
his first fourth-quarter rally.
</P>
<P>
   _ Free agent: To defeat Minnesota today, the Packers will need a
strong performance by nickel cornerback Rod Smith, a journeyman who
began the season in Carolina. At some point, Smith will be in
single coverage against Jake Reed or Randy Moss and that could be a
mismatch for the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Despite last week's loss to Dallas, coach Vince Tobin
has the 5-5 Cardinals in position for their first playoff berth
since 1982. But Tobin must finish strong against a schedule with
six opponents at a combined 20-40 or owner Bill Bidwill could oust
him at year's end.

   San Diego general manager Bobby Beathard would like to keep June
Jones as coach in 1999. In the event he can't, he's already done
some background work on Stanford coach Tyrone Willingham. ... The
deadline for submitting opening bids on the Redskins is Monday.
Team president John Kent Cooke, son of late owner Jack Kent Cooke,
has found an ally in NationsBank chief Hugh McColl and secured
financing. Because this will be a stock sale, the price will be
depressed and that might favor Cooke. ... The singer Seal has
become a big fan of the 49ers and was in the team's locker room at
the Georgia Dome last week. ... Texas' Ricky Williams is still the
top-rated back for most NFL teams, but several scouts claim that
Kevin Faulk of LSU is closing the gap. ... Slow contract
negotiations have been a distraction for 49ers coach Steve
Mariucci, who hopes to gain clout in the team's front-office
shakeup. Vice president Dwight Clark should be freed to join the
Cleveland Browns this week.

 &HT;    Hello, I must be going
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Once a highly touted forward from the former
Czechoslovakia, Roman Vopat now must wonder if he smells bad or
something. Vopat started his career with St. Louis and was dealt to
Los Angeles in 1997 as part of the Wayne Gretzky deal. But that was
just a warm-up. When Vopat landed in Philadelphia on Tuesday, the
Flyers became his fourth employer in a span of 20 days. He played
three games in L.A., then was traded to Colorado Oct. 29 for Eric
Lacroix and a sixth-round pick. But he never dressed for a game
with the Avalanche, which shipped him to Chicago for defenseman Cam
Russell Nov. 10. After three scoreless games, the Blackhawks moved
him to Philadelphia for rookie right winger Mike Maneluk. Vopat,
not exactly an NHL success story, has 17 points and 173 penalty
minutes in 85 NHL games, but at least he's handling his vagabond
lifestyle well. ``I don't know what to say, except I hope this is
the final team for me,'' he said. ``I don't think anyone has been
traded as much as I have in so short a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Habs and Hab nots
</P>
<P>
   This should reaffirm how playing for the Montreal Canadiens _
like the New York Yankees _ is either the best or worst place for a
player, depending on how the team is doing. After being part of a
six-player deal with Chicago, former Habs goalie Jocelyn Thibault
said, ``I've been living through some kind of hell. I feel like a
free man right now.'' Mind you, when Thibault arrived in Chicago,
the Blackhawks had not won in 10 games. Montreal's problems are not
at the same level, but the pressure from fans and media is wearing
on the players and coaching staff. A TV camera last week caught
forward Mark Recchi arguing with coach Alain Vigneault on the bench
while Montreal was in a power play.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   After failing to come back from a hip injury, Cam Neely is
discussing the possibility of a front-office position with the
Boston Bruins. ... Former teammate Ray Bourque on Neely's comeback
try: ``I admire him for giving it a shot. He was sitting at home
wondering if he could play or not, and he had the guts to come out
and find out for himself. If it worked out, it was great for
everybody. If it didn't, it was still great for Cam in some ways.
Nobody loses.'' ... Buffalo free agent Donald Audette is so
disenchanted by contract talks that he and his family have returned
home to Montreal. ``If they were willing to sign me, they could
have done it a long time ago,'' he said. ``I'm losing my time, and
they're losing a player. It's not good for either side.'' The main
sticking point: The Sabres will not guarantee all three years of
their offer. ... Felix PotvinNew Jersey has been mentioned as a
possible landing for Vancouver holdout Pavel BureJohn McMullen

 &HT;    Gretzky star of L.A. story
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In his eight seasons with Los Angeles, Wayne Gretzky
caused two NHL improbabilities: Hockey became cool in the Sun Belt,
leading to expansion in California, Florida, Texas and Arizona, and
the Kings made it to their first Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   But when Gretzky, now a New York Ranger, returned to the Forum
Thursday night , the scene was more reminiscent of Los Angeles life
before he left Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   The game was an announced sellout, but there were several empty
seats at the Forum for Gretzky's final game there. (The Kings are
moving to a new arena next year.) Further, the Kings' 5-1 loss to
the Rangers stretched their losing streak to six games and made
them 1-9-1 since a 4-0 win over New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Wracked by injuries and a schedule that has them playing 21
games in 42 days, more than any other team, the Kings allowed five
goals to a Rangers team that had averaged only 2.3. The Nos. 1 and
2 goalies, Stephane Fiset and Jamie Storr, remain out with injuries
and are joined in sick bay by top defensemen Rob Blake and Doug
Bodger, No. 1 center Jozef Stumpel and winger Russ Courtnall.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were considered a team on the rise coming into the
year, but as coach Larry Robinson said after the Rangers game, ``We
just looked like we were carrying pianos around. They're tired,
dead tired.'' The most fatigued player might be goalie Manny
Legace, who has gone from the IHL to 12 NHL starts but has only a
2-8-2 record to show for a 2.30 goals-against average.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Belt (cont.)
</P>
<P>
   While the Kings have floundered, the often underachieving
Phoenix Coyotes moved seven games over .500 for the first time
since 1991, when they played in Winnipeg. The Coyotes allowed a
league-low 19 goals in their first 13 games. ``We've had a lot of
talent here,'' forward Keith Tkachuk said. ``I think everyone's
just sick of losing. This year, we're ready to play every game.
Guys are getting down, blocking shots.'' Tkachuk, a poster boy for
all that was wrong with the U.S. Olympic team in Nagano, now
claims, ``I'd love to go back.'' Tkachuk had said the trip was a
``waste of time'' after the United States was eliminated from medal
contention. Now he says: ``I said if we didn't win, it was a waste
of time. It wasn't a waste of time being there. It was a great
experience. I want to go back to Salt Lake City, so we can redeem
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Briefly ...
</P>
<P>
   Colorado general manager Pierre Lacroix did not want to be
dragged into a discussion about ex-Avalanche coach Marc Crawford's
candidacy in Atlanta: ``He's a good man and he did a great job for
us. But it's a situation I don't need to comment on. I don't want
to get into a conversation on what might happen with another
organization. We have enough of our own problems here.'' ... Things
are going so well for Phoenix that backup goalie Jimmy Waite went
4-0-1 with a 1.00 goals-against average after starter Nikolai
Khabibulin was injured. ... Colorado is 20-0-7 in the last 27 games
in which Peter Forsberg scored a goal. ... Nashville is
two-for-its-last-33 on the power play. ... During a recent fight
between St. Louis' Tony Twist and Chicago's Dennis Bonvie, the
players told the linesmen not to separate them. ``We weren't done
yet,'' Twist said. ``There were issues to be addressed. I was
looking to knock his head off.''

 &HT;    Writing and quipping about fishing
 &HT;    By Scott Bernarde and Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SHELVES
</P>
<P>
   From Izaak Walton's 17th century poetic perspective, to the dry
wit of a contemporary like Ed Zern, authors have been writing and
quipping about fishing. In the newly released book, ``The Quotable
Fisherman'' ($20, Lyons Press), compiled by Nick Lyons, that
writing is well-represented in the 200 pages which contain 350
memorable and jocular quotes from the world's most interesting
fishing writers. The quotes are as varied at the species of fish
inhabiting the world's streams, lakes and seas. Walton may have
called fishing ``the most honest ingenious, harmless art of
Angling,'' in ``The Compleat Angler'' in 1653, but Zern
wisecracked, ``Fisherman are born honest but they get over it,'' in
``To Hell with Fishing'' in 1945. The rainy-day book catches the
essence of angling, divided into 12 distinct chapters, reflecting
nearly every mood that fishing inspires.

   If there's one thing Sonny Marsh likes better than hunting it's
Tennessee football. He was in Knoxville for last Saturday's game
against Arkansas and heard a great story from another Tennessee fan
before the game. The fan, Robert Phillips, was breakfasting with
his family in a Cracker Barrel restaurant before the Georgia game
when four men wearing orange hats came in and sat at a nearby
table. Assuming they were Vols' maniacs, he told his daughter,
Sabrina, 17, to go tell them, ``Georgia is going to kick butt.'' A
girl without fear, Sabrina, did it. All four raised their hats and
chorused, ``Deer hunter.''

   AUDUBON'S 100TH SPECIAL
</P>
<P>
   Hunters often make the mistake of thinking the Audubon Society
is antihunting. Actually, some members are and some aren't. In its
special 100th anniversary issue, Audubon magazine includes credit
to hunters for the ``spectacular'' restoration of the wild turkey.
It also includes some compelling trivia such as:
</P>
<P>
   _ Elvis Presley was named after Elvis Stahr, former head of the
Audubon Society.
</P>
<P>
   _ The presidents who made Audubon's list of 100 Champions of
Conservation? Richard M. Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Theodore Roosevelt,
Lyndon B. Johnson, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Ted Turner (well, he
says he wants to be president).

   Anybody who has ever had problems rigging a soft-plastic bait _
whether it's remembering the best way to tie three palomar knots on
a Carolina rig (start with tying the leader to the hook, by the
way) or thinking of new way to rig a jerkbait _ the Modern Plastics
Rigging Guide published by TTI Companies ($2.95; 334-567-9788) of
Wetumpka, Ala., can help even on the lake. The guide is a laminated
8x11 sheet of cardboard that outlines 13 different rigs, six of
which are effective on a Southern favorite, the black bass.

   ATLANTA _ Hunters donated 262 deer to the Wildlife Resource
Division's Hunters for the Hungry program during the first
collection weekend, Nov. 8-9.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an all-time high number of deer donated to the Hunters

Director David Waller. ``The number of deer donated to this program
has continued to grow as more and more hunters learn about the
program.''
</P>
<P>
   The first weekend's results totaled more than half WRD's goal of
500 deer donated for the program this year. Hunters have another
opportunity to donate a deer to the program Thanksgiving weekend,
Nov. 28-29.

   Every four or five years, Georgia Power makes it difficult to
launch your boat at Lake Sinclair, but that's not necessarily a bad
thing. By drastically lowering the lake's water level _ it's
currently down about 6 1/2 feet, ``which is a lot for Sinclair,''
according to Comer Gheesling at Little River Park _ the power
company allows home and business owners a chance to fix docks and
seawalls, and complete other structural maintenance. And while
boat-ramp access is limited by the low water (the private ramp at
Sinclair Marina is the only one open that Gheesling knows of), the
fishing success has definitely risen. In a local bass fishing club
tournament last weekend, for example, all 28 boats caught a limit.

<P>
   Turkey Weekend stripers
</P>
<P>
   The North Georgia Striper Club has found an angler's way to work
off some of that Thanksgiving turkey, and it's become one of its
favorite events. Around 30 boats are expected for the fifth annual
Thanksgiving Classic striper tournament Saturday on Lake Lanier.
``Typically, our holiday tournaments (Thanksgiving and Christmas
weekends) are our most popular,'' said tournament organizer Mike
Maddalena. The tournament, which launches and weighs in at
Hammond's Fishing Center in Cumming, runs 5:45 a.m. to 3 p.m. The
entry fee per two-man boat is $50, including $5 for the big fish
award, and there is an 80 percent payback. Registration begins at
5:15 a.m. For information call 770-501-0675 or 770-887-6083.

SPORTS COLUMN: GRAF'S MARKED WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also TEN-CHASE) 
(mk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ About the softened and vulnerable Steffi Graf I have
been hearing so much about; does this evolved persona of the tennis
legend really exist? Lindsay Davenport, wisely suspicious, played
it conservatively deferential, not giving Graf any more incentive
than she already had Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never intimidated when I go out on the court, but it is
very tough to play her indoors,'' said Davenport, merely the
world's No. 1 player, before her Chase Championships semifinal
against Graf at Madison Square Garden. Then, just as Graf was about
to punctuate Davenport's observation with an exclamation point, a
cranky hamstring intervened and Davenport survived, 6-1, 2-6, 6-3,
into Saturday's final against Martina Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it didn't hurt,'' Davenport said of Graf's bad timing.
``I won the last three games.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport didn't sound much like No. 1, before and after, with
her judicious pre- and postmatch strategy against Graf. Already
beaten by Graf in the final of a Philadelphia tournament last
Sunday, Davenport, 22, wasn't about to do the teen-age thing, like
Hingis last summer. Hingis wrote the German off as an expensive
museum piece, claiming Graf ``is old'' and ``her time has passed.''
Graf shrugged off the comments at the time, biding her time, until
last week's Philadelphia quarterfinals, where Graf turned her third
set against Hingis into a 6-0, hit-and-run collision. Hingis and
the other young legends in their own minds will think twice about
dismissing her until Graf decides she is finally done.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Graf struggle back from her numerous injuries these
last three weeks, seeing her eyes narrow in the tense moments at
the Garden, told me she had not battled a body rebelling against
years of overextension just for a farewell tour. Reports of a
mellower, more emotive, soon-to-be 30 Graf notwithstanding, she
seems to be out there with her old blinders on, with the intention
of being the best, not pretty good. No surprise, it's what she
does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I don't have to answer any more questions why am I
doing it, why am I trying,'' she said. ``I think it speaks for
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't recall anyone advising Graf to retire, with the
exception of Hingis, though I suppose Graf might have decided that
Hingis was speaking for the tour, or at least that part of it under
20. Now, unless Graf's tender limbs seriously betray her, they are
all marked women, even Monica Seles, the ultimate victim.
</P>
<P>
   When Graf rallied from being one lopsided set down to catch the
tiring Seles in what even Davenport called ``unbelievable tennis''
Thursday night, there was this great buildup of crowd emotion for
the soap opera's grand dames. From the start of the third set, it
was clearly a matter of time before Graf put Seles away, and you
could sense the anticipation for the moment when the star-crossed
champions approached the net for, as it turned out, nothing.
</P>
<P>
   As the winner, it was the perfect opportunity for a softer
version of Graf to surface, with a warm pat of her opponent's back,
if not an arm around Seles' shoulder. The handshake, instead, was
brief, cool, a turnoff. It left me feeling far less sentiment for
Graf than the enormous respect she deserves.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a clear indication that these two have a ways to go
before they share bagels in the locker room, the higher place
Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert evolved to late in their
rivalry. Of course, they, for the most part, had only each other to
worry about, not the growing number of contenders Graf has returned
to hunt. The top 10 of women's tennis has never had such a colorful
mix of teen-age and young adult contenders. Graf this week had to
defeat the Wimbledon champion (Jana Novotna) and Seles for the
privilege of facing Davenport, winner of the U.S. Open, while
falling short of a showdown with the Australian Open champion,
Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have survived this far, so we will see what comes up next,''
Graf said. ``I do not have any other goals than to play well, no
expectations whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe she talked herself into that, after straining the right
hamstring at 0-30 in the sixth game of the third set, Davenport
seemingly sagging as much from the intensity of Graf's gaze as her
whip forehand and punishing backhand slice. Graf won the next
point, but not many after that. ``How did it look?'' she said, to
the question of diminished mobility.
</P>
<P>
   In such a defiant tone is the message that Graf will fight on
against medical odds because she still believes that there is no
one better. Seles, still struggling with the meaning of it all,
still refusing to get back into pre-stabbing shape, often seems to
be playing just to play. It is difficult to imagine Graf hanging
around very long that way.
</P>
<P>
   She will need those blinders, her iron resolve that doesn't
leave much room for bagels or hugs. This is how Steffi Graf became
great. This is how she held her ground, how she has come back.
There is no such thing as Ms. Nice Graf, and won't be, until she
lays down her racquet for good.

COACHES CAN'T GIVE PLAYERS CREATINE, BUT THEY CAN SELL IT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Coaches cannot give a nutritional supplement
like creatine to their student-athletes, according to University
Interscholastic League rules.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean they can't ``sell'' it.
</P>
<P>
   The league's amateur rule prevents athletes from receiving
everything from T-shirts to free meals, but athletes may
voluntarily purchase those items from boosters or coaches or
whomever is selling.
</P>
<P>
   And coaches can sell those things, including creatine, at a
profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make it available to the kids because we get it at cost and
then the kids can buy it for less than they'd have to pay at a
health food store,'' said Pottsboro head football coach Rick
Cullum, who estimated that 25 percent of the players in his Class
3A program take creatine. ``We don't make a profit off it. In fact,
we probably lose money. I don't think you should make a profit off
the kids, but I know people who do.''
</P>
<P>
   Some representatives at the annual UIL Legislative Council
meeting last month don't think coaches should sell it at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a question of whether creatine is legal or illegal,
but the role of the coach in promoting it,'' UIL associate athletic
director Cynthia Doyle said. ``Our position is that coaches should
not provide anything to students in this manner. If a coach cannot
dispense aspirin to students, why should they be providing these
products?''
</P>
<P>
   The use of creatine and other nutritional supplements, including
the controversial androstenedione, is not prohibited by the
National Federation of State High School Associations.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the federation issued a position statement in August
urging coaches to dispense supplements ``with extreme caution and
in accordance with policies developed in consultation with parents,
health-care professionals and senior administrative personnel of
the school or school district.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing health and safety precautions, liability risks and
ethical concerns, the federation's statement says ``school
personnel and coaches should never supply, recommend or permit the
use of any drug, medication or food supplement solely for
performance-enhancing purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the UIL abides by National Federation rules, the league
began the process of formulating a similar, if not stronger,
position at its annual Legislative Council meeting last month.
</P>
<P>
   The debate that emerged was not about creatine, but about the
fact that coaches can sell it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is the long-term effects of creatine, which hasn't
been out long enough to have concrete, scientific studies on it,''
explained Granbury athletic trainer Mark Gilbert, president of the
Southwest Athletic Trainers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Especially when the products are not regulated by the Food and
Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Supplement supporters contend that, in rural areas, students
wouldn't have access to the products if coaches couldn't distribute
them. Like Pottsboro's Cullum, they say that, without the discounts
coaches receive for resale, the high retail price would put
supplements out of reach for some students.
</P>
<P>
   But if a coach is selling the product ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are not people who have the right to say no to the
commanding adult,'' Don Hendrix, Crosby schools superintendent and
UIL athletic committee member, told ``USA Today''.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, individual school districts decide whether coaches
can sell supplements to their students.
</P>
<P>
   Following the UIL meeting, athletic committee chairwoman Dr.
Jill Shugart, the Garland schools superintendent, returned to her
district and issued a notice prohibiting district coaches and
trainers from selling supplements.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the only action taken by the UIL is asking coaches to
refrain from distributing the substances from an ethical
standpoint, the UIL's Doyle said.
</P>
<P>
   The league isn't asking students to stop taking supplements;
they're merely asking coaches to stop selling them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have we lost perspective when we put so much emphasis on
winning that kids can no longer compete without going above and
beyond a balanced diet?'' Doyle asked. ``Does everything have to be
legislated before coaches see that \Rselling supplements\S is not
the right thing to do?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer should be apparent.

 &HT;    Driesell scores 700th victory
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The exclusive club of NCAA Division I coaches who won
700 or more games Saturday gained its 11th member.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 38 years after he won his first game as a college coach,
Georgia State's Lefty Driesell secured career victory No. 700 at
GSU's Sports Arena as his Panthers defeated North Florida 84-74
with a crowd of 1,108 looking on. It was Driesell's third try at
win No. 700, losing to Florida International in the final game of
last season and Georgetown in the season opener Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just glad to finally get it over,'' said Driesell, in his
second year at the university in downtown Atlanta. ''But as I said
before, I've never made a shot or got a rebound. I've been
fortunate enough to have some good players, good assistant coaches
and some presidents who believed in what we were doing. They
deserve the credit. All I've done was by lead by shouting and
stomping my feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in that debut in November of 1960, when Driesell guided
Davidson to a 65-59 over a Wake Forest team led by basketball
analyst Billy Packer, No. 700 came against a Division II opponent
of the obscure variety.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't come easily. Playing without sophomore point guard
Kevin Morris, who did not find out until Friday that he had
sustained a fractured left foot in the Georgetown loss two days
earlier, Georgia State trailed North Florida 50-38 with 14:02 left
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of Morris, who will be sidelined three to five
weeks, the Panthers had only eight players dressed. Small forward
Chad Searcy was forced to start at the point, where he struggled in
a major way throughout the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kevin is our leader and he runs the offense and plays great
defense,'' said the 66-year-old Driesell, who was out of coaching
two seasons after leaving Maryland. ''With him out, we didn't quite
know what to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior forward Maurice Robertson, after watching his team
flounder about in the first half, was the force that staved off
defeat during the final 20 minutes, when the Tennessee transfer
scored 18 of his 22 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were missing Kevin, but I kept telling the guys that we
were going to win if we kept our composure,'' Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Henry Nieves, a freshman walk-on from Lawrenceville, who
helped hold the Panthers together down the stretch. Nieves scored
only six points, he ran the offense sufficiently enough from the
point and added to his effectiveness with six steals.
</P>
<P>
   ''He doesn't have a scholarship, but after the way he played, I
might have to give him one,'' Driesell said.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers were led in scoring by Anton Reese and center
Torquin Gresham, who scored 25 points each. Their sentiments at the
end were the same as Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just proud to be a part of No. 700,'' Robertson said.
''That's something historic.''

CLINTON URGES NORTH KOREA TO EMBRACE DIPLOMACY, END PROVOCATIONS

<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Embracing South Korea's policy of
diplomatic engagement, President Clinton encouraged North Korea
Saturday to stop its provocative actions and seize the ``historic
opportunity'' offered by Seoul for closer ties.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, emerging from a private session with South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung, reaffirmed the United States' commitment to
South Korea's security and again called on North Korea to allow
inspections at a suspected nuclear-related construction site.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea, run by a secretive, insular regime, recently
refused to allow Americans to inspect a site believed related to
the development of nuclear weapons capacity, one in a series of
provocative actions.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea three months ago launched an unarmed missile over
Japan's territory, and the Washington Post reported last week that
Pyongyang is building two more rocket facilities. It also has sent
a series of spy submarines into South Korean waters, including one
discovered last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``America stands by its unshakable alliance with the Republic of
Korea,'' Clinton said, adding that he and President Kim agreed on
an approach calling for a ``clear-eyed mix'' of diplomacy and
deterrence.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that North Korea's recent actions are ``cause for
concern'' and that Pyongyang ``must satisfy our concerns'' about
the underground site. Clinton has assigned former Defense Secretary
William Perry to review the U.S. policy on North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Kim said he and Clinton ``made it clear that we will not
tolerate any attempt by North Korea to proliferate nuclear weapons,
missiles and other weapons of mass destruction, and decided to
closely coordinate in talking with the North on a wide range of
pending issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton embraced Kim's policy of engagement as South Korean news
reports indicated that Kim's coalition government wanted to avoid
raising tensions with North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Kim recently lifted some restrictions that prevented South
Korean businesses from investing in projects in North Korea. During
the news conference, Clinton spoke about a cruise ship filled with
South Korean tourists who were being allowed into North Korea for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (North Korea) have a great opportunity here, an historic
opportunity with the leadership of President Kim and the position
that he has taken,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the controversial construction site, he added:
``Never, nothing could ever be put into that hole in the ground,
given our defense partnership here, nothing could ever be put into
that hole in the ground that would give the North Koreans as much
advantage, as much power, as much wealth, as much happiness as more
of those ships going up there full of people from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised Kim for his consistent efforts, a first for a
South Korean leader, to reach out to the North. Both Clinton and
Kim noted that the ``sunshine policy'' adopted by Kim has netted
results such as the resumption of four-party talks that would bring
a final settlement to the Korean War. Although fighting stopped in
1953, a peace treaty has never been signed.
</P>
<P>
   The United States maintains 37,000 troops in South Korea where
they stand watch over the border between the north and south.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea, led by Kim Jong-il, has become increasingly
belligerent as its agrarian economy has failed, and millions of
people have suffered famine conditions for several years.
</P>
<P>
   A crisis over the development of nuclear weapons was averted in
1994 when North Korea agreed to stop converting spent nuclear fuel
rods into weapons-grade material. In return, Washington agreed to
provide fuel oil while Japan and South Korea agreed to provide
replacement reactors.
</P>
<P>
   But Pyongyang shocked its Asian neighbors in August when it
fired a missile over Japan. North Korea last week refused to allow
U.S. envoy Charles Kartman to visit the controversial construction
site. North Korea demanded $300 million from the United States if
it wanted to tour the site as payment for the ``insult.''
</P>
<P>
   Kartman said the United States had compelling evidence that the
facility was nuclear-related but later backtracked from that
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the United States has ``strong information that
raises a suspicion, but no one yet knows for sure, at least in our
camp what the facility is and what its intended purpose is. But it
raises a strong suspicion. We need access to it.''
</P>
<P>
   South Korea was Clinton's second stop on his five-day tour of
Asia where the once thriving economies have fallen into deep
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton visited Kim Dae-jung at the Blue House, the South Korean
president's pagoda-style office and residence.
</P>
<P>
   In South Korea, Kim has been praised by many outside the
government for enacting painful but needed reforms that could have
endangered his government. Kim, a former dissident jailed by
previous South Korean regimes, has spent much of his first year in
office trying to rebuild a collapsed economy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will visit U.S. troops today. On Monday, the president
will travel to Guam and then return to Washington.

 &HT;    Direction, degree of NATO activity in Bosnia discussed at forum
 &HT;    By Dale Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ In assessing the current state of the Dayton
Peace Accords, which ended the war in Bosnia three years ago, the
tough word of the agreement turned out to be not ``peace'' but
``accord.''
</P>
<P>
   That was evident Saturday at the University of Dayton, where
more than 30 ambassadors, ministers and experts gathered to debate
what role the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should have in
creating a lasting, multiethnic society in the troubled Balkan
country.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone agreed NATO should do more, but more of what?
The possible answer produced a wide range of divergent views.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now Bosnia is doing more to shape NATO than NATO is in
shaping Bosnia,'' said Susan Woodward of the Brookings Institution
in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The workshop, which concludes today, was sponsored by UD's
Center for International Programs, which received a $50,000 grant
to study how to implement the Dayton Peace Accords. Attending were
representatives from Bosnia, Croatia, Yugoslavia, Slovenia,
Macedonia, Hungary, Albania, Romania, Germany and Bulgaria as well
as U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Balkans are a barometer of the health of Europe,'' said
Mircea Geoana, ambassador to the United States from Romania.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke, the chief designer of the
accord who received an honorary degree from UD on Friday, conceded
in a speech that the accord had flaws.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he accepted the terms, Bosnian President Alija
Izetbegovic said, 'This is not a just peace, but it is peace my
people need,' `` Holbrooke said Friday, recalling the negotiations
at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The peace has held, thanks in part to an international NATO army
that includes U.S. troops. However, several tenets of the Dayton
Accord remain unresolved:
</P>
<P>
   _ The capture of war criminals.
</P>
<P>
   _ The return of some of the more than 2 million refugees
displaced by the war.
</P>
<P>
   _ The final disposition of towns such as Bracko, which connects
the two halves of the Serb section of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   State department official Michael Lekson said Friday that 34 war
criminals were in custody, 29 are at large and 18 have been
acquitted by the international tribunal at The Hague. However,
Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic said the war criminals in
custody were ``small fish,'' compared to suspects like Radovan
Karadzic who are still operating in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO troops have been reluctant to use force to capture war
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Some participants said NATO should be the instrument to
introduce Western values and democracy to the region. As NATO is
looking to expand to include other countries, it is looking more
like a permanent force in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Bennet of the International Crisis Group in Sarajevo
disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The European community has no foreign policy,'' he said. ``It
does have an economic policy, which is paying for what Richard
Holbrooke agrees to. Democracy does not work in a region with three
clear and distinct ethnic groups. If one group gets 50 percent plus
one, it dominates.''

QUESTIONS ABOUT IMPEACHMENT FOLLOW CLINTON TO ASIA

<P>
   SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA _ President Clinton said Saturday he already
has experienced ``a lot of suffering'' because of his relationship
with a White House intern and urged Congress to ``do the right
thing'' as it considers impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, asked if he should face some sort of punishment,
declined to say what Congress should do. The president, here on an
official visit, faced reporters during a news conference with South
Korean President Kim Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, again I say, there has been a lot of suffering _
that is different from punishment, although it's hard to see the
difference sometimes as you're going through it,'' Clinton said,
speaking in quiet measured tones.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, this long ago ceased to be a political issue or a
legal issue and became a personal one. And every day I do my best
to put it right, personally,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee began its impeachment inquiry of
Clinton last week as the president traveled to Asia. Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr, the panel's only witness so far, charged
Clinton had abused the powers of his office in trying to cover up
perjury in a civil deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's 12-hour appearance in the highly partisan forum prompted
his ethics adviser, Sam Dash, to quit in protest because the
independent counsel had adopted an aggressive advocacy for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Also, as the committee voted to expand the impeachment inquiry,
key House Republican moderates, Peter King of New York and John
Porter of Illinois, announced they would vote against articles of
impeachment if brought to the floor by the panel. They estimated 15
to 50 Republicans would join them, assuring defeat for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides appear to be groping for ways out of the political
dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, after initial denials, admitted in August to an
``improper relationship'' with Monica Lewinsky and to trying to
cover up the affair. The president, under fire from members of his
own party, later apologized for the affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is simply not appropriate at this time, in my view, for me
to comment on what the Congress should do,'' Clinton said. ``I
trust the American people and I hope Congress will do the right
thing in a nonpolitical way, if you will, to get beyond the
partisanship and go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls repeatedly show the public opposes
impeachment but supports some punishment such as a censure.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called Starr's ``long-awaited acknowledgment'' that
there was not enough evidence to pursue charges in other issues
under his jurisdiction, such as Whitewater, a ``positive thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr four years ago began investigating whether the president
and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton benefited improperly in their
land development venture in Arkansas. Starr also investigated the
firing of White House travel office employees and the White House's
improper handling of Federal Bureau of Investigation files.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, even half a world away, faced questions about the
Lewinsky scandal. In Japan, where he began his trip on Thursday, an
Osaka housewife asked how Clinton apologized to his wife and
daughter. The woman added that she doubted she could forgive her
husband if he had had an affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I did it in a direct and straightforward manner, and I
believe they did, (forgive him) yes,'' Clinton said the studio
audience at the Tokyo Broadcasting Systems participating in a town
hall meeting.

SOUTHWESTERN BELL PUSHES TO ENTER MISSOURI LONG-DISTANCE MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   _ KANSAS CITY, Mo., _ Southwestern Bell
Telephone Co. on Friday asked the Missouri Public Service
Commission for permission to offer long-distance service to its
local customers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Competitors large and small heckled the application, saying
Southwestern Bell has yet to fully open its local markets to
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Like other regional Bell telephone companies, Southwestern Bell
is prohibited from offering long distance until it proves to
regulators that it has opened its local markets to competition.
</P>
<P>
   For the past year, the company and its competitors have been
waging a public-relations and regulatory battle in five states over
that question.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was no exception. Sprint Corp., AT&AMP;T Corp., MCI WorldCom
Inc. and Birch Telecom lined up in opposition to the application in
Missouri, saying the company had yet to comply with the law.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Bell insisted that its local markets are open, but
that competitors are cherry-picking lucrative business customers
while ignoring the residential market.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri is the last state in its five-state region where
Southwestern Bell has filed a long-distance application.
</P>
<P>
   It has met with little success elsewhere, but company officials
contend that it has a good shot at approval in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very strong application,'' said Priscilla
Hill-Ardoin, the company's president in Missouri. ``We cannot
control our competitors' business decisions, but we have done our
part by fully opening our markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Reactions to similar applications in other states, however,
suggest that Southwestern Bell may be further from approval than it
thinks.
</P>
<P>
   State utility commissions in Kansas, Texas and Arkansas only
recently gave Southwestern Bell's long-distance applications thumbs
down. And an administrative law judge in Oklahoma made an informal
recommendation against approval.
</P>
<P>
   Each state has a slightly different process and made different
recommendations to the company. But the shortcoming most often
cited was the company's failure to provide functional electronic
operations systems, which allow competitors to switch customers
from one company to the next, order installations and repairs and
handle billing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have centralized systems that handle the entire region,''
said Ellen D'Amato, vice president of state external affairs at
Sprint. ``If they were deficient in Kansas two months ago, I can't
believe they've complied in Missouri by now.''
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Bell says it has learned from its experience in
other states. Hill-Ardoin said she has confidence in the Missouri
commission and expected approval within 120 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not interested in a test in Missouri,'' she said. ``We
have spent one ton of money to open our markets, and we invite our
competitors to meet us in the marketplace, now.''

CONDUCT OF CHIEFS COULD COST KC, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   _ KANSAS CITY, Mo., _ If Derrick Thomas
thinks this week's suspension is personally expensive, it may be a
pittance compared to what Monday night's embarrassment at Arrowhead
will cost the area economy and the Chiefs ownership in the years
ahead.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been contended often in this corner of the newsroom that
big-league sports has incalculable economic value because it
showcases the community. There's no way of telling, for instance,
how those television portraits on Monday Night Football in recent
years have helped boost the gross community product.
</P>
<P>
   All that can be said with any certainty is it's the sort of
advertising money can't buy, which has undoubtedly boosted tourism
and enhanced local commercial life. The reason it has had this
effect is because Kansas City always comes off perfectly positive
in every respect, from the team's performance, to the fans'
behavior, to the city's beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Until last Monday night, that is. The reciprocal of good
nationwide PR is that it can turn around and bite you in a painful
place if the images transmute into something ugly. It's difficult
to imagine, say, that the other city by the bay ever reaped any
economic benefit from the thuggish performances of its football
teams over the years. Leastways, nobody ever wrote a song about
leaving their heart in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Within the scope of a few minutes Monday night, a few members of
Kansas City's pro football team undid seven years worth of positive
prime-time image building in a most horrific way. It was as though
the spirit of the old Raiders at their most boorish had taken over
the bodies of those in Chiefs uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Monday Night Football returned to Kansas City in 1991 after the
Chiefs' slide from mediocrity to awful had resulted in prime-time
banishment for most of the 1980s. On that auspicious evening the
Chiefs covered themselves with glory and a young Derrick Thomas had
one of his best games as a pro.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the era of Monday Night Football banishment will begin
anew is an open question at this point, but things certainly don't
look very good.
</P>
<P>
   It must be assumed the National Football League and ABC will be
leery of risking the same sort of prime-time fiasco next season and
will take a cautious wait-and-see approach to the Kansas City
problem. Beyond this consideration, Monday Night Football usually
doesn't feature bad teams, and the Chiefs are very close to
backsliding to their abysmal '80s state.
</P>
<P>
   If worse were to come to worst, Kansas City stands to lose many
more opportunities to put the community's best foot forward for a
national TV audience. The opportunity cost of such a development
can't be precisely known, but we do know this: The 1990s have been
a great decade for the Kansas City area. Part of it has been a good
national economy. But another intangible part of it _ thanks to the
resurgent Chiefs _ also has been the result of lots of national
exposure as a good place to live and do business.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do developments portend an economic hit for the
community, but Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt also will find the
profitability and value of the franchise diminished considerably if
the team reverts to '80s form.
</P>
<P>
   It's only a game, but the stakes go far beyond W's and L's.

VIDEO RECREATES LOVED ONES' LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE POPPER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   OLATHE, Kan., _ Some people seek special
ways to give thanks for a life, even amid the sorrow of death. And
the desire for that kind of thanksgiving was shared by Tom and
Jayne Coones of Olathe, Kan., last October when their 10-year-old
son, Jared, died of leukemia.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``He was the most precious child we could have asked for,'' said
Tom Coones, a manager with Yellow Services. `` We wanted very much
to express our feelings about the wonderful years we had with him.
But we weren't sure how to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day after their son's death they found an answer in a
simple brochure they read at the Memorial Chapel of Olathe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It suggested making a videotape,'' said Jayne Coones. ``And we
both knew immediately that's what we wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The funeral home's manager, Bennie Smith, explained that the
video would be created by a man named Bill DeMay, who, he said, was
particularly good at it. He then advised them to go home and choose
the photographs and music they wanted used in the tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``That turned out to be an emotionally draining task,'' said Tom
Coones. ``We finally chose about 150 photos, but we didn't get it
done until late on the day before the visitation. By then I was in
a panic, not knowing how anybody could pull it all together in just
24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   They delivered their material to the funeral home about 5 p.m.
and were told that DeMay would call them that evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really expected him to say he couldn't guarantee anything,''
said Tom Coones. ``We'd worked with other video makers, doing tapes
for the Leukemia Society, and with them it was always meet the
deadline or forget it. But when Bill called, he wasn't like that at
all. He seemed to understand exactly what I felt. He told me,
`Don't worry. I'll get it done for you. I promise.' ''
</P>
<P>
   DeMay, who is 56 and who works full time as the photography
manager for the local (negin itals here)Auto Trader(end itals),
picked up the Coones' photos at 5:30 that afternoon and raced back
to his Olathe home to start the job.
</P>
<P>
   He does his video work in a cramped, equipment-filled den now
converted to an editing studio.
</P>
<P>
   He began by reviewing the photographs. ``Bennie Smith from the
funeral home told me something of the Coones' story,'' DeMay said
last week. ``So I knew a little about the family. But I never
really know what I'm going to find or how I'll feel when I begin a
project. I only know that making videos like this is always more
than just a job.''
</P>
<P>
   DeMay, a former real-estate salesman, began working with video
production years ago, making tapes for sales meetings and company
Christmas parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the start I loved going into an editing studio and
putting a tape together,'' he said. ``It enriched my life so much
that it became a passion.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, deciding to produce his own work, he invested more than
$7,000 in video cameras, lights and a complex, computerized editing
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me almost a year to master the system,'' he said.
``Many times I was tempted to quit. But I kept at it.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, a year ago, noting the increased use of videotapes in
the funeral business, DeMay approached several funeral homes about
doing their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would just be an interesting technical and
creative exercise,'' he said. ``I found it was much more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The families I work with are hurting terribly, and I know
that. Some people can detach themselves, but I found I can't. And
so I sit alone for hours working with their pictures, seeing their
lives unfold, and it becomes very painful. Sometimes I just sit
there and cry.''

 TAKE-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE POPPER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   OLATHE, Kan., _ sit there and cry.
<TEXT>
<P>
   After reviewing the Coones' photos, DeMay went to work, first
deciding how to shoot each photo on videotape and then using the
images to build an emotional rhythm, an active visual story, by
synchronizing hundreds of precise music and photo transitions.
</P>
<P>
   DeMay's level of craftsmanship has already impressed others in
the photo industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``What most commercial studios produce are really just
videotaped slide shows,'' said Michael Johns, the manager of LeBon
Photo in Overland Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Bill DeMay does much more than that. He employs
documentary techniques, zooming in and out of still photos, panning
across them, using interesting overlaps and dissolves for
transitions. He does real image choreography, and that's very
impressive to me.''
</P>
<P>
   DeMay worked straight through the night on the Coones video. But
at 8 the next morning, just hours before the visitation was
scheduled, the 17-minute tape was not finished to his satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to my job, but I kept thinking about the video,'' he
said. ``Jared Coones was quite a little guy. And seeing all those
family photos showing the great love his parents and his sister,
Meghan, felt for him, I wanted that tape to be perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Unable to focus on anything else, he took time off and went home
to continue polishing the video. In all, he spent more than 20
sleepless hours at his editing console before delivering the tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw it, I was truly surprised at how beautiful it
was,'' said Tom Coones. ``People at the visitation kept commenting
about that, about all the joy and love that were so evident in the
tape. One of my co-workers, who had never even met Jared, told me
later that he thought about the video all night long. He said that
after seeing it he felt like he knew our son.''
</P>
<P>
   That reaction to DeMay's work is not unusual. Last March, for
example, Rick and Linda Kelley, also of Olathe, asked DeMay to make
a memorial tape for the funeral of their daughter, Courtney, who
died of cancer at age 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed at how well it turned out, particularly given the
short time Bill had to work on it.'' said Rick Kelley. ``He
obviously put his heart and soul into it. These days most people
just go after the buck, the almighty dollar, but Bill was truly
concerned with quality. And he reached out to us; he was
emotionally involved.''
</P>
<P>
   More involved, perhaps, than even his clients know.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Bill was making that tape for the Kelleys,'' said
funeral director Bennie Smith, ``he couldn't even describe it to me
without crying.''
</P>
<P>
   DeMay's involvement with his clients is evident in still another
way. He charges between one-quarter and one-half of the industry
average.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's fascinating to me,'' said Bennie Smith. ``Here Bill
is running a business, doing some of the best work around, yet
money doesn't seem to be a major issue for him at all. He's kind of
unique.''
</P>
<P>
   During the six weeks since their son's death, Tom and Jayne
Coones have often sought comfort in the tape Bill DeMay made for
them.
</P>
<P>
   At least once each day, Jayne Coones kneels before the
television set in her living room to watch again as images of her
son appear and fade into others, chronicling his life from the day
he was born.
</P>
<P>
   As she watches, she often cocks her head to the side as though
seeing something beautiful for the first time, and then a rapturous
smile spreads across her face. Only the sorrow in her eyes reveals
the complexity of her emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing the tape helps me get past the memory of the last, hard
months,'' she said. ``It gets me back to remembering happier times.
It's good to do that, I think, to remember the happy times.''
</P>
<P>
   For DeMay, the Coones project is still vivid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making that video broke my heart,'' he said. ``Most people
never know how deeply I feel about the work I do. I'm just the guy
who produces the video. But I know what these tapes mean to
families, and that's the greatest satisfaction of all.''

   WASHINGTON _ After an icy standoff, House members have quietly
begun reaching across party lines in the first tangible sign of a
quest for a bipartisan compromise to the impeachment case against
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   With the House speaker-elect, Bob Livingston, eager to end the
inquiry and the Democratic leader, Richard A. Gephardt, open to
several alternatives, rank-and-file members of both parties
initiated informal conversations last week on a wide range of
possible exit strategies.
</P>
<P>
   The development is significant because until recently, only a
tiny number of House Republicans had been willing even to privately
broach the possibility of short-circuiting the impeachment process.
Every GOP lawmaker in the House and 31 Democrats voted last month
to launch the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers and congressional aides in both parties said
resistance began to fade last week, as Republicans elected a new
leadership team and the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr,
raised no new allegations against Clinton when he testified as the
only major witness in the impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've started talking to moderate Republicans, and most of
them want to resolve this matter and bring it to closure,'' said
Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Lowell Democrat who serves on
the House Judiciary Committee. ``The potential to reach an
agreement is there now.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Livingston and Gephardt each expressed desire in a
meeting last week to resolve the process before the end of the
year, the search for an escape route is complicated by a maze of
political ramifications, procedural possibilities, and
constitutional concerns. The GOP conservatives who control the
Judiciary Committee have given no indication they will cede
jurisdiction of the matter until they vote on articles of
impeachment, as early as Dec. 15. The panel is expected to approve
articles of impeachment for action by the full House.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, White House officials, who routinely participate in
major negotiations on Capitol Hill, generally have sidelined
themselves for fear that if they lobby too vigorously for a
compromise they might be seen as trying to thwart the impeachment
process, and Clinton could suffer a backlash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Congress that is going to have to arrive at a bipartisan
solution,'' said Ann Lewis, White House communications director.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the road to a possible compromise continues to widen as
House Republicans say an increasing number in their ranks either
oppose impeaching Clinton or want to avoid casting a vote on the
issue that could hurt them in the next election.
</P>
<P>
   The estimates of House Republicans who oppose removing Clinton
from office ranged last week from ``more than 20,'' by
Representative Christopher Shays of Connecticut, to ``15 to 40,''
by Representative Peter King of New York, to ``as many as 50,'' by
Representative John Edward Porter of Illinois. All three lawmakers
are Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   With the GOP holding a 228-207 edge in the current House
session, the defection of as few as 20 Republicans would likely be
enough to defeat articles of impeachment in the full House.
Democrats expect all but a handful of Southern conservatives to
vote against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the recent elections were an indication that the
public wants this over with very soon,'' said Representative Jack
Quinn, a New York Republican. ``I believe the interest to impeach
the president is running out of gas.''
</P>
<P>
   If the House fails to resolve the issue in the current session,
the Republican advantage will slip to 223-212 when the next
Congress convenes in January, further reducing the chances for
Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The life of the inquiry is only as long as the life of this
Congress,'' said a senior aide to a Republican lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   The possible outcomes appear to be boundless. ``There are plenty
of ideas,'' said another GOP congressional aide, ``but there is no
magic solution that will have universal appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Barney Frank, a Newton Democrat who serves on the
Judiciary Committee, said Gephardt is willing to join Republican
leaders in ending the process by co-sponsoring a resolution that
criticizes Clinton for misconduct in his sexual affair in the White
House with a former intern, Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   To date, Livingston has not agreed to formal negotiations on a
possible compromise, and he is not expected to do so until the
Judiciary Committee has voted. His staff did not return phone calls
on Friday, but other House Republicans said Livingston is concerned
about being seen as interfering with the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, several conservative Republicans have warned that it
might constitute a conflict of interest if Livingston intervenes
because, as House speaker, he will be third in line to the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gephardt is eager to proceed. ``At some point, the
speaker-elect is going to have to exert some leadership to get this
over with once and for all,'' said Gephardt's spokeswoman, Laura
Nichols. ``It's not clear yet that he has really stepped up to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of both parties balked at one of the most prominent
compromise proposals, to censure and fine Clinton, after numerous
scholars recently told the Judiciary Committee that censuring and
imposing a financial penalty on a single person, even the
president, exceeds the constitutional authority of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, resolutions of censure and reprimand are official
congressional sanctions reserved for members of the House and
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   However, Congress routinely passes resolutions expressing a wide
variety of views about individuals. Just as the House passed a
resolution in the 1970s wishing former President Harry S Truman
happy birthday, Frank said, the House could wish Clinton ``an
unhappy birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank, who is seen among many House members as a master of
legislative compromise despite his partisan public image, said he
favors a resolution that would express disapproval of Clinton's
actions.
</P>
<P>
   But conservatives are likely to react angrily to any proposal
aimed at killing the impeachment process. And many other House
members who are considered open to a compromise believe Clinton
should pay a substantial financial penalty to offset the $4 million
cost of Starr's investigation during the eight months the president
publicly lied about his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Yet without the votes to pass articles of impeachment, any
disciplinary action against Clinton could be killed by a House vote
or a variety of procedural causes. They ranged from a motion to
table the articles to a motion to send them back to the Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unfortunate thing is that many of us think the president
should be admonished,'' Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee are running the
risk of having him get off scot free by pushing for impeachment
when they know they don't have the votes in the House.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders, citing concern that a divisive debate could harm
the national interest, also could decide not to bring the articles
to the floor for a vote, although that scenario is considered
unlikely.

UCLA BEATS USC, 34-17  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif._ It was what a UCLA-Southern California
football game is supposed to be: high stakes, great atmosphere,
standout performances.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in front of 88,080 at the Rose Bowl on a brilliant
Saturday afternoon, the Bruins turned four Trojan fumbles in the
first half into 13 points to race out to a 17- point halftime lead
before cruising to a 34-17 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The victory kept UCLA (10-0, 8-0 Pacific 10) solidly in the
picture for the Fiesta Bowl and a shot at the national
championship. The Bruins came into this game No. 2 in the Bowl
Championship Series standing, which will determine the Fiesta Bowl
matchup.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Bruins' freshman tailback, DeShaun Foster, who stole
the show by rushing for 109 yards and scoring four touchdowns,
including an electrifying 66-yard dash that broke the game open in
the second quarter. After USC (7-4, 5-3) had pulled as close as
27-17 and limited the Bruins to 3 yards on offense in the third
quarter, UCLA turned to Foster. He delivered, scoring on a 1-yard
plunge to put the Bruins back ahead by 17 points with 13 minutes 9
seconds left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The beleaguered UCLA defense, ranked 91st in the nation, came up
with a big performance. Along with forcing six turnovers, the
Bruins sacked the USC freshman quarterback Carson Palmer six times.
Four of those sacks were by the senior outside linebacker Brendon
Ayanbadejo.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA also had local bragging rights on the line in the 68th
meeting of the two schools. The Bruins defeated the Trojans for the
eighth consecutive year as they also looked to get their 20th
consecutive victory over all, dating back to last season. And even
as the largely partisan Bruin crowd began chanting, ``Eight more
years! Eight more years,'' their team had larger aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   It was an entertaining first half despite the numerous
turnovers. The senior Bruin quarterback Cade McNown threw an
interception on his first pass attempt of the game. That eventually
led to a 36-yard field goal by the Trojans' Adam Abrams. But McNown
came out firing on the next offensive series, slinging a 42-yard
pass to Danny Farmer that the senior flanker juggled in the air and
came down with at the USC 20-yard line. The drive was culminated
with Foster's first touchdown, a 4-yard scoring reception with 8:41
left in the opening quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Leading by 14-3 early in the second quarter and driving after
USC's second fumble, a McNown pass intended for Brad Melsby bounced
off the flanker's hands and into the hands of the USC linebacker
Chris Claiborne, who returned the ball 66 yards down to UCLA's
4-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, Palmer lofted a 4-yard pass to the senior wide
receiver Mike Bastianelli to make the score 14-10 with 12:10 left
in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Much like they have all season, the Bruin offense struck
quickly. Less than a minute later, Foster turned a second-down run
off left tackle into a 66-yard scoring dash down the left sideline
that put UCLA up by 21-10. Two more Trojan fumbles led to two UCLA
field goals and a 27-10 Bruin lead at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   With the Trojan defense containing McNown and the offense in the
third quarter, USC put together a 15-play, 62-yard drive that
resulted in a 1-yard scoring run by the junior tailback Petros
Papadakis to pull the Trojans as close as 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   McNown did not have his best performance Saturday afternoon,
completing 12 passes in 20 attempts for 146 yards and two
interceptions.

CLINTON MODERATES TONE IN SPEAKING OF IRAQ, NORTH KOREA
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.  R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL _ Confronted with nuclear and security threats from two
renegade states, President Clinton chose the carrot over the stick
Saturday, urging calm in the face of Iraq's latest moves and
appealing to North Korea to embrace engagement rather than
hostility.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Iraq's refusal Friday to provide documents requested
by UN weapons inspectors, Clinton cautioned, ``I think it's
important that we not overreact here on the first day'' of resumed
inspections. ``I want to make sure we know exactly what the facts
are.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a striking departure from the White House's previous hard
line, just a week after Clinton called off airstrikes against Iraq
when Baghdad agreed to cooperate fully with UN inspectors charged
with finding and destroying suspected chemical, biological and
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the reaction seemed prudent when Iraq did not
object to a surprise search by the UN inspection team.
</P>
<P>
   The president's muted response on Iraq mirrored his enthusiastic
support Saturday for South Korea's policy of trying to engage its
hostile Stalinist neighbor, despite signs that North Korea may be
boosting its ar-sen-al of missiles and planning to resume nuclear
production.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared to be following the message of patience
counseled by his South Korean counterpart, Kim Dae Jung, a longtime
advocate of democracy who, like Nelson Mandela or Vaclav Havel, was
a longtime political prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   Kim spent years in opposition and survived five assassination
attempts, from agents running him over with a dump truck to
scheming to drown him or chop him up.
</P>
<P>
   As president, Kim has chosen to hew a path of engagement rather
than conflict with the North. But recent signs of continued
hostility by North Korea are calling into question the success of
that ``sunshine policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's moderate tone in seeking access to inspect suspicious
sites in Iraq and North Korea follows a softer delivery on the
president's international economic message as well. In Japan and
South Korea in the last three days, Clinton departed from his
administration's pattern of forcefully badgering Asian nations for
economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday Clinton said if Iraq objects to providing certain
documents because they think they have ``nothing to do with matters
covered by the UN resolutions, they ought to say that, and then we
should immediately resolve it.''
</P>
<P>
   National Security Adviser Samuel Berger told reporters that the
UN Security Council is reviewing whether Iraq is meeting its
obligations. If Iraq is defaulting, he said, ``we obviously are
prepared to act.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, concerns have also risen over North Korea's
preparation of an underground facility that could be used for
nuclear production, and its refusal to let inspectors visit the
site. Saturday, Seoul reported that a northern spy vessel attempted
to enter South Korean waters Friday, the latest of several marine
incursions.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from South Korea's presidential palace, just 17 miles
from the most heavily militarized border in the world, Clinton
urged North Korea to keep its promise to halt nuclear weapons
production, warning that ``further provocations will threaten the
progress we have made.''
</P>
<P>
   US special envoy Charles Kartman, who days ago spoke of
``compelling evidence'' that North Korea was preparing a nuclear
facility, Saturday backtracked, saying the United States lacks
``conclusive evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Seoul's foreign minister, Hong Soon Young, cautioned that a
fight over a suspected but unconfirmed nuclear program could easily
anger the mercurial leadership in the North and prompt the North's
leaders to abandon their 1994 agreement to halt plutonium
production.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also made a direct appeal for cooperation to North
Korea's reclusive leader Kim Jong Il during a press conference
carried live on CNN. North Korea's leader is said to watch CNN
religiously.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to a television clip of South Korean tourists
traveling on a cruise ship to North Korea on a landmark visit a few
days ago, Clinton called it a ``beautiful picture.'' He contrasted
that with the grim image of a ``hole in the ground'' that the
United States and South Korea worry is the beginning of a nuclear
installation in the North. Clinton said economic cooperation and
cultural exchange between the Koreas could yield far more than a
military buildup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing could ever be put in that hole in the ground that
would give the North Koreans as much advantage, as much power, as
much wealth, as much happiness, as more of those ships going up
there full of people from here,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But many South Koreans, such as Chang Sung Hee, 33, question the
wisdom of a policy to engage a government so isolated and
unreasonable. ``We're sending tourists to their mountain at the
same time they're sending submarines to us?'' she asked. ``Do we
have any idea what we are doing?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked Saturday why the White House was not threatening swift
military action against North Korea over weapons inspections, as it
has repeatedly done with Iraq, a senior administration official
said the situation in North Korea was not as urgent. Even if the
hole in the ground is intended for a new nuclear facility, the
official said, it would be five to six years from completion.
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore the US commitment to defending the Korean
peninsula, however, the president today will visit US military
training centers near the demilitarized zone. The United States
keeps 37,000 troops stationed in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ended the evening last night by stopping in on a
US-Korean ``friendship concert'' that featured his brother, Roger
Clinton. The younger Clinton sang ``On Shaky Ground,'' an odd
choice given the troubles Clinton is facing in Washington. The
brothers embraced before a standing ovation from the 3,900 guests.

TENNESSEE BEATS KENTUCKY, 59-21  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ The Tennessee Volunteers didn't stop Saturday
at kicking a team that was down. They buried the Kentucky Wildcats,
59-21, and with every touchdown cemented their hold on the title of
the best team in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   They rumbled for 237 rushing yards, exceeding their 217-yard
average, which was already the nation's 14th best, despite losing
perhaps the best running back in the country six games ago. Their
quarterback, Tee Martin, threw for one touchdown and ran for
another and got Tennessee off to its best start (10-0) in 42 years.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a guy who was expected to run from the shadow of his
predecessor, everybody's all-American and the most recent Volunteer
savior, Peyton Manning.
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteer defense, which had given up an average of 12
points a game in its last eight games, defused the Wildcats'
high-powered offense, sacking the Heisman Trophy candidate Tim
Couch six times for 43 yards despite missing its all-America
linebacker Al Wilson, who was nursing a groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   In overcoming one obstacle after another, including having to
come from behind against snake-bitten Arkansas last week, Tennessee
has shown that is the best of the still-unbeaten teams. The voting
polls and the ranking computers are certain to count this
performance the best of the day, and the Volunteers will remain in
the top spot of the new Bowl Championship Series standing. The top
two teams in the standing are supposed to meet in the Fiesta Bowl
in Tempe, Ariz., on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   In 7-4 Kentucky, they beat a high-quality opponent convincingly
_ Martin and most of the Tennessee starters were pulled in the
beginning of the fourth quarter _ while UCLA and Kansas State
needed strong efforts to repel challenges from Southern California
and Missouri, respectively. The Vols have a season-ending game next
week at Vanderbilt and then likely will face either Arkansas or
Mississippi State for the Southeastern Conference championship on
Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky defense, at least, opened the game as if it might
be able to bounce back from a traumatic week of funerals, police
charges and late-night practices. The week began horribly for the
Wildcats last Sunday when their starting center, Jason Watts,
wrecked his pickup truck, killing Couch's best friend, Scott Brock,
a student at Eastern Kentucky, and the Kentucky defensive lineman
Arthur Steinmetz.
</P>
<P>
   Watts was charged with manslaughter and drunken driving when
authorities discovered he had a blood alcohol content of 0.15
percent, which is above Kentucky's legal limit. Couch served as a
pallbearer at Brock's funeral during the week, and the Kentucky
team traveled to the service for Steinmetz.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the game, it looked as if the Wildcats' defense might
provide the emotional lift that Coach Hal Mummme was seeking. The
undersized unit had given up an average of 378.1 yards a game, but
it held the Volunteers to two field goals even though Tennessee
started drives inside the Wildcats' 40-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Couch and his ``Air Raid'' offense, however, showed signs of
mental exhaustion. Couch missed on his first four passes and was
hammered to the ground by blitzes.
</P>
<P>
   He got on track on the Wildcats' third possession. On
third-and-9 at the Kentucky 19, Couch zipped a ball to Kevin
Coleman, who was racing down the right side of the field, for 24
yards. Couch completed five of his next seven passes and put
Kentucky in the end zone on a 3-yard touchdown pass to Lance
Mickelson. Kentucky had the lead, 7-6, for the first and only time
of the day.
</P>
<P>
   From there the game deteriorated into a highlight reel
flickering with images of the orange-clad Volunteers running up and
down the field in perhaps Tennessee's most dominating performance
of the season. Martin went arm to arm with Couch, outthrowing him
by 177 yards to 174 in the first half on 12-of-18 passing. Martin
would finish 13 of 20 for 189 yards and add 54 yards rushing;
Couch, playing from behind, would be 35 of 56 for 337 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Martin took Tennessee 74 yards on perfect 3-of-3 throwing,
including a 41-yard bomb to Peerless Price, who reached over
cornerback Eric Kelly with one hand and gathered the ball in at the
19-yard line. On third-and-goal from the 1, Shawn Bryson rammed it
over left tackle for the touchdown. The fullback, who had 63 yards
and two touchdowns in the first half, then caught a cross-field
pass from Martin for the 2-point conversion.
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers had claimed a 14-7 lead and the momentum to roll
over the exhausted Wildcats. Tennessee did it with explosive yet
surgical strikes. Martin launched a missile that traveled 65 yards
in the air to Cedric Wilson, who was standing all alone in
Tennessee's orange and white checkerboard end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee did it with punishing ground drives, too. Bryson, one
of 24 Tennessee seniors who have compiled a 42-5 record over four
years, chugged between tackles and up the center of the field for a
58-yard touchdown romp.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the first half ended, Tennessee had rolled over
Kentucky for 326 total yards _ on its way to 466 for the game _ and
38 points.

KANSAS BEATS MISSOURI, 31-25  
 (HLW)

<P>
   COLUMBIA, Mo. _ Kansas State can now say it has switched places
with Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation was completed Saturday when the Wildcats
survived the same November scare that the Cornhuskers got from
Missouri last year. No. 2 Kansas State (11-0 over all, 8-0 Big 12
North) held off a Missouri drive in the final minutes to pull off a
31-25 victory at Faurot Field.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri (7-4, 5-3) started its final drive at its own 1-yard
line with 3 minutes 4 seconds to play and marched to the Kansas
State 37 with 1:45 left. But four straight passes by Corby Jones
fell incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   The victory kept alive Kansas State's national championship
hopes. The Wildcats, who are 11-0 for the first time, were ranked
third in the latest Bowl Championship Series poll.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri, which is ranked 19th, suffered its 35th straight loss
to a top-10 team. The Tigers dropped a 45-38 decision to top-ranked
Nebraska last year in overtime, and has four losses this year to
top-10 squads _ Ohio State, Nebraska, Texas A&AMP;M and Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   The battle between Jones and Michael Bishop, two of the best
quarterbacks in the Big 12, played out marvelously. Bishop rushed
23 times for 104 yards and completed 13 of 26 passes for 157 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Jones finished with a season-high 249 yards passing, completing
nine in a row at one point. The senior quarterback's favorite
target was the walk-on John Dausman, who had a career-high 169
yards on 6 catches.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats scored 14 points in the first four minutes of the
second half to erase Missouri's 13-10 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Marlon Charles keyed the first scoring drive,
running 55 yards on the first play of the half. Bishop punched it
in three plays later to give the Wildcats a 17-13 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri had to punt on its next series, and David Allen
returned it to the Missouri 11. Frank Murphy scored from 9 yards
out, and the Wildcats were up, 24-13, before the Tigers knew what
hit them.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy had two touchdowns, rushing for 65 yards on the day.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri took a 13-10 lead at the half in the unlikeliest of
ways _ passing the ball.
</P>
<P>
   A die-hard running team, the Tigers went up on a 20-yard pass
from Jones to Kareem Wise with 1:23 remaining in the second
quarter. It was the 17th straight game in which the Tigers have led
at the half.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State led 7-0 after taking its first drive 62 yards for a
touchdown, scoring on a 10-yard pass from Bishop to Gavin Peries.

   HARTFORD, Conn. _ If Governor John Rowland learned anything when
the National Hockey League Whalers pulled out of Connecticut after
attempts to build a new stadium for the team collapsed in 1997, it
was this: Dealing with owners of pro sports franchises can become
personal.
</P>
<P>
   It was something Massachusetts politicians already knew.
</P>
<P>
   There was no goodwill between Rowland and Whalers owner Peter
Karmanos Jr. They disliked each other. And the governor did not
blink when the team threatened to desert the city and leave a
gaping hole downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karmanos never developed any kind of personal rapport or
relationship with broader Hartford or Connecticut _ political or
otherwise,'' said Democratic Senate Majority Leader George Jespsen.
``He was using the negotiations with Connecticut as leverage for
negotiations with other cities. ... That left a very sour taste.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who owns
Rand-Whitney Containerboard, a southern Connecticut cardboard box
mill, developed a friendship with Rowland as a result of that
business over the last four years. They have had dinners together.
They have chatted at the Capitol. They have jointly attended
charity events and Kraft has frequently had lunch at the governor's
mansion in West Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   It was partly that relationship, built on trust, that allowed
Rowland and Kraft secretly and quickly to develop a plan to move
the football team to Hartford while personality conflicts and
parochialism killed chances of a new stadium in Foxborough, Mass.,
where the Patriots currently play.
</P>
<P>
   They were also desperate. Kraft badly wanted a modern playing
facility for his team and Rowland needed a dramatic development
victory to help Hartford's downtown restoration efforts and improve
poor urban neighborhoods across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Yet how Rowland and Kraft arrived at a successful collaboration
also has much to do with the governor's willingness to share power,
listen, and make others feel important, political talents his
supporters say Rowland has perfected. It just happened that they
were exactly what Kraft was looking for among Boston's political
leaders but never found.
</P>
<P>
   One of Rowland's strengths, his many allies say, is that he is
personable. Stories abound about such things as Rowland walking
into a Putnam antiques shop with his wife, Patricia, striking up a
conversation with a dealer, and later sharing a beer with the man
at a tavern across the way where the UConn Huskies were playing on
TV.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, much of his political process is based on instinct,
loyalty, interpersonal relationships, and never forgetting a favor
_ all of which are important in a small state full of would-be
powerbrokers with long memories. Those who know Rowland best say
trust is the cornerstone of most of his relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Stadium talks between Rowland and Kraft first turned serious on
Nov. 9 during a secret meeting at the low-profile Host Hotel in
Sturbridge _ symbolic for being nearly equidistant between
Foxborough and Hartford. How secret the talks remained became a key
test of the mutual trust the two men had developed.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rowland had casually dropped into conversations with
Kraft the idea of luring the team to Hartford, the team owner never
focused on the overtures until after the Connecticut Legislature
approved funding for a $1 billion downtown redevelopment project
known as Adriaen's Landing along the Connecticut River last May.
Just around the time Massachusetts House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran
was putting the brakes on any hopes of a stadium compromise in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was an article in the New York Times that same month
in which Kevin Sullivan, the Senate president pro tem, was quoted
calling the end of the legsislative session a ``lovefest,''
explaining how the state's politics, with a young Republican
governor at the helm, had moved to a nonpartisan middle ground.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft, who felt acrimony mounting on Beacon Hill over the
stadium, read the story and was intrigued by Connecticut's state of
political cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   There were casual conversations between Kraft and Rowland over
the summer. Conceptual talks. Football was starting. The election
was coming up. But shortly after Rowland won, defeating Democratic
US Representative Barbara Kennelly by the largest plurality in
state history, the phone rang in Jonathan Kraft's office.
</P>
<P>
   It was Brendan Fox, the governor's legal counsel who is the same
age as 34-year-old Jonathan Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said let's get together and start talking,'' Jonathan
recalled. ``It wasn't about public posturing in the media. It was
about trying to focus on getting a business deal done. (Rowland)
got the business side down then switched into political gear.''
</P>
<P>
   So the younger Kraft and Fox had four half-day meetings in the
Brimfield conference room of that Sturbridge hotel, hammering out
details of what would become a $350 million stadium deal. An
agreement was close. But the elder Kraft and Rowland still had not
met face-to-face to discuss it or even had a conversation about the
terms.
</P>
<P>
   So the Krafts drove to a deserted airplane hangar that belongs
to a Rowland supporter in Plainville. For nearly two hours, they
literally stood among antique cars and the second-to-last DC-3 ever
manufactured. The governor and the Krafts ironed out some
differences on improvements around the proposed stadium site, the
number of club seats and luxury boxes in the 68,000-seat facility.
As it turns out, Kraft scored on those points, extracting one of
the most lucrative deals in NFL history. The Connecticut deal not
only provides Kraft with an ultra-modern stadium and free land on
which to build a hotel, but guarantees payments for any premium
seating that goes unsold, a potential $175 million subsidy over 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert wanted to look the governor in the eye and know our
season ticket holders were being taken care of,'' Jonathan Kraft
said. ``And Rowland wanted to look Robert in the eye and know that
if he agreed to the deal they were coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Unbowed to any superstition, the two men shook hands on Friday,
Nov. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Next came the job of selling the proposal to state legislators
and getting Kraft's signature on the tentative agreement before
Massachusetts lawmakers woke up and realized their football team
was in the middle of a quarterback sneak.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday, Rowland had already begun quietly debriefing
lawmakers, but some reporters saw Rowland squiring Kraft around the
Legislative Office Building adjacent to the Capitol and word began
to leak of a possible deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's good,'' Sullivan said of Rowland, ``this is what he
does best and that is to make people feel part of a team. But when
he's bad, it's when he goes into a bunker and draws a line in the
sand. I don't see that happening in this case because everyone has
such an interest in making this work. That in itself should keep
everyone ... on track.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartford Mayor Michael Peters, a Democrat, said Rowland's office
kept him informed that talks were ongoing. But he was only apprised
of the details on Wednesday, 24 hours before the press conference
announcing the deal was finalized.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that was fine with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people say to me, `Mayor how come you weren't
involved as much as you should have been because you're the mayor
of the City of Hartford?' Let me tell you something, if I know
somebody's doing the right job and they're working on behalf of the
city, I wouldn't want too many people in that room either for fear
of screwing up the deal,'' Peters said. ``I think the governor
handled it absolutely perfectly. ... I think he's fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rowland was not so well-liked by the Democrats earlier in
his term, when, sworn in at 37 in 1995, he was the state's youngest
governor ever.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Democrats _ then a minority _ were more
combative and Rowland was more conservative, fighting a
minimum-wage increase and campaigning against abortion.
Connecticut, the richest state in the nation per capita, also has
the most stringent welfare reform law, which Rowland touted in
campaign literature. The governor became embroiled in a few
low-rent ethics investigations _ stemming from the state leasing
his wife a Chevy Suburban and two of his children helping
themselves to state-owned camping equipment. But he came through
unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Rowland supports abortion rights and he recently signed a
new $6.10 per-hour minimum wage law. He has also made improving
Bridgeport, New Haven and Hartford _ three of the country's poorest
cities _ a priority much in the way of an urban Democrat. And he
golfs with he leader of the more liberal House of Representatives,
Democratic Speaker Thomas Ritter.
</P>
<P>
   In Ritter's office on the top floor of Connecticut's tallest
building, sits a rendering of a stadium designed in 1993. Five
years ago the Legislature passed bonding for a new stadium but its
attempt to lure the Patriots to Hartford were foiled when Kraft,
who lives in Chestnut Hill, bought the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a lot of time with Kraft (Thursday) and he was really
blown away with how really well we all work,'' Ritter said. ``We're
all in the office. We're joking. He couldn't believe that all of us
were together. That really struck him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland defeated Kennelly earlier this month by stealing her
party's traditional issues, such as education, property tax relief
and improving working-class cities. Basically, the Democrats agree
with his vision, his plan, and his style. There's nothing much left
to fight about anymore, legislators say.
</P>
<P>
   There are some cynics, though, who contend Rowland changes his
mind to fit public opinion. An editorial cartoonist for the
Hartford Courant frequently draws him with a weather vane on his
head. But Rowland has certainly become more moderate with age,
although at 41, he is still the nation's youngest governor.
</P>
<P>
   His political career began in earnest when he was 23, elected to
the Legislature as a Republican from a Democratic district in
blue-collar Waterbury, where he was a Catholic high school
wrestling star.
</P>
<P>
   The Villanova University graduate held the post for four years
before making the leap to Congress, defeating a three-term
incumbent. In 1990, he ran for governor and lost to Lowell P.
Weicker Jr.
</P>
<P>
   But he found a $400,000 private-sector job as a business
consultant and then ran again in 1994. He won. This time, as a
Northeast Republican with broad-based appeal, much like the
Massachusetts Governor Paul Cellucci and his predecessor William
Weld.
</P>
<P>
   That appeal is evident even on the lonely after-hours streets of
Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Said Patrick Smith, a tour guide-interpreter at the old State
House in Hartford: ``I'm not a big supporter of John Rowland. I
never have been. But I'm impressed with what he's done. He's
impressed me as a good businessman, a good negotiator. I'm
impressed with him swaying people to see what Hartford is really
like.''

SHOULD KENNEDY LIBRARY TAKE A MORE OBJECTIVE APPROACH?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ John F. Kennedy's striking figure and trademark
cadence, echoing through the halls, follow visitors on the
bittersweet trip of nostalgic idealism that is the John F. Kennedy
Library tour.
</P>
<P>
   Here, by Dorchester Bay, Kennedy's legend lives on unsullied. To
this day, the 35th anniversary of his assassination, a steady
stream of admirers comes to the library to recall three dramatic
years. Special exhibits, such as the one last year devoted to
Jackie Kennedy, swell attendance; this year, it has ebbed by 17
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But for some historians, the man honored within these walls
seems more saint than mortal. And for an electorate grown more
accustomed to all-too-human presidents and all-too-human Kennedys,
the library tour can seem a nostalgic trip back in time, to an era
when presidential records were scrubbed clean by the waters of
history.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these scholars, say the nation would be even better
served by broadening the missions of all federally funded
presidential libraries to discuss the mistakes, dilemmas, and
frailties of the chief executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should do more and want to do more,'' said Martin
Sherwin, a history professor at Tufts University. ``I would want
both the museum and the library to provide as sharp a view of the
past, both in the strengths and weaknesses of the Kennedy
administration and of the president himself, as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibits now pay little more than cursory attention to the
failed Bay of Pigs invasion, Kennedy's escalation of US involvement
in Vietnam, the assassination of South Vietnam President Ngo Dinh
Diem, and clandestine efforts to oust Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   On a global map where the flashpoints of the early 1960s are
highlighted, a caption under Cuba states that ``President Kennedy
accepted the CIA plan'' developed under President Dwight D.
Eisenhower for the Bay of Pigs invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Further text, which can be read to reflect nobly on a reluctant
warrior, states that this ``humiliating setback for the new
president'' was one for which ``he quickly accepted full
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby text on Vietnam says that it was Eisenhower who initiated
US military involvement, and that Kennedy dramatically increased
troop strength in response to a deteriorating political situation
there.
</P>
<P>
   The display acknowledges ``tacit'' administration approval of
the coup against the corrupt Diem regime, but states that the South
Vietnamese leader refused a US offer of safety before his
assassination.
</P>
<P>
   These assertions, and all others in the exhibit, pass the muster
of historical accuracy, museum spokesman Thomas McNaught said. But
accuracy without amplification is not as rich, the scholars
contend.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's undisputed victories _ the presidential debates with
Richard Nixon, the Cuban missile crisis, the Peace Corps, and the
pioneering space program _ are noted in much greater detail in a
meandering exhibition, where the president's stirring rhetoric is
never far from earshot.
</P>
<P>
   For many of the library's visitors _ 264,655 came in 1997 _ it
recreates the sense of hope that was Camelot. For others, it plays
like a cast album of ``Camelot,'' a perfectly preserved keepsake
from the early '60s, spinning on through time.
</P>
<P>
   Such a presentation probably should be expected, presidential
scholars say, in a city where Kennedy family influence remains
strong and respected. But President Kennedy, an avid reader of
history, may have welcomed a more candid overview of his
administration, suggests Alvin S. Felzenberg, a Washington-based
lecturer and writer on the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should the (museum's) mission be to glorify its principal, or
to illuminate the period, or to have the public working its way
through public-issue debates?'' Felzenberg asked. ``I'll say it's
all three of them.''
</P>
<P>
   McNaught said the facility makes ``no apologies'' for its
portrait of Kennedy. ``This is a museum and a library devoted to
President John F. Kennedy, and we are going to put the best face
forward without trying to reshape and rewrite history.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding lengthy text panels that probe the wisdom of Kennedy's
moves or delve into complicated issues such as the Cuban revolution
and US sentiment toward communism is an ``unreasonable''
expectation, McNaught said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say to historians'' who critique the display ``that
the museum is not the best place to trigger those kinds of
conversations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other presidential libraries, however, have taken steps in that
direction. The Franklin D. Roosevelt Library in Hyde Park, N.Y.,
examines that president's knowledge of the Holocaust. And in the
Lyndon B. Johnson Library at the University of Texas in Austin,
references to the Vietnam War and domestic protest clearly
demonstrate that Kennedy's successor sparked divisive national
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never a substitute for balanced, honest history,''
said Robert Dallek, a Boston University professor who wrote a
two-volume biography of Johnson and is working on a book about JFK.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Johnson Library,'' Dallek said, ``I found them eager
to put the best possible face on the man, his career and his
presidency. But they didn't neglect the inner-city riots and that
there was dissension over the Vietnam War. It's not a strictly
balanced portrait,'' but the museum does show that ``it wasn't
simply a golden era or a time of universal endorsement of Johnson's
presidency and leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy family has been criticized for the slow release of
White House tapes on the Cuban missile crisis and for severing
cooperation with authors writing unflattering books on the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Historians question whether the family's wishes also account for
maintaining the museum's starry portrait of JFK. McNaught said
decisions can be made independently of the family _ by curator
Frank Rigg, library archivists, and historians _ and that the
exhibit changes constantly. As a result, he said, the picture to
visitors is not unblemished. McNaught cited as examples documents
showing discontent among black leaders about Kennedy's pace on
civil rights, as well as evidence of Nixon's criticisms of Kennedy
during the 1960 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the library sponsors a range of lectures and
seminars on public issues. And its community-education programs may
be the most ambitious of any of the nation's 11 presidential
libraries.
</P>
<P>
   To McNaught, however, the purpose of the museum is more than
storing documents, displaying memorabilia, and sticking to the
historical record. The exhibit is also designed to convey the sense
that Kennedy ignited a spirit of purpose among Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing about John F. Kennedy that the public will always
remember was his idealism, and his ability to give voice to that
idealism and inspire the American people to something that was
greater than themselves,'' McNaught said. ``I do think the museum
accomplishes that well.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Fidler of Chelmsford would agree. Visiting the museum for the
first time last week, Fidler said the exhibition helped him recall
the 1960s, when he was a young man.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the museum should question Kennedy's performance,
or draw attention to personal flaws, Fidler adamantly opposed such
changes. ``I think a presidential library is a repository of
history,'' he said. ``It's a place to reflect, not a place to open
old wounds and further divide the nation.''

OVERSIGHT OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH CALLED FAULTY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saying the existing system for protecting people in research
fails to do the job, a congressional committee and medical
ethicists called last week for an independent national board with
the power to enforce rigorous standards and prevent harm.
</P>
<P>
   Citing psychiatric research abuses detailed in a Globe series
last week as adding impetus to efforts to create such a board,
legislators and ethicists said the move is urgently needed because
of the rapid pace of research and the poorly funded and overworked
state of research review boards.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Christopher Shays, a Republican from Connecticut,
plans to file a bill next year to create such a board, said
Lawrence Halloran, staff director and counsel for the House
Subcommittee on Human Resources, which is chaired by Shays.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is going to be the centerpiece of our legislation,'' said
Halloran, adding that the Globe's findings are helping to propel
the committee's efforts. ``Mr. Shays sees more than ever a need for
a permanent national bioethics panel,'' Halloran said, to set
training and research standards, and to serve as a central registry
of review boards and research.
</P>
<P>
   Some medical ethicists want such a panel to go even further, by
having the authority to sanction researchers deemed to have acted
unethically.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have real live penalties for violating the rights
of subjects _ like fines and jail,'' said George Annas, chairman of
Boston University's health law department, who plans on drafting
legislation to create a board able to impose sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jay Katz, a Yale University professor emeritus of law,
medicine, and psychiatry who was the first to call for such a
national board, agreed: ``If you don't have any teeth in the
regulations, that creates problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The Globe series detailed how psychiatric researchers for the
past 25 years have conducted a series of ``challenge'' and drug
withdrawal studies in order to examine the biology of the disease,
not treat the patients' illness. Mentally ill patients in challenge
studies were given a stimulant such as amphetamine to stir symptoms
of their psychosis; in withdrawal studies, patients were taken off
their medication so they could be observed as their symptoms
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Many past efforts to ensure the ethics of research have been
ineffective, authorities noted.
</P>
<P>
   A policy adopted by the International Committee of Medical
Journal Editors, requiring researchers to indicate whether they
conducted their studies in accordance with ethical standards, has
not prevented the challenge studies from being published.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a very effective mechanism for the
regulation of research,'' said Leonard Glantz, professor of health
law at Boston University School of Public Health. ``Journals are
too distant from events that went on. It's sort of
after-the-fact.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 bill to criminalize unethical research, filed by Senator
John Glenn, the Ohio Democrat who is leaving office next year, has
languished. The Human Research Subject Protections Act he proposed
would have penalized researchers who failed to get proper informed
consent and ethical review in all experiments, whether publicly or
privately funded.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 20 years, federal commissions have repeatedly
called for special research protections for people with mental
illness, without success.
</P>
<P>
   A presidentially appointed National Bioethics Advisory
Commission last week recommended such protections be adopted, but
some legislators, ethicists, and mental health advocates worry that
its proposals either do not go far enough or will be largely
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Halloran, the House committee counsel, said he was particularly
concerned that the advisory commission did not take a strong stance
on research that exacerbates psychotic symptoms, or on safeguarding
the rights of people with mental illness who do not have the
capacity to consent meaningfully to take part in research.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing they couldn't advance the ball on those
subjects,'' Halloran said.
</P>
<P>
   Adil Shamoo, a University of Maryland bioethicist and editor of
the journal Accountability in Research, said he viewed some of the
advisory commission's report as positive, but ``I think
fundamentally it's flawed. They did not prohibit the worst-case
scenarios.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Shapiro, National Bioethics Advisory Commission chairman
and president of Princeton University, said last week that while
the commission only has authority to recommend regulations to the
White House, ``we hope that the report will be convincing to enough
people, that people will be inclined to take these recommendations
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatric researchers, on the other hand, have objected to the
advisory commission's recommendations as going too far and
threatening to paralyze research that could help improve
understanding of and treatments for mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in a letter to the commission, Dr. Robert W.
Buchanan of the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center, which has
conducted some of the challenge studies, said some of the
commission's recommendations ``reinforce concerns'' among
researchers that the commission is ``antipsychiatric research.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Shapiro: ``You never 100 percent satisfy anyone. Either you
ask too much or you ask too little. This is our best judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   But for medical ethicist Annas, who in the 1970s served as a
consultant on the first national commission to call for special
protections for people with mental illness, that is not good
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need an agency to do something, to protect human subjects,
to hold researchers accountable,'' said Annas, adding that the
Globe series is helping to push the calls for a strong national
board. ``It's time.''

mansion in West Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   It was partly that relationship, built on trust, that allowed
Rowland and Kraft secretly and quickly to develop a plan to move
the football team to Hartford while personality conflicts and
parochialism killed chances of a new stadium in Foxborough, Mass.,
where the Patriots currently play.
</P>
<P>
   They were also desperate. Kraft badly wanted a modern playing
facility for his team and Rowland needed a dramatic development
victory to help Hartford's downtown restoration efforts and improve
poor urban neighborhoods across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Yet how Rowland and Kraft arrived at a successful collaboration
also has much to do with the governor's willingness to share power,
listen, and make others feel important, political talents his
supporters say Rowland has perfected. It just happened that they
were exactly what Kraft was looking for among Boston's political
leaders but never found.
</P>
<P>
   One of Rowland's strengths, his many allies say, is that he is
personable. Stories abound about such things as Rowland walking
into a Putnam antiques shop with his wife, Patricia, striking up a
conversation with a dealer, and later sharing a beer with the man
at a tavern across the way where the UConn Huskies were playing on
TV.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, much of his political process is based on instinct,
loyalty, interpersonal relationships, and never forgetting a favor
_ all of which are important in a small state full of would-be
powerbrokers with long memories. Those who know Rowland best say
trust is the cornerstone of most of his relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Stadium talks between Rowland and Kraft first turned serious on
Nov. 9 during a secret meeting at the low-profile Host Hotel in
Sturbridge _ symbolic for being nearly equidistant between
Foxborough and Hartford. How secret the talks remained became a key
test of the mutual trust the two men had developed.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rowland had casually dropped into conversations with
Kraft the idea of luring the team to Hartford, the team owner never
focused on the overtures until after the Connecticut Legislature
approved funding for a $1 billion downtown redevelopment project
known as Adriaen's Landing along the Connecticut River last May.
Just around the time Massachusetts House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran
was putting the brakes on any hopes of a stadium compromise in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was an article in the New York Times that same month
in which Kevin Sullivan, the Senate president pro tem, was quoted
calling the end of the legsislative session a ``lovefest,''
explaining how the state's politics, with a young Republican
governor at the helm, had moved to a nonpartisan middle ground.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft, who felt acrimony mounting on Beacon Hill over the
stadium, read the story and was intrigued by Connecticut's state of
political cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   There were casual conversations between Kraft and Rowland over
the summer. Conceptual talks. Football was starting. The election
was coming up. But shortly after Rowland won, defeating Democratic
US Representative Barbara Kennelly by the largest plurality in
state history, the phone rang in Jonathan Kraft's office.
</P>
<P>
   It was Brendan Fox, the governor's legal counsel who is the same
age as 34-year-old Jonathan Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said let's get together and start talking,'' Jonathan
recalled. ``It wasn't about public posturing in the media. It was
about trying to focus on getting a business deal done. (Rowland)
got the business side down then switched into political gear.''
</P>
<P>
   So the younger Kraft and Fox had four half-day meetings in the
Brimfield conference room of that Sturbridge hotel, hammering out
details of what would become a $350 million stadium deal. An
agreement was close. But the elder Kraft and Rowland still had not
met face-to-face to discuss it or even had a conversation about the
terms.
</P>
<P>
   So the Krafts drove to a deserted airplane hangar that belongs
to a Rowland supporter in Plainville. For nearly two hours, they
literally stood among antique cars and the second-to-last DC-3 ever
manufactured. The governor and the Krafts ironed out some
differences on improvements around the proposed stadium site, the
number of club seats and luxury boxes in the 68,000-seat facility.
As it turns out, Kraft scored on those points, extracting one of
the most lucrative deals in NFL history. The Connecticut deal not
only provides Kraft with an ultra-modern stadium and free land on
which to build a hotel, but guarantees payments for any premium
seating that goes unsold, a potential $175 million subsidy over 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert wanted to look the governor in the eye and know our
season ticket holders were being taken care of,'' Jonathan Kraft
said. ``And Rowland wanted to look Robert in the eye and know that
if he agreed to the deal they were coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Unbowed to any superstition, the two men shook hands on Friday,
Nov. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Next came the job of selling the proposal to state legislators
and getting Kraft's signature on the tentative agreement before
Massachusetts lawmakers woke up and realized their football team
was in the middle of a quarterback sneak.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday, Rowland had already begun quietly debriefing
lawmakers, but some reporters saw Rowland squiring Kraft around the
Legislative Office Building adjacent to the Capitol and word began
to leak of a possible deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's good,'' Sullivan said of Rowland, ``this is what he
does best and that is to make people feel part of a team. But when
he's bad, it's when he goes into a bunker and draws a line in the
sand. I don't see that happening in this case because everyone has
such an interest in making this work. That in itself should keep
everyone ... on track.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartford Mayor Michael Peters, a Democrat, said Rowland's office
kept him informed that talks were ongoing. But he was only apprised
of the details on Wednesday, 24 hours before the press conference
announcing the deal was finalized.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that was fine with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people say to me, `Mayor how come you weren't
involved as much as you should have been because you're the mayor
of the City of Hartford?' Let me tell you something, if I know
somebody's doing the right job and they're working on behalf of the
city, I wouldn't want too many people in that room either for fear
of screwing up the deal,'' Peters said. ``I think the governor
handled it absolutely perfectly. ... I think he's fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rowland was not so well-liked by the Democrats earlier in
his term, when, sworn in at 37 in 1995, he was the state's youngest
governor ever.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Democrats _ then a minority _ were more
combative and Rowland was more conservative, fighting a
minimum-wage increase and campaigning against abortion.
Connecticut, the richest state in the nation per capita, also has
the most stringent welfare reform law, which Rowland touted in
campaign literature. The governor became embroiled in a few
low-rent ethics investigations _ stemming from the state leasing
his wife a Chevy Suburban and two of his children helping
themselves to state-owned camping equipment. But he came through
unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Rowland supports abortion rights and he recently signed a
new $6.10 per-hour minimum wage law. He has also made improving
Bridgeport, New Haven and Hartford _ three of the country's poorest
cities _ a priority much in the way of an urban Democrat. And he
golfs with he leader of the more liberal House of Representatives,
Democratic Speaker Thomas Ritter.
</P>
<P>
   In Ritter's office on the top floor of Connecticut's tallest
building, sits a rendering of a stadium designed in 1993. Five
years ago the Legislature passed bonding for a new stadium but its
attempt to lure the Patriots to Hartford were foiled when Kraft,
who lives in Chestnut Hill, bought the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a lot of time with Kraft (Thursday) and he was really
blown away with how really well we all work,'' Ritter said. ``We're
all in the office. We're joking. He couldn't believe that all of us
were together. That really struck him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland defeated Kennelly earlier this month by stealing her
party's traditional issues, such as education, property tax relief
and improving working-class cities. Basically, the Democrats agree
with his vision, his plan, and his style. There's nothing much left
to fight about anymore, legislators say.
</P>
<P>
   There are some cynics, though, who contend Rowland changes his
mind to fit public opinion. An editorial cartoonist for the
Hartford Courant frequently draws him with a weather vane on his
head. But Rowland has certainly become more moderate with age,
although at 41, he is still the nation's youngest governor.
</P>
<P>
   His political career began in earnest when he was 23, elected to
the Legislature as a Republican from a Democratic district in
blue-collar Waterbury, where he was a Catholic high school
wrestling star.
</P>
<P>
   The Villanova University graduate held the post for four years
before making the leap to Congress, defeating a three-term
incumbent. In 1990, he ran for governor and lost to Lowell P.
Weicker Jr.
</P>
<P>
   But he found a $400,000 private-sector job as a business
consultant and then ran again in 1994. He won. This time, as a
Northeast Republican with broad-based appeal, much like the
Massachusetts Governor Paul Cellucci and his predecessor William
Weld.
</P>
<P>
   That appeal is evident even on the lonely after-hours streets of
Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Said Patrick Smith, a tour guide-interpreter at the old State
House in Hartford: ``I'm not a big supporter of John Rowland. I
never have been. But I'm impressed with what he's done. He's
impressed me as a good businessman, a good negotiator. I'm
impressed with him swaying people to see what Hartford is really
like.''

SEMINOLES BEAT GATORS, 23-12  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Florida Coach Steve Spurrier smugly said
before Saturday's game that winning here wasn't necessarily on his
coaching wish list.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe now it should be.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida State Seminoles (No. 1 in the New York Times's
computer ranking and No. 5 in the Associated Press poll) used a
vise-like defense and several big plays from wide receiver Peter
Warrick to vault past Spurrier's Gators, 23-12, before a Doak
Campbell Stadium record crowd of 81,614.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd got some unexpected pre-game entertainment, when the
two teams scuffled at midfield and three players were ejected.
</P>
<P>
   The victory left Florida State at 11-1 and still in the national
title race, while sending Florida (9-2) home with more shattered
dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier, the most successful coach in Gator history, is now
0-4-1 here. In fact, Florida (No. 6 Times, No. 4 AP) has not won
here since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles, who were behind throughout the first half, moved
ahead to stay early in the third quarter. And the points came
courtesy of a Florida defender.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Outzen threw the ball directly to Gator strong safety
Marquand Manuel, but it squirted through Manuel's hands and was
seized by Warrick, who zigzagged by cornerback Bennie Alexander to
complete a 32-yard touchdown play.
</P>
<P>
   That put Florida State ahead by 13-12, and a trick play finished
off Florida early in the final period. Warrick took a handoff from
running back Jeff Chaney and passed to the wide-open split end, Ron
Dugans, for a 46-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   A 41-yard field goal from Sebastian Janikowski with 4 minutes 31
seconds left was window dressing.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State benefited from the pre-game scuffle, which stoked
the crowd into a screaming mob. Florida's starting senior
cornerback, Tony George, was ejected, while Florida State lost two
players not even listed on the depth chart, linemen Ronald Boldin
and Josh Baggs.
</P>
<P>
   On the game's second play, Seminoles free safety Dexter Jackson
intercepted a Doug Johnson pass and returned it 33 yards for what
appeared to be a touchdown. But cornerback Mario Edwards was
detected holding receiver Natis Karim.
</P>
<P>
   The teams exchanged punts before the Gators found a weakness,
moving 81 yards in just three plays. A 15-yard pass to tight end
Erron Kinney, with 15 yards tacked on for a personal foul, got the
visitors started. The drive ended suddenly, with Johnson looking
right and finding wide receiver Travis McGriff alone for a 50-yard
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators had another opportunity seconds later, but could not
capitalize on Outzen's fumble. The sophomore quarterback, starting
just his second college game, was stripped of the ball by tackle
Reggie McGrew, who was playing despite a sprained ligament in his
lower back.
</P>
<P>
   That set up Florida at the Seminoles' 19-yard line, but a
third-down pass by Johnson was intercepted by Sean Key.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the second quarter, the Seminoles appeared to
benefit from a questionable call. Outzen was sacked by McGrew,
sending the ball bouncing into the end zone. Gators tackle Gerard
Warren fell on it for an apparent touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But several Florida State players landed on Warren and the ball
ended up being cradled by Seminoles tackle Ross Brannon for a
Florida safety.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators did not seem to let that bother them. They promptly
drove to the Seminoles' 5-yard line before settling for Jeff
Chandler's 22-yard field goal and a 12-6 lead.

JONES COULD SALVAGE COWBOYS' GOLDEN MOMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE FISHER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Imagine it: Tony Dorsett and Emmitt Smith,
both 12,000-yard rushers, on the field, together, at the same time!
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate in Cowboys Fantasy Football? Sure. And it could be
the ultimate in reality, too.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the Cowboys whiffed on an opportunity to pair the
two best running backs in their history when Smith surpassed
Dorsett as the franchise's all-time leading rusher. It would have
been a golden moment, a snapshot of a lifetime, had owner Jerry
Jones thought to have Dorsett as his guest at Texas Stadium that
day against the Giants, poised to pass the torch to his successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea why I wasn't invited,'' Dorsett said.
``Normally, that's kind of standard in sports. Billy Sims was there
when Barry Sanders broke his records in Detroit. It's kind of a
snub.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Jones and some members of the previous generations of
Cowboys are back to where they were almost a decade ago, when he
was perceived by old-timers as an egomaniac with no understanding
or respect for the rich history of the Cowboys. The ghosts of Jones
vs. Tom Landry and Jones vs. Tex Schramm are being resurrected by
Jones vs. Dorsett, which has evolved into a game of ``Did Not, Did
So.''
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't Jones invite Dorsett? Jones says, ``I thought it
would be a distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Counters Dorsett: ``He's had movie stars and princes and lots of
friends on the sideline. I don't see how I would've been more \Rof
a distraction\S than them.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Jones: ``We didn't have Drew Pearson there for Michael
Irvin breaking records and we didn't specifically invite Roger
\RStaubach\S when Troy \RAikman\S broke passing records. It just
hasn't been our policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Counters Dorsett: ``We've got two guys with 12,000 yards. That
may be as significant a record as the Cowboys will have.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Jones: ``If I had it to do over again, I would've invited
Tony.''
</P>
<P>
   Counters Dorsett: ``Oh, sure. I'm supposed to trust the man
who's made other promises to me and not kept them? With all the
things that have happened, I have a hard time trusting the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorsett was a business partner in Cowboys Sports Cafe, the
Valley Ranch restaurant that Jones once declared off-limits because
the NFL expressed ``bad element'' concerns about some of the
restaurant's patrons. Dorsett says the ban came only one week after
he'd been assured by Jones that there would be no such measure
taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, Jerry Jones put me out of business,'' Dorsett says.
</P>
<P>
   Personal problems aside, Jones had lots of reasons to avoid
inviting Dorsett to the game, led by his long-held concern for the
perception that he relies on the coattails of the old Cowboys to
hide present-day Cowboys warts.
</P>
<P>
   Personal problems aside, Dorsett had lots of reasons to be at
Texas Stadium on his own. He is, after all, a season-ticket holder.
Staubach was at the game, by his own volition. So were dozens of
other ex-Cowboys who don't need gold-engraved invitations to
attend.
</P>
<P>
   Still, any chasm between old and new is sad, and which side is
more wrong (''Tony's a baby''/''Jerry's a jerk'') is debatable, if
not immaterial. It's understandable that Dorsett wants to be
coddled; that's what professional athletes are accustomed to. And,
it's unfair to accuse Jones of disrespecting the past; of the 10
men in the Ring of Honor, all are old-generation and four were
inducted by Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Can this marriage be saved? Yes. Here's my plan:
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, who could use any edge available for the
Thanksgiving Day game against the talented Vikings, finally extend
the invitation to Dorsett _ and Don Perkins, Calvin Hill, Duane
Thomas and Herschel Walker. And in a nationally televised pregame
ceremony, the six greatest running backs in Cowboys history (not to
mention NFL history) share a joyous and noteworthy spotlight, with
Smith and Dorsett as the centerpieces.
</P>
<P>
   The country receives a heck of a show. The Cowboys receive an
emotional boost. Smith receives his ``torch.'' Dorsett receives his
due. And so do the rest of the fellas. Just outside of camera
range, Jones basks in the feel-good glow. And decadelong wounds are
healed.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry, you have a lot to be thankful for, including Tony Dorsett
and the generations of Cowboys that came before him. So thank him.
Thank them all.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers game 25.8 _ The definition of a breakaway threat,
Minnesota's Robert Smith averages 25.8 yards per touchdown run, the
highest in NFL history among players with at least 20 rushing
touchdowns.
Trivial pursuit When was the last time Marty Schottenheimer, an NFL
head coach for 14 years, lost five consecutive games? Never, until
this season. The Chiefs have dropped consecutive games against New
England, Pittsburgh, the Jets, Seattle and Denver. The Chiefs have
a chance to break the streak today at San Diego, but at 4-6 and
unraveling from the inside, they are in danger of suffering a
losing season _ something else that Schottenheimer's never
experienced.
Quotable ``We have the capability of being the greatest group of
wideouts on one team, ever.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Vikings wide receiver Cris Carter on the receiving trio that
includes himself, rookie Randy Moss and Jake Reed.
Check out ... The officiating fallout from the Cowboys-Cardinals
game. The Cardinals have nobody _ not even the officials who failed
to flag Kevin Smith for interference in the end zone on the final
play of a 35-28 loss _ to blame but themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The three-step review of how the Cardinals screwed up their own
chances in the final seconds:
</P>
<P>
   1. Rob Moore's 58-yard catch-and-run. Once he got to the 5-yard
line, he wanted the touchdown and tried to bull into the end zone,
gaining no yardage against two Cowboys tacklers and wasting
valuable seconds. Had he gotten out of bounds, more than 30 seconds
(and four plays) would have been available to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   2. Jake Plummer's stop-the-clock spike. The clock is down to 20
seconds. The Cowboys defense is scrambling, confused, tired,
scared. I'll never know why offenses don't plan for these
situations. The Cardinals spiked the ball, thus wasting first down.
They were left them with only two plays.
</P>
<P>
   3. Moore vs. Kevin Smith in the end zone. Was it interference?
Who knows? Was Plummer's throw two feet too low? Definitely. Had
Plummer thrown the ball higher, Smith's involvement in the play
would have been incidental, Moore would have scored a touchdown and
the Cardinals would believe the game was pristinely officiated.
AFC Buzz Linebacker Chad Brown has played for the Steelers and the
Seahawks. As the Cowboys try to learn the strengths and weaknesses
of the Seahawks, their Sunday visitors to Texas Stadium, Brown
contrasts and compares. ``The Seahawks are run as a corporation,''
Brown said. ``They're not run like a family, like the Steelers are.
With the Steelers, if \Rowner Dan\S Rooney was out sick on payday,
we didn't get paid because he had to sign the checks. There's
obviously a little higher budget here, and it makes this nice. ...
With the Steelers, you had to turn in your old jock to get a new
jock.'' ... How is the AFC-centric CBS pregame show faring in Fort
Worth-Dallas? Insiders at KTVT/Channel 11 say its locally produced
``In The Huddle'' show featuring Eric Dickerson, Craig James and
Gil Brandt recently earned a 3.0 share. Then on came the network
show, which drew a 2.1 ... Baltimore at Cincinnati: The Bengals,
losers of five consecutive games and seven of their past eight,
bench quarterback Neil O'Donnell, bypass backup Jeff Blake and
start third-stringer Paul Justin. ... Maybe Chiefs players wouldn't
feel free to take cheap shots if, as alleged, coach Marty
Schottenheimer hadn't long ago issued a bounty on Broncos players.
I'm told the NFL investigated such charges last year, and after
Monday night, the league should be motivated to investigate again.
... Denver has outscored opponents 114-13 in first quarters. ...
Look for the Jets to work out a new contract for quarterback Vinny
Testaverde. ... What happened to Tennessee owner Bud Adams'
announced plan to conduct a contest for fans to pick the new name
of his franchise? Instead, Adams has decided to just handle it
himself. Thus, the Tennessee Titans, which Adams says fits his
desire to have the nickname reflect the team's new home. I don't
get it, but welcome to the wacky world of Bud Adams. ... By the
way, Jets at Oilers is actually Titans at Titans (the Jets' 1960-62
nickname vs. the Oilers' future nickname).
NFC Buzz Arizona quarterback Jake Plummer's numbers in his past
three second halves: 44 of 66, 606 yards, four touchdowns and no
interceptions. Sounds great. But if he has ``arrived'' as ``the
next Fran Tarkenton,'' what's he doing down 28-0 in the first half?
Plummer's rating in his past three games is a very good 95.5.
Great, except his rating through Week 7 was a lousy 63.1. ... You
want parity? Green Bay is the only 1997 division champion that won
last Sunday. ... Greg Hill remains the Rams' leading rusher despite
being out since Week 3 with a broken leg. ... Arizona at
Washington: The Redskins played the Cards tough two weeks ago,
losing, 29-27, and have won two consecutive game at home,
outscoring foes 49-17. ... The Cowboys have swept their four
division road games for the first time since 1983. ... Saints at
49ers: San Francisco has outscored New Orleans 87-7 in past three
meetings. ... The 3-7 Lions have not won on Sunday afternoon. Their
three victories have been prime-time games. ... More evidence the
Cardinals don't get it: During last week's game against the
Cowboys, a member of the Bill Bidwill ownership family was a guest
on the Cardinals radio network to announce the club's plans to sell
tickets to any Cardinals home playoff game. I bet the phones didn't
exactly light up; Arizona was behind, 28-7, at the time. ... The
Eagles have only two touchdown catches this season, none of which
were caught by wide receivers. ... The Packers hope to get runner
Dorsey Levens back from injury next month. ... Detroit's Barry
Sanders needs one touchdown to become the sixth player with 100.
... Friends of Steve Mariucci say the 49ers coach is irritated at
how slowly his contract renewal is moving, but the word is he will
get an extension through 2005.

COACHES CAN'T GIVE PLAYERS CREATINE, BUT THEY CAN SELL IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STACY FEDUCIA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Coaches cannot give a nutritional supplement
like creatine to their student-athletes, according to University
Interscholastic League rules.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean they can't ``sell'' it.
</P>
<P>
   The league's amateur rule prevents athletes from receiving
everything from T-shirts to free meals, but athletes may
voluntarily purchase those items from boosters or coaches or
whomever is selling.
</P>
<P>
   And coaches can sell those things, including creatine, at a
profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make it available to the kids because we get it at cost and
then the kids can buy it for less than they'd have to pay at a
health food store,'' said Pottsboro head football coach Rick
Cullum, who estimated that 25 percent of the players in his Class
3A program take creatine. ``We don't make a profit off it. In fact,
we probably lose money. I don't think you should make a profit off
the kids, but I know people who do.''
</P>
<P>
   Some representatives at the annual UIL Legislative Council
meeting last month don't think coaches should sell it at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a question of whether creatine is legal or illegal,
but the role of the coach in promoting it,'' UIL associate athletic
director Cynthia Doyle said. ``Our position is that coaches should
not provide anything to students in this manner. If a coach cannot
dispense aspirin to students, why should they be providing these
products?''
</P>
<P>
   The use of creatine and other nutritional supplements, including
the controversial androstenedione, is not prohibited by the
National Federation of State High School Associations.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the federation issued a position statement in August
urging coaches to dispense supplements ``with extreme caution and
in accordance with policies developed in consultation with parents,
health-care professionals and senior administrative personnel of
the school or school district.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing health and safety precautions, liability risks and
ethical concerns, the federation's statement says ``school
personnel and coaches should never supply, recommend or permit the
use of any drug, medication or food supplement solely for
performance-enhancing purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the UIL abides by National Federation rules, the league
began the process of formulating a similar, if not stronger,
position at its annual Legislative Council meeting last month.
</P>
<P>
   The debate that emerged was not about creatine, but about the
fact that coaches can sell it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is the long-term effects of creatine, which hasn't
been out long enough to have concrete, scientific studies on it,''
explained Granbury athletic trainer Mark Gilbert, president of the
Southwest Athletic Trainers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Especially when the products are not regulated by the Food and
Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Supplement supporters contend that, in rural areas, students
wouldn't have access to the products if coaches couldn't distribute
them. Like Pottsboro's Cullum, they say that, without the discounts
coaches receive for resale, the high retail price would put
supplements out of reach for some students.
</P>
<P>
   But if a coach is selling the product ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are not people who have the right to say no to the
commanding adult,'' Don Hendrix, Crosby schools superintendent and
UIL athletic committee member, told ``USA Today''.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, individual school districts decide whether coaches
can sell supplements to their students.
</P>
<P>
   Following the UIL meeting, athletic committee chairwoman Dr.
Jill Shugart, the Garland schools superintendent, returned to her
district and issued a notice prohibiting district coaches and
trainers from selling supplements.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the only action taken by the UIL is asking coaches to
refrain from distributing the substances from an ethical
standpoint, the UIL's Doyle said.
</P>
<P>
   The league isn't asking students to stop taking supplements;
they're merely asking coaches to stop selling them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have we lost perspective when we put so much emphasis on
winning that kids can no longer compete without going above and
beyond a balanced diet?'' Doyle asked. ``Does everything have to be
legislated before coaches see that \Rselling supplements\S is not
the right thing to do?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer should be apparent.

COACHES CAN'T GIVE PLAYERS CREATINE, BUT THEY CAN SELL IT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Coaches cannot give a nutritional supplement
like creatine to their student-athletes, according to University
Interscholastic League rules.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean they can't ``sell'' it.
</P>
<P>
   The league's amateur rule prevents athletes from receiving
everything from T-shirts to free meals, but athletes may
voluntarily purchase those items from boosters or coaches or
whomever is selling.
</P>
<P>
   And coaches can sell those things, including creatine, at a
profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make it available to the kids because we get it at cost and
then the kids can buy it for less than they'd have to pay at a
health food store,'' said Pottsboro head football coach Rick
Cullum, who estimated that 25 percent of the players in his Class
3A program take creatine. ``We don't make a profit off it. In fact,
we probably lose money. I don't think you should make a profit off
the kids, but I know people who do.''
</P>
<P>
   Some representatives at the annual UIL Legislative Council
meeting last month don't think coaches should sell it at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a question of whether creatine is legal or illegal,
but the role of the coach in promoting it,'' UIL associate athletic
director Cynthia Doyle said. ``Our position is that coaches should
not provide anything to students in this manner. If a coach cannot
dispense aspirin to students, why should they be providing these

JONES COULD SALVAGE COWBOYS' GOLDEN MOMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE FISHER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Imagine it: Tony Dorsett and Emmitt Smith,
both 12,000-yard rushers, on the field, together, at the same time!
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate in Cowboys Fantasy Football? Sure. And it could be
the ultimate in reality, too.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the Cowboys whiffed on an opportunity to pair the
two best running backs in their history when Smith surpassed
Dorsett as the franchise's all-time leading rusher. It would have
been a golden moment, a snapshot of a lifetime, had owner Jerry
Jones thought to have Dorsett as his guest at Texas Stadium that
day against the Giants, poised to pass the torch to his successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea why I wasn't invited,'' Dorsett said.
``Normally, that's kind of standard in sports. Billy Sims was there
when Barry Sanders broke his records in Detroit. It's kind of a
snub.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Jones and some members of the previous generations of
Cowboys are back to where they were almost a decade ago, when he
was perceived by old-timers as an egomaniac with no understanding
or respect for the rich history of the Cowboys. The ghosts of Jones
vs. Tom Landry and Jones vs. Tex Schramm are being resurrected by
Jones vs. Dorsett, which has evolved into a game of ``Did Not, Did
So.''
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't Jones invite Dorsett? Jones says, ``I thought it
would be a distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Counters Dorsett: ``He's had movie stars and princes and lots of
friends on the sideline. I don't see how I would've been more \Rof
a distraction\S than them.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Jones: ``We didn't have Drew Pearson there for Michael
Irvin breaking records and we didn't specifically invite Roger
\RStaubach\S when Troy \RAikman\S broke passing records. It just
hasn't been our policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Counters Dorsett: ``We've got two guys with 12,000 yards. That
may be as significant a record as the Cowboys will have.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Jones: ``If I had it to do over again, I would've invited
Tony.''
</P>
<P>
   Counters Dorsett: ``Oh, sure. I'm supposed to trust the man
who's made other promises to me and not kept them? With all the
things that have happened, I have a hard time trusting the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorsett was a business partner in Cowboys Sports Cafe, the
Valley Ranch restaurant that Jones once declared off-limits because
the NFL expressed ``bad element'' concerns about some of the
restaurant's patrons. Dorsett says the ban came only one week after
he'd been assured by Jones that there would be no such measure
taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, Jerry Jones put me out of business,'' Dorsett says.
</P>
<P>
   Personal problems aside, Jones had lots of reasons to avoid
inviting Dorsett to the game, led by his long-held concern for the
perception that he relies on the coattails of the old Cowboys to
hide present-day Cowboys warts.
</P>
<P>
   Personal problems aside, Dorsett had lots of reasons to be at
Texas Stadium on his own. He is, after all, a season-ticket holder.
Staubach was at the game, by his own volition. So were dozens of
other ex-Cowboys who don't need gold-engraved invitations to
attend.
</P>
<P>
   Still, any chasm between old and new is sad, and which side is
more wrong (''Tony's a baby''/''Jerry's a jerk'') is debatable, if
not immaterial. It's understandable that Dorsett wants to be
coddled; that's what professional athletes are accustomed to. And,
it's unfair to accuse Jones of disrespecting the past; of the 10
men in the Ring of Honor, all are old-generation and four were
inducted by Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Can this marriage be saved? Yes. Here's my plan:
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, who could use any edge available for the
Thanksgiving Day game against the talented Vikings, finally extend
the invitation to Dorsett _ and Don Perkins, Calvin Hill, Duane
Thomas and Herschel Walker. And in a nationally televised pregame
ceremony, the six greatest running backs in Cowboys history (not to
mention NFL history) share a joyous and noteworthy spotlight, with
Smith and Dorsett as the centerpieces.
</P>
<P>
   The country receives a heck of a show. The Cowboys receive an
emotional boost. Smith receives his ``torch.'' Dorsett receives his
due. And so do the rest of the fellas. Just outside of camera
range, Jones basks in the feel-good glow. And decadelong wounds are
healed.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry, you have a lot to be thankful for, including Tony Dorsett
and the generations of Cowboys that came before him. So thank him.
Thank them all.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers game 25.8 _ The definition of a breakaway threat,
Minnesota's Robert Smith averages 25.8 yards per touchdown run, the
highest in NFL history among players with at least 20 rushing
touchdowns.
Trivial pursuit When was the last time Marty Schottenheimer, an NFL
head coach for 14 years, lost five consecutive games? Never, until
this season. The Chiefs have dropped consecutive games against New
England, Pittsburgh, the Jets, Seattle and Denver. The Chiefs have
a chance to break the streak today at San Diego, but at 4-6 and
unraveling from the inside, they are in danger of suffering a
losing season _ something else that Schottenheimer's never
experienced.
Quotable ``We have the capability of being the greatest group of
wideouts on one team, ever.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Vikings wide receiver Cris Carter on the receiving trio that
includes himself, rookie Randy Moss and Jake Reed.
Check out ... The officiating fallout from the Cowboys-Cardinals
game. The Cardinals have nobody _ not even the officials who failed
to flag Kevin Smith for interference in the end zone on the final
play of a 35-28 loss _ to blame but themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The three-step review of how the Cardinals screwed up their own
chances in the final seconds:
</P>
<P>
   1. Rob Moore's 58-yard catch-and-run. Once he got to the 5-yard
line, he wanted the touchdown and tried to bull into the end zone,
gaining no yardage against two Cowboys tacklers and wasting
valuable seconds. Had he gotten out of bounds, more than 30 seconds
(and four plays) would have been available to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   2. Jake Plummer's stop-the-clock spike. The clock is down to 20
seconds. The Cowboys defense is scrambling, confused, tired,
scared. I'll never know why offenses don't plan for these
situations. The Cardinals spiked the ball, thus wasting first down.
They were left them with only two plays.
</P>
<P>
   3. Moore vs. Kevin Smith in the end zone. Was it interference?
Who knows? Was Plummer's throw two feet too low? Definitely. Had
Plummer thrown the ball higher, Smith's involvement in the play
would have been incidental, Moore would have scored a touchdown and
the Cardinals would believe the game was pristinely officiated.
AFC Buzz Linebacker Chad Brown has played for the Steelers and the
Seahawks. As the Cowboys try to learn the strengths and weaknesses
of the Seahawks, their Sunday visitors to Texas Stadium, Brown
contrasts and compares. ``The Seahawks are run as a corporation,''
Brown said. ``They're not run like a family, like the Steelers are.
With the Steelers, if \Rowner Dan\S Rooney was out sick on payday,
we didn't get paid because he had to sign the checks. There's
obviously a little higher budget here, and it makes this nice. ...
With the Steelers, you had to turn in your old jock to get a new
jock.'' ... How is the AFC-centric CBS pregame show faring in Fort
Worth-Dallas? Insiders at KTVT/Channel 11 say its locally produced
``In The Huddle'' show featuring Eric Dickerson, Craig James and
Gil Brandt recently earned a 3.0 share. Then on came the network
show, which drew a 2.1 ... Baltimore at Cincinnati: The Bengals,
losers of five consecutive games and seven of their past eight,
bench quarterback Neil O'Donnell, bypass backup Jeff Blake and
start third-stringer Paul Justin. ... Maybe Chiefs players wouldn't
feel free to take cheap shots if, as alleged, coach Marty
Schottenheimer hadn't long ago issued a bounty on Broncos players.
I'm told the NFL investigated such charges last year, and after
Monday night, the league should be motivated to investigate again.
... Denver has outscored opponents 114-13 in first quarters. ...
Look for the Jets to work out a new contract for quarterback Vinny
Testaverde. ... What happened to Tennessee owner Bud Adams'
announced plan to conduct a contest for fans to pick the new name
of his franchise? Instead, Adams has decided to just handle it
himself. Thus, the Tennessee Titans, which Adams says fits his
desire to have the nickname reflect the team's new home. I don't
get it, but welcome to the wacky world of Bud Adams. ... By the
way, Jets at Oilers is actually Titans at Titans (the Jets' 1960-62
nickname vs. the Oilers' future nickname).
NFC Buzz Arizona quarterback Jake Plummer's numbers in his past
three second halves: 44 of 66, 606 yards, four touchdowns and no
interceptions. Sounds great. But if he has ``arrived'' as ``the
next Fran Tarkenton,'' what's he doing down 28-0 in the first half?
Plummer's rating in his past three games is a very good 95.5.
Great, except his rating through Week 7 was a lousy 63.1. ... You
want parity? Green Bay is the only 1997 division champion that won
last Sunday. ... Greg Hill remains the Rams' leading rusher despite
being out since Week 3 with a broken leg. ... Arizona at
Washington: The Redskins played the Cards tough two weeks ago,
losing, 29-27, and have won two consecutive game at home,
outscoring foes 49-17. ... The Cowboys have swept their four
division road games for the first time since 1983. ... Saints at
49ers: San Francisco has outscored New Orleans 87-7 in past three
meetings. ... The 3-7 Lions have not won on Sunday afternoon. Their
three victories have been prime-time games. ... More evidence the
Cardinals don't get it: During last week's game against the
Cowboys, a member of the Bill Bidwill ownership family was a guest
on the Cardinals radio network to announce the club's plans to sell
tickets to any Cardinals home playoff game. I bet the phones didn't
exactly light up; Arizona was behind, 28-7, at the time. ... The
Eagles have only two touchdown catches this season, none of which
were caught by wide receivers. ... The Packers hope to get runner
Dorsey Levens back from injury next month. ... Detroit's Barry
Sanders needs one touchdown to become the sixth player with 100.
... Friends of Steve Mariucci say the 49ers coach is irritated at
how slowly his contract renewal is moving, but the word is he will
get an extension through 2005.

DIAMONDBACKS GAIN IN JOHNSON DERBY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Signing Todd Stottlemyre has made the Arizona Diamondbacks a
serious threat to sign free-agent pitcher Randy Johnson. In fact,
Arizona may be the clear-cut favorite. If so, the Rangers could be
hurting.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks' two obstacles going into the process were
being in the National League and being a last-place team. Johnson
told the Rangers he wants to play on an American League team that's
competitive and is located west of the Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks are still in the National League, but signing
Stottlemyre sends Johnson a signal they're serious about winning as
quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to do things to become competitive sooner rather
than later,'' Diamondbacks owner Jerry Colangelo told Arizona
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks' main advantage remains Johnson's residence in
a Phoenix suburb and his desire to pitch close to home. Johnson has
three children, and sources close to him say he's serious when he
talks about the importance of being near his family.
</P>
<P>
   Economics will also be a factor, but the second-year
Diamondbacks have yet to flinch in that area. Baseball officials
are still amazed Colangelo gave Jay Bell $34 million over five
years last year when nobody else was offering anything close to
that.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson spent the weekend in Southern California visiting the
Angels and the Dodgers. But the Angels are getting close to signing
Mo Vaughn, which would likely take them out of the running for
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, backed by Fox television's deep pockets, should
make a strong run at Johnson, especially if they can trade Eric
Karros or Gary Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers remain in the running, but general manager Doug
Melvin may have to start looking at alternatives. There are few
that are attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Belcher, Pete Schourek and Bob Tewksbury are among the best
of the remaining free agents, and Ismael Valdes, Pat Hentgen and
Joey Hamilton are the pitchers most likely to be available for
trade. But that means giving up players in return.
Random observations: Rangers minor-league outfielder Mike Zywica
won the Arizona Fall League batting championship with a .330
batting average. He also led the league in runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   Zywica would earn a bigger honor if he ever makes it to the
major leagues. Of the thousands of players who have played in the
big leagues, Zywica would be absolutely last alphabetically. That
would put him in exclusive company. Hank Aaron is first.
</P>
<P>
   The most exciting competition in the off-season is for the
coveted title of Worst Contract Given Out. Brian Bohanon's
three-year, $9 million deal with the Colorado Rockies was the early
leader but was quickly overtaken by the Boston Red Sox. Baseball is
still stunned that Jose Offerman was given $26 million over four
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, being publicly criticized in New York for their
interest in Albert Belle, have increased their efforts to re-sign
Bernie Williams. There is a five-year, $60 million offer on the
table, and Williams' bargaining power decreased when the Dodgers
signed Devon White and the Rockies re-signed Darryl Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan, who picked a great time to have a career year, has
narrowed his choices to the Yankees, Mets, Orioles and the Braves.
Look for the Orioles to win if they re-sign Rafael Palmeiro, too.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Cardinals and Colorado Rockies are both interested
in Kevin Brown, but both aren't enthusiastic about meeting his
demand for a six-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   If Belle dumps the White Sox and goes elsewhere, that will give
them the money to re-sign popular third baseman Robin Ventura.
Otherwise, they'll avoid big-name free agents and stick to their
youth movement.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Rogers, in exchange for dropping his demand to be traded,
is talking about a deal in which he pitches for the Oakland
Athletics next year then gets to become a free agent. He currently
has an option for 2000 that would kick in if he pitches 160 innings
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians have talked to Toronto general manager Gord Ash
about Roger Clemens, but general manager John Hart told Cleveland
reporters, ``I asked Gord if he was going to move him and he said,
`Not at this time. We're building around him.' Gord made it very
clear they're not going to move him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Twins, who must cut their payroll to $17 million,
have been approached by a number of clubs about Brad Radke, who
general manager Terry Ryan said is not available.
</P>
<P>
   If Ricky Bottalico comes back strong from last year's elbow
problems, then the Cardinals have made a terrific deal in getting
him for outfielder Ron Gant.
</P>
<P>
   Look for Brian Giles to emerge as an offensive force if the
Pirates allow him to play every day. They got him cheaply by giving
reliever Ricardo Rincon to the Indians.

BAYLOR'S LATE RALLY FOILS UTA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DARRIN SCHEID 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Baylor basketball players said they could not
easily handle another close loss, not for a third time and not
again at the Ferrell Center.
</P>
<P>
   Down the stretch, UT-Arlington did its part to help out the home
team yesterday in Baylor's 64-59 men's victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks blew a four-point lead with 3 minutes, 46 seconds
left by going scoreless on five consecutive possessions. UTA (0-1)
went 1-for-4 from the free-throw line in the closing minutes, and
junior forward Dewayne Marable finished a 1-for-13 day by missing
two outside shots in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor (1-2), after close losses against Arkansas State and
Louisiana Tech, picked up its first victory with 1,405 in
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   UTA let slip away what would have been its first Division I,
season-opening victory since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, we had our chances,'' UTA coach Eddie McCarter
said. ``Down the stretch, we've got to make plays, we've got to hit
shots and we have to make our free throws. We didn't do those
things.''
</P>
<P>
   UTA was down 39-30 early in the second half before fighting back
to 50-49, coming within one on a Marable 18-footer.
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks forward Donald Harris hit a breakaway layup and was
fouled on UTA's next possession. His free throw was good, and UTA
took a 52-50 lead with 5:30 left. Another Harris layup with 3:46
left made it 56-52.
</P>
<P>
   The game switched in Baylor's favor during a one-minute stretch
that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Harris fouled out at the 2:37 mark, and Baylor guard Tevis
Stukes took a pass from Kish Lewis and nailed a 23-foot jumper to
pull within 57-56. Baylor's defense took over from there, and the
Bears went 8-for-10 from the line in the final 1:30.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got down, we didn't go up in the shell in this game
like we have in the other two,'' Stukes said. ``We had to fight
hard. I wanted the ball in my hands in the that situation. Win or
lose, I want the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The pass from Lewis on the Stokes 3-pointer was an example of
how Lewis, a 6-foot-7 senior, hurt UTA all day.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis finished with 13 rebounds and 20 points on 7-for-13
shooting. Stukes had 17, and Jamie Kendrick scored 10 as Baylor
outrebounded UTA, 44-31.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Washington led UTA with 20 points; Harris scored 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this was the worst game we've played of the three so
far,'' Baylor coach Harry Miller said. ``I saw some good things,
but I'm not seeing any consistency.''

<P>
   It was several weeks before the official announcement that
University of Texas running back Ricky Williams would be the Doak
Walker Award winner last December when Darrell Royal picked up the
phone and called the Doaker himself.
</P>
<P>
   Royal, knowing his old friend was probably wincing at the sight
of Ricky's dreadlocks, had a specific reason for his call. He
wanted to assure Doak that this kid was something special, both as
a player and as a person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dunno,'' Walker said, unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm voting for him,'' Royal replied. ``I just wanted you to
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, at the awards ceremony, Walker and his wife, Skeeter,
were captivated by Williams. After Walker was paralyzed in that
terrible skiing accident, Skeeter said Williams wrote or called
every week until her husband died.
</P>
<P>
   This story comes from Texas assistant athletic director Bill
Little, who got it from the horse's mouth, Royal himself. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The only flaw we've seen is that he can't hit the curveball.''
_ Terry Bradway, Kansas City Royals head of personnel and scouting
director, quoted in last week's issue of ``Sports Illustrated'' and
referring to Williams' going-nowhere baseball career in the
Phillies' farm system. ...
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of ``SI'', take a look at pages 10-11 in this
week's Leading Off section. No way anyone can look at that sequence
of four photos and not understand that the Cowboys' Kevin Smith was
guilty of flagrant pass interference and/or defensive holding on
the Cardinals' Rob Moore on the final play of last Sunday's victory
against Arizona. End of debate. ... Revo's Insider of the Week To
those who tried to compare Will Clark's departure for three games
from the Rangers at the end of May and the Rangers' subsequent
explanation that it was a ``personal matter'' with the cover-up of
the Michael Irvin scissors affair at training camp in Wichita Falls
in August, hope you read last Sunday's story about Clark's son,
Trey, being diagnosed as autistic.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Clark abruptly left the team in Tampa Bay and
returned to Texas to be with his family. ``That day he came to me
in my office and told me he had to go back to Texas,'' manager
Johnny Oates says, ``is the only time I've ever seen Will cry.''...
</P>
<P>
   How did American League rookie of the year Ben Grieve first
learn to hit? When he was 2, father Tom handed him a Wiffle Ball
bat, blew up balloons and let the toddler start swinging. ``He
started to hit left-handed,'' Tom, now the Rangers' TV analyst,
recalls. ``We didn't teach him and we didn't stop him.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Former Mavs media guru Kevin Sullivan, under a new arrangement
with Ross Perot Jr., says he'll stay on the company payroll while
actually working for the 2012 Olympic Committee helping put Dallas'
bid together. Longtime assistant Tony Fay replaces Sullivan with
the Mavs. ...
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, there's speculation that 42-year-old quarterback
Warren Moon needs to get his act together again soon _ like today
against the Cowboys _ or find himself riding the bench for the rest
of the season with his $5 million nonguaranteed contract for next
season a moot point. ...
</P>
<P>
   Former Cowboys linebacker Darrin Smith will start today for the
Seahawks and brushes off suggestions that his former team's 7-3
record is merely a product of playing in the weak NFC East.
``They've beaten the teams they were supposed to beat, with the
exception of Chicago,'' Smith notes. ``They beat three teams we
beat \RArizona, Philadelphia, Washington\S, so if you say anything
\Rbad\S about them, what does that say about us?''...
</P>
<P>
   NBA super agent David Falk, responding to commissioner David
Stern's charges that he and other agents are at least part of the
problem behind the labor dispute that threatens to shelve the
season: ``There's a misconception that I'm running the thing, but
I've barely lifted a finger. Now, of course, I'm going to get
involved.'' That is not good news. ...
</P>
<P>
   And Falk on client Michael Jordan's involvement in the labor
negotiations: ``I've heard that some people feel these negotiations
will lure Michael to keep playing. I think his involvement has
given him an added stature in the league, if that's even possible.
In any case, Michael is too intelligent to let labor negotiations
determine whether he comes back or not.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   The ``St. Louis Post Dispatch'' says Stars winger Brett Hull
turned down a chance to play in Chicago at the advice of former
Blues general manager Ron Caron, who was paraphrased in the
newspaper, saying, ``\RBlackhawks'\S Owner Bill Wirtz was erratic,
rookie coach Dirk Graham was untested and the lineup was a mess.''
...
</P>
<P>
   Why is it that when the police are dead wrong about something _
like mistakenly arresting the Hampton University women's basketball
coach, her husband and her assistant for running an alleged con in
a Lubbock Wal-Mart parking lot _ they have such a hard time
apologizing? Fear of lawsuits, perhaps? Wrong is wrong, but the
Lubbock police will let the city's mayor try to soothe the hurt
feelings while maintaining that they were just doing their jobs.
...
</P>
<P>
   Former Rangers pitching coach Tom House has interviewed for the
pitching coach's job in San Diego, now that Dave Stewart has left.
House has spent the past couple of years working for the Padres as
their international consultant, mostly in Japan. ...
</P>
<P>
   OK, so we're all in agreement that the Rangers' Juan Gonzalez
was the American League's MVP in 1998, and Sammy Sosa was the
National League's MVP. Now we can we also all agree that
``baseball's'' MVP was the Cardinals' Mark McGwire? I believe ``70
home runs'' trumps any argument to the contrary. ...
</P>
<P>
   Our national football writer, Wendell Barnhouse, had faxed a
letter to Kansas State coach Bill Snyder after last weekend's
K-State-Nebraska game pointing out the unfairness of allowing
quarterback Michael Bishop to speak to only ``Sports Illustrated''
after the game. Much to Barnhouse's surprise, Snyder phoned him
personally to apologize and then, at his weekly press conference
Tuesday, apologized to the writers there and brought Bishop in for
interviews.
Revo's rimshots
</P>
<P>
   Let me get this straight: Ken Caminiti turned down a three-year,
$21 million offer from Detroit to accept a two-year, $9.5 million
offer with Houston? Either Caminiti thought the Tigers were paying
with Canadian dollars or he flunked Business 101.
</P>
<P>
   Had a pleasant enough trip to Lubbock last weekend for the
Texas-Texas Tech game, but then, I wasn't hanging around the local
Wal-Mart, either, thank heavens.
</P>
<P>
   Spotted in Vegas, with a bandage on his hand: Dennis Rodman.
Friends say not to worry, it's just a sprain to his shooting hand,
and when it comes to rolling dice, he's ambidextrous.
</P>
<P>
   John Blake's fate may be decided when University of Oklahoma
regents meet today in Norman. No, he won't be asking Troy Aikman to
appear as a character witness.
</P>
<P>
   _ Old buds Bill Parcells and Jimmy Johnson conspiring to share
information about injured Patriots receiver Terry Glenn? Nah. They
wouldn't do that, would they? Not where anyone could ever prove it,
they wouldn't.

UNT WINS, BUT MISSES ON SHARE OF BIG WEST TITLE

<P>
   DENTON, Texas _ As soon as North Texas tight end Brian Futrell
recovered a New Mexico State on-side kick to secure a 19-11 victory
yesterday, the Eagles players turned their attention to Boise,
Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles became the biggest fans of the Boise State Broncos
this side of Idaho. With a Boise State victory against Idaho, North
Texas (3-8 overall, 3-2 Big West Conference) would have earned a
four-way share of the Big West title and would have owned the
tiebreaker over the other three teams for a possible bid in the
Humanitarian Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Broncos fan right now, big-time,'' UNT senior center
Phillip Armour said immediately after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Said UNT linebacker Jeff Rodgers: ``Most of us will go to our
apartments right now and watch the ticker on ESPN2 and see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen. Idaho edged Boise State, 36-35, in overtime,
making a two-point conversion that won the Vandals (8-3, 4-1) the
Big West title and the Humanitarian Bowl berth.
</P>
<P>
   For North Texas, the leftovers were not so bad. Before 7,432
fans at Fouts Field, the Eagles played possibly their best
defensive game of the season in defeating the Aggies and, as a
result, tied Nevada for second place in the Big West _ its best
finish since the school joined the conference in 1996. The Eagles
were picked to finish last.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did what we could today,'' UNT coach Darrell Dickey said
after finishing his first season at the helm. ``It is something for
us to build on _ finishing as high as we did in the conference.''
</P>
<P>
   The UNT defense held the Aggies (3-8, 1-4), ranked No. 7 in the
country in rushing offense and No. 13 in total offense, to their
second lowest scoring output of the season. The Eagles also forced
four turnovers, which matched the defense's best of the season, and
stopped New Mexico State twice in the second half on fourth-down
plays inside the UNT 11-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   North Texas limited New Mexico State running back Denvis Manns,
one of just three Division I-A players to rush for more than 1,000
yards in four different seasons, to 131 yards. UNT running back
Ja'Quay Wilburn ran for 162 yards on 26 carries and also caught a
26-yard touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've faced the best \Rrunning backs\S in the country, and he
\RManns\S was another good back,'' said UNT linebacker Jeff
Rodgers, who tied free safety Phillip Littlejohn with a team-high
nine tackles. ``But I've got all the confidence in the world in our
defense, especially against the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this was probably our best effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Big plays helped the Eagles build a 16-3 halftime lead. A
41-yard pass from Chase Corley to receiver Kendrick Hollie set up a
29-yard Garrett Courtney field goal to tie the score at 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles got the ball back at the Aggies' 29-yard line after
sophomore Derek Gordon, a Marcus High School graduate, blocked an
Andy Kohl punt _ Gordon's second punt block in two games. Three
plays later, Wilburn turned a simple dump-off pass along the right
sideline into a 26-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   On the Eagles' next drive, Wilburn ripped off a 48-yard run that
set up another Courtney field goal, and Littlejohn set up
Courtney's third of four field goals with an interception of K.C.
Enzminger.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw the ball right to me,'' Littlejohn said. ``That was a
Larry Brown pick.''
</P>
<P>
   North Texas' average starting position in the first half was the
Aggies' 45-yard line.
Extra points
</P>
<P>
   North Texas has won its final home game of the season for the
past six years. ... UNT blocked a punt, blocked a field goal and
recovered a pooch kick against the Aggies. All came in the first
half.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ She remembers three shots, and then the blood
splattering the passengers in the presidential motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   As the convertible limousine raced to Parkland Hospital that
horrible day in Dallas, Nellie Connally instinctively pulled her
wounded husband, Gov. John Connally, into her lap. She whispered
reassuringly in his ear, not knowing if he was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be still, it's all right, be still, it's all right,'' she told
him, unmindful of her own safety. She was certain that President
Kennedy, who had been sitting in the back seat with Jacqueline
Kennedy, was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Kennedy was saying, `Jack, Jack, they have killed my
husband. I have his brains in my hand,' '' Nellie Connally wrote in
her account of Nov. 22, 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five years later, Connally recalls the ride in the
motorcade as if it happened yesterday. There are no tears or
awkward silences. She has no difficulty finding the words. She
knows the story by heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a strange little person. I've lived an exciting, busy
life, and I never look back,'' she said recently, sitting on a
favorite sofa in her apartment overlooking the Galleria in Houston.
``John Connally would march forward, and there was me right behind.
For months after the assassination it was a constant for us, but
you can't dwell on something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans remain fascinated with the Kennedy assassination and
will commemorate its 35th anniversary tomorrow. Although the
findings of the Warren Commission determined that Lee Harvey Oswald
was the sole gunman, the House Select Committee on Assassinations
said in 1979 that Oswald had an accomplice who fired but missed.
And John Connally, who died June 15, 1993, at age 75, said he
believed that shots came from two directions.
</P>
<P>
   The conspiracy theories continue to burn like the eternal flame
at John Kennedy's grave site.
</P>
<P>
   Nellie Connally, however, dismisses talk of a conspiracy. She
had a front-row seat to history, she said. Who would know better
than she about what happened that day?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe there was a conspiracy,'' she said. ``It was a
terrible, awful, heinous act, but it is what I always thought it
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Connally's recollections of the day are supported by the diary
she kept of the Kennedys' visit to Texas. It was written days after
the assassination, while her husband recuperated at the Governor's
Mansion in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The diary notes were filed and forgotten until 1993, the 30th
anniversary of President Kennedy's death.
</P>
<P>
   Now 79, Idanell ``Nellie'' Brill Connally is a steel magnolia of
Texas, engaging and resilient, a survivor who has not let the
tragic events of November 1993 become a burden. President Kennedy
would probably have said she has vigor, one of his favorite words,
which became part of the everyday American vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   As the nation and much of the world mourned the death of a young
president, keeping vigil in front of their TV sets for three days,
the Connallys endured their own ordeal. It was after John Connally
was released from Parkland and began recuperating at the Governor's
Mansion that Nellie Connally impulsively chronicled the events of
Nov. 21 and 22 on a note pad.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote about the Kennedys' arrival in San Antonio for the
start of a whirlwind, 48-hour Texas trip that took them to Fort
Worth the evening of Nov. 21. The Connallys had lived in Fort Worth
during the 1950s and early '60s, and the president spent his last
night there at the old Hotel Texas, now the Radisson Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   The trip was scheduled to end the evening of Nov. 22 with a
reception given by the governor in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Connally noted that Jacqueline Kennedy was dressed in a white
suit when she arrived. Connally was pleased that she had chosen a
different color. On Nov. 22, however, she and the first lady both
wore pink, a fashion faux pas that became a footnote in history.
</P>
<P>
   Her notes focused on the motorcade and how pleased she was that
the Kennedys were receiving such a warm reception in Dallas. The
Connallys were seated in front of the Kennedys as the motorcade
entered Dealey Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``On that day, Texans were being good and the Kennedys were
being good. I was like a mother with her children behaving,''
Connally said. ``I said, `Mr. President, you can't say that Dallas
doesn't love you.' That was just seconds before there was a loud
noise. I looked back at the president and knew something bad
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   One shot, then a second and a third were fired, shattering the
festive air in Dallas, Connally said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can argue with me as long as they want. The first shot
hit the president. The second hit John. The third shot ... and my
eyes saw bloody matter in bits all over the car,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never occurred to me that anything could happen to me.''
</P>
<P>
   At the hospital, she worried that the governor would be
neglected while surgeons worked feverishly on the president. And
she empathized with Jacqueline Kennedy's loss even before the
official announcement of President Kennedy's death. MORE &QL;

   HOUSTON: President Kennedy's death. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Connally placed her notes in a file drawer and did not refer to
them until 1993, when the Sixth Floor Museum in the old School Book
Depository was to be dedicated. The notes are now at the Lyndon B.
Johnson Library in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The 30th anniversary of the assassination was her first trip to
Dealey Plaza since that fateful day. It was a time made more
poignant because John Connally had died that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it out and it was good,'' she said of her notes. ``I
was surprised that it was so easy to write what I was thinking. I
didn't write them for you or the country. I wrote them for all the
future generations of Connallys. I wanted them to know what their
grandmother, their great-grandmother felt.''
</P>
<P>
   The diary notes are indelibly etched in her memory.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled the scene at Parkland when John Connally was taken
to Emergency Room 2 and the president was rushed into Emergency
Room 1. Nellie Connally waited in a small room adjacent to the one
occupied by her husband. There were no windows; for her, no outside
world.

   ``I was preoccupied with the recovery of John Connally,'' she
said. ``I wanted him to live and I wanted them to find the person
who did this terrible thing. It's hard to believe something like
this happened in our country. It bothers me that the president was
assassinated in my state. We had a tough time getting through
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Connally said she had little rest that weekend despite being
given sleeping pills by doctors. She said she was shocked when she
saw her husband on life support, tubes protruding from his arms and
legs. There were concerns even when surgeons said he was out of
danger and moved him to a two-room suite, with one room reserved
for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``They covered the windows with 3-inch steel in my bedroom,
too,'' she said. ``They painted other windows in the building
black. That terrified me more. For the first time in my life, I was
worried about the safety of my family. It occurred to me that it
would be easy to hurt us. The governor used to say, `You can escape
a lot of things, but you can't escape a gun.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the hours after the shootings, she talked to Defense
Secretary Robert McNamara and to Lyndon Johnson, a family friend
and the new president. She did not have a chance to speak to
Jacqueline Kennedy. But her son, John B. Connally III, then 17,
persuaded Nellie Connally to write a note he would deliver to the
Kennedys at the president's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Nellie Connally stayed at her husband's side at Parkland.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the funeral, the Kennedys stopped their car when they
saw Mr. Johnson, and got out to talk to the president,'' she said.
``My son, John, gave Jackie the note I wrote, and Jackie told him,
`John, the one good thing to come out of this is that your father
will live.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Connally said she cannot remember what she wrote in her note,
but 10 days later, she received ``a very sweet note'' from
Jacqueline Kennedy, who died of cancer May 19, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   She is amused and bewildered by Americans' continued interest in
the assassination, fueled by movies such as Oliver Stone's
``J.F.K.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every November my phone starts ringing,'' she said. ``The
calls used to be for John Connally, but I'm all that's left of the
four principals in that car. I don't know why they call. I haven't
changed my story for 35 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she continues to grant interviews and share her account
of Nov. 22 with print and broadcast media, as well as with
audiences on occasional speaking engagements she makes around the
state. She doesn't know when or if Americans will have closure on
John Kennedy's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``People never get their fill of the Kennedys,'' she said.
``They were a family. He was handsome, she was beautiful and they
had adorable children. It was snuffed out pretty quickly, and we
never totally recovered. The act was horrible, as unbelievable
today as it was then, and I think we feel a little cheated. I was
part of it, and I hope it never happens again.''

A SECOND CHANCE IS REWARD ENOUGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If only the NHL could award three Masterton Trophies this
season, then maybe John Cullen, Paul Stewart and Milos Holan could
receive their due.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, none is expected to take home the league's award
given for perseverance and dedication to the game. Stewart is a
referee, and Cullen and Holan aren't playing in the league. Still,
their stories of overcoming illness to return to the ice is what
the Masterton is all about.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was diagnosed with colon cancer this summer, and yet he
is back skating in the NHL after an operation in June to remove the
cancer. Cullen and Holan each had bone marrow transplants and are
trying to recover from the shock and damage done to their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Cullen, who started the season with the Tampa Bay Lightning, is
skating with the Cleveland Lumberjacks of the International Hockey
League. Holan, who tried to come back with the Mighty Ducks of
Anaheim in training camp, is skating in Europe. Both are long shots
to play in the NHL this season, although Cullen likely will be
given every chance by the Lightning to return to the team.
</P>
<P>
   And that's all he's asking. Cullen turned down an offer to
become an assistant coach, and instead accepted his demotion to
Cleveland. Already, he has tied a Lumberjacks' mark by recording
seven points (two goals, five assists) in a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hockey Gods are on my side,'' Cullen said. ``Every bounce
was going my way.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's hoping the bounces of life continue to also fall onto
his stick.
</P>
<P>
   Stars trainer Dave Surprenant said these athletes might have a
better chance of surviving cancer than the average Joe. Being in
good physical shape is an obvious key to fighting any disease.
Being in touch with diet and exercise also seem to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``With most people, exercise is something you have to make time
for,'' Surprenant said. ``These people are paid to stay in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Having constant medical attention, as athletes do in the form of
trainers and team doctors, also is helpful in early detection,
Surprenant said. Although Stewart, 43, didn't worry about testing
until he saw ``Today'' show host Katie Couric speaking about the
cancer of her husband, Jay Monahan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was her sadness that catalyzed me into going to the
doctor,'' Stewart said. ``It was the week my son was born. My wife
and I were watching TV, and with all of the symptoms that were
being ticked off, I kept looking over at her and saying, `I have
that one. That one. That one.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Stewart said he would like to be someone who gets the
message across _ not only that cancer testing is critical, but the
disease can be beat. Cullen also has accepted the role of
spokesman, as has Holan.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as all three don't mind telling their stories,
they'd rather tell stories of hockey accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``As time goes on, the novelty will wear off, and what will be
important is that wherever I go, I will be a referee,'' Stewart
said.
SLAPSHOTS Christmas shopping Canucks general manager Bryan Burke
was in Dallas Friday night for the Stars-Islanders game and to stir
the pot, hoping a possible trade of holdout winger Pavel Bure for
unsigned Isles winger Ziggy Palffy could be in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Burke confirmed he chatted with Islanders general manager Mike
Milbury.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the deal makes no sense. The Isles won't pay Palffy $6
million a year, but would be willing to pay Bure $8 million? Burke
guaranteed on Friday the Canucks will pay no part of Bure's salary.
Cam can't Former Bruins great Cam Neely has elected to remain just
that _ a retired NHL superstar. Neely, 33, canned a comeback
attempt last week when his arthritic right hip began acting up
during workouts in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you don't have any relief at all from the pain, you have
to wonder if you can really play again,'' Neely said. ``The only
thing I was lacking out there was conditioning and a right hip.
Skillwise, I feel that I could play this game.'' Kennedy rebounds
Anyone who has followed the saga of Sheldon Kennedy has to be
cheering for the 29-year-old forward. Kennedy went public two
seasons ago that he was sexually abused by his junior-hockey coach,
Graham James, setting off a maelstrom in Canada as James was jailed
and the entire junior-hockey system was turned on its ear.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy eventually washed out of the NHL, but this past summer
completed a 136-day, 5,000-mile in-line skate across Canada,
raising $3 million to help sexually abused children. Friday,
Kennedy returned to the ice with the Manitoba Moose of the
International Hockey League and scored the game-winning goal in a
5-2 victory against the Kansas City Blades.

   THE BUZZ Eastern Conference The Sabres have some sort of hex
over the Maple Leafs, running their unbeaten streak against Toronto
to 6-0-3 with a 4-1 victory Friday night. That's not good news in
Toronto when you consider the teams will meet six times this season
after meeting only twice a year in the past. ``I don't think it's
any special success that we have against them,'' Sabres winger
Matthew Barnaby said. ``It's just the way it goes some nights.
Against the Maple Leafs, they all seem to go in.''... The Tampa Bay
Lightning has allowed five goals in a period eight times this
season, already matching a team record. Tampa has lost four
consecutive, outscored 27-5 in the process. ... Capitals left
winger Richard Zednik was suspended for four games for
high-sticking Toronto defenseman Daniil Markov. He will not be
available for the Capitals when they play Friday against the Stars
at Reunion Arena. ... Wayne Gretzky left The Forum on a fabulous
note, helping the Rangers to a 5-1 victory against the Kings in his
final appearance at the arena in which he worked his magic for
eight seasons as a member of the Los Angeles Kings. ``I found my
myself daydreaming in between shifts, thinking of all the fun times
here and how hard everyone in the organization worked to sell
hockey here,'' Gretzky said. Among the big nights there, Gretzky's
biggest was scoring his 802nd career goal in 1994 to surpass Gordie
Howe on the NHL's all-time list. ... Lightning winger Andrei
Nazarov was suspended seven games for cross-checking Cam Russell.
It is the longest suspension given by Colin Campbell, the NHL's
newest director of discipline. ... The Flyers are shopping Chris
Gratton, Dainius Zubrus and Alexandre Daigle and are said to be
interested in the Oilers' Ryan Smyth, the Flames' Theo Fleury or
the Canucks' Pavel Bure. Gratton has the most value. He's young,
and his contract for the next four years averages $1.5 million a
season.
Western Conference NHL scoring is actually up, meaning rules
changes implemented in the summer could gradually be working. In
50-game increments, this is how scoring has gone since the start of
the season: 4.7 in games 1-50; 5.0 in games 51-100; 5.3 in games
101-150 and 5.7 in games 151-200. That's a season average of 5.2
total goals per game _ lowest since 1956. Still, expect the league
to exceed last season's 5.27 goals-per-game average. ... The Kings
are 1-9-1 over their past 11 games, but expect to soon see the
return of goalies Stephane Fiset (groin), Jamie Storr (groin),
Jozef Stumpel (ankle) and Doug Bodger (hand). ... Ducks winger
Teemu Selanne has missed five games with a thigh strain and isn't
close to returning. ... Kings winger Matt Johnson has been
suspended indefinitely, and could receive at least a week off from
the grind of the game. Johnson cross-checked the Rangers' Jeff
Beukeboom in the face last week and is awaiting a conference call
tomorrow with Colin Campbell. ... Keith Tkachuk knew what was on
the line. After all, you don't hold out on the fans, demand a big
new contract and then come in and play terrible. The Phoenix
Coyotes winger said getting off to a fast start was important not
only to the team, but to himself. ``A lot of the focus was on me
and a lot of eyes were on me. To get paid the kind of money I'm
getting paid, you've got to do well,'' Tkachuk said. So far, he has
with nine goals through 13 games and a league-best plus-15 rating.
... Canucks coach Mike Keenan had to wait through two false alarms,
but he finally recorded his 500th victory last week. In fact,
Keenan thoroughly enjoyed a 5-0 whipping of Colorado that broke a
15-game Canucks winless streak (0-12-3) against the Avalanche. ...
Keenan's 500th victory tied him with former Montreal coach Toe
Blake for fifth place in NHL history. Only Scotty Bowman (1,062
wins), Al Arbour (781), Dick Irvin (693) and Billy Reay (542) are
ahead of him.

DEVILS TIE PANTHERS, 3-3  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Devils found themselves two men
short for two minutes midway through the third period, but they
escaped unscathed thanks to the heroics of Scott Stevens, Scott
Niedermayer and Ken Daneyko.
</P>
<P>
   The three defensemen were on the ice for the entire two-man
disadvantage, and along with goaltender Martin Brodeur, they
deserve a great deal of the credit for the Devils' 3-3 tie against
the Florida Panthers Saturday afternoon at Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys did a heck of a job,'' Brian Rolston said of his
three teammates. ``They were really on top of their game. And Marty
made the saves when we needed them.''
</P>
<P>
   With Stevens leading the way, the three defensemen were superb
as penalty killers. The Panthers scored only once during eight
manpower advantages.
</P>
<P>
   After killing the two-man penalty situation in the third period,
with the score tied at 3-3, the three defensemen and Brodeur were
given a standing ovation by the crowd of 16,033. The Devils got
some rest during the penalty as a result of a television timeout
and a timeout called by Coach Robbie Ftorek.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scotty anticipated well a couple of times and got the puck
down ice,'' Ftorek said about Stevens. ``Nieder forced a couple of
turnovers, and Dano did a good job cutting down the passing lane.
They did a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   Daneyko agreed with his coach's assessment of Stevens and
Niedermayer. ``The two Scotts were tremendous,'' Daneyko said.
``Both Scotts did an excellent job not getting caught out of
position. But to kill a penalty like that you have to rely on your
goalie, and Marty was there to shut them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur faced 25 shots in the game, none in overtime. His most
crucial moments came when the Devils were down two men, which
started at 8 minutes 59 seconds of the third period. Vadim
Sharifijanov and Lyle Odelein both were penalized for slashing.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur found himself on his back, on top of the puck, at one
time during the disadvantage, but he also got help from the post
once on a shot by Viktor Kozlov.
</P>
<P>
   All six goals in the game came between the fourth and the 15th
minutes of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Brylin opened the scoring for the Devils with his second
of the season, at 3:44, but the Panthers took the lead on goals by
Dave Gagner and Ray Whitney 40 seconds apart. Denis Pederson and
Petr Sykora regained the lead for the Devils at 3-2, before Rob
Niedermayer scored what turned out to be the last goal with 5:37
left in the second.

CONDITIONING ISN'T PROBLEM SAYS CARROLL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO

<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ The hot seat wasn't sizzling much under Pete
Carroll this past week.
</P>
<P>
   The sizzle instead was over the Patriots' move to Hartford in
2001, and for that, owner Bob Kraft did his embattled coach a huge
favor by directing attention away from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll, in fact, spent more time talking about a move he may
not even be part of than what the Patriots must do to change their
fortunes this season.
</P>
<P>
   He spent more time talking about the mood of a sellout crowd
Monday night at Foxboro Stadium than what the Miami Dolphins may
try to do against the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   But one issue that never seems to go away is the injury report.
And somehow Carroll takes the heat for that as well.
</P>
<P>
   He's charged with not being tough enough. Being too soft. Not
getting players back on the field. Not lighting a fire under them
to participate in the offseason conditioning program.
</P>
<P>
   Because a few regulars _ Vincent Brisby (hamstring), Willie
McGinest (groin), Zefross Moss (ankle), Todd Collins (groin), and
Mark Wheeler (knee) _ will not dress Monday night, and because
others such as Terry Glenn (hamstring), Chris Slade (ankle), Henry
Thomas (ankle), and Chad Eaton (thigh) will be playing hurt,
Carroll is still being asked why so many injuries have cropped up.
</P>
<P>
   The coach doesn't believe the difference in training and
practice styles between him and Bill Parcells is the reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the best participation in our offseason workout that we
had in the last four years,'' said Carroll. ``When a guy falls on
the back of his leg like Troy Brown did _ one of the most flexible
guys we have _ maybe his leg would have been broken if he wasn't in
such great shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the knee injury Wheeler gets is less than what it would
have been had he not been in great shape. Zefross Moss _ a guy
comes flying across the line of scrimmage and dives across his
legs. Maybe this is a case of these guys surviving these injuries,
and we have felt all along these guys would return.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn had good practice sessions Friday and Saturday and is
expected back Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Brisby, who missed a month after breaking a finger, was placed
on injured reserve with a hamstring injury suffered in the Buffalo
game last week. Anthony Ladd was activated off the practice squad.
</P>
<P>
   McGinest also will sit out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie was here (for the conditioning program) the whole
time,'' said Carroll. ``There seems to be a makeup on individual
guys that we're going to try and figure out some other solutions.
When a guy gets injured by accident, there's nothing you can do.
There's no explanation for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that we reported in great shape. Our offseason program
was strong, but maybe we need to apply special help in these unique
cases. I know our trainer, Ron O'Neil, reported that we missed the
least amount of minutes to injuries last season.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll believes in the practice method adopted by the Packers,
49ers, and Broncos of working out in pads one day a week (sometimes
two) and sees very little differences from the practice work of the
previous regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how it could be a factor,'' said Carroll. ``We're
not that far different. We have more repetitions and snaps during
the week than they did. We do all of the same things in the
offseason. We do all the same things with training in-season.
That's all the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just the timing, it just hit us.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll is seen by some as more compassionate than Parcells, who
has a reputation of getting injured players back on the field
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about compassion,'' said Carroll. ``We've got guys
with torn tissue. We can test the muscles now and see there's
bleeding in there. We have guys with six screws in their finger
trying to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like they're trying to play with bumps and bruises.
If that was the case, we'd get them out there. But these guys are
legitimately hurt. They have medical problems that can be seen with
tests, and those are things you can't rush back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to get our guys back now. We knew we would
eventually and that we'd have a team of guys back.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll has a few more hours to enjoy his time off from the hot
seat. But Monday night, before a national television audience, the
coach will be back on it.
</P>
<P>
   One closing piece of Hartford-related news: The Patriots'
season-ticket waiting list soared by more than 3,000 Saturday. The
team already had about 7,000 on the list before the announcement
that they would move in 2001. According to Patriots spokesman Don
Lowery, about 90 percent of the additions were residents of
Connecticut.

AN IMPRESSIVE CLIMB IN THE IVY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They know down, and they now know up, and there is no question
which one they prefer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were 0-7 in the Ivies last year,'' said Yale captain
Corwynne Carruthers. ``We beat 'em. It doesn't get any sweeter.
This is a program in transition, and we're back now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were picked eighth in the Ivy League and Harvard was picked
first,'' pointed out linebacker Peter Mazza. ``For us to go from
where we were at preseason, No. 8, to do what we've done is
phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yale football is back where it belongs,'' declared Carruthers,
whose team regained the all-important bragging rights in college
football's most hallowed rivalry with a 9-7 decision over a Harvard
team that will always recall this game as the coulda/shoulda/woulda
game of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things happened out there I never thought I'd see,''
sighed Crimson coach Tim Murphy, whose team's winning streak in The
Game was snapped at three.
</P>
<P>
   He was undoubtedly thinking of his veteran quarterback electing
to pitch to a trailing tailback for what turned out to be a 1-yard
loss when he could have walked into the end zone himself.
</P>
<P>
   Or the missed 19-yard field goal attempt that soon followed.
</P>
<P>
   Or his kick returner stepping out of bounds at the Harvard
8-yard line following the Yale touchdown when it looked as if the
worst that was going to happen was a runback to the 30.
</P>
<P>
   Or his quarterback fumbling the ball to Yale at the Harvard 15,
a play that set up the game-winning 27-yard field goal by Mike
Murawczyk (imagine the Scrabble triple-word possibility here) with
3:04 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Or he might have been wondering if he has ever lost a game, at
any level, to a team that could manage only eight first downs, four
of which came on its only touchdown drive.
</P>
<P>
   So if you're Harvard, you're going to say you lost. You
certainly aren't going to give Yale the satisfaction of saying it
won.
</P>
<P>
   If you're Yale, of course, you won the most important game on
your schedule, and you did so with a display of athletic nobility
that would have thrilled old Walter Camp himself. You're not going
to bother yourself worrying about your almost nonexistent offense.
You won't talk about having to punt 11 times. You will talk about
your stout defense, and rightly so.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the greatest defensive performances I've ever
seen by any team,'' gushed second-year Yale mentor Jack Siedlecki.
``Our defense, in the second half, well, I don't know if I've ever
seen a team on the field that long make so many clutch plays. They
came through today, series after series.''
</P>
<P>
   With this victory, Yale finishes 6-4 and winds up tied with
Brown for second in the Ivies at 5-2. Last year Yale was 1-9
(beating only 1-AA Valparaiso) and had that 0-7 bagel in league
play. This represents Yale's first winning season since 1991, when
it likewise went 6-4. The Bulldogs beat Princeton, as well as
Harvard, which makes them ``Big Three'' champs. In New Haven, this
is all a very big deal.
</P>
<P>
   It is a strange team. In all six victories, Yale has allowed the
other team to score first. No one has an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why we have to be behind every game,'' said
Siedlecki. ``But we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Siedlecki had a good feeling about this season since last
spring. The Yale tradition is to elect a new captain shortly after
the Harvard game. Siedlecki asked if he could deviate from
tradition and have the players elect a captain in the spring.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt we just did not have any demonstrated leadership at
that time,'' Siedlecki explained. ``I thought it would be a good
idea if we waited until spring.
</P>
<P>
   When the balloting was held, the winner was a 6-foot-2-inch,
295-pound mass of energy named Corwynne Carruthers, a middle guard
who ascended to the post with one obvious public distinction. He is
the first Canadian (Peterborough, Ontario) ever chosen as Yale
captain.
</P>
<P>
   The selection pleased the coach very much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corwynne is our hardest worker,'' explained Siedlecki. ``He
bench presses 475 pounds. For them to select him told me they were
interested in being like him. That's when I started to feel good
about the team.''
</P>
<P>
   When you have already won five games when the other guy scores
first, you are unlikely to be fazed when you are losing by a measly
7-0 entering the final period. And when you manage to score _ a
9-yard pass from Joe Walland to fullback Derek Bentley _ and then
have the extra point blocked, you say to yourself, ``It's no big
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We trail in every game,'' shrugged Capt. Carruthers. ``Even
when we had the extra point blocked, we knew we had it.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Steve Petrie's high snap caused the extra point to be
blocked, leaving Yale 7-6 in arrears, Siedlecki knew he had to do
some serious coaching. ``I walked over to Steve and Mike
(Murawczyk) and I said, `It's going to come down to you two.'''
</P>
<P>
   The wait was short. For once return man Damon Jones stepped out
of bounds on his own 8, you could feel the obvious momentum shift.
On third and 5 at the Crimson 13, quarterback Rich Linden rolled
right. Cornerback Ben Blake rocked him, freeing up the ball. Jeff
Hockenbrock flopped on it at the Harvard 15.
</P>
<P>
   Three plays produced little, and so Murawczyk, a sophomore who
had already kicked a team-record 11 field goals, was brought in to
attempt the biggest kick of his life. It was a no-doubter, right
down Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Was Siedlecki nervous as the ball was being snapped?
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' he acknowledged. ``You run all the scenarios
through your head.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't mention scenarios to Murphy. This game scenarioed him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' he said, ``is one of those days I wish I had gone for
my MBA.''

YALE HAS LATE KICK FOR VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The history of this annual gridiron ritual between Harvard and
Yale has been laced with the unusual and populated by unlikely
heroes, and sometimes the ordinary game ends up one to savor for
the team that seemed to be on the way to defeat. Saturday's
edition, in bright sunlight and swirling winds before 27,787 at
Harvard Stadium, had its unusual moments, its hero who was given a
second chance, and a grand moment for the Elis to relish.
</P>
<P>
   After Mike Murawczyk's extra point that would have tied the game
for Yale with 5:36 left was blocked by Joe Weidle, the second
chance came when Crimson quarterback Rich Linden was hit by Ben
Blake as he tried to sweep to his right and cut up field. Linden
fumbled, Jeff Hockenbrock recovered, and on the ensuing fourth
down, Murawczyk kicked a 27-yard field goal with 3:04 remaining to
lift the Elis to a 9-7 triumph.
</P>
<P>
   This was a special moment for the seniors, who had lost three
straight years to Harvard, and it completed the transition from an
0-7 Ivy team last year to a 5-2 league record this year, good for a
share of second place with Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I had a chance,'' said Murawczyk. ``Extra points
should be automatic, but we had a high snap on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Petrie's snap indeed was a little high, and Weidle rose to
the occasion and blocked it. That prompted a conference on the
sideline among Yale coach Jack Siedlecki, Murawczyk, Petrie, and
holder Ken Marshner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said, `Calm down _ there's nothing we can do about it,'''
said Murawczyk. ``The coach came up and said we were going to get
another chance. I was pretty much sure we would. We did it when it
counted, and that's all that mattered. It's not that I had an
option. I had to keep confident.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was the largest to see The Game in Harvard Stadium
since 1990, but there wasn't much to arouse the spectators in a
lackluster first half. The Elis didn't have a first down in the
first quarter (10 yards total offense), as a Crimson defense led by
tackle Chris Nowinski was on fire. The statistics at halftime
showed the visitors with just three first downs, 53 yards total
offense. The Crimson (4-6, 3-4) had eight first downs and 121
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Joe Walland, who had been Yale's offensive spark in
dramatic victories over Brown and Princeton, struggled in the early
going. But he produced when he had to, leading a 71-yard
fourth-quarter drive by completing 7 of 9 passes. He uncorked a
9-yard touchdown pass to a wide-open Derek Bentley, but Murawczyk's
kick was blocked.
</P>
<P>
   After the Crimson had forged a 7-0 lead on Linden's 1-yard
plunge at 9:24 of the third quarter, they were subsequently stopped
on three bids from less than 2 yards out. Mike Giampaolo's
chip-shot field goal attempt was wide left, but the lead stood into
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   After Linden's pass for a first down was dropped by Josh
Wilskie, another Giampaolo attempt from 33 yards was blocked by
Yale captain Corwynne Carruthers. Giampaolo had converted 6 of 7
attempts coming into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Walland went to work on the touchdown drive that lifted the
sagging hopes of the visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in pressure situations with the clock,'' said
Murawczyk. ``I knew were were going to have another chance. At
least I was hoping I would have another chance, because it wouldn't
be a way to go out.''
</P>
<P>
   Siedlecki, who replaced the legendary Carm Cozza last season,
has seen his team virtually come full circle in his second season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally beat them,'' said Carruthers. ``We got the fumble,
and we knew we'd win it. We were trying to get into a groove
passingwise, and we finally did it on that drive. We knew we had to
score, and we did. We've been down all year, trailing in every
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Elis wound up with just eight first downs and
176 yards in total offense, Walland (16 of 33 for 147 yards) and
Murawczyk came up big when it counted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just weren't executing our plays,'' said Walland. ``We
tried to run, and it wasn't working. After a while, we settled down
and we had to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind was tough. It was tough throwing the ball. On my
first play, on a wheel play, I threw it 5 yards out of bounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Walland adjusted, the defense kept coming up strong, and
Murawczyk had his second chance, the Crimson came up empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to believe in yourselves,'' said Siedlecki. ``It
took a little longer. We had to get behind again. We've been behind
in every game, but we played with tremendous emotion.''

WEST VIRGINIA ROUTS BC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORGANTOWN, W.Va. _ They were forlorn figures as they sat next
to each other at the end of Boston College's bench, draped in
hooded winter coats. Lost in their own thoughts, BC senior
quarterback Scott Mutryn said he and senior running back Mike Cloud
spoke nary a word between them as they sat and helplessly watched
the final 7:41 of their careers tick away in Saturday's 35-10 loss
to West Virginia before a crowd of 40,573 at Mountaineer Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Words really can't describe ... and words can't even begin to
explain the way we felt and what was going through our heads,''
said Mutryn, who presided over a team that began the season with so
much promise after a 3-0 start, but stumbled in a six-game losing
streak and wound up 4-7 for the second year in a row after
Saturday's season-ending conference loss. ``We've both gone through
different seasons, but he had an outstanding year and you can't say
enough about what he did. We're very proud to see where he came
from and what he'd done the previous four years to come out and
have a year like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say enough about what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloud became not only BC's but the Big East's all-time rushing
leader when he ran 28 times for 179 yards (and a 21-yard touchdown
in the second quarter) that helped him surpass Troy Stradford
(3,504, 1982-86) as the school's career leader with 3,597 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Cloud finished the season with 308 carries for 1,776 yards, both
conference records, but added another to his glittering resume when
he supplanted West Virginia's Amos Zereoue, who rushed for 143
yards on 32 carries and TDs of 47 and 30 yards, as the league's
career rushing leader _ if only for a week. Zereoue, who has 3,569
yards, has one game left Friday at Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Despite cutting remarks made earlier in the week by Zereoue, who
said in so many words that Cloud did not rank as the league's best
back, Cloud took the high road when asked about his head-to-head
duel with the junior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the Mike Cloud-Amos Zereoue game,'' Cloud insisted.
``It was Boston College against West Virginia and our defense did a
great job in holding him down. And like I said, it's not a one-man
game, it's a team game.''
</P>
<P>
   After the first quarter, it became abundantly clear that West
Virginia was a better team, but not one without flaws.
</P>
<P>
   The Mountaineers, who got 312 yards passing from junior
quarterback Marc Bulger, raced to a 12-0 first-quarter lead off a
pair of 83-yard drives that were capped by a 47-yard TD by Zereoue,
who had 12 carries for 100 yards in that quarter alone, and a
1-yard plunge by fullback Anthony Green. But West Virginia kicker
Jay Taylor failed to convert both PATs, leaving the door open for
the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   But BC stubbed its toes, too, when John Matich had a 25-yard
field goal blocked by Scooter Davis, a costly mistake that led to a
13-play, 83-yard drive capped by Green's TD.
</P>
<P>
   After Cloud broke the school's career rushing record with his
21-yard TD, Zereoue answered by capping a five-play, 71-yard drive
with a 30-yard run. Taylor finally found the mark on the PAT to
give West Virginia a 19-7 lead with 2:15 left before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   That's when it really got ugly.
</P>
<P>
   On BC's next possession, Perlo Bastien blocked a Jason Malecki
punt. The ball rolled towards the BC goal line with several
Mountaineers in hot pursuit, but Carlos Moore alertly kicked it
through the end zone. Moore was charged with an illegal kick
penalty, resulting in a safety that gave West Virginia a 21-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   On West Virginia's next possession, Taylor was charged with the
same penalty when he dropped a punt snap and tried to kick the ball
illegally. BC took over at the West Virginia 11, but came away
empty when Matich missed a 28-yard field goal attempt to the right.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the times that's a function of a better football
team, with better people making plays against you,'' said BC coach
Tom O'Brien. ``That's the first time this year we've had a (field
goal) kick blocked and the end of the half was about as ugly of an
end of a half as you'd want to see. And they got us on a couple of
blitzes there ... and then we get down there on the 5 or 6-yard
line and get a late-hit penalty; just a lot of stupid things.''
</P>
<P>
   Matich finally connected on a 22-yard field goal, capping a
nine-play, 58-yard march, but Bulger, who spread the ball to seven
receivers, fired a 31-yard TD pass to Antonio Brown just before he
was blasted by the blitzing Pedro Cirino. Bulger then put the game
out of reach, 35-10, in the fourth when he lofted a 10-yard pass in
the corner of the end zone to Shawn Foreman.
</P>
<P>
   After turning it over on their next series, Mutryn and Cloud
were relegated to the sideline, where they sat and watched in
silence as their careers came to a close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a moment that we both wanted to ourselves and
there was no way to describe how we were feeling,'' Cloud said.
``It was just mixed emotions. I think it was just a moment where we
sat and reflected on things.''
</P>
<P>
   But both seemed to share the same fervent wish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish,'' Cloud said, ``I had at least one more year
left.''

FOR NEELY, NO COMEBACK, NO REGRETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The official end to the Cam Neely comeback came a little less
than a week ago when Neely announced that the pain in his hip
wouldn't allow him to continue to progress toward a return in the
National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   For that week, though, it allowed everyone a chance to fantasize
that the former 50-goal scorer might suit up in his familiar No. 8
again and fire blistering slap shots off the right wing.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Tallas had known Neely only peripherally; the goalie played
one game for Boston in Neely's final season, a couple of weeks
after Neely had played in his last game in Anaheim. In the last
week, Tallas learned what every goalie in the NHL had learned
throughout Neely's 13-year career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me those shots hurt,'' said Tallas's agent, Jay Fee,
who also represents Neely. ``He said he still had an awful lot on
his shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurricanes forward Gary Roberts could sympathize with Neely. It
appeared his career was over when he suffered a severe neck injury
that forced him to sit out the 1995-96 season. But Roberts returned
last year to score 20 goals and 49 points in 61 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping he would make it because I went through the same
thing,'' said Roberts, who scored a career-high 53 goals with
Calgary in 1991-92, the same year Neely was limited to just nine
games after colliding with Ulf Samuelsson in the 1991 playoffs.
``He's still a young guy and I'm sure that he thought that if he
didn't give it a shot, he might regret it down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Neely said he has no regrets. He played 13 seasons, which is
longer than many play. His commitment and work ethic should serve
as an inspiration to the young players in the league now.
</P>
<P>
   What his future holds is anyone's guess. However, one of his
most enduring qualities has been his willingness to say what he
thinks, and you could do far worse than hiring Neely as a broadcast
analyst. During a cameo stint on Channel 38 a couple of seasons
ago, Neely didn't mince words when talking about the game he was
watching.
</P>
<P>
   What was most sad about Neely's original retirement was the
regret he carried to the lecturn in the Legends restaurant at the
FleetCenter. That has certainly changed. The other day, Neely
talked like a man with more in his life than hockey. He has a
terrific wife and a new baby boy. And he has something he really
needed: closure.

   Good guy  &UR; Colin Campbell &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who is now wearing the black hat as
the league's chief disciplinarian, said he doesn't mind anyone
questioning his decision-making. What drives him nuts is people
complimenting him at the expense of his predecessor,  &UR; Brian
Burke &LR; , &UR;  &LR; now in the GM seat in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing worse for a coach than to have a new coach
come in and criticize what the other coach did, saying, `I'm going
to do it differently,''' said Campbell, drawing an analogy to his
former line of work. ``It's not that easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell thinks Burke did a terrific job in his five years
running the league's supplementary discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (commissioner  &UR; Gary Bettman &LR; ) &UR;  &LR; came in and changed the
whole system around, Brian was the hockey man,'' said Campbell.
``He had a different way and different background than I did and he
did a great job. I had the opportunity to see him work first-hand
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comparisons are certainly unfair. The pressure lasts 12 months
a year, 24 hours a day, it's a constant. For five years, Brian did
an excellent job. Some people would say he didn't play the game at
the NHL level, but he had a feel for every aspect. He played
college, he played in the AHL, he was an agent, an assistant GM,
and a GM.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot from Brian and he helped me more than anyone
in the transition.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as Campbell is enjoying his new role, he said it's
impossible to win. In his opinion, most of the criticism of Burke
comes from people with an ax to grind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years in that job, you're not going to make a lot of
friends, you're going to make a lot more enemies,'' he said. ``It's
like being a traffic cop. It's either no ticket or write a ticket,
they're not going to say thanks for no ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``When discussing a suspension with Mr. Bettman, he said, `No
one is going to be happy about a suspension, no one is going to
thank you.' He's right.''

   Hard to figure the decision-making in Tampa. Belmont native
 &UR; Paul Mara &LR; , &UR;  &LR; taken with the No. 7 overall pick in 1997, was the
last defenseman cut from the club, and he's back with his junior
team in Plymouth of the Ontario League (5 goals and 11 assists in
13 games). He had an impressive training camp and ran the
Lightning's power play during the exhibition season but wasn't good
enough to stay? Hmmmm. Consider that blue liners  &UR; David Wilkie  &LR; and
 &UR; Michal Sykora  &LR; were sent down to Cleveland. Wilkie cleared waivers
and reported. Sykora has balked, saying he might go home to the
Czech Republic. Meanwhile, the Lightning gave up an Eastern
Conference-worst 66 goals in 18 games, an average of 3.66 ...
Another local product, former Boston University standout  &UR; Jeff
Kealty &LR; , &UR;  &LR; has found a home in Milwaukee. He was released from
Colorado's camp, hooked on with Nashville as a tryout, then did
well enough to be assigned to Milwaukee's IHL club. In 13 games, he
has 2 goals and 8 points and is among the top four in ice time ...
Vancouver coach  &UR; Mike Keenan  &LR; earned the 500th win of his career in
Thursday's 5-0 victory over the Avalanche. It was the first time in
16 tries that the Canucks had beaten Colorado ... Don't blame
 &UR; Roman Vopat  &LR; if he's afraid to put away his suitcase. The center
has already been traded three times this season, and it's only
November. He began with Los Angeles, was dealt to the Avalanche
Oct. 29, then shipped to Chicago Nov. 10. Last Tuesday, he was
moved to Philadelphia for  &UR; Mike Maneluk  &LR; ... Nice to see  &UR; Milos
Holan  &LR; back playing hockey. The former Flyers and Mighty Ducks
defenseman is skating for HC Vitkovice of the Czech Republic. Just
over a week ago, he played his first game since 1996. Holan has
been battling leukemia for two years, undergoing chemotherapy and a
bone marrow transplant. He was cut by the Ducks after preseason
camp. ``I'm the happiest man on earth now,'' said Holan, 27. ``I
have the same feelings as when I first played in the NHL.''

   You think things are bad here? Go to Montreal and see how last
week's blockbuster trade is being viewed north of the border. In a
word, the feedback has been brutal. According to a TV poll, 90
percent of viewers opposed the deal that brought goalie  &UR; Jeff
Hackett &LR;  and defensemen  &UR; Eric Weinrich  &LR; and  &UR; Alain Nasreddine  &LR; from
Chicago for goalie  &UR; Jocelyn Thibault  &LR; and defensemen  &UR; Dave Manson
 &LR; and  &UR; Brad Brown &LR; . One Montreal columnist referred to Hackett as
``sieve of the month.'' ...  &UR; Phil Esposito &LR; , &UR;  &LR; former Lightning
general manager, is working as a studio analyst for Fox Sports
News. Esposito, who was fired by new ownership two games into the
season, will commute from Tampa to Los Angeles. ``I like the Tampa
area too much to leave it, at this time anyway, I love it,''
Esposito said. ``It will be tough on my family but it's something I
want to give a shot.'' Esposito worked in TV as a color analyst for
the Rangers before becoming that club's GM in 1986 ... It's never,
ever boring in Montreal, at least when it comes to hockey. There
was a report out of that city that coach  &UR; Alain Vigneault  &LR; and
forward  &UR; Mark Recchi  &LR; were jawing at each other during Tuesday's
5-4 loss to Carolina. Recchi wasn't out for the power play, which
was thought to be the reason for the exchange. However, Recchi said
it was a misunderstanding. ``If you really want to know why I was
in an ugly mood,'' said Recchi, ``it's because with this (flu)
thing, I'm not helping the team. Not one bit. Another reason was
that I had just been hit from behind pretty hard _ a pretty cheap
hit. But believe me, I didn't have a conversation with Vigneault.
No way.'' Recchi actually has pneumonia ... Oft-injured Ottawa star
 &UR; Daniel Alfredsson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who has been out of the lineup more than a
week because of an eye injury suffered against Edmonton, is back
riding the bike and hopes to be in the lineup Monday night against
the Canucks. Alfredsson was bored out of his mind waiting for his
injury to heal. Some days, he said, he was sleeping for as many as
15 hours a day. ``I've never slept that long in my life,'' he said.
``It's no fun sitting around. I didn't feel like a hockey player. I
haven't even been able to work out. I've just been watching TV and
sleeping.'' ... This afternoon, the Bruins' alumni team will face
the Canton Youth Hockey Coaches at the Metropolis Rink in Canton
(Route 138 South off Route 128) at 4 p.m., with proceeds going to
the Canton High School girls' ice hockey program.

VAUGHN AND LA: MIXED SIGNALS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Will the Los Angeles Dodgers step up to the plate with an offer
for Mo Vaughn? Maybe, but landing the free agent first baseman
isn't general manager Kevin Malone's top priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had heard they were going to make me an offer Friday, but I
haven't heard from my agents yet,'' Vaughn said Saturday. ``I know
they've been interested from the beginning, but they've been trying
to do some things with their roster.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Dodgers are concentrating on Randy Johnson, who
visited Dodger Stadium Saturday and anticipates an offer. Any
notion that a Los Angeles pitch to Vaughn is imminent is incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had discussions with his agents, but we've not indicated
we will make an offer,'' Malone told the Los Angeles Times. ``We're
not even close to making an offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if an offer to Vaughn may be made, Malone said, ``I guess
that's a possibility down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim Angels have offered Vaughn six years and $79
million, and Vaughn thought the Arizona Diamondbacks might get into
the mix if they're out of the running for center fielder Bernie
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really didn't matter whether it was one team or 20 teams
after me,'' said Vaughn. ``I just wanted a situation where the team
that was after me made it very clear they wanted me. The Angels
have done that. They've been great throughout the whole process.
They haven't put any time limits on any of this and they stepped to
the plate big-time.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said he hasn't spoken to anyone from the Red Sox since
they made their final offer to him in Naples, Fla., a week and a
half ago.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said he wasn't disappointed that no Eastern team had made
an offer to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate the ones that I do have,'' he said. ``This thing
has taken on the course I thought it would after the Red Sox
situation ended. We're not looking to accelerate this or try to
twist anyone's arm. We're being patient. I'm just sitting here at
home waiting. I'm working out and getting ready for the next
season.''

IN BUSINESS, THERE IS PROFIT AND LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; What Thomas Finneran and many in the Commonwealth learned last
week is that a businessman is a businessman, even if he sometimes
sounds like a televangelist when talking about the city where he
grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Kraft is a guy who once (a week) said he grows misty-eyed at
the thought of his beloved Boston Braves leaving him behind for
Milwaukee in 1953. Judging by what he did last week, he's gotten
over it.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft is a Boston guy, but he's not a goofy guy. He's a Boston
guy, but not a blind guy. He's a Boston guy, but not an idiot. And
so, faced with the choice of raising $200 million of his own
capital to build a stadium in Foxborough that would not have been
what he wanted, or being handed $350 million in Connecticut to have
the state build one to his specifications, he took the money and
ran. If he could get some of his highest-priced players to do as
well, they wouldn't be 5-5 at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   This does not qualify as shocking. It is what good businessmen
do, and Kraft is nothing if not a good businessman, as he has
proven both before he bought the Patriots in 1994 and since. It is
not about emotions and never was, despite all the talk about misty
eyes and departed franchises and ``public trusts'' since the day he
``saved the team'' for his ``hometown.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, if this is the end, Kraft saved the team but not for
his hometown, unless there's going to be a change in his biography
along with the change in stadium address.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Billy Sullivan went broke ``saving the team'' for
his hometown. He didn't sell when it would have been wise to sell,
and he didn't move when it would have been wise to move it, and he
ended up in Foxborough only because he'd been thrown out of every
stadium in Boston. Billy Sullivan saved the team. Bob Kraft moved
it to Hartford, and Hartford isn't Hingham.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's decision was a good business move for the Kraft
family, one Bob had been counseled to make by his family and his
financial advisers while he continued to search for a way to keep
the team in Massachusetts. It made sense both for the future
viability of the Patriots in a sport in which owners are hell-bent
on wasting their money every offseason, and because the
Commonwealth of Finneran clearly was not going to fork over the
kind of infrastructure assistance Kraft needed to build a
state-of-the-art stadium that would be easy to get into and out of
for his high-end customers.
</P>
<P>
   So Kraft ended up with a $550 million windfall on the deal (the
$200 million he doesn't have to raise, plus the $350 million
stadium he's getting) for driving down the Mass Pike and I-84 a
couple of hours. That's on top of the sudden jump in the value of
his franchise for making that kind of move.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft is said to have overpaid when he laid out $178 million for
the Patriots, $25 million for the stadium, and picked up enough
past debt to put his cost at $206 million. While he may well have
overpaid at the time, he now holds a franchise that will be worth
something in the same $500 million range as the new Cleveland
franchise once Kraft gets settled into his risk-free stadium in
Connecticut. Add to that the constant revenue stream from TV and
the bonanza expansion-franchise fees he's getting from Cleveland
and whoever wins the Los Angeles-Houston sweepstakes (bet on LA, by
the way), and Kraft has done the kind of deal that makes him what
he is today: a rich guy with a football team that should be called
the Hartford Actuarial Tables, not the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many in the sports business, when Kraft pulled the gun
out of his pocket, it was not to lay it on the table for effect. It
was to fire it, which he did when he signed the agreement with the
state of Connecticut that will lead the Patriots to Hartford in
2001 if the Nutmeg State can raise the cabbage.
</P>
<P>
   Before it's over, it is a move that will mean bad karma for
Kraft. In Hinduism, karma is the total effect of one's actions
during the successive phases of one's life that determines one's
destiny. Looked at that way, Kraft has gone from the kid crying
over the loss of the Braves from his hometown to the man who leaves
kids crying for the loss of the Patriots from their hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody will have to pay for that one day, because they always
do. Not financially, for sure, because Kraft is covered on that,
but the fact is he was always covered on that. He was always going
to be a rich guy with rich kids in a big house regardless of
whether the Patriots played in Foxborough or not. Now he's a richer
guy with richer kids in a bigger house in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   But Kraft didn't look that happy when the deal was being signed,
and maybe that's because he's more his father's son than he is like
the people who advised him to move. Maybe he understands what this
will really mean for him ... that one day an older Bob Kraft will
be walking up State Street or down Federal Street, his shoulders
hunched to the wind, and he'll pass a couple of young guys on the
rise in rep ties and well-pressed suits who will mumble, ``That's
the guy who moved the Patriots.''
</P>
<P>
   That's his legacy now.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   After a dismal 1-3 start, the Oilers made a subtle offensive
change that coach  &UR; Jeff Fisher  &LR; contends has been an integral part
of a resurgence that has them at 6-4. Tennessee has won five of its
last six and achieved one of Fisher's principal preseason goals. He
wanted desperately to improve on last year's 2-6 division rec-ord.
His team is 5-1 in the AFC Central, and a big reason for the
turnaround was a decision to go almost exclusively to a one-back,
two-tight-end set six weeks ago. ``After three or four weeks, we
moved to more of a one-back set with two tight ends and detached
one of the tight ends to utilize more movement,'' Fisher said.
``That has helped us recognize things up front. It's also helped us
to a certain extent to stay out of those eight-man-front defenses
at times. We're a zone-oriented offense run scheme. When you're
utilizing a zone scheme, you've got to be able to spread people out
to allow your back to cut back. By opening up the formation a
little bit with our tight ends, that's helped us the last six
weeks.'' ... Kraft's decision to push the commissioner's office to
``investigate'' tampering charges against  &UR; Bill Parcells  &LR; for his
phone call to  &UR; Drew Bledsoe  &LR; is another example of pettiness and
cloudy thinking. Kraft really couldn't care less about the Bledsoe
call, but he believes Parcells has tried to tamper with several of
his soon-to-become free agents through subtle conversations, and he
hopes this will be a warning to the Jets. But all he really
accomplished was to make Parcells seem even bigger in the Patriots'
locker room, a place in which his image has already swollen to
unmanageable proportions. It is time to let sleeping dogs lie. It
is time even to let a wide-awake dog lie. The success of the
Patriots is no longer determined by Parcells, but the team's
obsession with him may contribute to its failures if it continues
... Baltimore's  &UR; Ray Lewis &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who led the NFL in tackles last
season with 210, became the highest-paid linebacker in football
Thursday at the age of 23. With another year to go on his present
contract but the right to terminate the deal he signed in 1996
because he reached various incentives, Lewis agreed to a four-year,
$26 million extension that includes a $7 million signing bonus.
That pushes him past  &UR; Junior Seau &LR; , &UR; Levon Kirkland &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Ted
Johnson &LR; . Here is what the Patriots are getting from Johnson for $5
million a year and what Lewis has done for the Ravens. After 38
games, Lewis is averaging 11.3 tackles a game. Johnson, in 42 games
(he came into the NFL a year before Lewis), is averaging 8.6 a
game. A year ago, Johnson was credited with 127 tackles to Lewis's
league-leading 210.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   The NFL is nothing if not sales-oriented. The Oilers will still
have a derrick on their helmets Sunday, but by mid-December the
league will have its new ``Titans'' logo on merchandise, in time
for the holidays. The game may not be as good as it was 20 years
ago, but the T-shirt sales are higher ... Foxborough resident  &UR; Joe
Tolland  &LR; continued his statistical breakdown of the Patriots'
drives and found some surprising good news when he analyzed the
team's opening drives of the second half. On those 10 series, the
Patriots have produced 30 points (to zero in the first half), with
16 first downs, going three-and-out only four times. Meanwhile,
they have held opponents to zero points, with 12 first downs, and
forced them to go three-and-out four times in early second-half
efforts. Not surprisingly, Bledsoe's performance reflects the
disparity. On the game-opening drives, he is 9 for 26 passing; on
the second-half opening drives, he is 23 for 38. This led Tolland
to come up with perhaps the best idea of the season: ``They should
scrap the idea of scripting the opening plays of the game and meet
20 minutes prior to the game in the locker room and develop the
first series in the same way it's done at halftime,'' he joked ...
It may be difficult for the Patriots to anticipate what the
Dolphins' pass defense will have in mind Monday night. In the first
two games of the season, a fourth of Miami's 12 sacks came from
defensive backs and linebackers, but the Dolphins have produced
only 16 sacks over the next eight games, with only three coming
from their secondary or linebacking corps. Although that indicates
the Dolphins' blitzing has slowed some, it does not mean they
aren't putting heat on the quarterback. Opponents have completed
only 51.3 percent of their throws against the swift-moving defense
_ Bledsoe went a miserable 13 of 33 in Miami's victory last month _
and the Dolphins have held opposing quarterbacks to a rating of
59.1, one of the lowest in the NFL. Only two Miami opponents have
converted more than 40 percent of their chances on third down; the
Patriots were at 27 percent in the first meeting, well below their
already dismal 39.2 conversion rate ... Miami's offense has not
been anywhere near as productive as it was when  &UR; Dan Ma &LR; - &UR; rino  &LR; was
still alive, but coordinator  &UR; Kippy Brown  &LR; has the Dolphins doing
fewer things with less mistakes, and it has led to a 7-3 record. If
it works again Monday night, the Patriots will be virtually out of
the playoff picture with more than a month to go and the Dolphins
will have a stranglehold on the division. Brown uses only 35-40
plays a game. Under previous coordinator  &UR; Gary Stevens &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the
Dolphins sometimes would come into games with more than 100 plays
on their list, which was an impossible undertaking if execution is
your aim.

   Denver's  &UR; Terrell Davis  &LR; is having what could be the greatest
season ever by a running back. He has 1,330 yards and 17
touchdowns, which is on pace to break both  &UR; Eric Dickerson's
 &LR; record of 2,105 yards and  &UR; Emmitt Smith's  &LR; record of 25 touchdowns
... Raiders coach  &UR; Jon Gruden  &LR; continued to work rookie cornerback
 &UR; Charles Woodson  &LR; as a wide receiver during practice and is
threatening to use him there to add punch to the passing game.
Gruden mentioned the idea a week ago before the Seattle game but
did not act on it. Woodson, the former Heisman Trophy winner,
caught 11 passes at Michigan last season and averaged 21 yards a
catch. The Raiders have only nine touchdown passes this season, in
part because of the injury to quarterback  &UR; Jeff George  &LR; ... One
reason for the Raiders' remarkable turnaround from last year's 4-12
debacle is that they are now on the right side of thin margins of
victory. Oakland is 5-1 this year in games decided by 3 points or
fewer. The previous two seasons, with  &UR; Joe Bugel  &LR; as head coach,
they went 1-9 in such games ... Word among college scouts is that
the Dolphins have spent an inordinate amount of time looking at
Central Florida quarterback  &UR; Dante Culpepper &LR; . With Marino 37 and
the Dolphin offense limping along, Culpepper could make for an
interesting shift, because he is considered a giant-sized Houdini.
He is bigger than  &UR; Steve McNair  &LR; and some say more elusive, which
is saying something since McNair ran 71 yards for a touchdown last
Sunday after avoiding a blitz. At 6 feet 4 inches, 240 pounds, and
with a strong arm and fast feet, Culpepper may be gone by the time
Miami drafts ...  &UR; Steve Lofton  &LR; may not have been good enough to
find work as a cornerback in New England, but he's starting Sunday
for the Panthers in place of injured  &UR; Doug Evans &LR; . This season has
been a nightmare for Evans, who just came back from one injury only
to separate his right shoulder and be lost for a month. After
signing a five-year, $22.5 million free agent contract in the
offseason with a $7.5 million signing bonus, Evans has been like
the rest of the Panthers: a disappointment.

   &UR; Dana Stubblefield &LR; , &UR; Dan Wilkinson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Sean Gilbert  &LR; have
been cited as the biggest failures of last season's free agent
class, but what of the 49ers' signings of defensive end  &UR; Gabe
Wilkins  &LR; and cornerback  &UR; Antonio Langham &LR; ? Neither starts any
longer, despite Wilkins's five-year, $20 million contract and
Langham's $16.9 million deal. On a team whose defense has slipped
from first a year ago to 17th, those signings have been killers.
San Francisco has fallen behind by at least 16 points in each of
the past three games and four times in the past five weeks. The
49ers went 2-2 in those games, coming back to beat Indianapolis and
Carolina but losing to Green Bay and Atlanta ... Not every free
agent is a bust. When the Oilers made  &UR; Craig Hentrich  &LR; the first
million-dollar punter, some thought they were crazy, but Hentrich
leads the NFL with a 47.5-yard gross and 40-yard net and has also
made a significant difference on kickoffs. A year ago, Tennessee
had only four touchbacks. This season, Hentrich has launched 21
touchbacks on 46 kickoffs ... No wonder Lions coach  &UR; Bobby Ross
 &LR; lost his mind recently. His team is 2-7, losing the games nearly
everyone in the NFL wins.  &UR; Barry Sanders  &LR; has rushed for more than
100 yards six times this season. The Lions have lost four of those
games. The other 29 NFL teams win 81 percent of the time when a
running back rushes for 100 yards ... It may be too late to salvage
the Buccaneers' season, but defensive lineman  &UR; Warren Sapp
 &LR; admitted he's been part of the problem after coach  &UR; Tony Dungy
 &LR; showed Sapp film of him running down several quarterbacks from
behind last season, when he weighed 276 pounds. Sapp says he
started the year at 315 pounds after a bit too much celebrating of
his six-year, $36 million contract. He's now down to 295 and
playing better ...  &UR; Rod Woodson  &LR; seems to have found new life in
Baltimore after appearing to be finished last season in San
Francisco. Woodson has adjusted his stance at the line of
scrimmage, now facing receivers head-on instead of playing with his
body turned, as the 49ers favored. He has five interceptions, which
ties him for second in the NFL. More significant, a year ago he had
a dozen interference calls. This year he has none.

KRAFT HITS LOTTERY IN CONNECTICUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL McDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   About a dozen years ago, when late Patriots owner Billy Sullivan
was conducting one of his many fire sales, I asked one of the
rejected suitors, ``What happened? You told me the deal was done.''
</P>
<P>
   His response: ``We thought Sullivan wanted a deal. Then we
learned what he wanted was a Pig Package.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A `Pig Package'? What's that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our group gave it that name when he became so greedy that we
just had to walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, I received a call from that same suitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just read your story this morning about the Kraft deal in
Hartford,'' he said. ``If that goes down, that will be the all-time
Pig Package.''
</P>
<P>
   A story in Saturday's Globe detailed the financial breakdown of
the memorandum of understanding between Patriots owner Bob Kraft
and the state of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The details were read to three NFL owners, who requested
anonymity. All agreed that it is the greatest financial deal any
National Football League owner has ever received.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this thing goes through,'' said one owner, ``he will make
more money than any other team in the league. This is a lot like
the Cleveland deal and the Baltimore deal. But this is better. He
will net about $50 million a year out of this thing. Good luck to
him. It will help the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft, in his own stadium in Foxborough, took in roughly $40
million-45 million a year. This is money generated through tickets,
concessions, parking, signage, novelties, etc.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers in the Connecticut arrangement indicate that Kraft's
intake will double, to $90 million-$100 million per year. Ten
percent will go to the state of Connecticut. The rest is his.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, there are some generous perks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; The state will give Kraft $15 million to build a training
facility in the area.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; The state will give Kraft the land to build an NFL Pavilion,
i.e. theme park.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; The state will give Kraft the rights to the primary hotel
that will be attached to the new convention center, which will be
built as part of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft can sell these rights to a major hotel chain, such as
Hyatt or Hilton, and make millions more without spending a cent.
</P>
<P>
   The state will also put aside a total of $190 million over the
next 30 years for so-called capital improvements to the new
stadium. But as one NFL owner suggested Saturday, ``That's money in
theory that is being set aside for another new stadium in 30
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft paid $160 million in January 1994 to purchase the
Patriots. He purchased Foxboro Stadium out of a bankruptcy court
for roughly $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   In pro football, under the current collective bargaining
agreement, 64 percent of revenues go to the players in salary.
However, that does not include luxury box revenue ($12.5 million a
year in Hartford) and, according to one owner, stadium signage,
which in Hartford he estimated would yield $10 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kraft can put that money, about $20 million a year, in his
pocket and not share it with anyone (except the state of
Connecticut),'' the owner said.
</P>
<P>
   That number does not include parking revenue because the
memorandum did not delineate how much money will be generated from
that. But Kraft will receive 90 percent of that, whatever it is.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft has said he has to move out of Foxborough because he is
not making money, and his family would have to sell the team ``out
of the region.'' So, by moving it to Connecticut, he is saving it
for New England.
</P>
<P>
   He said the other day that he has the lowest revenues in the
league. This brought a chuckle from a couple of his peers. One said
Kraft's revenue ranked ninth or 10th (out of 30 teams). Another
said it was 12th. A third said, ``They used to be somewhere between
five and 10, but they dropped back with the new stadiums in Tampa,
Cleveland, and Baltimore.''
</P>
<P>
   The most outstanding part of Kraft's incredible Connecticut deal
is the state guaranteeing money toward the sale of luxury boxes and
preferred seats.
</P>
<P>
   In Baltimore, St. Louis, and Washington, three new stadiums,
there are no government guarantees on the sale of these boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut will spend up to $10 million per year to cover club
seats not sold over 4,000. In other words, if Kraft can't sell
2,000 of the 6,000 club seats, the state will pay him for the empty
seats.
</P>
<P>
   The state will have $7.5 million a year to give Kraft for empty
luxury boxes, after the first 50 are sold. If Kraft sells 50, and
the rest do not sell, the state has to pay him $7.5 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Connecticut has yet to approve the package, but it
is supposed to be a slam dunk. The governor has lined up some
legislative heavy hitters to push for passage.
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, I remember talking to John Shaw, the president
of the Los Angeles Rams (soon to be the St. Louis Rams). We talked
about his negotiations with the politicians on a lease in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have gotten more,'' he said, ``but I didn't push for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked him why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because if the deal is that good, if they give you everything
you want, then the politicians will probably vote it down,'' he
said.
</P>

<P>
   Ever walked into a room that just felt really good? You couldn't
explain why, but everything felt right. The energy just worked.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are _ even if the person who arranged the room didn't do
it on purpose _ the place had good feng shui.
</P>
<P>
   Feng shui is the ancient Chinese art of arranging a balanced
environment to create a positive flow of energy. Popular for years
among decorators, it's now moving into the office, according to a
new book, ``Feng Shui at Work,'' by Kirsten Lagatree, who says it
can have dramatic results in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Put your furniture in the proper place, hang the right things in
the right places on your walls, and seat your employees
strategically _ then watch as the office becomes a more comfortable
place to work, relationships among co-workers improve, and your
business grows.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with your desk. It must face the door. Like much
with feng shui, this is rooted in common sense. If your back is to
the door, you'll be caught off guard when people walk in, says
Lagatree, and you won't be able to keep an eye on things. Sit
catercorner from the door with two walls intersecting behind your
desk to stay in visual and physical command of the space.
</P>
<P>
   Having either side of your desk up against a wall blocks energy,
says Steven Post, CEO of the San Francisco-based Geomancy/Feng Shui
Education Organization. The path of movement around your entire
office should be smooth and unencumbered, says Post. Doors should
almost never be blocked.
</P>
<P>
   Clutter stops the flow of energy. ``Clutter is a series of
postponed decisions,'' says Lagatree. ``You are surrounded by
things that are calling for your attention, so you're never really
concentrating on the thing in front of you at that moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Strive for Zen surfaces in your office, says Hope Karan Gerecht,
a feng shui consultant in Baltimore. That means at least half the
vertical and horizontal surfaces should be clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mind needs a place to rest and relax as it is
problem-solving and creating,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Think carefully about the objects you surround yourself with,
says Gerecht: ``Everything around us is creating our lives on a
daily basis.'' Is an item something that pleases you? Or something
you're using because you have it?
</P>
<P>
   Also, don't keep anything broken in your office; it saps energy.
The office should have a feeling of life energy, whether you create
it with plants, fish, or color.
</P>
<P>
   Pick a desk your own size. A big desk may look impressive, but
if it dwarfs you, you'll feel lost, and you may have trouble
expanding your business.
</P>
<P>
   Mirrors are the aspirin of feng shui. Hang mirrors to reflect
anything you want doubled, like a view of water. Don't, however,
let them reflect the top of your desk, unless what you're looking
for is a doubling of your workload.
</P>
<P>
   And never situate an employee beneath or directly facing an exit
sign. ``It gives the subconscious command for them to exit,''
explains Gerecht. ``Even if they stay, a part of their psyche may
feel uncommitted.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever walked into a room that just felt really good? You couldn't
explain why, but everything felt right. The energy just worked.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are _ even if the person who arranged the room didn't do
it on purpose _ the place had good feng shui.
</P>
<P>
   Feng shui is the ancient Chinese art of arranging a balanced
environment to create a positive flow of energy. Popular for years
among decorators, it's now moving into the office, according to a
new book, ``Feng Shui at Work,'' by Kirsten Lagatree, who says it
can have dramatic results in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Put your furniture in the proper place, hang the right things in
the right places on your walls, and seat your employees
strategically _ then watch as the office becomes a more comfortable
place to work, relationships among co-workers improve, and your
business grows.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with your desk. It must face the door. Like much
with feng shui, this is rooted in common sense. If your back is to
the door, you'll be caught off guard when people walk in, says
Lagatree, and you won't be able to keep an eye on things. Sit
catercorner from the door with two walls intersecting behind your
desk to stay in visual and physical command of the space.
</P>
<P>
   Having either side of your desk up against a wall blocks energy,
says Steven Post, CEO of the San Francisco-based Geomancy/Feng Shui
Education Organization. The path of movement around your entire
office should be smooth and unencumbered, says Post. Doors should
almost never be blocked.
</P>
<P>
   Clutter stops the flow of energy. ``Clutter is a series of
postponed decisions,'' says Lagatree. ``You are surrounded by
things that are calling for your attention, so you're never really
concentrating on the thing in front of you at that moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Strive for Zen surfaces in your office, says Hope Karan Gerecht,
a feng shui consultant in Baltimore. That means at least half the
vertical and horizontal surfaces should be clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mind needs a place to rest and relax as it is
problem-solving and creating,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Think carefully about the objects you surround yourself with,
says Gerecht: ``Everything around us is creating our lives on a
daily basis.'' Is an item something that pleases you? Or something
you're using because you have it?
</P>
<P>
   Also, don't keep anything broken in your office; it saps energy.
The office should have a feeling of life energy, whether you create
it with plants, fish, or color.
</P>
<P>
   Pick a desk your own size. A big desk may look impressive, but
if it dwarfs you, you'll feel lost, and you may have trouble
expanding your business.
</P>
<P>
   Mirrors are the aspirin of feng shui. Hang mirrors to reflect
anything you want doubled, like a view of water. Don't, however,
let them reflect the top of your desk, unless what you're looking
for is a doubling of your workload.
</P>
<P>
   And never situate an employee beneath or directly facing an exit
sign. ``It gives the subconscious command for them to exit,''
explains Gerecht. ``Even if they stay, a part of their psyche may
feel uncommitted.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund is out of dough. Politicians
from Tokyo to Moscow lack the mandate or the will to fix their
economies. Intervention has failed the central banks and
speculators.
</P>
<P>
   All that now seems to stand between the world and a slide into
global recession are U.S. consumers, armed with wallets full of
credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Don't laugh at this unlikely superhero _ these notoriously
casual savers who already strain under a mountain of debt are
stronger than they look. But don't overestimate what they'll be
able to pull off, either.
</P>
<P>
   At best, U.S. consumers can buy the global economy some time and
prevent a worldwide panic. But they won't be able to stop the Asian
flu from infecting Latin America, and they can't, by themselves,
turn the situation around.
</P>
<P>
   How did the global economy get to this pass? More than a year
after the collapse of the Thai baht triggered an avalanche that
buried all of Asia, the International Monetary Fund's program of
huge loans, higher rates, and big cuts to government spending
hasn't stabilized the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   That medicine did indeed stop the feverish descent of Asia's
currencies (particularly the South Korean won, which is worth more
today than it was in January), but overall, the economies of the
region have become sicker, not healthier.
</P>
<P>
   High interest rates, for example, have helped choke off growth.
Indonesia's gross domestic product will fall an estimated 15
percent this year. (For context, Mexico's GDP sank 7 percent in
1995 after the peso crisis.)
</P>
<P>
   And Japan is, even its traditionally optimistic bureaucrats
admit, officially in recession.
</P>
<P>
   Now the IMF is almost out of money. The bankers are so close to
the bottom of the vault that in mid-August they elected not to
throw more cash into Russia. A bailout, the IMF felt, would have
depleted reserves without offering the slightest chance that
Russia's problems would be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Troubled Latin American countries such as Venezuela and Brazil
aren't likely to get a warmer welcome.
</P>
<P>
   The standard remedy for recession is to generate spending,
either by running budget deficits to pay for public works or by
cutting taxes to stimulate private demand.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, that extra money soaks up the supply of unsold goods
and services, stimulates new capital investment, and creates jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But even when governments in Asia have been able to muster the
political will to take these steps, the program hasn't worked.
</P>
<P>
   Asia isn't in the grip of your standard-issue, plain-vanilla
recession. Nope, this is the deluxe model that combines falling
economic activity, constantly shrinking asset values, and a
seemingly endless credit crunch. Efforts to stimulate growth
disappear into these devastated economies without a ripple.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, for example, has poured trillions of yen into
infrastructure projects and cut taxes _ albeit timidly _ without
noticeable effect. Consumers are too afraid to spend _ the Japanese
and Koreans are clearly saving more in response to the crisis _ and
who can blame them?
</P>
<P>
   The official unemployment rate in Japan, the land of lifetime
employment, is now at 4.3 percent, and the real rate is probably
closer to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. consumers are spending every dollar they have
and then some. Personal income rose 0.2 percent in June, according
to the Department of Commerce, after an increase of 0.4 percent in
May. Personal expenditures rose 0.6 percent in June, after a 0.9
percent climb in May.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. consumers are doing exactly what their counterparts in Asia
aren't willing to do. In June, the U.S. trade deficit with the ten
major Asian nations totaled $15 billion _ that's up more than 40
percent from the deficit in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty clear where at least some of the dollars headed to
Asia are coming from. U.S. consumers are saving less and running up
more debt. In the first quarter of 1998, according to the
Department of Commerce, U.S. consumers saved just 0.6 percent. At
the same time, consumer debt grew at an annual rate of better than
6 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are now paying a record 15 percent of after-tax income
in interest and principal, according to Economic Analysis
Associates of Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   If you judge from those trends, the U.S. consumer sounds pretty
tapped out and poorly cast as the hero who will save the world
economy. But these numbers ignore the ``wealth effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve estimates that since 1994 the stock market
has added $12.5 trillion to the assets of U.S. households. Using
traditional estimates of the way this wealth effect flows from the
financial markets into consumer spending, that asset explosion will
add about $600 billion annually to consumer purchasing power in the
U.s.
</P>
<P>
   That number is both reassuring and scary. Reassuring because it
suggests the United States will be able to continue its role as
consumer of last resort into 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Scary because it suggests that U.S. consumers will play this
role only as long as a buoyant stock market makes them feel
wealthy. No one has any real idea, unfortunately, of how far the
market would have to fall before consumers would stop feeling
wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   No amount of buying by U.S. consumers can fix the structural
problems in the Korean, Japanese, or Brazilian economies. But it
can buy time for those economies to right themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It can pump liquidity into cash-starved companies in these
countries. And it can give countries _ China most importantly _ an
incentive for working to help fix the global economy rather than
pursuing a ruinous policy of beggar thy neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, it offers the hope that hard-pressed countries have
a way out of this fix. That's pretty important in a world that, for
the moment, seems to be out of alternative ideas. &QL;

consumer of last resort into 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Scary because it suggests that U.S. consumers will play this
role only as long as a buoyant stock market makes them feel
wealthy. No one has any real idea, unfortunately, of how far the
market would have to fall before consumers would stop feeling
wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   No amount of buying by U.S. consumers can fix the structural
problems in the Korean, Japanese, or Brazilian economies. But it
can buy time for those economies to right themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It can pump liquidity into cash-starved companies in these
countries. And it can give countries _ China most importantly _ an
incentive for working to help fix the global economy rather than
pursuing a ruinous policy of beggar thy neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, it offers the hope that hard-pressed countries have
a way out of this fix. That's pretty important in a world that, for
the moment, seems to be out of alternative ideas. &QL;

<P>
   The U.S. Federal Reserve is the most powerful central bank in
the world. It can send stock markets around the world soaring or
crashing with merely a word, and wipe out or create billions of
dollars with a hint. But it cannot fix what ails Japan with any
number of interest-rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
   That spells continued global economic trouble, since Japan is
the key to ending the economic slump in Asia. But the Fed believes
the current global financial and economic crisis is so serious that
even the recovery of the world's second-largest economy isn't the
most pressing problem of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the dilemma. Fed chairman Alan Greenspan and his
colleagues know that Japan is the key to global economic recovery.
But they also know that there's almost nothing they can do in the
short run to pull that country out of its paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   So the Fed has decided to put its muscle to work simply holding
the line in places like Brazil and the U.S. The hope is to prevent
a global recession _ even if that makes problems in Japan more
intractable.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is caught in what's called a liquidity trap, a kind of
economic black hole that shrugs off interest-rate reductions, huge
public-works programs, and even direct infusions of trillions of
yen.
</P>
<P>
   To fix the run-of-the-mill economic slowdown, a country's
government and central bank throw money at the problem. The
government adds to the country's money supply by running a budget
deficit _ funded by printing more dollars or yen or reals _ and
then puts that cash into the hands of businesses, which use it to
build roads or aircraft carriers or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   That creates demand for products from tar to tarmacs and, later,
for tires and shoes when the money trickles down to consumers in
the form of wages.
</P>
<P>
   An interest-rate cut by the central bank has much the same
effect. Lower rates makes it more attractive for banks to borrow
funds from the central bank _ which increases the money supply.
Lower rates encourage companies to borrow and expand and consumers
to put a few more dollars on their credit cards. That increases
demand and keeps the economy humming.
</P>
<P>
   Despite enough foot-dragging and posturing to get any sumo
wrestler booed out of Tokyo, the Japanese government has generally
followed that prescription recently. The government has thrown
trillions of yen into building roads.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent interest-rate cut by the Bank of Japan took the
official number down to a minuscule 0.25 percent: Banks can borrow
for what is effectively nothing. And last year the Bank of Japan
increased the country's money supply by more than 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But throwing money at the Japanese economy hasn't worked.
Business investment in the quarter that ran from April to June fell
by 9 percent from the same period a year earlier. The economy,
measured by gross domestic product, shrank by 0.8 percent in the
quarter and shows no signs of bottoming.
</P>
<P>
   What's happening to all the money that's being pumped into the
Japanese economy? It's getting stuffed into mattresses. Consumers,
for example, have increased their savings rate during this
downturn. This is characteristic of a liquidity trap.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are so scared about the future that they save every
cent they can. Businesses use every cent they can find to pay back
debt, since they worry that lenders will demand their money back
tomorrow. This behavior, of course, creates the very situation
businesses and consumers fear.
</P>
<P>
   The liquidity crunch has virtually paralyzed Japan's banking
system. What does a bank do right now when, thanks to the growth in
the money supply, it gets a credit to its account from the Bank of
Japan? It could make loans or even pay off some debt. Instead, most
Japanese banks are just keeping the money in reserve to meet the
demand for cash by Japanese households.
</P>
<P>
   A cut in U.S. interest rates won't fix Japan's liquidity problem
_ in fact, a cut could actually make it worse.
</P>
<P>
   Lower U.S. interest rates weaken the dollar and increase the
value of the yen, giving Japanese hoarders of yen one more reason
to hold on to their cash. And the Federal Reserve knows a U.S. rate
reduction makes it easier for the Japanese to avoid the painful
fundamental reforms needed to get the Japanese economy started on
the road to recovery.
</P>
<P>
   But those are minor issues for a Federal Reserve that is staring
at a global financial and economic crisis. Rate cuts may not help
Japan, but they should prevent the U.S. economy from slowing
further.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed cannot take the slightest risk of having the U.S. slide
into recession. The U.S. is one of only two growth engines left in
the world _ and is also the crucial market for the struggling
economies of Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   An interest-rate cut is the Fed's line in the sand _ the
recession stops here.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. interest-rate cut will also increase the pressure on
reluctant European central banks to follow suit. Greenspan would
prefer to make coordinated cuts with the Europeans. The Europeans,
however, have been resisting.
</P>
<P>
   Lower U.S. rates mean a cheaper U.S. dollar against the deutsche
mark, for example, and a more expensive currency spells trouble for
a country such as Germany, which is so heavily dependent on
exporting.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans, preoccupied with their monetary union, may still
hold out, but they know the Federal Reserve is willing to act
unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
   There's no guarantee that even rate cuts by the Federal Reserve,
the Bundesbank, and the Bank of England can stop the spread of
crisis. Interest-rate cuts in the U.S. could re-ignite inflation
here and re-inflate the stock market bubble.
</P>
<P>
   If the Federal Reserve moves and the crisis deepens, the bank
will lose crucial psychological capital. But when you run the most
influential central bank in the world, you really don't have the
option of sitting out a crisis like this. &QL;

   At 9 a.m., Jon Grossman, 43, is sitting behind a rosewood desk,
making weighty decisions about intellectual property, being called
``sir'' by the minions _ fitting for a partner in a major D.C. law
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours earlier, Jon Grossman was facedown in the dirt,
doing pushups as a drill instructor called him ``muffin ass.''
</P>

   The only weighty decision on Grossman's mind was whether he
could lift his sweaty carcass off the ground one more time so Sarge

of the two dozen other boot campers _ including me _ sprawled
beside him who paid good money to enlist in the Sergeant's Program.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Hell Lite, also known as fitness boot camp for
civilians _ a regimen of outdoor, co-ed stretching, running, and
calisthenics led by former military personnel at an obscenely early
hour of day.
</P>
<P>
   Drill instructors spend three weeks bullying your body into
shape through hand-holding, butt-kicking, name-calling, and
encouragement. Your mission: to be all you used to be. And to pass
a modified military fitness test _ a ten-minute mile, 100 crunches,
50 push-ups, 35 bench dips, and four pull-ups.
</P>
<P>
   If you're among those who graduate (about half do), you move on
to an even more intensive program. If not, you reboot until you
pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military drill instructor is the foremost known imposing
presence,'' says the Sarge, owner, instructor, and former naval
petty-officer Patrick Avon. ``And fear is an incredible
motivator.''
</P>
<P>
   The program's motto sums up its philosophy: No music. No
dancing. No mirrors. No machines. No juice bars. No spandex. No
crybabies. No refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the Sergeant's Program, which Avon has operated for nine
years in parks around Washington, D.C., is totally unlike joining a
gym or exercise class, where nobody knows if you show up, nobody
watches you work out, and nobody monitors your progress.
</P>
<P>
   The Sergeant's Program, which has about 650 enlistees and 25
instructors, takes its accountability for your body seriously.
Instructors call if you skip class. In fact, whole troops have been
known to show up at homes and offices to drag in MIAs.
</P>
<P>
   Drill instructors tell you how to eat. They show you the right
way to stretch, the right way to breathe when you run, the right
way to do push-ups. They watch you, correct you immediately when
you make mistakes, and they get you to do more than you'd ever do
on your own.
</P>
<P>
   That works for Jack Dolan, 35, a systems engineer from
Gaithersburg, Md. ``If I'm alone, I'll do 100 crunches,'' he says.
``If the instructor's there, he'll push and push and push until I
do 250. He yells at you and says, `Come on, man, you're better than
that!' And he does make you better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the pressure is on and the sweat is pouring, the
Sergeant's Program is also about having fun. Instructors keep
recruits smiling with hijinks, jokes, and plenty of verbal rewards.
</P>
<P>
   The sweaty masses of sleep-deprived survivors bond together,
too, in almost cult-like fashion. They coach one another in class.
Some become golf buddies outside class.
</P>
<P>
   And they learn how to be kids again. ``When children see a mud
puddle, they jump into it,'' says the 36-year-old Avon. ``When
40-year-olds see a mud puddle, they bitch about it. I get the
people who bitch about it and make them want to jump into it.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be in great shape to enlist. (But you will get
a health evaluation. And if you're over 40, you'll need a doctor's
note verifying that all parts are in working order.)
</P>
<P>
   Grossman couldn't do one unassisted pull-up when he started; a
couple of weeks later, he can do three. He used to falter after 40
crunches. Now 200 is no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Basic training costs $345 for three weeks, five days a week, 45
minutes to an hour a day. (Plus running homework if your instructor
is particularly sadistic.) Maintenance and rebooting costs $80 to
$120 a month, depending on the duration of punishment you sign up
for.
</P>
<P>
   The Sergeant's Program has 18 sites around Washington, D.C. and
two in Philadelphia. Expect sites in New York and Los Angeles early
next year and other big cities later.

<P>
   Variable annuities were once the hottest thing going in the
investment business. Despite the horrible battering they've
received in the press, they sold like crazy even last year _ a
whopping $87.8 billion worth, up almost 18 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the bad news. The 1997 tax law cut capital-gains tax
rates on long-term investments to as low as 10 percent and left
ordinary income-tax rates the same. This made mutual funds more
attractive, since the income from an annuity isn't considered a
capital gain.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of variable annuities fell 2.6 percent in the first
quarter of 1998 compared with the fourth quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   All this raises the question: Do variable annuities make sense
for anyone anymore?
</P>
<P>
   A variable annuity is essentially a mutual fund in a
life-insurance wrapper. You pay a lump sum up front or structure a
series of investments as you see fit; money can be put into stocks,
bonds, or mutual funds (each vehicle is known as a sub-account).
You then set up a series of payouts, usually to start at a
specified later date.
</P>
<P>
   Your assets are guaranteed by a death benefit _ if you die
before collecting all of your money, your estate will receive at
least as much as the initial cost of the annuity.
</P>
<P>
   Your returns are not guaranteed (hence ``variable'' versus
``fixed'' annuities), but you are allowed considerable freedom to
select where the money goes.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a mutual fund, which incurs capital-gains taxes each
year, a variable annuity allows you to invest tax-deferred _
meaning you put funds into one now and pay income taxes later as
you receive the money. You can also transfer money from sub-account
to sub-account without creating a taxable event.
</P>
<P>
   To help spur sales, the variable-annuity industry has made moves
over the past year or so to cut its charges and fees.
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock Mutual Life introduced its MarketPlace Variable
Annuity, which has lower mortality fees and no surrender charges.
Mortality expenses often run about 1 to 1.5 percent of the annual
value of the policy and pay for the guaranteed death benefit;
MarketPlace's mortality fees are just 0.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of surrender charges means that buyers no longer have
to pay hefty fees to withdraw their money early, though other
expenses still apply.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity, USAA, and Vanguard have also lowered their mortality
expenses. Variable Annuity Research and Data Service (based in
Marietta, Ga.) expects sales of variable annuities to increase this
year by 10 to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these positive steps, most people still should not buy a
variable annuity as an investment or an insurance vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Their fees are too high _ 2.09 percent a year on average, more
than 40 percent higher than the fees on the average mutual fund.
And the insurance coverage is negligible _ you have to die while
the account value is underwater for the death benefit to be
worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the tax-deferred aspect entices the uninformed. ``People
have such an aversion to taxes that they will buy anything,
including variable annuities,'' says Meir Statman, a finance
professor at Santa Clara University in Santa Clara, Calif., who
studies investor behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``How useful will they be? Who knows! It depends on your
situation when you cash it out.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 550. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Here are five scenarios that might help to make sense out of
variable annuities:
</P>
<P>
   1) YOU'VE HIT THE LIMIT ON RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTIONS. Investing
in a variable annuity is a great way to stash cash tax-deferred if
you're investing the maximum in your IRA and your 401(k) or Keogh
plan. If this is the case, make sure the next scenario also applies
to you.
</P>
<P>
   2) YOU HAVE AN EXTREMELY LONG INVESTMENT TIME HORIZON. Don't
think you can tap the kitty for a rainy day, like paying for your
child's college education, buying a second home, or purchasing a
Jaguar. The typical surrender charge is steep _ 7 percent if you
cash out in the first year, declining a percentage point every year
until it gets to zero by the seventh year.
</P>
<P>
   If you bail out before you're 59 and a half, you'll also have to
pay a 10 percent tax penalty. Figuring in all the fees, the
break-even point for a variable annuity with respect to a mutual
fund used to be seven to ten years. With the 1997 tax law, it's now
more like 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   So plan on holding on for 20 to 25 years, says Lynn Hopewell, a
financial planner in Fairfax, Va. ``It takes a long time to make it
pay off,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   3) YOU THINK YOU'LL NEED THE INCOME IN RETIREMENT. Have you
lived the high life? Sent your kids to private schools? Taken fancy
vacations? Bought expensive toys? Haven't stashed away enough money
for retirement? Then you may need those monthly annuity payouts
later. Buy a deferred annuity now, which pays off down the road a
ways, and switch in retirement to an immediate annuity, which
starts paying instantly. But remember: The monthly income payment
you receive will fluctuate with the value of the underlying fund.
</P>
<P>
   4) YOU'RE FIFTYSOMETHING AND SINGLE WITH NO DEPENDENTS, OR YOUR
SPOUSE OR HEIRS DON'T DEPEND ON YOU FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. Peter
Katt, a life-insurance advisor in Kalamazoo, Mich., likes to give
the example of Maxine Potter, a fictitious college professor who's
making good money from two books she has written.
</P>
<P>
   A widow with no children, she wants to retire early and buy a
house in Tucson, Ariz., so she can golf all year. So, starting at
age 53, she plows $1,200 a month in extra income into a deferred
variable annuity and then at 62 transfers it to an immediate
variable annuity, which sends her a check every month _ for life.
``That way, she's maximizing her income for when she needs it
later,'' Katt says.
</P>
<P>
   5) YOU MIGHT BE SUED OR HAVE TO FILE FOR PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY.
This is an extreme case, of course. But many states, including New
York, Florida, and Texas, protect some assets in variable annuities
from creditors. Doctors susceptible to malpractice lawsuits, take
heed and see your attorney.
</P>
<P>
   If any of these cases applies to you and you decide to buy a
variable annuity, then shop around. Many companies offer no-load _
i.e., no sales commission _ variable annuities with zero surrender
charges.
</P>

   Variable annuities were once the hottest thing going in the
investment business. Despite the horrible battering they've
received in the press, they sold like crazy even last year _ a
whopping $87.8 billion worth, up almost 18 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the bad news. The 1997 tax law cut capital-gains tax
rates on long-term investments to as low as 10 percent and left
ordinary income-tax rates the same. This made mutual funds more
attractive, since the income from an annuity isn't considered a
capital gain.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of variable annuities fell 2.6 percent in the first
quarter of 1998 compared with the fourth quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   All this raises the question: Do variable annuities make sense
for anyone anymore?
</P>
<P>
   A variable annuity is essentially a mutual fund in a
life-insurance wrapper. You pay a lump sum up front or structure a
series of investments as you see fit; money can be put into stocks,
bonds, or mutual funds (each vehicle is known as a sub-account).
You then set up a series of payouts, usually to start at a
specified later date.
</P>
<P>
   Your assets are guaranteed by a death benefit _ if you die
before collecting all of your money, your estate will receive at
least as much as the initial cost of the annuity.
</P>
<P>
   Your returns are not guaranteed (hence ``variable'' versus
``fixed'' annuities), but you are allowed considerable freedom to
select where the money goes.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a mutual fund, which incurs capital-gains taxes each
year, a variable annuity allows you to invest tax-deferred _
meaning you put funds into one now and pay income taxes later as
you receive the money. You can also transfer money from sub-account
to sub-account without creating a taxable event.
</P>
<P>
   To help spur sales, the variable-annuity industry has made moves
over the past year or so to cut its charges and fees.
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock Mutual Life introduced its MarketPlace Variable
Annuity, which has lower mortality fees and no surrender charges.
Mortality expenses often run about 1 to 1.5 percent of the annual
value of the policy and pay for the guaranteed death benefit;
MarketPlace's mortality fees are just 0.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of surrender charges means that buyers no longer have
to pay hefty fees to withdraw their money early, though other
expenses still apply.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity, USAA, and Vanguard have also lowered their mortality
expenses. Variable Annuity Research and Data Service (based in
Marietta, Ga.) expects sales of variable annuities to increase this
year by 10 to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these positive steps, most people still should not buy a
variable annuity as an investment or an insurance vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Their fees are too high _ 2.09 percent a year on average, more
than 40 percent higher than the fees on the average mutual fund.
And the insurance coverage is negligible _ you have to die while
the account value is underwater for the death benefit to be
worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the tax-deferred aspect entices the uninformed. ``People
have such an aversion to taxes that they will buy anything,
including variable annuities,'' says Meir Statman, a finance
professor at Santa Clara University in Santa Clara, Calif., who
studies investor behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``How useful will they be? Who knows! It depends on your
situation when you cash it out.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 550. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Here are five scenarios that might help to make sense out of
variable annuities:
</P>
<P>
   1) YOU'VE HIT THE LIMIT ON RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTIONS. Investing
in a variable annuity is a great way to stash cash tax-deferred if
you're investing the maximum in your IRA and your 401(k) or Keogh
plan. If this is the case, make sure the next scenario also applies
to you.
</P>
<P>
   2) YOU HAVE AN EXTREMELY LONG INVESTMENT TIME HORIZON. Don't
think you can tap the kitty for a rainy day, like paying for your
child's college education, buying a second home, or purchasing a
Jaguar. The typical surrender charge is steep _ 7 percent if you
cash out in the first year, declining a percentage point every year
until it gets to zero by the seventh year.
</P>
<P>
   If you bail out before you're 59 and a half, you'll also have to
pay a 10 percent tax penalty. Figuring in all the fees, the
break-even point for a variable annuity with respect to a mutual
fund used to be seven to ten years. With the 1997 tax law, it's now
more like 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   So plan on holding on for 20 to 25 years, says Lynn Hopewell, a
financial planner in Fairfax, Va. ``It takes a long time to make it
pay off,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   3) YOU THINK YOU'LL NEED THE INCOME IN RETIREMENT. Have you
lived the high life? Sent your kids to private schools? Taken fancy
vacations? Bought expensive toys? Haven't stashed away enough money
for retirement? Then you may need those monthly annuity payouts
later. Buy a deferred annuity now, which pays off down the road a
ways, and switch in retirement to an immediate annuity, which
starts paying instantly. But remember: The monthly income payment
you receive will fluctuate with the value of the underlying fund.
</P>
<P>
   4) YOU'RE FIFTYSOMETHING AND SINGLE WITH NO DEPENDENTS, OR YOUR
SPOUSE OR HEIRS DON'T DEPEND ON YOU FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. Peter
Katt, a life-insurance advisor in Kalamazoo, Mich., likes to give
the example of Maxine Potter, a fictitious college professor who's
making good money from two books she has written.
</P>
<P>
   A widow with no children, she wants to retire early and buy a
house in Tucson, Ariz., so she can golf all year. So, starting at
age 53, she plows $1,200 a month in extra income into a deferred
variable annuity and then at 62 transfers it to an immediate
variable annuity, which sends her a check every month _ for life.
``That way, she's maximizing her income for when she needs it
later,'' Katt says.
</P>
<P>
   5) YOU MIGHT BE SUED OR HAVE TO FILE FOR PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY.
This is an extreme case, of course. But many states, including New
York, Florida, and Texas, protect some assets in variable annuities
from creditors. Doctors susceptible to malpractice lawsuits, take
heed and see your attorney.
</P>
<P>
   If any of these cases applies to you and you decide to buy a
variable annuity, then shop around. Many companies offer no-load _
i.e., no sales commission _ variable annuities with zero surrender
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Among the best-performing: Janus Retirement Advantage, Vanguard
Variable Annuity Plan, and Ameritas No-Load Variable Annuity. Also,
respected teachers' pension-fund system TIAA-CREF plans to offer a
no-load variable annuity to the general public next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
   As New York City's largest used-book seller, Strand, at the
corner of 12th Street and Broadway, is a place where Manhattanites
go to browse through treasures of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few flights up in the same building, however, the
employees of Wit Capital have their attention fixed almost entirely
on the future.
</P>
<P>
   Wit, a registered broker-dealer, is a pioneer in the use of the
Internet to trade stock.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike online brokerages, which communicate with customers via
the Net but execute trades on the traditional exchanges, Wit is
attempting to create a whole new way for companies to sell stock to
investors and for investors to buy and sell directly with one
another.
</P>
<P>
   Founded by 37-year-old Andrew Klein, Wit was little known on
Wall Street when it opened for business in September 1997. That
changed abruptly last spring, when Robert Lessin, one of Wall
Street's best-connected mergers-and-acquisitions bankers, left his
position as vice-chairman of Salomon Smith Barney to become Wit's
chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, other topflight investment-banking pros, including
Matthew Carbone from Salomon and William Tkacs from Cowen &AMP; Co.,
joined the 43-year-old Lessin.
</P>
<P>
   Then Ronald Readmond, formerly vice-chairman of Charles Schwab &AMP;
Co., announced that he was signing on as Wit's president and chief
operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   What drew the likes of Lessin and Readmond to Wit was nothing
less than an opportunity to revolutionize the process of capital
formation _ or, as Lessin puts it, to ``democratize'' Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, to the extent that Wit or some other organization like
it one day succeeds, Wall Street's role as a middleman between the
owners and users of capital could be profoundly altered _ and
perhaps sharply diminished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within ten years I think we'll see the death of the floor on
the New York Stock Exchange and possibly the end of open-outcry
trading,'' says Bill Burnham, the senior analyst of electronic
commerce at Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be fewer exchanges globally, and individual retail
investors will have access to 24-hour trading worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street isn't exactly quaking in its boots just yet, and
Wit, for its part, has a long row to hoe just to survive as a
business, let alone threaten the established positions of the major
Wall Street firms.
</P>
<P>
   Its true significance at the moment is as a harbinger of the
upheaval that lies ahead for the Street. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Internet will make such dramatic change possible (and
inevitable) because it is the first medium capable of creating a
public market _ an electronic version of a trading pit or stock
exchange, where multiple participants can get together to trade.
</P>
<P>
   Wit founder Klein was among the first to recognize this. As a
young securities lawyer for Cravath, Swaine and Moore in New York
in the late 1980s, he was exposed to the huge fees that Wall Street
firms command _ particularly the sums spent as companies attempted
to raise capital through initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Klein resigned his lucrative job at Cravath to start a
microbrewery. Two years later, he took Spring Street Brewing public
in the first Internet-based IPO, raising $1.6 million for Spring
Street _ without any help from investment bankers _ from 3,500
individual investors. Many were fans of Wit beer, a spicy, cloudy
concoction akin to Belgian wheat beer.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1996, Klein launched the first Web-based trading
mechanism that enabled investors to buy and sell Spring Street
shares. A month later, he formed Wit Capital, borrowing the name _
and distinctive red exclamation-mark logo _ from the beer.
</P>
<P>
   His goal for Wit: ``To include individual investors in the
capital-raising process and create a better way for people to buy
and sell stocks,'' he says. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though little more than a year old, Wit has already participated
in more than 30 IPOs of common stock. It also recently won its
first assignment as an ``e-manager'' _ a term Klein coined to
describe Wit's role as the co-manager charged with distributing an
allotment of IPO stock through the electronic-brokerage community. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Initial public offerings have long been a source of frustration
to individual investors because Wall Street firms have
traditionally used their clout to reward only their favored
customers with allocations of new shares.
</P>
<P>
   Lessin notes, for example, that this was a common practice at
his former firm, Salomon Smith Barney, which reserved only a tiny
percentage of shares for the firm's retail customers _ even though
a retail broker at Solomon might have as much as $60 million under
management.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, when Wit co-manages an initial public offering, it
offers shares on a first-come, first-served basis both to its
clients and to those of other online brokers that join its
electronic syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   Lessin and Klein also say that, by reducing underwriting fees
and broadening the base of prospective customers, Wit's process
provides a better deal for corporations issuing stock.
</P>
<P>
   As Klein learned when he took Spring Street public, the Internet
can be used to identify buyers who are more likely to feel some
loyalty to the issuing company and view their purchase as a
long-term investment, as opposed to an opportunity to make a quick
buck by flipping the stock (reselling it quickly on the open
market). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the long term, Wit's success will hinge to a large degree
on its ability to deliver as an e-manager. It received a major vote
of confidence in August when EarthWeb, the Internet-based
online-services provider, agreed to place Wit smack alongside
bulge-bracket underwriters J.P. Morgan and Bear Stearns as a
co-manager of its initial stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   To win many more such assignments, Wit still needs to persuade
other online brokerage firms to join its e-syndicate. As of
September 1, it had reached agreements with Quick &AMP; Reilly,
Suretrade, Datek Online, and Wall Street Access.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. and E*Trade may prove more difficult to
crack because they already offer customers at least some access to
IPOs through relationships with more traditional investment banks.
</P>
<P>
   An equally important test of Wit's business strategy is just
beginning as the company unveils its next, and by far its most
ambitious, project _ the Digital Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   The DSM is a sophisticated Internet-based trading system
designed to allow individual investors to negotiate directly with
one another and buy and sell stocks within listed bid-asked spreads
in much the same way that institutional investors have long been
able to do.
</P>
<P>
   The concept itself is simple. DSM lets investors call up an
order book that includes the official bid and asked prices, as well
as indications from other investors who want to buy or sell a given
number of shares at various price points in between. Investors can
accept one of the existing orders, enter a new order, or try to
negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Wit modeled this system after the private
electronic-communications networks _ such as Instinct _ that
institutional investors, dealers, and market makers have long used
to trade stocks with one another.
</P>
<P>
   Investors should like the look and feel of the Digital Stock
Market, but a larger question is whether it will be able to attract
the order flow that markets need to run smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Atkin, president and CEO of Instinct, has seen other
technically advanced trading systems disappear into obscurity for
this very reason. ``Building the technology is only a quarter of
the battle,'' he says. Retail investors, says Atkin, want to know
that when it's time to sell there will be buyers ready and waiting.
</P>
<P>
   To provide that assurance, Wit, which has only 7,500
active-brokerage accounts of its own, is looking to broaden its
base of potential buyers and sellers by forming partnerships with
other firms.
</P>
<P>
   It is in talks with a number of electronic brokers, hoping to
entice them to use its Digital Stock Market by agreeing either to
split fees or to share equity stakes in the new market.
</P>
<P>
   One firm unlikely to participate: Datek Online, which already
operates a small-scale trading network for Nasdaq stocks, called
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Klein and Lessin have high hopes for the Digital Stock Market.
Even if it fails, they believe the paradigm shift that has already
begun in the capital-raising process is unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   As capitalists, they would like to cash in on this change as
well _ and perhaps if they succeed, they'll one day find their
story told in a book on sale downstairs at Strand. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   As New York City's largest used-book seller, Strand, at the
corner of 12th Street and Broadway, is a place where Manhattanites
go to browse through treasures of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few flights up in the same building, however, the
employees of Wit Capital have their attention fixed almost entirely
on the future.
</P>
<P>
   Wit, a registered broker-dealer, is a pioneer in the use of the
Internet to trade stock.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike online brokerages, which communicate with customers via
the Net but execute trades on the traditional exchanges, Wit is
attempting to create a whole new way for companies to sell stock to
investors and for investors to buy and sell directly with one
another.
</P>
<P>
   Founded by 37-year-old Andrew Klein, Wit was little known on
Wall Street when it opened for business in September 1997. That
changed abruptly last spring, when Robert Lessin, one of Wall
Street's best-connected mergers-and-acquisitions bankers, left his
position as vice-chairman of Salomon Smith Barney to become Wit's
chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, other topflight investment-banking pros, including
Matthew Carbone from Salomon and William Tkacs from Cowen &AMP; Co.,
joined the 43-year-old Lessin.
</P>
<P>
   Then Ronald Readmond, formerly vice-chairman of Charles Schwab &AMP;
Co., announced that he was signing on as Wit's president and chief
operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   What drew the likes of Lessin and Readmond to Wit was nothing
less than an opportunity to revolutionize the process of capital
formation _ or, as Lessin puts it, to ``democratize'' Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, to the extent that Wit or some other organization like
it one day succeeds, Wall Street's role as a middleman between the
owners and users of capital could be profoundly altered _ and
perhaps sharply diminished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within ten years I think we'll see the death of the floor on
the New York Stock Exchange and possibly the end of open-outcry
trading,'' says Bill Burnham, the senior analyst of electronic
commerce at Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be fewer exchanges globally, and individual retail
investors will have access to 24-hour trading worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street isn't exactly quaking in its boots just yet, and
Wit, for its part, has a long row to hoe just to survive as a
business, let alone threaten the established positions of the major
Wall Street firms.
</P>
<P>
   Its true significance at the moment is as a harbinger of the
upheaval that lies ahead for the Street. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Internet will make such dramatic change possible (and
inevitable) because it is the first medium capable of creating a
public market _ an electronic version of a trading pit or stock
exchange, where multiple participants can get together to trade.
</P>
<P>
   Wit founder Klein was among the first to recognize this. As a
young securities lawyer for Cravath, Swaine and Moore in New York
in the late 1980s, he was exposed to the huge fees that Wall Street
firms command _ particularly the sums spent as companies attempted
to raise capital through initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Klein resigned his lucrative job at Cravath to start a
microbrewery. Two years later, he took Spring Street Brewing public
in the first Internet-based IPO, raising $1.6 million for Spring
Street _ without any help from investment bankers _ from 3,500
individual investors. Many were fans of Wit beer, a spicy, cloudy
concoction akin to Belgian wheat beer.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1996, Klein launched the first Web-based trading
mechanism that enabled investors to buy and sell Spring Street
shares. A month later, he formed Wit Capital, borrowing the name _
and distinctive red exclamation-mark logo _ from the beer.
</P>
<P>
   His goal for Wit: ``To include individual investors in the
capital-raising process and create a better way for people to buy
and sell stocks,'' he says. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though little more than a year old, Wit has already participated
in more than 30 IPOs of common stock. It also recently won its
first assignment as an ``e-manager'' _ a term Klein coined to
describe Wit's role as the co-manager charged with distributing an
allotment of IPO stock through the electronic-brokerage community. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Initial public offerings have long been a source of frustration
to individual investors because Wall Street firms have
traditionally used their clout to reward only their favored
customers with allocations of new shares.
</P>
<P>
   Lessin notes, for example, that this was a common practice at
his former firm, Salomon Smith Barney, which reserved only a tiny
percentage of shares for the firm's retail customers _ even though
a retail broker at Solomon might have as much as $60 million under
management.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, when Wit co-manages an initial public offering, it
offers shares on a first-come, first-served basis both to its
clients and to those of other online brokers that join its
electronic syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   Lessin and Klein also say that, by reducing underwriting fees
and broadening the base of prospective customers, Wit's process
provides a better deal for corporations issuing stock.
</P>
<P>
   As Klein learned when he took Spring Street public, the Internet
can be used to identify buyers who are more likely to feel some
loyalty to the issuing company and view their purchase as a
long-term investment, as opposed to an opportunity to make a quick
buck by flipping the stock (reselling it quickly on the open
market). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the long term, Wit's success will hinge to a large degree
on its ability to deliver as an e-manager. It received a major vote
of confidence in August when EarthWeb, the Internet-based
online-services provider, agreed to place Wit smack alongside
bulge-bracket underwriters J.P. Morgan and Bear Stearns as a

TENNESSEE ON ITS GAME, DEFEATS EMOTIONALLY DRAINED KENTUCKY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ A measure of Tennessee's determination to
cling fiercely to its top-dog status occurred early in the third
quarter yesterday, when the Volunteers rose up and stopped Kentucky
three times from the 1-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Vols were holding a 31-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats finally scored _ barely _ on fourth down, but it
was of little help. The Vols (10-0, 7-0) cruised almost
effortlessly to a 59-21 triumph before a crowd of 107,252 at
Neyland Stadium to strengthen their position as the No. 1 team in
the Bowl Championship Series standings and The Associated Press
poll.
</P>
<P>
   It was also their 14th consecutive victory over Kentucky (7-4,
4-4), and secured a berth in the Southeastern Conference title game
on Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had great concern for the Kentucky offense, but our defense
may have played its best game,'' Vols coach Phillip Fulmer said.
``Maybe our offense did, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the circumstances of the week had some effect. You
have to feel for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky coach Hal Mumme also referred to the tragic events of
last Sunday, when a truck driven by Wildcats center Jason Watts
overturned and Kentucky football player Arthur Steinmetz and
Eastern Kentucky student Scott Brock were killed. Watts, who is
hospitalized, has been charged with manslaughter because of his
blood alcohol content.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a week of emotions surrounded by tragedy,'' Mumme
said. ``There's no way to describe it. It's been sad, a week of sad
losses. We didn't play well, focused, or with emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   They did, however, play with a certain reckless abandon. On six
occasions, the Wildcats gambled on fourth down in their own
territory. They failed five times, presenting the Vols with an
added flurry of points on short drives.
</P>
<P>
   But the Vols, who rolled up 466 yards and scored on eight
consecutive possessions, scarcely needed help. Using a pressure
defense to contain Kentucky's high-octane air attack, they cruised
to a 38-7 halftime lead and coasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing we wanted to do was put pressure on \RKentucky
QB\S Tim Couch,'' Fullmer said. ``We were sometimes blitzing an
extra linebacker, sometimes not _ but we wanted to hurry him and
keep him off balance. He's so good, you have to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Couch (35 of 56, one interception) threw for 337 yards but was
sacked six times and rarely had an opportunity to throw downfield.
The Kentucky ground game, meanwhile, weighed in with 39 yards
rushing.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee quarterback Tee Martin (13-20-0) threw for 189 yards
and ran for 63 more, directing a versatile Vols attack that
Kentucky's ``Black Flag'' defense couldn't handle.
</P>
<P>
   The Vols broke it open in the second period, when Martin fired a
55-yard pass to Cedrick Wilson to make it 21-7, followed quickly by
a 58-yard bolt from fullback Shawn Bryson that stretched the lead
to 21 points.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Kentucky shattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a lot of pressure on them with the pass rush, and that
was a big difference,'' linebacker Chris Ramseur said. ``We knew
they had a second-string center in there, and we capitalized on
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked a little confused out there, but I guess you'd say
they all looked like they really didn't have that fire in their
eyes.'' Extra points The winner of the game is normally awarded
possession of the Beer Barrel, a large beer keg that has served as
the game's trophy since 1925. In the wake of the fatal,
alcohol-related accident Sunday, the barrel did not make an
appearance this year. ... Tennessee set a school record for season
attendance this year, drawing an average of 106,914 fans per game.

NO. 2 KANSAS ST. OUTLASTS MISSOURI TO STAY UNBEATEN
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram

<P>
   COLUMBIA, Mo. _ Kansas State quarterback Michael Bishop did not
turn in a performance yesterday that is likely to cause any Heisman
Trophy voters to erase Texas' Ricky Williams from the top of their
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the Wildcats likely cause the Bowl Championship Series
computer to leap them past Tennessee or UCLA, both of whom won
convincingly yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   But both Bishop and his team simply did what they have done for
19 consecutive games _ win.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop accounted for 261 yards of total offense and two
touchdowns as Kansas State held off Missouri's spirited bid for a
program-shaking upset and escaped packed Faurot Field with a 31-25
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats, 11-0 and ranked No. 2 by The Associated Press, now
can sit back with their first-ever undefeated regular season and
await the Dec. 5 matchup in the Big 12 Championship against South
Division winner Texas A&AMP;M (10-1, 7-0), which yet must face
traditional foe Texas on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great feeling to be 11-0,'' Bishop said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It beats losing one, two or three,'' Wildcats coach Bill
Snyder said. ``I think it's a pretty special achievement for our
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a lot of undefeated football teams in the country
and probably not a lot from year to year. So to be one of the very
exclusive group is something I appreciate for our players. They're
proud of it, and I am, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Between now and the league championship game, the BCS will
release two more sets of weekly rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've proved we're good enough to be 11-0 right now,''
Wildcats defensive end Joe Bob Clements said. ``It's hard to say
we're better than other teams because we haven't played them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I can say we're better than the 11 teams we've
played on the day we played them. It's up to other people to decide
where they want to put us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats did not assure themselves of a continuing place in
the debate until Missouri quarterback Corby Jones overthrew two
receivers running deep across the middle on a fourth-and-15 at the
Kansas State 42 with 1:15 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Jones won the statistical war with Bishop, accounting for 249
yards passing and 63 running. But he wasn't good enough for
Missouri (7-4, 5-3 Big 12).
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole week we were determined to come out and shock the
world,'' said Missouri wide receiver John Dausman. ``We almost did
it. But almost doesn't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dausman, who is a backup, shocked a vaunted Kansas State
defense, ranked No. 2 nationally in pass efficiency, by catching
six passes for 169 yards. Included was a 20-yard touchdown pass
from Jones that closed the Tigers to 24-22 six seconds into the
fourth quarter. A two-point pass attempt _ necessitated because of
a missed kick after the second touchdown _ failed.
</P>
<P>
   But in a game of shifting momentum and big plays, Kansas State
responded. The Wildcats went 37 yards in eight plays after a short
punt. Frank Murphy scored after recovering his own fumble in the
end zone after losing the ball at the one with 8:28 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The best Missouri could do was a 29-yard field goal from Brian
Long with 5:49 to play after failing to get into the end zone from
first-and-goal at the 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our football team played an excellent game,'' Missouri coach
Larry Smith said. ``Kansas State is an excellent team, and it was
one of those games where you get a chance at the end. But it came
down to that, and we didn't have quite enough to get us in the end
zone one more time.''

D-BACKS THROWING RIGHT PITCH 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Fact: The Diamondbacks' .246 batting average was the
worst among the 30 major league clubs last season.
</P>
<P>
   Additional facts: Teams with seven of the top eight staff ERAs
in the National League had winning records. In the American League,
it was five of the top six with winning records.
</P>
<P>
   Another fact: Of the remaining 16 clubs, only two others (Texas
and the Chicago Cubs) managed to win more games than they lost.
</P>
<P>
   When the inaugural Diamondbacks season ended and the team had
lost 97 of its 162 games, finishing with the third-worst record in
the majors, managing general partner Jerry Colangelo, during a
state of the franchise summation, cited the importance of pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's not quite time to erect a statue of Colangelo for some
grand revelation, but at least it didn't take long for the big
cheese to discover what this ballclub needs.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Colangelo began addressing the club's most pressing
need when he lured Todd Stottlemyre to the Valley. &QL; 
Braves have right idea &QL; 
Sure, it took 32 million reasons for Stottlemyre to decide to sign
his name on the bottom of a four-year contract. Whatever the
rationale, it's a move in the right direction for an organization
that seems hellbent on contending sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   The common denominator among all successful clubs starts and
ends with its starting rotation. Say what you want about the
Atlanta Braves and the fact that they have only one World Series
championship to show for their run this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look below their postseason failures, and arguably the
best rotation in 30 years leaps out as the primary reason for the
Braves' success in the 1990s. Sheer muscle is impressive to look at
in the middle of July, but it gets you nowhere in October.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado had the best batting average and St. Louis hit the most
home runs in the NL. Players from each club watched the playoffs at
home. Seattle socked more home runs (234) than any club in the
majors. The Mariners barely managed to elude the AL West cellar.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' AL-best batting average was supposed to be a major
concern and obstacle for the Yankees in the first round of the
playoffs. Yankees pitchers stopped the Rangers, who managed to
score one run in three games while batting .141.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pitching first, second and third that matters most,'' St.
Louis pitching coach Dave Duncan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks recognize that the quickest way to contend is
by building a rotation worthy of striking fear into opponents.
Stottlemyre may seem like a .500 pitcher, but this is a guy who has
gained the reputation as a big game pitcher because of his passion
for winning.
</P>
<P>
   Is $32 million more than a pitcher with a 123-110 career record
should be receiving? Absolutely. But in an era where there is such
a premium on pitching, it's what the market bears that determines
salaries. Detroit had offered $28 million for four years for
Stottlemyre. St. Louis was willing to go as high as $26 million.
</P>
<P>
   If it took an extra $1 million per season to land a top pitcher,
then the Diamondbacks made the right decision. Throwing Stottlemyre
into the mix with Andy Benes and promising left-handers Brian
Anderson and Omar Daal gives Arizona an envious rotation. &QL; 
Confidence is key &QL; 
In baseball, it all comes down to the mental side of the game. The
separation of talent between the top players and the bottom-rung
players is basically small. Confidence plays a far bigger role in
this game than is generally recognized.
</P>
<P>
   When Atlanta's players take the field with Greg Maddux, Tom
Glavine or John Smoltz on the mound, they've mentally notched a
victory before the first pitch is thrown. Those pitchers combined
to win 59 percent of the games they started.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's top three starters _ Darryl Kile, Pedro Astacio and
Jamey Wright _ won 34 percent of their starts. Don't forget, the
Rockies' .291 average was the best in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   One final fact: Pitching wins ballgames, plain and simple. &QL;

THIBAULT HAPPY TO LEAVE MONTREAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Playing for the fabled Montreal Canadiens can be a lot like
following Pavarotti to the microphone at a karaoke bar. You're
constantly being compared to previous greatness, and if you can't
cut it, the fans and the media let you have it.
</P>
<P>
   Take goalie Jocelyn Thibault. He kept his opinions to himself
while he was in Montreal the past two-plus seasons, but he didn't
shy away from bashing the contemptuous atmosphere there after last
week's trade to the Chicago Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been living through some kind of hell. I feel like a free
man now,'' Thibault said. ``People eat hockey there. When they sit
down at breakfast, they talk hockey. When they sit down at lunch,
they talk hockey. When they sit down at dinner, they talk hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   It was doubly rough on Thibault, though, because he was the
goalie the Canadiens got in exchange for trading St. Patrick Roy to
Colorado in that unforgettable Dec. 6, 1995, trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get traded for a legend, they expect you to play like
a legend, even at 20 or 21,'' said Thibault, 23, who visits the
Valley on Tuesday. ``I did my best, but I guess it wasn't good
enough for the people there.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes General Manager Bobby Smith, who scored the Stanley
Cup-winning goal for Montreal in 1986, knows what it can be like.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I was there when I was in my prime rather than at the
beginning of my career or at the end of it,'' Smith said. &QL; 
The magic bus
</P>
<P>
   A funny thing happened on the Detroit Red Wings' bus from
Calgary to Edmonton last week. As Coach Scotty Bowman stepped onto
the bus to leave the team hotel to the airport, a bellman came
running out with a note saying the team's charter flight had been
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the plane had been hit on the tarmac by a truck that
cleans toilets, ripping a huge hole in the fuselage. The Red Wings,
Bowman informed his team, would have to bus it all the way to
Edmonton _ a three-hour trip with the bus completely packed, one to
a seat.
</P>
<P>
   After losing six times in eight games, they responded with a
huge 6-2 win over the Oilers the next night, prompting associate
coach Dave Lewis to say, ``That bus trip was a great remedy. It was
just what the doctor ordered. We got back to basics, back to where
we came from. Back to our roots. It was like being back in
juniors.''
</P>
<P>
   No one actually saw the hole in the plane, of course, which
prompted the rumor: Did Bowman, the master motivator, cook up the
whole story and bribe the bellman? Sounds like something he might
pull. &QL; 
Rough boys
</P>
<P>
   If it seems there have been an alarming number of suspensions
and fines doled out this young season, there have. Colin Campbell,
the NHL's new director of hockey operations, has been a busy, busy
man handing out the discipline.
</P>
<P>
   After slapping Tampa Bay's Andrei Nazarov with a seven-game
suspension Thursday for cross-checking Colorado's Cam Russell in
the face, Campbell dished out 17 different fines and a total of 46
games in suspensions, including lost pay. Last year at this time,
the league had issued only nine fines and a total of six games to
suspension.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers will grow on Monday. That's when the Kings' Matt
Johnson has his hearing with Campbell in New York to discuss
Wednesday's ugly incident when Johnson knocked out the Rangers'
Jeff Beukeboom with a sucker punch _ a forearm shiver to the back
of the head. Expect him to get seven to 10 games, minimum. &QL; 
The real me
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver Canucks Coach Mike Keenan, who on Wednesday became
just the sixth head coach in NHL history to capture 500 career
wins, said his reputation as a no-nonsense, too-intense,
power-hungry, money-spending, player-bashing enigma is a
media-manufactured myth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a label that will be with me for some time,'' he said.
``I know it's good copy, but people have a three-second exposure of
you and they think they know you. The image perpetuates itself, and
it isn't even true.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes forward Rick Tocchet played for Keenan in Philadelphia
and knows him well. He respects him, too. But listen to Tocchet
long enough, and at least part of ``Iron Mike's'' reputation seems
well deserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike's a great guy, but he's always been his own man,''
Tocchet said. ``Most coaches today _ I should say a lot of coaches
_ ask around and get a lot of advice before they do anything. Not
him. He makes a decision and runs with it, whether it's right or
wrong. He'll be the first guy to tell you he's made his share of
mistakes, but hey, his record speaks for itself.'' &QL; 
Goin' mobile
</P>
<P>
   In a span of only three weeks, 22-year-old forward Roman Vopat
found himself traded three times and playing for four different NHL
clubs. Los Angeles dealt him to Colorado, which moved him to
Chicago, which shipped him to Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget, he originally was drafted by the St. Louis
Blues and played briefly for the Roadrunners after being traded to
the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unbelievable,'' Vopat said of his recent wild ride. ``I
can't even say how I felt. I was 19 and thought I was going to stay
in L.A., but I got traded after two years. Soon as you get traded,
you get traded again? Three times in three weeks? That hurts.'' &QL;

WILLIAMS MAY HAVE TO CRAWL BACK TO YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The market for All-Star center fielder  &UR; Bernie Williams does not
appear to be anything near the feeding frenzy agent  &UR; Scott Boras
had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   With the news that Williams had turned down the Yankees' offer
for a five-year deal worth $60 million, the stark reality is that
Williams may find himself with no suitors.
</P>
<P>
   A list that started with Los Angeles, Colorado, Texas, Arizona,
Baltimore, Boston and the Yankees almost has dried up to the point
where Williams may find himself having to take far less money than
he envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   Boras insists that his client has a seven-year offer on the
table. If so, Williams better jump at it soon. The Diamondbacks
have not made an offer and have their eyes set on  &UR; Randy Johnson
over Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers and Rockies went in different directions when they
signed center fielders of their own _  &UR; Devon White and  &UR; Darryl
Hamilton, respectively. Baltimore insists it will not make an offer
to Williams.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Boston and the Yankees, who have said the five-year,
$60 million offer is as high as they will go. Take away  &UR; Pedro
 &UR; Martinez's six-year, $75 million contract (which was more to cover
tracks for the departed  &UR; Roger Clemens) and history indicates the
Red Sox will not go as high as Boras and Williams would like.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, imagine being Williams and playing for the Red Sox
next season. Say Boston stumbles, which can happen considering the
career years they had from  &UR; Tim Wakefield and  &UR; Bret Saberhagen and
the loss of
 &UR; Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   If the Red Sox bumble their way to a sub-.500 record, whom will
the testy fans turn their anger towards? General Manager  &UR; Dan
Duquette will quietly hide in his perch high above Fenway Park
while Williams will be in center field every day, in the open for
all the booing to rain down on him.
</P>
<P>
   Williams should think again about that Yankees offer. Remember,
there's no place like home. &QL; 
Godzilla lives &QL; 
Japanese fans attending one of the seven games between All-Stars
from U.S. and Japanese leagues must have thought the fabled green
reptilian monster was attacking their shores again.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland Indians Manager  &UR; Mike Hargrove put out a lineup for
one of the games in which the starting lineup had combined for 349
home runs last season. The starters:  &UR; Andruw Jones (31),  &UR; Nomar
Garciaparra (35),
 &UR; Carlos Delgado (38),  &UR; Sammy Sosa (66),  &UR; Manny Ramirez (45),  &UR; Vinny
 &UR; Castilla (46),  &UR; Javier Lopez (34),  &UR; Jason Giambi (27) and  &UR; Damion
Easley (27). &QL; 
No Gambler here &QL; 
 &UR; Kenny Rogers, who two weeks ago exercised his right and demanded
that Oakland trade him, has changed his mind after learning that he
will not be eligible for free agency until 2002 if he is traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping we're able to work something out in a day or two
with Kenny so that he will return to Oakland next year,'' Athletics
General Manager  &UR; Billy Beane said. ``I think it will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers was 16-8 with a 3.17 ERA for the last-place A's. The
left-hander changed his mind once he discovered that Oakland was
not going to hold him to his 2000 option and he could file for free
agency after next season. &QL; 
Our kind of guy &QL; 
This is from a paid obituary that ran in both the ``Seattle Times''
and ``Seattle Post-Intelligencer'' last week. It reads, in part:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dick Upton, 71, from Seattle died on Veterans Day. He was a
knowledgeable and passionate baseball fan who enjoyed
second-guessing (Mariners GM)  &UR; Woody Woodward. He finally succumbed
quickly after hearing about the  &UR; Paul Spoljaric for  &UR; Mark Leiter
trade, which occurred just a few days earlier. He was quite a guy.
</P>
<P>
   He left his first wife to play on  &UR; Eddie Feigner's fast-pitch
softball champs; he drove the team bus for the Tri-City Atoms for
22 years before finding his niche in car rental business. &QL; 
THE HIT LIST &QL; 
 &UR; Guess they're happy where they  &UR; are: The Tampa Bay Devil Rays,
losers of 99 games in their inaugural season, have made exactly
zero trades since the four expansion draft day deals they made on
Nov. 18, 1997. By the way, every one else has made at least one
trade in that span.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Finally, one for the Rocket: With four sons,  &UR; Roger
 &UR; Clemens had vowed to pass each one a Cy Young Award trophy. Now
that he has won his fifth, it seems he'll get to keep one for
himself.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Pepe Frias.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Honest, I pitch in the majors: Tampa Bay reliever
 &UR; Scott Aldred appeared in 48 games last season without recording a
victory, loss or save. The previous record for securing non-vital
stats belonged to  &UR; Mike Flanagan, who appeared in 42 games in 1992
without a decision or save. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL; 
Texas'  &UR; Rick Helling became only the second 20-game winner in the
past 20 years to receive no Cy Young Award votes. Helling joined
Kansas City's  &UR; Dennis Leonard, a 20-game winner in 1980 who was
shut out of the Cy Young balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati combined to go 6-26 against the NL's division
champions _ Atlanta, Houston and San Diego. Against the rest of the
league, the Reds were 71-59.
</P>
<P>
   If Cleveland is successful in signing free-agent second baseman
 &UR; Roberto Alomar, the Indians will have a combined 18 Gold Gloves up
the middle when you include catcher  &UR; Sandy Alomar, shortstop  &UR; Omar
Vizquel and center fielder  &UR; Kenny Lofton.
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim Angels are furious with the Dodgers, who want to
shorten their annual preseason Freeway Series from three games to
one in order to bring in the Yankees for a two-game series. The
Dodgers want the Angels to be a standby, just in case the Yankees
back out of the deal. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL; 
Now that  &UR; Ken Caminiti is officially gone, San Diego is turning its
attention toward  &UR; Robin Ventura, who would love to play for the
Padres. San Diego, of course, wants Ventura to come as cheaply as
possible, which, in current terms, would be no less than $8 million
per season.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets have discussed the possibility of trading for
Milwaukee All-Star second baseman  &UR; Fernando Vina, who nearly went
to Atlanta before the Braves got a better deal from Cincinnati two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Cubs are taking a long look at third baseman  &UR; Sean
Berry, who became very available last week when Houston signed
 &UR; Caminiti. Berry hit .314 with 13 home runs for the Astros while
earning $1 million. &QL;

requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To, and

   &UR; CALIFORNIA'S OVER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Louis B. Jones. Vintage Contemporaries, $13.
</P>
<P>
   In detailing the narcissistic foibles of a hippie family in the
1970s, this novel strives to capture the era's hypersincerity and
inflated sense of destiny. The result is ``a satirical elegy for
the age of dime-store Zen,'' Walter Kirn said here last year. ``The
book is as light and swirly and eccentric as its Marin County
setting.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MY NAME ESCAPES ME: THE DIARY OF A RETIRING ACTOR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Alec Guinness. Penguin, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from this lively journal undertaken at the age of 80,
the versatile and idiosyncratic actor still has plenty to say. He
holds forth in charming and humorous fashion on everything from the
English weather to politics to his warm friendships with pets and
humans, not to mention the performances of other actors. Through it
all, ``Guinness remains pungently human, warts and all,'' John
Simon wrote in the Book Review in 1997. ``Sir Alec is an
accomplished writer, both in extended passages and in finely
etched, memory-hugging one-liners.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOB THE GAMBLER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Frederick Barthelme.
</P>
<P>
   Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $12.
</P>
<P>
   This novel focuses on the effects of compulsive gambling on a
family that wagers its comfortable life-style on a chance to escape
the banality of middle-class existence. ``It is Barthelme's
peculiar post-modern gift to be able to invert the easy ironies of
contemporary life and reveal the truths beneath them,'' A.O. Scott
said here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JAPAN: A REINTERPRETATION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Patrick Smith. Vintage, $14.
</P>
<P>
   A journalist punctures the postwar myth of a single-minded Japan
Inc., content with conformity and dependency on the West, and
instead finds a troubled society struggling to reinvent itself in
the absence of any meaningful democracy. Last year our reviewer,
Frank Gibney, called this ``a stimulating, provocative book.''
 &UR; GEISHA &LR; , by Liza Crihfield Dalby (University of California,
$17.95), tells of an American doctoral candidate who traveled to
Japan in the mid-1970s to study the female entertainers known as
geisha and wound up working as one. Her account, which has been
reissued with a new preface, is marked by ``delicate observation
and subtle common sense,'' Donald Rich wrote here in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SKY, THE STARS, THE WILDERNESS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Rick Bass. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $12.
</P>
<P>
   These three novellas cover a lot of ground _ from Canada to
Mississippi _ but they share a precise observation of nature that
is both unsentimental and ecstatic. ``Reading this book has made me
glad ... that there are still writers who can bring the wilderness
back alive and pin it to the page,'' Michael Gorra said here last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A BOOK OF MEMORIES  &LR;  By Peter Nadas. Translated by Ivan
Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Penguin, $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   This large, philosophically complex Hungarian novel transposes
two elaborately linked Proustian narratives of consciousness to the
universe of communist East Berlin and Budapest. ``The terrain of
Eastern European experience ... gains an amplitude and an
illumination from the painstaking attentiveness, the penetration
with which it is imagined and contemplated,'' Eva Hoffman wrote
here last year.  &UR; THE LAND OF GREEN PLUMS &LR; , by Herta Mueller,
translated from the German by Michael Hofmann (Hydra
Books/Northwestern University, $14.95), is a grim novel about a
group of young Romanians persecuted as dissidents during the
dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu. ``Mueller's vision ... reads
like a kind of fairy tale on the mingled evils of gluttony,
stupidity and brutality,'' Larry Wolff wrote here in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STEPHEN FOSTER AND THE RISE OF AMERICAN POPULAR CULTURE  &LR;  By
Ken Emerson. Da Capo, $16.95.
</P>
<P>
   The creator of ``Oh! Susanna,'' ``Camptown Races'' and other
enduring tunes from the 1800s was the first American songwriter to
achieve artistic independence from Europe. This is ``a vigorous,
thoroughly researched, amiably chatty tour through his life and
times,'' Margo Jefferson wrote here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; REQUIRED READING: WHY OUR AMERICAN CLASSICS MATTER NOW  &LR;  By
Andrew Delbanco.
</P>
<P>
   Noonday/Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $12.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to give new urgency to the works of Melville, Thoreau
and nine other writers, a humanities professor argues that the best
American writing reflects political values in line with those of
liberal democracy. ``Delbanco's essays are effortlessly erudite and
smoothly readable,'' Jonathan Rosen said here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PR! A SOCIAL HISTORY OF SPIN  &LR;  By Stuart Ewen. Basic Books,
$17.
</P>
<P>
   In tracing the evolution of public relations, the author shows
how the hype machine has persuaded Americans to buy everything from
new cars to new wars, and how it has undermined our political
discourse. Last year in these pages, Judith Newman called this an
``exhaustive and ambitious study.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE WONDER WORKER  &LR;  By Susan Howatch. Fawcett Columbine, $14.
</P>
<P>
   A young woman's obsession with the charismatic leader of a
London parish sets off a chain of events that includes a possible
murder and a suicide. Last year our reviewer, Betsy Groban, said
that despite its implausible ending, this is ``an absorbing
novel.''

ASU CAN'T STOP LEAKS FROM HEART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - If an autopsy were performed on Arizona State's
season, the first thing uncovered would be a weak heart.
</P>
<P>
   There lies the key clue of how a team some fingered for the
Fiesta Bowl is in danger of its first losing season since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Others became evident: injuries, unrealistic expectations,
unfulfilled potential. But the glaring personality trait to arise
from ASU's 5-5 start is that it is a team that cracks under
adversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ever think it's been a question of this team caring or
wanting to win,'' ASU Coach Bruce Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   Caring isn't always enough, and the 1998 Sun Devils appear to be
everything the 1996 team wasn't. That group found ways to win. This
team finds ways to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Never underestimate the right mix of personalities. ASU lacks
the leadership that players like Jake Plummer and Pat Tillman
brought, athletes who practically willed those around them to play
better.
</P>
<P>
   This team's shortcomings were apparent from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Sun Devils played evenly with Washington during
much of the season opener, they collapsed down the stretch and were
unable to stop the Huskies on a fourth-and-17 play with less than a
minute remaining. Quarterback Brock Huard connected with tight end
Reggie Davis for a 63-yard scoring play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just found a way,'' Huard said afterward. ``Maybe we just
believed in ourselves more.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder acknowledged that it took days for the Sun Devils to
recover. They went up to Brigham Young following a poor week of
practice, and it showed. The offense managed just six points as ASU
lost by 20.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils beat North Texas, 34-15, in an uninspiring effort
and played better in defeating Oregon State, 24-3. But Snyder
admitted he still had concerns about the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still not where we believe we can be,'' he said. ``We're
not putting together enough consistent efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the most telling statistic about ASU's emotional state is
that its losses always come in pairs. A defeat seems to wipe out
the team for a good seven days.
</P>
<P>
   The loss to Washington was followed by the humiliating defeat to
BYU. A loss to Southern California was followed by a humiliating
defeat to Notre Dame. This doesn't fare well for Friday's game
against Arizona, since the Sun Devils are coming off a loss to
Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ASU can only hope a bye week will negate that statistic.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder wasn't prepared for this personality trait, nor was he
prepared for what else came his way:
</P>
<P>
   Injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Every team faces them, but the Sun Devils continued to get
kicked where it counts.
</P>
<P>
   Tailback J.R. Redmond has been limited much of the season
because of toe and ankle problems. Quarterback Ryan Kealy is coming
off arthroscopic surgery on his right knee. And the secondary . . .
where do you start?
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils lost top reserve Courtney Hysaw during camp and
James Dunn early in the season. Starting strong safety Christon
Rance, who was beginning to grow comfortable in his role, missed
ASU's last two games because of a knee injury and will not play
against the Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   Kyion Grayes has been suspended from the team, and a thigh
contusion has limited Courtney Palmore.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, the Sun Devils' starting secondary,
primarily free safety Mitchell Freedman and cornerback J'Juan
Cherry, has been so banged up this year that it rarely practices.
That only hurts.
</P>
<P>
   ASU has several other players in those positions that hardly
play, suggesting that the Sun Devils need to do a better job in
evaluating numbers and talent while recruiting the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   The sophomore jinx.
</P>
<P>
   Kealy had a tough act to follow _ his own _ considering his
standout freshman year, but his struggles this season have been a
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Having a team collapse around him may have been too much of a
burden for Kealy to bear. He admitted that he put too much pressure
on himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stopped going out there and having fun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unrealistic expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Having the national championship game in Sun Devil Stadium was
just too tantalizing for some.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder acknowledged that he had concerns about his team in the
preseason but was thrust into an awkward position: How do you say
you're not that good when everyone else says you are?
</P>
<P>
   ``There were things I saw,'' he said. ``But it's a difficult
situation when there is so much preseason attention your way.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder's biggest concerns were on defense. Junior college
transfers Junior Ioane and Erik Flowers have big-time potential,
but they didn't transfer until spring, and the coach feared their
development would take awhile.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Larry Johnson for academic reasons was going to hit
the linebacking unit hard.
</P>
<P>
   He was right on both accounts. But he probably never dreamed
just how costly it would be. &QL;

CARDINALS TOY WITH NO-HUDDLE OFFENSE  
 PLOY COULD HELP PLUMMER CURE 1ST-HALF BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Cardinals don't plan to ask Jake Plummer to
drop back and chuck the playbook into the Potomac River.
</P>
<P>
   They are not ready to scrap their offense for sandlot plays.
</P>
<P>
   They just want to run it quicker when they visit the Washington
Redskins this afternoon. About two quarters quicker.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for the Cardinals (5-5), who hope to go above the
.500 mark for good in their quest for an NFC wild-card playoff
spot, has been their lifeless first-half offense.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half of the past three games, they've been almost
unstoppable. Last week they outscored the Dallas Cowboys, 21-7, in
the second half as Plummer passed for 314 of his 465 yards using a
no-huddle attack. In the second half of the past three games,
Plummer is 44 of 66 for 606 yards, four touchdowns and no
interceptions after digging first-half holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we could play the third quarter first,'' said wide
receiver Rob Moore. &QL; 
First-half fix? &QL; 
That gives rise to suspicion that the Cardinals might have found
the key to unlock their early-game woes. That and the fact that
they practiced the no-huddle all week. They've fed the rumor mill,
dropping hints that they will use it early in hopes of keeping the
Redskins' defense off-balance, in turn boosting their own
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Or it all could be a carefully crafted smoke screen, only a ruse
to give the Redskins one more thing to think about while preparing
on their practice field.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals might really be more intent on running the ball
down the middle of the Washington defense. After all, in a 29-27
comeback win over the Redskins in Sun Devil Stadium two weeks ago,
the Cardinals rushed for a season-high 187 yards, their most in 38
games. But then, Plummer set a club record by completing 15
straight passes after halftime in the comeback. He also passed for
a Cardinals rookie-record four touchdowns against the Redskins last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Boomer Esiason, not using a no-huddle but getting
the team in and out of the huddle fast and using a quick count,
dinked and dunked the Redskins for a Cardinals-record 522 passing
yards in an overtime win.
</P>
<P>
   If it turns out that the only huddle the Cardinals call this
week is the one to decide whether to use the no-huddle, that would
be great fun, according to Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Backup quarterback) Dave Brown put it perfectly when he said
the no-huddle is organized chaos,'' Plummer said. You're out there
running around. You know the plays. The defense is getting tired
because those guys are not even in their stance yet when you snap
the ball. They're waiting for their call to come in. You can create
some confusion, some panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun. It's a good mix-up if you're doing it well like we
had to last week.'' &QL; 
Bills benefited &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There certainly is precedent for playing no-huddle the entire
game. The Buffalo Bills in the early 1990s went to four straight
Super Bowls using it in their K-Gun Offense. The difference is the
Bills ran essentially a two-minute offense with minimum changes of
personnel packages. The Cardinals run their regular offense, making
changes in personnel groupings according to down-and-distance
situations.
</P>
<P>
   The K-Gun took the Bills to four straight Super Bowls, but they
didn't win any. That's important to note, said Cardinals backup
center Mike Devlin, who played for Buffalo during that era.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an offense that can help you beat average teams, but good
teams have enough depth to deal with it. That's what I thought,''
Devlin said. ``At Buffalo it was beautiful to see, beautiful to be
in it. The best thing is that by the third and fourth quarter,
except for the really good teams that could bring in waves and
waves of people, it wears down the pass rush to almost nothing. Not
many teams in the NFL are two or three deep now.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer is not yet to be confused with Bills quarterback Jim
Kelly, the trigger man of the K-Gun. Moore, Frank Sanders and Eric
Metcalf, however, arguably are as effective as Buffalo wide-outs
Don Beebe, Andre Reed and James Lofton. Surprising Cardinals tight
end Johnny McWilliams still isn't quite a Pete Metzelaars. And
running back Adrian Murrell, while capable of making more out of
little, isn't in a class with the Bills' Thurman Thomas. &QL; 
Good for Plummer &QL; 
Yet the no-huddle does seem to fit the skills and psyche of Plummer
and his offensive players. He is at his best when moving, whether a
designed rollout or a scramble. He could draw the plays in the
dirt, according to Anthony Munoz, a Hall of Fame offensive tackle
who now is an analyst for ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have a young quarterback as mobile as Jake that
can do so many things on the move, create plays, I think you need
to do a little more of that,'' Munoz said last week on KTAR-AM's
``620 Sportsline.'' ``You need to be on the cutting edge,
especially as specialized as defenses are adjusting to the
offensive personnel. I think this is a way to keep a defense off
balance. It was obvious the Cardinals were able to do that late in
the second half of the Dallas game. They were down, they didn't
have anything to lose, they said, `Let's go out and have fun.' Jake
put up some great numbers. They were one score from tying that
thing up and going to overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a matter of how you use it. There is a lot of
perception that it's a hurry-up offense. It's really a matter of
getting to the line, locking that defensive linemen into his
stance, looking it over, and giving Jake the opportunity to call
it. There are very few downsides. The pluses outweigh them. Jim
Kelly was very successful doing that. It needs to come back,
especially with what is going on with defenses now.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin thinks that assessment is reasonable
but not necessarily an indication of what the Cardinals will do
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Jake has the ability to make plays when things
break down around him,'' Tobin said. ``I don't know that running a
no-huddle makes him more prone to making those kind of plays. He's
got the option when a play breaks down of scrambling and doing all
the things he's capable of doing whether the play was called in the
huddle or at the line of scrimmage. It's what happens after the
snap that's relevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The no-huddle helped us last week, but last week was a unique
situation. We were 28 points behind. Their defense probably played
a little different than if it was 7-0.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin faced Kelly and the K-Gun in the AFC while Tobin was
defensive coordinator at Indianapolis. He gained further insight
into the no-huddle after Ted Marchibroda, who was offensive
coordinator at Buffalo when the K-Gun was installed, moved over to
the Colts staff with Tobin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot like the run-and-shoot, which is out of the league
right now, in that when you run it, usually yardage went up and
scoring went up,'' Tobin said. ``The flip side was the other team
scored more. When you have three-and-outs you use very little time
off the clock, which puts the other team's offense on the field
more than it normally would be.'' &QL; 
Team effort &QL; 
Plummer wouldn't necessarily be on his own to read the defense and
call a play at the line. With the radio receiver in his helmet,
offensive coordinator Marc Trestman, no stranger to the no-huddle
himself, still has input. The objectives would be moving quickly to
prevent the defense from making situational personnel adjustments
and simply tiring out the pass rushers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watched Buffalo's success with it, and when I was at
Cleveland in 1989 we used it the final month of the season,''
Trestman said.
</P>
<P>
   When he was quarterbacks coach at Detroit last season, Trestman
picked the brain of Lions backup Frank Reich. As Kelly's backup for
the Bills, Reich came into an AFC wild-card playoff game against
Houston in 1992 facing a 35-3 deficit. He rallied the Bills to the
greatest comeback in NFL playoff history, a 41-38 win in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank gave me insight,'' Trestman said. ``Their no-huddle was
different than what we're doing here in that they stayed in the
same personnel grouping. If we continue to do it, when we do it,
we'll move personnel around and force defenses to turn over their
personnel, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Trestman acknowledges the no-huddle could be an effective tool
in engaging his offense earlier in games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changes the pace and flow of the game,'' Trestman said.
``It creates somewhat of an uncomfortable environment for the
defense. They're changing quicker. They've got to be alert to
personnel changes. We're all creatures of habit. When you take a
player out of his normal environment, you could create that
uncomfortable sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we feel we can change the pace of the game with the
no-huddle, we will.'' &QL;

ARIZONA'S UNDERRATED SHIP COMES IN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON - Unknown in August. Undefeated in September. Unlikely
after a loss in October. Unbeaten since then.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Arizona, underrated until now.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats (10-1, 6-1 Pac-10 Conference) rank among college
football's biggest surprises. For evidence, you need look no
further than the national polls.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona started at No. 24 in the Associated Press preseason
poll. Today the Wildcats are No. 8, which, ironically, was Arizona
State's starting point.
</P>
<P>
   They've climbed 16 spots. Only No. 9 Arkansas has come further.
The Razorbacks weren't ranked at all in the hazy days of August.
</P>
<P>
   How did it happen?
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, not even Arizona Coach Dick Tomey, could have guessed
that his 1998 team would arrive at this week with a chance to
become the school's first to win 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp Cochise near Douglas, Tomey was searching for a few big
men. He talked about a committee approach to the defensive line. He
grew testy with skeptical questions about plans to use two
quarterbacks, Keith Smith and Ortege Jenkins. His leading running
back, Trung Canidate, didn't participate in camp because of an
injury.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Tomey walked off Cochise College's practice field,
looked at the faraway mountains and talked about the view's
``beautiful tapestry.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounded as if he were taking one last look at it all. His job
was on the line, and there were whispers about who would succeed
him. Mediocrity was predicted. The Wildcats figured to be a
crushing bore.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't, for a mix of reasons that includes luck,
unprecedented offensive creativity in the Tomey era, smarts at key
positions, gamesmanship and timing. In large part, the last of
those has made it all work. Except for 10 minutes at the end of a
55-28 loss to UCLA, Arizona's timing has been Swiss-clock perfect.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule is a key. If ASU's season-opening loss to
Washington was a knockout blow, Arizona's early games were tuneups
that allowed a talented young fighter to gain experience and
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats' first two games were on the road. But what a road.
This was college football's Club Med, with stops at Hawaii and
Stanford. But there were rocky moments.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii, still winless, actually threatened in the first half
before Arizona won, 27-6. A weak Stanford also made the Wildcats
look vulnerable in the early moments before succumbing, 31-14.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, each game provided hints of what was about to
happen. A sure sign of promise was the season's opening kickoff.
Chris McAlister returned it 100 yards for a touchdown. In a sense,
the Wildcats have never looked back since then.
</P>
<P>
   McAlister was one of the few certainties amid all the unknown.
The preseason All-American has lived up to the billing. In the
early games, Arizona was allowed to grow around the core of talent
that McAlister represents.
</P>
<P>
   With each game, it became evident that some of Arizona's skilled
offensive players had been either overlooked or forgotten. There
was Jeremy McDaniel, who didn't play last season because of
injuries and academic problems. He was almost impossible to stop in
the early going, and he is still one of Arizona's big-play artists.
He leads Pac-10 receivers in touchdowns with nine.
</P>
<P>
   By the time opponents remembered McDaniel was back, Dennis
Northcutt grew from a complementary receiver into a dangerous one
all unto himself. In addition to a spot among the league's top 10
receivers in total receptions and yardage, Northcutt is third in
the conference in all-purpose yardage with a 141.3 average.
</P>
<P>
   The Northcutt-McDaniel combi nation helped make a success of the
Smith-Jenkins rotation. They were consistently open for receptions,
regardless of who was throwing the pass. It could have been Ortege
Smith or Keith Jenkins, for all it mattered.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there was the emergence of a linebacker who caught
Tomey's attention at the end of last season's 7-5 finish. Then,
Marcus Bell had potential. In a 35-11 victory over Iowa on Sept.
19, he became a star with a jarring third-quarter hit of the
Hawkeyes quarterback. Today, Bell leads the Pac-10 in tackles with
10.7 a game.
</P>
<P>
   With McAlister in the secondary and Bell established at
linebacker, the evolution continued along the defensive front.
Tomey had known entities along the front in Daniel Greer and Joe
Tafoya. But during a defining 31-28 victory at Washington, he
discovered a player who had arrived in Tucson without credentials
as a high-profile prospect.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Keoni Fraser was playing high school football in
Hawaii. On Oct. 3 in Seattle, the freshman was made one defensive
stop after another in a gane that featured Jenkins' famous
game-winning flip into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Then and since, there have been Eli Wnek, Mike Robertson, Idris
Harroon and Ben Alualu. The committee is working beyond
expectations, if not belief. It was the key to six sacks, and
perhaps a 27-23 Arizona victory, last week at California.
</P>
<P>
   The flaw in Arizona's season has been the fourth-quarter
collapse against UCLA on Oct. 10. Yet, here again, there was good
timing. The Wildcats were able to recover the next Saturday at
Corvallis, Ore., with a 28-7 victory over a relatively weak Oregon
State.
</P>
<P>
   Then they were able to conduct midseason maneuvers against an
overmatched Northeast Louisiana. A 45-7 whipping over a former
Division II school was the perfect way to prepare for Oregon on
Halloween. The work paid off. Arizona was never better in a 38-3
whipping of the Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   The last piece in the puzzle was Canidate, the junior from
Central High School who left no doubt a stress fracture in his left
foot had finally healed.
</P>
<P>
   Canidate broke loose for a 71-yard touchdown run against Oregon.
Since then, he has scored on runs of 75, 45 and 54 yards. His 6.3
yards per carry leads the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Canidate's explosive emergence has made anything look possible.
In Arizona time, almost everything has been. &QL;

TEAM CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO DIAL WOLF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - There are weekends when they see each other on the
roof of Sun Devil Stadium. They might shake hands, they might share
a smile, but the conversation always starts and ends the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You in shape?'' Bob Ferguson, the personnel boss, asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Joe Wolf answers.
</P>
<P>
   And then Wolf, a Cardinal-in-waiting, an ex-employee who hasn't
lost the itch, spends another week waiting for the phone call that
never comes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're banking on their starters staying healthy,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Vision. It always comes back to vision.
</P>
<P>
   So here are the Cardinals, clinging to the final playoff spot,
hoping to keep their season afloat, on the road for the next two
weeks, sniffing the postseason for the first time since arriving in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   And here are the Cardinals, sitting on their hands, reacting
with crossed fingers and a tenuous wish that their depleted
offensive line can stay healthy for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it's been a long time, and the Cardinals may not fully
grasp what they're chasing. But this is not how to embrace a
playoff push.
</P>
<P>
   In the past six quarters, the much-maligned offensive line
finally has stood up to the criticism. In the past six quarters,
the offense has scored 50 points. Together, they have delivered
overdue compensation to their friends on defense.
</P>
<P>
   But now there are bumps in the road. Bumps threatening to expand
and swallow the bus.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Graham awoke with fluid in his left knee this week. Chris
Dishman is two weeks removed from a strained neck injury. Lomas
Brown is 35 years old. Lester Holmes has been inconsistent. James
Dexter is fine.
</P>
<P>
   They all will play today, and the coaching staff will pray for
the best. Because Anthony Clement, the rookie who could've made a
difference, is gone for the season. Because Matt Joyce, the first
backup at both tackle and guard, will miss at least two weeks with
a broken hand.
</P>
<P>
   One injury, and the postseason might rely on Jerome Daniels or
Mike Devlin or Jon Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Feel good about that?
</P>
<P>
   Last season in Dallas, Brown was injured during warm-ups. The
Cardinals turned to Wolf, who was more than adequate as a
substitute left tackle. In his NFL career, he has played every
position on the offensive line except center. He says he's in
shape, and after attending training camp in Flagstaff, he already
knows the framework of the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``All season, I've been lifting, running, the whole works,''
Wolf said. ``The only thing I'm missing is the contact. As for
learning the offense, it would take maybe two nights to look at.
We're not talking rocket science here.''
</P>
<P>
   But we are talking another dent in the payroll. A whopping
$120,000 for the rest of the season. For a team that is $3 million
under the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes it odd,'' Wolf said. ``If they weren't in
the running, like last year, you'd understand them playing the guys
they have to see if they can play or not. But when you're in a
playoff run for the first time ever in the Valley, you think they'd
do something. You think they'd want to be covered.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if one of the starters goes down, Wolf's phone will
be ringing off the hook. Or in the words of Vince Tobin, you don't
make decisions until you're forced to make decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Why not act now? Why not plan for disaster?
</P>
<P>
   Vision. It always comes back to vision.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins are on a roll, a Joe Nedney field goal removed from
a three-game winning streak, a team that has won its past two home
games by a combined score of 49-17. Beating the embarrassed Chiefs
in two weeks at Arrowhead Stadium is a tall order. And in three
weeks, a man who knows how to dismantle the Cardinals like no other
_ former assistant coach Jim Fassel _ brings the Giants to Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   This will not be easy. This is no time to just hope for the
best.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Wolf would cost $20,000 a game for the next six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals would rather throw pennies in a wishing well. &QL;

PEYTON'S PLACE: AMONG TOP ROOKIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Peyton Manning still makes silly mistakes that a $48 million
quarterback can't make.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Indianapolis Colts rookie has thrown 20
interceptions, an NFL high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say to myself, `I can't throw that again. I can't throw that
pass that late,' '' Manning said.
</P>
<P>
   He has become a good listener.
</P>
<P>
   Ten games into the season, Manning, the first pick overall in
the 1998 draft, already has tied a league rookie record with
touchdown passes in seven consecutive games. He has thrown for 11
scores in the past five games.
</P>
<P>
   Manning, the 6-foot-5, 230-pounder from Tennessee, holds team
rookie records for completions (209) and yards (2,289) and is on
pace to finish with 3,662 yards, which would be an NFL rookie mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything you've heard about the guy, his work ethic, his
character, his intelligence, his ability, his leadership . . . he's
better than you heard,'' Coach  &UR; Jim Mora said. ``He reminds me of a
throwback guy. No ego. Tough. Wants to win. Competes. If you put a
pair of black high-top football shoes on him like  &UR; Johnny Unitas
used to wear, he'd look pretty comfortable in them.''
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Manning threw three touchdown passes and drove the
Colts 80 yards in the final minutes to beat the New York Jets,
24-23.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the Colts' second victory, but it signaled Manning's
coming of age.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems a lot more relaxed, confident, poised and calm,
especially in critical situations,'' Mora said. ``He has that
mental and emotional makeup that serves him well in tough
situations. I think this will be a big boost for his confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, San Diego Chargers rookie quarterback  &UR; Ryan Leaf sits
on the bench, demoted for his two touchdowns and 13 interceptions
and his behavior off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Manning, who has 15 touchdown passes, doesn't think sitting and
watching would have served any purpose for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the best way to learn is to make mistakes,'' he
said. ``You come into the league with high expectations of how fast
defenses are, how complex defenses are. But you have to face live
bullets to find out just how fast the free safety is, that you put
too much arm on that pass to get it by him. You say to yourself,
`You can't float the ball. Drive that ball.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it can be tough, and (losing) is all new to me. I was
34-5 in three years as a starter in high school. I lost only six in
college. I had a lot of negative experiences early this season.
Sometimes it can get you down. Your confidence could get down, and
you never get over it. But I've just kept working and believing
that good things would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   How much has Manning improved? He has learned to get rid of the
ball and has been sacked only twice in the past six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The games started off at 100 mph for me,'' he said. ``Now it's
about 75 mph.  &UR; Steve Young,
 &UR; Brett Favre, John Elway are probably at 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to play. That's the only way you get better. I'm not
using this year as a crutch or a waiting period to get to next
year.'' &QL; 
Silent protest &QL; 
``Cincinnati Enquirer'' columnist  &UR; Paul Daugherty has a suggestion
for frustrated Bengals fans, tired of having the AFC's worst record
in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   He said fans should take their protest beyond renting a
helicopter to fly over the practice field and asking for the
dismissal of team owner  &UR; Mike Brown, Coach  &UR; Bruce Coslet and
offensive coordinator  &UR; Ken Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Daugherty suggested that the fans boycott today's game between
the Bengals (2-8) and the Baltimore Ravens (3-7).
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an inarguable sanity to it,'' Daugherty wrote. ``It's
the same sanity that says if you don't want a headache, then stop
banging your head against the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile,  &UR; Paul Justin, the former Arizona State and Rattlers
player, will be the team's fourth starter at quarterback in the
past 17 games.
</P>
<P>
   Justin, 30, has leapfrogged from third string to first past
 &UR; Neil O'Donnell and  &UR; Jeff Blake.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've shown up to this point, most of the time, is not
the Cincinnati Bengals,'' Justin said. ``Hopefully, we can turn it
around this week. But I don't put any extra pressure on me. I
learned a long time ago it doesn't do any good.'' &QL; 
Memories linger &QL; 
The Patriots are moving out of the worst stadium in the NFL,
Foxboro Stadium, formerly known as Schaefer Stadium and Sullivan
Stadium, to a $350 million facility in Hartford, Conn., in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping that the first time it snows there, the Patriots
don't find an ex-con to climb aboard a snowplow and clear the way
for a game-winning field goal try.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what happens at Foxboro Stadium the next two
seasons, the place always will be known for  &UR; Mark Henderson, on
leave from prison, driving his snowplow onto the field 15 years ago
to give kicker  &UR; John Smith a better chance to beat the Dolphins,
3-0.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, former Dolphins Coach  &UR; Don Shula won't refer to
then-Patriots Coach  &UR; Ron Meyer by name because of that play.
</P>
<P>
   Shula remembers another game in Foxboro for the ``funny smell''
in the room where he held his post-game news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured it was turpentine or paint thinner,'' Shula said.
``They had us in a broom closet for the press conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Just two years ago, the lights went out as  &UR; Adam Vinatieri was
about to kick a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was right before we kicked,'' Vinatieri said. ``I had taken
my steps back and everything. I gave (holder  &UR; Tom Tupa) the nod,
and Tom turned and was set to say, `Set,' and bam, the lights went
out. Fifteen minutes went by. I went to the sideline, put my jacket
on and everything. It was weird.'' &QL; 
Breakout game? &QL; 
When Minnesota beat Green Bay earlier this season, Vikings rookie
 &UR; Randy Moss had five catches for 190 yards and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   But in the next four weeks, he had only 10 receptions for 136
yards and no scores.
</P>
<P>
   He rebounded to catch four passes for 99 yards and a score in
last week's victory over the Bengals. In fact, he celebrated the
touchdown by leaping so high into the stands that his knees wound
up on top of the restraining wall at the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's nothing,'' said Moss, who will renew his rivalry with
the Packers today at Minneapolis. ``That's all expected.''
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't found too many NFL defensive backs he respects.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Bengals secondary, Moss said, ``They didn't do
nothing. It's the same week after week. . . . They were poor, as
usual.'' &QL;

SANTA MONICA SEES SEVENTH SLAYING IN SIX WEEKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- A man was shot to death on a street near
a Santa Monica park early Saturday morning, marking the city's
seventh homicide in six weeks, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gary Gallinot of the Santa Monica Police Department said the
victim, who appeared to be in his mid-30s, still hasn't been
identified. He was shot once in the torso at 2:15 a.m. and died at
the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Gallinot said another man, 36-year-old Terry Holt, was seen by
witnesses fleeing from a car that police saw speeding away from the
crime scene. Holt was questioned by police and later arrested on a
no-bail parole violation unrelated to the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Gallinot said the latest shooting doesn't appear to be related
to any of the six other killings. Investigators also said the
shooting did not appear to be gang-related.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate we've had so much at one time,'' Gallinot
said. ``We're actively pursuing each and every one of these
investigations. We're doing everything we can to apprehend the
responsible parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said Saturday's shooting occurred in the 2000 block of
Virginia Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   A Santa Monica police officer was patrolling Virginia Avenue
Park when he heard gunshots. The officer pursued a car speeding
away from the scene, and a man found near the vehicle was detained
for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Gallinot said police don't know if the man was involved in the
shooting and aren't sure what the motive was.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Monica recorded only one homicide in 1997. At least four
of the slayings this year are believed to be gang-related.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, crime is at the lowest level it's been since the
1960s in Santa Monica,'' Gallinot said. ``However, we have seen
seven homicides in the last six weeks. We live in an urbanized
society surrounded by one of the largest metropolitan areas in the
country. Crime does occur.''
</P>
<P>
   The killing spree began Oct. 12 when Omar Sevilla, a 22-year-old
gang member from suburban Culver City, was shot. About two hours
later, Horst Fietze, a German tourist on vacation with his wife,
was killed during a street holdup.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, gang member Juan Campos, 28, was shot to death
in a Santa Monica liquor store.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 27, Michael Juarez, 27, and his brother Anthony, 18 from
San Luis Obispo County to the north, were killed at a clothing
store their cousin, a former Santa Monica gang member, had recently
opened.
</P>
<P>
   And on Nov. 1, police arrested a transient suspected of killing
another transient, Jim Henders, 28, on the beach near Ocean Park
Boulevard.

WASHINGTON GAMES PROVING GROUNDS FOR UA, ASU

<P>
   PHOENIX - A flip and a strip.
</P>
<P>
   Although both plays took a matter of seconds, they made dramatic
impacts on the direction of Arizona's and Arizona State's seasons.
And both were game-ending plays against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   One worked, one didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats vaulted into the national spotlight with Ortege
Jenkins' game-winning flip into the end zone at Seattle's Husky
Stadium on Oct. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils fell out of the national championship race when
Huskies quarterback Brock Huard hit tight end Reggie Davis with a
63-yard game-winning pass with 28 seconds remaining in the season
opener.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Mitchell Freedman, who had been one of ASU's most
reliable defensive players, tried to strip the ball from Davis _
who had gotten past Phillip Brown _ instead of tackling him and
possibly holding Washington to a field goal. He failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loss wasn't the absolute difference in our season,'' ASU
Coach Bruce Snyder said, ``but I think it may have impacted how the
team subsequently handled itself in big game situations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats-Huskies game will be remembered for one play that
Arizona Coach Dick Tomey says has defined his team.
</P>
<P>
   Before kickoff, Arizona had a 4-0 record that was built on a
soft start to a 12-game schedule. Tomey wasn't certain about his
team. Was it tough enough?
</P>
<P>
   Tomey learned it was with Jenkins' heroic play and all the big
ones that preceded his somersault.
</P>
<P>
   ``The turning point came with the mind-set we showed at
Washington,'' Tomey said. ``OJ's play was the key, but we showed
real persistence throughout that game. There were injuries. We gave
up a touchdown off a fumble within the opening minute. But we kept
coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins' acrobatic move has been played and replayed. The
Highlight Hall of Fame is the next stop.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the play is described as a 9-yard run with four
seconds left in a 31-28 Arizona victory. But the numbers do a
disservice. It was so much more in so many different ways.
</P>
<P>
   First, the play itself:
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins took the snap and dropped back to about the 20-yard
line. He looked for receiver Dennis Northcutt or tight end Mike
Lucky. Both were covered. Jenkins then took off. He ran straight
ahead and, at about the 4-yard line, leaped head over heels. It
appeared that three Washington defenders tipped his feet just
enough to allow him to do a full 360-degree flip. He landed like
that other Tucson gymnast, Kerri Strug.
</P>
<P>
   If he hadn't landed in the end zone, Jenkins could have
continued running. That's how good his balance was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used my basketball skills to jump over those guys,'' said
Jenkins, a reserve guard on the Wildcats 1997 national championship
team.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a 55-28 loss to UCLA, the No. 8 Wildcats have been
jumping up the national polls ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ASU's heartbreaking defeat seemed to sap the life out of the Sun
Devils.
</P>
<P>
   They looked flat in the following week's 26-6 loss at Brigham
Young and unimpressive in a win over North Texas on Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder noticed right away something was wrong with his team
after the Washington defeat at Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not overcome the hangover until midweek,'' he said.
``It's the bounce in their step. I can taste it, smell it. And it's
not the third-string guys. It's the ``players.''''
</P>
<P>
   ASU dropped from No. 6 to 14 in the Associated Press poll after
the game. It wouldn't be long before they were out of the polls for
good.
</P>
<P>
   It was a heartbreaking defeat because the offense had clicked
against Washington. Quarterback Ryan Kealy passed for 302 yards and
three touchdowns and didn't throw an interception. In many ways,
the Sun Devils outplayed the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   Until the end. &QL;

Late miscue bursts Rice's bubble
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By NEAL FARMER &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. _ For the third time in three years, the
Rice Owls were poised on the precipice, playing in a game with
championship implications in November. Win and they are in; lose
and they fall out of consideration.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the other key games in 1996 (a 49-0 loss at BYU) and
1997 (a 31-14 loss at Utah), the Owls had Saturday's game at No. 20
Air Force in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Rice held a two-point lead with less than nine minutes remaining
and long-suffering Rice fans were starting to become wide-eyed with
anticipation. But Air Force linebacker Mike Tyler stepped in front
of a Chad Richardson pass, ran down the left sideline and scored on
a 26-yard interception return with 8:27 left. The run for PAT was
successful and Air Force held on for a 22-16 victory before 47,647
at Falcon Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler had torn the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee
this year and must have surgery after the season. He also had
hyperextended the knee two series before his game-deciding play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to beg the trainers to let me back in the game,'' Tyler
said. ``I knew somebody had to make a big play for us. It's been
that way all season, and I guess it was my turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyler and safety Charlton Warren thought a slant pass to wide
receiver Jason Blackwell was coming _ which had been successful in
the first quarter _ and faked a blitz before dropping into
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force won the Western Athletic Conference Mountain Division
by beating Rice, and will play Pacific Division champion BYU on
Dec. 5 in Las Vegas in the WAC Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   To add insult to injury, the Owls would have gone to the WAC
title game with a win because Tulsa upset Wyoming 35-0, which would
have given Rice the necessary tiebreakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a kick in the gut to hear that (Tulsa) score,''
said Rice offensive guard Charles Torello.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force coach Fisher DeBerry said he used film as motivation
to get his team ready for the Owls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I showed our team a movie (Saturday) morning,'' DeBerry said.
``It was the league's advertisement for the WAC playoff game. And
Air Force wasn't even in it. So that shows you nobody in the WAC
expected us to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice players were philosophical abou tthe outcome, refusing to
blame anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hold Chad accountable for us losing the game,''
Torello said. ``We had numerous opportunities to win the game. It
wasn't Chad Richardson's fault. I firmly believe that. We didn't
take care of business so there is nothing we can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The game started well for Rice, as the Owls took the opening
kickoff and drove 76 yards on 16 plays before fullback Jamie Tyler
scored on a fourth-and-one for a 7-0 lead. The drive took 9:15,
which was the longest drive for Rice in coach Ken Hatfield's five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Rice held Air Force on its initial possession, one in which
quarterback Blane Morgan suffered a left ankle injury. Doctors said
he suffered a third-degree medial sprain and is doubtful for the
Dec. 5 game. Backup Cale Bonds replaced Morgan and struggled at
first.
</P>
<P>
   On their second series, the Owls drove from their 20 to the Air
Force 12 before Derek Crabtree kicked a 27-yard field goal for a
10-0 lead to silence the Air Force crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But the Falcons changed the tenor of the game, as they drove 93
yards on 18 plays to score on a one-yard run by fullback Spanky
Gillam to draw to within 10-7 with 1:08 remaining in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force took the lead in the third quarter on a four-yard
touchdown run by Bonds. The 11-play drive was aided by a 15-yard
roughing-the-passer penalty on Rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was a (bad) call,'' Rice linebacker Rashad
Reynolds said. ``But they capitalized off of it. Bonds also did
well. Morgan was out, but they still had the same blockers in
there, and I thought their blockers did a great job. Bonds kept his
poise and stayed in the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice trimmed the deficit to 14-13 on a 40-yard field goal by
Crabtree.
</P>
<P>
   Owls defensive back LonDee Smith then intercepted a Bonds pass
at the Rice 48 to stop an Air Force drive. Rice capitalized by
driving to the Falcons' 23 before Crabtree added a career-long
41-yard field goal for a 16-14 lead with 12:19 remaining in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Tyler's subsequent interception brought a painful end
to the Owls' season.
</P>
<P>
   Rice had other opportunities in the game, as Richardson
overthrew a wide-open Leroy Bradley streaking down the right
sideline, and cornerback Adrian Sadler dropped a would-be
interception that hit him in the hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been that kind of year,'' said Hatfield of his Owls
(5-6). ``Nobody gave us a chance; we were 21-point underdogs
against Air Force. We took the opening drive and scored. We did
some things. But we made one bad play to let them back in there.
</P>
<P>
   ``But without Chad's throwing early, we wouldn't have been where
we were. We've been one play away all year long _ except for the
Texas game _ but no team plays harder than us. No one. It's just
been that kind of year.''
