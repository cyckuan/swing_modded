   KOSOVO-INTELLIGENCE (Washington) _ From the grainy airborne
reconnaissance photographs of downtown Belgrade that NATO military
planners use to identify bombing targets, the Chinese Embassy and a
headquarters for a Yugoslav arms agency nearby situated nearby look
very similar: same size, shape and height. But at street level,
there is no mistaking the embassy's marble structure with blue
mirrored glass, flying the distinctive Chinese flag, from the
Yugoslav military's white office building across the other side of
a major thoroughfare, Lenjinov Bulevar. By Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-CHINA-ASSESS (Beijing) _ Through their extended campaign
to portray the United States and NATO as evil aggressors in
Yugoslavia, and now their endorsement of mass demonstrations,
China's leaders may have unleashed forces that will come back to
haunt them. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-SERBIA (Podujevo, Serbia) _ Three months ago, Milos Savic
was frantic. He had been stopped at a checkpoint by the Kosovo
Liberation Army close to this northern Kosovo city and dragged out
of his car at gunpoint. The fear took him over, he said, and he
lost nearly 40 pounds. Today, Savic says he's feeling much better,
even as NATO airplanes bomb in the hills to the west. The KLA
checkpoints that began less then a mile from the city center are
gone, pushed back by the Serb offensive. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-KLA-LEADER (Tirana, Albania) _ Hundreds of thousands of
uprooted ethnic Albanians are huddled in woods and fields inside
Kosovo under the protection of Kosovo Liberation Army fighters,
Hashim Thaci, prime minister of the rebel provisional government
said in a telephone interview Sunday from inside the embattled
province. `'The food supply is running very low, the medical care
is minimal and hygenic conditions are very bad,'' Thaci said. ``We
have the first signs of epidemics of various diseases among the
children.'' By John Kifner.
</P>
<P>
   REFUGEES-FAMILY (New York) _ After six terrifying weeks spent
fleeing war at home in Kosovo, Sytkije Deva and her family had
finally arrived at Kennedy International Airport late Saturday
night. When it came time to leave, Mrs. Deva, 67, looking frail and
bewildered, asked her sister Lili Erbeli whether they were going to
a refugee camp next. Mrs. Erbeli took her eldest sister's hand and
broke the good news in rapid-fire Albanian. ``You're coming home
with me,'' she said. Then Mrs. Erbeli, 55, and her husband, Rex,
59, brought home to their 3-bedroom duplex 14 of their Kosovo kin _
undoubtedly among the world's luckiest exiles of war. By Somini
Sengupta.
</P>
<P>
   EXCLUSIVE-U.S.-CHINA-SPYING (Washington) _ A 1997 case involving
a Taiwanese-American scientist working on a classified Pentagon
project demonstrates that the U.S. government knew that China
successfully engaged in espionage during President Clinton's second
term. By Jeff Gerth and James Risen.
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-ELECTION (Soweto) _ In a country with a jobless rate
that may be as high as 40 percent and a crime rate that includes
140 murders or attempted murders a day, unemployment and safety are
the issues that top the agenda for most South Africans. But with
only four weeks to go before this country's second post apartheid
elections, corruption is emerging as a key issue too. By Suzanne
Daley.
</P>
<P>
   ARGENTINA-ISRAELI-EMBASSY (Bueno Aires) _ In a new twist in the
investigation of the 1992 bombing of the Israeli embassy that left
29 people dead, a tape recording of a police radio call has
suddenly emerged suggesting that officials purposely removed guards
from the facility three minutes before the blast. By Clifford
Krauss.

Revkin.

</P>
<P>
   MEDICARE-PRESCRIPTIONS _ Prescription drugs were not much of an
issue when Medicare was created in 1965, and thus not included as a
benefit. But 30 years later medicine has been transformed by
expensive new drugs to treat the ills of old age, leaving millions
of the elderly struggling to pay the bill, and creating a struggle
on Capitol Hill over coverage for outpatient drugs. By Robin Toner.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-CIVIL-RIGHTS _ In a sign of the ways that both Congress
and the leading civil rights groups have changed, the big civil
rights battles now are not about affirmative action or school
choice, but about access to bankruptcy courts and bank loans. By
Stephen Labaton.
</P>
<P>
   YOUTH-VIOLENCE-CONFERENCE _ In a search for a meaningful public
response to yet another outbreak of schoolhouse violence, President
Clinton will convene a White House meeting on Monday to address the
causes of violence by teenagers. But behind the White House summit
is the president's fabled political realism and a desire not to
alienate two powerful groups with broad political influence and
very deep pockets: the NRA and Hollywood. By John M. Broder and
Katharine Q. Seelye.

</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD-LOST-JOBS (LOS ANGELES) _ Seamstresses, steel workers
and electronics assemblers have all lost jobs as manufacturing
moved from the United States to countries where costs were lower.
Now complaints about similar job losses are coming from workers in
a quintessentially American industry: Hollywood's film and
television studios. By Andrew Pollack.

<P>
   MICROSOFT-TV-ANALYSIS (Undated) _ Has Bill Gates become the
Captain Ahab of the information age? Gates' white whale remains an
elusive digital set-top cable box that his company, Microsoft

   EBAY-CEO (San Jose, Calif.) _ Meg Whitman, chief executive of
the Internet auction company E-Bay, is one of the new generation of
Internet executives who is bringing conventional corporate bona

start-up technology companies have pushed forward with plans to
make electronic books as ubiquitous as mass market paperbacks. But
the culture of technology has collided with the slower-moving book
industry, which is engaged in a tense, early clash over how to
divide up the spoils of an infant business that is still difficult

IRVING STEVENS, 88, EX-HOBO, AUTHOR, INVENTOR OF FLY DOPE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine, Mass., Fla.)  (mk) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Irving ``Fishbones'' Stevens, who became a folk hero in Maine
for his tales of hobo life in the 1930s and his success developing
a foul-smelling insect repellent called Irving's Fly Dope, died at
the home of his sister, Dorothy Glazier, in Pittsfield, Maine, last
Tuesday. He was 88 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who was born on June 21, 1910, in Surry, Maine, and
lived in Corinna, Maine, picked up the nickname Fishbones as a
youth, when he was poor and hungry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was as thin as a rail,'' Ms. Glazier said. ``So, everyone
called him `Fishbones.' You could see every bone in his body.''
</P>
<P>
   As many down-and-out men did during the Great Depression,
Stevens hit the road, becoming what was then known as a hobo. When
World War II started, he joined the Air Force and served as a
private. After the war, he never returned to the hobo life.
Instead, he became a machinist in Maine and Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '60s, Stevens, always a tinkerer, developed
Irving's Fly Dope by heating pine tar and adding a few secret
ingredients. The concoction, which he bottled himself and sold
throughout New England, from a car, was as effective as it was
rank, and it remained a staple of campers and fishermen during
black-fly season until 1991, when environmental licensing fees made
it too expensive to produce.
</P>
<P>
   For some men, being the creator of Irving's Fly Dope might have
been enough fame for one life, but in the 1980s, Stevens
self-published ``Fishbones: Hoboing in the 1930s,'' a collection of
stories about his hobo years. The book became something of a local
sensation.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens wrote two more books, ``Mandy's Washtub and Other
Stories'' in 1992 and ``National King of the Hobos'' in 1997. He
was given the ceremonial title King of the Hobos in 1988, at the
annual National Hobo Convention in Britt, Iowa. Five years later,
he crowned one of his daughters, Constance Hall of Dexter, Maine,
as Queen of the Hobos.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Ms. Glazier and Ms. Hall, Stevens is survived by
another sister, Sidney Hanscom of West Palm Beach, Fla.; three
sons, James Stevens of Stetons, Maine, Richard Russell of
Worcester, Mass., and Philip Batchelder of Abbot, Maine; two other
daughters, Brenda Hall of St. Albans, Maine, and Marybeth Cribbs of
Waterville, Maine, and 13 grandchildren.

BOMBING ADDS NEW STRAINS TO ALREADY TENSE TIES BETWEEN U.S. AND
CHINA
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Subs lede for updating)  (rk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Chinese government Sunday night suspended
high-level military ties and a new human rights dialogue with the
United States in response to the mistaken NATO bombing of its
embassy in Belgrade last week.
</P>
<P>
   Talks on arms control, international security and preventing
arms proliferation were also being postponed, the official New
China News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by Beijing seemed intended to signal China's
displeasure without disrupting the main elements of its battered
relationship with Washington. But the bomb attack has already
proven its potential to do far greater harm to ties with Beijing
than to frustrate any peace settlement for Kosovo, administration
officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The accidental bombing by NATO _ which is being portrayed in
China as deliberate _ played to one of China's historical
sensitivities: humiliation at the hands of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   With no let-up Sunday in street demonstrations in Beijing
against the United States, the administration scrambled to try and
persuade the Chinese that it regretted the loss of lives.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that the embassy bombing may strengthen the hands of
conservatives in Beijing's secretive leadership, administration
officials also emphasized the continuing desire for a ``strategic
partnership'' with China, a relationship already badly frayed over
allegations of espionage, and issues of human rights and trade.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton sent a 1 1/2-page letter to China's President
Jiang Zemin Sunday that expressed condolences and set out NATO's
cause against Yugoslavia, a White House spokesman said. The letter
concluded by saying the president would continue to work on
improving the relationship between the two countries, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   To date, however, China has resolutely opposed NATO's bombing,
and its controlled media have not reported on the plight of
Kosovo's Albanians, but rather on the suffering of Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Around midnight on Saturday, Secretary of State, Madeleine
Albright, accompanied by the under secretary of state, Thomas
Pickering, went to the Chinese Embassy to speak with Ambassador Li
Zhaoxing to express sorrow at the accident, a State Department
spokesman said. The secretary, he said, explained to the ambassador
that the accident was an ``intelligence failure.''
</P>
<P>
   How much effect the late-night visit had was not clear.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on the ABC television program ``This Week'' Sunday, Li
declared that the bombing was a ``horrifying atrocity, something
rarely seen in the entire history of the worst diplomacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Li said the Chinese government was demanding an investigation of
the bombing by NATO and after the results of the inquiry would
determine what ``further actions'' to take.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from the embassy in Beijing on the CBS News program
``Face the Nation,'' America's ambassador to China, James Sasser,
said the Chinese government was tolerating or even encouraging the
street demonstrations in Beijing, which he called a risky policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a sense of widespread indignation within officialdom
itself here about this tragic bombing of the Chinese Embassy,'' he
said, even as the demonstrations continued outside his compound.
``This is, I think, really a national thought to some extent, and
one of our more perceptive foreign service officers here today
said, perhaps the Chinese want us to feel their pain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major complicating factor in the United States-China
relationship,'' a senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   It was probably inevitable, he said, that the bombing would be
exploited by the conservative elements in the Beijing government
who have been against the more modernizing trends led by Jiang and
Prime Minister Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the official said, the administration's
policy of working toward a ``strategic partnership'' with China may
have shown some dividends in the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
   With personal contacts established between Clinton and Jiang
during their visits to each other's countries in the last two
years, it was slightly harder for the Chinese to return immediately
to the mentality of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   But the pressures on the more Western-leaning officials,
particularly as China faces the 10th anniversary next month of the
killing of hundreds of civilians by the military at the Tiananmen
demonstrations, would only mount in the wake of the Belgrade
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a debate in China mirroring that in the United
States in which the military and the hard-liners have accused Prime
Minister Zhu of being too soft,'' said Winston Lord, a former
American ambassador to China. ``There is the danger that in the
coming weeks that those who want to be constructive will be on the
defensive. This is going to give ammunition to the hard-liners.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While China, as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council,
is needed for any U.N.-brokered resolution of the Kosovo war, the
most immediate long-term issue at stake for Washington is China's
entry into the World Trade Organization, the Geneva-based body
which governs world commerce. China's admission has been going
through a rocky phase after the visit of Zhu to Washington last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu, who came to the United States with far more concessions on
market openings in China than the administration expected, was
aggrieved when Clinton failed to sign onto an agreement that would
have paved the way for China's entry.
</P>
<P>
   But just before Zhu left the United States, Clinton backtracked
somewhat, telephoning the prime minister with a pledge that the
United States would back China's membership in the trade
organization as long China stood by the major concessions on
foreign investment in telecommunications, banking and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   By last week, however, those concessions had been withdrawn,
apparently the victim of Chinese government officials who believed
Zhu had given away too much to the West. With anti-Americanism now
raging in the Chinese media and on the streets of Beijing, these
conservative officials could well prevail, a Clinton administration
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the bombing of the embassy, the next three weeks
are critical in the World Trade Organization process. Clinton faces
a June 3 deadline for telling Congress whether he intends to renew
China's trading status. If China becomes a member of the trade
body, Congress would have to normalize China's trading status, a
move that is set to spark a major political brawl for the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of human rights, the administration infuriated
Beijing by filing a resolution condemning China's practices at the
annual meeting of the United Nations this spring in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of a number of arrests and imprisonments of
political dissidents late last year and earlier this year, the
recent State Department annual report on human rights around the
world was particularly critical of China.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship has also soured over allegations from the U.S.
intelligence agencies that China posed an ``acute intelligence
threat'' to nuclear weapons laboratories. A computer scientist at
Los Alamos National Laboratory has been fired under suspicion of
stealing nuclear design secrets for China, although he has not been
charged.

   LOS ANGELES _ All Kurt Rambis should have to do at this point in

   Aside from L.A.'s seemingly vested interest, isn't the best
reason not to add a 32nd team to the NFL is because it'll water
down a product that seems to be hydroplaning quite well on its own
at this point?
</P>
<P>
   When it gets to 40, sell....
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Bears offensive coordinator Gary Crownton said it about
6-foot-1 rookie QB Cade McNown, who some believe is too short to
play in the NFL: ``He's about the size of a lot of guys that
size.''...
</P>
<P>
   Before they drafted McNown, da Bears were all set to sign free
agent Todd Marinovich. Lookin' around, Toddie's next bet might
be... L.A.'s new arena team?...
</P>
<P>
   Further proof Gifferoo will !ital!never live this down, the
cover of the June issue of McCall's is ``A frank talk with Kathie
Lee: How she's survived the ultimate betrayal.''...
</P>
<P>
   Fox's Howie Long made it into People magazine's issue of ``The
50 Most Beautiful People In the World 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Foxes Catherine Zeta-Jones, Ashley Judd, Katie Holmes, Charlize
Theron, Rebecca Gayheart, Tyra Banks (and the rest of Victoria
Secret's spring '99 catalog, for that matter), Cameron Diaz, Daisy
Fuentes, Salma Hayek, Alyssa Milano, Kate Moss, Denise Richards,
Jenna Jameson, Courteney Cox, Courtney Love _ not, Ali Landry (she
flips for Doritos in the commercial), Heather Graham, Heather
Locklear, Heather Thomas, the cast of ``Heathers,'' Bridget Fonda,
Bridget Hall, Halle Berry, Gretchen Mol, Angelina Jolie, Milla
Jovovich, Rachel Weisz, Jacinda Barrett (remember the Aussie from
``The Real World'' London cast?), Jennifer Esposito, Kari Wuhrer,
Natasha Henstridge, Caprice (no last name necessary), Vanessa
Williams, Donna D'Errico, Gena Lee Nolin, Yasmine Bleeth, Pamela
Anderson (with or without her talent), anyone else from
``Baywatch,'' Sophie Marceau, Sara Michelle Gellar, Sarah O'Hare
(see the sandcastle lady in SI '99 swimsuit issue with Heidi Klum),
Sandra Bernhard (not really, just seeing if you're paying attention
this far), Daniela Pestova, Famke Janssen, Shania Twain (as long as
she's not singing), two of the three Dixie Chicks, three of the
four from The Corrs (not the guy), Laura Prepon, Elizabeth Hurley,
Marci Brickhouse (she keeps tackling Aikman in the Brut
commercial), Jeanette Lee (aka, ``The Black Widow''), Rena Mero
(Sable from the WWF), Lucy Lawless (who'd take Sable easily), Lara
Croft (c'mon, Tomb Raider III!),... heck, even Jennifer Love
Hewitt... and did we mention Catherine Zeta-Jones... And we even
left out Anna Kournikova, Drew Barrymore, Reese Witherspoon, Neve
Campbell, Kathy Ireland...
</P>
<P>
   So there's at least 50 who coulda started their own firestorm
ahead of Howie. Analyze that, flathead. &QL;

L.A.'S TV STOPS EVERYTHING TO COVER FREEWAY FUGITIVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A horrific tornado hit Oklahoma, a deranged
motorist slammed into a day-care center, bombs fell on Belgrade,
but in Los Angeles the big story of the day, live on television,
was another freeway car chase.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, on this particular day, it was a slow-speed pursuit of
a lumbering, renegade motor home that news helicopters beamed to
millions of homes across Southern California for more than three
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a journalist, the chase wasn't a real significant story,''
said Jeff Wald, news director for KTLA-TV, the WB affiliate. ``But
our industry is viewer-driven, and every time there's a chase,
people tune in. It's all about what our viewers want.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Los Angeles, home of the televised car chase, a
cultural event that unfailingly draws crowds around TVs, as
everyone waits for a crash or _ even better _ a shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Ratings are the name of the game in the entertainment capital of
the world. And nothing gets viewer numbers quite like a freeway
chase.
</P>
<P>
   Police say freeway chases are on the rise, in great part because
these live broadcasts encourage people to run from officers to get
on television.
</P>
<P>
   Behavioral experts say this growing appetite for chases reflects
humanity's worst side, as viewers turn off sitcoms and soap operas
in the hopes of seeing a real-life drama unfold right before their
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When these pursuits come on, people say, `Oh gosh, not another
one,' but then they will sit there and watch for two to three
hours,'' said Dr. Bruce Gross, a criminal behavior expert at the
University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a morbid curiosity to see how they end _ if they have
to kill the guy or someone gets hurt or a major situation arises.
That's just the way society is, and it can be a real problem.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the man in the motor home pointed a handgun at
police and died in a barrage of bullets.
</P>
<P>
   KTLA and other stations had already dropped live coverage when
the chase became a standoff, Wald said. But ground crews kept the
tapes rolling, capturing the bloodshed for the morning news.
</P>
<P>
   It was the ultimate payoff for those who had watched.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, about 1.2 million viewers tuned to KTLA alone for the
drama, as compared to the average 700,000 that normally watch
during that period, Wald said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say TV performs a public disservice by airing the
chases. The ``glorification'' of police pursuits could even
encourage some to run, Gross said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is contempt for police or a person is trying to make
some kind of statement by tying up the roadways and the airwaves,
then televised pursuits could encourage that activity,'' Gross
said.
</P>
<P>
   TV stations only once _ and only briefly _ reconsidered their
aggressive drive to broadcast all chases to the very end.
</P>
<P>
   A distraught Long Beach, Calif., man shot himself in the head
April 30, 1998, as a million horrified television viewers
witnessed, including children who tuned in for afternoon cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Jones, 40, had stopped his pickup truck on an overpass
between the Harbor and Century freeways, then he unfurled a banner
and set himself, his dog and the truck on fire. He bolted out of
the burning truck and removed his flaming trousers.
</P>
<P>
   Then he shot himself to death.
</P>
<P>
   The shock and outrage by the on-air death provoked criticism
from many viewers and prompted TV stations to use a time delay for
broadcasting chases so they wouldn't get caught airing another
death.
</P>
<P>
   That lasted only a week or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viewers are driven by the thought that something bad will
happen _ that there will be a bloody payoff for watching _ and the
stations take advantage of that for ratings,'' said Cynthia
Rawitch, chairwoman of the journalism department at California
State University, Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``TV stations do not do a public service broadcasting these
chases, like they claim,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Behavior specialist David W. Stewart at USC blames the media for
creating an appetite for pursuits, but he said the attraction will
decline over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people in Los Angeles are awfully bored, and there's a
certain level of excitement created by pursuits because we want to
see how they end,'' Stewart said. ``But the recent excitement has
been created by the media. Car chases have been around as long as
there have been cars.''
</P>
<P>
   At a local Fry's Electronics store, when a chase flashes on the
wall of televisions for sale, the result is predictable: a crowd
quickly gathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a natural reaction. People will stop and watch,''
said salesman Rene Suguitan.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Bustos, 33, said he watches chases for excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's happening live and you want to see what happens,'' said
Bustos. ``It shows you how crazy some people can be, and how the
cops deal with it. It's kind of cool.''

LOS ANGELES: kind of cool.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps the most remembered chase of all time, ironically, is
known for its slow speed _ O.J. Simpson's snail-paced return to his
Brentwood home in June 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the Simpson chase cemented televised police chases
as the new pop drama and became as much a part of Los Angeles
culture as In-N-Out Burgers.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a new phenomenon, however.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, the first ``telecopter'' hit the skies to take
weather shots, and soon after they were capturing crime scenes and
chases.
</P>
<P>
   The Rodney King beating and the Los Angeles riots further fed
broadcasters' obsession with live shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unusual for a reporter to be standing in an empty
parking lot at 11 p.m. doing a live report where something happened
15 hours earlier,'' said Rick Marks, a CSUN journalism professor
who spent 23 years as a news producer with NBC and its Los Angeles
affiliate, KNBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all consultant-driven. There's an idea that ratings will
jump if you can trick viewers into thinking that something is
happening live.''
</P>
<P>
   Wald defends the coverage of pursuits as a public service.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ultimate hope as a journalist is to show our viewers that
the bad guys don't get away, so there's no rational sense to run,''
Wald said. ``We want to deter people from getting involved in
them.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the chicken-and-egg debate over who has the blood lust,
the media or the viewers, Wald said it's definitely the viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask anyone if they watch public television, and they'll tell
you yes, even though they really don't,'' Wald said. ``Then ask
them if they watch pursuits and they say no way. If they didn't
watch pursuits, we wouldn't have been the No. 1 station covering
the (motor home) chase.''
</P>
<P>
   Police say the live broadcast of chases is dangerous for
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media really needs to cut back on the thirst for this
news,'' said Lt. Anthony Alba, a Los Angeles Police Department
veteran who's been dealing with the media since 1994. ``Stuff like
this creates further issues with youth and cheapens the value of
human life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a voyeuristic society that has a fascination with
danger, and my big fear with them is that something bad will happen
_ people will get killed _ and it will be broadcast live.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the chases embolden people to run from police is
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The California Highway Patrol reports their pursuits have gone
up in recent years. Between 1996 and 1997 _ the most recent numbers
available _ the number of chases reported went up about 1.5
percent, CHP spokeswoman Ann Richards said.
</P>
<P>
   For the LAPD, the booming fascination with pursuits comes at a
time when chases have actually declined, a phenomenon attributed to
stricter laws and changes in pursuit policies, which make officers
more selective about whom they chase and why.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, when Los Angeles officers logged 908 pursuits in the
city, there has been about a 40 percent drop in chases, according
to a new study. Only 534 pursuits were logged in 1998, the report
says.
</P>
<P>
   Alba asserts the live broadcasts are dangerous for all involved.
</P>
<P>
   The media reveal police tactics. During a chase, when you have
eight news helicopters in the sky and two police copters, the
potential for disaster rises.
</P>
<P>
   Alba says he's elated that Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne
Brathwaite-Burke is opening the debate over whether the media
should be required to use a pool helicopter in covering chases. The
move would significantly reduce the possibility of an air disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad someone else is finally talking about this. I've
wanted it for years,'' Alba said. ``I'm going to feel real sorry
for the first news copter that's involved in an accident. It's
unsafe, and the risk is unnecessary.''

EDITORIAL: WRONG TARGET IN BELGRADE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, May 10:
</P>
<P>
   American officials spent a nervous weekend apologizing to China
for NATO's bombing of its embassy in Belgrade, hoping meanwhile
that the incident would blow over without irreversible damage to
the nascent diplomatic efforts to restore peace in Kosovo. With
luck, it will. With luck, the angry criticism in Moscow and the
United Nations, and the dangerous demonstrations in China, will
recede. But this was a very careless mistake, not only because
several Chinese were killed, but because China _ as a member of the
U.N. Security Council _ is a critical component of any negotiated
solution in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The incident is not reason enough to suspend the air war against
Slobodan Milosevic, which Washington has correctly decided to
continue. Given Chinese and Russian sensitivities, it might be
appropriate to continue the undeclared pause in the bombing of
targets in Belgrade. But this should be a diplomatic gesture rather
than a fundamental change in strategy. The pause could also be used
to review targeting procedures to make sure that a big mistake does
not happen again.
</P>
<P>
   The timing could not have been worse. Last week, Russia agreed
with the United States and its allies on the core principles of a
peace deal, including an international security force in Kosovo to
prevent further ethnic conflict and to assure the safe return of
more than a million displaced Albanian refugees. This was a pivotal
agreement, and marked a significant shift in Moscow's position.
</P>
<P>
   But the allies also agreed that the mandate for such a force
must come from the U.N. Security Council, not only to insure the
force's credibility but also to overcome Serbian and Russian
concerns about the presence of foreign troops on Yugoslav soil.
Russia, though angry at the bombing, is unlikely to veto a Security
Council resolution supporting the force. An angry China might do
so. Officials from the United States and other NATO countries
argued yesterday that since a U.N. resolution on the security force
was some weeks away, the accident need not affect the final vote.
They also argued that if Russia backed a resolution, China would
not stand alone and veto it. But Washington clearly has some
explaining to do to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   It also has some explaining to do to the American public.
According to accounts provided in Washington and at NATO
headquarters in Brussels yesterday, somebody picked the wrong
building. The intended target was the Federal Directorate for
Supply and Procurement, a Yugoslav arms agency. Instead, the bomb
hit the embassy. NATO officials have pointed the finger at the CIA,
whose analysts may have used murky reconnaissance photographs or
outdated maps. The site of the embassy building is well known in
Belgrade. The directorate is housed in a white office building. The
embassy, several hundred yards away, is a marble structure with
blue mirrored glass and flies the Chinese flag.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement yesterday, Defense Secretary William Cohen
conceded that there had been a targeting error and acknowledged
that the military's ``extensive process in place used to select and
validate targets'' had not caught the original error. He also
called the mistake ``an anomaly that is unlikely to happen again.''
These are soothing words, but not entirely reassuring given the
fact that ever since NATO's strikes began six weeks ago, allied
officials have relied primarily on laser- and satellite-guided
weapons. Such weapons presuppose reliable targeting information on
the ground, and Cohen owes the public a fuller explanation of why
it was not provided in this case.

victim. Ms. McCarthy is a politician humbled by the way things work
here, but one who personalizes the continuing gun deaths to keep

<HEADLINE>
LEON BARZIN, 98, CONDUCTOR, BALLET DIRECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Fla., Mass., S.C., Calif., France)  (mk) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leon Barzin, musical director of the New York City Ballet in the
1940s and '50s and the head of the National Orchestra Association
for 36 years, died April 29 at his home in Naples, Fla. He was 98.
</P>
<P>
   Barzin played ``a quiet but prominent part in the musical life
of the country,'' Harold C. Schonberg of The New York Times wrote
in 1976, when Barzin retired from conducting.
</P>
<P>
   Barzin helped train several generations of conductors and
symphony musicians, pushed for hiring of American conductors and
women and black musicians. He also supported new music,
particularly by American composers. Barzin helped to establish the
New York City Ballet as one of the most musically sophisticated
ballet companies in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Barzin had a distinctive podium style. ``He was one of the first
of America's choreographic conductors,'' Schonberg wrote in 1976.
``As a conductor, he was of the crouch and tiptoe school. We all
looked forward to his entrances. A slim and aristocratic-looking
man, he would glide through the orchestra like an eel around
pilings in a dock, arriving at the podium in a sort of
uninterrupted streak of motion.'' During performances, Schonberg
added, ``he would not only crouch for pianissimos and get on tiptoe
for fortes. He also would dance to the music _ his beat was all
curves. He was fluidity itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Brussels, Belgium, Leon Barzin and his family moved to
the United States when he was 2 years old. Barzin, an early
proponent of linking music and dance programs, may have absorbed
the idea during his childhood as the son of a father who played
viola at the Brussels Opera and later in the Metropolitan Opera
orchestra, and a mother who was a professional ballet dancer. He
studied violin and viola with his father and later with Eugene
Ysaye in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Barzin began his professional career playing in the salon
orchestra at the Hotel Astor in New York in 1917. He joined the
National Symphony Orchestra as second violinist in 1919, the year
before it merged with the New York Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra.
Barzin was principal violist at the Philharmonic from 1925 to 1929,
playing for conductors including Willem Mengelberg, Wilhelm
Furtwaengler and Arturo Toscanini.
</P>
<P>
   Barzin's conducting career began when Toscanini asked him to
conduct a Philharmonic rehearsal so he could listen from the back
of the theater. ``Put your instrument away, Leon,'' Toscanini told
him at the end of the rehearsal. ``You are going to be a
conductor.''
</P>
<P>
   Barzin joined the American Orchestral Society in 1929 as
assistant conductor, and became principal conductor and music
director in 1930, when the group reorganized and was renamed the
National Orchestral Association. In 1958 he resigned from the
association, a training orchestra for musicians and conductors, but
returned to it from 1970 to 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Barzin participated in many projects to develop audiences in
schools and at the free summer Lewisohn Stadium concerts and
programs at college theaters throughout the nation. His one
obsession, he told John Battison in an interview in The Christian
Science Monitor in 1941, was to see ``every city of 100,000
population or more with an opera house and a symphony orchestra.''
</P>
<P>
   He also developed formats for children's concerts that were
designed to communicate that music is fun. ``You can't take a child
into a tremendous hall, throw a hundred men at him and expect him,
with no previous preparation, to concentrate on the music,'' Barzin
said in a 1950 interview in The Times, adding that in such
instances, the ``big thrill of the occasion'' is usually
``launching paper airplanes from the balconies.''
</P>
<P>
   Barzin was a founder of the New York City Ballet and of its
precursor, Ballet Society, with Lincoln Kirstein and George
Balanchine. In The Times in 1951, John Martin wrote that Barzin and
his musicians were among the ``unsung heroes'' responsible for the
company's popularity. Barzin felt that ballet conductors needed to
develop special abilities. A ballet conductor's duties ranged, he
said, from pushing dancers toward a greater musical sensitivity to
knowing instinctively whether a dancer has had steak or lobster for
dinner that night.
</P>
<P>
   He served as music director of the ballet company until 1958,
when he went to Paris to conduct and teach. He returned to Paris in
the late 1970s, and taught conducting in France and in videotaped
sessions in Fribourg, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Barzin received the French Legion of Honor in 1960. He was a
frequent judge in conducting competitions, a guest conductor of
orchestras in the United States and Europe and a guest teacher at
many American festivals and workshops. He also conducted the WQXR
and Symphony of the Air radio orchestras.
</P>
<P>
   Barzin is survived by his wife, Eleanor Post Close Barzin of
Paris and Vaux-sur-Seine, France, and Fribourg; two sons, Richard,
of Marco, Fla., and Leon Q., of Westwood, Mass.; a daughter, Lora
Childs of Spring Island, S.C.; a stepson, Brewster Morgan of
Sacramento, Calif., nine grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   On his retirement from conducting in 1976, Barzin spoke grimly
of the state of the arts in the United States. He said there needed
to be more places where young musicians could train and get
experience, more ways for professional musicians to relate to their
communities, and more general education in the arts.
</P>
<P>
   Without such education, he said in an interview at the time,
``people will become drooling morons in front of TV sets.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ M is for the many things he gave them.
</P>
<P>
   O means only that it's growing old.
</P>
<P>
   T is for the tears shed over this one.
</P>
<P>
   H is for a heart that's rarely bold.
</P>
<P>
   E is for an error big as Texas.
</P>
<P>
   R is for the rest of a season's excuses.
</P>
<P>
   Put them together for the occasion, and they spell the mother of
all turnovers by Scottie Pippen on a day when the Rockets once more
turned poise into an orphan.
</P>
<P>
   So you wanted more touches, Scottie?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe next time you won't dribble the ball in the clutch with a
pair of ham hands.
</P>
<P>
   So you want to be the man who shows the way to the top?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe next time somebody can show you the way to Glen Rice and
ask you to guard him.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen was given $14 million a year to bring the veteran
leadership of six championship campaigns, and in his first playoff
game with the Rockets, he came up positively small down the
stretch. Tiny, teeny, minuscule.
</P>
<P>
   With 7.6 seconds left in the game and the Rockets holding a
one-point lead, the player who wants the ball in his hands dribbled
into traffic in the lane and could not find a way to get it to
Charles Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   After an entire game in which Barkley toyed with LA defenders in
the low post to score 25 points, and in a fourth quarter when
Barkley devoured Robert Horry and J.R. Reid for an even dozen,
Pippen ran straight at Kobe Bryant and dribbled himself right into
the hardwood floor at the Great Western Forum.
</P>
<P>
   He claimed he tripped or slipped or something. But the truth is
he looked just like Duke's Trajan Langdon giving up the ball in the
last seconds of the NCAA title game.
</P>
<P>
   This was a time when the clutch performers make the critical
plays to hold on to victory, and there instead was Pippen letting
it slip out of his grasp like a wet bar of soap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that's been going on with us all season long,
and it's been costly to us in a lot of games,'' Pippen said. ``We
make mistakes, we make costly turnovers, and it kills us in the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   He made the mistake. He made the turnover on the kind of play
that it was believed would bring out the best of Pippen. But it
found him looking no better than Cuttino Mobley, who misread a pick
play with Sam Mack and tossed away a pass with 1:17 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Mobley is a rookie second-round draft pick. Pippen is the guy
with all the rings.
</P>
<P>
   The question is why the ball was even in the hands of Pippen,
rather than the top free-throw shooters, Mack and Mobley, in that
situation. And the answer is that he demands it.
</P>
<P>
   The question is why _ after the Lakers took advantage of his
turnover and a very questionable call against Mack that allowed
Bryant to make the two free throws to take the lead _ Mobley, and
not Pippen, their savior, was asked to attack the basket in the
last five seconds on the final play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I suggested that to the coach during the timeout,''
Pippen said. ``I thought it was a play that could work.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Rockets paid $67 million to hear Scottie say: ``Give it
to the rookie.''
</P>
<P>
   Another question is why, in the aftermath of the loss, Pippen
chose to shift the blame to Barkley for intentionally fouling
O'Neal on a defensive rebound with 28 seconds to play and the
Rockets up 100-98.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that foul we gave Shaq was a very smart play,''
Pippen said. ``We should have made them come down and work to
score. We gave them the opportunity, and he got a split (of the two
free throws) and put us in a position where we had to score. We
just put our backs to the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the hack-a-Shaq philosophy had served the
Rockets well throughout the day as O'Neal went just 5-for-14 from
the foul line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, our plan was to foul Shaq,'' Pippen said. ``But you'd
have thought that somebody might have told somebody that you don't
want to do that with a two-point lead and 28 seconds left.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Barkley played like a warrior all game long,
battling for 10 rebounds and even playing ferociously on defense
while giving up nearly a foot in height to Shaq during one stretch
of the fourth quarter when big men Hakeem Olajuwon and Antoine Carr
were in foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   So much for team loyalty, friends and comrades in arms.
</P>
<P>
   There is always room to question strategy after the fact. But
you don't do it by making public accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going back and forth with that,'' Barkley said. ``We
had that game, and we gave them a gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Much the way Pippen spent most of the first half giving Rice the
gift of wide-open spaces in which to operate, letting him drill
seven of nine shots for 20 of his 29 points that put the Rockets in
a hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he'll shoot like that again,'' Pippen said.
</P>
<P>
   Not if somebody puts a hand in his face rather than using it to
point fingers and make excuses that even a mother wouldn't love.

EDITORIAL: THE SENATE CONFRONTS GUN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, May 10:
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Senate will address an issue that has been part
of living-room conversations all across America for the last two
weeks. The issue is gun control, specifically a set of common-sense
measures to keep guns away from children and criminals. The
Democratic sponsors of the package _ basically a scaled-down
version of President Clinton's proposal two weeks ago _ hope that
their colleagues will treat the issue with the same gravity that
Americans have ever since the Columbine High School massacre.
</P>
<P>
   From that tragedy has sprung an urgent need and a rare
opportunity for progress on a problem that Congress usually tries
to duck. The measures will be introduced as amendments to a
still-evolving juvenile crime bill. They will leave those senators
who found excuses not to act after last spring's rash of school
shootings with no place to hide. How these lawmakers vote will tell
whether they care more about protecting children's safety or their
own cozy relationship with the gun lobby. For senators with spine,
the votes will not be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Parroting the line of the National Rifle Association, some
senators argue that the nation does not need new laws, only
rigorous enforcement of existing laws. Enforcement is not the
issue. The issue is the dangerous loopholes that were carved into
those laws because the NRA insisted on them. Among the loopholes
are those that exempt gun shows and the Internet from the
regulations that govern the sale of firearms in stores. The new
amendments would close them.
</P>
<P>
   Other proposals would reinstitute the three-day waiting period
for handgun purchases that expired on Nov. 30, ban juvenile
possession of assault weapons, impose criminal penalties on adult
gun owners whose children gain access to those weapons and injure
themselves or others, and raise the age limit for handgun
possession from 18 to 21.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the package is too modest. To increase its chances
of passage, the Democrats left out a provision that would limit
individual gun purchases to one per month. Such a provision would
curb gun traffickers who buy weapons in bulk in states with weak
laws and sell them in states with strong laws. Nor does the package
address the urgent need for a national gun licensing and
registration system _ a need dramatized by the fact that federal,
state and local law-enforcement officials needed two weeks to track
the guns used in the Littleton, Colo., shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, one of the NRA's best
friends, should set aside his normal inclinations and permit a full
debate on each proposal. The country deserves this debate, and the
timing is right.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Satellite-guided bombs from a B-2 bomber struck the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, on Friday night because
CIA analysts used outdated maps, and military databases designed to
catch such mistakes had the wrong address for the embassy, American
officials said Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   When the target was initially checked against electronic mapping
data in American military and NATO computers to protect against
civilian casualties, no red flags were raised because half a dozen
different government databases had the location of the old Chinese
Embassy in another part of Belgrade, not the new one, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   With an investigation under way and NATO still blaming the CIA
for picking the wrong target, American officials said Sunday that
something obviously went horribly awry in translating the location
of the intended target into information the military uses to target
its satellite-guided bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The intended target was the headquarters of a Yugoslav arms
agency, picked because intelligence agencies have long suspected
that it helped rivals of America to develop advanced weapons and
that it sold weapons to help finance the Yugoslav military,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence analysts in Washington apparently picked the
Chinese Embassy for attack, which was in its current location for
only two years, without vetting from anyone on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of the targets on NATO's hit list, the arms agency
was added only within the last several weeks, when allied planners
requested more sites to strike. Using both open and clandestine
sources, CIA analysts determined the street address of the arms
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Then, using various intelligence, including photographs, and
comparing the arms agency's street address to the addresses of
other known buildings on the same street, the same analysts deduced
what they thought was the building that matched the street address.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put an X on the map, but we put the X in the wrong place,''
one American official said Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The arms agency and the embassy are about 200 yards apart.
</P>
<P>
   The mistake was compounded when geographic coordinates for the
building, derived from aerial reconnaissance photographs, were
plugged into into the bombs' navigational system, officials said.
The bombs, which were dropped by a stealthy B-2 bomber on a 31-hour
roundtrip mission from its base in Missouri, flew precisely to
their assigned point, guided along the way by constantly updated
radio signals from a constellation of Navstar global positioning
satellites.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence failure led to a deadly case of mistaken
identity that killed at least three people and wounded 20. While
NATO spared Belgrade from bombing overnight Sunday, officials said
that military targets there had not been taken off the bombing
list.
</P>
<P>
   The outdated maps analysts were using came from the Pentagon's
National Imagery and Mapping Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday night, Defense Secretary William Cohen and the
director of central intelligence, George Tenet, faxed an unusual
joint statement to news organizations insisting that neither pilot
error or mechanical failure was to blame. Instead, they said, the
bombing was ``an anomaly that is unlikely to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, faulty information led to a mistake in the initial
targeting of this facility,'' the statement said. ``In addition,
the extensive process in place used to select and validate targets
did not correct this original error.''
</P>
<P>
   But with no further explanation than that for the accident, the
opaque statement gave no evidence for why American and NATO
officials are sure this will not happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got confidence in the process and we're going to
continue to target,'' Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's military commander,
said on the ABC News program ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   With Pentagon and intelligence officials refusing to say
anything more about the mishap other than that it was under
investigation, these questions are still unanswered: Who was
involved in the initial targeting? Why were American officials in
Belgrade not consulted? Why was the location of the new embassy not
in the military computers? How were the two buildings confused?
</P>
<P>
   Several intelligence experts expressed dismay at such an
intelligence blunder. ``I'm absolutely dumbfounded,'' said one
senior retired American officer with extensive experience in
picking targets. ``They should have known long before this conflict
where that agency was located.''
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence experts said Sunday that the accident also raised
questions about the wisdom of the government's decision in 1996 to
fold the CIA's photographic intelligence center into a new Pentagon
agency, a move that prompted many of the agency's most experienced
analysts to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, NATO's track record in the seven-week air war has been
pretty good. After more than 5,000 bombing missions that have used
more than 15,000 missiles and bombs, there have been relatively few
mistakes, largely because of political constraints imposed on both
targets and pilots' tactics to avoid downed aviators and civilian
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   NATO began its strikes on March 24 with a list of about 100
targets, allied officials said. Most of those targets were selected
by military aides to Clark, working with military planners in
Belgium, Germany and Italy and with a special set of aides to the
Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But the CIA also plays an important role, military officials
said. In fact, the targeting information for Serbian targets bombed
in Bosnia in 1995 was produced by the CIA's Balkans task force,
intelligence officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The target list is constantly being revised, with sites added or
dropped based on new intelligence and battlefield assessments.
</P>
<P>
   Once a target is identified for its military value, it is
checked and cross-checked for possible risks to civilians. ``Each
target has an assessment of high, medium or low collateral
damage,'' said one senior Air Force general, using the military
term for civilian deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The most sensitive targets, including the arms agency's
headquarters, require President Clinton's review and approval,
administration officials said. The intended target on Friday night,
the federal directorate of supply and procurement, has long been
suspected by the CIA of helping American rivals to develop advanced
weapons. American intelligence officials say Yugoslavia has a
rudimentary chemical weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials say the CIA picked the headquarters building, but
American officials acknowledged that NATO, the U.S. European
Command and the Pentagon's Joint Staff all reviewed and approved
it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   From the grainy airborne reconnaissance photographs of downtown
Belgrade that NATO military planners use to identify bombing
targets, the Chinese Embassy and a headquarters for a Yugoslav arms
agency situated nearby look very similar: same size, shape and
height.
</P>
<P>
   But at street level, there is no mistaking the embassy's marble
structure with blue mirrored glass, flying the distinctive Chinese
flag, from the Yugoslav military's white office building on the
other side of a major thoroughfare, Lenjinov Bulevar (Lenin
Boulevard).
</P>
<P>
   The address of the Chinese Embassy is No. 3, Ulica Tresnjevog
Cveta (or Cherry Blossom Street), and lies north of Lenjinov
Bulevar, the main highway running through New Belgrade. The address
of the arms agency headquarters is No. 2, Bulevar Umetnosti (or
Boulevard of the Arts), which lies south of Lenjinov Bulevar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone made an assessment of where on the street the target
was, using a variety of means,'' an American official said Sunday
night. ``We just didn't match the right street address on the right
building.''
</P>
<P>
   Both buildings were constructed two to three years ago. The arms
agency building is five stories high, a square, white stone or
concrete building, with a new wing under construction. The Chinese
Embassy is roughly five floors high, has a curved north end, and a
separate residence building at the back. The compound, with garden
at the back and parking for cars north and south, is encircled by a
heavy metal fence.
</P>
<P>
   The accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy underscores the
obvious limitations on the Pentagon's high-technology weaponry: The
thousands of precision-guided bombs and missiles are only as good
as the intelligence on which their targets are based.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Brig. Gen. Leroy Barnidge, commander of the Air
Force's B-2 wing at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, told
reporters that after more than 40 B-2 missions, ``everything had
gone where it's supposed to go and hit what it was supposed to
hit.``
</P>
<P>
   Tragically, that was also true Friday night. The B-2, carrying
up to 16 satellite-guided bombs called joint direct attack
munitions, carried out its assigned mission and hit its assigned
building with at least three of the bombs, American officials said
Sunday. Six Air Force B-2s had dropped more than 500 of the bombs
during the air campaign, Barnidge said last week.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, some influential lawmakers said the embassy strike
was a sign that U.S intelligence capabilities are stretched too
thin. ``I say it's a reaping of the harvest of the underinvestment
in our intelligence capabilities,'' Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., who
heads the House Intelligence Committee, said on ``Fox News
Sunday.''

A PERFECT MOTHER'S DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ If Mama said there'd be days like these, she said it
softly, to herself.
</P>
<P>
   Even Annette Fisher, watching from a floor-level seat at the
Forum on Sunday, must have found this one hard to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Her son, little Derek Fisher, isn't supposed to win playoff
games for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal is. Kobe Bryant is. Glen Rice is.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher is there to throw them the ball with the clock running
down and the game on the line. Assuming he's !ital!in!off! the game
at the time _ an unsafe assumption for most of the season.
</P>
<P>
   So what developed in Game 1 of the Lakers' first-round NBA
playoff series against the Houston Rockets?
</P>
<P>
   Happy Mother's Day!
</P>
<P>
   Shaq didn't make a basket in the final 4 minutes, 5 seconds, and
missed three of his last four free throws. Rice didn't make a
basket in the final 11:47 _ and heaved up an air ball with the
Lakers trailing by two in the last minute. Bryant didn't make a
basket in the final quarter _ though those were his free throws
that put the Lakers ahead to stay with 5.3 seconds on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Fisher was all over the floor _ literally _ and the
hero of the Lakers' dramatic, 101-100 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The unsung hero, if you didn't count the two dozen reporters
around him afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Who'd have believed it?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the fan who came up to Fisher in the Hallmark store where
he bought his Mother's Day card and congratulated him on his recent
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost a bet because of you,'' the man said. ``I bet the guys
you weren't NBA material.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' Fisher said Sunday, ``was one of the best and worst
things anybody's said to me.''
</P>
<P>
   With Mom in town from Little Rock _ toting the camera Derek gave
her for Mother's Day _ Fisher showed what tough material he's made
of.
</P>
<P>
   He finished with 20 points, establishing a playoff career high
and matching the regular-season high he set in a March victory at
Utah.
</P>
<P>
   That included a 3-pointer from the top of the circle with 4:32
to go, taking back the lead; two free throws with 3:02 to go,
breaking a tie; and two free throws with 1:17 to go, breaking a
tie.
</P>
<P>
   But the points weren't the point. The Lakers don't go to Fisher
for scoring. They pay big money to guys who are supposed to do
that.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, the third-year point guard from Arkansas Little Rock,
made the difference with hustling defense, and, for once, other
Lakers seemed to follow his example.
</P>
<P>
   The play of the game _ of Fisher's career _ came with the clock
on single digits and the Rockets leading 100-99. Houston's Scottie
Pippen dribbled near half-court. Bryant poked it away. Fisher saw
the loose ball and did what he always does.
</P>
<P>
   He dived. A full belly flop.
</P>
<P>
   He grabbed the ball with both hands and immediately signaled
``timeout'' with 7.6 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe that I could get there and actually control
it and call timeout,'' Fisher said. ``At that point I knew we were
going to win the basketball game. That kind of thing just doesn't
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   After the timeout, Bryant faked Sam Mack into a blocking foul
and made both free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Then O'Neal made the other defensive play of the afternoon,
blocking Cuttino Mobley's driving layup as the buzzer sounded. Fans
clambered over press row _ I'm expecting some soreness in the
morning _ to slap palms with Shaq.
</P>
<P>
   See, defense can be cool.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, 24, has always wanted to believe that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like that's my responsibility,'' he said of setting the
example. ``Tonight, everybody will be talking about my scoring 20
points. But when I see I made a play that changed the game on the
defensive end, that's what tells me I played a heck of a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher did his job. The rest of the Lakers responded. They
didn't play a great defensive game _ the Rockets made 52.1 percent
of their shots and Charles Barkley went around them like
driving-school pylons _ but they played hard after watching
executive vice president Jerry West rip them in an NBC interview
for failing to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lifted the team,'' Rice said of Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher hit the hard floor so many times, it was enough to make a
mother cover her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't get into the shower and it starts stinging,'' he
said of the floor burns, ``I don't feel right.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher stung, then dressed, then cut out of the locker room,
otherwise the interviews might have gone on all night.
</P>
<P>
   He and Annette had dinner plans. Perfect end to an unbelievable
day. &QL;

EARLY CONGRESSIONAL RACE'S WINNER COULD TURN OUT TO BE VOTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE, Calif. _ With the campaign already heating up for next
year's 27th District congressional race, local officials see
nothing but opportunity for their communities.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Republican Rep. James Rogan and Democratic
state Sen. Adam Schiff, both based in Pasadena, have been focusing
on hot-button issues, attempting to become the hero in the battles
over noise restrictions at the regional airport and a controversial
hillside housing project.
</P>
<P>
   California's 27th congressional district covers the well
established satellite cities of Burbank, Glendale and Pasedena
bordering Los Angeles to the northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two favorite sons competing to be the white knight,''
said Rob Sharkey, president of the Glendale Homeowners Coordinating
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank City Manager Robert ``Bud'' Ovrom said the city will
take full advantage of the competition in its fight to get a
mandatory curfew and a noise budget at Burbank Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our interest is to use both of them to the maximum. We're
willing to exploit them. It will be nonpartisan exploitation,''
Ovrom said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point both men planned their own ``peace summits'' on the
airport issue, which pits airport officials' designs for expansion
against residents' worries over increased noise and traffic in a
high-spending battle spanning years. Rogan is eagerly awaiting an
answer from the Federal Aviation Administration to his question
about whether the airport can impose a curfew without getting
federal approval. Schiff on Friday called on the FAA to grant a
mandatory curfew for the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff has asked for a $5million budget allocation from the
state to buy the Oakmont V property in Glendale to preserve the
brushy hillside land as open space. Rogan sought $20,000 in federal
funds to pay for an appraisal of the Oakmont property as the first
step in securing federal money to purchase the land.
</P>
<P>
   If either one is successful in stopping Oakmont V, Sharkey
predicted it will translate into solid votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they could bring that trophy home it would guarantee a trip
to Washington,'' Sharkey said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Schiff announced last month that he would take on Rogan,
who soared to national fame as one of the most prominent House
managers in the impeachment of President Clinton _ a role that has
made him a target of Democratic Party wrath and especially
vulnerable because the district could go either way.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Rogan resisted GOP pressure to challenge
Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein next year and decided to seek
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   The race is being watched on a national level and will bring in
heavy contributions from all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan is hitting up pro-impeachment Republicans who think of him
as a political star, while Schiff works Democrats who want to see
Rogan ousted as revenge for his impeachment role.
</P>
<P>
   But the battle locally has both men focused like never before on
the most emotional issues for their constituents. While both
candidates insist they have been tirelessly dedicated to
constituents' needs since the day they took office, district
residents agree both are taking much more aggressive approached to
local issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither one of them cared about the airport issue at all until
they were pitted against each other,'' Ovrom said. ``It was a
little awkward during the battling summits.''
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates have insisted they've been working on the
airport issue well before the competition started, with Schiff
noting he called for a mandatory curfew as far back as 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the competition is the fact that they have so many of
the same constituents. Rogan's congressional district is located
completely inside Schiff's state Senate district.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a rematch of sorts. Rogan disposed of Schiff twice in
1994, when they both ran for the 43rd District Assembly seat,
beating him first in a June special election and then again in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan is a former Los Angeles County prosecutor and municipal
court judge and Schiff is a former federal prosecutor. Schiff's
profile has been rising steadily since his 1996 election to the
state Senate and he's expected to provide a strong challenge
against Rogan.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political science professor at Claremont
Graduate School, said the dynamic is interesting because Rogan and
Schiff, who are political opposites, are taking the similar
positions on local issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do not leave your opponent alone in the center ring,
especially on issues voters care about,'' Jeffe said.
</P>
<P>
   This race has started earlier than most, in part because of all
the furor over impeachment, which has been a doubled-edged sword of
sorts for Rogan. He won his second term in November with just
50.7percent of the vote, squeaking by an opponent he outspent by
more than 2 to 1. His 27th District is now 45percent Democrats and
38percent Republicans and voters there supported Clinton in both
1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan's campaign manager Jeff Lennan said he and a cadre of
volunteers are overwhelmed by the task of responding to the 20,000
citizens nationwide who have written Rogan offering to help him
retain his seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen his donor base expand considerably,'' Lennan said.
``I was running through our contribution records and we've got 16
donors from Alabama and 23 donors from Connecticut. It's nothing
we've ever seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogan recently sent out a campaign fund-raising piece to
conservative activists nationwide seeking ``emergency pledges of
support'' to defend himself against an anti-impeachment backlash.
The mailer is topped with quotes from Democratic officials and
Hollywood media mogul David Geffen, all predicting Rogan's defeat.
Then there is personal letter from Rogan starting with the
question: ``Are we going to let them get away with it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to know from you ... am I going to fight this battle
against Bill Clinton alone? Or can I count on you to help me to
stand against Bill Clinton,'' Rogan writes in the mailer.
</P>
<P>
   Lennan said this mailer was sent out to 60,000 conservative
activists nationwide about three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lennan acknowledged that the competition has already started to
impact local issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, these issues are going to be used as political
footballs,'' Lennan said.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff said his competition with Rogan is ``great for the
district.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last couple of months Rogan has had to play catch-up,''
Schiff said. ``I have no doubt we will force him to advocate for a
curfew at the airport.''

L.A.'S TV STOPS EVERYTHING TO COVER FREEWAY FUGITIVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A horrific tornado hit Oklahoma, a deranged
motorist slammed into a day-care center, bombs fell on Belgrade,
but in Los Angeles the big story of the day, live on television,
was another freeway car chase.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, on this particular day, it was a slow-speed pursuit of
a lumbering, renegade motor home that news helicopters beamed to
millions of homes across Southern California for more than three
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a journalist, the chase wasn't a real significant story,''
said Jeff Wald, news director for KTLA-TV, the WB affiliate. ``But
our industry is viewer-driven, and every time there's a chase,
people tune in. It's all about what our viewers want.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Los Angeles, home of the televised car chase, a
cultural event that unfailingly draws crowds around TVs, as
everyone waits for a crash or _ even better _ a shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Ratings are the name of the game in the entertainment capital of
the world. And nothing gets viewer numbers quite like a freeway
chase.
</P>
<P>
   Police say freeway chases are on the rise, in great part because
these live broadcasts encourage people to run from officers to get
on television.
</P>
<P>
   Behavioral experts say this growing appetite for chases reflects
humanity's worst side, as viewers turn off sitcoms and soap operas
in the hopes of seeing a real-life drama unfold right before their
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When these pursuits come on, people say, `Oh gosh, not another
one,' but then they will sit there and watch for two to three
hours,'' said Dr. Bruce Gross, a criminal behavior expert at the
University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a morbid curiosity to see how they end _ if they have
to kill the guy or someone gets hurt or a major situation arises.
That's just the way society is, and it can be a real problem.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the man in the motor home pointed a handgun at
police and died in a barrage of bullets.
</P>
<P>
   KTLA and other stations had already dropped live coverage when
the chase became a standoff, Wald said. But ground crews kept the
tapes rolling, capturing the bloodshed for the morning news.
</P>
<P>
   It was the ultimate payoff for those who had watched.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, about 1.2 million viewers tuned to KTLA alone for the
drama, as compared to the average 700,000 that normally watch
during that period, Wald said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say TV performs a public disservice by airing the
chases. The ``glorification'' of police pursuits could even
encourage some to run, Gross said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is contempt for police or a person is trying to make
some kind of statement by tying up the roadways and the airwaves,
then televised pursuits could encourage that activity,'' Gross
said.
</P>
<P>
   TV stations only once _ and only briefly _ reconsidered their
aggressive drive to broadcast all chases to the very end.
</P>
<P>
   A distraught Long Beach, Calif., man shot himself in the head
April 30, 1998, as a million horrified television viewers
witnessed, including children who tuned in for afternoon cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Jones, 40, had stopped his pickup truck on an overpass
between the Harbor and Century freeways, then he unfurled a banner
and set himself, his dog and the truck on fire. He bolted out of
the burning truck and removed his flaming trousers.
</P>
<P>
   Then he shot himself to death.
</P>
<P>
   The shock and outrage by the on-air death provoked criticism
from many viewers and prompted TV stations to use a time delay for
broadcasting chases so they wouldn't get caught airing another
death.
</P>
<P>
   That lasted only a week or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viewers are driven by the thought that something bad will
happen _ that there will be a bloody payoff for watching _ and the
stations take advantage of that for ratings,'' said Cynthia
Rawitch, chairwoman of the journalism department at California
State University, Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``TV stations do not do a public service broadcasting these
chases, like they claim,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Behavior specialist David W. Stewart at USC blames the media for
creating an appetite for pursuits, but he said the attraction will
decline over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people in Los Angeles are awfully bored, and there's a
certain level of excitement created by pursuits because we want to
see how they end,'' Stewart said. ``But the recent excitement has
been created by the media. Car chases have been around as long as
there have been cars.''
</P>
<P>
   At a local Fry's Electronics store, when a chase flashes on the
wall of televisions for sale, the result is predictable: a crowd
quickly gathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a natural reaction. People will stop and watch,''
said salesman Rene Suguitan.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Bustos, 33, said he watches chases for excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's happening live and you want to see what happens,'' said
Bustos. ``It shows you how crazy some people can be, and how the
cops deal with it. It's kind of cool.''

COMMENTARY: WHY SOME GET BUSTED _ AND SOME GO FREE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BRENT STAPLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Drug arrests on the 10 o'clock news tend to show inner-city
blacks and Latinos being led away in handcuffs. But federal health
statistics show only slight differences in the rates of drug use
for whites and people of color _ and define the typical drug addict
as a white male in his 20s who lives in a suburb where drug busts
almost never happen.
</P>
<P>
   The Partnership for a Drug-Free America expects to spend nearly
$200 million this year to convince policy makers and affluent
Americans that the drug problem crosses racial, economic and
geographic lines. This point would seem self-evident. But the myth
that drug use is confined to the black inner city will be difficult
to dislodge.
</P>
<P>
   The Hartford Courant in Connecticut learned how deep the myth
runs when it published a series in 1992 that examined the lives of
drug addicts who supported their habits through prostitution.
Conditioned to think of drug abuse as a minority problem, some
readers were stunned that 70 percent of the drug-addicted
prostitutes shown in the series turned out to be white. Some
doubted that the story was true. The refusal to believe that white
heroin addicts exist was particularly self-deceptive in a state
that is almost 90 percent white.
</P>
<P>
   The same stereotypes have been at play for decades along the
mid-Atlantic stretch of Interstate 95, where the presumed link
between race and drugs has led state troopers to stop and search
black motorists based on race alone. The profiling scandal in New
Jersey is spreading. Last week Boston opened a profiling
investigation of its own.
</P>
<P>
   The move in Boston was helped along by a federal judge who
sharply cut the expected sentence for a black man who had been
charged with weapons possession after a random traffic stop. Judge
Nancy Gertner chastised the police, saying that nothing in the the
man's record or driving conduct justified them in stopping him.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the police record, the judge found a host of random
stops. She noted that ``African-American motorists are stopped and
prosecuted for traffic stops more than any other citizens'' and
suggested they were `imprisoned at a higher rate for these offenses
as well.'' Citing ``deep concerns'' about the disparity, the judge
gave the man 30 months, when she could have given him six years.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics from Maryland and New Jersey show that black
motorists are about five times as likely to be stopped on the
highway as whites. Even Americans who disapprove of racial
profiling tend to view it as a passing humiliation, with no broad
social import. But criminologists have long argued that profiling
goes well beyond the personal and exerts a substantial impact on
the criminal justice process and the broader social order as well.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a national conference last week, Dr. Dawn Day, an
addiction specialist from the Dogwood Center in Princeton, N.J.,
drew a connection between racial profiling of intravenous drug
users and the rapid spread of AIDS in the black community.
</P>
<P>
   The most conservative estimates suggest that white intravenous
drug users outnumber black users by at least 5 to 1. Even so, drug
sweeps tend to be concentrated in inner cities, which are widely
viewed as the sole source of the problem. Dr. Day's calculations,
based on federal data, show 5 arrests for every 100 white addicts,
but 20 arrests for every 100 black addicts.
</P>
<P>
   Unworried about random searches and arrests, many white addicts
carry clean needles so that they can avoid sharing needles and the
risk of getting AIDS. But black addicts know that they are
vulnerable to random search and arrest and often choose not to
carry needles. Instead, they share the needles of strangers,
getting AIDS and other blood-borne diseases in the process. As a
consequence, the rate of HIV infection for black drug users is many
times that of whites.
</P>
<P>
   Criminologists have argued for decades that racial profiling
plays a central role in the fact that black Americans make up a
disproportionate part of the prison population. Drug cartels have
long since grasped this point, minimizing the use of non-whites as
couriers and using people who look like mild-mannered suburban
housewives whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   Police departments have historically justified profiling by
arguing that it leads to valid arrests. But the practice also
exempts from scrutiny the vast majority of drug users and couriers
who are by definition non-black. The race-based practice catches
some of the guilty, but it violates the lives of many more innocent
people, undermining law-enforcement credibility in minority
neighborhoods. Finally, The myth that drug crime is a ``black''
problem, confined to ghettos, allows the culture to deceive itself
about the vast scope of the epidemic.

LOS ANGELES: kind of cool.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps the most remembered chase of all time, ironically, is
known for its slow speed _ O.J. Simpson's snail-paced return to his
Brentwood home in June 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the Simpson chase cemented televised police chases
as the new pop drama and became as much a part of Los Angeles
culture as In-N-Out Burgers.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a new phenomenon, however.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, the first ``telecopter'' hit the skies to take
weather shots, and soon after they were capturing crime scenes and
chases.
</P>
<P>
   The Rodney King beating and the Los Angeles riots further fed
broadcasters' obsession with live shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unusual for a reporter to be standing in an empty
parking lot at 11 p.m. doing a live report where something happened
15 hours earlier,'' said Rick Marks, a CSUN journalism professor
who spent 23 years as a news producer with NBC and its Los Angeles
affiliate, KNBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all consultant-driven. There's an idea that ratings will
jump if you can trick viewers into thinking that something is
happening live.''
</P>
<P>
   Wald defends the coverage of pursuits as a public service.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ultimate hope as a journalist is to show our viewers that
the bad guys don't get away, so there's no rational sense to run,''
Wald said. ``We want to deter people from getting involved in
them.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the chicken-and-egg debate over who has the blood lust,
the media or the viewers, Wald said it's definitely the viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask anyone if they watch public television, and they'll tell
you yes, even though they really don't,'' Wald said. ``Then ask
them if they watch pursuits and they say no way. If they didn't
watch pursuits, we wouldn't have been the No. 1 station covering
the (motor home) chase.''
</P>
<P>
   Police say the live broadcast of chases is dangerous for
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media really needs to cut back on the thirst for this
news,'' said Lt. Anthony Alba, a Los Angeles Police Department
veteran who's been dealing with the media since 1994. ``Stuff like
this creates further issues with youth and cheapens the value of
human life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a voyeuristic society that has a fascination with
danger, and my big fear with them is that something bad will happen
_ people will get killed _ and it will be broadcast live.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the chases embolden people to run from police is
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The California Highway Patrol reports their pursuits have gone
up in recent years. Between 1996 and 1997 _ the most recent numbers
available _ the number of chases reported went up about 1.5
percent, CHP spokeswoman Ann Richards said.
</P>
<P>
   For the LAPD, the booming fascination with pursuits comes at a
time when chases have actually declined, a phenomenon attributed to
stricter laws and changes in pursuit policies, which make officers
more selective about whom they chase and why.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, when Los Angeles officers logged 908 pursuits in the
city, there has been about a 40 percent drop in chases, according
to a new study. Only 534 pursuits were logged in 1998, the report
says.
</P>
<P>
   Alba asserts the live broadcasts are dangerous for all involved.
</P>
<P>
   The media reveal police tactics. During a chase, when you have
eight news helicopters in the sky and two police copters, the
potential for disaster rises.
</P>
<P>
   Alba says he's elated that Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne
Brathwaite-Burke is opening the debate over whether the media
should be required to use a pool helicopter in covering chases. The
move would significantly reduce the possibility of an air disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad someone else is finally talking about this. I've
wanted it for years,'' Alba said. ``I'm going to feel real sorry
for the first news copter that's involved in an accident. It's
unsafe, and the risk is unnecessary.''

 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Reality bites.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of cruising past the Buffalo Sabres was always a
fantasy. Losing Game 2 at home is reality. And it's just as well
that the more impressionable of the bandwagon fans the Bruins have
picked up in the past two weeks understand that particular reality,
however distasteful it may be.
</P>
<P>
   A combination of simple mathematics and playoff experience tells
you the Bruins are now in trouble after dropping a 3-1 decision to
the Sabres at the FleetCenter Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of puts us in the driver's seat,'' observed Michael
Peca, whose first-period goal was a huge determining factor in
deciding the outcome. ``We are tied and going back home. This
should really energize our crowd. Our building should be extremely
loud. The 82-game schedule drains the players, so why should the
fans be any different? They'll be ready, I'm sure.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no surprise out there on the FleetCenter ice. Coach
Lindy Ruff's wish was the Buffalo players' command. The spin coming
out of the Sabres' locker room following Thursday night's Game 1
was that the nine-day interval between the four-game conquest of
the Ottawa Senators and the beginning of this series was not
beneficial. By the time Buffalo got back into its rhythm at the
tail end of the second period of Game 1, the prize stallion long
since had fled the barn. The Buffalo belief was that period three
was far more indicative of their expertise, and that everyone in
Boston would be made aware of that fact in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   And even though the score was a manageable 1-0 after the end of
the first 20 minutes Sunday, there was no doubt whose game was
being played. The 17-5 shots on goal disparity was a pretty good
barometer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our first period was fabulous,'' maintained Ruff.
``We opened up the gates and kept coming. We could have come out of
there with three or four goals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They threw everything at us in the first period, probably
things we hadn't seen before,'' concurred Bruins mentor Pat Burns.
``Everything was black sweaters, bodies flying.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a nice little Bruins ride since the Game 4 equalizer
in the Carolina series. That started a four-game winning streak,
during which time believers started to believe even more and all
sorts of converts partook of the baptismal waters. People were
starting to think that Bobby, Espo, and Cheesie were back.
</P>
<P>
   Whoa.
</P>
<P>
   Things remain good. The future is bright. But in the very
graphic here and now, the reality is that the Bruins are up against
a very formidable opponent. Buffalo is a very solid team that is
more dangerous than just about any team in the league if allowed to
secure a two-goal lead during the course of any given game. And why
is that? Is that what you're asking?
</P>
<P>
   Duh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty comforting just to know he's back there, no matter
what the score,'' says Curtis Brown, who scored Buffalo's second
goal during a five-on-three situation at 5:57 of the second period.
``If I had to bet on it, I'd say we have more peace of mind out
there with him than anyone else has with their goalie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He,'' of course, is All-Universe goaltender Dominik Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say we relax if we're up two goals,'' adds Peca, ``but
if you get down to us by two goals you really have to battle. It's
got to be pretty discouraging knowing you've got to score three
goals against the best goaltender in the world. That's why it's so
important for us to get the early lead.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Now It Can Be Told Dept., the Sabres are free to admit
that nine days is just too damn long to go without playing a
serious hockey game at this stage of the season. Winning Game 1 in
this building against a feeling-its-oats Boston team might not have
been a feat comparable to the Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes, but
it would have been a phenomenal achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that the layoff hurt us,'' says Brown.
``The coaches did a good job trying to prepare us, but it felt like
we had been off for two months. It was like a brand new season.''
</P>
<P>
   No one was more acutely aware of the dynamics of the situation
than Burns, who would have been justified in starting his postgame
remarks with an emphatic ``I told ya' so.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted it more,'' he said. ``They did not want to be in a
situation where they'd be on the outside looking in. It was exactly
what I expected. They are a pressure team, so you have to do things
quick. We weren't quick enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, the Bruins weren't anything enough for the first
54 minutes, or until Don Sweeney blasted one past Mr. Hasek from
the circle to the Dominator's right to make it 2-1. ``There were
two guys on one side,'' analyzed Ruff. ``That was about the only
time we did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the crowd was in it, and things got very tense when Joe
Juneau was sent off at 17:16 for a high-sticking infraction against
Darren Van Impe. This, of course, is when you need some big-time
penalty-killing and some big-time goalkeeping, and that is exactly
what Buffalo got. The Bruins did not score, and Dixon Ward put them
out of their misery with an empty-netter at 19:23.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, you had one very concerned coach (guess who)
and one very relieved coach. Ruff was talking about a team that had
finished checks and had killed off a five-on-three penalty for a
minute and 47 seconds and that had come into Boston under a tough
circumstance and had come away with the opening series split every
reasonable playoff veteran _ be it player, coach, owner, GM, or fan
_ wants when the other guy has the home-ice advantage. The Sabres
left on such a high no one even bothered to mention that they are
operating without 40-goal scorer Miroslav Satan (foot injury).
</P>
<P>
   It's great to have people psyched and interested in the Bruins,
but part of a fan's responsibility is to know what is and isn't
realistic. Reality really does bite sometimes, and the reality here
is that this will be a very, very difficult series to win.

BRUINS' SLOW STARTS MUST STOP

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Over the course of an 82-game National Hockey League
regular season, what happened to the Bruins Sunday would not have
been out of the ordinary. In fact, it happens way too often for
various reasons _ too many teams, too many games, too many miles,
just simply too much hockey compressed into too little time to make
it possible, even fair, to expect a top performance every night.
</P>
<P>
   But the playoffs, now that's a different issue. Clunkers aren't
supposed to be accepted fare. When a team has everything to play
for (i.e. a viable shot at playing into June), then every second of
the clock is supposed to represent opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   When opportunity came knocking Sunday, the Bruins got knocked to
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was terrible,'' summarized Jason Allison, among the
collection of key Boston forwards who weren't into it from the
start and who, therefore, were quickly out of it. ``I was terrible.
And a lot of other guys weren't very good.''
</P>
<P>
   When the puck was dropped, the home team, in the black trunks,
moved to the center of the ring looking almost lovestruck. You
never know, it could have been the Mother's Day factor, too many
nice thoughts running through their noggins.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the other team in the black trunks, the Sabres, came
out with their legs firing and didn't allow the Bruins the least
bit of playmaking room. It was downright nasty. They kept breaking
over the blue line with speed and passion, in fierce pursuit of the
puck, denying, almost daring the Bruins to touch it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down low, they kept cycling and cycling,'' said Boston
netminder Byron Dafoe. ``It was like a feeding frenzy at times.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the wrong time for Boston to play bait. If not for
Dafoe, who had a handful of excellent saves in the first period, it
could have been 6-0 after 20 minutes. Instead the score read 1-0.
More poignant was the shot count, which had the Sabres holding a
lopsided 17-5 advantage. The Bruins barely could get out of their
own way, never mind head-man the puck or move to the other end of
the ice and set up around Dominik Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made no secret of the fact that we wanted to start the game
the way we finished Game 1,'' said Sabres captain Michael Peca,
whose squad played very strong second and third periods in the
opener. ``We wanted that start.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind his own bench, there wasn't much Bruins coach Pat Burns
could do. Under assaults like these, teams typically can chip the
puck out and relieve the pressure, at least momentarily, by forcing
the play into the neutral zone. Icing the puck is another option,
though not as good, because it results in a faceoff in the
defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth was, the Bruins were so out of it they couldn't
get possession to make the chip or wing it down the ice. In Round
1, faced with a similarly tenacious Carolina attack, they
consistently moved out from under the barrage and eventually made
headway toward the other end of the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Not here. Boston's forwards were helpless in assisting the
defense down low. Their defensemen, now looking tired after eight
postseason games, were suffocating in the blanket of black Buffalo
sweaters.
</P>
<P>
   What was Burns telling them?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say it here,'' Burns said in his postgame news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he preached the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get your head out of a certain area,'' he told them. ``Because
they're coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison had a pair of shots in the first period and he was the
only Boston forward to put anything on Hasek. Defensemen Kyle
McLaren and Ray Bourque combined for the other three. It wasn't
until the middle period, when the Sabres' aggressiveness turned
chippy and led to penalties, that the Bruins began to shape a game
with the puck. But they still weren't coming with the kind of speed
and muscle it would take to win a playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had to go out and get right back at it,'' said the
Sabres' Dixon Ward. ``We got in there with (Wayne) Primeau, (Erik)
Rasmussen, and (Michal) Grosek, and when they cycle it, it's hard
to defend. It wears 'em out. We dominated that first period.''
</P>
<P>
   The series now moves to Buffalo and the Bruins desperately need
their key forwards to reestablish their games. If the likes of
Allison, Joe Thornton, Dmitri Khristich (one shot, 20-plus
minutes), Sergei Samsonov (no shots, 11-plus minutes), Anson Carter
(one shot, nearly 23 minutes) and Steve Heinze (one shot, nearly 18
minutes) again show up with a game that looks a lot more
mid-February than early May, then it will spell trouble with a
capital golf Tee.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't Carolina, folks. The Bruins fell into a 2-1 series
deficit with the 'Canes and quickly figured out that they could
thwart the Carolina attack by denying them the dump to the corner
and the passing lane from behind the net. Once finding that key,
they unlocked the series in three straight games.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot more to the Buffalo offensive game, with or
without top goal-scorer Miroslav Satan. For five of the six periods
in this series, they've shown they can keep the pressure up, keep
the Bruins backpedaling. The only way for the Bruins to stop that
now is, first and foremost, be ready off the hop. They don't have
the speed or muscle to match the Sabre attack, but if they can cope
with the pressure and win some room at the other end of the ice,
they at least have the chance of forcing some shots on Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not what we had in mind,'' said Dafoe, reflecting on the start
that quickly developed into a downward spiral. ``We just couldn't
get it down there.''

RED SOX UNTOUCHED BY ANGELS 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-ANGELS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Mo Vaughn is in the rear-view mirror, Tom Gordon is on
the horizon, and Tim Wakefield is volunteering for double duty for
the suddenly solvent Red Sox, winners of four in a row after
dispatching Anaheim's crippled Angels, 4-2, before a modest
Mother's Day gathering of 23,710 on Yawkey Way.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, now two games over .500 (16-14) after falling two games
under the break-even point, completed a three-game sweep of the
Angels behind the pitching of Mark Portugal and relief help from
Jim Corsi and Wakefield, who registered his second save in four
days and is thinking of applying for dual citizenship, as both a
starter and reliever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to,'' said Wakefield, who is still scheduled to start
Tuesday night against the Seattle Mariners but would like to
continue his gigs out of the bullpen. ``It depends how I feel
between starts, but I could go down there and throw a couple of
innings.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a plausible scenario, given the protected species status of
Gordon, who is due to be activated from the disabled list Monday
but will be handled carefully until he proves his right elbow is
sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting thought,'' said pitching coach Joe
Kerrigan. ``I think he has the capability of doing it, because he
throws strikes. I don't think you'd have to worry about that
ninth-inning walk syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes to throw every day and the more he throws it, the
more consistent he gets with it. I think his background as an
everyday player (Wakefield originally was a first baseman) helps
him a lot, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to take care of Flash (Gordon), too. We don't want
to pitch him too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield came out of the pen for the third time in four games
and worked a scoreless ninth after Corsi, who has been battered of
late, retired Troy Glaus on a pop fly with Garret Anderson on
second and two out in the eighth. ``It was just one out, but you've
got to crawl before you can walk,'' Corsi said.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal's aura is considerably brighter when he works 7 2/3
strong innings, as he did Sunday, than when he is cashiered early,
which was the case in last Monday's infamous 12-11 loss to the A's,
in which the Sox couldn't hold a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro (Martinez) just pitched fantastic on Friday and (Juan)
Pena threw a great game (Saturday), so you see guys do that kind of
job you try to match up with what they did,'' Portugal said.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old righthander gave up a run on a two-out double by
Todd Greene and a single by Orlando Palmeiro in the second and
another run in the fifth on Darin Erstad's triple and a double by
Dave Silvestri, but allowed just two other runners as far as second
base and did not walk a batter.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal also did his part in adding to a lost weekend for
Vaughn, who managed to sneak in at least one visit on his gimpy
left ankle to the Foxy Lady but went 0 for 3 with two strikeouts
Sunday, giving him a final tally of one hit and six strikeouts (two
in each game) in 11 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a guy in here who was not happy to see Mo again,''
Portugal said, ``but when the umpire says play ball, you've got to
play nine innings. I've got friends all over the league. We should
know how to get him out, we've seen him hit enough. We would know
what his weaknesses are, and we were fortunate to exploit a couple
of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn was such a nonfactor this weekend that Sox general
manager Dan Duquette cheerfully emerged Sunday from two days of
near-seclusion to make a pass through the press-box area.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, meanwhile, waved off all reporters Sunday, except for a
prolonged heart-to-heart chat with Steve Burton of Channel 4.
``He's just shooting the breeze with him,'' said Angels vice
president Tim Mead. ``They're good friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's old friends in Red Sox polyester, meanwhile, roughed up
Lynn's Ken Hill for four runs on seven hits and four walks in 3 2/3
innings. Nomar Garciaparra hit his second home run in five games in
the second, Troy O'Leary singled home John Valentin in the third,
and Damon Buford tripled home the third run and scored the last on
Jose Offerman's sacrifice fly in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin had six hits over the weekend, Garciaparra and Buford
extended their hitting streaks to 12 and 10 games, respectively,
and rookie Trot Nixon had his first three-hit game of the season as
the Sox outscored the Angels, 16-3, in the three-game set.
</P>
<P>
   The four-game winning streak is only the second time since they
opened the season with five wins in a row that the Sox have won
even back-to-back games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to get something strung together,'' said
Mike Stanley, who did not start but pinch hit and replaced Brian
Daubach at first. ``It's been a season where we've been playing
some very good baseball and some very bad baseball. Obviously, if
we want to stay near or at the top, we've got to play consistent
baseball.''

BRUINS LOSE THEIR EDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's official: The Bruins and Sabres hate each other.
</P>
<P>
   After their victory in Game 1, Boston's players said it was too
soon for there to be too much vitriol, too early for any bad blood,
too little familiarity for it to breed contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. That all changed Sunday at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   Things got down and dirty in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference
semifinal series and it resulted in a 3-1 Sabres victory, tying the
series, as the venue shifts to Buffalo for Games 3 and 4.
</P>
<P>
   There was something for everyone _ nasty hitting, coaches
playing the ``psych out the referees'' game, a total of 16 power
plays. In the end, the beginning proved the Bruins' demise. They
came out flat, fell behind, and then mounted a comeback that fell
short.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted it more, they were hungrier, they knew it was a
situation where they didn't want to be on the outside looking in
and they really came after us,'' said Boston coach Pat Burns. ``We
expected that, I expected that from them. They've done that all
year long. There's a lot of character in that room.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the Bruins were too fancy, too tentative, too
ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   ``They threw everything at us in the first period that we had
probably never seen before,'' said Burns. ``Everything was black
sweaters and bodies flying.''
</P>
<P>
   After Game 1, Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff said he felt Burns's
antics on the bench helped work the referees into getting more
calls. Sunday, Burns said Ruff was working the officials in his own
way with those comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the referees even got intimidated there,'' he said.
``It was a good call by Lindy, getting that in the papers and
getting them to read that. Our bench got hell from the drop of the
puck. We didn't do nothing yet. Our trainer apparently was talking
too loud.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres were so much the better team in the opening 20
minutes, it wasn't even funny. They outshot the Bruins, 17-5, with
three of Boston's bids coming from the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost the game in the first period,'' said right wing Rob
DiMaio. ``I just don't think we were prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Peca put the Sabres ahead, 1-0, with a goal less than
two minutes in. Curtis Brown centered the puck and it glanced off
the stick of goalie Byron Dafoe and bounced right to Peca. He fired
it from the slot, beating Dafoe to the far side at 1:51.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obviously not a satisfying start for us,'' said Dafoe.
``We were not happy coming into this dressing room after the first
period. Playoff hockey, we can't allow that, especially against a
team like that. Getting down a goal early, it makes the hill that
much higher to climb, especially with Dominik (Hasek) in net. We
had to play catchup the whole game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' fortunes worsened in the second with the club
finding itself in penalty trouble. It cost them dearly. Ken
Belanger was called for roughing, Tim Taylor joined him in the box
for cross-checking, and the Sabres had a two-man advantage, their
second of the game, this time for 57 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Alexei Zhitnik, at the right point, dished a pass down for Brown
along the right goal line. Brown put it right between Dafoe's pads
from a tough angle and the Sabres led, 2-0, at 5:57.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was cheating a little bit,'' said Dafoe. ``I was spread out
because I was expecting passes. When he walked, I took the bottom
away but he put it over my stick and through my legs. He had to
beat me with a pretty good shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' best opportunity for offense came late in the second
when captain Ray Bourque drew consecutive penalties on Buffalo,
giving Boston a two-man advantage for 1:42. At 16:54, Peca drilled
Bourque at the blue line and was called for roughing. Only 18
seconds later, Zhitnik ran Bourque from behind and slammed him into
the Boston bench. He was called for boarding. Boston simply
couldn't get anything past Hasek, who wasn't overly taxed.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Bruins' best bids was by Dmitri Khristich, who had
the puck on his forehand, low in the slot. But with Hasek down on
all fours in the crease, Khristich couldn't get the shot up and it
went right into Hasek's crest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were way too soft, the passes were soft,'' said Burns.
``They're a pressure team so you've got to do things quick. We
weren't doing them quick enough. The (five on three) was too
diagrammed instead of being simple and basic.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins finally cashed in at 14:03 of the third, by far their
best period, when Don Sweeney tallied a power-play goal to pull
them to within 2-1. Too little, too late. Dixon Ward's empty-net
goal with 36.2 seconds remaining closed the door for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fought hard in the third period and made it close,'' said
Dafoe. ``We put a good effort in, but if you go back to the first
period, that kind of says the reason why we had to come back like
we did. We have to play with a little more emotion, with a little
more of a hate factor. This is a war now.''

IOWANS WONDER WHEN, OR IF, THEY'LL SEE CANDIDATE JOHN MCCAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Burnside likes what she's heard so far about Sen.
John McCain. For one thing, she says, the Arizona Republican scored
``brownie points'' by leading the national debate on war in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   But Burnside lives in Iowa, a state that places a special,
homespun emphasis on seeing their presidential candidates in the
flesh, not just in the news media.
</P>
<P>
   And so far, Burnside, of the small community of Storm Lake,
hasn't seen much of McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Neither has the rest of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's only a name in a newspaper rather than a physical body,''
said Burnside, 65, a Buena Vista County supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think he'll come here?''
</P>
<P>
   McCain actually has been to Iowa a few times, but has no formal
organization there yet. By comparison, he already has campaign
staff in New Hampshire and even South Carolina, on which he says
he's placing a ``high priority.'' McCain's relative inattention to
their state has Iowans wondering whether he plans to compete in the
2000 caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   McCain ``hasn't been here very much,'' said Hugh Winebrenner,
professor of public administration at Drake University in Des
Moines. ``He obviously is not making a concerted effort. The people
who are making a concerted effort are organized to varying
degrees.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowans have been guessing about McCain's approach, or
non-approach, ever since his campaign released an itinerary for a
planned April announcement tour that was later scrapped because of
the war in Yugoslavia. The tour was to have included stops in the
key presidential primary states of New Hampshire, South Carolina,
Arizona and California.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa was conspicuous by its absence. To traditionalists,
McCain's schedule was akin to touring Arizona and skipping the
Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Iowa regards itself as a bellwether of presidential
politics. Its neighborly caucuses _ which are, in effect, precinct
meetings held in all of the state's 99 counties _ have long been
regarded as key, early indicators of candidates' strength. The GOP
caucuses are scheduled for Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
   McCain insists he's not ignoring Iowa. His campaign staff is
careful not to slight the state, whose residents can be sensitive
to the possibility that the caucuses' importance may be slipping as
other states, such as Arizona, hold their primaries earlier and
earlier. Arizona's GOP primary is scheduled for Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't read too much into the announcement tour,'' said
campaign spokesman Howard Opinsky. ``It's awfully early to be
drawing conclusions about strategy when we don't even know exactly
what the primary schedule will be yet.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire's date, for example, is not yet set.
</P>
<P>
   Wondering about his intentions, the ``Des Moines Register,''
Iowa's largest newspaper, recently asked McCain about them point
blank at an editorial board meeting.
</P>
<P>
   His response: ``I've been here a lot in past years. I will be
here a lot, and I take it very, very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, McCain's tentative May schedule on his campaign
Web site (www.mccainforpresident.org) suggests other priorities:
planned trips to New Hampshire, South Carolina, Arizona and
California. No Iowa visits listed.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons McCain may want to avoid building high
expectations in Iowa by investing lots of time there.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa is ``labor-intensive,'' that is, it requires candidates to
build statewide organizations capable of turning their supporters
out to caucuses on a winter's night. For that reason, the caucuses
are a reflection not just of the polls, but of the candidate's
ability to organize.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a commitment of a person by a handshake, you'll
usually follow that up with a vote at the polls,'' Burnside said.
</P>
<P>
   In organization, McCain starts at a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our former governor of 16 years (Terry Branstad) is working
for Lamar Alexander, and he (Alexander) was here quite a bit last
time (1996), so people remember him because they have have met him
and because he came into the small communities,'' Burnside said.
``Pat Buchanan has been here, New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith has been
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, whom McCain acknowledges as the
front-runner for the nomination, hasn't been to Iowa yet for the
campaign. But Bush already has locked up the endorsement of all
four Republican Iowa congressmen, each of whom avoided endorsements
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates _ Dan Quayle, Gary Bauer and Buchanan _ are
likely to benefit from the heavy religious conservatives
participation in the caucuses. In 1996, 31 percent of likely GOP
participants identified themselves as fundamentalist or born-again
Christians, according to a ``Register'' poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to voting in the caucuses, the people who are
going to be out and participating do tend to be a bit more hawkish,
but they also tend to be much more conservative, and that's what
hurts McCain, I think,'' said Arthur Miller, a University of Iowa
political scientist.
</P>
<P>
   McCain mostly earns high marks from the Christian Coalition and
other religious conservative groups for his votes on their
centerpiece issues, such as abortion. But he also has alienated
many conservatives in the party.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in urging reform of the campaign finance system in
the last few years, McCain ``was way out ahead of his party, and
maybe he was at a position that was closer to what the public in
general would want, but not necessarily what Republican activists
would want,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Take ethanol. McCain says he won't waffle on his opposition to
the federal subsidy for the fuel blend, even though it could cost
him Iowa votes. Ethanol is made partly with corn.
</P>
<P>
   ``His ethanol stand puts him at odds with virtually everyone in
the state,'' Winebrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain is not going to change his message to go to
different places, and in Iowa he's going to talk about the same
things he's talking about in New Hampshire, the same things he's
talking about in South Carolina,'' Opinsky said. ``And that incudes
being against ethanol. And if that means that is going to cost him
there, then that that's the way it's going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a final reason McCain may choose not to emphasize an
Iowa campaign. It may simply be that Iowa, long treated by
candidates as the first meaningful contest of the season, may not
be so pivotal any longer. McCain has been paying a lot of attention
to California, whose primary is March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have big states that follow so closely behind Iowa,
such as California,'' Winebrenner said. ``In the past, it's been
dangerous to try to skip Iowa, but it might be that this is the
year to try it again.'' &QL;

<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Poor Cuttino Mobley never saw it coming. He could
only hear it when it was already too late. (begin ital)THWACK!(end
ital) Buzzer. Ball game.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal, all 7 feet, 2 inches and 330 pounds of him,
snuck up from behind, and, with one mighty swing of his tree-trunk
arm, swatted away Mobley's potential game-winning layup Sunday. And
with that singular, powerful motion, O'Neal lifted the Lakers to a
101-100 victory and 1-0 advantage in their first-round playoff
series with the Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   The poor Forum press table didn't see it coming either. As the
ball shot harmlessly into the hardwood at the final buzzer, O'Neal
kept going, slamming into the rickety table from one side, while
fans poured out of the baseline stands from the other side,
engaging in a spontaneous frenzy of fist pumps and hand slaps and
congratulatory screams.
</P>
<P>
   It was the swat heard 'round the world. And the Lakers enjoyed
every deafening millisecond of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely phenomenal,'' coach Kurt Rambis said of the play.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, no man of O'Neal's mass should be able to stay
step for step with a 190-pound point guard driving to the hoop.
This one does.
</P>
<P>
   ``For someone that's 7-foot-2 and over 300 pounds to have the
grace that he does... it's just amazing that a man that big can be
that graceful,'' Rambis said. ``You see him on tape or on
television, you'd swear he's only 6-9.''
</P>
<P>
   Phenomenal, too, that the Lakers _ worst in the league in
defense just weeks ago _ took the lead in this best-of-five series
on a defensive stop.
</P>
<P>
   But then that seemed appropriate on a day the Lakers won the
unconventional way.
</P>
<P>
   They did it with clutch defense down the stretch from O'Neal and
Derek Fisher. They did it by coming from behind after blowing a
double-digit lead. They did it despite a quiet scoring day from
foul-troubled Kobe Bryant (5 of 9, 17 points). And they did it with
a 20-point explosion from Fisher, the point guard known more for
his dives on loose balls than his scoring savvy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of the way we're playing,'' O'Neal said. ``If we can
play like that, then the sky's the limit for this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially if they continue to get the offensive bursts from
Glen Rice to complement O'Neal's inside game. O'Neal started slowly
but scored 27. Rice, guarded by all-world defensive stopper Scottie
Pippen, scored 29 _ including 14 in the second quarter, when the
Lakers took an 11-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   But on defense, the Lakers showed occasional glimpses of their
recent past, surrendering 52 percent shooting to Houston and
watching Charles Barkley (25 points) and Hakeem Olajuwon (22) have
their way in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Mack came off the bench to score 11 points in the fourth
quarter, as the Rockets overcame a nine-point deficit and made it a
tight game for the final 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   And then it all came down to a rookie, the ball in his hands
with five seconds left, about to steal Game 1 and the home-court
advantage from the Lakers. Mobley lost Fisher on a screen, leaving
O'Neal to make the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq's 7-4. He was right on my back, so I wasn't really
worried about him,'' Mobley said. ``But he made a good play.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, chided often for his defense, had to gloat a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rumor is, I'm not a good pick-and-roll defender,'' he said
wryly, while admitting to being ``a bit matadorish on defense'' at
times.
</P>
<P>
   It just made his redemption that much sweeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I know how to play defense,'' he said. ``I knew he was
left-handed. I kind of let him pass me and I just came from the
back. As soon as he put it out, I just went out there and got it.''
</P>
<P>
   It capped a series of game-turning plays in the closing seconds.
</P>
<P>
   With the Lakers down 97-96, Fisher knocked the ball away from
Mobley, then pounced on it, drawing a foul from Mobley. Fisher went
to the line and hit both free throws to retake the lead with 1:17
left.
</P>
<P>
   The next error, and the last one, was Pippen's. Working the ball
against Bryant, he slipped, Bryant poked the ball and Fisher
pounced on it. That possession change led to a pair of go-ahead
free throws from Bryant with 5.3 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The rest was up to O'Neal's big right hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels great,'' Fisher said. ``Shaq always tells us, if we
get hit by a screen, just stay with his (man) and he'll take ours.
Sometimes I don't listen to him because I'm always thinking I gotta
keep up with my guy. But the thing we've really improved on
recently as we've started to play better is trusting in one
another, believing in whether a guy is gonna make the shot or make
the defensive stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Or one big swat.

ANTI-U.S. PROTESTS MOUNT IN CHINA AS OFFICIALS STUDY BOMBING
ERROR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: ADDS 6th graf with China postponing some cooperation with
U.S., 8th graf with gasoline bomb hitting embassy, 13th graf with

<P>
   BEIJING _ American diplomats said they felt like hostages in
their offices Sunday as tens of thousands of furious demonstrators
marched for the second day to protest NATO's bombing of the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade and pelted embassy buildings with eggs, stones,
paint balloons and chunks of concrete.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday morning, as people returned to work and school, the
streets around the American Embassy were mostly empty under heavy
police security. Only one delegation of about 300 students chanted
slogans peacefully in front of the compound. As was the case
Sunday, the rest of Beijing was calm, although anti-American
sentiment ran high.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's demonstrations dwarfed similar protests held Saturday
because a large number of Beijingers flocked to the embassy
district to join student delegations from dozens of universities.
Some came merely to see the scene, many more to march, to sing and,
above all, to vent their anger.
</P>
<P>
   Just a month after Prime Minister Zhu Rongji's visit to the
United States, many of the protesters carried home-made signs
carrying thoughts like ``Blood for Blood'' or American flags marked
with tiny swastikas instead of stars. Some of the protesters
screamed insults at people they identified as American and one
American television journalist was hit on the head as she delivered
a live report.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration scrambled to limit the damage the
embassy bombing may do to a long-term relationship already battered
by differences over trade and human rights and charges of
espionage. President Clinton sent President Jiang Zemin a letter to
express condolences and lay out NATO's case against Yugoslavia, a
White House spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   But China Monday morning announced it was postponing planned
cooperation with the United States on human rights and military
matters.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Clinton's letter nor a statement of deep regret from the
U.S. ambassador to China, James Sasser, were carried in newspapers
in Beijing, where on Sunday long double rows of unarmed policemen
locking arms stood in front of both the British and U.S. embassies
on Sunday, and for the most part prevented protesters from
entering. But the policeman did nothing to discourage or stop the
rain of objects hurled from the street; a few even snapped
photographs.
</P>
<P>
   A gasoline bomb hit the embassy on Sunday night, but the flames
were quickly extinguished.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day Sunday, the imposing facade of the
embassy's old stone office building had been thoroughly defaced,
its windows broken, signs stolen, and its facade covered with
splotches of red and blue paint.
</P>
<P>
   Protests also occurred in a number of other cities over the
weekend, including Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenyang and the
southwestern city of Chengdu, where the U.S. consul general's home
was set on fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The embassy compounds are still under siege and today was
worse, at times much worse, than yesterday,'' said Bill Palmer, an
embassy spokesman in Beijing who said he was ``stuck'' in one of
the mission's buildings Sunday evening. ``We feel like we're
hostages. We can not come and go safely because of inadequate
Chinese security.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday evening, Vice President Hu Jintao gave an unusual live
television address in which he both endorsed the demonstrations and
cautioned against extremes, reflecting the government's desire to
maintain control while not alienating what is clearly a popular
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday morning, protesting student groups had to register with
the police guard and were reminded to be orderly. Some factories
had applied to send delegations, but were turned down, probably
reflecting the government's growing unease over worker unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese government firmly supports and protects, in
accordance with the law, all legal protest activities,'' he said.
But he added: ``We must prevent overreaction and insure social
stability.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The protest Sunday was an odd amalgam of extreme order and total
chaos, as tens of thousands of protesters marched the circuitous
half-mile protest route designated by the People's Armed Police,
passing the British and U.S. embassy compounds.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-afternoon on a glorious spring day, thousands of
protesters waited in line to enter the densely packed, slow moving
river of people that moved along the protest route, as if awaiting
admission to some outdoor rock concert.
</P>
<P>
   Delegations of several hundred students from schools like the
Beijing Chemical University and the Beijing College of Fashion
entered the route chanting angry slogans: ``American Killers'' and
``Revenge.'' A number had brought along rocks to throw at the
embassies. And the crowd applauded as protesters burned American
flags.
</P>
<P>
   A number of the protesters carried pictures of the two
journalists killed in the Chinese embassy bombing. The third victim
was the wife of one of the journalists. The bodies are likely to be
returned to China on Tuesday, possibly provoking a further public
outpouring of rage.
</P>
<P>
   Students took turns taking photos of each other. ``After the
bombing of the embassy, I feel more than ever that America is an
international bully,'' said Zhang Xingxing, a 20-year-old student
wearing a headband that read ``inexcusable murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Saturday's protesters, who were nearly all students,
Sunday's crowds included businessmen, lawyers, teachers and mothers
with children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the news on the radio while riding in a taxi, and my
shock quickly turned to disbelief, then outrage,'' said Ding Ming,
26, an outgoing young man in a polo shirt who works for an
insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   Ding came to the embassy Saturday night with friends and then
again Sunday with his girlfriend. ``We just walked about _ we do
not throw rocks and bottles,'' he said. ``Yes, there were some in
the crowd who went to extremes, but most people here are sensible.
They know their issue is with the American government and still
have friendly feelings towards the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The police generally kept the crowd moving on Sunday but allowed
stops in front of both the British and U.S. embassies, where the
protesters often turned aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday afternoon at the British Embassy, one student got through
police lines to scale the wall of the elegant red building and
lowered the Union Jack.
</P>
<P>
   But the featured stop was clearly the No. 3 Compound of the U.S.
Embassy, which houses the offices of top embassy officials,
including the ambassador. The paint-stained building looked like an
amusement park target. In the dense crowd, groups of young men set
off firecrackers, broke up pieces of sidewalk to use as missiles,
begged police officers to let them in to steal the American flag
and gawked at the battered cars that remained in a nearby embassy
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The People's Armed Police have told U.S. officials here that
they will insure that the protesters do not get into the embassy
grounds, but make no other guarantees, said Palmer, the embassy
spokesman. He said that his office has more than a dozen holes in
its windows and an equal number of chunks of concrete on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   An American student living in China, Shuan Rein, said he was
beaten by a group of protesting Chinese workers in front of the
U.S. Embassy gate on Sunday when he tried to explain that the
Americans were sorry about the bombing. Students rescued him and
the police took him away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the stone throwing is understandable because what was
done is intolerable, so I understand why people are driven to
extreme reprisals,'' said Ding Rong, a 29-year-old industrial
designer, who said she came because she attended the same
elementary school as one of the slain reporters.
</P>
<P>
   At various moments on Sunday afternoon, Cuban diplomats,
apparently buoyed by such a fervent resurgence of anti-American
sentiment in China, held up huge photographs of Castro shaking
hands with Jiang. They shouted ``Long live socialism. Down with
America. Long live China,'' and crowds returned the refrain.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the protests said they would most likely return to their
studies or jobs on Monday. They were uncertain of exactly what they
wanted from NATO or the United States, but yearned for some kind of
revenge. Placards carried messages like ``Hang Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Ding Rong said that she hoped the protest would both humble the
Americans and encourage China's leaders to protest more forcefully
against the bombing. Others said they merely sought an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to offer a fair and sincere apology and to
thoroughly investigate the matter,'' said Ding Ming. ``It seems
unbelievable that three bombs could fall on a foreign embassy by
mistake.''

CBS TO PUT GUMBEL ON DISPLAY IN MORNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CBS has a history of loud explosions in the morning, and right
now disaster seems to be smeared all over Bryant Gumbel's puss.
</P>
<P>
   So CBS' plans to reconstitute ``This Morning'' as a vehicle for
its $5 million amateur golfer already sound like a Gumbel fumble.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference in New York last week, CBS said it will
sink $20 million into a street-side studio in the General Motors
Building to put the morning program's famous anchor on public
display.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the new show is named in the fall _ ``Yesterday'' comes
to mind, in honor of Gumbel's past success on NBC's ``Today'' _
it's still another variation of the ``CBS Morning News'' or ``This
Morning.''
</P>
<P>
   And what a legacy. No network over the decades has programmed
itself more winningly than CBS. Yet the morning franchise dug
itself into third place back in TV's Paleozoic period, and it
hasn't budged.
</P>
<P>
   Here is where Walter Cronkite _ Walter Cronkite! _ clowned with
a puppet lion.
</P>
<P>
   Where Sally Quinn foundered in ignorance of such TV fundamentals
as camera cues.
</P>
<P>
   Where Phyllis George thought that it would be just swell if a
rape victim allowed herself to be hugged by the man who raped her.
</P>
<P>
   Where Kathleen Sullivan decided that CBS stood for ``Cheap
Broadcasting System.''
</P>
<P>
   Where chatty Mariette Hartley was so unstoppable that she kept
talking even after her clip-on microphone fell off.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, it's usually been where one of two things happens:
Your career dies right in front of you, or you pack and change
networks.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS position is understandable. It's paying Gumbel $5
million a year for his prime-time newsmagazine, for all his
prime-time specials and for the astute ideas he's bringing to CBS'
Eyemark syndication arm.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Public Eye'' flopped, you might have missed the prime-time
specials and those exciting syndication prospects haven't
materialized. Gumbel has been a man at leisure for the past year.
</P>
<P>
   CBS is eager to get its expensive acquisition back into harness.
All the better that it'll be in his old morning time period.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Friedman, once Gumbel's executive producer at ``Today''
and now a CBS station executive in New York, will pitch in. The
network has to figure that Gumbel can regain a morning audience.
Anyway, what's to lose? It can still keep the spiffy new studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Been there, done that _ that's no longer my arena,'' Gumbel
said in 1997, when asked if he'd anchor a morning show on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's the one who ought to be wary. Even a man of his
generous self-esteem must know that if he fails here, the dominoes
will topple all the way back to his ``Today'' credits. His critics
will say it was Katie Couric all along, and not he, who took
``Today'' to the top.
</P>
<P>
   At last week's press conference, Gumbel, 50, said his paid
absence from television hadn't been onerous at all. He added that
he felt no guilt about accepting his CBS paychecks, ``and I don't
think people upstairs at CBS think I should feel guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the suits at CBS have been gnashing their teeth over
Gumbel's blithe idleness and his apparent preference for golf links
over TV studios. And they have been wondering, disparagingly,
whether any competitive fire still burned in Gumbel's belly.
</P>
<P>
   Morning news viewers are notoriously stubborn about changing
channels. Right now, the weirdly formatted ``This Morning'' has
half the viewers of ``Today'' and about three-quarters the ``Good
Morning America'' audience. So maybe ``GMA'' can be challenged and
eventually caught. That would more than validate CBS' investment in
Gumbel.
</P>
<P>
   But broadcasting history suggests that the Gumbel program will
join the list of kaffeeklatsch casualties at CBS. Then his CBS
contract will expire, the network won't offer a new deal, and
Gumbel can resume his sporadic slide into comfortable retirement.

REVOLUTION PREVAILED WITHOUT ZENGA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Revolution's first look at life without Walter
Zenga was unpleasant. They lost nine successive games in 1997, then
failed dismally after he retired last season.
</P>
<P>
   But Zenga's return as player-coach has brought the team a style
of play and bolstered confidence. Zenga has not worked miracles,
but the Revolution's propensity to defend has given them a point of
reference and provided a third-place standing in the Eastern
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Their most recent experience without Zenga was the final 23
minutes of Saturday night's game against the Miami Fusion. Zenga
departed with a right groin strain and is questionable for the
team's visit to Columbus Saturday. The Revolution, though,
performed well enough to play to a 0-0 tie in regulation, and won
the shootout, 3-2, as reserve goalkeeper Jeff Causey remained
poised and stymied some dangerous assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga's status will be determined later this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter will basically take the next two days off from
training,'' Revolution spokesman Derek Aframe said Sunday. ``The
groin bothered him when we played Kansas City (April 3), then he
took two days off and was fine. This is a little worse, but Walter
should be available for the next game.''
</P>
<P>
   Causey's performance came at a critical time. Last season, the
Revolution had 10 points through seven games but did not earn
another point until July. Now they have 7 points in seven games and
are facing matches at Columbus, Los Angeles, and the MetroStars.
</P>
<P>
   They could remain in contention in the Eastern Conference or
face a crisis similar to those of the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga's setback fits in with the theme for the season, as Imad
Baba (groin) and John Harkes (sprained right knee) have yet to
play, and Richard Goulooze (calf), Paul Keegan (sprained right
knee), and Ivan McKinley (suspension) were out against Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Goulooze and Harkes, former teammates at Derby County in
England, are expected to return against Columbus. The Revolution
should improve as injuries heal, but there is no guarantee others
will not be injured.
</P>
<P>
   Among Zenga's objectives this season was to improve the
Revolution's depth, but there are questions about whether it has
been improved enough. Several reserves have been used and others
have played out of position in recent games, and the Revolution
have held together but shown little improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution have earned only 1 point in four home games. But
they have lost only once in regulation time this season and have
outscored road opponents, 5-3. They must now step up their
offensive production or at least become less predictable in the
transition to attack.
</P>
<P>
   The defense solidified against Miami as Brian Dunseth performed
much better in an inside position and Mike Burns brought stability
to the right side, though he seemed unable to overlap into attack.
Kris Kelderman has been ineffective at defensive midfield in the
last two games and Jair appears out of position on the wing. Edwin
Gorter and Joe-Max Moore played some effective combinations late in
the game, but Moore and Giovanni Savarese are not receiving many
scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Columbus-Revolution game will be the first at the
22,000-seat Crew Stadium, the first major US stadium built
primarily for soccer since the 1920s.

 VAUGHN, BAT SILENT
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   BOSTON _ Move on, Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   That was the advice Anaheim hitting instructor Rod Carew gave
the struggling Angels slugger and former Red Sox star Sunday. Carew
encouraged Vaughn to put the 1-for-11 weekend at Fenway Park behind
him. Ditto the ovations and the jeers from the fans, and the
pressure of wanting to do well in his first return to Fenway in a
visitor's uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Carew also reminded Vaughn to exercise his right to remain
silent. ``I went in (the trainer's room) and asked him, `Do you
feel you have to talk to these guys out here?' '' Carew said,
``because I think mentally it's tough right now. I hope the guys
understand. Give him the time to chill out a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `You don't have to talk to those guys out there.
If you want to, you can, but you don't have to. Give yourself a
little breathing room.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn heeded Carew's advice. When reporters assembled before
his locker following the Angels' 4-2 loss to the Red Sox, he said
he did not want talk, got up, said, ``See you all later,'' and
retreated to the trainer's room. He stared out at reporters
repeatedly from the trainer's room.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, Angels vice president for communications Tim Mead
informed reporters that Vaughn would not be not fielding questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to get his thoughts and everything back together,''
said Carew, who added that Vaughn's left ankle, injured in the
Angels' first game of the season, probably still is bothering him.
Sunday, Vaughn went 0 for 3, striking out swinging in the fifth and
eighth innings. He reached after being hit by a pitch, but the only
time his bat made contact with the ball was in the first inning,
when he lined to right fielder Trot Nixon. He is now 1 for his last
17 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Each time Vaughn stepped to the plate Sunday he was showered
with a mixture of cheers and boos, the same greeting heard
throughout the three-game series. Each time he struck out, there
were nothing but cheers. There also were cheers when Red Sox first
baseman Brian Daubach hit a hard drive Vaughn's way and he reached
forward to snare the ball but had it roll past him.
</P>
<P>
   When he took the base after being hit by a pitch, Vaughn was
booed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (the ankle injury) is still there,'' said Carew. ``But
he knows he came here to play and not stay on the bench. He knows
we have some key guys injured and the load is on him, and he's
going to go out there and carry the load.''
</P>
<P>
   Carew said that's all the more reason for Vaughn to move forward
and put the weekend behind him. Anaheim begins a three-game series
in New York Tuesday. ``I knew this was going to be a tough series
for him coming back here being under the light and everybody
looking and wondering what is going to happen,'' said Carew. ``It
grinds on you mentally, but he's going to be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately following the game, about 25 fans gathered outside
the Angels clubhouse, chanting, ``We love Mo.'' Vaughn waved to the
fans before heading into the clubhouse. Then, just before leaving
the park at 5:40 p.m., Vaughn greeted several fans huddled in front
of his limousine and signed a few baseballs and photos. Then he
departed.
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Terry Collins declined to say how much Vaughn's
homecoming affected the slugger. ``Only Mo can answer that,'' he
said. ``I certainly can't sit there and say that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys know him, those who have been around him more than
me, and I don't think I've been around a stronger human being
mentally. I'm sure he dealt with it in his own way. I know one
thing: He wanted to hit better than he did.''

THE WHOLE STAFF IS PITCHING IN 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-PITCHING-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Whatever it takes to win. You'll be hearing that phrase
a lot around the Red Sox' clubhouse from now on. And maybe it's not
a bad idea for the Fenway Faithful to adopt that philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly was a recurring theme Sunday after a three-game
sweep of Mo Vaughn and the Anaheim Angels. The celebration in the
clubhouse seemed a bit greater than what might have been expected
after four victories in a row. There seemed to be unanimous joy
that the sum of the parts equals the whole once again, especially
regarding the pitching. When the Red Sox come together as a team,
they have their best chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   When the Red Sox limped home from a 2-5 road trip that left them
with a 12-13 record, the picture looked bleak. Tom ``Flash'' Gordon
was on the disabled list and soon was joined by Bret Saberhagen.
Facing the Texas Rangers and the Angels seemed an invitation to
disaster. But the Sox won four of the five and may be an even
better team because of the adversity of the last week or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a ballclub of unselfish players,'' said knuckleballer
Tim Wakefield, who came out of the bullpen for Boston Sunday and
recorded his second save. ``Whatever it takes to win that day.
That's (manager) Jimy Williams's philosophy, and a lot of us are
happy to be a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week in Oakland, the team was hitting and the pitching
wasn't there. It's just a matter of getting the hitting untracked,
the pitching untracked, and the defense. It takes all three to win
ballgames, and it seems like we've got that under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston had no trouble scoring runs against Minnesota and
Oakland, but lost five of seven. Against Texas and Anaheim, a
return to the early-season excellence of the starting pitching was
needed. That is exactly what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Rapp didn't last beyond a third of a inning and Boston lost
to the Rangers Wednesday, 8-3. Saberhagen went three innings
Thursday, but when he went down, the Sox still managed a 3-2
victory because of the relief work of Derek Lowe, Rheal Cormier,
and Wakefield. Then came a couple of strong starting performances
by Pedro Martinez and Juan Pena, who simply overwhelmed the Angels.
By the time Mark Portugal finished off Anaheim in Sunday's 4-2
victory, there was a sigh of relief everywhere. And it felt good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things happen over the course of a 162-game season,'' said
Williams. ``When things go wrong, the players straighten it out. A
lot of different people are contributing. One by one, they all have
their moments in the limelight where they can contribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were losing before, we hit the ball well and scored a
lot of runs. Today, we had some opportunities and we made the most
of them. I believe in our pitchers. I believe in those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   When John Wasdin pitched 6 2/3 strong innings of relief
Wednesday, it gave a great break to the bullpen. The Sox were then
able to use Pena in a starting role Saturday, and his six innings
of strong work were the key to a 6-1 victory. Again, the bullpen
was needed only sparingly, and Sunday's 7 2/3 innings by Portugal
seemed to line things up very nicely.
</P>
<P>
   The starters are set up and the bullpen is rested for three
games against Seattle. Look for Gordon to be declared ready for
duty soon, although when and how much is still undetermined.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get Flash back tomorrow, everybody will be in their
regular roles in the bullpen,'' said pitching coach Joe Kerrigan.
``Everyone should fit into their proper time frame of the game and
can expect to pitch in that time frame. We can come at you pretty
good with the right-left game and the mixing and matching pretty
good. It gives the skipper some leeway in what he can do out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox will carry 12 pitchers, to provide insurance in case
Gordon has any trouble and/or Saberhagen responds slowly to
treatment while on the disabled list. Williams has touted all along
the benefits of having Wasdin, who has started, around for bullpen
duty. Pena has pitched only as a starter. It makes a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good going into the game (Wednesday),'' said Wasdin.
``I've been starting, but I also feel I can help out the bullpen. I
have confidence in my ability. There are a lot of different
situations that can arise. I've been lucky to have every role there
is. It's made me a little bit better, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   At his recent rate, Wakefield could become a 30-30 man. That's
30 starts and 30 saves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you'll see that happen,'' the knuckleballer
said. ``But I'm willing to go out there (in relief) between starts
every time if I feel well physically. If I threw a complete game of
125 pitches, I don't think I'd be out there. With Sabes going on
the DL, it makes it more of a challenge for me to go down there.''

BUFORD EARNING HIS STRIPES 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-BUFORD-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When Damon Buford sent a Kenny Hill fastball into the
gap in right-center for an RBI triple in the fourth inning of
Sunday's 4-2 victory over the Angels at Fenway Park, it was just
the first half of his personal 1-2 punch that helped KO the
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Buford's hit drove home run No. 3 for the streaking Red Sox, and
he came home shortly thereafter on Jose Offerman's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   But the former Oriole, Met, and Ranger _ who extended his
hitting streak to 10 games (14 for 41, .341) _ wasn't done
bedeviling the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Just after taking the field for the fifth inning, center fielder
Buford ran down a Jeff Huson drive, making a graceful sliding stab
in left-center.
</P>
<P>
   He nearly duplicated the feat when the very next batter, Darin
Erstad, hit a line drive to just about the same spot, but this one
bounded past the diving Buford, with Erstad winding up on third.
</P>
<P>
   A platoon player last season, when Darren Bragg would face
righthanded pitching and Buford would take on the lefties, Buford
has seen more playing time this year because of the slow starts at
the plate by Trot Nixon and Darren Lewis, plus Lewis's three-game
suspension after his altercation with Indians pitcher Jaret Wright.
</P>
<P>
   He has responded with a .310 average, hitting above .300 against
both righthanders and lefthanders.
</P>
<P>
   An Orioles 10th-round draft pick in 1990 and the son of former
major leaguer Don Buford, who is Baltimore's assistant director of
player development, Buford said after Sunday's 1-for-4 performance
that he wasn't even aware of his hitting streak, and he downplayed
his offensive and defensive heroics. ``It was a good all around
game for the whole team,'' said Buford. ``We got good pitching and
defense and timely hitting, so it was a good win.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his highlight-film catch ``was tougher than normal
because of the day game and the conditions. There were a lot of
white shirts in the stands and the ball was kind of dying away from
me, but I saw Troy (O'Leary) behind me and so I took a chance and
dove for it.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't as fortunate with Erstad. ``It was almost the same
play, but Erstad hit his a little bit harder and it was sinking a
little bit more,'' he said. ``But I'll tell you what: I'd try it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   When he came to the plate in the fourth, Scott Hatteberg was on
first base via a leadoff walk. ``It was one of those times in the
game when Kenny was struggling to throw strikes,'' said Buford. ``I
just took advantage of the situation. We kind of let him off the
hook earlier in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But Buford was reluctant to make any prediction based on his or
his team's recent progress. ``We've still got a whole season ahead
of us,'' he said. ``So it's not something you want to talk about
too much. I come to the ballpark every day, do my workouts, and
stay ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's my time to play, I go out and play hard and leave it
out there. But it's too early to talk about the team or myself
turning any corners.''
</P>
<P>
   But he has managed to turn a couple of heads in the Red Sox
clubhouse _ those of manager Jimy Williams and hitting coach Jim
Rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's played like this since he's been here and he's been
playing more against righthanders,'' said Williams. ``He's just a
good player.''
</P>
<P>
   And, added Rice, he's a player who has made some positive
changes since coming to the Red Sox. ``He's made the change from
being strictly a pull hitter,'' said Rice. ``He's learned to hit
the ball where it's pitched, and he has power to the opposite
(right) side.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's capable of being successful that way.''
</P>
<P>
   After his blast off righthander Hill Sunday, you wouldn't get an
argument on that from the Angels.

SERIES WILL BE PUNISHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There is a fine line between vigilance and vigilantism,
and the Buffalo Sabres either straddled it or strangled it Sunday,
depending on one's viewpoint _ assuming one wasn't viewing the
point through swollen black eyes, as many of the combatants were.
</P>
<P>
   The result was indisputable: The Sabres throttled the Bruins,
3-1, at the FleetCenter and evened this best-of-seven Eastern
Conference semifinal scrum at 1-1. But whether they achieved this
through robust clutch-and-grab hockey or borderline assault and
battery is a matter of testimony. The Bruins weren't angels,
either, as goalie Byron Dafoe observed once he got out from under
siege.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some cheap shots on both sides,'' he said. ``The hate
factor is a part of it. We have to hate them. They're the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   If the case goes to trial, there probably will be four major
items of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A: At 15:39 of the first period, Bruins defenseman Kyle
McLaren left the ice, his right eye looking like the Red River,
after Sabres forward Vaclav Varada swatted him with his stick.
Referee Kerry Fraser was a witness, though he made no call.
</P>
<P>
   ``They threw everything at us in the first period,'' said Bruins
coach Pat Burns. ``I think they intimidated the referees, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit B: At 8:54 of the second period, Bruins forward P.J.
Axelsson staggered to the bench, his left knee wobbling like
Jell-O, after Buffalo defenseman Alexei Zhitnik delivered a
knee-on-knee hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to take the body,'' said Zhitnik. ``He never moved
away. I don't know what happened after that.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened was that Buffalo captain Michael Peca, another
master of sub rosa work, was penalized for holding on the other
side of the ice as Zhitnik escaped scot-free.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit C: At 17:12 of the second came the main event. Repeat
offender Zhitnik dropped Bourque from behind at the Buffalo blue
line, less than three minutes after he'd been sent off for charging
the Boston captain.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque crumpled to the ice, Zhitnik was called for boarding,
and McLaren began a long-distance exchange of pleasantries as
Fraser restrained Zhitnik while ushering him off to serve his
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a dirty hit on Ray,'' said Burns. ``That's what I
think.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque became well acquainted with such attention while serving
as the Sabres' favorite fodder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I turned my back,'' said Bourque, ``they'd be
coming. There were some cheap shots there, but it's a long
series.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the biggest part of our hockey team,'' said teammate Rob
DiMaio. ``They know that and came after him. Everyone here has to
respond to that, but respond in the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhitnik, by now well versed in the art of proclaiming innocence,
felt the response was excessive. At least for the second
transgression.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first hit was dirty,'' he said. ``I got him from behind.
The second hit, he didn't see me, then went down like I hit him
real hard. I wasn't hitting him from behind. I pulled up. He didn't
say anything, but when I looked at him, he was smiling.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, he was alone in that regard because the crowd was
screaming for bloodlust and McLaren was eager to provide it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He yapped a little bit and I yapped a little bit,'' said
Zhitnik, smiling ever so benignly. ``As the referee skated me off,
he said he thought it was a questionable penalty, but it wasn't his
call.''
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit D: At 5:01 of the third period, McLaren took a couple of
jabs at the puck after Sabres goalie Dominik Hasek covered it with
his glove. Hasek took issue and took off after McLaren. His five
teammates on the ice beat him to it, forming a posse and menacingly
skating McLaren into a corner; the Bruins defenseman was fortunate
Hasek, trailing the parade, didn't have a rope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who it was, but he hit me twice with his stick,''
said Hasek. ``I was upset no penalty was called. A couple of times
before that, they had pushed at the puck after the whistle. I was
pretty upset.''
</P>
<P>
   The aggrieved parties had better get used to it, because
administering and absorbing punishment seems to be the cost of
doing business in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any game now is going to go from physical to hostile,'' said
Peca. ``In a seven-game series, you're going to see it. It's
nothing personal. It's going to get even worse.''
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the Bruins had better bring plenty of sutures and
ice packs to Buffalo.

ARE TEAMS DEVELOPING HATRED? CHECK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Kyle McLaren says he won't forget the hit Alexei
Zhitnik threw on his captain.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns called it ``a dirty hit.''
</P>
<P>
   And Byron Dafoe says it's something ``we'll remember heading
into Game 3'' in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   War hasn't been declared yet, but it became obvious Sunday at
the FleetCenter that these teams don't like each other and things
should get very interesting when this Eastern Conference semifinal
series between the Bruins and the Sabres resumes Wednesday tied at
a game apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's 3-1 Buffalo win was physical to be sure, and among the
star attractions were Zhitnik, who rang up 10 hits, and McLaren,
who had four, and took exception to the Zhitnik check on captain
Ray Bourque in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   It came at 17:12 in front of the Bruins bench and after Bourque
was hit, he went down in a heap and was slow getting to his feet.
Zhitnik was sent off for boarding, giving the Bruins a
five-on-three power play.
</P>
<P>
   McLaren was so incensed that he followed Zhitnik to the penalty
box, where he got into a shouting and finger-pointing match with
the Buffalo defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I said to him is stuff I probably can't repeat on the air
right now,'' said McLaren in his postgame interview with the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Hitting) is part of the game, but that hit was uncalled for.
It was kind of from behind and you just don't do that to guys like
Ray.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it, he's one of our best players and they're
going to hit him every chance they get. But don't hit him that way.
I was fortunate enough to be on the ice and get my words in there.
I'm not going to take a cheap shot at (Zhitnik) or what not, but .
. .''
</P>
<P>
   That incident was just one of three McLaren found himself in the
center of during the game.
</P>
<P>
   At 15:35 of the first period, he took a high stick from Vaclav
Varada to the corner of right eye. The play happened directly in
front of referee Kerry Fraser, who let it go. As play continued and
McLaren retreated to the bench, blood flowing from the gash, Burns
was ripping into Fraser. McLaren later returned sporting six
stitches.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at 5:01 of the third period, McLaren bore in on Buffalo
goalie Dominik Hasek, and poked at the puck that, McLaren says,
``was just sitting there.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Jay McKee, who, along with every Buffalo player on
the ice, including Hasek, went after McLaren in the corner. In
effect, just as he was telling Zhitnik earlier not to mess with
Bourque, they were telling him not to mess with Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   ``The puck was sitting there and the referee thought he had it,
but it was on the other side of his blocker,'' said McLaren. ``I
saw that and went in there after it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I did it after the whistle or before the
whistle, but the puck's there and I'm trying to put it in the net
and try and get this team going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider our team real chippy. I think we play hard
and play clean. It gets a little chippy out there every once in a
while and we have to stand up for ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we knew right from the start of this series that it
was going to be physical. But sticks are coming up and hits are
coming from behind and those are the things we have to respond to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray's a big guy and can stand up for himself, but when a hit's
uncalled for, well, we'll take care of each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the type of hits that aren't forgotten. They better
not be. I know I'm not going to forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   War hasn't been declared yet, but it certainly doesn't sound
like peace is at hand, either.

NO LOOKING BACK FOR NBA'S WELTS SINCE SONICS TITLE YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If humiliation wasn't sufficient, let's add historic
irony.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' absence from the playoffs comes at the 20-year
anniversary of the biggest deal in modern local sports, a peak
never reached again:
</P>
<P>
   An undisputed national championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' 1979 NBA title remains alone in the Puget Sound
sports pantheon, made even more lonely by this season's hoop
travails in which one of the championship-team members, Wally
Walker, is now held in contempt, if not custody, for failing to
return the lost glory.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonic president's plight is further evidence for the wisdom
in the axiom that you can't go home again.
</P>
<P>
   Another figure from that championship season has made the point,
too. Rick Welts was the club's public-relations man, who that
summer demonstrated an exquisite sense of timing by leaving the
Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   He never looked back, just up, and over the past two decades
became one of the most influential executives in sports.
</P>
<P>
   Now the sense of timing prevails again. As the NBA attempts to
recover from its recent self-slaughtering, Welts, whose 17 years in
the NBA front office made him the No. 3 power broker after David
Stern and Russ Granik, is moving on to head up something called Fox
Sports Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   The operation is in its infancy, but since his new boss is
Rupert Murdoch, the most powerful man in sports, odds are decent
that Welts in five to 10 years will be astride a sports-business
colossus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see the headline now: `Ex-Sonic ball boy makes good,'''
Welts said, laughing over the phone from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Welts joins the Fox empire July 1 in Los Angeles, where he has
been assured an office next to the studio where TV's ``Ally
McBeal'' is filmed.
</P>
<P>
   Having seen the program, this is not inspiring news. But Welts,
the NBA's executive vice president and chief marketing officer, is
recently familiar with lame show business, having been in full
cringe for a year as the NBA crashed and burned.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the personal side, it was the most difficult year we've
ever been through,'' he said. ``You couldn't tell what the next
one, two or three years of your life would be like. That takes a
toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we had a real resolve that if we get it right, we'll have
an extended period of growth. If we got it wrong, it will take a
long time to get it back.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA did get it right. The league crushed the union and the
agents, winning a hard salary cap and a rookie salary scale. The
tradeoff was a horrible half-season of hoops _ a deal owners would
make 10 times out of 10.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a human cost _ disillusionment and anger permeated
an enterprise once cited as an ideal operation for its turnaround
into America's trendiest sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of residual damage,'' he said. ``It's like any
other consumer-product business _ it can take years and years to
come back. But we tried to learn from other sports about how to
recover, and we've been pleasantly surprised the league came back
as quickly as it did.''
</P>
<P>
   The relatively minor drops in ratings and attendance signaled
again the gullibility of the American sports market as well as the
NBA's resilience _ partly due to the work of Welts, who was the
primary guy behind the NBA's marketing shrewdness.
</P>
<P>
   The Sporting News' annual ranking of the 100 most powerful
people in sports put Welts 77th, the only Seattle native on the
list besides Bill Gates (27) and Paul Allen (45). There is no
question about the top guy on the list _ Murdoch.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with his network's bold acquisition of NFL telecasts,
Murdoch's sports and TV empire is growing exponentially. Welts'
boss, Chase Carey, is Murdoch's right-hand man and sixth on the
power-broker list.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brands, logos and personalities he (Welts) helped create
and nurture have become universally known and respected,'' Carey
said. ``The events he pioneered, including the NBA All-Star
weekend, have become models for the sporting world.''
</P>
<P>
   The flip side is that the selling of the NBA's stars was cited
as the biggest problem in preventing a reasonable settlement,
because the players were convinced they were bigger than the game.
</P>
<P>
   But Frankenstein's basketball monster was then. The now in
Welts' life is overseeing Fox's non-TV interests in pro sports: the
Dodgers, the new Staples Center home for the Lakers and Clippers,
ownership shares in New York's Knicks, Rangers and Madison Square
Garden, plus hunting for fresh Murdoch meat.
</P>
<P>
   He'll conduct the fight in Los Angeles, the epicenter of a
corporate sports brawl between Fox and Disney, owners of the
Anaheim Angeles and NHL Mighty Ducks as well as ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tim Leiweke, president of the NHL Kings and the
Staples Center, ``What Rick has to do is figure out how to make
sense of all the pieces that Fox has _ and that's all Fox has now,
pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Welts, 46, loves a jigsaw puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could design a job not knowing whether it exists, this is
it,'' he said. ``Murdoch is one of the biggest TV players in the
world, and he knows that two things are guaranteed to bring viewers
to TV _ movies and sports. It's tried and true.''
</P>
<P>
   As a Sonics employee for a decade, it's good to see the gig can
ultimately get something more than a good booing.

<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ The Princeton Tigers grabbed the field by its
tail Sunday in the 54th edition of the Eastern Sprints on Lake
Quinsigamond.
</P>
<P>
   The heavyweights, defending national champions who finished
third here last year, covered a 2,000-meter course in 5:42.10 to
beat Brown (5:46.99) by a length. Following were Penn (5:48.91),
Wisconsin (5:49.26), Harvard (5:50.28), and Northeastern (5:54.88).
</P>
<P>
   The Princeton lightweights, defending Eastern Sprints and
national champions and headed to Henley in July, posted a 5:50.40
to beat sixth-seeded Columbia (5:52.12) by a half-length.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was Harvard (5:52.83), Rutgers (5:54.46), Yale
(5:55.53), and Georgetown (6:03.1).
</P>
<P>
   The Princeton heavyweights rowed their typical race, putting on
bursts at the 1,000- and 1,500-meter marks to get ahead and stay
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The race was all even after 500 meters. It was Princeton, Brown,
Wisconsin, and Penn after 1,000 meters, and then the Tigers took
off as if shot from a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Princeton coach Curtis Jordan said, ``We're not a fast-mover at
the start of any race. So we put in a game plan before the season
started and we stuck with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stayed close at the start of our race, make strong moves
after 500 and 1,000 meters, then got ahead and stayed ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was worried that all the crews got off to such a fast
start.
</P>
<P>
   ``That bothered me, because I was worrying about having enough
energy towards the end of the race,'' he said. ``My guys certainly
did. We rowed a perfect race.''
</P>
<P>
   The Princeton heavyweights will not go to Henley because some
oarsmen have duties with national teams and some will go to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will stay together until the IRAs, then disband,'' Jordan
said. ``It has been a fun season. We have five new oarsmen this
year, and they all did well.''
</P>
<P>
   Princeton lightweight coach Jim Murtaugh said, ``It was a great
race. We have everyone back from last year except two oarsmen and
we had a great season. We weren't top-seeded here but we had to
earn this championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Princeton had won all its regular-season races by open water and
that streak ended because of gallant efforts by Columbia and
Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some great crews around this season and you can't take
anything for granted,'' said Murtaugh. ``We had to make a total
team effort and we did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard freshman heavyweights were 8-0 entering Sunday's
race and won by a half-length over Brown _ 5:55.20 to 5:57.88.
</P>
<P>
   First-year Harvard coach Bill Manning, a 1986 Holy Cross grad,
said, ``We're relatively small, averaging 6 feet 2 1/2 inches and
180 pounds, but we have quality people.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard was pushed by Brown and Princeton at the start, then by
Brown alone over the last 500 meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel relaxed until there were 15 strokes to go,''
said Manning. ``Then I knew we had it. We rowed well from start to
finish.''

FASSERO'S 7-INNING EFFORT GOES FOR NAUGHT AGAINST YANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With his starters averaging 52/3 innings per outing
and his bullpen depleted and ragged, Mariners manager Lou Piniella
sat in his office Sunday and said, hopefully, ``I'd like to see
Fassero go seven innings today. Seven or eight. Then give the ball
to Mesa.''
</P>
<P>
   The M's got just what Piniella ordered _ sort of. Jeff Fassero,
their No. 1 starter, worked seven innings, then gave way to closer
Jose Mesa. It was the longest outing by a Mariner starter in more
than a week, but all it got the M's was a 6-1 loss to the New York
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero (1-4) was starting on three days' rest as the Mariners
began their plan to go with a four-man rotation for the next month.
He allowed five runs on seven hits and six walks in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter touched him for a two-run homer in the first, and
after three innings the Yankees were ahead, 4-0. At that point,
Fassero took a different approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody talks about mechanics so much,'' Fassero said.
``After three innings, I said, `(Forget) mechanics, just throw the
ball over the plate.' Danny (Wilson) said my sinker started moving
a lot more, my fastball in was driven in, my slider and forkball
were a lot sharper. I'm just going to go off the last four innings
and see if that gets me going.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero's next start will be on the usual four days' rest, and
with an off-day every week for the next six weeks, the Mariners
will need him to start on three days' rest only twice.
</P>
<P>
   Their other starters, Jamie Moyer, Freddy Garcia and Mac Suzuki,
also will have just two starts on three days' rest. Piniella said
he will arrange the rotation so left-handers and right-handers
alternate.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Brett Hinchliffe, who will be recalled from Class
AAA Tacoma Monday, figures to work in long relief after making a
spot start Monday night in Boston. The Mariners likely will send
down a reliever to make room for Hinchliffe, leaving them with a
six-man bullpen to back up the four-man staff.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero's counterpart Sunday Mike Stanton, made his first major
league start after 552 relief appearances because scheduled starter
Ramiro Mendoza was sick. Stanton broke the old record of 443
appearances before starting for the first time, set by San
Francisco's Gary Lavelle in the 1970s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   It was unorthodox, but the strategy worked. Stanton pitched four
strong innings, though Wilson's third-inning double dashed hopes of
another Beanie Baby Day-perfect game at Yankee Stadium, which David
Wells did last year.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton's shutout, however, remained intact when home plate
umpire John Hirschbeck called Wilson out at home after two-out
single by Brian Hunter. Replays clearly showed Wilson slid around
Jorge Posada, slapping home plate before Posada tagged him. Wilson
slammed his helmet to the ground after being called out. Third base
coach Steve Smith was ejected in the argument that followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was safe,'' Wilson said. ``(Hirschbeck) thought I
slid past it and was tagged before my hand got there.''
</P>
<P>
   Things got so desperate for the Mariners, Piniella came out
after the sixth inning and told Hirschbeck he believed the Yankees'
Jason Grimsley was doctoring the ball. Piniella said he noticed
Posada had flipped third-out strikeouts into the stands in the
fifth and sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grimsley was doing something to the ball,'' Piniella said.
``The last two innings he pitched, he wasn't. But the first two, he
was. His pitching coach, (Mel) Stottlemyre, can teach a sinker, but
not that kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella said Hirschbeck told him, ``Boy, if someone had that
type of sink on the ball, he could win 20 games.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He came out the last two innings and mixed his pitches,''
Piniella said. ``He still pitched well, but not with the movement
he had before.''
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley, a journeyman who has enjoyed a renaissance with New
York, struck out five and allowed one run to move his record to
4-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I throw the ball, and the ball sinks,'' said Grimsley, who
said Hirschbeck never talked to him. ``It's always sunk. I've just
never been able to throw it over the plate. I take (the Mariners'
suspicions) more or less as a compliment, because that tells me my
ball is moving more or less the way I want it to.''

INDIAN TRIBES CULTIVATE TRADE OPPORTUNITIES OVERSEAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BETTY BEARD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Judy Chavarria-Ferreira, a San Carlos Apache, was attending
a 1995 international forestry conference in Canada, she repeatedly
posed for pictures for German, French and Japanese delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners were fascinated by her Native American heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're from half a world away, and they heard a lot about us.
It makes you feel good. A lot of people there know a lot about
Indians, perhaps more than in the United States,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now American Indians are hoping to translate that mystique into
profits.
</P>
<P>
   The Intertribal Agricultural Council of Billings, Mont., which
represents 52 tribes, has begun promoting Native American products
at international agricultural trade shows, beginning with one last
October in Paris and another last month in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been incredibly surprised at the interest overseas,''
said Greg Smitman, executive director of the council.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great deal of interest in the whole concept of
Indians and the fact that they are original growers of staples like
corn, beans and potatoes. We sell on that basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the richest agricultural history is in Arizona, with
the Pimas and Tohono O'odhams growing crops for thousands of years.
If we can make that point clear overseas, it will help with the
marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   The world-famous Pima Indian cotton, for example, was developed
in 1908 on the Gila River Reservation as a desert-hardy version of
Egyptian cotton. Today it's used to make expensive, silky fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   Ardell Ruiz, assistant community manager for the Gila River
Indian Community south of Phoenix, traveled on European trade
missions to promote Gila River products and saw for himself how
marketable being an American Indian can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're curious. They'd say, `You really are real.' It seems
to add to the product,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A board member of the Intertribal Agricultural Council, Ruiz
said Europe and Japan could provide renewed markets for tribes
struggling to make a business out of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more interest abroad than in the United States,'' said
Ruiz, although no major sales contracts have yet been signed by
foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, some tribes that raise durum wheat for pasta are
able to get premium prices abroad, Ruiz said. In the United States,
they face stiff competition from Midwestern farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Chavarria-Ferreira, who is the council's Southwestern outreach
specialist, visits about 100 tribes in the Southwest. What she sees
is a mixture of progressive tribes selling through organized
agricultural co-ops and those lacking phones, computers or even
paved roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times they don't have push or incentive. They don't know
how to get from A to B,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of the Agricultural Council's work is teaching Native
Americans that their products have value and how to market them
better, especially overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most tribes don't market. They just sell. Indians tend to be
isolated,'' Smitman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to open new market avenues to increase the value
. . . We hope we'll get more successful at marketing, which is a
new thing to us.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the council developed a patented logo and two
trademarks, ``Made by American Indians'' and ``Produced in Indian
Country.'' Qualified tribal businesses use both for free.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the marketing campaign also is to get the word out that
American Indians produce a number of premium products, such as
white corn, beans, wild rice, olives and cotton.
</P>
<P>
   The Gila River tribe grows an especially sweet Valencia orange
on land with well-drained sandy soil with high sodium content and
perfect temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the unique climate and methods to grow them, we
believe they can achieve a higher price if they sell to Europe or
Japan,'' Smitman said.
</P>
<P>
   The community also raises olives. At the trade missions, he said
visitors dipped bread into the olive oil to taste it and seemed to
like its distinct flavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised because Spain produces so much olive oil. They
had big containers. But ours tastes totally different from those of
other countries,'' Ruiz said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Ak-Chin Indian Community produces pecans that could be
sold abroad, said Leona Kakar, tribal chairwoman. ``That would be
something we could market. It's not a perishable that will spoil
sitting somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Exporting agricultural products, of course, is not easy. It's
complicated by regulations, trade wars and the expense of
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The Navajo Agricultural Products Industry in Farmington, N.M.,
exports alfalfa, beans and potatoes grown on the Navajo Reservation
to Mexico, but it took a while to learn about fees, regulations,
contracts and the need for trust, said LoRenzo Bates (EDITOR:
CORRECT SPELLING)), general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Before NAPI considers exporting to Europe, he wants to make sure
the revenue compensates for shipping costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we have a market in the U.S. We have no problem
moving it. If we are convinced we can make more money in exporting,
then we would definitely do it. But it all comes down to the
almighty dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   The council also is working to make sure American Indians aren't
selling their products too cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Chippewas in Minnesota gather wild rice to sell
locally for about 50 cents a bag, which Smitman estimates is about
one-twentieth the value. Choctaws and other Oklahoma tribes sell
beans in bags at local stands, and Oneidas in Wisconsin sell
specialty white corns locally.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not getting the value added with packaging and
labels,'' Smitman said.
</P>
<P>
   Some products face bigger hurdles than marketing, however. The
San Carlos Apaches raise registered cattle and horses that draw
buyers from as far away as Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans, though, are very nervous about buying American cattle
because of fears of the hormones, antibiotics and steroids used to
make the livestock grow faster and keep them healthy.
</P>
<P>
   But Smitman said this provides American Indians the opportunity
to raise chemical-free beef. Tribes in Oklahoma, for example, have
enough land to let cattle graze and grow naturally instead of being
stuffed into feed lots and pumped with steroids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not land poor. We don't need 10,000 cows on 40 acres,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now American Indians are turning to Europe for the respect
they've often been denied in their own country, a move
Chavarria-Ferreira considers ironic.
</P>
<P>
   A Yakima man told her that, as he looked down from an airplane
while flying to Europe, he remembered that it was Europe that
produced many of the early pilgrims to America.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came here to find a better way of life, and now we're
going there to improve our lives,'' she said. &QL;

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ When you are bigger than life like Shaquille
O'Neal, it only makes sense that soon you begin to believe anything
is possible.
</P>
<P>
   And soon, like in the heart-gripping seconds it takes a
320-pound, 7-1 monster player like you to chase down Cuttino
Mobley, it becomes apparent that almost anything is.
</P>
<P>
   You can do it all, and you know it. You revel in the monster
image and expectations of being the scariest, most dominant big man
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   You call the energy drinks you down before every game ``diesel
fuel.'' You chest-bump teammate Ruben Patterson during pre-game
introductions, and he crumbles to the ground like a rag doll,
laughing at your strength.
</P>
<P>
   You embrace the aura that surrounds you _ the beautiful people
telling you how great you are; the blaring songs singing your name;
the record producers, movie executives and stars from here to Jack
Nicholson parading in front of you asking for autographs and
handshakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a unique player,'' O'Neal said. ``I know I do unique
things.''
</P>
<P>
   You love the way greatness fits you and how you are feared on a
basketball court. You are a phenomenon. You are the Diesel. Shaq
Daddy. Superman.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, anything seems possible.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why Game 1 of this Rockets-Lakers playoff series
Sunday showed us everything we need to know about this remarkable
player.
</P>
<P>
   It's scary how he can win a game almost by himself. It's equally
scary how he can nearly lose it by himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate missing free throws,'' O'Neal said. ``I felt bad about
how I shot them today.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal proved to be everything Hollywood loves to love in the
Lakers' 101-100 win at the Great Western Forum. He was huge inside,
offensively and defensively, constantly making plays that boggle
the mind.
</P>
<P>
   But he also again showed the tragic flaw in his game _ a 5-of-14
touch that is to free-throw shooting what Kazaam was to cinema.
</P>
<P>
   One moment, O'Neal was running a fast break like Magic Johnson
and finishing it with an alley-oop pass to Kobe Bryant. He was
spinning on the Rockets' Hakeem Olajuwon for a huge dunk and
lofting a soft one-hander over Charles Barkley in the waning
moments of this tough game.
</P>
<P>
   But he also was clanging a pair of misses from the free-throw
line with 3:38 remaining, keeping the game tied as the crowd
groaned.
</P>
<P>
   With 28 seconds left, he was hitting only one of two from the
line, keeping the Rockets up 100-99 and causing Lakers coach Kurt
Rambis to run his fingers through his hair in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   But then, there he was making the game-saving play after Bryant
hit a pair of go-ahead free throws with five seconds left. O'Neal
sealed the Lakers' victory when he perfectly defended the Rockets'
last-gasp pick-and-roll play, forced Mobley into an awkward
baseline shot and blocked it into the seats as the buzzer sounded.
</P>
<P>
   He screamed and hugged four of his teammates at once. Shaq
Daddy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phenomenal,'' Rambis said of his superstar.
</P>
<P>
   And phenomenal he was, at least in the images that will linger
in Lakers minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq has been ridiculed and criticized a lot for not defending
that play,'' Lakers guard Derek Fisher said of the game-winner.
``Lo and behold, they run a pick-and-roll in the last seconds, and
Shaq wins it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said O'Neal, mumbling into the cameras: ``I've got so many great
highlights I don't know if I've ever blocked a shot (for the win)
before. But I admit I've been a matador before on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Lo and behold, it's the Lakers up 1-0 going into Tuesday night
at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   But Shaq nearly lost this one, too. And that's why so long as
O'Neal is on the floor, anything remains possible in this series.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he was concerned about O'Neal's numerous misses
from the line, Rambis scowled. He paused, shrugged and then
announced, ``Yeah, we're not going to play him next game.''
</P>
<P>
   But of course O'Neal will play. He'll dominate. He'll clang free
throws and get hacked and chopped on. That's why anything remains
possible.
</P>
<P>
   That's why in every close game that ensues in this series,
Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich will continue to substitute Antoine
Carr and Stanley Roberts like hired guns in the critical moments,
with O'Neal in their sights.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal will be fouled, fouled often and fouled on every critical
possession. Then he'll step up to the line for those flat free
throws of his and hope they don't bounce off iron so many times the
Rockets couldn't help but win.
</P>
<P>
   He truly is bigger than life. He swings big and misses big.
Anything remains possible.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Rockets had done everything they were
supposed to. They had run down the to-do list as if completing
Sunday errands. Charles Barkley and Hakeem Olajuwon took turns
dominating. The rookies stepped up. They had the lead and the
basketball and a few more seconds to burn.
<TEXT>
<P>
   All that was left to check off was the last line: Don't fall
down in the last eight seconds. The Rockets did not hit the wall
with the game on the line. They ran into the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen crashed with 7.6 seconds left, handing the Lakers
the ball and a last chance to steal the win. Sam Mack then fell
into a two-guard pileup with Kobe Bryant, giving the Lakers the
free throws that became a 101-100 win to begin their Western
Conference first-round playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't steal one,'' Pippen said. ``We gave the game
away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets' last chance was snuffed out at the buzzer when
Cuttino Mobley dashed around an Olajuwon pick, flying past guard
Derek Fisher. But with Mobley leaning back to arch his shot over
Robert Horry, Shaquille O'Neal closed from behind to smash the ball
into the crowd, joining it to shout and high-five with the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what they were trying to do,'' O'Neal said. ``I told
Fish to just stay with him and I would take care of the inside.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Rockets having blown the road win that could have given
them early control of the best-of-five series, it was not the last
big shot they lamented. It was the one that got away, and the one
the Lakers never had to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we gave this game away,'' Barkley said. ``That's a
no-brainer. We got the lead and the ball, and you turn it over.
That's frustrating. We just turned the ball over. I'm not going to
blame anybody. You can't turn the ball over like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But if he were willing to point a finger, it would have had to
go across the locker room to his friend who could not get Barkley
the ball in the last seconds. Barkley had scored 12 of his 25
points in the fourth quarter, toying with J.R. Reid until he fouled
out and manhandling Horry.
</P>
<P>
   The only break in Barkley's dominance was when he used it to
attract double teams to pass outside to the Rockets shooters who
had reversed a horrible first half to carry the team back from an
11-point halftime deficit to control of the game.
</P>
<P>
   But after O'Neal made one free throw with 28.4 seconds left,
pulling the Lakers within one, Pippen found himself with the ball
with the shot clock running out. Barkley was on the block with
Horry on his back. Mack was on the wing. Pippen tried the first
steps of a drive but dribbled his legs out from under him. As he
smacked the court, the ball squirted to Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was tripped,'' Pippen said. ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mack was sure about the next play. With only a few seconds
to shoot, the Lakers went to Bryant, who shook his hips and headed
for the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't any contact,'' Mack said. ``He tripped over his
own foot. He tripped. I felt him falling. He reached out a little
to try to catch himself. I tried to get out of the way. I didn't
want any contact. He fell over me.''
</P>
<P>
   Official Ted Bernhardt hesitated, then called a foul on Mack.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant tagged the move ``the Philly Shake.'' But if naming his
moves or getting the ball on the last possession when three
starters had outscored him did not indicate Bryant's growing star
power, getting the call might have.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what that was, don't you?'' Pippen said. ``That was a
Michael Jordan call.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pippen did not blame the refs or his turnover as much as he
pointed to mistakes and to a Barkley decision. Pippen's was not the
only late turnover. With the Rockets holding a 97-96 lead, Mobley
looked for Mack on the basic Barkley post-up play. Mack had said
that if Glen Rice overplayed him, he would curl to the baseline,
instead of out on top. But Mobley did not get the message, looked
for Mack in the usual spot and let the ball slip away with 1:17
left.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher grabbed the ball, was fouled and made both free throws
for a 98-97 LA lead. Lakers coach Kurt Rambis moved Reid off
Barkley to Olajuwon, who immediately planted Reid with a spin move,
fouling him out and giving the Rockets a 100-98 lead with 1:03
left.
</P>
<P>
   Rice (29 points) airballed a wide-open 3. But when Olajuwon
missed an 18-footer from the baseline, O'Neal grabbed the rebound
and Barkley fouled to put O'Neal on the line.
</P>
<P>
   A notoriously dreadful free-throw shooter, O'Neal had made 54
percent this season, finishing well from the line. But when Barkley
hacked him, O'Neal had made just four of 13, his five second-half
misses helping the Rockets' comeback.
</P>
<P>
   With 28.4 seconds left, O'Neal missed his first. And though he
made the second, the Rockets had the lead and 28 seconds to hold
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did what we wanted to do,'' Barkley said. ``Every time Shaq
got the ball, we were going to foul him, and that gave us a big
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pippen chastised Barkley for fouling too soon, and for that
matter, for fouling him at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think the foul we gave Shaq at 28 seconds, when we
were up two points, was a very smart move,'' Pippen said. ``We
should have made them come down and have to work to score, at least
take the time off the clock. That was our biggest enemy right then,
to take some time off the clock. They got to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're up two points, and we just allowed them to (cut the lead
in half) and they get the ball back because we now have to do
something on the other end. We gave them the opportunity, and he
put us in a position where we had to score. We just put our back to
the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Down one game in the series, the Rockets are not there yet. But
they can see that wall closing in as clearly as the floor had in
the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some mistakes were very costly,'' Olajuwon said. ``We cannot
afford those kind of mistakes. It was a golden opportunity. This
was a great opportunity, and we lost it. We gave it away.''
</P>

BARKLEY HOLDS HIS TONGUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ When the subject happens to be the Los Angeles
Lakers, Charles Barkley is the anti-hype.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the NBA has chided the team itself and those who are
fascinated by the vogue, photogenic Lakers their fans, the media,
themselves more often than Sir Charles. To do anything else would
be uncivilized.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday afternoon, Charles was forced to hold his tongue, not
because the Lakers impressed him thoroughly or because he is ready
to annoint Kobe Bryant as the NBA's new king, but because his
Houston Rockets hand-delivered the mother of all Mother's Day
gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets had the ball, a two-point lead and less than a
minute on the clock in the first game of the best-of-five
first-round playoff series, and somehow managed to lose. Their
final 30 seconds featured an airball, two stumbles, a touch foul
and the debut of new Lakers point guard Shaquille O'Neal, and it
was all bad for Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The 101-100 Lakers win won't go in anyone's scrapbook but will
count for the Lakers as they aspire to higher NBA playoff ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was obviously a gift,'' said Barkley, irked yet calm in
the Rockets' dressing room. ``It is very disappointing to give them
this game. Three turnovers in the last 90 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very tough game to lose. We played what I thought was
pretty much a perfect game until then. Our game plan was good. We
wanted to foul Shaq and make him shoot free throws, and we did
(Shaq was 5 for 14 from the line). They didn't limit me much today
(25 points, 10 rebounds). They don't match up well against us.
</P>
<P>
   ``But all that counts is that they won.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were content to take it. Their post-mortem didn't
talk about who gave them a gift as much as how well they handled
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see what it takes to win, and that's on the defensive
end,'' said guard Derek Fisher, who had the presence to dive for a
Scotty Pippen turnover with seven seconds left and call timeout
while prone. ``If we can continue to do that, we'll win, and it
won't matter whether it's by one point or 20.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. The Lakers may go on to close out the NBA's oldest team
and Charles' mouth in the process, but their effort didn't win many
new admirers or scare any future opponent. Their flaws as a team
were still littered all over the Forum Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice, for example, scored 29 points, but none of them came
in the game's final 10 minutes. It was his air ball from the top of
the key that gave the Rockets the ball to go with their lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers won despite not scoring a field goal in the last four
minutes. Their last nine points came from the free throw line.
</P>
<P>
   They tossed a half-dozen defenders at Barkley J.R. Reid, Robert
Horry, Rick Fox, Sean Rooks, Shaq and even Kobe on some switches
and no one came close to stopping the 36-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers won because because Pippen stumbled and lost
possession driving on Bryant, and Fisher recovered; because Sam
Mack stumbled guarding Kobe and drew a foul as Kobe drove over him;
and because Shaq, moving better than a 325-pounder should be
allowed, shadowed guard Cuttino Mobley off a pick on the game's
final play and stuffed his baseline attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was phenomenal,'' said coach Kurt Rambis. ``They were
going to pick-and-roll, and Shaq did a great job helping out those
hung up on the pick. He just followed the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the truncated season began, Barkley looked at NBC's
schedule and howled at the number of exposures the Lakers were
getting. Charles has nothing against any one in L.A., but he voiced
the obvious point that a team should have won something to become
the chosen one.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was giving the Lakers the title, Barkley said then,
even though they're not even the best team in their conference. A
few days after the Rice-for-Eddie (Jones) and Elden (Campbell)
trade, Barkley lit into the Lakers again, saying a team with an
erratic defense had just traded away its best defensive player and
their only big forward.
</P>
<P>
   At least in this series, the Lakers miss Campbell (not to
mention Dennis Rodman), who was always big enough to guard guys
like Barkley. Their defense of late has been better than it was
most of April, but they still miss Jones' ability to harass
shooters. Mack made all three of his 3-point shots in the second
half Sunday, allowing the Rockets to overcome an 11-point halftime
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what the Lakers have accomplished lately is suspicious.
They closed the season with four wins, but two of those came
against non-playoff teams and two against a Portland team that
peaked in March. They were 2-5 in the seven games before that, with
both wins over non-playoff teams and three losses by 22 points or
more.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Sunday's game, to be followed by game two
Tuesday. ``This loss won't take a thing out of us because we're a
veteran team,'' said Barkley. ``This was obviously disappointing,
but I've been through worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Charles and the Rockets have perhaps the oddest streak
in the league working against them. They have now lost 14 straight
games that were televised by NBC, a streak that goes back to
February of 1998 and includes eight games this season.
</P>
<P>
   This may have an impact on Barkley's post-NBA sportscasting
career. For now, it's merely a streak he would like to break so he
can revive his monologue about the Lakers.

STOCK GIFT WILL HELP GROUP BUY, PROTECT WILDERNESS AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Environmentalists working to purchase and preserve a
wilderness area in north-central Washington will announce on Monday
a multimillion-dollar gift in stock that, along with grass-roots
fund raising, puts them halfway to their goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Loomis Forest Fund, launched to protect 25,000 acres of
rugged and pristine state-owned land near the Canadian border, aims
to raise $13 million by July 1 to purchase the forest and protect
it from planned logging.
</P>
<P>
   The Loomis Forest, a largely roadless area in northern Okanogan
County, is a popular recreation area that is host to numerous
wildlife species, including grizzly bear and the largest U.S.
population of Canada lynx in the lower 48 states.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Munson, campaign director for the Loomis Forest Fund, said
he and others will announce on Monday that an anonymous donor has
contributed to the effort by donating stock worth millions. They
won't reveal the company, except to say it's local, or the current
stock price because it could identify the donor, who wishes to
remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great, but also kind of ulcer-generating because the
stock fluctuates so wildly,'' said Mitch Friedman, executive
director of the Northwest Ecosystem Alliance and one of the leaders
in the drive to protect Loomis Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman said the plan is to sell the stock as soon as it makes
sense to do so to help pay for the land acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had more than 3,000 donors, so it's not just Microsoft
millionaires we're talking about,'' added Munson. He said donations
vary in amount, but the average per donor has been about $950.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this really shows is that when it comes to protecting our
wilderness, people really reach deep,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The group also is looking to the Washington Legislature to reach
deep during this upcoming special session to help make the land
transfer happen. Advocates of the sale, which include state Public
Lands Commissioner Jennifer Belcher, say the state will recoup more
money from the transfer of ownership than from selling logging
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly the best use of this land,'' Friedman said.
The state has already agreed to the sale if the money can be raised
by the July deadline, he noted, but he wants the Legislature to
pitch in because this constitutes a public benefit on a number of
fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman, a former tree-sitting and occasionally incarcerated
member of the radical group Earth First!, is now executive director
of Northwest Ecosystem Alliance and one of the prime movers behind
this market-based approach to saving wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   It's a switch in tactics for folks like Friedman, whose
organization earlier filed a series of lawsuits aimed at preventing
the state from allowing logging. The lawsuits argued this would
further threaten the local population of Canada lynx, which the
federal government last year proposed to list as a threatened
species.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase proposed by the Loomis Forest Fund would not hurt
the state's Common School Construction Trust, which uses the sale
of logging rights on state land to finance public school buildings.
Friedman and Munson have agreed to give the trust money to buy
timberland of comparable value and they contend the sale will
provide the school fund with more money than it would get from
logging the Loomis Forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reason it hasn't been logged yet,'' Munson said. The
two largely roadless parcels they aim to protect are
higher-elevation forest land with skinny lodgepole pine trees of
the kind typically used for chipping into pulp, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing the Loomis fund purchase, Munson said, would preserve
wilderness, and the state would retain the right to allow
recreational use as well as grazing.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman said ranchers had threatened to sue to block the deal
if they were not allowed grazing rights.
</P>
<P>
   He said it's in the Legislature's interest to help pay for the
transfer as well because the school construction fund will get more
bang for the buck than if it simply went for logging. Friedman said
an independent appraisal estimated the school fund would receive
about $6 million if it sold logging rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We propose to get them twice that much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Friedman first proposed private purchases aimed at
protectingpublic timberlands, environmental allies were dubious if
not downright critical. Some felt he had abandoned his principles
and perhaps his common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think so,'' Friedman said. ``It's about trying do
whatever might work, about thinking outside the box.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he hopes the Legislature _ despite an extremely short
special session beginning a week from Monday _ can also think
outside the box and help fund a land transfer that protects both
the budgetary bottom line and the state's natural heritage.
</P>

NOTED ARCHITECTS ARE NOW LINING UP FOR SEATTLE CIVIC PROJECTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVEN GOLDSMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Seattle may be about to shed its reputation for cheap,
tacky and dull civic buildings _ or at least the cheap part.
</P>
<P>
   Noted architects are bringing their pencils to Seattle this week
to compete for the job of designing Seattle's $156 million Central
Library, to be followed by a similar contest next month for a $66
million City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Glancing up from their drawing pads, meanwhile, are the
architects already sketching out Seattle's $90 million municipal
Justice Center and $190 million Federal Courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The spree of civic projects has lured an unprecedented degree of
interest from major architects from outside the region to focus on
Seattle's downtown landscape and civic identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extraordinary time,'' said local architect Rick
Sundberg, chairman of the Seattle Design Commission. ``It's about
time we got out of our adolescence and assumed our place on the
Pacific Rim.''
</P>
<P>
   All but the federal courthouse project will replace modestly
priced 1960s government buildings widely deemed outmoded,
impractical and unsafe _ not to mention ugly.
</P>
<P>
   While the pieces are being designed one by one, knitting some of
the projects together is a three-block master plan conceived in
March by the Hewitt Architects and Weinstein Copeland firms. A
dramatic sloping plaza will link the new city government offices
with a subway station down the hill.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the master plan does not put to rest several unresolved
questions about the civic building boom:
</P>
<P>
   - Cost vs. benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Sticker shock shot through the City Council last week when Mayor
Paul Schell's staff stuck a $224 million price tag on the combined
construction and renovation of the three-block Civic Center.
</P>
<P>
   Paying for the complex _ building a City Hall and Justice
Center, renovating Key Tower and the Arctic Building, buying a
parking garage, landscaping the public plaza _ could suck up to $14
million out of the annual city budget.
</P>
<P>
   And that led City Councilman Nick Licata to demand the buildings
be pared in size. The desire to reverse Seattle's sorry public
architectural heritage, Licata said, must be balanced against
fiscal reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seattle got to be a great city even though we had a mediocre
City Hall,'' he said. ``Did it really cripple our future?''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping up the debt payments could become an ``albatross'' for
the city if tax revenues start dipping, Licata added.
</P>
<P>
   But budget analysts have convinced most of Licata's colleagues
that keeping the current crop of aging buildings wouldn't let the
city off the financial hook: They would cost $3 million more each
year to heat and operate than new ones would.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's going to be expensive but what are our
choices?''said council finance Chairwoman Martha Choe.
</P>
<P>
   Council members haven't ruled out trimming space from the City
Hall's reception areas and public-service counters. The proposed
$12 million outdoor plaza could also be pruned back.
</P>
<P>
   But Choe said it would be a mistake to cut corners so the new
buildings turn into future civic embarrassments.
</P>
<P>
   When Choe tells strangers she works in ``the ugly blue
building,'' they instantly know she means Seattle's Municipal
Building at Fourth and Cherry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't many opportunities in a city's life,'' Choe said,
``(when) you're given the opportunity to think about a new center
for a city.''
</P>
<P>
   - Outside vs. inside talent:
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Seattle's 1980s skyscraper boom left its own bold
imprint, and most of the towers were designed by large Northwest
firms.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Art Museum reversed the local bias when it pulled
post-modern star Robert Venturi to town, but the museum's
construction and interior flaws were later cited as reasons for
sticking close to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't necessarily get anything better than you can get at
home,'' said architect Dennis Forsyth, whose Seattle-based NBBJ
firm is designing both the federal and city courthouses.
</P>
<P>
   Only during the 1990s has the University of Washington gotten
into the habit of hiring East Coast talents such as Charles
Gwathmey, Cesar Pelli, Edward Larrabee Barnes and Peter Bohlin.
</P>
<P>
   Now downtown Seattle is in the world's gaze. Among the notable
international firms rejected for the library's short list last
month were those of Richard Meier (Getty Museum), Michael Graves
(Denver Library) and Moshe Safdie (Vancouver, B.C., Library).
</P>
<P>
   Some of the library rejects dusted themselves off to try for the
upcoming City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the 10-member City Hall architect advisory committee could
find itself torn. Schell has long spoken of preferring a local
architect. Councilman Peter Steinbrueck, on the other hand,
insisted everybody be considered.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrueck won at least the first round. Submissions came from
25 firms, many well-known internationally.
</P>
<P>
   Vivian Phillips, Schell's press secretary and a committee
member, said the mayor will base his final decision on talent, not
origins.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can even be from somewhere else,'' Phillips said, ``and
yet have a greater appreciation for what we represent in the
Northwest than someone who lives here.''
</P>
<P>
   - Pros and cons of ``process'':
</P>
<P>
   Instead of grilling five finalists for the Central Library job,
the library's selection committee will talk this week to just
three.
</P>
<P>
   That's because two finalists abruptly pulled out last week:
Cesar Pelli &AMP; Associates of New Haven, Conn., and Foster and
Partners of London.
</P>
<P>
   Pelli said Seattle's selection process was more than he
bargained for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just kept understanding more things about it,'' Pelli said
in an interview from New Haven. ``We love Seattle and we'd love to
be able to do a building there, so it was very difficult for us to
decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelli said he knew Seattle planned a three-day selection program
but didn't realize that meant all finalists would have to stay the
entire time. For Pelli, that added up to a full week away from his
other clients, with no assurance of getting the job.
</P>
<P>
   Pelli also found out after submitting the application that he
and the others would have to do a ``pop quiz'' _ a design
assignment _ to be given on Monday and turned in Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Norman Foster, who last month won architecture's coveted
Pritzger Prize, was more vague about his reason for withdrawing
from the Seattle competition, saying through a spokeswoman it was
because of ``current workload and commitments on other projects
worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   City librarian Deborah Jacobs said the pullout reflected no flaw
in the selection process, just a thriving global economy that
enables popular architects to pick and choose. She said the three
remaining finalists are exceptionally strong
</P>
<P>
   They'll present their works at a public forum Monday at Benaroya
Hall. The Library Board is to make its choice May 18.
</P>
<P>
   The finalists are:
</P>
<P>
   - Steven Holl, a Washington native now based in New York, who
designed the Museum of Contemporary Art in Helsinki and the
acclaimed Chapel of St. Ignatius at Seattle University.
</P>
<P>
   - Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Partnership of Portland and Seattle,
creators of the Bellevue Regional Library and the Oregon Convention
Center.
</P>
<P>
   - And the cutting-edge Office of Metropolitan Architecture,
based in the Netherlands, led by noted theoretician Rem Koolhaas,
who penned in his Seattle proposal a paean to ``the realness'' of
books in the computer age.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever gets chosen for the job will help create the
``realness'' of downtown Seattle's cityscape as it changes in the
next three years.

 SILICON VALLEY EMERGES AS A FORCE IN POLITICS  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI and MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Vice President Al Gore has visited California's
Silicon Valley dozens of times. He has raised millions of dollars
from technology leaders. He has been such a presence on high-tech
issues that he recently took credit for ``creating the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to his quest for the presidency in the year
2000, Gore hardly has Silicon Valley wired.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to political perceptions dating back to the early days
of President Clinton's administration _ when high-profile news
events like NetDay showcased the vice president's computer literacy
_ there is little evidence that the titans of the computer industry
favor Gore, or even the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, the socially liberal, sometimes offbeat
entrepreneurs who lined up with Clinton to push issues like
welfare-to-work and education reform, are being challenged by
business-minded, high-tech CEOs, whose libertarian leanings are
often more in line with the GOP's ``lower taxes, less government''
philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Those divided loyalties, coupled with the region's enormous
resources and symbolic richness, have transformed Silicon Valley
into one of the premier battlegrounds of the 2000 presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is going to be a battle royale in Silicon Valley,''
predicted Connie Correll, communications director at the
Information Technology Industry in Washington. ``Neither party has
a lock on the high-tech industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, when Silicon Valley took its first baby steps
organizing campaign money and endorsements, the region's industry
leaders have amassed such influence that candidates routinely
include Silicon Valley _ often at the expense of San Francisco _ as
a regular destination on their whistle-stop tours through the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians flock to hamlets of the South Bay to raise money,
pay homage and wrap themselves in the garb of the future. And so
President Clinton arrives Friday to scoop up campaign cash at a
Democratic National Committee fund-raiser. Gore is heading west
later this month, and a parade of Republican hopefuls including
front-runners Elizabeth Dole and George W. Bush are right behind
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing short of phenomenal,'' is the way Netscape head Jim
Barksdale recently described the industry's success in flexing its
political muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've held 150 events last year and raised millions of
dollars,'' he told industry leaders at a gala to celebrate the
success of the Technology Network, the Silicon Valley lobbying
powerhouse comprised of Republicans and Democrats. ``Not a week
goes by that we don't host several (political) people.''
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale, a Republican, and many of his Democratic colleagues,
sees a critical moment of truth approaching. The 2000 vote will be
the first campaign to reflect the full impact of the technology
community's political clout.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much has happened in one election cycle,'' said Wade
Randlett, the Democratic liaison to TechNet. In the last
presidential election, familiar companies like Yahoo, Amazon.com
and Netscape were mere startups, Randlett notes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Internet giants of Silicon Valley alone command a
staggering $365 billion in revenues _ and the wealth of high tech,
biotech and computer firms represents a 20 percent slice of the
American economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The valley's just growing up and starting to accept its
role,'' said Dave House, president of the Santa Clara-based Nortel
Networks, who demonstrated new communications equipment for GOP
presidential hopeful John Kasich on a recent campaign stop.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for Silicon Valley executives to attend political
meet-and-greets and roundtable discussions and to host political
candidates has mushroomed so much this year, House said, that ``you
could spend all of your time doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the issues important to tech leaders are classic big
business: protection from lawsuits, larger government subsidies and
an end to restrictions on imports. Others have a particular
high-tech twist, such as easing immigration caps to allow more
trained workers into the valley, or pushing education reform to
better train potential employees. The competition for high-tech
support has forced presidential candidates to become fluent in a
range of complex issues that dominate the valley's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, who first popularized the term ``information
superhighway'' two decades ago, computer literacy has long been a
strength, and much of the reason for his assumed advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president can navigate nuances of everything ``from
interoperability to complexity, to thermodynamics to scientific
inquiry and feudalism in the nation state ... to rocks, scissors
and paper,'' said prominent venture capitalist John Doerr, a
Republican who is nevertheless a trusted Gore loyalist.
</P>
<P>
   Some Silicon Valley leaders say that for the 2000 election,
computer literacy is not good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are a national leader, being technology-friendly
means more than logging on to the Net,'' said Robert Grady,
managing director at BancBoston Robertson Stephens in San Francisco
and a director of the Technology Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore does love California and Silicon Valley cash, but when he
comes to town to try to hit our wallets one more time, New Economy
voters might want to remind him that `love means never having to
say you're sorry.'''
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of the campaign contributions shows the tech
industry is deeply split on its presidential loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Gore has received about 40 percent of the donations from
the computer industry, barely beating Texas Governor George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a perception that Silicon Valley is Clinton-Gore
country, and that Gore is going to vacuum up all the
contributions,'' said Holly Bailey, of the Center for Responsive
Politics. ``Judging from contributions so far, that doesn't seem to
be the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey credits Republicans with having ``learned the Democrat's
secret in terms of Silicon Valley. Every other week we hear about
Republicans touring Silicon Valley or visiting a technology
company. ...They are going to these companies and saying, `We are
your party, we support your issues.'''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the computer industry contributed $8.8 million to
candidates and political parties during the 1997-98 election cycle,
according to a recent study by the nonpartisan campaign watchdog
group, with 57 percent going to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the key technology players, like Doerr, one of the
nation's biggest political donors, have put considerable resources
exclusively behind one party _ in his case, Al Gore. But increasing
numbers of tech bigwigs are hedging their political bets by
spreading around the largesse. Apple Computer co-founder Steve
Jobs, who has hosted President Clinton at his home for big
Democratic fund-raisers, recently put $1,000 on Bill Bradley, and
Novell CEO Eric Schmidt recently donated $2,000 each to rivals Gore
and Bush, campaign finance statements show. Larry Sonsini, the
Republican head of a Palo Alto tech firm and a big Bush donor, was
seen in April at Bill Bradley's $1,000-a-head San Francisco
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Silicon Valley has come to take on a significance far
beyond the mere financial _ or electoral _ influence of its
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real cache is in associating yourself with the industries
that represent our future,'' said Republican strategist Dan Schnur.
``A dollar from Silicon Valley doesn't count any more than a dollar
from anywhere else . . . (but) associating yourself in the public's
mind with these emerging technologies and emerging industries is a
huge political benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   That point was not lost on Kasich during his latest swing
through the South Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silicon Valley represents the bottom-up power of the
individual to change the world,'' the Ohio congressman said,
motioning out his car window at block after block of burgeoning
tech firms. ``(It's) about the individual having the power to make
the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that Al Gore invented the Internet,'' said Kasich, in
a not-so-subtle dig at the vice president's self-proclaimed tech
leadership. ``What we can offer is to keep the government's mitts
off this town.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, issues that matter to tech leaders _ many
of whom tend to favor Democrats _ that have almost nothing to do
with their bits and bytes existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silicon Valley is diverse,'' said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a Democrat
from San Jose. ``It's pro-environment, it's pro-choice, it's in
favor of substantial public investment in public education. . .
.You can't come in here as a Bible belter and cut it.''
</P>
<P>
   For political insiders, the race for the 2000 presidential
election is just beginning _ and like technology, the changes will
come fast and furiously.
</P>
<P>
   What's important, and lasting, tech leaders say, is that the
impact of the industry _ and the ``New Economy'' it helped create _
has been carved into the political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 political election will test efforts ``to build the
bridges between two communities that formerly didn't talk to each
other _ the political community and high tech,'' said Roberta Katz,
the new president of TechNet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have leaders from the Republican Party and the
Democratic Party who all want to embrace and advance the New
Economy,'' said Doerr. ``That's a big victory.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Poison in our land
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   An admired movie actor, aging but still a commanding presence,
addresses the annual meeting of the National Poison Association, of
which he is president:
</P>
<P>
   Fellow NPA members, it is a pleasure to be with such righteous
and patriotic Americans, a wholesome change from the time that I
have to spend with the whiners of this country just to defend our
basic right to own the poisons of our individual choice.
</P>
<P>
   As you know, the threats to that right have been growing. We
have a president who believes some poisons should be outlawed. He
wrongly argues that the inevitable fatality and fast action of some
of the newer ones somehow make them fundamentally different from
the old poisons. And he would have the government regulate even the
poisons that can take hours to work and for which antidotes are
available in most communities.
</P>
<P>
   Special-interest organizations are misrepresenting poisons and
defaming the good people who account for the overwhelming majority
of poison owners.
</P>
<P>
   These organizations say that the easy availability of poisons is
the cause of poison deaths and illnesses. We are, all of us,
saddened by such tragedies, but it would be wrong to penalize the
law-abiding majority of poison owners for the misuse that a
criminal few make of a substance that, after all, can commit no
crimes on its own.
</P>
<P>
   We of the NPA have long worked with law enforcement officials to
fight criminal poisonings. We support mandatory and longer prison
terms for persons who use poison in a crime. We spend more money
than any other organization teaching children to respect poisons
and we conduct workshops that show children how to use poisons
safely. The NPA is proud of its Poison Buddies program _ you've
seen its lovable mascot, Vinnie Vulture _ which brings parents and
children together for fun outings at our Responsible Poisoning
Camps.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, if poisons are outlawed, only criminals will have
poisons. Tax-paying homeowners would be left defenseless against an
array of predators. These days, it's a woods out there! And the
surest way to stop the next young lady who thinks she's Lucrezia
Borgia is to remind her that the next guy she meets might be
packing poison himself. More poisonings are prevented by poison
than are committed with it.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in this vast room is appalled at the recent situation
in Smalltown, Iowa, where a man slipped strychnine into the water
system. Our hearts go out to the families. Some now call for
controlling strychnine, but the fault for this horrible crime lies
elsewhere. Smalltown, with a single guard at the reservoir, was
clearly negligent in its public safety duty, and the perpetrator of
this heinous act had been watching too much television. It is our
godless culture that really is poisoning us.
</P>
<P>
   I am pleased to accept a second term as your president. I will
not _ I will not! _ let the Smalltown tragedy lead to the
confiscation of your poisons or to requirements for safety caps.
Let me leave you with this _ and let us all say in unison: Poisons
don't kill people. Poisoners kill people.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; EVERYBODY WAS SO YOUNG: GERALD AND SARA MURPHY. A LOST &LR; 
GENERATION LOVE STORY. By Amanda Vaill. Broadway, $15. The Murphys
were a dazzling, rich American couple who knew and entertained just
about everybody who was anybody in Paris and on the French Riviera
in the 1920's, from Fitzgerald to Picasso. In 1998 our reviewer,
Brooke Allen, called this ``a marvelously readable biography'' by
``a skillful and compassionate writer.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ABOUT A BOY. &LR;  By Nick Hornby. Riverhead, $12.95. Will Freeman
is a smug but aimless London bachelor in his 30s who devises a
dating scheme to tap the market in sexy divorced women by
pretending to be a single dad and joining a support group full of
single mothers. Before long, though, he runs into a troubled
12-year-old boy who sees right through him, and the two become
unlikely soul mates. ``Hornby ... combines a skilled, intuitive
appreciation for the rigors of comic structure with highly original
insights about the way the enchantments of popular culture
insinuate themselves into middle-class notions of romance,'' Hal
Espen wrote here in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A WALK IN THE WOODS: REDISCOVERING AMERICA ON THE APPALACHIAN &LR; 
TRAIL. By Bill Bryson. Broadway, $13. The author chronicles in
breezy, good-humored fashion his five-month struggle to hike the
2,100-mile Appalachian Trail from Georgia to Maine. Bryson is ``a
satirist of the first rank, one who writes (and walks) with
Chaucerian brio,'' Dwight Garner wrote here last year.  &UR; SEARCHING &LR; 
FOR YELLOWSTONE: ECOLOGY AND WONDER IN THE LAST WILDERNESS, by Paul
Schullery (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $14), is an environmental and
human history of Yellowstone National Park by a longtime park
ranger and administrator. ``Schullery ... has given us a
refreshingly unhyperbolic look at the place he loves,'' Michael
Parfit wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FREEDOMLAND. &LR;  By Richard Price. Island/Dell, $7.99. This novel
tracks the racial turmoil that erupts after a white woman turns up
in a New Jersey city and claims her 4-year-old son was abducted by
a black carjacker. ```Freedomland' is infinitely more than a
detective story,'' Francine Prose said here last year. ``It aspires
to the heft and weight of a 19th-century Russian classic.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WORMHOLES: ESSAYS AND OCCASIONAL WRITINGS. &LR;  By John Fowles.
Owl/Holt, $16.
</P>
<P>
   This grab bag of musings by the 73-year-old English novelist
covers a lot of territory _ from autobiographical pieces to
cantankerous forays into politics and culture. ``The book is as
various, quirkily learned, beguiling, opinionated and, in parts, as
sumptuously written as Fowles' fiction,'' Roger Kimball wrote here
last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE IRON TRACKS. &LR;  By Aharon Appelfeld. Schocken, $12. This
Israeli novel is about a concentration camp survivor who wanders
through Austria buying sacred books and other remnants of the
Jewish culture that once flourished there while searching for the
Nazi officer who murdered his parents. ``Appelfeld's controlled
fiction compresses large themes into small spaces,'' Jonathan Rosen
said here in 1998.  &UR; BRONSTEIN'S CHILDREN &LR; , by Jurek Becker
(University of Chicago, $15), is another novel about the psychic
aftershocks of the Holocaust, in which an 18-year-old German Jew in
1973 stumbles onto his father and two other camp survivors as they
torture a former Nazi guard. ``Becker, writing simply and clearly
in an unstrained narrative, speaks with the voice of knowledge,''
Eva Figes said here in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE COLLECTED POEMS OF AMY CLAMPITT. &LR;  Knopf, $19.95. Clampitt's
poetry is full of restless motion and energy as she evokes places
like the Quaker village in Iowa where she was born and Greenwich
Village, where she cultivated a resolute bohemianism. In 1997 in
the New York Times Book Review, Christopher Benfey called this
posthumously published collection a testament to an ``extraordinary
life's work.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A BEAUTIFUL MIND. &LR;  By Sylvia Nasar. Touchstone/Simon &AMP;
Schuster, $16. This biography of John Nash, the Nobel Prize-winning
developer of game theory, follows him from his early career through
his crippling bouts of schizophrenia to his recovery years later.
The author, who writes about economics for The New York Times,
``offers a remarkable look into the arcane world of mathematics and
the tragedy of madness,'' Simon Singh wrote here in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GREEN FIRES: ASSAULT ON EDEN. A NOVEL OF THE ECUADORIAN &LR; 
RAINFOREST. By Marnie Mueller. Curbstone, $13.95. A former Peace
Corps volunteer revisits the jungles of coastal Ecuador on her
honeymoon in 1969 and becomes involved in a battle between the
native people and American oil companies. ``The characters are well
drawn, and the novel has adventure, intrigue and romance as well as
politics,'' one critic said in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HAVANA DREAMS: A STORY OF A CUBAN FAMILY. &LR;  By Wendy Gimbel.
Vintage, $13. The lives of three unhappy women _ a wealthy
bourgeoise, her daughter and the daughter's child by Fidel Castro _
provide a striking perspective on Cuba and its odd destiny. ``The
result is a shimmering book,'' Alma Guillermoprieto said here last
year.

requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending May 1 at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, May 9, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-SERBIA-REVIEW (Undated) _ A bold, if impractical,
question is just now beginning to be formulated: Is it finally time
for outside powers to crush Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
to make the effort necessary to cure a national psychosis inside
Serbia that has been destabilizing a corner of Europe for a decade?
Put another way, has the time come for NATO to do in Serbia what
the Allies did in Germany and Japan after World II? By Blaine
Harden. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   COLO-SHOOTING-ODDS-REVIEW (Washington) _ If there is anything
left to be said about the tragedy in Littleton, Colo., it may be
this: the cold, hard reality of the school massacre is that it was
the statistical equivalent of the proverbial needle in a haystack.
And, precisely because such events are so rare, and because it is
impossible to eliminate risk from life, there may be no larger
lessons to draw, and no way to prevent another one. By Sheryl Gay
Stolberg. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   NEWSMEDIA-DEATHS-REVIEW (Atlanta) _ The news media's philosophy
appears to be that while people may be created equal, they do not
necessarily die that way. On the swiftly calculated sliding scale
of death, disasters are assigned a news value based not on how many
lives were lost, but on how and where they happened to die. A
recent Arkansas boating accident that killed 13 people received far
less coverage than events that claimed a comparable number of
lives, such as an Amtrak crash or Colorado school shooting. By
David Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   CLEMENCY-POLITICS-REVIEW (San Francisco) _ It's a bad time to be
on death row. Politicians win points _ and votes _ by wearing the
tough-on-crime banner. In this environment, granting clemency has
become an act of courage that requires an outlay of political
capital few governors are willing to spend. In the current
political climate, clemency is nearly impossible. By Evelyn Nieves.
</P>
<P>
   GAMBLING-DOSTOYEVSKY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Among the problems to be
addressed or evaded in the coming report by the National Gambling
Impact Study Commission is the problem gambler. Some of the most
vivid accounts of gambling addiction in world literature come from
Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky, who for miserable years was an
unregenerate roulette punter in the casinos of Germany. By Walter
Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   ANIMAL-CRUELTY-REVIEW (Undated) _ For cats, dogs and other
animals, life in the movies is beginning to appear less than
glamorous. At this historical juncture of political correctness and
feeling the pain of others, pretending to hurt animals has become
an intentional laugh-getter in movies, TV and advertising. By
Douglas Martin.
</P>
<P>
   MILITARY-BOOKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The U.S.
military-literary-industrial complex is gathering might with the
surprising success of new books that portray modern warriors as
complex heroes who confront enemies and their own mistakes with a
mixture of courage and fear. By Doreen Carvajal.
</P>
<P>
   BBO-SCOUT-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Baseball scouting reports:
soft hands, bat-breaking kinks and other intimations of
immortality. Excerpts from scouting reports filed on players while
they were unknown amateurs.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-JOBLESS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Europe's cradle-to-grave
safety net means not only that being out of work has become a
viable way of making a living, but that there is no longer much
stigma attached to joblessness. That goes a long way in explaining
the contrast between America's current jobs boom and the
contrasting jobs bust in Europe. By Sylvia Nasar. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-DIVISIONS-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ Such depictions of Israeli
society as an aggregate of groups, not individuals, reflect the
hardening of social divisions here in recent years. More than ever,
Israelis view each other as members of ideological, religious or
ethnic sub-units, rather than as one society with shared values. By
Joel Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MONTENEGRO-REVIEW (Podgorica) _ Montenegro is unusually
hospitable to foreign journalists because the tiny republic is in
big trouble. Its new, Western-leaning government has all but pulled
out of the Yugoslav federation with Serbia. The Montenegrin
government is bending over backwards for foreign journalists
because it cannot allow the state-controlled Serbian media to
present the only images of what is actually happening. By Anthony
DePalma.
</P>
<P>
   EVEREST-REVIEW (Undated) _ Expeditions for climbing the world's
tallest peak have changed dramatically over the years. A look at
the different gear used in 1924, 1953 and 1999.

USING THE PRESS FOR PROTECTION IN MONTENEGRO 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Montenegro _ As soon as foreign reporters enter
Yugoslavia by one of the only routes still open _ into the
country's junior republic, Montenegro, by way of Albania _ a small
squad of heavily armed police officers is there waiting for them.
</P>
<P>
   The police immediately take the reporters into custody, but not
to kick them out of Yugoslavia. Rather they are there to escort
them safely into Montenegro's capital, Podgorica, where they are
invited to work in a modern press center complete with
long-distance telephone lines, fax machines, Internet connections
and access to top government officials.
</P>
<P>
   That special treatment is a far cry from the way most Western
correspondents were rounded up and forced out of Belgrade early in
the NATO bombing campaign. The reason for this hospitality is
simple: The tiny republic of Montenegro, only the size of
Connecticut, is in big trouble. Its new Western-leaning government
has pulled out of the federation with Serbia in all but name and
has refused to accept the declaration of war passed in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The independent foreign press is the last bastion in the
defense of Montenegro, along with our police units,'' said Abaz
Beli Dzafic, deputy secretary of Montenegro's Ministry of
Information. The ministry runs the press center in Podgorica and
coordinates a police team that provides escorts and occasionally
rescues journalists caught in roadblocks set up by the Yugoslav
Army, which has confiscated equipment from foreign reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav army positions in Montenegro have been bombed anyway.
NATO jets have damaged the airport in Podgorica as well as a bridge
on the border, causing a number of civilian deaths. The mayhem gave
the army and a segment of the political opposition _ which is
aligned with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic _ fuel with
which to attack the government of Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   The government says it is helping foreign journalists (more than
500 have received press credentials from the Ministry of
Information since the conflict began) to prevent the
state-controlled Serbian media from presenting the only images of
what is actually happening here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine what would happen if NATO had no information
from Montenegro and it notices some anti-aircraft fire coming from
the ground,'' said Deputy Prime Minister Dragisa Burzen. ``Instead
of understanding it was just an attempt by the army to incite
trouble, NATO might believe that the government is no longer in
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps uniquely in the Balkans, Montenegro has a tradition of
independent journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure is horrible because we've got that constant
feeling that the army can grab you any time you go out on the
street,'' said Milka Tadic, the managing editor of The Monitor, a
weekly newspaper with a circulation of 10,000. The government has
provided protection for Monitor employees and has pledged to
support their efforts to continue publishing, even though many of
the paper's articles are also critical of the current government.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they have a reason to protect us,'' Ms. Tadic said. ``We
can say much more about what is going on in Serbia than the
state-owned media. We are openly writing about ethnic cleansing in
Kosovo and about the moves by the army of occupation here.''

Connecticut, is in big trouble. Its new Western-leaning government
has pulled out of the federation with Serbia in all but name and
has refused to accept the declaration of war passed in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The independent foreign press is the last bastion in the
defense of Montenegro, along with our police units,'' said Abaz
Beli Dzafic, deputy secretary of Montenegro's Ministry of
Information. The ministry runs the press center in Podgorica and
coordinates a police team that provides escorts and occasionally
rescues journalists caught in roadblocks set up by the Yugoslav
Army, which has confiscated equipment from foreign reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav army positions in Montenegro have been bombed anyway.
NATO jets have damaged the airport in Podgorica as well as a bridge
on the border, causing a number of civilian deaths. The mayhem gave
the army and a segment of the political opposition _ which is
aligned with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic _ fuel with
which to attack the government of Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   The government says it is helping foreign journalists (more than
500 have received press credentials from the Ministry of
Information since the conflict began) to prevent the
state-controlled Serbian media from presenting the only images of
what is actually happening here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine what would happen if NATO had no information
from Montenegro and it notices some anti-aircraft fire coming from
the ground,'' said Deputy Prime Minister Dragisa Burzen. ``Instead
of understanding it was just an attempt by the army to incite
trouble, NATO might believe that the government is no longer in
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps uniquely in the Balkans, Montenegro has a tradition of
independent journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure is horrible because we've got that constant
feeling that the army can grab you any time you go out on the
street,'' said Milka Tadic, the managing editor of The Monitor, a
weekly newspaper with a circulation of 10,000. The government has
provided protection for Monitor employees and has pledged to
support their efforts to continue publishing, even though many of
the paper's articles are also critical of the current government.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they have a reason to protect us,'' Ms. Tadic said. ``We
can say much more about what is going on in Serbia than the
state-owned media. We are openly writing about ethnic cleansing in
Kosovo and about the moves by the army of occupation here.''

   Spring is the beginning of the baseball season for 750 major
leaguers, but for the scouts who scour the nation trying to locate
the next generation of players, this is their pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   The Mark McGwires and Ken Griffeys of tomorrow are dotted across
America waiting to be picked in the June 2 amateur draft.
Identifying them is the hard part. Picking future superstars is far
trickier in baseball than in football or basketball because the
players are younger (half of them are 18 and under), and even the
most seasoned collegians must spend several years in the minor
leagues learning the esoteric skills of the professional game.
Prospects turn to suspects with alarming frequency.
</P>
<P>
   Many of today's major league standouts were tabbed for stardom
in high school and college. Others overcame the scouts' doubts.
Following are excerpts from scouting reports filed on players while
they were unknown amateurs.

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Ken Griffey Jr. had been the talk of
Cincinnati's Moeller High School for two years when Roger
Jongewaard, the Seattle Mariners' scouting director, watched him
play in 1987. The Mariners held the No. 1 pick in the draft and
Jongewaard had to persuade his bosses that Griffey, a raw
17-year-old senior, was more attractive than a polished college
pitcher who could help the team more quickly. He did so in part
with this report, which rated Griffey a 72 on baseball's standard
20-to-80 scouting scale:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Trim, well-proportioned, young face and body. . . . Immature at
times. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Rare combination of speed/power/instincts. Smooth, fluid,
natural actions. Makes game look easy. Bat speed with HR power.
Centerfield arm and overall defense. ... Will show lackadaisical
play. Doesn't utilize outstanding natural ability all of the time.
...
</P>
<P>
   Similar style but much better than Barry Bonds at same stage.
Superstar potential.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Greg Maddux, an uninspiring 5 feet 10 and
155 pounds as a senior at Valley High in Las Vegas, had been rated
by many organizations as a fourth- or fifth-round pick for the 1984
draft. One Chicago Cubs scout wrote that he ``lacks overall control
on all pitches,'' which seems unfathomable today considering that
Maddux, now an Atlanta Brave, controls his pitches like a
marionette. Doug Mapson, another Cubs scout, convinced the Cubs to
gamble on Maddux in the second round:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   I really believe that this boy would possibly be the No. 1
player taken in the country if only he looked a bit more physical.
He throws 86-89 [m.p.h.) consistently with very good movement.
</P>
<P>
   His movement isn't a gradual tailing type but a quick explosive
bat-breaking kink. He has a big league curveball right now although
he needs to be a little more consistent with it.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Randy Johnson was an enigma to scouts who
watched the left-hander pitch at Livermore High School in
California in 1982. Already 6-foot-10 but just 185 pounds, the
future fireballer threw 92 mph yet was all arms and legs with
little control of his body, much less his pitches. Joe McIlvaine,
the New York Mets' scouting director, watched Johnson, now with the
Arizona Diamondbacks, and came away intrigued but hardly
raving:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Timid due to awkwardness and plenty of room to fill out. ...
</P>
<P>
   No concept yet, just a thrower. Johnson is like a box of Cracker
Jacks, there's a surprise inside. Our only problem is whether or
not we will like the surprise. He's a boom or bust. Long way to go
yet. Has no pitching mechanics. ...
</P>
<P>
   With his long arms could eventually bury all left-handed
hitters. A real gamble.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)It's hard to find anyone who thought Mark
McGwire was a gamble coming out of the University of Southern
California in 1984. The current St. Louis Cardinals home run king
led major colleges with 32 homers and left scouts drooling. One was
Chuck McMichael of the Kansas City Royals, who after filing this
report watched helplessly while the Oakland A's grabbed McGwire at
No. 10:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Very large frame, very strong. ... Consistent average to
above-average bat speed. Dominant top hand. ...
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally takes some pretty good-looking fastballs; may be
guessing a little much. Long swing, contact ability may drop the
further he goes. Breaking pitch away hurts him. ... Chance to hit
40 HR's + .275 for me.
</P>

17-year-old shortstop from Kalamazoo, Mich., named Derek Jeter:(END

<P>
   Slender, agile body with long arms and legs. Large feet. . . .
Outstanding infield instincts. Soft hands and strong, accurate arm.
Bat has quickness. . . . Makes contact with gap power. Will hit
occasional long ball. Comes to play.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Because the Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa grew up
in the Dominican Republic, he wasn't subject to the draft and could
be signed by any organization when he turned 16 years old. Omar
Minaya, a Texas Rangers scout, signed him in 1985 for just $3,500
and one year later worked with him in the rookie-level Gulf Coast
League. His report foresaw deficiencies Sosa would retain until
last year's 66-home run barrage made him the National League's Most
Valuable Player:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Strong arm, above-average power potential, plays very hard and
aggressively, ball jumps off bat. ... Swings at anything and flies
open, does not have a strike zone. ... Discipline at plate must be
stressed. ...

<P>
   Samuel is a kid that possesses a lot of potential. He is very
aggressive and wishes to play in the major leagues very badly. ...
Most people love his personality and he is a pleasure to watch
playing.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Alex Rodriguez of Miami's Westminster
Christian Academy was so advanced in 1993 that scouts judged his
potential as a celebrity as well as a ballplayer. Jongewaard, who
later drafted Rodriguez as the Mariners' top overall pick just as
he had with Griffey six years before, said he was ``better at 17
now than all the superstars in baseball were when they were seniors
in HS.'' A Braves scout, Scott Littlefield, went further:(END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez-type body w/o as broad of shoulders. ... Can
field, throw, hit, hit for power, and steal an occasional base.
Pluses across the board. Outstanding kid who loves to play and is
handling all of the attention w/ no problem. Outstanding! Dominate
player! ... Should be a franchise player and play in many all-star
games.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Not every future all-star received such
accolades. When McIlvaine saw the future Cy Young Award winner Orel
Hershiser get bombed as a Bowling Green University junior on a cold
and rainy afternoon in 1979, the scout wrote off one of the best
clutch pitchers of this generation:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   No command or control. Fastball lacking velocity for big man.
Doesn't throw curveball properly but has possibilities. Didn't like
arm action as he labors through the throwing zone. ... Delivery
inconsistent, threw several wild pitches. Looks like he rattles
easily. Questionable makeup with physical question marks in a
21-year-old leaves me with an empty feeling about him.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Hershiser's future manager in Los Angeles,
Tommy Lasorda, was scouting for the Dodgers in 1965 when he watched
a 20-year-old right-hander pitch for Southern Cal. Lasorda's report
on Tom Seaver now resides in Cooperstown among those for several
other Hall of Famers:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   This boy showed a real good fast ball with good life, has real
good command of point of release. Boy has slider type of curve but
could improve as he has good arm action and should be able to come
up with good curve. Boy has plenty of desire to pitch and wants to
beat you.

ISRAEL: A LAND OF TRIBES, AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In the nightly avalanche of television ads
punctuating the Israeli election campaign, a commercial by a small
Russian immigrant party stands out.
</P>
<P>
   It is only in Russian. No Hebrew narration, no Hebrew subtitles;
a message solely for the ears of immigrants from the former Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   The unabashedly narrow appeal was a startling example of
divisions that increasingly define Israeli society. Candidates
tailor their messages to specific groups, fighting for the
sympathies of ethnic voting blocs by promising to promote their
particular agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Barak, the Labor Party candidate for prime minister,
features unemployed working-class Sephardic Jews in television ads
that lambaste Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's economic
performance. Netanyahu accuses Labor of elitism, charging that the
party ``doesn't represent the people: not the Sephardic Jews, not
the Russian immigrants, not the ultra-Orthodox, not the Jewish
settlers.''
</P>
<P>
   Such depictions of Israeli society as an aggregation of groups,
not individuals, reflect a hardening of social divisions in recent
years. More than ever, Israelis view each other as members of
ideological, religious or ethnic sub-units, rather than as one
society with shared values.
</P>
<P>
   The vanishing of the notion of an Israeli melting pot, once
expected to forge a new secular Zionist man and woman, has
paralleled the growing ethnic assertiveness of various groups in
the United States, where many now focus on maintaining group
identity rather than on integration into the American mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   The social gaps in Israel have geographical expression. Many
religious Zionists, following the pattern of ultra-Orthodox Jews,
are increasingly living in separate neighborhoods and communities.
Newcomers from Russia settle in what have become immigrant quarters
of some Israeli cities, shopping in their own stores and reading
their own Russian-language press; many Sephardic Jews remain in
depressed ``development towns'' and in low-income housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   The tribal trend is graphically evident among those Jews who are
religious enough to wear a yarmulke (kippah in Hebrew) at all
times. For these men, the size and color of the kippah can be an
indicator of their religious and political bent. A black velvet
kippah is typical of the followers of the ultra-Orthodox Sephardic
party Shas. A knitted kippah often means the wearer is a religious
nationalist, perhaps a Jewish settler. And the larger the kippah,
the more religious or nationalist the wearer is likely to be.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic, religious and political differences increasingly
overlap, reinforcing the divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Most religious Israelis, especially the ultra-Orthodox, have
aligned themselves firmly with the political right in recent years,
putting them at odds with liberal, secular Israelis not only over
questions of religion and state but also over ceding land for peace
with the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, one of the most prominent social and political
splits in Israel has been between Ashkenazic Jews _ those whose
origins are in Central and Eastern Europe _ and Sephardic Jews, who
are of Middle Eastern and North African origin. Now ethnic and
religious tension appears to be building between the new Russian
immigrants and the Sephardim.
</P>
<P>
   Culturally apart, the two groups are also divided along
religious lines, with the Russians avowedly secular and the
Sephardim more traditionally observant.
</P>
<P>
   The fissure has opened wide in the current campaign. Yisrael
B'Aliyah, a party of Russian immigrants headed by Natan Sharansky,
is publicly wrangling with Shas over control of the powerful
Interior Ministry, which has long been a preserve of Shas. The
ministry registers immigrants as Jews and grants them Israeli
citizenship, and it has questioned the Jewish credentials of many
arrivals from the former Soviet Union, blocking their marriage or
burial as Jews, and even deporting some.
</P>
<P>
   With the May 17 elections rapidly approaching, the splintering
of Israeli society has produced a cacophony of campaign messages by
32 different parties competing for seats in the parliament. A
multiplicity of voices is sometimes a sign of a healthy democracy,
but that is not the way the babble is being interpreted here.
Rather, commentators and analysts are struck by the tensions that
they hear expressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only are there many groups, but there are fewer points of
connection between them and there is less of a chance for
dialogue,'' said Dr. Asher Cohen of Bar-Ilan University. ``In past
decades there were areas of agreement that moderated the debate.
Now the divisions overlap.''''
</P>
<P>
   Hannah Kim, a columnist for the newspaper Haaretz, said
recently: ``In recent years we have been straddling the seam
between multi-cultural pluralism and factionalism. Pluralism is
enlightened, positive, democratic. Factionalism means the absence
of a common bond uniting the whole society.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's founders envisioned a state that would unify immigrants
from far-flung Jewish communities in a liberal Western-style
democracy. Instead, the proliferation of entrenched ideological,
ethnic and religious factions seems to be closing many Israelis to
the kind of open discourse in which their groups could integrate,
and this reinforces their sense of isolation.
</P>
<P>
   A stark example is the cocoonlike environment created by Shas,
which is a broad social movement as well as a party, and whose
followers include many traditional working-class Sephardic Jews who
are not Orthodox. Guided by an ideology that scorns Western
culture, the movement has its own newspaper and television
broadcasts, and runs schools and youth programs that teach only
religious subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shas is against broad education and sees it as an enemy, so it
is entrenching the poor in their poverty, not advancing them,''
said Ms. Kim.
</P>
<P>
   Although it seeks to promote the ethnic pride of Jews from the
Middle East and North Africa and has become a powerful political
force, Shas has done little to break barriers to social mobility
that have left many Sephardic Jews living in economically depressed
communities with poor schools. And while Sephardic Israelis have
reached the highest levels of government and the army, they are
still under-represented in universities and the halls of economic
power.
</P>
<P>
   Their resentment, along with the restiveness of the Russian
immigrants, are persistent themes of the Israeli election campaign,
which has at times descended to name-calling and ethnic slurs. When
the dust settles after May 17, Israelis will have to confront the
scars left by the campaign and it will be a challenge to show that
they can still talk to each other.

ISRAEL: A LAND OF TRIBES, AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In the nightly avalanche of television ads
punctuating the Israeli election campaign, a commercial by a small
Russian immigrant party stands out.
</P>
<P>
   It is only in Russian. No Hebrew narration, no Hebrew subtitles;
a message solely for the ears of immigrants from the former Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   The unabashedly narrow appeal was a startling example of
divisions that increasingly define Israeli society. Candidates
tailor their messages to specific groups, fighting for the
sympathies of ethnic voting blocs by promising to promote their
particular agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Barak, the Labor Party candidate for prime minister,
features unemployed working-class Sephardic Jews in television ads
that lambaste Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's economic
performance. Netanyahu accuses Labor of elitism, charging that the
party ``doesn't represent the people: not the Sephardic Jews, not
the Russian immigrants, not the ultra-Orthodox, not the Jewish
settlers.''
</P>
<P>
   Such depictions of Israeli society as an aggregation of groups,
not individuals, reflect a hardening of social divisions in recent
years. More than ever, Israelis view each other as members of
ideological, religious or ethnic sub-units, rather than as one
society with shared values.
</P>
<P>
   The vanishing of the notion of an Israeli melting pot, once
expected to forge a new secular Zionist man and woman, has
paralleled the growing ethnic assertiveness of various groups in
the United States, where many now focus on maintaining group
identity rather than on integration into the American mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   The social gaps in Israel have geographical expression. Many
religious Zionists, following the pattern of ultra-Orthodox Jews,
are increasingly living in separate neighborhoods and communities.
Newcomers from Russia settle in what have become immigrant quarters
of some Israeli cities, shopping in their own stores and reading
their own Russian-language press; many Sephardic Jews remain in
depressed ``development towns'' and in low-income housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   The tribal trend is graphically evident among those Jews who are
religious enough to wear a yarmulke (kippah in Hebrew) at all
times. For these men, the size and color of the kippah can be an
indicator of their religious and political bent. A black velvet
kippah is typical of the followers of the ultra-Orthodox Sephardic
party Shas. A knitted kippah often means the wearer is a religious
nationalist, perhaps a Jewish settler. And the larger the kippah,
the more religious or nationalist the wearer is likely to be.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic, religious and political differences increasingly
overlap, reinforcing the divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Most religious Israelis, especially the ultra-Orthodox, have
aligned themselves firmly with the political right in recent years,
putting them at odds with liberal, secular Israelis not only over
questions of religion and state but also over ceding land for peace
with the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, one of the most prominent social and political
splits in Israel has been between Ashkenazic Jews _ those whose
origins are in Central and Eastern Europe _ and Sephardic Jews, who
are of Middle Eastern and North African origin. Now ethnic and
religious tension appears to be building between the new Russian
immigrants and the Sephardim.
</P>
<P>
   Culturally apart, the two groups are also divided along
religious lines, with the Russians avowedly secular and the
Sephardim more traditionally observant.
</P>
<P>
   The fissure has opened wide in the current campaign. Yisrael
B'Aliyah, a party of Russian immigrants headed by Natan Sharansky,
is publicly wrangling with Shas over control of the powerful
Interior Ministry, which has long been a preserve of Shas. The
ministry registers immigrants as Jews and grants them Israeli
citizenship, and it has questioned the Jewish credentials of many
arrivals from the former Soviet Union, blocking their marriage or
burial as Jews, and even deporting some.
</P>
<P>
   With the May 17 elections rapidly approaching, the splintering
of Israeli society has produced a cacophony of campaign messages by
32 different parties competing for seats in the parliament. A
multiplicity of voices is sometimes a sign of a healthy democracy,
but that is not the way the babble is being interpreted here.
Rather, commentators and analysts are struck by the tensions that
they hear expressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only are there many groups, but there are fewer points of
connection between them and there is less of a chance for
dialogue,'' said Dr. Asher Cohen of Bar-Ilan University. ``In past
decades there were areas of agreement that moderated the debate.
Now the divisions overlap.''''
</P>
<P>
   Hannah Kim, a columnist for the newspaper Haaretz, said
recently: ``In recent years we have been straddling the seam
between multi-cultural pluralism and factionalism. Pluralism is
enlightened, positive, democratic. Factionalism means the absence
of a common bond uniting the whole society.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's founders envisioned a state that would unify immigrants
from far-flung Jewish communities in a liberal Western-style
democracy. Instead, the proliferation of entrenched ideological,
ethnic and religious factions seems to be closing many Israelis to
the kind of open discourse in which their groups could integrate,
and this reinforces their sense of isolation.
</P>
<P>
   A stark example is the cocoonlike environment created by Shas,
which is a broad social movement as well as a party, and whose
followers include many traditional working-class Sephardic Jews who
are not Orthodox. Guided by an ideology that scorns Western
culture, the movement has its own newspaper and television
broadcasts, and runs schools and youth programs that teach only
religious subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shas is against broad education and sees it as an enemy, so it
is entrenching the poor in their poverty, not advancing them,''
said Ms. Kim.
</P>
<P>
   Although it seeks to promote the ethnic pride of Jews from the
Middle East and North Africa and has become a powerful political
force, Shas has done little to break barriers to social mobility
that have left many Sephardic Jews living in economically depressed
communities with poor schools. And while Sephardic Israelis have
reached the highest levels of government and the army, they are
still under-represented in universities and the halls of economic
power.
</P>
<P>
   Their resentment, along with the restiveness of the Russian
immigrants, are persistent themes of the Israeli election campaign,
which has at times descended to name-calling and ethnic slurs. When
the dust settles after May 17, Israelis will have to confront the
scars left by the campaign and it will be a challenge to show that
they can still talk to each other.

   Mount Everest, a brutal tower of subzero temperatures, sudden
blizzards and the thinnest air, gives up its dead grudgingly. On
May 1, the remains of the legendary George Leigh Mallory were
identified by an American expedition retracing his route 75 years
later.
</P>
<P>
   It had been Mallory who answered the question, ``Why climb
Everest?'' with the deathless, ``Because it is there.'' Mallory, a
38-year-old British schoolteacher, and Andrew Irvine, a 28-year-old
Cambridge student, disappeared on the northern slope in 1924,
leaving behind a mystery that endures to this day. Did they reach
the summit?
</P>
<P>
   A pair of snow goggles, a hob-nail boot and a length of climbing
rope were found with Mallory. And though the mountaineers of the
1920s also struggled with supplies and oxygen tanks, which were
thought to be unsporting, the content of their load differed from
that of the first successful 1953 ascent by Sir Edmund Hillary and
Tenzing Norgay. The equipment for the 1999 Mallory and Irvine
Research expedition weighed 3.5 tons, excluding more than 1,500
pounds of oxygen, according to Erin Copland of International
Mountain Guides.
</P>
<P>
   Today the assault on the world's highest peak is no longer the
lofty realm of explorers but a highly commercialized enterprise
managed by professional guides, including generations of Sherpas.
For $65,000 and more, relatively inexperienced mountain climbers
can join expeditions that take with them satellite tracking
systems, computers, cellular phones, Krazy glue, espresso machines,
M&AMP;Ms and Pop Tarts, and they leave behind so much detritus that
Nepal and China charge them princely sums for what may seem to be a
license to litter. So far some 600 people have reached the summit;
more than 150 have perished in the attempt.
</P>
<P>
   For those who just want an experience that does not put them in
mortal peril, MountainZone.com, an Internet sporting retailer,
maintains a Web site (www.everest.mountainzone.com) that provides
updated dispatches from the members of the current Everest
expedition while displaying souvenir merchandise like fleece vests
and prayer flags.
</P>
<P>
   Although advancements in mountain-climbing gear have made the
trip lighter over the century, teams now carry more and store their
supplies in camps strung out along the route to the
29,028-foot-high summit.
</P>
<P>
   For those still wistfully upwardly mobile, a sobering breakdown
follows of the equipment that separates the real (overwhelmingly
male) explorers of yesteryear from the antacid-eating, CD-playing
expeditioners of today.

FIGHTING WORDS BECOME BEST-SELLERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. military-literary-industrial complex is gathering might
with the surprising success of new books that portray modern
warriors as complicated heroes who confront enemies and their own
mistakes with a mixture of courage and fear.
</P>
<P>
   Two nonfiction titles with these themes have climbed onto The
New York Times best-seller list recently despite having been
rejected by top publishers because of doubts about sales prospects
and potential readership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blind Man's Bluff,'' which recounts the exploits of Navy
submariners who spied on the Soviet Union's harbors, was canceled
by its original publisher, Simon &AMP; Schuster, which had misgivings
about the potential for a book with a Cold War theme. ``Black Hawk
Down,'' a gritty account of the 1993 battle in Mogadishu, Somalia,
that left 18 U.S. soldiers and more than 500 Somalis dead, was also
rejected by large publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these unlikely best-sellers were written by authors with
no military background who offered a sympathetic view of the
20th-century warrior and had a knack for tapping them as readers.
``Blind Man's Bluff,'' by Sherry Sontag and Christopher Drew, a
reporter for The New York Times, was eventually sold to a small
publisher, Public Affairs, while ``Black Hawk Down,'' by Mark
Bowden, landed with Grove/Atlantic, an independent publisher that
paid an advance of only $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   Other current nonfiction titles with military themes include
``Immaculate Invasion'' (Viking), by the novelist Bob Shacochis,
who spent 18 months with a team of Special Forces commandos during
the 1994 U.S. intervention in Haiti, and ``Rogue Warrior: The Real
Team'' (Pocket), an account of Navy Seal missions written by
Richard Marcinko, a retired Navy commander.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the ground for this wave of true-life military tales was
already claimed by best-selling authors like Stephen E. Ambrose,
with his histories of World War II, and Tom Clancy, the
techno-thriller pioneer. But there appear to be several forces
propelling the latest surge in military titles. For one thing,
authors are racing to record the stories of aging World War II
veterans. Elizabeth M. Norman, author of ``We Band of Angels''
(Random House), scrambled to track down elderly women to interview
for her account of American nurses imprisoned by the Japanese in
the Philippines after the attack on Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew little about our parents' war,'' Ms. Norman said. ``In
middle age, we looked at the current state of our culture and began
to appreciate the enormous obstacles and challenges our parents had
to overcome to wage and win a world war. We also faced the reality
that our parents are old and dying and if we are to extract any
lessons, any details of their experience, we have to do it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Writers are also finding inspiration in the military's
contemporary internal debate about the role of the modern soldier
in regional conflicts _ warrior, humanitarian or a mixture of both?
Unlike much of the literature that emerged after the Vietnam War,
the current books seem to portray soldiers as thoughtful and
conflicted professionals carrying out shifting U.S. policy goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the post-Cold War environment, the military is a bit
confused and doesn't know who it is and is aggressively sorting
that out,'' said Shacochis, whose book explores the ambiguous role
played by U.S. troops in restoring Haiti's first democratically
elected leader to power after he was ousted in a coup.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the Special Forces don't want to do humanitarian
stuff because they signed up for the adventure,'' Shacochis said.
``The idea of baby-sitting Kosovars or Kurds is rather diminishing
to their self-image. So the military is wrangling with this in a
rather fascinating way and they are reinventing themselves. They
understand that the wars of the future are now in places like
Somalia, Iraq, Haiti and Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The military, in turn, seems fascinated by books that interpret
its role and legacy. As a result, writers who have never worn a
uniform are being feted by Navy submariners, invited to sign
autographs at the PX or asked to lecture to the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   After the release of ``Blind Man's Bluff,'' Ms. Sontag and Drew
embarked on an unorthodox stealth book tour to reach the wide
network of military veterans and retirees who might be potential
readers. Ms. Sontag said she collected about 5,000 e-mail addresses
from Web sites devoted to military groups. She then sent letters
announcing the book's publication and asked the recipients to send
the notes to others.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy helped lift ``Blind Man's Bluff'' onto the Times'
best-seller list for 21 weeks, capturing the attention of readers
like George Knudtzon, a retired submarine veteran. When Knudtzon
was told by his Barnes &AMP; Noble in Silverdale, Md., that there
wasn't enough interest in a book like ``Blind Man's Bluff'' to
schedule an author lecture, he rented the local community center,
enlisted his wife and daughter to bake cookies and held an event
featuring Ms. Sontag that he said drew almost 200 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave copies to all four of my kids and to other folks that
I've known throughout my life,'' said Knudtzon, 62. ``And I
included a note saying that this is something I was involved with
that I couldn't talk about. This is why I wasn't home most of the
time when you were growing up.''

FIGHTING WORDS BECOME BEST-SELLERS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The U.S. military-literary-industrial complex is gathering might
with the surprising success of new books that portray modern
warriors as complicated heroes who confront enemies and their own
mistakes with a mixture of courage and fear.
</P>
<P>
   Two nonfiction titles with these themes have climbed onto The
New York Times best-seller list recently despite having been
rejected by top publishers because of doubts about sales prospects
and potential readership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blind Man's Bluff,'' which recounts the exploits of Navy
submariners who spied on the Soviet Union's harbors, was canceled
by its original publisher, Simon &AMP; Schuster, which had misgivings
about the potential for a book with a Cold War theme. ``Black Hawk
Down,'' a gritty account of the 1993 battle in Mogadishu, Somalia,
that left 18 U.S. soldiers and more than 500 Somalis dead, was also
rejected by large publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these unlikely best-sellers were written by authors with
no military background who offered a sympathetic view of the
20th-century warrior and had a knack for tapping them as readers.
``Blind Man's Bluff,'' by Sherry Sontag and Christopher Drew, a
reporter for The New York Times, was eventually sold to a small
publisher, Public Affairs, while ``Black Hawk Down,'' by Mark
Bowden, landed with Grove/Atlantic, an independent publisher that
paid an advance of only $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   Other current nonfiction titles with military themes include
``Immaculate Invasion'' (Viking), by the novelist Bob Shacochis,
who spent 18 months with a team of Special Forces commandos during
the 1994 U.S. intervention in Haiti, and ``Rogue Warrior: The Real
Team'' (Pocket), an account of Navy Seal missions written by
Richard Marcinko, a retired Navy commander.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the ground for this wave of true-life military tales was
already claimed by best-selling authors like Stephen E. Ambrose,
with his histories of World War II, and Tom Clancy, the
techno-thriller pioneer. But there appear to be several forces
propelling the latest surge in military titles. For one thing,
authors are racing to record the stories of aging World War II
veterans. Elizabeth M. Norman, author of ``We Band of Angels''
(Random House), scrambled to track down elderly women to interview
for her account of American nurses imprisoned by the Japanese in
the Philippines after the attack on Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew little about our parents' war,'' Ms. Norman said. ``In
middle age, we looked at the current state of our culture and began
to appreciate the enormous obstacles and challenges our parents had
to overcome to wage and win a world war. We also faced the reality
that our parents are old and dying and if we are to extract any
lessons, any details of their experience, we have to do it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Writers are also finding inspiration in the military's
contemporary internal debate about the role of the modern soldier
in regional conflicts _ warrior, humanitarian or a mixture of both?
Unlike much of the literature that emerged after the Vietnam War,
the current books seem to portray soldiers as thoughtful and
conflicted professionals carrying out shifting U.S. policy goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the post-Cold War environment, the military is a bit
confused and doesn't know who it is and is aggressively sorting
that out,'' said Shacochis, whose book explores the ambiguous role
played by U.S. troops in restoring Haiti's first democratically
elected leader to power after he was ousted in a coup.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the Special Forces don't want to do humanitarian
stuff because they signed up for the adventure,'' Shacochis said.
``The idea of baby-sitting Kosovars or Kurds is rather diminishing
to their self-image. So the military is wrangling with this in a
rather fascinating way and they are reinventing themselves. They
understand that the wars of the future are now in places like
Somalia, Iraq, Haiti and Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The military, in turn, seems fascinated by books that interpret
its role and legacy. As a result, writers who have never worn a
uniform are being feted by Navy submariners, invited to sign
autographs at the PX or asked to lecture to the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   After the release of ``Blind Man's Bluff,'' Ms. Sontag and Drew
embarked on an unorthodox stealth book tour to reach the wide
network of military veterans and retirees who might be potential
readers. Ms. Sontag said she collected about 5,000 e-mail addresses
from Web sites devoted to military groups. She then sent letters
announcing the book's publication and asked the recipients to send
the notes to others.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy helped lift ``Blind Man's Bluff'' onto the Times'
best-seller list for 21 weeks, capturing the attention of readers
like George Knudtzon, a retired submarine veteran. When Knudtzon
was told by his Barnes &AMP; Noble in Silverdale, Md., that there
wasn't enough interest in a book like ``Blind Man's Bluff'' to
schedule an author lecture, he rented the local community center,
enlisted his wife and daughter to bake cookies and held an event
featuring Ms. Sontag that he said drew almost 200 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave copies to all four of my kids and to other folks that
I've known throughout my life,'' said Knudtzon, 62. ``And I
included a note saying that this is something I was involved with
that I couldn't talk about. This is why I wasn't home most of the
time when you were growing up.''

WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO CLEANSE SERBIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

<P>
   Along the blood-spattered timeline of Slobodan Milosevic's
Yugoslavia, Kosovo is merely the hideous Now. There was a Before _
in Croatia and Bosnia. Assuming that Milosevic retreats from Kosovo
with his dictatorship intact, as now seems likely, Balkans experts
foresee an unspeakable After.
</P>
<P>
   It may feature: Fratricidal civil war in Montenegro. Ethnic
cleansing of Hungarians in the Serbian province of Vojvodina. Mass
murder of Muslims in the Sandzak region of Serbia. No need, for the
moment, to bother about the location or correct pronunciation of
these obscure places. The world will likely learn. Just as it
learned where Kosovo is _ or was _ before more than 700,000 human
beings were chased from their homes in a systematic military
campaign of burning and intimidation, theft and murder.
</P>
<P>
   If the pattern holds, Milosevic will soldier on, using Big Lie
manipulation of television to tap into a collective soft spot in
the Serbian psyche. Even as legions of non-Serbs are dispossessed
or killed, he will continue to inflame the Serbs and preserve his
power by reassuring them that, yes,  &UR; they &LR;  are the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Given the character of Milosevic's regime and knowing that there
is almost certainly more horror to come, a bold, if impractical,
question is just now beginning to be formulated. Is it finally time
for outside powers to make the effort necessary to cure a national
psychosis inside Serbia that has been destabilizing a corner of
Europe for a decade?
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, has the time come for NATO to do in Serbia what
the Allies did in Germany and Japan after World II?
</P>
<P>
   To follow that model, Serbia's military would have to be
destroyed, and Milosevic crushed, by an invasion that almost
certainly would cost the lives of hundreds of U.S. soldiers. After
unconditional surrender, the political, social and economic fabric
of Serbia would be remade under outside supervision so that the
Serbs could take their place in a prosperous and democratic world.
</P>
<P>
   The question cuts three ways. Will it happen? Should it happen?
Could it possibly work?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the first part of this question, at least for the
foreseeable future, is a resounding No Way. The other answers,
however, are provocative enough to make it worthwhile to suspend
disbelief and indulge the fantasy of a post-Milosevic Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start, though, with the real world. Policy-makers and
long-time students of the West's slow-motion intervention in
Yugoslavia during the 1990's see no possibility of Milosevic's
military defeat or of Serbia's occupation.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement last week between the West and Russia outlined the
kind of solution the outside powers would seek instead _ a
withdrawal from Kosovo of the Yugoslav army, police and
paramilitary fighters, with an international security force to
replace them. Details of the deal are still being argued over, but
one thing was clear: If the outside powers can get him to sign on,
Milosevic would remain in power in his shrinking Yugoslavia. Thus,
he would have the opportunity to ``cleanse'' another day. The
West's calculation seems to be that avoiding a land war, keeping
NATO together and cementing relations with Russia outweigh the
long-term costs of letting Milosevic off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   That, then, is the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Such a course does nothing, of course, to eradicate extreme Serb
nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to stamp out the disease, protect Serbia's
minorities and bring lasting peace to the Balkans is a Japan- or
Germany-style occupation of Serbia, according to Daniel Serwer, who
until two years ago was the director of European intelligence and
research for the State Department. Serwer concedes that occupation
has never been on the West's list of serious options, but he echoes
many experts on the Balkans when he argues that it should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very hard to see how Serbia undergoes this process all
on its own,'' said Serwer, now a fellow at the U.S. Institute of
Peace, a research group in Washington. ``This regime is deeply
rooted. It is not like some dictatorship that you take off its head
and it will die. It is so corrupt and the corruption is not
superficial.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Jonah Goldhagen, a Harvard historian who wrote ``Hitler's
Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust,''
published a kind of manifesto last week that demands Serbia ``be
placed in receivership.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Serbia's deeds are, in their essence, different from those of
Nazi Germany only in scale,'' Goldhagen wrote in The New Republic.
``Milosevic is not Hitler, but he is a genocidal killer who has
caused the murders of many tens of thousands of people.''
</P>
<P>
   It is worth remembering, though, that Milosevic is an elected
leader, having won three elections that were more or less fair.
That, along with the Serb leader's soaring popularity in the wake
of NATO bombing, support an argument that what ails Serbia goes far
deeper than one man.
</P>
<P>
   No one makes this argument more powerfully than Sonja Biserko,
director of the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia and a
former senior advisor in the European department of the Yugoslav
Foreign Ministry. Ms. Biserko, who fled Belgrade a week after the
NATO bombings began, said in New York last week that Serbia's
fundamental problem is not Milosevic, but a ``moral devastation''
that has infected her nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Serbia are undergoing a mass denial of the barbarity
of the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo,'' Ms. Biserko said. ``This
denial is itself commensurate to the crime taking place before the
eyes of the world.''

</P>
<P>
   Ms. Biserko, who met 10 days ago with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and urged her to consider occupation, believes
that Serbia's opposition politicians are incapable now of coming to
grips with a culture of victimhood. ``Serbs have managed now with
the NATO bombing to convince themselves they are victims and as
victims they cannot be responsible for what happened in Kosovo,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   A surreal sense of victimhood in Serbia is nothing new. During
the siege of Sarajevo, when Serb forces ringed that city with
artillery and routinely killed its civilians, Belgrade television
reported that Bosnian Muslims were laying siege to themselves.
``The Serbs continue to defend their centuries-old hills around
Sarajevo,'' said Radio-Television Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   To shatter this Looking Glass victimhood, Ms. Biserko offers a
prescription: Indictment of Milosevic by the War Crimes Tribunal. A
military defeat of Serbia and demilitarization of the country.
Highly publicized trials that will force Serbs to confront the
savagery committed in their name. A Western takeover of the mass
media, with strict prohibitions against the dissemination of
extreme Serb nationalism. A Marshall Plan for the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the West should be willing to undertake an occupation
that would risk many lives, cost billions and take years, Ms.
Biserko shrugged: ``What other choice is there?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Western world has lost its political instinct,'' she said.
``To bring substance to the ideals of human rights, at some point
you must be willing to commit troops.''
</P>
<P>
   But could the occupation of Serbia work? Could it break the
cycle of violence? Two prominent historians believe it could, if
done properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key in Japan was unconditional surrender,'' said John W.
Dower, a professor of history at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and author of ``Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of
World War II.'' ``The Americans went in and they did everything.
They had a major land reform. They abolished the military, simply
got rid of it. They drafted a new constitution. This is what you
can do when you have unconditional surrender.''
</P>
<P>
   Dower was struck by the eagerness with which a defeated people
welcomed reform. ``In Japan, the average person was really sick of
war, and I think that would be the case in Yugoslavia,'' he said.
``The Americans cracked open a repressive military system and the
people filled the space.''
</P>
<P>
   The occupation of Germany also suggests ways of dealing with
Yugoslavia, according to Thomas Alan Schwartz, a historian at
Vanderbilt and author of ``America's Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When Germany was totally defeated, it provided opportunity,''
he said. ``You could be physically there, controlling the flow of
information and using war-crime trials to show the Germans that
atrocities were done in their name.''
</P>
<P>
   Without something similar in Serbia, Schwartz said, ``We can
look forward to more trouble in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``What reminds me of Germany is the comparison to the end of
World War I,'' he added. ``Then, the Germans had this powerful
sense of being victims. There was a deep resentment that Hitler was
able to exploit. It will be the same in Serbia when NATO bombing
stops.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japan and Germany analogies, of course, are flawed. Those
major-league powers ravaged parts of the world that America cared
about. Occupation was nothing less than emergency triage for the
worst violence in history.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, by comparison, is small potatoes. He leads a
minor-league country that periodically lays waste to poor,
unpronounceable, strategically irrelevant places. Pristina is not
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   There is, though, an inkling that the West has begun to try for
a solution. In Bosnia, 32,000 NATO-led troops and High Commissioner
Carlos Westendorp are even now doing the hard, slow, complex work
of healing that country.
</P>
<P>
   Westendorp has not attempted a Japan-style remake of the
Serb-populated half of Bosnia (just as nobody has tried to do that
in neighboring Croatia, with its own accomplishments in ethnic
cleansing). The indicted war criminals Radovan Karadzic and Ratko
Mladic have not been hunted down. Radical Serb parties have not
been banned. But tough action is being taken. Westendorp ordered
radical Serb nationalists out of state television. He has fired the
nationalist zealot who was elected the Bosnian Serbs' president. If
Serbs violently object to what the peacekeepers do, NATO-led forces
shoot to kill.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview in Sarajevo, Westendorp said most Bosnian
Serbs are cooperating because they are sick of war. It will take
time, he said, but the West has enough money and muscle in Bosnia
to extinguish the will to war. The one insoluble problem, he said,
was the leader in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``If getting rid of Milosevic fails,'' he said, ``then
everything fails.''

   Westendorp has not attempted a Japan-style remake of the
Serb-populated half of Bosnia (just as nobody has tried to do that
in neighboring Croatia, with its own accomplishments in ethnic
cleansing). The indicted war criminals Radovan Karadzic and Ratko
Mladic have not been hunted down. Radical Serb parties have not
been banned. But tough action is being taken. Westendorp ordered
radical Serb nationalists out of state television. He has fired the
nationalist zealot who was elected the Bosnian Serbs' president. If
Serbs violently object to what the peacekeepers do, NATO-led forces
shoot to kill.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview in Sarajevo, Westendorp said most Bosnian
Serbs are cooperating because they are sick of war. It will take
time, he said, but the West has enough money and muscle in Bosnia
to extinguish the will to war. The one insoluble problem, he said,
was the leader in Belgrade.

   No Joy in Baltimore &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If there is any stage on which Fidel Castro has always delighted
in mixing competition with politics, it is sports. And if there is
any sport that Cubans, including Castro, love, it is baseball.
</P>
<P>
   So Cuba's humiliation of a U.S. major league team last week _ a
12-6 romp over the Baltimore Orioles in a rain-swept Camden Yards _
felt doubly sweet for the visiting Cubans. On March 28, in Havana,
the Orioles had barely eked out a victory over the Cuban national
team in 11 innings, and this time they appeared to be no
competition at all for the Cubans. The Orioles pitched poorly,
fielded sloppily and hit badly, getting 6 hits to the Cubans' 18.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, according to third baseman Omar Linares, the victory
was occasion for ``a national party.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercifully for the Orioles, no third game was planned. &QL;

   Here are a few of the things the mirror of television has shown
Americans about the American family: Dad is the master and always
wears a comforting cardigan (``Father Knows Best''); Dad is full of
right-wing bluster and hates his son-in-law (``All in the
Family''); Dad is a clueless shoe salesman with an oversexed wife
and daughter and he bickers constantly (``Married . . . With
Children'').
</P>
<P>
   The most enduring situation around which television comedies
have been built is the family unit, in one form or another. That's
what the families sitting in front of their tubes identified with
for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, it seems. With the demise of the long-running ABC
series, ``Home Improvement,'' America is all but losing its last
network sitcom built around a thriving family unit. Shows now
either take place in the workplace or focus on the self-absorbed
lives of singles _ searching, it often happens, for the family life
they grew up watching on television, but find out of reach.

   A Deadline Passes With No Palestinian State
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank and Gaza, May 4, which was to have been a
triumphal date, came and went without a declaration of Palestinian
statehood. It also came and went without much notice, aside from a
handful of small protests.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, however, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is
running behind in the polls as the May 17 elections approach, tried
to turn the day into a moment: his moment.
</P>
<P>
   He proclaimed a victory for standing so tough that Yasser
Arafat, the Palestinian leader, had been forced to defer a
statehood declaration for fear of Israel's retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, however, faced nearly universal pressure, including from
Arab states, to recommit himself to the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   While May 4 was the day the interim period set up by the Oslo
peace accord expired, both Israel and the Palestinians have agreed
to extend the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Arafat awaits the outcome of the Israeli elections to see
who will be his new partner _ or adversary _ at the negotiating
table.

   At its first meeting, Turkey's newly elected Parliament turned
not to pressing problems like inflation, human rights or

American-educated deputy from Istanbul, sought unsuccessfully to
take her oath of office while wearing a scarf.

   She was harshly denounced by the president, the prime minister

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Olivier Blanchard, a liberal economist at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, is asked why unemployment rates are higher
in Europe than in the United States, he likes to tell audiences
about a pamphlet he saw in a British library: ``Leaving School:
What You Need to Know About Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   His point: Europe's cradle-to-grave safety net means not only
that being out of work has become a viable way of making a living,
but that there is no longer much stigma attached to joblessness.
That goes a long way in explaining the contrast between America's
current jobs boom and the contrasting jobs bust in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Not that long ago, the best and brightest young American
economists were churning out papers with titles like, ``Why Is U.S.
Unemployment So High at Full Employment?'' As recently as five
years ago, slow job growth, downsizing and shrinking paychecks
loomed large in America's psyche, and in 1992 Lester C. Thurow's
book ``Head to Head: The Coming Economic Battle Among Japan,
America and Europe,'' hailing the superiority of the European and
Japanese economic models, was atop the best-seller lists.
</P>
<P>
   Not any more. Today, American blacks, long afflicted by
double-digit unemployment rates, are less likely to be out of work
than Europeans. For the first time in memory, the U.S. jobless rate
has dipped below that of Japan, where until recently lifetime
employment was taken for granted. What's more, U.S. pay and
productivity are rising handily.
</P>
<P>
   What's behind America's jobs miracle? And why have long-time
world beaters suddenly turned into apparent deadbeats?
</P>
<P>
   Part of the answer is that America's economy is booming. A
surprisingly tame inflation rate has allowed the Federal Reserve,
which controls the amount of money in circulation and thus the
spending power of companies that create jobs, to avoid raising
interest rates _ even as joblessness has dropped to the lowest
level in 30 years. The rate for April, released last week, barely
inched up, from 4.2 percent to 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the economies of Japan and Europe are stagnating.
Japan has been mired in a recession that's lasted about as long as
America's eight-year expansion. While the stagnation was initially
caused by a financial meltdown, says the economist Paul Krugman in
his new book, ``The Return of Depression Economics,'' the main
problem now is that Japan's central bank, fearing inflation, is
unwilling to pump enough money into the economy to lift spending _
and create jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Tight monetary policy is also holding back job growth in Europe.
``Alan Greenspan is willing to push the economy along until he sees
inflation actually picking up,'' says Krugman, referring to the
Federal Reserve chairman, ``but the European Central Bank isn't
giving unemployment a chance to get down.''
</P>
<P>
   But tight monetary policy isn't the main culprit in Europe.
Rather, it's that various safety-net programs over the years have
made not working a viable way of life, especially for young workers
and those who are approaching retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Blanchard and Justin Wolfers of Harvard University, co-authors
of several studies of European labor markets, point to two
especially pernicious institutions. One is the web of restrictions
on layoffs. Even though these rules and regulations are no longer
as numerous or effective as they were a decade ago _ Europe, like
America, has discovered temps _ they are still powerful enough to
have a chilling effect on companies' willingness to hire. As a
result, workers who lose jobs find it very difficult to get new
ones, and rising unemployment doesn't have the normal, healthy
effect of reining in labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger problem is the nature of unemployment benefits. Partly,
it's their generosity. In Sweden, where the unemployment rate has
jumped from a minuscule 1.4 percent to 5.6 percent in the last
decade, unemployed workers can collect nearly 80 percent as much as
if they were working, compared with about 50 percent in the United
States and Japan. In Spain, it's 70 percent (until recently it was
90 percent) and in France it's nearly 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The extent to which generous unemployment benefits inhibit job
growth depends partly on the proportion of workers who are
eligible: Only about one-third of workers who are out of work
qualify for benefits in the United States and Japan, where newer
members of the labor force and temporary workers are ineligible.
Compare that with 89 percent of unemployed workers in Germany and
98 percent in France.
</P>
<P>
   What matters even more is how long benefits can be collected.
Unemployment benefits in Germany are equal to only 36 percent of a
prior paycheck but an ex-worker can collect for at least five
years. In Britain, unemployed people can collect practically
forever. In the United States and Japan, by contrast, the limit is
26 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But if Europe's generous safety net is the key problem, how come
it has taken so long for the chickens to come home to roost? After
all, the welfare state has been in place since the 1950s and '60s,
when full employment was the norm. One explanation, say Blanchard
and Wolfers, is that until the '70s there were few economic jolts
like oil shocks that buffeted rich countries in 1973, 1979 and
1990. ``Shocks displace people, but institutions like
unemployment-benefit programs determine how many people get
displaced and for how long,'' Wolfers said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, many displaced workers stay out of work longer, and
bad things happen when a large group of people stay out of the work
force for a long time. Lawrence Katz, a labor economist at Harvard,
says that reducing the stigma attached to joblessness has profound
effects on the labor market. In Sweden, which combined extremely
low joblessness with extremely generous welfare programs, someone
who got laid off used to be ashamed to admit it to his or her
neighbors. Now, with a new generation of workers less imbued with
that work ethic, much of that shame has evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   There are other negative effects as well. Workers who don't get
rehired fast also lose skills and, more importantly, connections.
Since most hiring is by word of mouth, people who don't know others
with jobs find it hard to get one themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The flaws of the welfare state are compounded by other forms of
government intervention, says Alan B. Krueger, an economist at
Princeton University. One important reason American workers get
hired at such surprising rates is that it's much easier to start
new businesses in the United States. In Austria, Krueger says,
someone who wants to open a pharmacy must get permission from the
other drugstores in town.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, it boils down to social choices. ``One
can say the Europeans have made a political decision that they are
unwilling to tolerate as much income inequality as in the United
States,'' Katz said. ``But equity comes at the cost of job
creation.''
</P>
<P>
   Even today, men in their prime working years are not faring much
worse in Europe or Japan than in the United States. But in America,
which excels at absorbing new workers, other groups like the young,
immigrants and women are faring much better. Now the U.S. economy
is absorbing workers with the least education and the fewest
skills, including ones who have been out of the work force for
years and written off as lost causes.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, choices made decades ago are preventing a similar
expansion in the work force. &QL;

 Includes a color slide of Ian McDiarmid in a scene from ``Star
Wars: The Phantom Menace.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Pop quiz: Who are the three actors who play the same characters
in ``Star Wars: The Phantom Menace'' that they did in the original
``Star Wars'' trilogy?
 &HT;    Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, of course. And Kenny Baker as R2D2,
that makes two. And then there's ... well, there's ... hmmm.
 &HT;    Time's up _ the third would be Ian McDiarmid, the veteran
Scottish actor and staple of the London stage who portrayed the
ghostly, enigmatic and aged Emperor Palpatine in ``Return of the
Jedi'' (1983). He'll reprise the role in George Lucas' ``Phantom
Menace'' when the film opens nationwide on May 19.
 &HT;    Though a repentant Darth Vader heaved the Emperor into the
cosmic void in ``Jedi,'' ``The Phantom Menace'' unfolds nearly 40
years before that event, setting the stage for the 50-something
McDiarmid's return engagement.
 &HT;    The actor had heard via the ``Star Wars'' grapevine that
Palpatine might be involved in the prequel, but only after months
of rumors were those reports confirmed.
 &HT;    ``George Lucas called,'' McDiarmid says, chatting over a bottle
of sparkling water at the bar of the Almeida Theatre, the
prestigious London theater for which he serves as co-artistic
director. ``I hadn't seen George in 15 years, but he asked me to
meet him at a hotel.
 &HT;    ``We got together,'' he continues, ``and I recall that he said,
`Would you like a drink?' I ordered a water, and then he said, `Do
you know anybody who might want to play the Emperor?' And I said,
`Funny you should ask.'
 &HT;    ``He said, `Well, great. Welcome back, if that's what you'd like
to do.'
 &HT;    ``That's how George is,'' McDiarmid says with a chuckle. ``He
gets an idea about something or somebody and follows it through.''
 &HT;    In the $115 million epic, McDiarmid plays the pivotal role of
Senator Palpatine, the principal representative of Queen Amidala
(Natalie Portman), the teen-age ruler of the beleaguered planet
Naboo.
 &HT;    Anyone who remembers Palpatine from ``Return of the Jedi'' won't
have much trouble figuring out that he's up to no good.
 &HT;    ``Palpatine is a politician, and that alone should tell you
volumes about him,'' McDiarmid says with a laugh, stroking his
salt-and-pepper goatee and looking less than evil in jeans and a
black-and-green plaid shirt.
 &HT;    ``I could stop right there, but will say that he's doing the
best he can for his queen and his planet,'' he adds. ``Like all
politicians, however, he is not entirely unaffected by matters of
self-interest.
 &HT;    ``Now, there I shall stop.''
 &HT;    McDiarmid, who is single and lives in the Notting Hill section
of London, knew many of his fellow actors prior to filming. Liam
Neeson (Qui-Gon Jinn) had starred as Oscar Wilde in the Almeida
production of ``The Judas Kiss,'' while Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan
Kenobi) is the nephew of McDiarmid's old friend Denis Lawson, who
played the small role of pilot Wedge Antilles in the first three
``Star Wars'' adventures. Frank Oz (Yoda) directed McDiarmid in the
comedy ``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels'' (1988).
 &HT;    He hadn't previously known Portman, with whom he shares most of
his scenes.
 &HT;    ``Poor Natalie had to deal with a lot,'' he says
sympathetically. ``She's got wonderful makeup and wonderful
costumes, many of them, but some of the costumes were very heavy.
And the headdresses were extremely heavy.
 &HT;    ``The headdresses were often very high up and revolved
backward,'' he says, ``but Natalie came through it wonderfully
well. She's a real professional, and at such a young age.''
 &HT;    ``Phantom Menace'' was an incredibly elaborate film to make,
with lavish sets, intricate costumes and literally thousands of
special effects that would be added digitally after the actors'
work was done.
 &HT;    Even after the shoot, McDiarmid wasn't done. For more than a
year afterward _ and as little as two months before the film's
release _ McDiarmid was still re-recording dialogue and even
shooting new scenes.
 &HT;    But McDiarmid says that Lucas kept everything on an even keel.
 &HT;    ``He's pretty much the same on the set as he is off it,'' the
actor says. ``He's relaxed, friendly and a bit shy. I liked that. I
like George.
 &HT;    ``He made it seem, despite the enormous size of the whole thing,
that we were a small group doing a movie,'' McDiarmid adds, ``and I
think that's how he's always worked. Terms like `blockbuster' and
`multibillion' are obviously there, but they're never present when
you're filming a scene.
 &HT;    ``You do feel that you're doing your job while surrounded by a
group of people who really know what they're doing, and that it's a
group led by a man who's on top of every detail,'' he says.
``George is, literally, physically and in every other way, in
charge.
 &HT;    ``There are no suits, there's no studio pressure _ there's just
George, and that allowed us to concentrate on the essence of the
film.''
 &HT;    Between stints McDiarmid found time to act in a BBC adaptation
of ``Great Expectations'' and in the upcoming feature film ``Sleepy
Hollow,'' directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp,
Christina Ricci and Christopher Walken. He also shepherded the
Almeida's revival of ``Plenty,'' which features Cate Blanchett and
opened on the West End in late April.
 &HT;    While he appreciates the opportunities and paydays that
television and film present _ his screen credits include
``Dragonslayer'' (1981), ``Gorky Park'' (1983) and ``Restoration''
(1995) _ theater is the medium closest to McDiarmid's heart. He's
starred in ``The Doctor's Dilemma,'' ``Volpone'' and ``Tartuffe,''
and for the Almeida he has directed ``Scenes from an Execution''
and an opera, ``Siren Song,'' among others.
 &HT;    ``I've been with the Almeida for 10 years,'' says McDiarmid, who
in October will star as Barabas in the company's production of
``The Jew of Malta.'' ``We've basically decided on plays, contacted
the artists and, by and large, they've said, `Count me in.'
 &HT;    ``We've been lucky,'' he says. ``We've expanded beyond our
little 300-seat theater here and are producing shows at other
theaters in London and around the world, including on Broadway.
 &HT;    ``We needed to scare ourselves, to refresh ourselves,'' he
concludes. ``And taking our work to more places and to more people
accomplishes that.''
 &HT;    McDiarmid's work will take a quantum leap with the release of
``Phantom Menace.'' Millions upon millions of people worldwide will
see him in action, and he'll be far more recognizable than he was
in ``Return of the Jedi.'' Even McDiarmid can only speculate about
the consequences.
 &HT;    ``On `Jedi' I had the anonymity of the makeup, and that's not
the case here,'' says the actor, who expects to appear in the
second and third episodes, though he hasn't officially signed to do
so. ``Whatever happens, I will just go on being me.
 &HT;    ``I'm not moving, I'll still run the Almeida and I really doubt
that anything will change too dramatically,'' he says. ``I like to
use the tube and to stop and shop, and I hope that doesn't
change.''
 &HT;    McDiarmid takes a final sip of water.
 &HT;    ``Come back to me in six months, when the film has been released
just about everywhere,'' he says. ``Then I'll tell you how things
are going.''

 Includes a color slide of Cher in a scene from ``Tea With
Mussolini.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    In Hollywood there are comebacks and then there are comebacks
... and then there's Cher.
 &HT;    In salvaging her career after the end of Sonny and Cher's 15
minutes of fame in the 1970s, in reinventing herself as a solo
singer and an Oscar-winning actress, the former Cherilyn Sarkisian
LaPierre had already earned a spot in the Comeback Hall of Fame.
 &HT;    But by the mid-1990s, as she moved into her 50s, the clock
seemed to have struck midnight once again. Her records weren't
selling, the long-delayed release of ``Faithful'' (1996) more or
less torpedoed her movie career and a series of infomercials had
made her into a late-night-television punchline.
 &HT;    There might not be anywhere to go but up, but no one was
expecting to hear much more from Cher.
 &HT;    Fast-forward: It's 1999, and on the eve of her 53rd birthday
Cher has a smash album with ``Believe,'' a multimillion selling
single of the same name _ No. 1 in 23 countries around the world _
and a hot-ticket summer concert tour. And she's receiving great
notices for her role in Franco Zeffirelli's ``Tea With Mussolini,''
opening nationwide throughout May and June.
 &HT;    ``See what happens when I take a big rest?'' she jokes. ``I'm
like John Travolta _ I come back big.''
 &HT;    In person she hides behind her dark, mile-long hair like some
kind of shield. Her voice is sweet and low, with a warm laugh and a
motherly nature that peppers her conversation with frequent
``honeys'' and ``sweeties.''
 &HT;    She's glamorous but approachable. Her fans regularly come up and
greet her by her first name _ not that they have a lot of choice _
and start conversations. The most common question, she says, is
``Where have you been for so long?''
 &HT;    It's a good question.
 &HT;    ``I designed houses, and what else did I do?'' she says
thoughtfully. ``I started a catalog company. I did some
infomercials, which I do regret.''
 &HT;    She pauses.
 &HT;    ``I just did stuff.''
 &HT;    She's still doing stuff _ it's just higher-profile stuff,
including her return to the big screen as American adventuress Elsa
Morganthal in ``Tea With Mussolini.''
 &HT;    Based on Zeffirelli's own childhood, the $14 million film
centers on a young boy raised in 1930s Italy by three eccentric
Englishwomen (Judi Dench, Joan Plowright and Maggie Smith). Elsa is
a former Ziegfeld dancer who deals in modern art and dallies in
free love.
 &HT;    ``I think of her like spice,'' the actress says. ``She yells and
screams and flirts. And then she leaves and changes and improves
herself.''
 &HT;    It's an offbeat, interesting role for a woman who won an Oscar
as Best Actress for ``Moonstruck'' (1987), but of late has had
difficulty finding parts that intrigued her, in large part because
of her age.
 &HT;    ``The last few years, I've realized that there aren't many movie
roles for me out there,'' she says matter-of-factly. ``I don't care
how good you look. Jack Nicholson now plays opposite Helen Hunt.
It's not like anyone wanted to cast me with Brad Pitt.
 &HT;    ``That's the way it is in Hollywood,'' she says with a shrug.
``If I've learned one thing over the years, it's that you can't
argue with the way things are. You can just do what you can do to
change your little spot.''
 &HT;    And often there is little that can be done. Since 1985, Cher has
suffered from the Epstein-Barr virus, a cause of infectious
mononucleosis and other energy-draining diseases.
 &HT;    ``There were times I was so sick that I thought I was going to
die,'' she says.
 &HT;    Then she laughs, as if to dispel any hint of despair.
 &HT;    ``Look, I've been working since I was 16 years old, and that's a
long time,'' she says. ``It's just tiring to be in the public eye
for that long. That's why I wanted to take off for awhile _ I need
a break from being Cher.''
 &HT;    She laughs again.
 &HT;    ``You know, it's a busy job being Cher,'' she jokes. ``Sometimes
it's even a pain in the a-- being her.''
 &HT;    Holistic herbal remedies, acupuncture and oxygen therapy have
helped her recover, she believes. Her youthful appearance is also
in part attributable to plastic surgery, which has generated rumors
of everything from cheek and eye work to reports that she has had
two ribs removed and her belly button reshaped.
 &HT;    ``It's no one's business,'' she says.
 &HT;    In the past she's admitted to having had her nose, breasts and
teeth reworked, but she won't comment on anything more. Well,
except those stories about her famous cheekbones.
 &HT;    ``I've had the same cheekbones since birth,'' she says firmly.
 &HT;    When she thinks about it, Cher adds, the tabloid fascination
with gossip and rumormongering infuriates her.
 &HT;    ``I think Hollywood is a much meaner-spirited place now than
when I started,'' she says. ``People are always looking for the
dirt.
 &HT;    ``I don't want to see pictures of Hugh Grant inside his bedroom
window or Liz Hurley with no makeup on,'' she adds angrily. ``I
don't want to say, `Oh God, she doesn't look good today.' It's
trash information. I don't need to bother my brain with it.''
 &HT;    For her own part, she insists that it doesn't matter. Even the
media coverage of her eulogy to her late ex-husband Sonny Bono
didn't faze her, she says.
 &HT;    ``I've never cared what they said about me,'' she says flatly.
 &HT;    On the other hand, there are benefits to being Cher,
opportunities which she's only too happy to take advantage of.
 &HT;    Most people celebrate reaching the half-century mark with a cake
and maybe a few presents. Cher's 50th birthday involved helicopter
landings, boats and a French chateau.
 &HT;    ``I was staying with a friend of mine on his boat in Cannes,''
she recalls. ``On my birthday, a friend of mine who has a chateau
gave this huge party and all these people were brought in.''
 &HT;    ``Brought in,'' of course, means flown in specially for the
occasion.
 &HT;    ``On helicopters,'' she says, laughing at the lavishness of it
all. ``It was the most jet-setty I ever get. I mean, I wanted to
stay home on my birthday, but there I was watching all these
helicopters landing on the lawn, and I thought, `This is so totally
cool.'
 &HT;    ``I thought, `If this is as bad as it gets at 50, it's not so
bad!'''
 &HT;    And actually, it's gotten better since then. The record, the hit
single, the tour and now the movie have all added up to a midlife
renaissance for Hollywood's comeback queen.
 &HT;    It's even brought her a new generation of fans, she reports _ no
surprise to one of the most fan-friendly stars around.
 &HT;    ``It seems to me that I give good vibes and I get them back,''
she says. ``People kind of instinctively think they like me. That's
the best part of being Cher.''
 &HT;    Of course, those fans are sometimes surprised that the person
they meet isn't the feather-encrusted, rhinestone-studded glamor
queen they've seen on the Oscars, the talk shows or the concert
stage.
 &HT;    ``I think people would be surprised to know that I'm very soft
in a certain way,'' she says. ``It's just that you can't be too
soft and survive in my world.
 &HT;    ``If you were too soft, you would just be crying all the time.''

 Includes a color slide of Lucy Lawless in a scene from ``Xena:
Warrior Princess.'' 
 By MICHAEL LOGAN  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Appearances, as anyone who's ever ridden into an apparently
peaceful village sometime in the mist-shrouded past can attest, can
be deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   Take ``Xena: Warrior Princess'' and its star, Lucy Lawless, who
has emerged as an unlikely feminist icon.
</P>
<P>
   Lawless has created one of the most imposing, strikingly
original looks in television history. You know the getup _ swinging
sword, leather toga, sexy breastplate and those butt-kicking,
high-heeled boots that send her already considerable height _
5-foot-10-inches _ into the Amazonian ozone. And then there's the
formidable, deeply bronzed bod and that impossibly thick mane of
Cher hair.
</P>
<P>
   But look beneath the surface, and you're in for a surprise.
Minus wig and warrior wardrobe, La Lawless is jaw-droppingly
delicate. She is slender, even slight, and when not covered in
head-to-toe Xena makeup she has a porcelain-white complexion even a
china doll might envy.
</P>
<P>
   The New Zealand-born cult heroine is also remarkably
down-to-earth, chummy and vulnerable _ like someone who could be
your next-door neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I am somebody's next-door neighbor,'' Lawless says over a
light lunch of pita bread, Middle Eastern dips and Diet Coke. ``We
all live next door to somebody. Being normal is no big deal where I
come from _ it's just not in our national character to get carried
away with ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get out of line in New Zealand, we're only too ready to
say, `Who the hell do you think you are?'''
</P>
<P>
   It took several seasons of ``Xena'' for Lawless to get
comfortable with her status as a female role model.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first it felt like a burden, like a yoke I couldn't carry,
and I shunned it,'' she says. ``During our first season Ms.
magazine put me on its cover _ at the very time I was trapped in
the horror of being a role model. It was very disconcerting.
</P>
<P>
   ``But eventually I came to see it can be really pleasant, that
people aren't expecting more of me _ just that I be human.''
</P>
<P>
   Her own heroines, she adds, don't wear steel and leather.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm tempted to think of myself as successful, I think of
our housekeeper,'' the 31-year-old says. ``She's from El Salvador,
where her father was kidnapped and there were attempted kidnappings
of others in her family. She has endured so much pain, so much
hell, and yet she has still discovered the secret of joy _ her cup
is always half full.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at her and think, `Wow, now you are a truly successful
human being.'''
</P>
<P>
   If the actress is thinking more about home and family than she
used to, that's understandable. Lawless and her husband of one
year, ``Xena'' executive producer Rob Tapert, are expecting a baby
in October. But don't panic, fans _ a ``Xena'' spokesperson says
the pregnancy will be hidden ``creatively'' and won't affect
production in any way.
</P>
<P>
   The actress also has a 10-year-old daughter, Daisy, from her
marriage to computer expert Garth Lawless, whom she divorced three
years ago. Because ``Xena'' often takes her to the wilds of New
Zealand, Daisy lives with her father during the week and spends
weekends and school vacations with her mom and Tapert in their Los
Angeles home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The juggling isn't easy, but we make the best of it,'' Lawless
says. ``Garth is a hands-on, excellent father. We have a very
cooperative relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The actress intends to pursue movie work when ``Xena''
eventually ends its run, but insists that having a good marriage
and a large family matters more to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to choose, I'd go for family over Oscars any day,''
she says. ``If I didn't, I'd kick myself when I'm 80.''
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't always seen things that way, she adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an early age, I was very aware of my mortality and felt
pressured to do-do-do, achieve-achieve-achieve,'' she recalls. ``As
a Catholic kid, I was obsessed with the last part of `Hail, Mary' _
you know, `Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at
the hour of our death, Amen.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like, `Our death? What do you mean, death?' When you're
6, that's a hell of a concept. So I was always in a terrible
hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   The turning point came in 1996, when she fell off a horse while
performing a stunt for ``The Tonight Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I broke my pelvis in four places,'' Lawless recalls. ``The
best thing that came of that physical breakdown was that it made me
stop and put my fears in order. It made me realize what's really
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Another crisis overtook her last year, during an arduous,
six-episode ``Xena'' arc that was shot during bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in snow and rain and cold for months,'' she recalls,
``and I started to have what is called a neural association, where
you associate work with physical discomfort. My nonstop thought
that whole time was `I am in pain!'
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not bear to get up one more morning and put on that
yucky brown makeup one more time,'' she says. ``It got to the point
where I could not even speak about work at home or I would cringe _
which is a real problem when you're married to the producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``So then, by association, home became a bad thing. I was a
mess.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Xena was rescued by ... Leeza Gibbons?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at a really low point one morning, just mindlessly
flipping channels, when a Leeza infomercial caught my eye,''
Lawless says. ``I thought, `Hmm, what's Leeza have to tell me
today?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, she was selling tapes by (motivational guru) Tony
Robbins and I went `Oh, hell, why not? I've got to do something to
pull myself out of this.' So I swallowed my pride and bought some
self-help tapes.''
</P>
<P>
   To her surprise and delight, they worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I nipped it in the bud,'' Lawless says, ``before I lost
everything, including the respect of my colleagues and possibly my
marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the secret was coming to terms with her own success, she
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tempting when you're in my position, with people tying
your bootlaces and holding an umbrella over your head when it's
hot, to think you are special,'' the actress explains. ``You can
start believing your own publicity and thinking you have feelings
other people can't possibly understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come to see that practicing appreciation and gratitude is
the way to health and happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   She's particularly appreciative of the unlikely circumstances
which brought her together with the American-born Tapert, who also
produces ``Hercules: The Legendary Journeys,'' the show that
introduced Xena.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role landed in my lap because no American actress would
take it,'' Lawless says. ``Nobody wanted to miss the Hollywood
pilot season and go to an unknown, funny country to act on an
unproven show _ because at that point `Hercules' wasn't yet a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result,'' she concludes, ``I got two things I didn't
expect _ the role of a lifetime and a husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawless admits that her new mother-in-law wasn't expecting
someone like her, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``She always used to say to Rob, `Now, why don't you bring home
a nice girl like that Morgan Fairchild?'''

FOLK HEROES: PETER, PAUL AND MARY TUNE UP FOR THE NEXT MILLENNIUM

 Includes a color slide of folk singers Peter Yarrow, Paul Stookey
and Mary Travers. 
 By BONNIE SIEGLER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's been almost four decades since three folk singers combined
talents for a concert at Greenwich Village's Bitter End coffee
house, and Peter, Paul and Mary are still going strong.
 &HT;    Their latest album, ``Songs of Conscience and Concern'' (Warner
Bros.), is their 21st, a collection of old songs focusing on the
political and social themes for which they are best known. But
instead of a ``greatest hits'' album, they have chosen to sing
lesser-known songs that they feel deserved a wider audience, and
one new song, ``Don't Laugh at Me,'' whose message seems especially
appropriate in the wake of the tragedy in Littleton, Colo.
 &HT;    ``All of our music has a certain ethical bottom line,'' says
Mary Travers, now 59 and a grandmother. ``The sense of human
dignity in this song, reminding people that we are all entitled to
a certain level of respect, is what drew us to it.''
 &HT;    Peter, Paul and Mary _ the other two-thirds are Peter Yarrow and
Noel ``Paul'' Stookey _ do sing a lot of their old hits in concert,
but even there they try to make at least a third of their songs new
material, in deference to audiences which includes decades-long
fans and newcomers alike.
 &HT;    ``When we first began singing, we were singing to people our age
and younger,'' Travers says by telephone from her Connecticut home.
``They grew up and became mommies, daddies and grandparents.''
 &HT;    After all these years, and despite the $30,000 to $50,000 that
they reportedly command per concert, Travers says the songs
themselves are still the group's purpose.
 &HT;    ``It was to sing these songs, to be able to put your passion
where your mouth was,'' she says. ``I did, and I'm still doing
it.''
 &HT;    She'll admit that the trio has sung such hits as ``Puff The
Magic Dragon'' and ``Blowin' In The Wind'' ``trillions of times''
since they first sang them in 1962, but insists that there's
nothing wrong with that. ``Blowin' in the Wind'' still resonates
for her as much as it ever did.
 &HT;    ``It's still an immensely powerful song,'' the folksinger says.
``All I have to do is remind myself what's happening with the
Serbs. Fundamentally, it's dealing with classical issues _ we're
always going to have to talk about human rights, and each
generation fights the good fight. The fight never ends.''
 &HT;    Speaking by telephone from his Manhattan apartment, Yarrow
seconds the motion.
 &HT;    ``There's a phrase in Yiddish that says `Tikkun olam,''' he
says, ``which means you don't ascribe to yourself the task of
saving the world, but you cannot shrink from doing your part. That
characterizes our sense of commitment.
 &HT;    ``As an artist, I feel a sense of completion when I speak to
somebody whose life has been affected by our music or folk music in
general,'' Yarrow says. ``Once a young man said to me that he sang
`The Great Mandala,' that I wrote, to a judge when he was to be
sentenced.''
 &HT;    He cites ``Blowin' In The Wind'' or ``Where Have All The Flowers
Gone,''' which they sang at the legendary 1965 civil-rights march
in Selma, Ala., as among the group's most powerful songs.
 &HT;    ``But our songs are no longer songs per se,'' he adds. ``They
are symbols of hopes and dreams, written in blood and pain. What
identifies Peter, Paul and Mary up to this point is we have been
together longer than any other performing act that has achieved
this recognition.''
 &HT;    During the 1960s, for a relatively brief period, the three were
major pop stars. Today their records sell steadily, but they are
most active as live performers, outside the mainstream of the music
industry where stars such as Celine Dion, Lauryn Hill and Marilyn
Manson rule. Which, Travers says, is fine.
 &HT;    ``Folk music survives without the commercial machinery,'' she
says. ``It's more a grassroots thing. People want moments of lapsed
cynicism, they want moments when they feel a sense of community.
It's a specific well that people can go back to.''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, she says, she pays attention to the stars of today,
and sees folk influences all over the charts.
 &HT;    ``Rap music is nothing new,'' she says with a laugh. ``We call
it, in folk music, `the talking blues.' It's been around for over
150 years _ Woody Guthrie wrote a wonderful rap song about unions
decades ago.
 &HT;    ``There are a ton of young singers who have borrowed from folk _
Sheryl Crow, Alanis Morissette _ and I like to listen to them,
along with my opera music.''
 &HT;    Yarrow won't condemn today's music either, though he admits to
some reservations about what he hears on the radio.
 &HT;    ``I see rap music as very narcissistic, negative and
inflammatory,'' he says. ``That frequently comes from manipulators,
like a street version of Jerry Springer, but uglier. Some rap music
is a cry from a disenfranchised population.
 &HT;    ``But I can't make a categorical decision on rap either,'' he
adds. ``There have been very stylish folk songs written, too, just
to make money. Art is always something to be evaluated one person
at a time.''
 &HT;    Calling from his Maine farm, Stookey notes that the social and
political climate has changed around the trio.
 &HT;    ``We live in more pragmatic times than when we originally
recorded those '60s songs,'' he says. ``But many of the dreamers of
the '60s have been elected to governmental office or taken on
leadership in their communities.''
 &HT;    It was Stookey who was the impetus behind the group's breakup in
1970.
 &HT;    ``Yes, I wanted to explore more of my spiritual side,'' says
Stookey, who has been an evangelical Christian since 1969, an
outlook reflected in his post-breakup music, most notably the
popular ``Wedding Song.''
 &HT;    After the split, Travers continued to record, as well as
producing, writing and starring in a BBC television series. Yarrow
devoted his energies to political activism _ ``it's what keeps my
motor running and keeps me young,'' he says.
 &HT;    None was as successful solo, but Travers says the time apart
from each other was important nonetheless.
 &HT;    ``We needed that time,'' she says, ``because we were just tired.
We were doing 190 concerts a year.''
 &HT;    ``We were only human and, as so, we have human foibles,'' Yarrow
adds. ``But if the people only wanted to hear our old songs, we
would have stayed broken up.''
 &HT;    The three reunited in 1978 for an anti-nuclear benefit that
Yarrow helped organize at the Hollywood Bowl. And, while each
remains active in his or her individual concerns, they've been
working together periodically ever since.
 &HT;    ``We hadn't sung together in six years or so,'' Travers recalls.
``We realized that we'd missed each other, personally and
musically, and wanted to work together again. Simply put, when we
hit the stage, we seek the best of each other.''

<P>
   When Olivier Blanchard, a liberal economist at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, is asked why unemployment rates are higher
in Europe than in the United States, he likes to tell audiences
about a pamphlet he saw in a British library: ``Leaving School:
What You Need to Know About Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   His point: Europe's cradle-to-grave safety net means not only
that being out of work has become a viable way of making a living,
but that there is no longer much stigma attached to joblessness.
That goes a long way in explaining the contrast between America's
current jobs boom and the contrasting jobs bust in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Not that long ago, the best and brightest young American
economists were churning out papers with titles like, ``Why Is U.S.
Unemployment So High at Full Employment?'' As recently as five
years ago, slow job growth, downsizing and shrinking paychecks
loomed large in America's psyche, and in 1992 Lester C. Thurow's
book ``Head to Head: The Coming Economic Battle Among Japan,
America and Europe,'' hailing the superiority of the European and
Japanese economic models, was atop the best-seller lists.
</P>
<P>
   Not any more. Today, American blacks, long afflicted by
double-digit unemployment rates, are less likely to be out of work
than Europeans. For the first time in memory, the U.S. jobless rate
has dipped below that of Japan, where until recently lifetime
employment was taken for granted. What's more, U.S. pay and
productivity are rising handily.
</P>
<P>
   What's behind America's jobs miracle? And why have long-time
world beaters suddenly turned into apparent deadbeats?
</P>
<P>
   Part of the answer is that America's economy is booming. A
surprisingly tame inflation rate has allowed the Federal Reserve,
which controls the amount of money in circulation and thus the
spending power of companies that create jobs, to avoid raising
interest rates _ even as joblessness has dropped to the lowest
level in 30 years. The rate for April, released last week, barely
inched up, from 4.2 percent to 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the economies of Japan and Europe are stagnating.
Japan has been mired in a recession that's lasted about as long as
America's eight-year expansion. While the stagnation was initially
caused by a financial meltdown, says the economist Paul Krugman in
his new book, ``The Return of Depression Economics,'' the main
problem now is that Japan's central bank, fearing inflation, is
unwilling to pump enough money into the economy to lift spending _
and create jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Tight monetary policy is also holding back job growth in Europe.
``Alan Greenspan is willing to push the economy along until he sees
inflation actually picking up,'' says Krugman, referring to the
Federal Reserve chairman, ``but the European Central Bank isn't
giving unemployment a chance to get down.''
</P>
<P>
   But tight monetary policy isn't the main culprit in Europe.
Rather, it's that various safety-net programs over the years have
made not working a viable way of life, especially for young workers
and those who are approaching retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Blanchard and Justin Wolfers of Harvard University, co-authors
of several studies of European labor markets, point to two
especially pernicious institutions. One is the web of restrictions
on layoffs. Even though these rules and regulations are no longer
as numerous or effective as they were a decade ago _ Europe, like
America, has discovered temps _ they are still powerful enough to
have a chilling effect on companies' willingness to hire. As a
result, workers who lose jobs find it very difficult to get new
ones, and rising unemployment doesn't have the normal, healthy
effect of reining in labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger problem is the nature of unemployment benefits. Partly,
it's their generosity. In Sweden, where the unemployment rate has
jumped from a minuscule 1.4 percent to 5.6 percent in the last
decade, unemployed workers can collect nearly 80 percent as much as
if they were working, compared with about 50 percent in the United
States and Japan. In Spain, it's 70 percent (until recently it was
90 percent) and in France it's nearly 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The extent to which generous unemployment benefits inhibit job
growth depends partly on the proportion of workers who are
eligible: Only about one-third of workers who are out of work
qualify for benefits in the United States and Japan, where newer
members of the labor force and temporary workers are ineligible.
Compare that with 89 percent of unemployed workers in Germany and
98 percent in France.
</P>
<P>
   What matters even more is how long benefits can be collected.
Unemployment benefits in Germany are equal to only 36 percent of a
prior paycheck but an ex-worker can collect for at least five
years. In Britain, unemployed people can collect practically
forever. In the United States and Japan, by contrast, the limit is
26 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But if Europe's generous safety net is the key problem, how come
it has taken so long for the chickens to come home to roost? After
all, the welfare state has been in place since the 1950s and '60s,
when full employment was the norm. One explanation, say Blanchard
and Wolfers, is that until the '70s there were few economic jolts
like oil shocks that buffeted rich countries in 1973, 1979 and
1990. ``Shocks displace people, but institutions like
unemployment-benefit programs determine how many people get
displaced and for how long,'' Wolfers said.

entertainment package.)

 Includes a color slide of Ian McDiarmid in a scene from ``Star
Wars: The Phantom Menace.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Pop quiz: Who are the three actors who play the same characters
in ``Star Wars: The Phantom Menace'' that they did in the original
``Star Wars'' trilogy?
 &HT;    Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, of course. And Kenny Baker as R2D2,
that makes two. And then there's ... well, there's ... hmmm.
 &HT;    Time's up _ the third would be Ian McDiarmid, the veteran
Scottish actor and staple of the London stage who portrayed the
ghostly, enigmatic and aged Emperor Palpatine in ``Return of the
Jedi'' (1983). He'll reprise the role in George Lucas' ``Phantom
Menace'' when the film opens nationwide on May 19.
 &HT;    Though a repentant Darth Vader heaved the Emperor into the
cosmic void in ``Jedi,'' ``The Phantom Menace'' unfolds nearly 40
years before that event, setting the stage for the 50-something
McDiarmid's return engagement.
 &HT;    The actor had heard via the ``Star Wars'' grapevine that
Palpatine might be involved in the prequel, but only after months
of rumors were those reports confirmed.
 &HT;    ``George Lucas called,'' McDiarmid says, chatting over a bottle
of sparkling water at the bar of the Almeida Theatre, the
prestigious London theater for which he serves as co-artistic
director. ``I hadn't seen George in 15 years, but he asked me to
meet him at a hotel.
 &HT;    ``We got together,'' he continues, ``and I recall that he said,
`Would you like a drink?' I ordered a water, and then he said, `Do
you know anybody who might want to play the Emperor?' And I said,
`Funny you should ask.'
 &HT;    ``He said, `Well, great. Welcome back, if that's what you'd like
to do.'
 &HT;    ``That's how George is,'' McDiarmid says with a chuckle. ``He
gets an idea about something or somebody and follows it through.''
 &HT;    In the $115 million epic, McDiarmid plays the pivotal role of
Senator Palpatine, the principal representative of Queen Amidala
(Natalie Portman), the teen-age ruler of the beleaguered planet
Naboo.
 &HT;    Anyone who remembers Palpatine from ``Return of the Jedi'' won't
have much trouble figuring out that he's up to no good.
 &HT;    ``Palpatine is a politician, and that alone should tell you
volumes about him,'' McDiarmid says with a laugh, stroking his
salt-and-pepper goatee and looking less than evil in jeans and a
black-and-green plaid shirt.
 &HT;    ``I could stop right there, but will say that he's doing the
best he can for his queen and his planet,'' he adds. ``Like all
politicians, however, he is not entirely unaffected by matters of
self-interest.
 &HT;    ``Now, there I shall stop.''
 &HT;    McDiarmid, who is single and lives in the Notting Hill section
of London, knew many of his fellow actors prior to filming. Liam
Neeson (Qui-Gon Jinn) had starred as Oscar Wilde in the Almeida
production of ``The Judas Kiss,'' while Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan
Kenobi) is the nephew of McDiarmid's old friend Denis Lawson, who
played the small role of pilot Wedge Antilles in the first three
``Star Wars'' adventures. Frank Oz (Yoda) directed McDiarmid in the
comedy ``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels'' (1988).
 &HT;    He hadn't previously known Portman, with whom he shares most of
his scenes.
 &HT;    ``Poor Natalie had to deal with a lot,'' he says
sympathetically. ``She's got wonderful makeup and wonderful
costumes, many of them, but some of the costumes were very heavy.
And the headdresses were extremely heavy.
 &HT;    ``The headdresses were often very high up and revolved
backward,'' he says, ``but Natalie came through it wonderfully
well. She's a real professional, and at such a young age.''
 &HT;    ``Phantom Menace'' was an incredibly elaborate film to make,
with lavish sets, intricate costumes and literally thousands of
special effects that would be added digitally after the actors'
work was done.
 &HT;    Even after the shoot, McDiarmid wasn't done. For more than a
year afterward _ and as little as two months before the film's
release _ McDiarmid was still re-recording dialogue and even
shooting new scenes.
 &HT;    But McDiarmid says that Lucas kept everything on an even keel.
 &HT;    ``He's pretty much the same on the set as he is off it,'' the
actor says. ``He's relaxed, friendly and a bit shy. I liked that. I
like George.
 &HT;    ``He made it seem, despite the enormous size of the whole thing,
that we were a small group doing a movie,'' McDiarmid adds, ``and I
think that's how he's always worked. Terms like `blockbuster' and
`multibillion' are obviously there, but they're never present when
you're filming a scene.
 &HT;    ``You do feel that you're doing your job while surrounded by a
group of people who really know what they're doing, and that it's a
group led by a man who's on top of every detail,'' he says.
``George is, literally, physically and in every other way, in
charge.
 &HT;    ``There are no suits, there's no studio pressure _ there's just
George, and that allowed us to concentrate on the essence of the
film.''
 &HT;    Between stints McDiarmid found time to act in a BBC adaptation
of ``Great Expectations'' and in the upcoming feature film ``Sleepy
Hollow,'' directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp,
Christina Ricci and Christopher Walken. He also shepherded the
Almeida's revival of ``Plenty,'' which features Cate Blanchett and
opened on the West End in late April.
 &HT;    While he appreciates the opportunities and paydays that
television and film present _ his screen credits include
``Dragonslayer'' (1981), ``Gorky Park'' (1983) and ``Restoration''
(1995) _ theater is the medium closest to McDiarmid's heart. He's
starred in ``The Doctor's Dilemma,'' ``Volpone'' and ``Tartuffe,''
and for the Almeida he has directed ``Scenes from an Execution''
and an opera, ``Siren Song,'' among others.
 &HT;    ``I've been with the Almeida for 10 years,'' says McDiarmid, who
in October will star as Barabas in the company's production of
``The Jew of Malta.'' ``We've basically decided on plays, contacted
the artists and, by and large, they've said, `Count me in.'
 &HT;    ``We've been lucky,'' he says. ``We've expanded beyond our
little 300-seat theater here and are producing shows at other
theaters in London and around the world, including on Broadway.
 &HT;    ``We needed to scare ourselves, to refresh ourselves,'' he
concludes. ``And taking our work to more places and to more people
accomplishes that.''
 &HT;    McDiarmid's work will take a quantum leap with the release of
``Phantom Menace.'' Millions upon millions of people worldwide will
see him in action, and he'll be far more recognizable than he was
in ``Return of the Jedi.'' Even McDiarmid can only speculate about
the consequences.
 &HT;    ``On `Jedi' I had the anonymity of the makeup, and that's not
the case here,'' says the actor, who expects to appear in the
second and third episodes, though he hasn't officially signed to do
so. ``Whatever happens, I will just go on being me.
 &HT;    ``I'm not moving, I'll still run the Almeida and I really doubt
that anything will change too dramatically,'' he says. ``I like to
use the tube and to stop and shop, and I hope that doesn't
change.''
 &HT;    McDiarmid takes a final sip of water.
 &HT;    ``Come back to me in six months, when the film has been released
just about everywhere,'' he says. ``Then I'll tell you how things
are going.''

BY THE NUMBERS: SCIENCE LOOKS AT LITTLETON, AND SHRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The bullets were still ricocheting off the lockers
at Columbine High School when the accusations began to fly. Clues
were ignored: Gothic music, black trench coats, video games
spelling combat with a K. The sheriffs missed the Web site ravings.
The psychiatrist missed the hidden rage. The parents missed the
pipe bombs. If only somebody had spotted the warning signs, a
terrible tragedy might have been averted.
</P>
<P>
   That is a comforting thought for a nation scarred and grieving.
But viewed through the prism of science, it isn't necessarily true.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if there is anything left to be said about the recent
tragedy in Littleton, Colo., it may be this: the cold, hard reality
of the deadliest school massacre in American history is that it was
the statistical equivalent of a needle in a haystack.
</P>
<P>
   Because such events are so rare, and because it is impossible to
eliminate risk from life, there may be no larger lessons to draw,
and no way to prevent another one.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the numbers. Homicide is the second-leading cause of
death among youngsters. But according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, fewer than 1 percent of child homicides
occur in or around schools. While the number of school shootings
with multiple victims _ the kind that attract intense media
attention _ has risen recently, from an average of 2 to an average
of 5 a year, the annual total has declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that schools are very safe environments for our
kids,'' said Dr. Jim Mercy, associate director for science in the
division of violence prevention at the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very hard to predict or identify ahead of time the
kinds of kids and the constellation of factors that are likely to
lead to this kind of event,'' he added. ``They are so rare, and
there are so many school kids, and our understanding of what
motivates people to be violent is so imprecise, that this would be
a very difficult task.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is the impulse to analyze, to understand, to
prevent. In the wake of disasters like Littleton, where two
teen-age gunmen killed 13 people and then themselves, sociologists,
psychologists and criminal justice experts are interrogated by the
media in a collective search for societal failures, in much the
same way that aviation investigators look for jammed rudders or
ruptured fuel lines after an airplane crash.
</P>
<P>
   But risk cannot be eliminated. Fine surgeons still kill
patients. Tornados still wipe out towns. ``There is a lot of
randomness in the world,'' said Dr. John D. Graham, director of the
Center for Risk Analysis at the Harvard University School of Public
Health. ``Part of understanding risk is understanding that things
are not fully explainable and not reducible to zero.''
</P>
<P>
   That is true of air crashes, and it is true of school shootings.
Last week, when state attorneys general gathered in Jackson, Miss.,
for a two-day conference on youth violence, officials from
Littleton delivered a sobering message: They had long been in a
good position to prevent the Columbine massacre. Their county
already had one of the few juvenile assessment centers in the
country. Its population is affluent and well educated. Children get
a good education and health care. And one of the gunmen, Eric
Harris, was already seeing a psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   Still, 15 people died. Most took that as disturbing evidence
that a good system had failed. Dr. Arnold Barnett, professor of
statistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says it
may mean the opposite: a good system worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might represent one aberrant case,'' Barnett said. ``Even
measures that are highly successful, that 99.9 percent of the time
will defuse potential tragedies, will every now and then break
down. People seek higher meanings and seek major failures to
produce major tragedies like this. But it doesn't always work that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the vast number of schoolchildren who report carrying
guns, it is surprising that such shootings do not occur more often.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 5.9
percent of the 15 million high school students said they carried a
gun in the 30 days prior to a recent survey. ``And yet,'' said Dr.
Jeffrey Fagan, director of the Center for Violence Research and
Prevention at Columbia University in New York, ``they don't
shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start thinking about risk,'' Fagan said, ``it changes
the conversation from the culture war that is going on now about
video games, parental supervision and the alienation of the
suburbs. It changes it to a much more hard-headed approach that
says, `Sometimes bad things happen and we can't always explain
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   When public health experts look at risks to young people,
homicides, which account for 14 percent of all deaths among
children, come in second. The biggest threat is accidents,
primarily car crashes, which are responsible for 42 percent of
childhood deaths. Graham says there is a danger to the ``emotional
gush'' over Littleton: ``It diverts energies from the big risks
that adolescents face, which are binge drinking, traffic crashes,
unprotected sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet people yearn for explanations, and it is disturbing to
entertain the possibility that not everything is within their
control.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to believe that they live in a just world, for
their own sake and sanity,'' said Dr. Melvin Lerner, a retired
professor of psychology at the University of Waterloo in Ontario.
``When faced with obvious horrible things, we go out looking for
people to blame.''
</P>
<P>
   They also look for patterns. The Columbine massacre was the
sixth multiple-victim school shooting in the past 18 months. If
there are common threads, said Fagan, it is that each involved
firearms, undiagnosed mental illness and longstanding grievances on
the part of the gunmen. ``Any one of these three risks separately
does not produce a violent event,'' he said. ``It's their
convergence and interaction that produces an event.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, the CDC has devoted considerable attention
to investigating violence as a public health threat, trying to
examine the trends. But its research has only scratched the
surface, providing information about the who, what, where and when
of school shootings, but little insight as to why.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists now know that between July 1, 1992, and June 30,
1994, two-thirds of school shooting victims were students; of the
children killed, 83 percent were boys. The deaths occurred in 25
states, in communities of all sizes. But fewer than one-third of
the shootings, 28 percent, occurred inside school. ``What we were
not able to do,'' said Mercy, ``was a psychological profile of the
offenders, to look at the commonalities.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a well-known story about the London doctor John Snow,
who traced an outbreak of cholera to one pump spouting tainted
water. He removed the pump handle. It didn't clean up the water,
but it ended the epidemic. In the same way, said Dr. Alfred
Blumstein, director of the National Consortium on Violence Research
at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, there is a simple way
to address school shootings: eliminate access to guns. ``Guns,'' he
said, ``transform what is widespread teen-age behavior into
disasters.''
</P>
<P>
   One might also eliminate video games, or the Internet, or shut
down schools or institutionalize troubled children. But that would
simply create other risks, Graham said, like unsupervised or truant
children. Yet even in the absence of solutions, said Lerner, the
search may still be useful. ``One could make a good case,'' he
said, ``that it is the only rational response.''

CHER AND CHER ALIKE: SHE'S BACK, ON SCREEN AND ON CD 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 Includes a color slide of Cher in a scene from ``Tea With
Mussolini.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    In Hollywood there are comebacks and then there are comebacks
... and then there's Cher.
 &HT;    In salvaging her career after the end of Sonny and Cher's 15
minutes of fame in the 1970s, in reinventing herself as a solo
singer and an Oscar-winning actress, the former Cherilyn Sarkisian
LaPierre had already earned a spot in the Comeback Hall of Fame.
 &HT;    But by the mid-1990s, as she moved into her 50s, the clock
seemed to have struck midnight once again. Her records weren't
selling, the long-delayed release of ``Faithful'' (1996) more or
less torpedoed her movie career and a series of infomercials had
made her into a late-night-television punchline.
 &HT;    There might not be anywhere to go but up, but no one was
expecting to hear much more from Cher.
 &HT;    Fast-forward: It's 1999, and on the eve of her 53rd birthday
Cher has a smash album with ``Believe,'' a multimillion selling
single of the same name _ No. 1 in 23 countries around the world _
and a hot-ticket summer concert tour. And she's receiving great
notices for her role in Franco Zeffirelli's ``Tea With Mussolini,''
opening nationwide throughout May and June.
 &HT;    ``See what happens when I take a big rest?'' she jokes. ``I'm
like John Travolta _ I come back big.''
 &HT;    In person she hides behind her dark, mile-long hair like some
kind of shield. Her voice is sweet and low, with a warm laugh and a
motherly nature that peppers her conversation with frequent
``honeys'' and ``sweeties.''
 &HT;    She's glamorous but approachable. Her fans regularly come up and
greet her by her first name _ not that they have a lot of choice _
and start conversations. The most common question, she says, is
``Where have you been for so long?''
 &HT;    It's a good question.
 &HT;    ``I designed houses, and what else did I do?'' she says
thoughtfully. ``I started a catalog company. I did some
infomercials, which I do regret.''
 &HT;    She pauses.
 &HT;    ``I just did stuff.''
 &HT;    She's still doing stuff _ it's just higher-profile stuff,
including her return to the big screen as American adventuress Elsa
Morganthal in ``Tea With Mussolini.''
 &HT;    Based on Zeffirelli's own childhood, the $14 million film
centers on a young boy raised in 1930s Italy by three eccentric
Englishwomen (Judi Dench, Joan Plowright and Maggie Smith). Elsa is
a former Ziegfeld dancer who deals in modern art and dallies in
free love.
 &HT;    ``I think of her like spice,'' the actress says. ``She yells and
screams and flirts. And then she leaves and changes and improves
herself.''
 &HT;    It's an offbeat, interesting role for a woman who won an Oscar
as Best Actress for ``Moonstruck'' (1987), but of late has had
difficulty finding parts that intrigued her, in large part because
of her age.
 &HT;    ``The last few years, I've realized that there aren't many movie
roles for me out there,'' she says matter-of-factly. ``I don't care
how good you look. Jack Nicholson now plays opposite Helen Hunt.
It's not like anyone wanted to cast me with Brad Pitt.
 &HT;    ``That's the way it is in Hollywood,'' she says with a shrug.
``If I've learned one thing over the years, it's that you can't
argue with the way things are. You can just do what you can do to
change your little spot.''
 &HT;    And often there is little that can be done. Since 1985, Cher has
suffered from the Epstein-Barr virus, a cause of infectious
mononucleosis and other energy-draining diseases.
 &HT;    ``There were times I was so sick that I thought I was going to
die,'' she says.
 &HT;    Then she laughs, as if to dispel any hint of despair.
 &HT;    ``Look, I've been working since I was 16 years old, and that's a
long time,'' she says. ``It's just tiring to be in the public eye
for that long. That's why I wanted to take off for awhile _ I need
a break from being Cher.''
 &HT;    She laughs again.
 &HT;    ``You know, it's a busy job being Cher,'' she jokes. ``Sometimes
it's even a pain in the a-- being her.''
 &HT;    Holistic herbal remedies, acupuncture and oxygen therapy have
helped her recover, she believes. Her youthful appearance is also
in part attributable to plastic surgery, which has generated rumors
of everything from cheek and eye work to reports that she has had
two ribs removed and her belly button reshaped.
 &HT;    ``It's no one's business,'' she says.
 &HT;    In the past she's admitted to having had her nose, breasts and
teeth reworked, but she won't comment on anything more. Well,
except those stories about her famous cheekbones.
 &HT;    ``I've had the same cheekbones since birth,'' she says firmly.
 &HT;    When she thinks about it, Cher adds, the tabloid fascination
with gossip and rumormongering infuriates her.
 &HT;    ``I think Hollywood is a much meaner-spirited place now than
when I started,'' she says. ``People are always looking for the
dirt.
 &HT;    ``I don't want to see pictures of Hugh Grant inside his bedroom
window or Liz Hurley with no makeup on,'' she adds angrily. ``I
don't want to say, `Oh God, she doesn't look good today.' It's
trash information. I don't need to bother my brain with it.''
 &HT;    For her own part, she insists that it doesn't matter. Even the
media coverage of her eulogy to her late ex-husband Sonny Bono
didn't faze her, she says.
 &HT;    ``I've never cared what they said about me,'' she says flatly.
 &HT;    On the other hand, there are benefits to being Cher,
opportunities which she's only too happy to take advantage of.
 &HT;    Most people celebrate reaching the half-century mark with a cake
and maybe a few presents. Cher's 50th birthday involved helicopter
landings, boats and a French chateau.
 &HT;    ``I was staying with a friend of mine on his boat in Cannes,''
she recalls. ``On my birthday, a friend of mine who has a chateau
gave this huge party and all these people were brought in.''
 &HT;    ``Brought in,'' of course, means flown in specially for the
occasion.
 &HT;    ``On helicopters,'' she says, laughing at the lavishness of it
all. ``It was the most jet-setty I ever get. I mean, I wanted to
stay home on my birthday, but there I was watching all these
helicopters landing on the lawn, and I thought, `This is so totally
cool.'
 &HT;    ``I thought, `If this is as bad as it gets at 50, it's not so
bad!'''
 &HT;    And actually, it's gotten better since then. The record, the hit
single, the tour and now the movie have all added up to a midlife
renaissance for Hollywood's comeback queen.
 &HT;    It's even brought her a new generation of fans, she reports _ no
surprise to one of the most fan-friendly stars around.
 &HT;    ``It seems to me that I give good vibes and I get them back,''
she says. ``People kind of instinctively think they like me. That's
the best part of being Cher.''
 &HT;    Of course, those fans are sometimes surprised that the person
they meet isn't the feather-encrusted, rhinestone-studded glamor
queen they've seen on the Oscars, the talk shows or the concert
stage.
 &HT;    ``I think people would be surprised to know that I'm very soft
in a certain way,'' she says. ``It's just that you can't be too
soft and survive in my world.
 &HT;    ``If you were too soft, you would just be crying all the time.''

 Includes a color slide of Lucy Lawless in a scene from ``Xena:
Warrior Princess.'' 
 By MICHAEL LOGAN  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Appearances, as anyone who's ever ridden into an apparently
peaceful village sometime in the mist-shrouded past can attest, can
be deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   Take ``Xena: Warrior Princess'' and its star, Lucy Lawless, who
has emerged as an unlikely feminist icon.
</P>
<P>
   Lawless has created one of the most imposing, strikingly
original looks in television history. You know the getup _ swinging
sword, leather toga, sexy breastplate and those butt-kicking,
high-heeled boots that send her already considerable height _
5-foot-10-inches _ into the Amazonian ozone. And then there's the
formidable, deeply bronzed bod and that impossibly thick mane of
Cher hair.
</P>
<P>
   But look beneath the surface, and you're in for a surprise.
Minus wig and warrior wardrobe, La Lawless is jaw-droppingly
delicate. She is slender, even slight, and when not covered in
head-to-toe Xena makeup she has a porcelain-white complexion even a
china doll might envy.
</P>
<P>
   The New Zealand-born cult heroine is also remarkably
down-to-earth, chummy and vulnerable _ like someone who could be
your next-door neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I am somebody's next-door neighbor,'' Lawless says over a
light lunch of pita bread, Middle Eastern dips and Diet Coke. ``We
all live next door to somebody. Being normal is no big deal where I
come from _ it's just not in our national character to get carried
away with ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get out of line in New Zealand, we're only too ready to
say, `Who the hell do you think you are?'''
</P>
<P>
   It took several seasons of ``Xena'' for Lawless to get
comfortable with her status as a female role model.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first it felt like a burden, like a yoke I couldn't carry,
and I shunned it,'' she says. ``During our first season Ms.
magazine put me on its cover _ at the very time I was trapped in
the horror of being a role model. It was very disconcerting.
</P>
<P>
   ``But eventually I came to see it can be really pleasant, that
people aren't expecting more of me _ just that I be human.''
</P>
<P>
   Her own heroines, she adds, don't wear steel and leather.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm tempted to think of myself as successful, I think of
our housekeeper,'' the 31-year-old says. ``She's from El Salvador,
where her father was kidnapped and there were attempted kidnappings
of others in her family. She has endured so much pain, so much
hell, and yet she has still discovered the secret of joy _ her cup
is always half full.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at her and think, `Wow, now you are a truly successful
human being.'''
</P>
<P>
   If the actress is thinking more about home and family than she
used to, that's understandable. Lawless and her husband of one
year, ``Xena'' executive producer Rob Tapert, are expecting a baby
in October. But don't panic, fans _ a ``Xena'' spokesperson says
the pregnancy will be hidden ``creatively'' and won't affect
production in any way.
</P>
<P>
   The actress also has a 10-year-old daughter, Daisy, from her
marriage to computer expert Garth Lawless, whom she divorced three
years ago. Because ``Xena'' often takes her to the wilds of New
Zealand, Daisy lives with her father during the week and spends
weekends and school vacations with her mom and Tapert in their Los
Angeles home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The juggling isn't easy, but we make the best of it,'' Lawless
says. ``Garth is a hands-on, excellent father. We have a very
cooperative relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The actress intends to pursue movie work when ``Xena''
eventually ends its run, but insists that having a good marriage
and a large family matters more to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to choose, I'd go for family over Oscars any day,''
she says. ``If I didn't, I'd kick myself when I'm 80.''
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't always seen things that way, she adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an early age, I was very aware of my mortality and felt
pressured to do-do-do, achieve-achieve-achieve,'' she recalls. ``As
a Catholic kid, I was obsessed with the last part of `Hail, Mary' _
you know, `Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at
the hour of our death, Amen.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like, `Our death? What do you mean, death?' When you're
6, that's a hell of a concept. So I was always in a terrible
hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   The turning point came in 1996, when she fell off a horse while
performing a stunt for ``The Tonight Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I broke my pelvis in four places,'' Lawless recalls. ``The
best thing that came of that physical breakdown was that it made me
stop and put my fears in order. It made me realize what's really
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Another crisis overtook her last year, during an arduous,
six-episode ``Xena'' arc that was shot during bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in snow and rain and cold for months,'' she recalls,
``and I started to have what is called a neural association, where
you associate work with physical discomfort. My nonstop thought
that whole time was `I am in pain!'
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not bear to get up one more morning and put on that
yucky brown makeup one more time,'' she says. ``It got to the point
where I could not even speak about work at home or I would cringe _
which is a real problem when you're married to the producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``So then, by association, home became a bad thing. I was a
mess.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Xena was rescued by ... Leeza Gibbons?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at a really low point one morning, just mindlessly
flipping channels, when a Leeza infomercial caught my eye,''
Lawless says. ``I thought, `Hmm, what's Leeza have to tell me
today?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, she was selling tapes by (motivational guru) Tony
Robbins and I went `Oh, hell, why not? I've got to do something to
pull myself out of this.' So I swallowed my pride and bought some
self-help tapes.''
</P>
<P>
   To her surprise and delight, they worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I nipped it in the bud,'' Lawless says, ``before I lost
everything, including the respect of my colleagues and possibly my
marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the secret was coming to terms with her own success, she
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tempting when you're in my position, with people tying
your bootlaces and holding an umbrella over your head when it's
hot, to think you are special,'' the actress explains. ``You can
start believing your own publicity and thinking you have feelings
other people can't possibly understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come to see that practicing appreciation and gratitude is
the way to health and happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   She's particularly appreciative of the unlikely circumstances
which brought her together with the American-born Tapert, who also
produces ``Hercules: The Legendary Journeys,'' the show that
introduced Xena.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role landed in my lap because no American actress would
take it,'' Lawless says. ``Nobody wanted to miss the Hollywood
pilot season and go to an unknown, funny country to act on an
unproven show _ because at that point `Hercules' wasn't yet a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result,'' she concludes, ``I got two things I didn't
expect _ the role of a lifetime and a husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawless admits that her new mother-in-law wasn't expecting
someone like her, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``She always used to say to Rob, `Now, why don't you bring home
a nice girl like that Morgan Fairchild?'''

 UNDATED: Wolfers said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Europe, many displaced workers stay out of work longer, and
bad things happen when a large group of people stay out of the work
force for a long time. Lawrence Katz, a labor economist at Harvard,
says that reducing the stigma attached to joblessness has profound
effects on the labor market. In Sweden, which combined extremely
low joblessness with extremely generous welfare programs, someone
who got laid off used to be ashamed to admit it to his or her
neighbors. Now, with a new generation of workers less imbued with
that work ethic, much of that shame has evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   There are other negative effects as well. Workers who don't get
rehired fast also lose skills and, more importantly, connections.
Since most hiring is by word of mouth, people who don't know others
with jobs find it hard to get one themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The flaws of the welfare state are compounded by other forms of
government intervention, says Alan B. Krueger, an economist at
Princeton University. One important reason American workers get
hired at such surprising rates is that it's much easier to start
new businesses in the United States. In Austria, Krueger says,
someone who wants to open a pharmacy must get permission from the
other drugstores in town.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, it boils down to social choices. ``One
can say the Europeans have made a political decision that they are
unwilling to tolerate as much income inequality as in the United
States,'' Katz said. ``But equity comes at the cost of job
creation.''
</P>
<P>
   Even today, men in their prime working years are not faring much
worse in Europe or Japan than in the United States. But in America,
which excels at absorbing new workers, other groups like the young,
immigrants and women are faring much better. Now the U.S. economy
is absorbing workers with the least education and the fewest
skills, including ones who have been out of the work force for
years and written off as lost causes.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, choices made decades ago are preventing a similar
expansion in the work force. &QL;

 Includes a color slide of folk singers Peter Yarrow, Paul Stookey
and Mary Travers. 
 By BONNIE SIEGLER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's been almost four decades since three folk singers combined
talents for a concert at Greenwich Village's Bitter End coffee
house, and Peter, Paul and Mary are still going strong.
 &HT;    Their latest album, ``Songs of Conscience and Concern'' (Warner
Bros.), is their 21st, a collection of old songs focusing on the
political and social themes for which they are best known. But
instead of a ``greatest hits'' album, they have chosen to sing
lesser-known songs that they feel deserved a wider audience, and
one new song, ``Don't Laugh at Me,'' whose message seems especially
appropriate in the wake of the tragedy in Littleton, Colo.
 &HT;    ``All of our music has a certain ethical bottom line,'' says
Mary Travers, now 59 and a grandmother. ``The sense of human
dignity in this song, reminding people that we are all entitled to
a certain level of respect, is what drew us to it.''
 &HT;    Peter, Paul and Mary _ the other two-thirds are Peter Yarrow and
Noel ``Paul'' Stookey _ do sing a lot of their old hits in concert,
but even there they try to make at least a third of their songs new
material, in deference to audiences which includes decades-long
fans and newcomers alike.
 &HT;    ``When we first began singing, we were singing to people our age
and younger,'' Travers says by telephone from her Connecticut home.
``They grew up and became mommies, daddies and grandparents.''
 &HT;    After all these years, and despite the $30,000 to $50,000 that
they reportedly command per concert, Travers says the songs
themselves are still the group's purpose.
 &HT;    ``It was to sing these songs, to be able to put your passion
where your mouth was,'' she says. ``I did, and I'm still doing
it.''
 &HT;    She'll admit that the trio has sung such hits as ``Puff The
Magic Dragon'' and ``Blowin' In The Wind'' ``trillions of times''
since they first sang them in 1962, but insists that there's
nothing wrong with that. ``Blowin' in the Wind'' still resonates
for her as much as it ever did.
 &HT;    ``It's still an immensely powerful song,'' the folksinger says.
``All I have to do is remind myself what's happening with the
Serbs. Fundamentally, it's dealing with classical issues _ we're
always going to have to talk about human rights, and each
generation fights the good fight. The fight never ends.''
 &HT;    Speaking by telephone from his Manhattan apartment, Yarrow
seconds the motion.
 &HT;    ``There's a phrase in Yiddish that says `Tikkun olam,''' he
says, ``which means you don't ascribe to yourself the task of
saving the world, but you cannot shrink from doing your part. That
characterizes our sense of commitment.
 &HT;    ``As an artist, I feel a sense of completion when I speak to
somebody whose life has been affected by our music or folk music in
general,'' Yarrow says. ``Once a young man said to me that he sang
`The Great Mandala,' that I wrote, to a judge when he was to be
sentenced.''
 &HT;    He cites ``Blowin' In The Wind'' or ``Where Have All The Flowers
Gone,''' which they sang at the legendary 1965 civil-rights march
in Selma, Ala., as among the group's most powerful songs.
 &HT;    ``But our songs are no longer songs per se,'' he adds. ``They
are symbols of hopes and dreams, written in blood and pain. What
identifies Peter, Paul and Mary up to this point is we have been
together longer than any other performing act that has achieved
this recognition.''
 &HT;    During the 1960s, for a relatively brief period, the three were
major pop stars. Today their records sell steadily, but they are
most active as live performers, outside the mainstream of the music
industry where stars such as Celine Dion, Lauryn Hill and Marilyn
Manson rule. Which, Travers says, is fine.
 &HT;    ``Folk music survives without the commercial machinery,'' she
says. ``It's more a grassroots thing. People want moments of lapsed
cynicism, they want moments when they feel a sense of community.
It's a specific well that people can go back to.''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, she says, she pays attention to the stars of today,
and sees folk influences all over the charts.
 &HT;    ``Rap music is nothing new,'' she says with a laugh. ``We call
it, in folk music, `the talking blues.' It's been around for over
150 years _ Woody Guthrie wrote a wonderful rap song about unions
decades ago.
 &HT;    ``There are a ton of young singers who have borrowed from folk _
Sheryl Crow, Alanis Morissette _ and I like to listen to them,
along with my opera music.''
 &HT;    Yarrow won't condemn today's music either, though he admits to
some reservations about what he hears on the radio.
 &HT;    ``I see rap music as very narcissistic, negative and
inflammatory,'' he says. ``That frequently comes from manipulators,
like a street version of Jerry Springer, but uglier. Some rap music
is a cry from a disenfranchised population.
 &HT;    ``But I can't make a categorical decision on rap either,'' he
adds. ``There have been very stylish folk songs written, too, just
to make money. Art is always something to be evaluated one person
at a time.''
 &HT;    Calling from his Maine farm, Stookey notes that the social and
political climate has changed around the trio.
 &HT;    ``We live in more pragmatic times than when we originally
recorded those '60s songs,'' he says. ``But many of the dreamers of
the '60s have been elected to governmental office or taken on
leadership in their communities.''
 &HT;    It was Stookey who was the impetus behind the group's breakup in
1970.
 &HT;    ``Yes, I wanted to explore more of my spiritual side,'' says
Stookey, who has been an evangelical Christian since 1969, an
outlook reflected in his post-breakup music, most notably the
popular ``Wedding Song.''
 &HT;    After the split, Travers continued to record, as well as
producing, writing and starring in a BBC television series. Yarrow
devoted his energies to political activism _ ``it's what keeps my
motor running and keeps me young,'' he says.
 &HT;    None was as successful solo, but Travers says the time apart
from each other was important nonetheless.
 &HT;    ``We needed that time,'' she says, ``because we were just tired.
We were doing 190 concerts a year.''
 &HT;    ``We were only human and, as so, we have human foibles,'' Yarrow
adds. ``But if the people only wanted to hear our old songs, we
would have stayed broken up.''
 &HT;    The three reunited in 1978 for an anti-nuclear benefit that
Yarrow helped organize at the Hollywood Bowl. And, while each
remains active in his or her individual concerns, they've been
working together periodically ever since.
 &HT;    ``We hadn't sung together in six years or so,'' Travers recalls.
``We realized that we'd missed each other, personally and
musically, and wanted to work together again. Simply put, when we
hit the stage, we seek the best of each other.''

DISASTERS' NEWS VALUE NOT SOLELY DETERMINED BY NUMBER OF DEATHS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Between the roar of an Amtrak train crash in March and
the rampage of tornadoes last Monday, there was a terribly quiet
moment in Arkansas last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   An amphibious boat filled with 21 tourists began taking on water
on Lake Hamilton, just outside Hot Springs. Thirty seconds later it
disappeared below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The accident killed 13 people, two more than died in the Amtrak
crash outside of Chicago on March 15. But unlike those victims, or
the 15 who died in the massacre at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., or the more than 40 who died in the tornadoes in
Oklahoma and Kansas, the people who drowned spent only an instant
in a national consciousness ever restless for greater grief and
higher drama. Like the boat itself, news of the accident sank
without a trace.
</P>
<P>
   The national television networks, including CNN and MSNBC, ran
reports of only a few minutes, deep into their broadcasts. Regional
newspapers in Dallas, Memphis, ran front-page articles, but none of
the national newspapers did. Although The New York Times ran the
train accident on its front page, the boat accident ran inside.
</P>
<P>
   There were, of course, a few other things going on in the world
that Saturday afternoon. The Rev. Jesse Jackson was leading three
U.S. prisoners of war out of Yugoslavia. The bombing was continuing
in Kosovo, and the national meditation over Littleton went on.
</P>
<P>
   But the Arkansas boating accident serves as a reminder that
while people may be created equal, they do not necessarily die that
way. On the swiftly calculated sliding scale of death, accidents
are assigned a news value based not on how many lives were lost,
but on how and where they happened to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us make any bones about this _ pictures really
matter,'' said Erik Sorenson, vice president and general manager of
MSNBC. ``In this case, the boat vanished. And we had a rather
tranquil-looking water top. In the train wreck, we had a very
large, quite mangled Amtrak train lying on its side, and that's a
much more compelling photograph, whether for a newspaper or an
Internet site or a television program.''
</P>
<P>
   But visuals aren't everything. For journalists, a disaster is
more interesting if people can imagine themselves within it. Just
as a school-bus crash in Kentucky will get far more U.S. coverage
than a deadly monsoon in Bangladesh that kills hundreds, so too
will a death during a commonplace activity take precedence over a
more obscure one, like boating.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a large degree, coverage is determined by editors asking
themselves, how likely is it that this accident could happen to me
or my readers?'' said James Kelly, the deputy managing editor of
Time, which did not cover the boating accident. ``And there are a
lot of people who take trains, and not that many who take tour
boats.''
</P>
<P>
   The news media have never pretended to a mathematical
consistency in what they cover. The longest-lasting stories require
a mystery or a forceful narrative, which is why the Littleton
shootings have prompted so much examination than any of the 12
deaths attributed to youth violence that occur, on average, every
day. But even by that standard, the silence in Arkansas seemed
eerie. None of the amphibious boats has ever had a fatality in
nearly 40 years of use. When death did occur _ possibly because of
a leaky rubber seal on the hull _ it seemed as if the victims were
cheated of their rightful national ritual in which their families'
grief would be displayed.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, James Patton, whose parents and sister died on
the boat, paid tribute to them in a very personal way at their
funeral Wednesday in Ames, Okla. Accompanying a recording of Lynyrd
Skynyrd's ``Free Bird,'' the 15-year-old boy played his drum set at
the gravesite. The Associated Press was the only national news
organization to send a reporter. The cameras were 50 miles away,
filming storm rubble.

BY THE NUMBERS: SCIENCE LOOKS AT LITTLETON, AND SHRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The bullets were still ricocheting off the lockers
at Columbine High School when the accusations began to fly. Clues
were ignored: Gothic music, black trench coats, video games
spelling combat with a K. The sheriffs missed the Web site ravings.
The psychiatrist missed the hidden rage. The parents missed the
pipe bombs. If only somebody had spotted the warning signs, a
terrible tragedy might have been averted.
</P>
<P>
   That is a comforting thought for a nation scarred and grieving.
But viewed through the prism of science, it isn't necessarily true.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if there is anything left to be said about the recent
tragedy in Littleton, Colo., it may be this: the cold, hard reality
of the deadliest school massacre in American history is that it was
the statistical equivalent of a needle in a haystack.
</P>
<P>
   Because such events are so rare, and because it is impossible to
eliminate risk from life, there may be no larger lessons to drw,
and no way to prevent another one.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the numbers. Homicide is the second-leading cause of
death among youngsters. But according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, fewer than 1 percent of child homicides
occur in or around schools. While the number of school shootings
with multiple victims _ the kind that attract intense media
attention _ has risen recently, from an average of 2 to an average
of 5 a year, the annual total has declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that schools are very safe environments for our
kids,'' said Dr. Jim Mercy, associate director for science in the
division of violence prevention at the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very hard to predict or identify ahead of time the
kinds of kids and the constellation of factors that are likely to
lead to this kind of event,'' he added. ``They are so rare, and
there are so many school kids, and our understanding of what
motivates people to be violent is so imprecise, that this would be
a very difficult task.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is the impulse to analyze, to understand, to
prevent. In the wake of disasters like Littleton, where two
teen-age gunmen killed 13 people and then themselves, sociologists,
psychologists and criminal justice experts are interrogated by the
media in a collective search for societal failures, in much the
same way that aviation investigators look for jammed rudders or
ruptured fuel lines after an airplane crash.
</P>
<P>
   But risk cannot be eliminated. Fine surgeons still kill
patients. Tornados still wipe out towns. ``There is a lot of
randomness in the world,'' said Dr. John D. Graham, director of the
Center for Risk Analysis at the Harvard University School of Public
Health. ``Part of understanding risk is understanding that things
are not fully explainable and not reducible to zero.''
</P>
<P>
   That is true of air crashes, and it is true of school shootings.
Last week, when state attorneys general gathered in Jackson, Miss.,
for a two-day conference on youth violence, officials from
Littleton delivered a sobering message: They had long been in a
good position to prevent the Columbine massacre. Their county
already had one of the few juvenile assessment centers in the
country. Its population is affluent and well educated. Children get
a good education and health care. And one of the gunmen, Eric
Harris, was already seeing a psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   Still, 15 people died. Most took that as disturbing evidence
that a good system had failed. Dr. Arnold Barnett, professor of
statistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says it
may mean the opposite: a good system worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might represent one aberrant case,'' Barnett said. ``Even
measures that are highly successful, that 99.9 percent of the time
will defuse potential tragedies, will every now and then break
down. People seek higher meanings and seek major failures to
produce major tragedies like this. But it doesn't always work that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the vast number of schoolchildren who report carrying
guns, it is surprising that such shootings do not occur more often.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 5.9
percent of the 15 million high school students said they carried a
gun in the 30 days prior to a recent survey. ``And yet,'' said Dr.
Jeffrey Fagan, director of the Center for Violence Research and
Prevention at Columbia University in New York, ``they don't
shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start thinking about risk,'' Fagan said, ``it changes
the conversation from the culture war that is going on now about
video games, parental supervision and the alienation of the
suburbs. It changes it to a much more hard-headed approach that
says, `Sometimes bad things happen and we can't always explain
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   When public health experts look at risks to young people,
homicides, which account for 14 percent of all deaths among
children, come in second. The biggest threat is accidents,
primarily car crashes, which are responsible for 42 percent of
childhood deaths. Graham says there is a danger to the ``emotional
gush'' over Littleton: ``It diverts energies from the big risks
that adolescents face, which are binge drinking, traffic crashes,
unprotected sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet people yearn for explanations, and it is disturbing to
entertain the possibility that not everything is within their
control.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to believe that they live in a just world, for
their own sake and sanity,'' said Dr. Melvin Lerner, a retired
professor of psychology at the University of Waterloo in Ontario.
``When faced with obvious horrible things, we go out looking for
people to blame.''
</P>
<P>
   They also look for patterns. The Columbine massacre was the
sixth multiple-victim school shooting in the past 18 months. If
there are common threads, said Fagan, it is that each involved
firearms, undiagnosed mental illness and longstanding grievances on
the part of the gunmen. ``Any one of these three risks separately
does not produce a violent event,'' he said. ``It's their
convergence and interaction that produces an event.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, the CDC has devoted considerable attention
to investigating violence as a public health threat, trying to
examine the trends. But its research has only scratched the
surface, providing information about the who, what, where and when
of school shootings, but little insight as to why.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists now know that between July 1, 1992, and June 30,
1994, two-thirds of school shooting victims were students; of the
children killed, 83 percent were boys. The deaths occurred in 25
states, in communities of all sizes. But fewer than one-third of
the shootings, 28 percent, occurred inside school. ``What we were
not able to do,'' said Mercy, ``was a psychological profile of the
offenders, to look at the commonalities.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a well-known story about the London doctor John Snow,
who traced an outbreak of cholera to one pump spouting tainted
water. He removed the pump handle. It didn't clean up the water,
but it ended the epidemic. In the same way, said Dr. Alfred
Blumstein, director of the National Consortium on Violence Research
at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, there is a simple way
to address school shootings: eliminate access to guns. ``Guns,'' he
said, ``transform what is widespread teen-age behavior into
disasters.''
</P>
<P>
   One might also eliminate video games, or the Internet, or shut
down schools or institutionalize troubled children. But that would
simply create other risks, Graham said, like unsupervised or truant
children. Yet even in the absence of solutions, said Lerner, the
search may still be useful. ``One could make a good case,'' he
said, ``that it is the only rational response.''

GRANTING CLEMENCY: BEING IN THE WRONG PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)

   SAN FRANCISCO _ It is a bad time to be on death row.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians win points _ and votes _ by wearing the
tough-on-crime banner. In this environment, granting clemency has
become an act of courage that requires an outlay of political
capital few governors are willing to spend.
</P>
<P>
   Not that clemency has ever been a good bet: 544 inmates have
been executed and 39 granted clemency in the 23 years since the
U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty. But given the
current political climate, clemency is nearly impossible. It is no
accident, political experts say, that 14 of the 39 prisoners spared
death (including one in Alabama this year) were awarded clemency by
three governors leaving office.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the inmate who faces a clemency decision from a
governor in the heat of political battle, or from one who is new
and trying to prove himself, is as good as dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a governor new in office, especially a Democrat trying to
establish law-and-order credentials, clemency is not an option,''
said Franklin Zimring, a professor of law at the University of
California at Berkeley. ``The political pressure to deny clemency
is overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Manuel Babbitt, a Vietnam veteran with a Purple
Heart and a history of mental illness. Thousands of veterans asked
California Gov. Gray Davis to spare him, but he was executed last
week for the 1980 murder of an elderly woman.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, California's first Democratic governor in 16 years,
promised to give his fellow Vietnam veterans due respect when he
took office in January, but he also had campaigned as a supporter
of the death penalty. Babbitt was only his second clemency case.
</P>
<P>
   In his 14-page explanation denying clemency, Davis discounted or
ignored the strongest reasons for mercy, including affidavits from
two jurors who said they would have voted against the death penalty
if evidence omitted from the trial had been included. While Davis
had already rejected the first clemency plea to cross his desk,
that of a Thai Buddhist priest convicted of two murders, a single
execution was not enough for a new governor trying to establish his
law-and-order reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to have several executions under his belt to establish
his credentials,'' Zimring said. ``He could write a lengthy paper
describing why he made his decision, but in the end, the truth is
he was not going to grant clemency.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent events in Missouri underscore how even a well-timed
clemency can backfire. In January, in a much-publicized case, Gov.
Mel Carnahan commuted the sentence of an admitted triple murderer
after Pope John Paul II, who was visiting St. Louis, asked him to
do so. The governor, a moderate Democrat who is hoping to unseat
Republican incumbent Sen. John Ashcroft in 2000, had allowed more
than two dozen executions to go forward, and announced that his act
of mercy was a ``one-time event.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the governor's opponents promptly began making political
hay. Senator Ashcroft held a victims' rights hearing in St. Louis,
inviting as star witnesses the members of the family killed by the
man Carnahan spared. Polls showed that the governor's clemency
would cost him four times as many votes for the Senate as he would
gain. All four of the clemency appeals to pass his desk since then
have been denied.
</P>
<P>
   Governors in the 38 states with a death penalty are not likely
to grant clemency except in cases of ``actual innocence,'' said
Daniel Kobil, a law professor at Capital University in Columbus,
Ohio. Clemency enables governors to commute a death sentence for
many reasons, legal experts say, including the rehabilitation of a
prisoner or extenuating circumstances that were not brought out in
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, governors often deny clemency by saying they will not
second-guess the wisdom of courts and juries, Kobil said. ``I think
it's a perversion of the governor's clemency power to say this,''
he said. ``It makes clemency just another appeal, when the
executive is supposed to consider whether this punishment is fair
given all the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Only when the public begins to punish politicians for not
exercising their clemency power will the pattern change, Kobil
said. In 1960, for example, when polls showed that only 50 percent
of the public favored executions, one in four cases was commuted.
But by the mid-1960s, support for the death penalty was growing.
</P>
<P>
   California Gov. Edmund G. Brown Sr. was unseated by Ronald
Reagan largely for commuting 23 death sentences from 1958 to 1966,
although he had allowed 36 executions at the same time. Brown's
son, Jerry, suffered his worst political defeat as governor in the
early 1980s after appointing three anti-death-penalty justices to
the Supreme Court. They were later ousted in an unprecedented
ballot initiative. His sister, Kathleen, lost her 1994 challenge to
then-incumbent Gov. Pete Wilson over her opposition to the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is likely to face more clemency pleas than any other
governor before him, or any other governor in the country.
California has more than 500 inmates on death row. At some point,
he will probably grant clemency, said Zimring. But not soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the pope had been in California in January,'' he said,
``his plea for mercy would have been denied.''

DISASTERS' NEWS VALUE NOT SOLELY DETERMINED BY NUMBER OF DEATHS

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Between the roar of an Amtrak train crash in March and
the rampage of tornadoes last Monday, there was a terribly quiet
moment in Arkansas last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   An amphibious boat filled with 21 tourists began taking on water
on Lake Hamilton, just outside Hot Springs. Thirty seconds later it
disappeared below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The accident killed 13 people, two more than died in the Amtrak
crash outside of Chicago on March 15. But unlike those victims, or
the 15 who died in the massacre at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., or the more than 40 who died in the tornadoes in
Oklahoma and Kansas, the people who drowned spent only an instant
in a national consciousness ever restless for greater grief and
higher drama. Like the boat itself, news of the accident sank
without a trace.
</P>
<P>
   The national television networks, including CNN and MSNBC, ran
reports of only a few minutes, deep into their broadcasts. Regional
newspapers in Dallas, Memphis, ran front-page articles, but none of
the national newspapers did. Although The New York Times ran the
train accident on its front page, the boat accident ran inside.
</P>
<P>
   There were, of course, a few other things going on in the world
that Saturday afternoon. The Rev. Jesse Jackson was leading three
U.S. prisoners of war out of Yugoslavia. The bombing was continuing
in Kosovo, and the national meditation over Littleton went on.
</P>
<P>
   But the Arkansas boating accident serves as a reminder that
while people may be created equal, they do not necessarily die that
way. On the swiftly calculated sliding scale of death, accidents
are assigned a news value based not on how many lives were lost,
but on how and where they happened to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us make any bones about this _ pictures really
matter,'' said Erik Sorenson, vice president and general manager of
MSNBC. ``In this case, the boat vanished. And we had a rather
tranquil-looking water top. In the train wreck, we had a very
large, quite mangled Amtrak train lying on its side, and that's a
much more compelling photograph, whether for a newspaper or an
Internet site or a television program.''
</P>
<P>
   But visuals aren't everything. For journalists, a disaster is
more interesting if people can imagine themselves within it. Just
as a school-bus crash in Kentucky will get far more U.S. coverage
than a deadly monsoon in Bangladesh that kills hundreds, so too
will a death during a commonplace activity take precedence over a
more obscure one, like boating.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a large degree, coverage is determined by editors asking
themselves, how likely is it that this accident could happen to me
or my readers?'' said James Kelly, the deputy managing editor of
Time, which did not cover the boating accident. ``And there are a
lot of people who take trains, and not that many who take tour
boats.''
</P>
<P>
   The news media have never pretended to a mathematical
consistency in what they cover. The longest-lasting stories require
a mystery or a forceful narrative, which is why the Littleton
shootings have prompted so much examination than any of the 12
deaths attributed to youth violence that occur, on average, every
day. But even by that standard, the silence in Arkansas seemed
eerie. None of the amphibious boats has ever had a fatality in
nearly 40 years of use. When death did occur _ possibly because of
a leaky rubber seal on the hull _ it seemed as if the victims were
cheated of their rightful national ritual in which their families'
grief would be displayed.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, James Patton, whose parents and sister died on
the boat, paid tribute to them in a very personal way at their
funeral Wednesday in Ames, Okla. Accompanying a recording of Lynyrd
Skynyrd's ``Free Bird,'' the 15-year-old boy played his drum set at
the gravesite. The Associated Press was the only national news
organization to send a reporter. The cameras were 50 miles away,
filming storm rubble.

SLAPSTICK ABUSE OF ANIMALS IN MOVIES: WHY IS IT ON THE RISE? 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   In the film ``There's Something About Mary,'' a small dog flies
out a window. In ``As Good as It Gets,'' a pooch is crammed down a
trash chute. In ``EdTV,'' a love scene culminates in Matthew
McConaughey falling on a cat. In ``Men in Black,'' an alien pug
confesses after it is mercilessly shaken. Even the preview for
``Idle Hands'' shows a cat being swung around by its tail.
</P>
<P>
   For cats, dogs and other animals, life in the movies is
beginning to appear less than glamorous. Indeed, at this historical
juncture of political correctness and feeling the pain of others,
pretending to hurt animals has become an intentional laugh-getter
in movies, television and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The ad campaign of Cyberian Outpost, an online shopping site,
features gerbils being fired from an artillery cannon into a wall.
(They were actually plastic.)
</P>
<P>
   The question arises, as President Clinton prepares to meet
Monday with experts on youth violence in the wake of the Colorado
killings, how positive an influence is all this animal abuse?
</P>
<P>
   Not very, worries Dr. Pamela Sicher, president of the Children's
Mental Health Alliance Foundation. ``Is this something that
desensitizes us to the meaning of hurting living things?'' she
said. ``At what point in children's lives can they actually discern
the meaning in this?''
</P>
<P>
   The animal bashing comes at a time when other movies like
``Babe'' depict other fauna in a sympathetic, if not adorable
manner that even the most ardent animal-rights activists applaud.
Virtually all the cinematic atrocities are, of course, staged.
Animal abuse is now a felony in 23 states. Advances in robotics and
computer imaging have made it possible to simulate just about
anything. Since 1980, after a horse was killed by a dynamite
explosion in ``Heaven's Gate,'' the Screen Actors Guild contract
has required that the American Humane Association vet any scripts
involving animals. Representatives visit film sets to insure that
even rats and spiders are not mistreated. A recent New Yorker
cartoon was on the mark: It showed a studio honcho proclaiming,
``OK. Just make sure no animals are harmed in the exploding-donkey
scene.''
</P>
<P>
   But why are there exploding donkey scenes? Mainly, it seems,
because people laugh at silly humor, and animal predicaments,
particularly painful ones, are part of that time-honored genre. Dr.
Alan Manevitz, a family psychiatrist at New York Presbyterian
Hospital, suggests that the apparent abuse represents a regression
to cartoon humor of yore. Three Stooges-style slapstick, which
relies on a dose of sadism, is no longer ``politically correct with
people,'' he says. Since people know the animals are not being hurt
_ and most filmmakers run an official disclaimer from the American
Humane Association in their credits _ animal slapstick is in.
</P>
<P>
   While the humane association ignores the film content, other
groups have focused on the message. The Ark Trust, which monitors
entertainment and media for their depictions of animals, will today
televise its Genesis Awards. Among the honorees is an episode of
``Spin City,'' in which Michael J. Fox's character refuses to kill
a fawn. It is also handing out less laudatory ``Foe-Paw'' awards,
one of which will go to Outpost for its glib depiction of gerbils.
</P>
<P>
   Gretchen Wyler, president of the trust, said such scenes are no
laughing matter. ``They sort of give legitimacy to the acts,'' Ms.
Wyler said. ``It's a potential source of destructive ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Animal rights activists are fond of pointing to a study by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation that links many serial killers to
animal abuse. As a youth, Jeffrey L. Dahmer stole his neighbor's
pets and practiced taxidermy on them, keeping skulls in his yard.
Albert DeSalvo, the ``Boston Strangler,'' trapped dogs and cats in
orange crates and shot arrows through the boxes. Before Russell
Eugene Weston Jr. was charged with killing two policemen in the
U.S. Capitol last year, he reportedly shot 16 of his grandmother's
cats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually every one of these kids who ends up shooting up the
school yard has a history of animal abuse,'' said Kenneth Shapiro,
executive director of Psychologists for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals.
</P>
<P>
   The link between pretend violence on the screen and real
behavior is fuzzier. But if Manevitz is right that the appeal of
the humor is a throwback to cartoons, there seem to be grounds for
worry: A study by George Gerbner at the University of
Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for Communication found that cruel
images of animals outnumbered positive ones 12 to 1 in Saturday
morning cartoons. As to the question whether watching a violent act
has a cathartic effect on viewers _ or is more likely to spur them
to imitate it _ research has pointed toward imitation, Shapiro
said.
</P>
<P>
   And younger children surely see the famous scene in Mel Brooks'
``Blazing Saddles,'' where Alex Karras knocks out a horse with a
single punch, differently than most adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you trivialize the meaning of hurting living things, you're
doing something to the pathways by which children develop
appropriate restraints and constraints on their behavior,'' said
Sicher. ``You want them to be horrified by cruelty.''

U.S. Capitol last year, he reportedly shot 16 of his grandmother's
cats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually every one of these kids who ends up shooting up the
school yard has a history of animal abuse,'' said Kenneth Shapiro,
executive director of Psychologists for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals.
</P>
<P>
   The link between pretend violence on the screen and real
behavior is fuzzier. But if Manevitz is right that the appeal of
the humor is a throwback to cartoons, there seem to be grounds for
worry: A study by George Gerbner at the University of
Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for Communication found that cruel
images of animals outnumbered positive ones 12 to 1 in Saturday
morning cartoons. As to the question whether watching a violent act
has a cathartic effect on viewers _ or is more likely to spur them
to imitate it _ research has pointed toward imitation, Shapiro
said.
</P>
<P>
   And younger children surely see the famous scene in Mel Brooks'
``Blazing Saddles,'' where Alex Karras knocks out a horse with a
single punch, differently than most adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you trivialize the meaning of hurting living things, you're
doing something to the pathways by which children develop
appropriate restraints and constraints on their behavior,'' said
Sicher. ``You want them to be horrified by cruelty.''

COME ON BABY, FYODOR NEEDS NEW SHOES! 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the problems to be addressed or evaded in a coming report
by the National Gambling Impact Study Commission, set up by
Congress to look into the flourishing pastime, is the problem
gambler. Since any such study requires that the panelists get a
grip on the nature of the ailment, one hopes they have been
introduced to the most vivid accounts of gambling addiction in
world literature.
</P>
<P>
   They come from Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky, who for
miserable years was an unregenerate roulette punter in the casinos
of Germany. ``Oh, the way they played yesterday,'' he wrote. ``The
excitement was tremendous! If only I had some money.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason Dostoyevsky had no money for gambling at the moment,
as every member of Gamblers Anonymous can appreciate, is that as
soon as he laid hold of a few guldens, he gambled them away. Like
so many casino clients, he had a system. ``For four days, he
studied the game and the players and very quickly he came to the
conclusion that only  &UR; he  &LR;  could master this game,'' explained Geir
Kjetsaa, a biographer. ``It was so pathetically simple: All that
was required was that one play  &UR; systematically &LR;  and keep a cool
head.'' In Dostoyevsky's novel ``The Gambler,'' the
roulette-infatuated narrator detects ``a sort of order'' in the
turn of the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has observed roulette players in the throes has seen
the specimens who keep track of winning numbers on little cards
(sometimes supplied by the casino), a project that may be enough to
qualify them as casino compulsives. There are at least two
difficulties with the Dostoyevskyan analysis, which has confounded
gamblers down the years: a system for playing roulette is a wishful
enterprise to begin with, and keeping a cool head is a rare talent
in the heat of play. Certainly it defied the hysteria-prone
Dostoyevsky, even as he bought books on fail-proof systems to break
the bank. In a time when even slot-machine feeders think they have
a system, the gambling panel might consider outlawing all systems
as a form of deceptive advertising.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to his prodigiously forgiving wife, Anna,
Dostoyevsky described a progression that gamblers everywhere and in
all periods can identify with: ``To begin with I lost a little, and
then I really began to lose in earnest. I wanted to win back what I
had lost, but then I lost even more. And then I simply had to go on
playing, in order at least to get money for my homeward journey.
And then I lost everything, everything!''
</P>
<P>
   Periodically, he would assure the loyal Anna that he had
overcome a decade's passion: ``But now it is all over! This was the
 &UR; last &LR;  time!'' By the next letter, he was back at the tables.
</P>
<P>
   There, for the commission member who pays attention, is a model
of the compulsive's chronic condition.
</P>
<P>
   Kjetsaa credits Dostoyevsky's eventual ``recovery'' not to will
power but to the closing of Germany's casinos in 1872 and 1873, a
remedy that the commission, made up in part by friends of the
casino industry, is in no position to recommend. And since casinos
are not in business to produce winners, gamblers will continue,
like Dostoyevsky, to whine about losing. If the commission seeks to
stop compulsive gambling, all it need do is declare an end to
losing; winning is the cure for all gambling ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Anna saw her husband's gambling as ``an illness for which there
was no cure.'' Kjetsaa offers a more modern explanation for what he
calls a ``pathological obsession.'' He writes, ``Dostoyevsky was
possessed by an unconscious desire to lose and punish himself by
losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. Anyway, the commission, under the influence of the
therapeutic community, can be counted on to treat hard-case
gambling, along with alcoholism, drug addiction and other
unwholesome habits, as an illness. But whatever the preferred
diagnosis, the difference between Dostoyevsky and an ordinary loser
is that the writer seemed to gain creative energy from every
defeat. Kjetsaa reports that ``He never worked better than when he
had lost everything and had relieved his guilt through the
merciless punishment of the roulette wheel.'' It was after a
session of torture by the wheel in Wiesbaden that Dostoyevsky
started ``Crime and Punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many gamblers who cannot stop when they are ahead (too
common to be a pathology), Dostoyevsky was on intimate acquaintance
with the powerful lure of the sport and his own weakness. Even
watching someone else rake in a small fortune on improbable bets,
the narrator of ``The Gambler,'' set in the town of Roulettenberg,
becomes acutely conscious of his hands and knees shaking and the
blood beating in his brain. Unlike others of his sizable fraternity
of losers, however, Dostoyevsky was able to transmute his symptoms
into his writings. The gambling commission has to deal somehow with
all those driven players who can't count on that payback.

 NEWS &AMP; FEATURE SUMMARY No. 2541 - May 10, 1999 
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. UNDER THE GUN High-profile gun incidents - from the attempted
assassinations of President Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II to
school shootings such as those in Jonesboro, Arkansas and
Littleton, Colorado - provide fuel for the political debate. But
now the gun industry is sweating a new development. Frustrated by
35,000 gun-related deaths per year, gun-control proponents and
mayors from around the United States opened a potent new front :
the courts. By James Bandler. From The Boston Globe Magazine.
Full-length (4,700 words) + edited article available.
_______________________________________________________________ 2.
WHEN CHILDREN KILL In the wake of the shootings at Columbine High
School in the United States, psychiatrists say it is the fragile
children - not the sturdy ones - who are most likely to ``break''
in dramatic ways, according to a growing number of ``psychological
autopsy'' studies of youthful suicides, and from less formal
studies of adolescents who have committed murders. At the same
time, other studies have shown that the turbulence, pathology and
confusion considered ``normal'' in adolescence are, in fact, far
from typical. By Erica Goode. New York Times Science Times. 1,500
words.
</P>
<P>
   3. THE GREAT APE MASSACRE Serving a growing market for ``bush
meat,'' hunters are wiping out chimps and gorillas. Because the DNA
of chimpanzees is 98,5 per cent the same as that of humans, some
animal-rights advocates say that eating them is ``98,5 per cent
cannibalism.'' By Donald G. McNeil Jr. From The New York Times
Magazine. 1,800 words.
</P>
<P>
   4. CHRONOBIOLOGY AND SLEEP Modern man sleeps a fifth less than
he did a century ago and society is paying a high price.
Researchers who study body rhythms are finding that lack of sleep
is linked to disease and depression as well as to a disturbing rise
in transportation and industrial accidents. While few people in a
performance-oriented society seem to find time to sleep more,
partial solutions range from better work scheduling to the
imaginative application of artificial light. By Andreas Weber. From
GEO Magazine. 2,500 words. English translation available.
_______________________________________________________________
</P>
<P>
   5. WINE MAKING Blended wines, such as those cheerfully thrown
together by Californians, may turn out to be top-notch, but to a
Frenchman they will lack something special - ``terroir.'' This is a
vineyard's particular combination of dirt, rock and exposure to
sunlight that leaves an indelible mark on wine. Something,
naturally, French vintners have always known, but scientists are
just beginning to understand. By Robert Kunzig. 950 words. From
Discover Magazine.
_______________________________________________________________ 6.
NOVEL MOLECULE DISCOVERY MIGHT CREATE INSULIN PILL Diabetics may
some day take a rain-forest fungus in a pill to treat their
disease, according to pharmaceutical corporation researchers. By
Dan Vergano. From Medical Tribune News Service. 500 words.
________________________________________________________ 7. FROM
NATURE NEWS SERVICE (N/A France and Spain. Embargo : 19h00 BST
Wednesday May 12, 1999.)

<P>
   A. KEEP YOUR BABIES IN THE DARK Leaving the nursery lights on at
night might be a comfort to your young child, but could predispose
him or her to short-sightedness in later life. By Henry Gee. 500
words.
</P>
<P>
   B. IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF DINOSAURS There is more to dinosaurs than
fossilized bones. Fossilized footprints provide graphic testament
of dinosaurs as living animals. By Henry Gee. 400 words.
</P>
<P>
   8. AL GORE'S MONEY MACHINE When it comes to campaign
fund-raising, Al Gore is known as ``one of the best closers in the
business'' - especially in relation to Bill Clinton, who hates to
ask for money. And the vice president by now has raked in record
millions to support his quest for the presidency. But his talent
for fundraising could prove a dangerous habit. By Jill Abramson.
From The New York Times Magazine. (Full-length (3,650 words) +
edited article available.

 &HT;    More than art that works, it's a mouse-terpiece!
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Pity, for a moment, the abuses suffered by your
garden-variety computer mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Manhandled and squeezed by uncaring palms. Forced to run laps
around the mouse pad or crawl with exacting precision on an Excel
spreadsheet. Retrieved with a pull of the tail when it is
accidentally shooed off the desk by a clumsy hand. Often forced to
live a bland white-beige existence.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Miller, a University of Texas graduate and former Power
Computing Corp. salesman, is doing something about the unjust life
of the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   He and his partner Reid Dickson founded Custom Mouse Co., a
small operation they run from Miller's apartment. There, they make
mice with personality _ custom-designed mechanisms with color, odd
shapes and designs.
</P>
<P>
   Custom Mouse Co. has its roots in Dickson's garage, where the
two first took apart broken mice and experimented with black
leather, and later, paints and silk-screen logos. But not just any
paints _ specialty painting and silk-screen companies that work
with Custom Mouse do a three-layer paint job on the mice that
yields what you'd find on a Lexus or a BMW.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a colorful collection of mice that look ready for
the race track.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and Dickson buy mice from a supplier, then take custom
orders from companies, hoping that instead of the usual coffee mug
or key chain, companies in today's computer age will give away mice
with their company logos as promotions.
</P>
<P>
   In bulk, the mice run about $36 a piece _ about three times the
cost of a typical bargain-basement mouse. Custom Mouse has only
worked with a few clients so far, including Falcon Imaging
Solutions, but Miller hopes the company will make a splash this
year at a trade expo for the promotion industry in August.
</P>
<P>
   Colorful mice may become a booming industry _ the popularity of
Apple Computer's iMac proved there's a market for more colorful
computer goods. Miller said the small variety of computer colors in
the PC world led to his partner's idea for the company. He claims
he hasn't heard of any other company doing similar work.

 &HT;    CYBERSCENE: Meet someone new via personal Web pages
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tucked between the Web pages that sell you books, urge you to
download music, and extol the virtues of Fords and Chevrolets are
some pages that have nothing to sell. For the most part, the
designer of the page and the owner are the same person.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, these are personal Web pages. For the most part, what you
read and see on them won't help you with a term paper or provide
you with information you need at work, but it may introduce you to
some interesting people. Almost all personal Web pages have links _
usually at the bottom of the page _ that let you send e-mail to the
creator. It's a nifty way to meet people around the world (this is
the World Wide Web, remember) and, worst case, you'll probably
enjoy the old-fashioned nature of a home page. Many of them are
filled with family snapshots and stories.
</P>
<P>
   How do you find random home pages? After all, it's not like
doing a search for the gross national product of Brazil. But there
are ways, and today we'll show you some of the keys that will get
you into home pages from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a start that may keep you busy for a few days. Yahoo!
(www.yahoo.com) has a section that includes 64,000 or so personal
home pages. Just go to http://dir.yahoo.com/Society
</P>
<P>
   andCulture/People/Personal
</P>
<P>
   HomePages/ and start clicking. You'll find that this directory
is organized alphabetically. And that leads us to one of the really
entertaining things that today's adventure into the personal offers
us.
</P>
<P>
   Why not start the journey by looking up home pages by people
with your last name? Now for a person named Husted, that can be
especially entertaining. Most of the pages are in Denmark _ based
on the origin of the name _ so it offers a chance to learn about
that part of the family who stayed home. Admittedly, if you are a
Williams, Smith, Miller or Jones, the appeal may be less, but even
then you may find a distant relative in Des Moines. So click on a
letter of the alphabet and read the information that should include
the name of the page and a brief description of what it contains.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest repositories of personal home pages on the
Web is located at www
</P>
<P>
   .geocities.com. You can peruse the pages there by starting at
www.geocities.com/Avenues
</P>
<P>
   /PeopleandChat/. You'll find that the vast GeoCities site is
divided into neighborhoods. It's very similar to real-world
neighborhoods: Members select a neighborhood area for their home
page and build there.
</P>
<P>
   Since these are big neighborhoods _ true virtual cities _ you'll
need to use the search capability to find the sort of home pages
that interest you. For instance, let's say that you decide to visit
the College Park neighborhood at www.geocities
</P>
<P>
   .com/CollegePark/. Then you can use the search function (it's on
the left side of the page) to type in a search word. The name
``Husted'' brings up a list of sites that are either run by someone
named Husted, or that discuss that name. But you could just as
easily search for ``skiing'' or ``pets'' or ``games.''
</P>
<P>
   Most search engines, including AltaVista (altavista.digital.com)
have the same sort of search functions you'll find at Yahoo! or
GeoCities. But you are not limited to formal collections of
personal home pages. You can also use any search engine, type in
search words that include ``home'' and ``page'' and ``personal,''
and search out the most specialized pages easily.
</P>
<P>
   If, after spending a lazy afternoon searching other home pages,
you find that you like the charm of visiting with real people from
around the world, remember that it's fairly easy to build your own
home page and join the fun. And sites such as GeoCities offer free
space for home pages so _ if you get the building urge _ you can
soon have a home on the Web of your own.

 &HT;    Y2K COMMENTARY: Work and leisure intermingling
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With the school year winding down and the temperatures
warming up, millions of Americans are pulling out the travel
brochures to plan their summer vacation. In droves, we'll be
heading for beaches, mountains and amusement parks for a little
relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   But the simple act of relaxing is getting more complicated as
the lines blur between work and leisure. With cellular phones,
laptop computers and beepers bringing us updates from the office, a
vacation day at the beach has become less of, well, a day at the
beach. At the same time, leisure is creeping into our jobs, with
business conventions often turning into enjoyable outings and
baseball games serving as ``networking'' time with clients.
</P>
<P>
   With the distinctions between work and fun getting less clear,
sociologists, economists and other workplace observers are arguing
about the future of leisure. Some think Americans will work longer
hours in the next century, while others say we are entering a
golden age of relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   In general, this past century has brought us more fun and less
drudgery. In 1900, workers typically toiled 10 hours a day, six
days a week.
</P>
<P>
   Leisure took a leap forward in 1938 when Congress passed the
Fair Labor and Standards Act to set 40 hours as the legal workweek.
Two-week vacations became common in the post-World War II era.
</P>
<P>
   Today, slightly more than two-thirds of U.S. workers put in 40
hours or more on the job each week. In other words, for the great
majority of us, the workweek is no shorter than it was 60 years
ago. With all of the increases in productivity since then, why
haven't we gained more leisure time?
</P>
<P>
   Some economists say the workweek has not shrunk because most
Americans prefer to increase their buying power rather than expand
their relaxation time. Indeed, union leaders typically find that
workers would much rather fight for higher wages than demand
shorter hours. By sticking to a 40-hour week, we have pushed our
affluence to record heights, with home ownership rates at the
highest level in history and the average new home size growing to
twice what it was in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   But isn't it time to say enough already? The majority of us have
enough income for basics, such as food, clothing, shelter and
transportation; aren't we ready to spend more time enjoying life?
</P>
<P>
   Some sociologists argue that we already are doing just that,
even though it appears we are ``working'' long hours. For example,
we may still be sitting at our desks for 40 hours, but we are
spending much of that time making personal phone calls, playing
computer games and surfing the Internet. Web site operators say the
peak surfing time is between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. because so many
workers are entertaining themselves online.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of lunch-hour fun, more and more workers are
finding that the food in the cafeteria is _ dare we say it _ good.
Many employers are making sure their workers' breaks are filled
with Dove Bars and Starbucks coffee. Going to work in a suburban
office park can mean outdoor tables and an in-house gym.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, millions of Americans are not enjoying themselves as
they mine coal, clean toilets or pour asphalt. For them, work
remains nothing but work. But for the majority, the hours spent on
the job are getting more enjoyable because of changes that involve
air conditioning, computers and lunchroom microwave ovens.
</P>
<P>
   The issue in the new century may not be whether we will have
more leisure time or more work, but whether we will be able to tell
the difference.
</P>
<P>
   This is a weekly report by Atlanta Constitution editorial writer
Marilyn Geewax on issues raised by the coming of 2000.

 &HT;    Surveying sound systems
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sound reproduction for popular enjoyment has come a long way
since World War II, especially for people who can remember the
1940s along with 78 rpm records, record players and the tinny,
sometimes muddy, sounds that came from a single speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Today the options are numerous, from the head-rattling bass
systems youths install in cars to ``Star Wars'' banks of speakers
in family rooms. And the choices of musical sources now include
records, tapes, video cable, videotapes, satellite and DVD, the
latest technology for sharp video and digital-quality music.
</P>
<P>
   It seems like only yesterday that the ideal for serious music
listeners was ``concert hall sound,'' or sound roughly equivalent
to what you might hear in an auditorium or theater.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, we hear things never heard in concert halls _
sound bombardment from all directions, straight from the movie
theater courtesy of George Lucas and his inventive colleagues. And
the sound sources that get amplified range from records to tapes to
cable to the last word in DVD, a digital brew of pictures and
startling audio.
</P>
<P>
   The simulation of movie theater sound, sometimes called surround
sound, has become practically the heart of the audio business these
days, with aural thrill seekers shelling out up to $10,000 and more
for powerful equipment.
</P>
<P>
   If you can bear the thought of not being on the frontier,
however, experts like Tim Hurd of HiFi Buys in Atlanta, say you can
get good sound for considerably less, perhaps in the neighborhood
of $1,000 _ assuming you are starting from ground zero. A key is
that advanced electronics now allow for entertaining sound
production from smaller packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are quality speakers in a compact system that would be
goo for people getting their start in modern sound,'' Hurd said.
</P>
<P>
   Most people don't start from the beginning, however. Nearly all
music fans have at least a pair of quality speakers that are
capable of decent high- and mid-range sound reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   In launching my personal venture into surround sound, I was able
to start with a couple of DCM TimeWindow floor speakers that I've
had for nearly 20 years but still give good wide-range performance.
</P>
<P>
   The other components needed, in addition to the speakers,
include a well-engineered receiver such as a Kenwood Dolby Digital
model, available for about $400. A receiver is a combination tuner,
usually AM and FM, as well as an amplifier to drive the speakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolby Digital is a special kind of amplifier, produced by
various companies including Sony, Denon, Yamaha and others. What
makes it special is that it takes clear, accurate digital programs
from sources such as CD, certain tapes, cable or others, then
splits them into six distinct signals for the individual speakers
so the final combination of sounds envelopes the listener.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with video by way of tape or DVD, the sound can cause
the listener to ``hear'' a helicopter circling, or a twig crack
behind you, doing it so realistically that sometimes you can't help
but turn and look.
</P>
<P>
   It is a technology that can augment the action of certain movies
or give an aura of realism to programmatic music.
</P>
<P>
   DVDs or digital versatile (or ``video'' depending on who is
defining) discs provide pictures twice as clear as VHS tapes, with
CD-quality sound. This technology is so popular that stores have
trouble keeping up with demand, even at $300 and more per machine.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the sophisticated receiver, with the power to
assign sounds to individual speakers, the equipment package also
must include the right speakers. The ideal system consists of two
main speakers capable of good mid-tones and highly directional high
notes, as well as a front-center speaker to fill in and two rear
speakers also capable of a range of sounds.
</P>
<P>
   A package of speakers that fit into a system in the $1,000 range
could include Mirage AVS-200 speakers and a Mirage AVS-100 center
speaker, all designed to carry out special, complementary
assignments in the Dolby system. The small size of these speakers,
about 7 inches by 5 inches and 4 inches deep, makes them easy to
place around a modest-sized room.
</P>
<P>
   And a special feature of the modern sound system in the
surround-sound format is the sixth speaker, called a subwoofer,
that specializes in the bass or lowest sounds. While the other
speakers are powered by the receiver or main amplifier, the
subwoofer typically has its own amplifier and separate power
source. It picks up the bass signal from the receiver but draws its
power from its own electrical outlet.
</P>
<P>
   Since the bass signals consume high amounts of power, sometimes
as much as 80 percent of the power output of the receiver, the use
of a subwoofer contributes to better overall sound by relieving the
receiver of the power-consuming bass chore. Freed of that workload,
the receiver is able to devote its full power to the production of
quality mid-tones and high notes. In the sound system for $1,000,
the subwoofer has only an 8-inch speaker but also includes a
100-watt amplifier.
</P>
<P>
   Since the bass sound is nondirectional, subwoofers can be placed
virtually anywhere in the listening room. But the bigger the room,
the more bass response that is required.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way to augment this sound in a larger room is simply to
purchase a larger subwoofer,'' said Hurd of HiFi Buys.
</P>
<P>
   For listeners willing to forgo the surround sound, for a price
within the $1,000 or so range, the floor-standing speakers by
makers like Klipsch can produce very lifelike sounds that harken
back to the concert hall ideal favored by many fans of classical
music.
</P>
<P>
   Popular pairs of Klipsch speakers, with their distinctive horn
designs, are available from $650 to $1,500. Boston Acoustics,
Mirage and others produce their own floor speakers in roughly the
same price range, including some higher. Surround sound or not,
however, the only true test of personal satisfaction is to hear the
ensembles of speakers, so a visit to the dealer is highly
recommended. It's a very pleasurable assignment.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Fight for communications dollars is on
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T buys control of MediaOne, promises to provide competitive
local phone service. MediaOne, with access to the deep pockets of
AT&AMP;T, suddenly takes on the phone company to get Internet service
customers. Microsoft, yes Microsoft, a new player in
communications, steps in with software to push more entertainment
and information through your video cable.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sight to delight the eyes of federal Judge Harold Greene.
He's the bold Washington jurist who put muscle in the plan 15 years
ago to break up the monopoly of Ma Bell and usher in the era of
free-for-all competition in communications.
</P>
<P>
   What has happened since then, partly because of the new
atmosphere, has been the growth of wireless telephone
communication, lively rate competition in long-distance phone
service and the emergence of the Internet, the hottest advance in
communications history.
</P>
<P>
   But old Judge Greene, casting a sharp legal eye on this scene,
might very well see some reason for concern.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, AT&AMP;T, right before our eyes, is regaining much of
the shape and configuration that alarmed regulators and federal
trustbusters a generation ago. Moreover, we have the element of
Microsoft, already on trial on charges of being anticompetitive in
the way it uses its software dominance to squeeze out rivals.
</P>
<P>
   In a $5 billion deal with AT&AMP;T, Microsoft signed agreements that
may lead to AT&AMP;T adopting set-top boxes engineered by Microsoft,
blending Windows and WebTV technology to provide TV sets that also
act like computers.
</P>
<P>
   What Microsoft may hope to gain from its $5 billion investment
in AT&AMP;T is nothing less than a running start in the race to
dominate the cable box business. That would open a whole new
frontier for the company that already dominates computer operating
systems.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, as it has done for a long time, said last week it hopes to
use its telephone expertise and new cable properties to develop
one-stop communications services for consumers. These services
could include cable television, high-speed Internet connections and
an array of telephone services.
</P>
<P>
   With its power potentially to reach 60 percent of the national
market, more than any other single-stop provider of communications
services, AT&AMP;T raises a threat of industry domination once again,
in the eyes of consumer groups.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, AT&AMP;T argues that it can bring competition, for the
first time ever, in the local phone market and thus give consumers
a leg up on monthly communications costs.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the cable technology AT&AMP;T is hoping to provide may
put an end to the need to maintain separate phone lines for
conversations and for computers.
</P>
<P>
   Also, industry people concede that AT&AMP;T can provide the cable
business, for the first time, real expertise in telephone
technology, thus unifying the media for the benefit of all
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   However, some consumer advocates, like Mark Cooper of the
Consumer Federation of America, say the individual consumer could
lose in the huge bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Said Cooper:
</P>
<P>
   ``The costs (of the AT&AMP;T acquisition of MediaOne) are humongous
in terms of the anticompetitive effects on cable and broadband
services, and the benefits of local phone competition are
minuscule.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the AT&AMP;T words about competition are mere buzzwords will
be debated for some time among regulators, local and federal, in
the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, local phone companies like BellSouth will be fighting
the proposed merger on one front, and at the same time redoubling
efforts to upgrade their own systems to provide comprehensive
one-stop services of their own. That's a do-or-die mission for
them.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months both the local phone companies and AT&AMP;T
will be relying, to some degree, on their brand names to persuade
the public to look their way for a successful single retail
communications window.
</P>
<P>
   Each needs to be wary. It has been nearly a generation since
AT&AMP;T was truly Ma Bell, the trusted one-stop phone company. For
many young consumers AT&AMP;T may be just another phone company.
</P>
<P>
   Though BellSouth can take some pride in the local reputation for
reliability of its phone systems, the public must get used to the
idea of the phone company as provider of cablelike TV and Internet
service.
</P>
<P>
   We, as consumers, have a big task ahead in sorting through the
blizzard of ``nice deals'' that will be fired our way from a
platoon of bidders for our communications dollars.
</P>
<P>
   It will not be dull, this new millennium.

 &HT;    Palm V sticks with basic design, improves screen and software
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's expensive at $430, but the Palm V represents a big
improvement over earlier models of this hand-held computer.
</P>
<P>
   For Mac users, what's most important is that manufacturer 3Com
has finally got the PalmPilot's backup and synchronizing software
right for their platform.
</P>
<P>
   The company has successfully converted Apple Computer's old
Organizer software into a new release called MacPac 2.0. It's a
reliable and sophisticated personal information manager.
</P>
<P>
   But MacPac is no longer the only choice. Several other personal
information managers, such as Consultant and BrainForest, are also
offering versions for the Mac PalmPilot. That makes the PalmPilot
the only hand-held alternative for Mac users.
</P>
<P>
   Software is just the beginning of the improvements for Palm V.
There's nothing radically new about this latest model, which is
good news. The company has wisely decided to stick with the basic
design. What it has done is tweak the original design in important
new ways.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with the screen. One of the big problems with
earlier PalmPilots was that the screen was hard to see in dim or
direct light.
</P>
<P>
   With the Palm V, you can see the screen in almost any lighting.
Images are sharp and clear. There's a backlighting button included
with the Palm V, but you almost never need it.
</P>
<P>
   Another big change with the Palm V is that it doesn't use
batteries. Instead, you recharge it from a cradle that plugs into
the back of your Mac. It is from this cradle that you also back up
your calendar, to-do list, notes and contact list into the
Organizer software.
</P>
<P>
   One charge lasts days, if not weeks, depending on how often you
use the Palm V.
</P>
<P>
   But enough of these technical improvements. What really grabs
people about the Palm V is its looks. This PalmPilot sports a
wafer-thin, silvery body that fits snugly into any palm or pocket.
</P>
<P>
   In this design, 3Com has stolen a page from Steve Jobs' playbook
at Apple and discovered that style in designing computers is
important.

 &HT;    NETWATCHER: NPR missing boat on online shopping
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Memo to National Public Radio: Want to raise money? Think about
online shopping.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, NPR ``Weekend Edition'' anchor Scott Simon read
aloud from a children's book called ``Polka Bats and Octopus
Slacks'' by Calef Brown. Many listeners were charmed by the offbeat
nonsense poems and logged on to Amazon.com to order one or more
copies of the book for the little ones in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   But as it happened, Amazon underestimated just how many people
listen to NPR. There was a sudden flurry of requests for what was a
relatively obscure children's book. My friend Janet, who wanted
three copies, received a note from Amazon, sadly informing her
there was a ``surprise sellout.'' This is not an isolated case.
Another friend tried to order a CD featured on NPR, only to be told
of a similar ``sudden sellout.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprise? Oh please. Let's think about this for a minute, shall
we?
</P>
<P>
   It would seem to me that if you are Amazon.com and have
experienced several ``surprise sellouts,'' this might be something
you would want to look into. You might find out either from your
own internal reconnaissance or from readers like the one from
Youngstown, Ohio, who posted a note on the ``Polka Bats'' page
telling fellow book lovers that the reason the book was sold out
was because it had been featured on NPR.
</P>
<P>
   NPR is woefully underrepresented on the Web. I recently spent
two or three weeks searching on and off for a book I heard featured
on ``Weekend Edition.'' This was particularly rough since I could
remember only one word of the title.
</P>
<P>
   I finally found the book by searching through a long list of NPR
programs and trying to remember exactly which Saturday it was that
I heard the review. Clearly, there has to be a better way to
capture folks like Janet and myself, who are referred to in the
retail industry as ``motivated buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Major media organizations like CNN and even online-only
publications like Salon have deals with Barnes &AMP; Noble. Visitors to
each site are directed to Barnes &AMP; Noble to purchase books and
music featured on the sites. NPR has something of a relationship
with Borders online and offline bookstores to sell feature books
and CDs mentioned on its programs.
</P>
<P>
   But the list of books in Borders' ``Heard on NPR'' Web page is
painfully short, doesn't tell you much about the books and does not
include the beloved ``Polka Bats'' book.
</P>
<P>
   National Public Radio, home to such popular programs as ``All
Things Considered,'' ``Fresh Air,'' ``Car Talk'' and ``Prairie Home
Companion,'' boasts an upscale, literate and educated audience.
These are the same people analysts say are most likely to have
computer access and engage in online shopping. Pointing people to a
Web site where they can buy these books, CDs and other NPR-related
items seems like a no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of NPR's subject matter and its upscale,
computer-savvy audience is an e-commerce bonanza waiting to happen.
Borders.com, which seems to have some relationship with NPR, should
work to get more and more featured materials on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   For an online bookseller running a distant third to Amazon and
Barnes &AMP; Noble, Borders.com has a great opportunity to drive
traffic, build out its brand and establish itself as the
``do-gooder'' shopping site that supports the noble cause of
National Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
   This brings us to the subject of underwriting. Anyone who has
had their favorite NPR programs interrupted by the sounds of
ringing phones and pleas for pledges knows that NPR is
listener-supported radio. There is no advertising. So maybe instead
of interrupting my drive-time commute to ask for a donation, why
not encourage me to go to a Web site and buy something?
</P>
<P>
   All or part of the proceeds could go to NPR. If these sudden
sellouts of books and CDs mentioned on NPR say anything about NPR
listeners, it says this is an audience that uses the Internet to
buy books and music. NPR's television counterpart, the Public
Broadcasting Service, has its own online store at shop.pbs.org. All
proceeds from books and videos sold on the site go to support
public television. Why not shop.npr.org?
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is simple: Organizations that need money a lot
less than NPR are using online shopping to increase brand
awareness, drive traffic and make money. NPR listeners will spend
the time and the money online purchasing books, CDs and other
materials mentioned on its programs. If there's any organization
that needs to get deeply into electronic commerce, it's National
Public Radio. And if there's anybody who needs to be thinking about
funding NPR, it would be the online book and music retailers who
are, or could be, supported in part by NPR listeners.

 &HT;    TECHNOBUDDY: Use your computer to take a shortcut to shortwave
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There seems to be a Bulgarian in my PC.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he's sitting next to a German woman singing opera, who
is not far from a pompous-sounding British guy reading the news.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, I turned my PC into a shortwave radio. I did
not need the eye of a newt (newts across the nation should be
grateful for that), nor was it necessary to whisper the secret
words (you won't see them here; they wouldn't be secret anymore if
I told you).
</P>
<P>
   Instead, for $300 I added on a computerized shortwave radio. For
the money, you get a radio that performs just about as well as the
fancy $2,000 shortwave transceiver I use in my ham radio hobby. The
radio doesn't look like much _ it's small (about the size of a
brick) and doesn't have dials or knobs. That's where the computer
comes in.
</P>
<P>
   You hook up the radio to the computer (using a serial cable),
load in some software that comes with the radio and _ all of a
sudden _ you have a working shortwave. You use your mouse to tune
the radio, clicking on an on-screen control panel. That's part of
the reason you get so much radio for so little money _ the computer
does a lot of the work.
</P>
<P>
   The radio is made by a relatively small company called Ten-Tec
that's located in Sevierville, Tenn. (You can read about it on the
Web, or even order a radio, by going to www.tentec.com.) The fact
that the radio is made in the United States is a big deal, at least
to me. Shortwave radios _ like almost any other electronic gadget
you can name _ just aren't made here anymore for the most part.
Most of the big names _ Kenwood, Yaesu, Sony, Icom, among others _
are made in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   I was halfway afraid when the folks at Ten-Tec offered to send
me one of the radios to try. I like the idea of American-made
radios (and cars and steel and almost anything else you can name),
but if the radio had been really lousy I would have had to let you
know. But I didn't need to worry. Not only is the radio about the
size of a brick, it works and feels as sturdy as one.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the big deal about a shortwave radio that plugs into a
PC? After all, you can buy shortwave radios that don't plug into a
PC all day long. That's precisely the point ... you can buy them
all day long but, mostly, people don't buy shortwave radios. It's
seen as a hobby that is old-fashioned and sort of geeky, the very
same way that computers were seen when I started messing with them.
</P>
<P>
   But nowadays, computers are trendy and seen as a lot of fun. So
I am hoping that some of you find this great hobby of shortwave
listening through the back door. Maybe because the Ten-Tec radio
(it's called the RX-320 PC radio) works with a computer, some of
you will give it a try. Then, once you have it, maybe you'll pretty
much forget about the computer for a while and get lost _ in a good
way _ searching the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   The night I tried the radio, I listened to an American fighter
plane communicate with his controllers, two ham radio operators
talking about cornbread and bird dogs, a really intelligent
commentary on the troubles in Kosovo from the BBC (arguably the
best radio news service in the world), and some opera from Germany.
Compare that to what you can find on your local cable television
lineup at any given time of the evening and _ unless you actually
like programs designed for dull normal people _ you'll see why I
think shortwave radio is a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   I've spent a lot of time bragging on the Ten-Tec radio, and
everything I've said is true. But don't get hung up on that
particular radio if it is too pricey for you or if you'd rather
have a radio that you can take camping. You can find less-expensive
models from companies such as Grundig, Sony and Radio Shack, and
any of them can literally transport you to new places.

 &HT;    Gallaga: It's not the games kids play, but how
 &HT;    By Omar Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A few nights ago, I went to Blazer Laser Tag,
cashed a few dollars and began pumping quarters into an arcade
shooting game. The premise is surviving a haunted funhouse _ you
shoot monsters, ghosts and zombies with a shotgun that you hold in
your hands. When you run out of bullets, you reload by pumping the
barrel.
</P>
<P>
   I played for about 20 minutes, losing myself in a noisy, bloody
fantasy. I shot zombies' heads off, blew away flying insects and
tore through the flesh of relentless ghouls. When it was over, my
finger exhausted from firing several thousand rounds of imaginary
ammunition, I put the gun back _ not because the thrill was gone,
but because I'd run out of quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Despite my enthusiasm for game technology _ I'm quick to buy a
new graphics card or invest in more computer memory to play the
latest titles _ I've found myself for the first time ever agreeing
with parents and industry critics.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the games are too violent.
</P>
<P>
   A new University of Texas study, however, shows that while some
video games may make kids more aggressive, it may not be due to
their violent content.
</P>
<P>
   I've been thinking a lot of about video game violence lately,
not just as a reporter covering the criticism of the game industry
that followed the Columbine High School shootings, but as a
longtime gamer who grew up on Asteroids and Missile Command.
</P>
<P>
   I've watched with a mixture of horror and fascination as the
games I play have grown more extreme in their presentation _ as
graphics and sound have improved, the games have become more
involving experiences. The blocky graphics of one of the first
shoot-out games, The Castle of Dr. Wolfenstein, have given way to
the bloody, nightmare corridors of Requiem: Avenging Angel. In that
game, bloody, naked torsos jut out from the walls of an imaginary
hell, screams echoing through the computer's speakers.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair to the game industry, the research that's been done
so far suggests that games themselves are no more responsible for
Columbine than the Beatles were responsible for Charles Manson's
killings.
</P>
<P>
   And hard-core gamers are notoriously protective of their world,
a secret land of cheat codes, garish game magazines and fickle
tastes. Gamers will defend Quake and Duke Nuke 'Em, pointing out
that they've never killed anyone _ millions of other players
haven't gone on similar rampages.
</P>
<P>
   Video games, whether gamers like it or not, are part of today's
culture. Game magazines feature slick promos for how extreme and
twisted a game can be. Mortal Kombat's success had less to do with
great game play than its ``Can you top this?'' presentation of
fatalities. Death, in the world of many games, is not only
necessary _ it's cool.
</P>
<P>
   But here's a different idea: What if the level of violence in
video games doesn't matter at all in nurturing aggressiveness in
children?
</P>
<P>
   That's what a new study by a UT doctoral candidate suggests. A
dissertation by Michael Brooks with help from a colleague, Chuck
McVey, suggests that frustration _ how difficult a game is _
contributes more to a child player's aggressiveness than the
violent content in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know the effects of frequent video violence game play
over a long period of time, but in the short term, we found that
frustration was significantly correlated with negative emotions in
general,'' Brooks said. ``The kids who played and got frustrated
got irritable and upset.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, the study indicates, a particularly rough game of
Tetris might make your child more upset than blasting aliens with a
chain gun in Quake II.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks' study of 120 sixth- and seventh-grade students also
suggests that to kids, most video games are less realistic than TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``By saying video games themselves contribute significantly to
aggressive behavior oversimplifies a very complex phenomenon,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   More research is still being done _ UT's Center for Research on
the Influences of Television on Children will release the results
of a study on games later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Brooks and his counterparts at the UT center agree:
Parents need to be vigilant about what their kids are up to. That
goes beyond buying games based simply on ratings. That goes beyond
getting rid of the games that merely sound bad or look dangerous.
Understanding the games kids play is key to understanding what, if
any, effect violent video game have on kids. Parents should pick up
a game pad and find out for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Gamers are vigilant about defending their turf, but I've never
known one to refuse some multiplayer gaming with mom or dad.

 &HT;    Wonders of technology leave a user wondering
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A woman called last week to ask for help in solving what at
first seemed a simple problem, but when I finally understood it, it
could almost be called Catch-22 1/2, or ``You can't get there from
here.''
</P>
<P>
   All this nice person wants to do is get a new computer and
transfer her text files from her old one to her new one. Well, of
course, all of us seventh-level cognoscenti know there are many
ways to do that.
</P>
<P>
   You can do it, if all else fails, with floppy disks. You can do
it with Zip disks, which is what my caller would really like to do.
You can do it via modem. You can do it by simply hooking up the two
computers with a cable.
</P>
<P>
   But my caller can't do it in any of these ways. While she wasn't
looking, the technology race not only passed her but it lapped her.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't grasp the depth of the problem until a young man who is
trying to help her called me. She is running an 80286 computer
(that's a true antique). But that's only part of the problem and in
fact not the biggest part. The biggest part is that it's a really
early 80286 with 360K floppy drives (those are the big 5 1/4-inch
disks that you seldom see any more).
</P>
<P>
   So she can't transfer her files on floppies. Well, how about
transmitting them over the telephone?
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't have a modem, but I expect she'd be happy to buy
one. The problem is that I can't think of a single modem
manufacturer that puts its software on 360K disks any more.
</P>
<P>
   That's the rub. It's not merely a matter of not being able to
get files out. There's no feasible way that her helper or I could
think of to get software onto her computer. She's running an old
version of DOS, 3.2 I think.
</P>
<P>
   This is the worst case of technology lag I've encountered, and
the bitter part of it is that this person can't really be faulted
for not keeping up with the Gateses. All she wants to do with her
computer is write. She's not interested in computers per se; she's
interested only in what they can do for her in this particular
area.
</P>
<P>
   As many of us have already discovered, simple word processing is
possibly the easiest task there is for a computer. It doesn't
require any particular speed. Anyone, certainly, working with a
word processor will notice the difference between writing on an
80286 and writing on a Pentium II though.
</P>
<P>
   However, the difference is chiefly in how quickly the program
loads. Somewhere between the 80386 and the 80486, computers reached
a sort of equilibrium with word processing. Other than the speed of
loading, I can't see that Microsoft Word works one bit faster on my
400-MHz computer than it did on my 200-MHz machine.
</P>
<P>
   It was only when she began to think about storage issues and the
possibility of adding a Zip drive that my caller began to explore
the idea of upgrading her computer.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing I could ultimately suggest to her assistant was
to seek out a data recovery company, but that might be
prohibitively expensive.
</P>
<P>
   If there is anyone out there who has a solution, let me know
about it, and I'll put you in touch with this lady and her stranded
files.

 &HT;    CYBERSCENE: Meet someone new via personal Web pages
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tucked between the Web pages that sell you books, urge you to
download music, and extol the virtues of Fords and Chevrolets are
some pages that have nothing to sell. For the most part, the
designer of the page and the owner are the same person.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, these are personal Web pages. For the most part, what you
read and see on them won't help you with a term paper or provide
you with information you need at work, but it may introduce you to
some interesting people. Almost all personal Web pages have links _
usually at the bottom of the page _ that let you send e-mail to the
creator. It's a nifty way to meet people around the world (this is
the World Wide Web, remember) and, worst case, you'll probably
enjoy the old-fashioned nature of a home page. Many of them are
filled with family snapshots and stories.
</P>
<P>
   How do you find random home pages? After all, it's not like
doing a search for the gross national product of Brazil. But there
are ways, and today we'll show you some of the keys that will get
you into home pages from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a start that may keep you busy for a few days. Yahoo!
(www.yahoo.com) has a section that includes 64,000 or so personal
home pages. Just go to http://dir.yahoo.com/Society
</P>
<P>
   andCulture/People/Personal
</P>
<P>
   HomePages/ and start clicking. You'll find that this directory
is organized alphabetically. And that leads us to one of the really
entertaining things that today's adventure into the personal offers
us.
</P>
<P>
   Why not start the journey by looking up home pages by people
with your last name? Now for a person named Husted, that can be
especially entertaining. Most of the pages are in Denmark _ based
on the origin of the name _ so it offers a chance to learn about
that part of the family who stayed home. Admittedly, if you are a
Williams, Smith, Miller or Jones, the appeal may be less, but even
then you may find a distant relative in Des Moines. So click on a
letter of the alphabet and read the information that should include
the name of the page and a brief description of what it contains.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest repositories of personal home pages on the
Web is located at www
</P>
<P>
   .geocities.com. You can peruse the pages there by starting at
www.geocities.com/Avenues
</P>
<P>
   /PeopleandChat/. You'll find that the vast GeoCities site is
divided into neighborhoods. It's very similar to real-world
neighborhoods: Members select a neighborhood area for their home
page and build there.
</P>
<P>
   Since these are big neighborhoods _ true virtual cities _ you'll
need to use the search capability to find the sort of home pages
that interest you. For instance, let's say that you decide to visit
the College Park neighborhood at www.geocities
</P>
<P>
   .com/CollegePark/. Then you can use the search function (it's on
the left side of the page) to type in a search word. The name
``Husted'' brings up a list of sites that are either run by someone
named Husted, or that discuss that name. But you could just as
easily search for ``skiing'' or ``pets'' or ``games.''
</P>
<P>
   Most search engines, including AltaVista (altavista.digital.com)
have the same sort of search functions you'll find at Yahoo! or
GeoCities. But you are not limited to formal collections of
personal home pages. You can also use any search engine, type in
search words that include ``home'' and ``page'' and ``personal,''
and search out the most specialized pages easily.
</P>
<P>
   If, after spending a lazy afternoon searching other home pages,
you find that you like the charm of visiting with real people from
around the world, remember that it's fairly easy to build your own
home page and join the fun. And sites such as GeoCities offer free
space for home pages so _ if you get the building urge _ you can
soon have a home on the Web of your own.

   NETWATCHER _ Memo to National Public Radio: Want to raise money?
Think about online shopping. A few weeks ago, NPR ``Weekend
Edition'' anchor Scott Simon read aloud from a children's book
called ``Polka Bats and Octopus Slacks'' by Calef Brown. Many
listeners were charmed by the offbeat nonsense poems and logged on
to Amazon.com to order one or more copies of the book for the

access to the deep pockets of AT&AMP;T, suddenly takes on the phone
company to get Internet service customers. Microsoft, yes
Microsoft, a new player in communications, steps in with software
to push more entertainment and information through your video
cable. It's a sight to delight the eyes of Federal Judge Harold
Greene. He's the bold Washington jurist who put muscle in the plan

   HIFI11-COX _ Sound reproduction for popular enjoyment has come a
long way since World War II, especially for people who can remember
the 1940s along with 78 rpm records, record players and the tinny,
sometimes muddy, sounds that came from a single speaker. Today the
options are numerous, from the head-rattling bass systems youths
install in cars to ``Star Wars'' banks of speakers in family rooms.
And the choices of musical sources now include records, tapes,
video cable, videotapes, satellite and DVD, the latest technology

 &HT;    More than art that works, it's a mouse-terpiece!
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Pity, for a moment, the abuses suffered by your
garden-variety computer mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Manhandled and squeezed by uncaring palms. Forced to run laps
around the mouse pad or crawl with exacting precision on an Excel
spreadsheet. Retrieved with a pull of the tail when it is
accidentally shooed off the desk by a clumsy hand. Often forced to
live a bland white-beige existence.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Miller, a University of Texas graduate and former Power
Computing Corp. salesman, is doing something about the unjust life
of the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   He and his partner Reid Dickson founded Custom Mouse Co., a
small operation they run from Miller's apartment. There, they make
mice with personality _ custom-designed mechanisms with color, odd
shapes and designs.
</P>
<P>
   Custom Mouse Co. has its roots in Dickson's garage, where the
two first took apart broken mice and experimented with black
leather, and later, paints and silk-screen logos. But not just any
paints _ specialty painting and silk-screen companies that work
with Custom Mouse do a three-layer paint job on the mice that
yields what you'd find on a Lexus or a BMW.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a colorful collection of mice that look ready for
the race track.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and Dickson buy mice from a supplier, then take custom
orders from companies, hoping that instead of the usual coffee mug
or key chain, companies in today's computer age will give away mice
with their company logos as promotions.
</P>
<P>
   In bulk, the mice run about $36 a piece _ about three times the
cost of a typical bargain-basement mouse. Custom Mouse has only
worked with a few clients so far, including Falcon Imaging
Solutions, but Miller hopes the company will make a splash this
year at a trade expo for the promotion industry in August.
</P>
<P>
   Colorful mice may become a booming industry _ the popularity of
Apple Computer's iMac proved there's a market for more colorful
computer goods. Miller said the small variety of computer colors in
the PC world led to his partner's idea for the company. He claims
he hasn't heard of any other company doing similar work.

 &HT;    Surveying sound systems
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sound reproduction for popular enjoyment has come a long way
since World War II, especially for people who can remember the
1940s along with 78 rpm records, record players and the tinny,
sometimes muddy, sounds that came from a single speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Today the options are numerous, from the head-rattling bass
systems youths install in cars to ``Star Wars'' banks of speakers
in family rooms. And the choices of musical sources now include
records, tapes, video cable, videotapes, satellite and DVD, the
latest technology for sharp video and digital-quality music.
</P>
<P>
   It seems like only yesterday that the ideal for serious music
listeners was ``concert hall sound,'' or sound roughly equivalent
to what you might hear in an auditorium or theater.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, we hear things never heard in concert halls _
sound bombardment from all directions, straight from the movie
theater courtesy of George Lucas and his inventive colleagues. And
the sound sources that get amplified range from records to tapes to
cable to the last word in DVD, a digital brew of pictures and
startling audio.
</P>
<P>
   The simulation of movie theater sound, sometimes called surround
sound, has become practically the heart of the audio business these
days, with aural thrill seekers shelling out up to $10,000 and more
for powerful equipment.
</P>
<P>
   If you can bear the thought of not being on the frontier,
however, experts like Tim Hurd of HiFi Buys in Atlanta, say you can
get good sound for considerably less, perhaps in the neighborhood
of $1,000 _ assuming you are starting from ground zero. A key is
that advanced electronics now allow for entertaining sound
production from smaller packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are quality speakers in a compact system that would be
good for people getting their start in modern sound,'' Hurd said.
</P>
<P>
   Most people don't start from the beginning, however. Nearly all
music fans have at least a pair of quality speakers that are
capable of decent high- and mid-range sound reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   In launching my personal venture into surround sound, I was able
to start with a couple of DCM TimeWindow floor speakers that I've
had for nearly 20 years but still give good wide-range performance.
</P>
<P>
   The other components needed, in addition to the speakers,
include a well-engineered receiver such as a Kenwood Dolby Digital
model, available for about $400. A receiver is a combination tuner,
usually AM and FM, as well as an amplifier to drive the speakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolby Digital is a special kind of amplifier, produced by
various companies including Sony, Denon, Yamaha and others. What
makes it special is that it takes clear, accurate digital programs
from sources such as CD, certain tapes, cable or others, then
splits them into six distinct signals for the individual speakers
so the final combination of sounds envelopes the listener.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with video by way of tape or DVD, the sound can cause
the listener to ``hear'' a helicopter circling, or a twig crack
behind you, doing it so realistically that sometimes you can't help
but turn and look.
</P>
<P>
   It is a technology that can augment the action of certain movies
or give an aura of realism to programmatic music.
</P>
<P>
   DVDs or digital versatile (or ``video'' depending on who is
defining) discs provide pictures twice as clear as VHS tapes, with
CD-quality sound. This technology is so popular that stores have
trouble keeping up with demand, even at $300 and more per machine.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the sophisticated receiver, with the power to
assign sounds to individual speakers, the equipment package also
must include the right speakers. The ideal system consists of two
main speakers capable of good mid-tones and highly directional high
notes, as well as a front-center speaker to fill in and two rear
speakers also capable of a range of sounds.
</P>
<P>
   A package of speakers that fit into a system in the $1,000 range
could include Mirage AVS-200 speakers and a Mirage AVS-100 center
speaker, all designed to carry out special, complementary
assignments in the Dolby system. The small size of these speakers,
about 7 inches by 5 inches and 4 inches deep, makes them easy to
place around a modest-sized room.
</P>
<P>
   And a special feature of the modern sound system in the
surround-sound format is the sixth speaker, called a subwoofer,
that specializes in the bass or lowest sounds. While the other
speakers are powered by the receiver or main amplifier, the
subwoofer typically has its own amplifier and separate power
source. It picks up the bass signal from the receiver but draws its
power from its own electrical outlet.
</P>
<P>
   Since the bass signals consume high amounts of power, sometimes
as much as 80 percent of the power output of the receiver, the use
of a subwoofer contributes to better overall sound by relieving the
receiver of the power-consuming bass chore. Freed of that workload,
the receiver is able to devote its full power to the production of
quality mid-tones and high notes. In the sound system for $1,000,
the subwoofer has only an 8-inch speaker but also includes a
100-watt amplifier.
</P>
<P>
   Since the bass sound is nondirectional, subwoofers can be placed
virtually anywhere in the listening room. But the bigger the room,
the more bass response that is required.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way to augment this sound in a larger room is simply to
purchase a larger subwoofer,'' said Hurd of HiFi Buys.
</P>
<P>
   For listeners willing to forgo the surround sound, for a price
within the $1,000 or so range, the floor-standing speakers by
makers like Klipsch can produce very lifelike sounds that harken
back to the concert hall ideal favored by many fans of classical
music.
</P>
<P>
   Popular pairs of Klipsch speakers, with their distinctive horn
designs, are available from $650 to $1,500. Boston Acoustics,
Mirage and others produce their own floor speakers in roughly the
same price range, including some higher. Surround sound or not,
however, the only true test of personal satisfaction is to hear the
ensembles of speakers, so a visit to the dealer is highly
recommended. It's a very pleasurable assignment.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Fight for communications dollars is on
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T buys control of MediaOne, promises to provide competitive
local phone service. MediaOne, with access to the deep pockets of
AT&AMP;T, suddenly takes on the phone company to get Internet service
customers. Microsoft, yes Microsoft, a new player in
communications, steps in with software to push more entertainment
and information through your video cable.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sight to delight the eyes of federal Judge Harold Greene.
He's the bold Washington jurist who put muscle in the plan 15 years
ago to break up the monopoly of Ma Bell and usher in the era of
free-for-all competition in communications.
</P>
<P>
   What has happened since then, partly because of the new
atmosphere, has been the growth of wireless telephone
communication, lively rate competition in long-distance phone
service and the emergence of the Internet, the hottest advance in
communications history.
</P>
<P>
   But old Judge Greene, casting a sharp legal eye on this scene,
might very well see some reason for concern.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, AT&AMP;T, right before our eyes, is regaining much of
the shape and configuration that alarmed regulators and federal
trustbusters a generation ago. Moreover, we have the element of
Microsoft, already on trial on charges of being anticompetitive in
the way it uses its software dominance to squeeze out rivals.
</P>
<P>
   In a $5 billion deal with AT&AMP;T, Microsoft signed agreements that
may lead to AT&AMP;T adopting set-top boxes engineered by Microsoft,
blending Windows and WebTV technology to provide TV sets that also
act like computers.
</P>
<P>
   What Microsoft may hope to gain from its $5 billion investment
in AT&AMP;T is nothing less than a running start in the race to
dominate the cable box business. That would open a whole new
frontier for the company that already dominates computer operating
systems.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, as it has done for a long time, said last week it hopes to
use its telephone expertise and new cable properties to develop
one-stop communications services for consumers. These services
could include cable television, high-speed Internet connections and
an array of telephone services.
</P>
<P>
   With its power potentially to reach 60 percent of the national
market, more than any other single-stop provider of communications
services, AT&AMP;T raises a threat of industry domination once again,
in the eyes of consumer groups.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, AT&AMP;T argues that it can bring competition, for the
first time ever, in the local phone market and thus give consumers
a leg up on monthly communications costs.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the cable technology AT&AMP;T is hoping to provide may
put an end to the need to maintain separate phone lines for
conversations and for computers.
</P>
<P>
   Also, industry people concede that AT&AMP;T can provide the cable
business, for the first time, real expertise in telephone
technology, thus unifying the media for the benefit of all
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   However, some consumer advocates, like Mark Cooper of the
Consumer Federation of America, say the individual consumer could
lose in the huge bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Said Cooper:
</P>
<P>
   ``The costs (of the AT&AMP;T acquisition of MediaOne) are humongous
in terms of the anticompetitive effects on cable and broadband
services, and the benefits of local phone competition are
minuscule.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the AT&AMP;T words about competition are mere buzzwords will
be debated for some time among regulators, local and federal, in
the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, local phone companies like BellSouth will be fighting
the proposed merger on one front, and at the same time redoubling
efforts to upgrade their own systems to provide comprehensive
one-stop services of their own. That's a do-or-die mission for
them.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months both the local phone companies and AT&AMP;T
will be relying, to some degree, on their brand names to persuade
the public to look their way for a successful single retail
communications window.
</P>
<P>
   Each needs to be wary. It has been nearly a generation since
AT&AMP;T was truly Ma Bell, the trusted one-stop phone company. For
many young consumers AT&AMP;T may be just another phone company.
</P>
<P>
   Though BellSouth can take some pride in the local reputation for
reliability of its phone systems, the public must get used to the
idea of the phone company as provider of cablelike TV and Internet
service.
</P>
<P>
   We, as consumers, have a big task ahead in sorting through the
blizzard of ``nice deals'' that will be fired our way from a
platoon of bidders for our communications dollars.
</P>
<P>
   It will not be dull, this new millennium.

 &HT;    Palm V sticks with basic design, improves screen and software
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's expensive at $430, but the Palm V represents a big
improvement over earlier models of this hand-held computer.
</P>
<P>
   For Mac users, what's most important is that manufacturer 3Com
has finally got the PalmPilot's backup and synchronizing software
right for their platform.
</P>
<P>
   The company has successfully converted Apple Computer's old
Organizer software into a new release called MacPac 2.0. It's a
reliable and sophisticated personal information manager.
</P>
<P>
   But MacPac is no longer the only choice. Several other personal
information managers, such as Consultant and BrainForest, are also
offering versions for the Mac PalmPilot. That makes the PalmPilot
the only hand-held alternative for Mac users.
</P>
<P>
   Software is just the beginning of the improvements for Palm V.
There's nothing radically new about this latest model, which is
good news. The company has wisely decided to stick with the basic
design. What it has done is tweak the original design in important
new ways.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with the screen. One of the big problems with
earlier PalmPilots was that the screen was hard to see in dim or
direct light.
</P>
<P>
   With the Palm V, you can see the screen in almost any lighting.
Images are sharp and clear. There's a backlighting button included
with the Palm V, but you almost never need it.
</P>
<P>
   Another big change with the Palm V is that it doesn't use
batteries. Instead, you recharge it from a cradle that plugs into
the back of your Mac. It is from this cradle that you also back up
your calendar, to-do list, notes and contact list into the
Organizer software.
</P>
<P>
   One charge lasts days, if not weeks, depending on how often you
use the Palm V.
</P>
<P>
   But enough of these technical improvements. What really grabs
people about the Palm V is its looks. This PalmPilot sports a
wafer-thin, silvery body that fits snugly into any palm or pocket.
</P>
<P>
   In this design, 3Com has stolen a page from Steve Jobs' playbook
at Apple and discovered that style in designing computers is
important.

 &HT;    NETWATCHER: NPR missing boat on online shopping
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Memo to National Public Radio: Want to raise money? Think about
online shopping.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, NPR ``Weekend Edition'' anchor Scott Simon read
aloud from a children's book called ``Polka Bats and Octopus
Slacks'' by Calef Brown. Many listeners were charmed by the offbeat
nonsense poems and logged on to Amazon.com to order one or more
copies of the book for the little ones in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   But as it happened, Amazon underestimated just how many people
listen to NPR. There was a sudden flurry of requests for what was a
relatively obscure children's book. My friend Janet, who wanted
three copies, received a note from Amazon, sadly informing her
there was a ``surprise sellout.'' This is not an isolated case.
Another friend tried to order a CD featured on NPR, only to be told
of a similar ``sudden sellout.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprise? Oh please. Let's think about this for a minute, shall
we?
</P>
<P>
   It would seem to me that if you are Amazon.com and have
experienced several ``surprise sellouts,'' this might be something
you would want to look into. You might find out either from your
own internal reconnaissance or from readers like the one from
Youngstown, Ohio, who posted a note on the ``Polka Bats'' page
telling fellow book lovers that the reason the book was sold out
was because it had been featured on NPR.
</P>
<P>
   NPR is woefully underrepresented on the Web. I recently spent
two or three weeks searching on and off for a book I heard featured
on ``Weekend Edition.'' This was particularly rough since I could
remember only one word of the title.
</P>
<P>
   I finally found the book by searching through a long list of NPR
programs and trying to remember exactly which Saturday it was that
I heard the review. Clearly, there has to be a better way to
capture folks like Janet and myself, who are referred to in the
retail industry as ``motivated buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Major media organizations like CNN and even online-only
publications like Salon have deals with Barnes &AMP; Noble. Visitors to
each site are directed to Barnes &AMP; Noble to purchase books and
music featured on the sites. NPR has something of a relationship
with Borders online and offline bookstores to sell feature books
and CDs mentioned on its programs.
</P>
<P>
   But the list of books in Borders' ``Heard on NPR'' Web page is
painfully short, doesn't tell you much about the books and does not
include the beloved ``Polka Bats'' book.
</P>
<P>
   National Public Radio, home to such popular programs as ``All
Things Considered,'' ``Fresh Air,'' ``Car Talk'' and ``Prairie Home
Companion,'' boasts an upscale, literate and educated audience.
These are the same people analysts say are most likely to have
computer access and engage in online shopping. Pointing people to a
Web site where they can buy these books, CDs and other NPR-related
items seems like a no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of NPR's subject matter and its upscale,
computer-savvy audience is an e-commerce bonanza waiting to happen.
Borders.com, which seems to have some relationship with NPR, should
work to get more and more featured materials on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   For an online bookseller running a distant third to Amazon and
Barnes &AMP; Noble, Borders.com has a great opportunity to drive
traffic, build out its brand and establish itself as the
``do-gooder'' shopping site that supports the noble cause of
National Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
   This brings us to the subject of underwriting. Anyone who has
had their favorite NPR programs interrupted by the sounds of
ringing phones and pleas for pledges knows that NPR is
listener-supported radio. There is no advertising. So maybe instead
of interrupting my drive-time commute to ask for a donation, why
not encourage me to go to a Web site and buy something?
</P>
<P>
   All or part of the proceeds could go to NPR. If these sudden
sellouts of books and CDs mentioned on NPR say anything about NPR
listeners, it says this is an audience that uses the Internet to
buy books and music. NPR's television counterpart, the Public
Broadcasting Service, has its own online store at shop.pbs.org. All
proceeds from books and videos sold on the site go to support
public television. Why not shop.npr.org?
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is simple: Organizations that need money a lot
less than NPR are using online shopping to increase brand
awareness, drive traffic and make money. NPR listeners will spend
the time and the money online purchasing books, CDs and other
materials mentioned on its programs. If there's any organization
that needs to get deeply into electronic commerce, it's National
Public Radio. And if there's anybody who needs to be thinking about
funding NPR, it would be the online book and music retailers who
are, or could be, supported in part by NPR listeners.

 &HT;    TECHNOBUDDY: Use your computer to take a shortcut to shortwave
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There seems to be a Bulgarian in my PC.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he's sitting next to a German woman singing opera, who
is not far from a pompous-sounding British guy reading the news.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, I turned my PC into a shortwave radio. I did
not need the eye of a newt (newts across the nation should be
grateful for that), nor was it necessary to whisper the secret
words (you won't see them here; they wouldn't be secret anymore if
I told you).
</P>
<P>
   Instead, for $300 I added on a computerized shortwave radio. For
the money, you get a radio that performs just about as well as the
fancy $2,000 shortwave transceiver I use in my ham radio hobby. The
radio doesn't look like much _ it's small (about the size of a
brick) and doesn't have dials or knobs. That's where the computer
comes in.
</P>
<P>
   You hook up the radio to the computer (using a serial cable),
load in some software that comes with the radio and _ all of a
sudden _ you have a working shortwave. You use your mouse to tune
the radio, clicking on an on-screen control panel. That's part of
the reason you get so much radio for so little money _ the computer
does a lot of the work.
</P>
<P>
   The radio is made by a relatively small company called Ten-Tec
that's located in Sevierville, Tenn. (You can read about it on the
Web, or even order a radio, by going to www.tentec.com.) The fact
that the radio is made in the United States is a big deal, at least
to me. Shortwave radios _ like almost any other electronic gadget
you can name _ just aren't made here anymore for the most part.
Most of the big names _ Kenwood, Yaesu, Sony, Icom, among others _
are made in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   I was halfway afraid when the folks at Ten-Tec offered to send
me one of the radios to try. I like the idea of American-made
radios (and cars and steel and almost anything else you can name),
but if the radio had been really lousy I would have had to let you
know. But I didn't need to worry. Not only is the radio about the
size of a brick, it works and feels as sturdy as one.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the big deal about a shortwave radio that plugs into a
PC? After all, you can buy shortwave radios that don't plug into a
PC all day long. That's precisely the point ... you can buy them
all day long but, mostly, people don't buy shortwave radios. It's
seen as a hobby that is old-fashioned and sort of geeky, the very
same way that computers were seen when I started messing with them.
</P>
<P>
   But nowadays, computers are trendy and seen as a lot of fun. So
I am hoping that some of you find this great hobby of shortwave
listening through the back door. Maybe because the Ten-Tec radio
(it's called the RX-320 PC radio) works with a computer, some of
you will give it a try. Then, once you have it, maybe you'll pretty
much forget about the computer for a while and get lost _ in a good
way _ searching the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   The night I tried the radio, I listened to an American fighter
plane communicate with his controllers, two ham radio operators
talking about cornbread and bird dogs, a really intelligent
commentary on the troubles in Kosovo from the BBC (arguably the
best radio news service in the world), and some opera from Germany.
Compare that to what you can find on your local cable television
lineup at any given time of the evening and _ unless you actually
like programs designed for dull normal people _ you'll see why I
think shortwave radio is a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   I've spent a lot of time bragging on the Ten-Tec radio, and
everything I've said is true. But don't get hung up on that
particular radio if it is too pricey for you or if you'd rather
have a radio that you can take camping. You can find less-expensive
models from companies such as Grundig, Sony and Radio Shack, and
any of them can literally transport you to new places.

 &HT;    Gallaga: It's not the games kids play, but how
 &HT;    By Omar Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A few nights ago, I went to Blazer Laser Tag,
cashed a few dollars and began pumping quarters into an arcade
shooting game. The premise is surviving a haunted funhouse _ you
shoot monsters, ghosts and zombies with a shotgun that you hold in
your hands. When you run out of bullets, you reload by pumping the
barrel.
</P>
<P>
   I played for about 20 minutes, losing myself in a noisy, bloody
fantasy. I shot zombies' heads off, blew away flying insects and
tore through the flesh of relentless ghouls. When it was over, my
finger exhausted from firing several thousand rounds of imaginary
ammunition, I put the gun back _ not because the thrill was gone,
but because I'd run out of quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Despite my enthusiasm for game technology _ I'm quick to buy a
new graphics card or invest in more computer memory to play the
latest titles _ I've found myself for the first time ever agreeing
with parents and industry critics.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the games are too violent.
</P>
<P>
   A new University of Texas study, however, shows that while some
video games may make kids more aggressive, it may not be due to
their violent content.
</P>
<P>
   I've been thinking a lot of about video game violence lately,
not just as a reporter covering the criticism of the game industry
that followed the Columbine High School shootings, but as a
longtime gamer who grew up on Asteroids and Missile Command.
</P>
<P>
   I've watched with a mixture of horror and fascination as the
games I play have grown more extreme in their presentation _ as
graphics and sound have improved, the games have become more
involving experiences. The blocky graphics of one of the first
shoot-out games, The Castle of Dr. Wolfenstein, have given way to
the bloody, nightmare corridors of Requiem: Avenging Angel. In that
game, bloody, naked torsos jut out from the walls of an imaginary
hell, screams echoing through the computer's speakers.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair to the game industry, the research that's been done
so far suggests that games themselves are no more responsible for
Columbine than the Beatles were responsible for Charles Manson's
killings.
</P>
<P>
   And hard-core gamers are notoriously protective of their world,
a secret land of cheat codes, garish game magazines and fickle
tastes. Gamers will defend Quake and Duke Nuke 'Em, pointing out
that they've never killed anyone _ millions of other players
haven't gone on similar rampages.
</P>
<P>
   Video games, whether gamers like it or not, are part of today's
culture. Game magazines feature slick promos for how extreme and
twisted a game can be. Mortal Kombat's success had less to do with
great game play than its ``Can you top this?'' presentation of
fatalities. Death, in the world of many games, is not only
necessary _ it's cool.
</P>
<P>
   But here's a different idea: What if the level of violence in
video games doesn't matter at all in nurturing aggressiveness in
children?
</P>
<P>
   That's what a new study by a UT doctoral candidate suggests. A
dissertation by Michael Brooks with help from a colleague, Chuck
McVey, suggests that frustration _ how difficult a game is _
contributes more to a child player's aggressiveness than the
violent content in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know the effects of frequent video violence game play
over a long period of time, but in the short term, we found that
frustration was significantly correlated with negative emotions in
general,'' Brooks said. ``The kids who played and got frustrated
got irritable and upset.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, the study indicates, a particularly rough game of
Tetris might make your child more upset than blasting aliens with a
chain gun in Quake II.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks' study of 120 sixth- and seventh-grade students also
suggests that to kids, most video games are less realistic than TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``By saying video games themselves contribute significantly to
aggressive behavior oversimplifies a very complex phenomenon,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   More research is still being done _ UT's Center for Research on
the Influences of Television on Children will release the results
of a study on games later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Brooks and his counterparts at the UT center agree:
Parents need to be vigilant about what their kids are up to. That
goes beyond buying games based simply on ratings. That goes beyond
getting rid of the games that merely sound bad or look dangerous.
Understanding the games kids play is key to understanding what, if
any, effect violent video game have on kids. Parents should pick up
a game pad and find out for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Gamers are vigilant about defending their turf, but I've never
known one to refuse some multiplayer gaming with mom or dad.

 &HT;    Wonders of technology leave a user wondering
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A woman called last week to ask for help in solving what at
first seemed a simple problem, but when I finally understood it, it
could almost be called Catch-22 1/2, or ``You can't get there from
here.''
</P>
<P>
   All this nice person wants to do is get a new computer and
transfer her text files from her old one to her new one. Well, of
course, all of us seventh-level cognoscenti know there are many
ways to do that.
</P>
<P>
   You can do it, if all else fails, with floppy disks. You can do
it with Zip disks, which is what my caller would really like to do.
You can do it via modem. You can do it by simply hooking up the two
computers with a cable.
</P>
<P>
   But my caller can't do it in any of these ways. While she wasn't
looking, the technology race not only passed her but it lapped her.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't grasp the depth of the problem until a young man who is
trying to help her called me. She is running an 80286 computer
(that's a true antique). But that's only part of the problem and in
fact not the biggest part. The biggest part is that it's a really
early 80286 with 360K floppy drives (those are the big 5 1/4-inch
disks that you seldom see any more).
</P>
<P>
   So she can't transfer her files on floppies. Well, how about
transmitting them over the telephone?
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't have a modem, but I expect she'd be happy to buy
one. The problem is that I can't think of a single modem
manufacturer that puts its software on 360K disks any more.
</P>
<P>
   That's the rub. It's not merely a matter of not being able to
get files out. There's no feasible way that her helper or I could
think of to get software onto her computer. She's running an old
version of DOS, 3.2 I think.
</P>
<P>
   This is the worst case of technology lag I've encountered, and
the bitter part of it is that this person can't really be faulted
for not keeping up with the Gateses. All she wants to do with her
computer is write. She's not interested in computers per se; she's
interested only in what they can do for her in this particular
area.
</P>
<P>
   As many of us have already discovered, simple word processing is
possibly the easiest task there is for a computer. It doesn't
require any particular speed. Anyone, certainly, working with a
word processor will notice the difference between writing on an
80286 and writing on a Pentium II though.
</P>
<P>
   However, the difference is chiefly in how quickly the program
loads. Somewhere between the 80386 and the 80486, computers reached
a sort of equilibrium with word processing. Other than the speed of
loading, I can't see that Microsoft Word works one bit faster on my
400-MHz computer than it did on my 200-MHz machine.
</P>
<P>
   It was only when she began to think about storage issues and the
possibility of adding a Zip drive that my caller began to explore
the idea of upgrading her computer.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing I could ultimately suggest to her assistant was
to seek out a data recovery company, but that might be
prohibitively expensive.
</P>
<P>
   If there is anyone out there who has a solution, let me know
about it, and I'll put you in touch with this lady and her stranded
files.

 &HT;    Y2K COMMENTARY: Work and leisure intermingling
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With the school year winding down and the temperatures
warming up, millions of Americans are pulling out the travel
brochures to plan their summer vacation. In droves, we'll be
heading for beaches, mountains and amusement parks for a little
relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   But the simple act of relaxing is getting more complicated as
the lines blur between work and leisure. With cellular phones,
laptop computers and beepers bringing us updates from the office, a
vacation day at the beach has become less of, well, a day at the
beach. At the same time, leisure is creeping into our jobs, with
business conventions often turning into enjoyable outings and
baseball games serving as ``networking'' time with clients.
</P>
<P>
   With the distinctions between work and fun getting less clear,
sociologists, economists and other workplace observers are arguing
about the future of leisure. Some think Americans will work longer
hours in the next century, while others say we are entering a
golden age of relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   In general, this past century has brought us more fun and less
drudgery. In 1900, workers typically toiled 10 hours a day, six
days a week.
</P>
<P>
   Leisure took a leap forward in 1938 when Congress passed the
Fair Labor and Standards Act to set 40 hours as the legal workweek.
Two-week vacations became common in the post-World War II era.
</P>
<P>
   Today, slightly more than two-thirds of U.S. workers put in 40
hours or more on the job each week. In other words, for the great
majority of us, the workweek is no shorter than it was 60 years
ago. With all of the increases in productivity since then, why
haven't we gained more leisure time?
</P>
<P>
   Some economists say the workweek has not shrunk because most
Americans prefer to increase their buying power rather than expand
their relaxation time. Indeed, union leaders typically find that
workers would much rather fight for higher wages than demand
shorter hours. By sticking to a 40-hour week, we have pushed our
affluence to record heights, with home ownership rates at the
highest level in history and the average new home size growing to
twice what it was in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   But isn't it time to say enough already? The majority of us have
enough income for basics, such as food, clothing, shelter and
transportation; aren't we ready to spend more time enjoying life?
</P>
<P>
   Some sociologists argue that we already are doing just that,
even though it appears we are ``working'' long hours. For example,
we may still be sitting at our desks for 40 hours, but we are
spending much of that time making personal phone calls, playing
computer games and surfing the Internet. Web site operators say the
peak surfing time is between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. because so many
workers are entertaining themselves online.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of lunch-hour fun, more and more workers are
finding that the food in the cafeteria is _ dare we say it _ good.
Many employers are making sure their workers' breaks are filled
with Dove Bars and Starbucks coffee. Going to work in a suburban
office park can mean outdoor tables and an in-house gym.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, millions of Americans are not enjoying themselves as
they mine coal, clean toilets or pour asphalt. For them, work
remains nothing but work. But for the majority, the hours spent on
the job are getting more enjoyable because of changes that involve
air conditioning, computers and lunchroom microwave ovens.
</P>
<P>
   The issue in the new century may not be whether we will have
more leisure time or more work, but whether we will be able to tell
the difference.
</P>
<P>

Marilyn Geewax on issues raised by the coming of 2000.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: There's no place like home
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ We undertook a little exercise in futility a few
weeks ago. Befelled by temporary insanity, we suddenly believed it
would be a good idea _ although we have three sons to put through
college in the next decade _ to buy a new house.
</P>
<P>
   Many people look toward downsizing when children begin to leave
home. Not us. We were operating under the better-late-than-never
premise.
</P>
<P>
   So, we began the search. I pored over real estate listings,
shying away from the ones that didn't include a price. I
optimistically circled in red ink the 4br, 3ba, private master, 2
liv. area listings and tried not to gulp too loudly at the
six-figure prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never get what they ask for,'' I assured my husband,
casting myself as the real estate expert. ``We can probably offer
tons less than that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure we can,'' he replied, ``and they'll laugh hysterically.''
</P>
<P>
   Wet blanket.
</P>
<P>
   I began driving the long way home, looping through neighborhoods
on my ``wouldn't-it-be-nice'' list. When I scoped out a few
possibilities, I'd show them to my husband. He never saw the same
possibilities I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that a lovely back yard?'' I'd exude.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd take three days to mow it,'' came the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``But look at the gable windows on the second story,'' I'd
counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You gonna climb a ladder to wash them?''
</P>
<P>
   I went back to looking by myself.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, I fall in love with just about every house I
see. I step across the threshold and I'm imagining our sons' brides
walking down the staircase on their wedding days, picturing
grandchildren playing in front of the hearth, planning the
wallpaper I'll use in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   My husband steps across the threshold and notices the rotting
floorboard, the water stain on the ceiling, the lack of storm
windows, the slight crack in the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   We don't look for houses often because it really isn't a
pleasant way for us to spend time together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing,'' my husband intoned soberly one evening
during our search, ``is that we have no guarantee we could sell
this house.''
</P>
<P>
   We both cast an appraising eye about our domain. It does have a
nice, homey, lived-in feel about it: stained carpets, banged-up
interior doors, besmudged walls and the faint, lingering odor of
dirty shinguards and wet dogs.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, there's brand-new central heat and air. After
years of sweating through summers and freezing in winter, it's
wonderful. There's a newly shingled roof with a new skylight. We
have repainted almost every room in the house at least once. We
have replaced some of the carpets, if not all (who ever goes in
those back rooms anyway?).
</P>
<P>
   As my husband and I mentally assessed the pros and cons of our
house, we looked at each other with a dawning awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' I said, ``I could paint the laundry room and make
some new curtains. It would really brighten that room up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And we could buy a few more lamps for this room,'' he added.

   Faster than you can say ``amortization schedule,'' we decided to
put our house-hunting on hold. We still have a master bath the size
of a postage stamp and no shower in the front bathroom. We still
have a cracked back patio and more weeds than grass in the yard.
But it fits us well. Let's face it _ we're crabgrass kind of
people.
</P>
<P>
   A house is like a member of the family. You tend to overlook the
good points and too quickly fixate on the bad. At least you know
what the problems are and you're used to dealing with them.
Sometimes you don't realize what you have under your own roof until
you start looking under others.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, is that a new water stain?

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: 25 years of swipe and beep
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ The routine of my first job was as strange
and antique to my children as if I were a powder monkey,
blacksmith's apprentice or loblolly boy.
</P>
<P>
   I worked a cash register.
</P>
<P>
   It had big, round, chrome-edged mechanical keys. A bell that
jingled when the cash drawer flew open. I computed the change in my
head. A distant epoch, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   The device that changed this work was the bar-code scanner, an
invention that celebrates its 25th anniversary this month.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to remember the pre-bar-code world. It was a long time
ago in a supermarket far, far away. Back when the phrase ``paper or
plastic?'' didn't automatically mean grocery bags. An age when they
stamped prices right on the merchandise. When shoppers could look
at a clearly marked price that would never change between shelf and
checkout line. A time when a clerk could not silence a long line of
whining customers by shouting the simple phrase: ``the system's
down!'' An age without the things that make modern life so
convenient.
</P>
<P>
   Let history record that everything changed May 5, 1974. That's
when NCR rolled out the first bar-code scanner at a supermarket
industry trade show. The next month, June 26, at Marsh Supermarket
in Troy, Ohio, a 10-pack of Wrigley's Juicy Fruit gum was waved
over glass to become the first product scanned in a supermarket. I
wonder if there will be a costumed re-enactment.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1980s, the things were so commonplace that President Bush
looked bizarrely out of it when he gee-whizzed at the sight of this
newfangled contraption. Had this man never been on a fact-finding
tour of a Mini Mart?
</P>
<P>
   But any technological miracle comes with side-effects. This
one's no exception. Bar-code scanners helped move lines so fast
that clerks no longer needed to look up from their processing to
say ``hello.'' We went from chatting behind the counter to
repetitive stress injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The art of mentally calculating change also began dying out.
Scanners and computers figure the amounts and clerks merely shove
change at you without comment. They don't know if it's right. You
don't know if it's right. You both look numbly at the readout
screen and figure it knows best.
</P>
<P>
   All this makes for a more boring world on both sides of the
counter.
</P>
<P>
   Scanner jockeys are deprived of the simple tactile pleasures of
the old cash registers. Of feeling springs and gears resist your
fingers as you bring the keys down with both hands. Cashiers work
to a rhythm of a monotone beep. Sweep and beep as each code is
noted by laser beam. No friendly little jingle of a bell.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic cash boxes often have no place to tape kids'
pictures, sales-tax conversion charts written in ballpoint or a
scornfully displayed bad check.
</P>
<P>
   Scanners have helped dumb-down already tedious work.
</P>
<P>
   In our post-literate society, some fast-food chains have cash
registers with pictures on the buttons. That way the help doesn't
need the ability to read words or even numbers printed on keys.
</P>
<P>
   We work faster and dumber all the time.
</P>
<P>
   So much faster and dumber, that some supermarket chains are
experimenting with self-service scanners. That way I, the customer,
can experience the pleasure of telling myself that even though the
marked price is wrong and there's nothing I can do about it because
I just work here. I can crush the bread and break the eggs myself,
just like a pro.
</P>
<P>
   Moving from self-serve gasoline, to the ATM, to self-serve
grocery scanning, I'd hardly talk to anybody anymore. Except my
kids, and they're teen-agers, so a lot of what they say isn't
helpful.
</P>
<P>
   I see this as a bad thing. People live too much in their own
little cocoons. Everyone should once in a while have to speak with
a few people not of their choosing. If we don't, we forget that
everyone isn't just like us.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, bagging groceries is too much like work. And what will
those kids do for summer jobs if I take their job? They will go the
way of gas pumpers, newsboys and milkmen.
</P>
<P>
   By refusing to do things for myself, I like to think I'm
standing up for the humble bag boy. This is not laziness _ there's
a principle involved. If it doesn't stop here, what could the next
25 years of bar codes bring?

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The meaning of hats
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ The other day I'm reading a story about a
pushcart peddler to my eighth-graders. The setting is New York, and
in an effort to bring the Big Apple down to understandable size for
a group of youngsters growing up in a farm community of 2,000, I
ask if anyone has ever been to New York City. I'm thinking a
first-person, hometown association might make the barely believable
at least imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan raises his hand and tells us he'd ALMOST been there
once but his grandma had changed her mind and taken him to
Cleveland instead. ``Is that close enough?'' he wonders.
</P>
<P>
   When the story follows our character down into the subway, I ask
someone to describe how a subway works. Benjy volunteers. ``It's a
place where you buy sandwiches on long buns. There's one in
Woodville.'' As proof, he begins reciting the menu from memory.
</P>
<P>
   Ted insists a subway is a hole in the ground with buses in it
where people go to get mugged. They argue.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, I encourage a little controlled controversy in the
classroom as a stimulus to higher thought, but a heated discussion
over whether or not someone was selling salami sandwiches from a
bus in a hole in the ground is leading nowhere. I intervene and do
my best to describe a subway system, how one looks (but not how it
smells), and why such an operation is necessary in metropolitan
areas where everybody who lives north works south, and vice versa.
We move on.
</P>
<P>
   A few chapters later, the main character is dressing for church
and, in her haste, accidentally jabs herself with a hatpin. Angie
interrupts. ``What's a hatpin?'' I launch into a thumbnail sketch
of the design and function of a hatpin. From the sea of blank
expressions facing me, it's evident that my explanation needs to be
more basic _ starting with, What's a hat?
</P>
<P>
   ``This story we're reading,'' I begin, ``takes place in 1942.
People dressed differently back then and folks wore hats everywhere
_ to work, to church, shopping, even to the movies.'' A quip about
ladies with hats big enough to block out John Wayne AND his horse
is declared a dud. Quickly, the kids size up my lecture as little
more than another installment of grown-up baloney. Fearlessly, I
slog on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Picture a time,'' I suggest, ``when young men didn't have to
walk around holding up their pants with both hands because they'd
bought Hoss Cartwright-size britches to hang on their Mr.
Peepers-size bodies.'' That comment, of course, falls flat on its
antiquated backside. They've never heard of either character, and
as Roger reminds me, only dorks wear pants that don't leave half of
their butts and all of their dignity hanging out.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, it really matters to me that these kids understand
about hats. ``Hats did more than keep people's heads warm,'' I
begin again. ``They were used as a sign of respect. Gentlemen
always removed their hats in elevators, in deference to the ladies.
And when the American flag passed in a parade, men placed them over
their hearts in a display of patriotism.' No one is particularly
impressed, but Angie says she's seen her grandfather do that at the
Firemen's convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can anyone tell me why hats are not allowed in our school
building?'' I ask. Benjy says it's just another way of bossing kids
around. I correct him: ``Because it's considered bad manners to
wear hats indoors. It signifies a lack of respect for authority,
each other, and maybe even motherhood and apple pie.'' Not a
chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   At the risk of hopelessly outdating myself I explain that
baseball caps used to be worn only by kids who played baseball, and
any guy who wore one turned backwards was immediately branded a
rowdy who rode a bicycle with no fenders and smelled like an
ashtray. My audience finds this impossible to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   In a last-ditch effort to explain the importance of hats in
history, I relate the story of my mother's Easter hat _ the black
straw shaped like an old stovepipe. ``It was so silly looking that
it cracked up half the Sunday morning congregation AND Lillie Mae
Cosens, my mother's best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Ho hum.
</P>
<P>
   Give it up, I tell myself. Quit while you're behind. So much for
hatpins and respect, and back to the streets of New York.
</P>

 &HT;    Kids struggling with weight can fall into eating disorders
 &HT;    By Mary Beth Bishop
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can you imagine not eating anything all day long except for a
handful of gummy bears and an apple?
</P>
<P>
   That's the way Jordana Wolff, who's now 23, used to eat. Her
hips and breasts began developing sooner than her friends', making
her feel like she was much larger than they were.In fourth and
fifth grade, she started to diet. She continued to lose weight in
high school.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of feeling better as she grew thinner, her body was
worn out and malnourished. She had to take naps after school to
make it through the day. ``I had to give my body a rest. I couldn't
take it,'' she said. Once, at a sleepover when she was a teenager,
she blacked out in a kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't get back on a healthy diet until she was a college
student and went to a psychiatrist for help.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff is not alone in her struggle with food. At least 8 million
people in the United States suffer from serious eating disorders,
according to the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and
Associated Disorders (ANAD).
</P>
<P>
   Most of those people were teenagers when they first got sick.
Ten percent began having serious problems when they were 10 or
younger, the group says.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of girls look in the mirror and see themselves as fat when
they're not really overweight at all. When Wolff was hurting her
body so badly in high school, she only wore about a size 8. If
you're a girl in middle school and think you weigh too much,
remember that gaining weight in your hips, thighs and breasts is a
normal part of getting older.
</P>
<P>
   And what about guys? They don't go through the same kinds of
changes and don't get eating disorders as often as girls. But it
can happen to boys, and more of them are starting to acknowledge
the problem, says Dina Zeckhausen, a psychologist who specializes
in eating disorders.
</P>
<P>
   There are different types of eating disorders:
</P>
<P>
   Anorexia nervosa is when a person eats very little food and
becomes dangerously thin.
</P>
<P>
   Bulimia nervosa is when someone eats large amounts of food but
then vomits or takes pills to keep weight off.
</P>
<P>
   Binge eating is when a person overeats for a period of time but
then diets or doesn't eat at all.
</P>
<P>
   Skipping meals every day just until you drop some weight may
seem harmless, but that's how lots of kids get on the road to
serious eating disorders. Too much dieting can keep important parts
of your body _ like your heart and kidneys _ from working the way
they should. It can also keep your body from developing the way it
should.
</P>
<P>
   FOR MORE INFO
</P>
<P>
   If you or someone you know has an eating disorder, you can get
help from the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and
Associated Disorders at 847-831-3438.

<P>
   Refugee baby born in U.S.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need water or a microwave oven to create an instant
American _ you just need to be born in the United States. Last
week, a couple became the first Kosovar refugees to have a baby in
the States. The father said he was glad his 7-pound, 8-ounce boy is
a U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
   The couple fled their home in Kosovo and spent many weeks in a
crowded refugee camp in Macedonia. They were among the first
Kosovar refugees to arrive in the States.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor who delivered the baby said the mother had much nicer
conditions here to give birth than in the refugee camp.
</P>

<P>
   Tornadoes strike U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Many U.S. cities got lucky last week as storms passed through
without causing much damage. Tornadoes born from the same storm
systems killed more than 50 people and injured about 1,000 in
states across the West and South. More than 35 tornadoes were seen
in Oklahoma, four struck Kansas and one hit Texas.
</P>
<P>
   High winds, heavy rain and hail struck Atlanta on Thursday.
About 13,000 homes were left without power. Tornadoes form when
warm, moist air fills the lower atmosphere and the temperature of
the air above drops rapidly. For Georgia and surrounding states,
tornado season usually lasts from March until May.

   &UR; By IAN SPELLING &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Bring on the lightsabers.
</P>
<P>
   Ewan McGregor knows what he's getting into. As a star of the
year's most anticipated movie, he'll be the subject of fan frenzy.
He'll be a media magnet. He'll even be an action figure.
</P>
<P>
   Because, after all, he'll be Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi knight, in
``Star Wars: The Phantom Menace,'' the eagerly awaited prequel to
the most popular film of all time that's set to open on May 19.
</P>
<P>
   And, for that matter, in the next two films in the series. We
don't know what will happen in the long-awaited ``first trilogy,''
but we know that McGregor's character has to survive long enough to
reappear as Alec Guinness in the original ``Star Wars'' (1977).
</P>
<P>
   Which means that McGregor will be wielding Obi-Wan's lightsaber
well into the next millennium, which is fine with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of that is great,'' the actor says. ``I've never done
it before. Instead of doing it over eight weeks, it'll be over a
few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old, Scottish-born McGregor, best known for edgy
roles in quirky independent films such as ``Trainspotting'' (1996),
``The Pillow Book'' (1997), ``A Life Less Ordinary'' (1997) and
``Velvet Underground'' (1998), relished the opportunity of stepping
into the mythic role of Obi-Wan Kenobi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got really fond of Guinness by watching him in a lot of his
films,'' McGregor says during a conversation at a New York hotel.
``He's a great actor, and so lovely in the `Star Wars' movies. It's
a lovely character, gentle and kind of fatherly.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an almost religious way, Jedi knights are at one with
themselves,'' he says. ``They're completely centered people, and so
they never get flustered or in a flap about anything. The idea that
they can see into the future is fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   ``To follow Guinness and to play a character who is that
together was appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other Jedi knights and masters who appear in ``Phantom
Menace'' are the diminutive Yoda (Frank Oz), the tough-as-nails
Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) and the swashbuckling Qui-Gon Jinn
(Liam Neeson). But the real master, McGregor says, was
writer/director/kingpin George Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   ``George was great and so smart,'' he says. ``I suppose if
you've got 400 or 500 people running around after you, you can be
as calm or crazy as you like. But George was very calm _ he never
lost his temper.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of film is very hard to do,'' he adds. ``It's a huge
task. George had to watch us, but he also had to be aware of all
the other things that were going to happen, things that no one else
knew were going on.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the challenge of doing a film whose ending is already
known to literally millions of moviegoers _ most of its fans can
quote ``Star Wars'' almost in its entirety _ McGregor promises that
Lucas won't let them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to spend 20 years waiting to do a new `Star
Wars' without pulling the rabbit out of the hat,'' the actor says
sagely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phantom Menace'' was filmed on location in the Tunisian
desert and at Leavesden Studios in London, both used for the
original film as well. For McGregor, it was a complicated exercise
in suspension of disbelief, working with sets, props and even other
actors that would be added later through the magic of digital
animation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long shoot and very tiring,'' he says. ``I had to
deliver the lines and hope they do the backgrounds nicely. You are
a cog in the machine. I appreciate now that sci-fi movies are very
taxing, very difficult to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Since completing ``The Phantom Menace,'' McGregor has been
shooting more conventional films almost nonstop. He's due to open
soon in the films ``Rogue Trader,'' ``South from Hell's Kitchen,''
``Eye of the Beholder'' and ``Nora,'' a drama that casts him as
Irish novelist James Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   McGregor even found time to appear in a recent London staging of
the play ``Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against Eunuchs,''
directed by his uncle, Denis Lawson. ``Star Wars'' aficionados will
remember that Lawson played Wedge, the X-Wing Red Leader, in the
original trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a tiny part in all three,'' his nephew says, ``and I
think it's rather bemusing to him that he still gets mail from
people. Everyone asks if he'll have a cameo in the movies, but he
can't because Wedge wouldn't be born yet.''
</P>
<P>
   When not working, McGregor says, he's ``a regular bloke'' who
rides his motorcycle, parties hard and relaxes with his wife and
3-year-old daughter, Clara, at their home in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work in my films and then I go and have a life as well,'' he
says. ``You can make life as complicated as you want and, within
reason, you can make it as simple as you like. I've always just
gone about my business.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most regular blokes' business doesn't involve
battling the minions of evil and wielding The Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my own lightsaber,'' he concedes, ``and that's something
the boys will understand. It felt pretty goddamn good!
</P>
<P>
   ``I got home one day,'' he recalls, ``and my wife and some of
her friends were there. I said, `I acted with R2-D2 today,' and
they all went, `Who? What?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Oh, it's a boy thing. Sorry.'''  &QL;

<P>
   Bring on the lightsabers.
</P>
<P>
   Ewan McGregor knows what he's getting into. As a star of the
year's most anticipated movie, he'll be the subject of fan frenzy.
He'll be a media magnet. He'll even be an action figure.
</P>
<P>
   Because, after all, he'll be Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi knight, in
``Star Wars: The Phantom Menace,'' the eagerly awaited prequel to
the most popular film of all time that's set to open on May 19.
</P>
<P>
   And, for that matter, in the next two films in the series. We
don't know what will happen in the long-awaited ``first trilogy,''
but we know that McGregor's character has to survive long enough to
reappear as Alec Guinness in the original ``Star Wars'' (1977).
</P>
<P>
   Which means that McGregor will be wielding Obi-Wan's lightsaber
well into the next millennium, which is fine with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of that is great,'' the actor says. ``I've never done
it before. Instead of doing it over eight weeks, it'll be over a
few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old, Scottish-born McGregor, best known for edgy
roles in quirky independent films such as ``Trainspotting'' (1996),
``The Pillow Book'' (1997), ``A Life Less Ordinary'' (1997) and
``Velvet Underground'' (1998), relished the opportunity of stepping
into the mythic role of Obi-Wan Kenobi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got really fond of Guinness by watching him in a lot of his
films,'' McGregor says during a conversation at a New York hotel.
``He's a great actor, and so lovely in the `Star Wars' movies. It's
a lovely character, gentle and kind of fatherly.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an almost religious way, Jedi knights are at one with
themselves,'' he says. ``They're completely centered people, and so
they never get flustered or in a flap about anything. The idea that
they can see into the future is fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   ``To follow Guinness and to play a character who is that
together was appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other Jedi knights and masters who appear in ``Phantom
Menace'' are the diminutive Yoda (Frank Oz), the tough-as-nails
Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) and the swashbuckling Qui-Gon Jinn
(Liam Neeson). But the real master, McGregor says, was
writer/director/kingpin George Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   ``George was great and so smart,'' he says. ``I suppose if
you've got 400 or 500 people running around after you, you can be
as calm or crazy as you like. But George was very calm _ he never
lost his temper.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of film is very hard to do,'' he adds. ``It's a huge
task. George had to watch us, but he also had to be aware of all
the other things that were going to happen, things that no one else
knew were going on.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the challenge of doing a film whose ending is already
known to literally millions of moviegoers _ most of its fans can
quote ``Star Wars'' almost in its entirety _ McGregor promises that
Lucas won't let them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to spend 20 years waiting to do a new `Star
Wars' without pulling the rabbit out of the hat,'' the actor says
sagely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phantom Menace'' was filmed on location in the Tunisian
desert and at Leavesden Studios in London, both used for the
original film as well. For McGregor, it was a complicated exercise
in suspension of disbelief, working with sets, props and even other
actors that would be added later through the magic of digital
animation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long shoot and very tiring,'' he says. ``I had to
deliver the lines and hope they do the backgrounds nicely. You are
a cog in the machine. I appreciate now that sci-fi movies are very
taxing, very difficult to make.''
</P>
<P>

   Bring on the lightsabers.
</P>
<P>
   Ewan McGregor knows what he's getting into. As a star of the
year's most anticipated movie, he'll be the subject of fan frenzy.
He'll be a media magnet. He'll even be an action figure.
</P>
<P>
   Because, after all, he'll be Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi knight, in
``Star Wars: The Phantom Menace,'' the eagerly awaited prequel to
the most popular film of all time that's set to open on May 19.
</P>
<P>
   And, for that matter, in the next two films in the series. We
don't know what will happen in the long-awaited ``first trilogy,''
but we know that McGregor's character has to survive long enough to
reappear as Alec Guinness in the original ``Star Wars'' (1977).
</P>
<P>
   Which means that McGregor will be wielding Obi-Wan's lightsaber
well into the next millennium, which is fine with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of that is great,'' the actor says. ``I've never done
it before. Instead of doing it over eight weeks, it'll be over a
few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old, Scottish-born McGregor, best known for edgy
roles in quirky independent films such as ``Trainspotting'' (1996),
``The Pillow Book'' (1997), ``A Life Less Ordinary'' (1997) and
``Velvet Underground'' (1998), relished the opportunity of stepping
into the mythic role of Obi-Wan Kenobi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got really fond of Guinness by watching him in a lot of his
films,'' McGregor says during a conversation at a New York hotel.
``He's a great actor, and so lovely in the `Star Wars' movies. It's
a lovely character, gentle and kind of fatherly.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an almost religious way, Jedi knights are at one with
themselves,'' he says. ``They're completely centered people, and so
they never get flustered or in a flap about anything. The idea that
they can see into the future is fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   ``To follow Guinness and to play a character who is that
together was appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other Jedi knights and masters who appear in ``Phantom
Menace'' are the diminutive Yoda (Frank Oz), the tough-as-nails
Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) and the swashbuckling Qui-Gon Jinn
(Liam Neeson). But the real master, McGregor says, was
writer/director/kingpin George Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   ``George was great and so smart,'' he says. ``I suppose if
you've got 400 or 500 people running around after you, you can be
as calm or crazy as you like. But George was very calm _ he never
lost his temper.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of film is very hard to do,'' he adds. ``It's a huge
task. George had to watch us, but he also had to be aware of all
the other things that were going to happen, things that no one else
knew were going on.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the challenge of doing a film whose ending is already
known to literally millions of moviegoers _ most of its fans can
quote ``Star Wars'' almost in its entirety _ McGregor promises that
Lucas won't let them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to spend 20 years waiting to do a new `Star
Wars' without pulling the rabbit out of the hat,'' the actor says
sagely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phantom Menace'' was filmed on location in the Tunisian
desert and at Leavesden Studios in London, both used for the
original film as well. For McGregor, it was a complicated exercise
in suspension of disbelief, working with sets, props and even other
actors that would be added later through the magic of digital
animation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long shoot and very tiring,'' he says. ``I had to
deliver the lines and hope they do the backgrounds nicely. You are
a cog in the machine. I appreciate now that sci-fi movies are very
taxing, very difficult to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Since completing ``The Phantom Menace,'' McGregor has been
shooting more conventional films almost nonstop. He's due to open
soon in the films ``Rogue Trader,'' ``South from Hell's Kitchen,''
``Eye of the Beholder'' and ``Nora,'' a drama that casts him as
Irish novelist James Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   McGregor even found time to appear in a recent London staging of
the play ``Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against Eunuchs,''
directed by his uncle, Denis Lawson. ``Star Wars'' aficionados will
remember that Lawson played Wedge, the X-Wing Red Leader, in the
original trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a tiny part in all three,'' his nephew says, ``and I
think it's rather bemusing to him that he still gets mail from
people. Everyone asks if he'll have a cameo in the movies, but he
can't because Wedge wouldn't be born yet.''
</P>
<P>
   When not working, McGregor says, he's ``a regular bloke'' who
rides his motorcycle, parties hard and relaxes with his wife and
3-year-old daughter, Clara, at their home in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work in my films and then I go and have a life as well,'' he
says. ``You can make life as complicated as you want and, within
reason, you can make it as simple as you like. I've always just
gone about my business.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most regular blokes' business doesn't involve
battling the minions of evil and wielding The Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my own lightsaber,'' he concedes, ``and that's something
the boys will understand. It felt pretty goddamn good!
</P>
<P>
   ``I got home one day,'' he recalls, ``and my wife and some of
her friends were there. I said, `I acted with R2-D2 today,' and
they all went, `Who? What?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Oh, it's a boy thing. Sorry.'''  &QL;

SUTHERLAND RETURNS TO STAGE IN DIALOGUE-HEAVY `ENIGMA'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Donald Sutherland, the most compellingly
sphinxlike actor of his generation, is just the sort of offbeat,
intelligent presence that you might hope to cast in a play called
``Enigma Variations.''
</P>
<P>
   During his long, distinguished film career, this versatile
Canadian-born actor has created many memorable characters whose
guarded probity and low-key humor have lent them a mysterious,
sometimes creepy, charisma. You never quite know what malevolence
may be lurking behind Sutherland's sensitive, vaguely troubled
stares and cockeyed grins.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, some of that oddball ambivalence rubs off on
Eric-Emmanuel Schimtt's teasingly diverting, if not especially
suspenseful, psychological thriller, in which Sutherland portrays
an imperious, Nobel Prize-winning man of letters named Abel Znorko.
Center Theatre Group's production, which opened Wednesday at the
Mark Taper Forum, marks Sutherland's first stage outing in nearly
20 years, and both he and Jamey Sheridan generally acquit
themselves well playing characters whose motives are never wholly
credible.
</P>
<P>
   A recluse filled with overweening contempt for the ``vulgar''
outside world, Znorko has lived for years on a barren private
island in the Norwegian Sea. As the play begins, he recently has
published his 21st book, ``The Unconfessed Love,'' an
uncharacteristically romantic tome consisting of love letters
between a man and an unnamed woman written during a period of some
15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Is the book autobiography or fiction? A portrait of the artist
as lovesick adolescent, or an elaborate literary hoax?
</P>
<P>
   Those are among the questions that haunt Erik Larsen (Sheridan),
an unprepossessing, middle-age man, when he shows up at Znorko's
door for a scheduled interview, announcing himself as a local
journalist. At first Znorko claims ignorance of the appointment,
even firing a rifle at Larsen and accusing him of trespassing.
</P>
<P>
   But as Znorko relents, the play quickly settles into a
cat-and-mouse dynamic, with Larsen probing for personal insights
and Znorko fending off his interlocutor with patronizing smiles and
slashing wit. Not that Larsen is without verbal ammunition of his
own. ``I'm sure I'll have a better appreciation for how I feel
about your books after you're dead,'' he tells Znorko dryly.
</P>
<P>
   As it becomes obvious that at least one of these men has brought
a concealed agenda to this cerebral jousting match, the screws
tighten and the tables turn _ then turn again _ in a manner that's
a bit too reminiscent of ``Sleuth,'' Anthony Shaffer's '70s parlor
thriller. Without giving too much away, ``Enigma Variations''
pivots on Znorko's disclosures about a former lover he (improbably)
hasn't seen for many years, and two subsequent revelations. The
first you'll likely see coming 10 minutes in advance; the second,
better camouflaged, makes you replay ``Enigma Variations'' in your
mind, with more emotional payoffs than the first time around.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, whenever the dramatic action starts gaining
speed, it bumps up against Schmitt's increasingly ponderous
dialogue, which the actors and director Daniel Roussel perhaps take
too seriously for its own good. Granted, even brilliant minds may
turn mushy when blinded by love. But the stale metaphors and trite
sweet nothings that tumble from Znorko's lips would make ``The
Bridges of Madison County'' sound like ``The Song of Solomon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know the cruelty of a caress?'' Znorko asks Larsen, and
Sutherland delivers the question as if it were timeless. Later,
virtually quoting himself, Znorko says of his lover, ``We were not
able to forge our own two selves into one.'' This is Nobel Prize
material?
</P>
<P>
   What begins as a lighthearted actors' romp grows rhetorically
top-heavy and philosophically self-important, with multiple
allusions to Homer, J. Alfred Prufrock, and the set of beautiful,
riffing melodies composed by Sir Edward Elgar that give the play
its title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enigma Variations'' has been given a handsome production
centered around Ming Cho Lee's elegantly austere set of leaden
skies and a desolate ocean framed by Znorko's book-strewn house,
atmospherically enhanced by Robert Wierzel's lighting. Roussel's
direction pulls you along through the extended musings on whether
the platonic lovers we fabricate in our imaginations are more real
than the live ones we take to our beds. &UR;  &QL;

FUNNY STUFF GETS BIGGER, CLEARER IN HDTV PRODUCTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On a Burbank sound stage, a crew of actors and
support personnel work their way through the pratfalls of a
standard television sitcom. But on second glance, this sitcom shoot
isn't so standard after all.
</P>
<P>
   Over to one side, the highly stressed director is one of the
hottest young talents in the TV business, studying a four-way
monitor that for once can't tell him everything the cameras see.
</P>
<P>
   In a little jerry-rigged island of electronics at the back of
the sound stage, people crowd around some very expensive TVs,
watching the action unwind on a wide-screen set with an
extraordinary picture.
</P>
<P>
   After days of experimenting, the actors' makeup has been applied
with excruciating care. And the sets have become something to worry
about, because even little flaws have to be covered up.
</P>
<P>
   And the studio cameras being used to shoot all this, something's
different about those, too. Instead of the massive, studio-quality
behemoths commonly used on such shoots, these are tiny, weighing
all of 25 pounds, and bolted to rolling tripod mounts that seem
oddly out of proportion to the relatively tiny machinery they bear.
</P>
<P>
   It's those cameras that change everything. They're
high-definition digital cameras, being used recently to shoot a
spec sitcom called ``Sam 'n' Ella's.'' No one's bought the show
yet, but its producers think it won't take long to find willing
customers, on three continents.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as we decided to do it in high-definition, we were
approached by a couple of people (interested in buying the show),''
said producer Mark Baker. ``Europe and Japan are begging for
(high-definition) content. So we're trying to sell it
internationally, because that's where the markets are.''
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated one-tenth of 1 percent of American households
currently owning high-definition television sets, there aren't a
lot of U.S. viewers just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to design a show over who's going to view it first,''
said scriptwriter Scott Morgan. ``That's probably going to be the
Japanese and British, which is why the teleplay is heavy on
physical comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last Saturday, all TV stations in the nation's Top 10
markets finally were required to begin broadcasting a separate HD
signal (though most of the big stations around the country actually
started sometime around last Nov. 1's ``voluntary'' start-up
target).
</P>
<P>
   And only on Monday did a major network program, ``The Tonight
Show,'' begin regular high-definition broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the people behind ``Sam 'n' Ella's'' think they'll
find buyers here, too. As with Europe and Japan, stations will soon
enough be crying for high-definition content like what the company
is making. That said, the production wasn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   The show's producers were able to attract director Josh Baerwald
(cousin of musician David Baerwald), a protege of ``Cheers''
co-creator James Burrows.
</P>
<P>
   Baerwald is one of the hotter young TV directors of the moment
but was willing to work on a spec show because of the chance to
learn how to deal with HD, he said. There are definite differences
from the kind of television he was suckled on.
</P>
<P>
   With the much wider screen, Baerwald had to frame shots
differently, which was good, he said. The wide screen, with an
aspect ratio similar to movies in a theater, allows both the action
and its comedic reaction to play out in the same shot, in a natural
way, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think comedy is played in twos instead of singles,''
Baerwald said. ``The high-definition screen is giving much more of
a range of line of sight.''
</P>
<P>
   But he struggled with a four-way monitor _ designed to show what
all running cameras are seeing simultaneously during a scene _ that
wasn't high-definition itself.
</P>
<P>
   Baerwald couldn't see the entire frame of each shot, requiring
constant consultations with director of photography Tom Feldman
about what worked and what didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of tough issues for producers,'' said Feldman.
``The level of perfection is way higher than on regular NTSC
(standard television) shoots.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because the cameras' extremely high resolution meant
Baerwald and Feldman had to keep an eagle eye on screen details
they normally wouldn't much worry about in the run-and-gun world of
television comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see so much on HDTV,'' Baerwald said. ``We're shooting
through a net (over the camera lens). Without the net, at 20 feet
the camera can see the pores in an actress's face.'' &QL;

TRAIL LEADS TO PARADISE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA, Calif. _ A beam of sunlight bore a hole through the
redwood canopy and poured across 60-foot Silver Falls, the light
refracting in the water crystals like miniature prisms.
</P>
<P>
   Deep in the Santa Cruz Mountains behind us was Berry Creek
Falls, a 70-foot free-fall framed perfectly in a redwood canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Up ahead was Golden Falls, a long, meandering series of cascades
that looks like a water slide as clear water passes over gold
sandstone.
</P>
<P>
   And here among the three crown jewels of waterfalls was Silver
Falls, where the trail passes so close to its brink you can reach
out and dip your fingers in the water as it passes.
</P>
<P>
   These gems unfold on the Skyline-to-Sea Trail, the No. 1 hiking
and camping trip in the San Francisco Bay area and the best place
to enjoy the coronation of spring.
</P>
<P>
   The hike starts on the Skyline Ridge above Saratoga, with the
trail head at an elevation of 3,000 feet, then is routed west over
China Grade, down through Big Basin Redwoods State Park and all the
way to the ocean at the Rancho del Oso Nature and History Center.
The hike covers 34 miles, including a 2-mile up-and-down to see the
waterfalls, and is downhill for most of the route, making it the
easiest three-day backpack in California.
</P>
<P>
   There are panoramic views, giant old-growth redwoods, pristine
streams in remote canyons, gorgeous wildflower blooms, honey-combed
sandstone rock formations _ with clean and sheltered campsites to
spend each night.
</P>
<P>
   The mass of civilization is just 15 miles from the trail head,
but it doesn't take long to feel as if you have launched into a
different orbit from the rest of mankind.
</P>
<P>
   My comrades for the trip were Rambob Stienstra, my brother and
wilderness explorer, and Michael Furniss, one of the preeminent
soil scientists in the nation. We have joined together for many
expeditions, including the John Muir Trail, much of the Pacific
Crest Trail, hunting for Bigfoot and mountain climbing.
</P>
<P>
   We left a shuttle car at the end of the trail, making it a
one-way hike. We planned for three days on the trail, with hiking
days of 9.6 miles, 9.5 miles and 15 miles, and two trail camps on
the way.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-morning, we were at the trail head at Castle Rock State
Park, just south of the junction of Highway 9 and Highway 35 on
Skyline Ridge. We hoisted up our packs, tightened the belts, joined
in a high five and a shout: ``Down!''
</P>
<P>
   Down? It seems every trip we've ever made goes up. In fact, 99
of 100 hikes in California go up, but the Skyline-to-Sea is the
exception.
</P>
<P>
   And down it goes, from the first few steps. Within minutes, you
drop down into a lush riparian woodland, a canyon filled with bay
and towering black oaks and live oaks, many coated with moss.
</P>
<P>
   After so much rain this winter, there is a green freshness to
everything. The headwaters of Kings Creek form at the canyon
bottom, at first a trickle of droplets, but soon a pretty brook.
</P>
<P>
   In little over a half-mile, the surprises start. That brook
drops over the side of a cliff, creating the first waterfall of the
trip. It is a broken free fall, the water hitting a crag about
halfway down. An observation deck seems to jut out over open space,
set just above and to the side of the waterfall rim.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of the crashing water is as refreshing as a shower.
</P>
<P>
   ``It already seems like we're a million miles away from all the
people,'' Furniss said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ocean seems a million miles away, too,'' Rambob said.
</P>
<P>
   The trail then cuts a lateral route across an open rock facing.
On clear days, the reward is a series of sweeping views to the
southwest, across a sea of conifers to Big Basin, the Pacific Coast
and Monterey Bay. On foggy days, the layer of stratus looks like a
pearl sea, with mountain tops poking through like tiny islands. On
rainy days, mist rises from the tree tops.
</P>
<P>
   But Castle Rock State Park is best known for its sandstone rock
formations. Many of these massive rocks are honeycombed like Swiss
cheese, a unique process where soft material has been eroded away
over eons. The most dramatic are Castle Rock itself and Goat Rock,
a popular rock-climbing site for technical climbers.
</P>
<P>
   The trail passes the base of Goat Rock, where a permanent
climbing cable has been affixed; for day hikers, the top of Goat
Rock with its lookout of Monterey Bay makes an idyllic picnic site.
There was not another soul on the trail. We had this world to
ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   From here, the trail goes down past the Castle Rock Trail Camp
(2.8 miles in), through Loughry Woods, then down past Travertine
Springs and the headwaters of the San Lorenzo River.
</P>
<P>
   The forest is second-growth here but has filled in well after
being cut 100 years ago, with a lush understory.
</P>
<P>
   On many hikes there is a sameness for miles, but Skyline-to-Sea
changes with every curve and ravine. The trail is cut so it is
routed in and out of canyons, around shoulders and ridges, heading
down to Waterman Gap Trail Camp (9.6 miles in).
</P>
<P>
   Every 10 minutes you get something different, from oak woodlands
to conifer forests, from cool, deep canyons with streams to hot,
open faces with long-distance views.
</P>
<P>
   Waterman Gap is the first-night destination for most hikers.
</P>
<P>
   We settled in, setting up bivvies and tents, cooking on a
backpack stove, marveling at the day's surprises.
</P>
<P>
   That night, I slept about seven hours. Only problem was it came
in about 20 installments. That can happen on the first camp-out of
the year. By summer camp-outs, I'll be sleeping better than on a
bed.
</P>
<P>
   After camp breakfast, soup and oatmeal, we set out on the second
leg of our hike, a 9.5-mile tromp to Big Basin Redwoods State Park.
</P>
<P>
   The trail leaves the oak woodlands and enters second-growth
redwood forest, and _ for the first time since the trail head _
heads up in a gentle incline to China Grade. It felt good to get
into a rhythmic climb, but it was over after 15 or 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly it seemed the entire world was at our feet. China Grade
is the rim of Big Basin, and below were miles of tree tops, many of
them giant redwoods, 300 to 2,000 years old. Looking west, we could
see Waddell Creek Canyon, and beyond, the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   We instinctively gathered in a circle for another high five, and
shouted ``Down!''
</P>
<P>
   And down we went again, grinning all the way. Within minutes, we
were crossing a series of huge sandstone plates that looked like
glacial-carved granite in Yosemite. Except this rock isn't slippery
like granite, and in many spots is like walking on sandpaper.
</P>
<P>
   Every step came with a view as we crossed through oak and
manzanita, the trail's edge sprinkled with wildflowers. After
topping a narrow ridge, the trail is routed down steeply into the
redwoods, and it seemed again we had discovered a world few enter.
</P>
<P>
   The route passes in and out of ravines filled with redwoods and
an understory of sorrel, bracken ferns and blooming trillium, with
creeks and streams flowing clear and pristine. The dirt trail was
sprinkled with brown redwood needles, soft and forgiving to feet
only now beginning to toughen up to trail life.
</P>
<P>
   The air was cool, and along shaded creeks we often stopped just
to watch the water go by.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while out in the woods, you understand that the
landscape is alive, and the streams are its blood,'' said Furniss,
a scientist who specializes in the protection of small streams.
</P>
<P>
   As we neared headquarters along Opal Creek, the redwoods started
getting bigger _ some 300 feet tall, and 40 to 50 feet around.
</P>
<P>
   We camped among the big trees that night and, after dinner, as
the temperature dropped to the 30s, built a campfire. The
flickering orange glow cast shadows off the trunks and limbs of the
giant trees, and we wondered about all that had passed here over
the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   As I drifted off to sleep, I thought of William Waddell, the
logger who cut down some of the biggest redwoods here in the 1800s,
and how he was killed by a grizzly bear near the creek that is now
named for him. The grizzlies have been gone for most of this
century, but the big trees remain. The proximity of such an awesome
old-growth grove to San Francisco inspired Big Basin's creation as
the first state park in California.

</P>
<P>
   The next day was warm, and by mid-morning the first blooms of
spring were opening to the sun _ wild iris, trillium, miner's
lettuce and morning glorys.
</P>
<P>
   From the forest floor near park headquarters, the trail rises
for 20 minutes, a steady grade, and tops the Big Basin Rim at 1,200
feet. The trail then descends 600 feet, over 4 miles, to the
waterfalls.
</P>
<P>
   You round a bend and suddenly glimpse filtered silver through
tree limbs. You head on and there it is: Berry Creek Falls. There
are two perfect viewing areas, one where the entire canyon is
framed, the other an observation deck at the base of the falls.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 20 waterfalls in the Bay region, this is the classic, a
70-foot free fall, with moss oozing water at its edges, surrounded
by redwoods, sword ferns and sorrel. The air tastes sweet and
fresh, full of life.
</P>
<P>
   Hiking upstream, you come upon Silver Falls, and then just
above, Golden Falls. You can spend hours here, having a picnic,
taking pictures, tromping up and down the canyon, absorbing the
energy.
</P>
<P>
   As the sun passed overhead, the light changed, and with it the
character of the waterfalls seemed to change as well. It was like
watching the face of a person you care about _ in the shade, cold
and pensive; in refracted sun, wondrous and mysterious; in direct
light, effervescent and electrifying.
</P>
<P>
   From the falls, it's an easy jaunt to trail's end, hiking along
Waddell Creek. We found 20 species of wildflowers, including the
most extensive blooms of Forget-Me-Nots I've ever seen.

ARTS PATRONS, ORGANIZATIONS CREATING OWN GRANT PROGRAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARIA RECIO 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The arts community, stung by cutbacks in federal
arts programs and the virtual elimination of grants to individual
artists, is stepping into the breach with a grants program of its
own.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, a group of arts patrons and 22 arts organizations are
to announce the formation of the Creative Capital Foundation,
organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement is scheduled for a cocktail party Tuesday
evening in the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts near the
SoHo section of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The new nonprofit organization, initially financed with $5
million, plans to distribute $1 million a year to 50-60 artists in
the performing and visual arts. And, unlike grants from the
National Endowment for the Arts, grants by the new foundation to
controversial artists should pose no problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a gap in the funding of artists wanting to do new
forms of art and who weren't going to be picked up by the
entertainment community or the mainstream art world,'' said
Archibald Gillies, board chairman of the new foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll look at art that's interesting, innovative, even
experimental and that challenges convention,'' said Gillies, who is
also president of the Andy Warhol foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Among the patrons of the Creative Capital Foundation is
filmmaker Richard Linklater of Austin, who will serve as a board
member.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its time has definitely come,'' he said. ``It's not a lot of
money, but for artists a lot of time that's the first validation.''
</P>
<P>
   Linklater received a $2,600 grant from the NEA for one of his
first films, ``Slacker,'' a 1991 cult hit about the zany aspects of
Austin. He went on to make more films and create a nonprofit fund
for Texas filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The move to form the Creative Capital Foundation, and its focus
on controversial projects, was sparked by opposition to the NEA
from conservative members of Congress, particularly House Majority
Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Armey, offended that controversial artists such as Robert
Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano had benefited from NEA funding,
engineered a 40 percent cut in the agency's funding and termination
of most individual grants in the agency's budget for fiscal 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Told of the plans to create private-sector funding through the
new foundation, Armey press secretary Michele Davis said: ``This is
what we've been saying all along. Government has no business
deciding what is and what is not art.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives have consistently maintained that the private
sector should pay for the arts. Some NEA supporters worry that the
new foundation could be used against the agency just as it is
rebuilding its support in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   NEA chairman William J. Ivey, who has held the job less than a
year, is asking Congress for a big increase in his budget _ from
$98 million in the current budget to $150 million for fiscal 2000,
which begins Oct. 1. He is also talking about reinstituting grants
to individual artists _ a program that distributed about $10
million a year at its peak _ in several years.
</P>
<P>
   Ivey said he welcomes the new foundation but does not think it
will impede his quest for more federal dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything the NEA does is part of arts funding in the U.S.,''
Ivey said. ``Never are we the entire support system. The private
sector needs to play a role, but the NEA provides a sense of public
investment, permanence and continuity that only a federal agency
can bring to arts funding.''
</P>
<P>
   Art gallery owner Ronald Feldman, who is on the board of the new
foundation, said: ``Even with NEA funds going to individual
artists, this would still be needed. It is in no way intended to
replace the NEA.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, federal dollars have also brought controversy.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, the NEA funded a touring exhibition of the
work of photographer Mapplethorpe, which included homoerotic
photographs, and another exhibition that included a Serrano
photograph that showed a crucifix in a vial of the artist's urine.
</P>
<P>
   And would Mapplethorpe and Serrano receive funding from the
Creative Capital Foundation?
</P>
<P>
   ``Would we shy away from that work? No,'' said Ruby Lerner,
executive director of the new foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner acknowledged that ``there is no question that the NEA
shutting down support for most artists was the framework for the
new foundation.'' She added that the foundation plans a new
approach to arts funding to generate continued support for artists.
</P>
<P>
   The new foundation will get an agreed-upon percentage of each
artist's work once the project starts to generate revenue. The idea
behind the ``revolving fund'' is to return money to the foundation
for the next batch of artists.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's offices will be in the same building as the
Andy Warhol foundation, and Feldman, who represented Warhol, thinks
it appropriate that the new foundation will be linked with the
avant-garde.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have loved it,'' Feldman said, referring to Warhol,
who died in 1987.

   SCATTER: The Housing Authority of Kansas City will build nearly
300 scattered site units throughout the city in the next 18 months.
In doing so, the authority is following a national trend of moving
from concentrated projects to duplexes and other small
developments. The move has generated concerns among neighorhood
leaders on both sides of the river. They see the developments
lowering home prices and hurting neighborhoods. But today's
scattered site housing is not your cement block project of the post
World War II era. We visited one woman who lives in a new Northland
duplex with a two-car garage. She says her home has given her

   WOMEN: When Park College awards its first three master's degrees
in business administration next weekend, it will be to three women.
At many college commencement ceremonies across the country this
year, women will outnumber men, a trend that has strengthened
during the 1990s. Men's share of bachelor's degrees declined from
81 percent in 1900 to just 45 percent today. In Missouri and
Kansas, those percentages are slightly lower. Some people celebrate
women's success at earning college degrees as revenge for years of
exclusion from higher education. But others bemoan the trend,
saying men are losing out in a changing world that often requires a
college diploma for good careers. Lynn Franey. 45. Photos and

STATE, NAVY SPAR OVER ROUTE OF NEW BAY BRIDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ State transportation officials knew three
years ago there would be problems getting permission from the U.S.
Navy to build a new San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, but it forged
ahead anyway and eventually spent $40 million for planning.
</P>
<P>
   Now a deadlock between the California Department of
Transportation and the Navy is the only thing holding up the $1.5
billion bridge, which is being financed by a 1998 toll increase of
$1 on all spans in the San Francisco Bay area, except for the
Golden Gate Bridge. The new bridge would be one of the largest
building projects in Caltrans' history.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute centers on where Caltrans wants to position the new
span between Oakland and Yerba Buena Island.
</P>
<P>
   State engineers and a regional commission want to build to the
north of the current bridge. But Mayor Willie Brown and the Navy
say the span should be built to the south, to protect potential
development and historic buildings on Treasure Island that adjoins
Yerba Buena.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge, which was built in 1936 and has a main span that is
2,310 feet long, joins the east and west sides of the Bay. The two
links connecting Alameda County to the east and San Francisco to
the west meet at Yerba Buena.
</P>
<P>
   Caltrans has tremendous power to take land it needs for building
freeways and bridges, but it has no control over the Navy. Caltrans
is up against another behemoth it can't control.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression is that they don't hear the word `no' very
often,'' said Jeff Young, a spokesman for the Navy, ``and I think
they kind of just proceeded. And now they've run into federal
property.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Caltrans hasn't worked with the Navy about getting
a drilling permit and putting heavy construction equipment on
Treasure and Yerba Buena islands. Caltrans has put together a file
with 74 letters and memos between the two agencies dating to July
6, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997, when it became clear Caltrans wanted to build a
new bridge instead of retrofitting the old one, environmental
officials for the transportation department sent a letter
requesting access to Navy property.
</P>
<P>
   Six days later, on March 10, 1997, the Navy replied with a
detailed letter saying the request was premature.
</P>
<P>
   The service said it appeared the plans would put Navy housing in
jeopardy, make too much noise and bother movie sound studios on
Treasure Island, and make it generally difficult for people to live
and work on the island.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Navy said Caltrans was ignoring its pleas to
improve dangerous ramps to and from the island that were built in
the 1930s, and Caltrans hadn't resolved who would clean up lead
contamination under the Bay Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the Navy desires to facilitate the seismic improvements
to this vital Bay area transportation artery,'' Navy manager Kenn
Y. Parsons wrote, ``we also feel that we need to understand the
environmental and economic impacts. ... As now structured, there
are too many unknowns and issues still undecided.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy contends the transportation department spent the next
three years meeting, writing memos and sending letters, but never
really fixing any of its concerns and always feeling it had a right
to the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think the level of communication would be greater
than that, given that a state agency does not have the power of
eminent domain over federal property,'' Young said. ``We're not
asking anyone to come to us with hat in hand. We're just saying the
communication could be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Caltrans now claims that if the Navy gets its way on a more
southern route for the bridge, the $40 million the state spent on
planning the northern route will have gone to waste.
</P>
<P>
   But the Navy says Caltrans knew that money was at risk,
especially since it failed to get formal permission to drill on
Treasure Island before it went ahead with its plans.
</P>
<P>
   Caltrans blames the Navy entirely for the delay, saying it sent
maps of where it needed to work and held numerous phone conferences
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   According to a memorandum from a July 1997 phone conversation, a
Caltrans official told the Navy it ``will not destroy historic
property on'' Yerba Buena Island, although the northern route could
``possibly go over or come close to the Nimitz House.''
</P>
<P>
   Caltrans officials also told Navy officials the new ramps the
service wanted were not part of the plan. Caltrans had no answers
about construction noise levels, except to say that pile drivers
would be needed. It told the Navy it would pay fair market value
for the use of Navy land.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is, they've known for three years that
a replacement bridge was an option,'' Caltrans spokesman Jim Drago
said, ``and they knew that if there was a northern alignment that
it would affect their property. And they, to this date, have not
allowed us to go in there and do the necessary drilling.''

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the east side of the San Francisco Bay, Alameda County
Supervisor Mary King supports the current plan and thinks Brown is
using the Navy to protect development interests on the island.
</P>
<P>
   She said the Navy, like Caltrans, should think more about the
safety of bridge commuters than the shrubbery and historic
buildings it owns on the island.

<TEXT>
<P>
   So far, the West's war against Serbia has been a shambles.
</P>
<P>
   The humanitarian catastrophe it was designed to avert has merely
been intensified.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a million people, over half of Kosovo's population, have
been driven from their homes; thousands are missing, perhaps dead.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's military machine looks defiantly intact: barely a score
of its 1,300-odd tanks have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Dazzled by technology and obsessed with avoiding casualties of
their own, the allies seem unable even to hurt, let alone destroy,
Serbia's army.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the list of accidents _ innocents bombed, aircraft
lost _ grows longer, and Slobodan Milosevic sits tight, waiting for
cracks to open in the western alliance.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the alliance is holding together _ just. If that is to
continue, the allies must start to speak with a single, consistent
voice about their aims, taking a clear view about what is bound to
be a long involvement, and thinking through the consequences of the
choices that lie before them.
</P>
<P>
   The five initial aims were explicit. They were that the refugees
should be able to return safely home; that all Serb forces should
withdraw from Kosovo; that an international military force should
oversee peace on the ground; that Kosovo should be granted a wide
measure of autonomy; and that a multi-ethnic democracy should be
entrenched.
</P>
<P>
   To those five, some alliance leaders have added two more:
Milosevic must be overthrown; and a military victory must somehow
be won without NATO's forces fighting on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   These two extras, however desirable, should never have been
turned into outright aims _ not least because they may be mutually
incompatible. They should be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   As for autonomy and multi-ethnic democracy, after six weeks of
bombing and ethnic cleansing, they look more and more like distant
dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo, if it is to be anything, must for the foreseeable future
become some kind of international protectorate, ideally authorized
by the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Its final status and territorial shape can be left vague,
matters perhaps for a conference of interested parties in ten years
or so, when, who knows, other Balkan boundaries, maybe including
Bosnia's, can be redrawn.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, it would be unwise to insist now either on
independence for Kosovo as the sole road to a lasting peace or, as
some argue, on partitioning the province. Neither possibility
should be ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   The important points to emphasize, however, are that people of
all ethnic groups and religions should be free to live in peace in
Kosovo, and that Serbs should have access to their holy places.
</P>
<P>
   As for the overthrow of Milosevic as a precondition for peace,
as Britain's Tony Blair and several Americans have insisted, that
is unwise. His expulsion by force would probably prove hideously
difficult, as well as intensely controversial abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, today, even more than in the past, there is no serious
alternative to him as a leader of the Serbs. The war has
strengthened him at home, and most of those who might replace him
are as obnoxious as he is.
</P>
<P>
   It is peace, not war, that is likely to be his eventual undoing.
</P>
<P>
   The West's disavowal of a ground war was from the outset a
mistake. A huge buildup of troops, able to fight in Kosovo, would
not have been a commitment to use them, but would have provided the
option _ and created uncertainty in the enemy's mind.
</P>
<P>
   A decision to invade on the ground would, it is true, be a last
resort: it would be militarily difficult and politically divisive.
But such difficulties and divisions might be less grave than an
outright defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Bombing may yet do the trick, but it is not too late for NATO to
start building up its forces now, to be ready to go in if the worst
comes to the worst, and to intimidate Milosevic in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, far more Apache helicopters should be rushed in and
put to immediate ``tank-busting'' use. The slow, accident-prone
arrival of the first 24 has been one of the saddest examples of
NATO's unreadiness in this war.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to hesitate over an opposed invasion (a
logistical nightmare, whose costs might be very great). It is quite
another, and downright immoral, to conduct this action with the aim
of sustaining no allied casualties whatever, knowing that such a
policy means death and devastation for many innocent Kosovars (and
Serbs).
</P>
<P>
   With a bigger stick to hand, the West can also afford to talk,
using Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The allies and Russia have narrowed their differences enough to
prepare a joint statement this week, and further compromise should
be possible, on, for instance, a bombing pause during a Serb
military withdrawal, or the exact nature of the authority that is
to run Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But on the central issue of what should be at the core of the
peacekeeping force there should be no concession: it must be, in
essence, a NATO-run affair, preferably blessed, Bosnian-style, by
the U.N. and certainly including Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
   Peace or no peace, the West will have a huge refugee problem on
its hands. Germany has been conspicuously generous; other
countries, such as Britain, have been conspicuously ungenerous,
though that may be changing.
</P>
<P>
   Far more help must also go to Kosovo's neighbors, Albania and
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   But the top priority is that America, the key to the entire
affair, should steel itself for the possibility of a protracted war
involving allied casualties. Bill Clinton must recognize that
brutal truth, and tell the world forthwith. &QL;

   As for the overthrow of Milosevic as a precondition for peace,
as Britain's Tony Blair and several Americans have insisted, that
is unwise. His expulsion by force would probably prove hideously
difficult, as well as intensely controversial abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, today, even more than in the past, there is no serious
alternative to him as a leader of the Serbs. The war has
strengthened him at home, and most of those who might replace him
are as obnoxious as he is.
</P>
<P>
   It is peace, not war, that is likely to be his eventual undoing.
</P>
<P>
   The West's disavowal of a ground war was from the outset a
mistake. A huge buildup of troops, able to fight in Kosovo, would
not have been a commitment to use them, but would have provided the
option _ and created uncertainty in the enemy's mind.
</P>
<P>
   A decision to invade on the ground would, it is true, be a last
resort: it would be militarily difficult and politically divisive.
But such difficulties and divisions might be less grave than an
outright defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Bombing may yet do the trick, but it is not too late for NATO to
start building up its forces now, to be ready to go in if the worst
comes to the worst, and to intimidate Milosevic in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, far more Apache helicopters should be rushed in and
put to immediate ``tank-busting'' use. The slow, accident-prone
arrival of the first 24 has been one of the saddest examples of
NATO's unreadiness in this war.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to hesitate over an opposed invasion (a
logistical nightmare, whose costs might be very great). It is quite
another, and downright immoral, to conduct this action with the aim
of sustaining no allied casualties whatever, knowing that such a
policy means death and devastation for many innocent Kosovars (and
Serbs).
</P>
<P>
   With a bigger stick to hand, the West can also afford to talk,
using Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The allies and Russia have narrowed their differences enough to
prepare a joint statement this week, and further compromise should
be possible, on, for instance, a bombing pause during a Serb
military withdrawal, or the exact nature of the authority that is
to run Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But on the central issue of what should be at the core of the
peacekeeping force there should be no concession: it must be, in
essence, a NATO-run affair, preferably blessed, Bosnian-style, by
the U.N. and certainly including Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
   Peace or no peace, the West will have a huge refugee problem on
its hands. Germany has been conspicuously generous; other
countries, such as Britain, have been conspicuously ungenerous,
though that may be changing.
</P>
<P>
   Far more help must also go to Kosovo's neighbors, Albania and
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   But the top priority is that America, the key to the entire
affair, should steel itself for the possibility of a protracted war
involving allied casualties. Bill Clinton must recognize that
brutal truth, and tell the world forthwith. &QL;

   Perhaps Wan Azizah Ismail is not yet a household name, even in
her own country, Malaysia. But then it was not so long ago that few
people, outside of Arkansas, had heard of Hillary Rodham, yet now
it seems her political career may well continue long after her
husband's.
</P>
<P>
   What future then for Dr. Wan Azizah, the wife of Anwar Ibrahim,
formerly Malaysia's deputy prime minister and now its most famous
convict?
</P>
<P>
   She has just been in the Philippines, talking to Corazon Aquino.
Once Mrs. Aquino, too, was just the wife of a persecuted opposition
leader. She went on to become her country's president.
</P>
<P>
   All right, the Philippines is not Malaysia, and history seldom
repeats itself exactly, in Asia or anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it sometimes seems that Asian women who want to get on in
politics would be well advised simply to marry a man with the same
ambition. Even if that fails to get them to the top, it may be that
their daughter, or daughter-in-law, will fulfill their ambition.
</P>
<P>
   The downside, it should be added, is a seriously disturbed
family life, usually involving exile, imprisonment and, almost
invariably, assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Widows' politics is especially eye-catching in the Philippines
because of the personalities involved: the redoubtable Mrs. Aquino
and the well-heeled, indeed well-shod, Imelda Marcos, whose husband
was the dictator Mrs. Aquino deposed.
</P>
<P>
   The Philippine variant of this kind of politics exhibits some
familiar features _ Benigno Aquino was assassinated, Ferdinand
Marcos died in exile _ but it has yet to develop fully into a
multigenerational affair.
</P>
<P>
   There are some signs of that in Myanmar, where Aung San Suu Kyi,
even under house arrest, bravely carries the torch for democracy
amid the darkness imposed by the ruling junta.
</P>
<P>
   She is the daughter of Aung San, who negotiated his country's
independence but did not live to see it: he was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia, the independence leader was Sukarno. His daughter,
Megawati, hopes to win the presidency in next month's election.
</P>
<P>
   For the genre in its most elaborate form, however, go to Sri
Lanka, where the president, Chandrika Kumaratunga, is the daughter
of two prime ministers. Dad came first, but was, yes, assassinated,
in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Mum, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, took over in 1960, becoming the
world's first elected female head of government. She no longer has
that job, but she is still prime minister (the post carries much
less weight now). Mrs. Kumaratunga's husband was assassinated in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries in South Asia are also exponents of widows' and
daughters' politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bangladesh, for example, is these days alternately ruled by
Sheikh Hasina Wajed, the current prime minister, and Khaleda Zia,
her predecessor. The former is the daughter of Sheikh Mujib ur
Rahman, the country's first prime minister, assassinated in 1975;
the latter the relict of President Zia Rahman, assassinated six
years later.
</P>
<P>
   In Pakistan, Benazir Bhutto is a former prime minister, no
stranger to either jail or exile; her father, an earlier prime
minister, was hanged, or, as some would say, judicially
assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   It takes the world's biggest democracy, however, to produce
Asia's greatest dynasty, replete with both daughters' and widows'
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister, begat Indira
Gandhi, its third and sixth prime minister (assassinated 1984), who
begat Rajiv, its seventh (assassinated 1991), whose widow, Sonia,
now hopes to become its 15th.
</P>
<P>
   So what conclusion should Dr. Wan Azizah draw from all this?
Certainly, that politics can be a dangerous avocation in Asia, for
women as for men. But perhaps too that wives and daughters perform
no worse, as a rule, than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it would be nice to see more women win power on their
merits, not on their husbands' or fathers' names.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the most popular alternative route, at least in
India, is through the movies _ and that, to judge by the capers of
Jayaram Jayalalitha, who has just brought down the Indian
government, hardly seems to engender a sense of responsibility. &QL;

   ``When circulating libraries were first opened,'' wrote Charles
Knight in 1854, ``the booksellers were much alarmed; and their
rapid increase added to their fears, and led them to think that the
sale of books would be much diminished by such libraries.
</P>
<P>
   ``But experience has proved that the sale of books, so far from
being diminished by them, has been greatly promoted.''
</P>
<P>
   As it was with books in the late 18th century, so it is with
music today.
</P>
<P>
   A new distribution channel has opened: the Internet. The
question is whether its impact on today's music business will be as
benign as the impact of libraries was on the bookselling business.
</P>
<P>
   After all, today, bookselling still booms _ and, indeed, now
flourishes online, where a bookseller has become the best-known
brand. The circulating libraries are gone.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, it looked as though the Internet might ring the
death knell of the music business.
</P>
<P>
   Because music is so easily compressed and sold online, the
record companies feared that their intellectual property would be
stolen by the bucketful. With the help of a common standard adopted
by websites, consumers and hardware producers, Internet music
boomed and sales of CDs to the young declined.
</P>
<P>
   Panic-stricken, the companies rang their lawyers; they sent
fierce letters to colleges, warning students against piracy; they
sued one of the producers of the devices on to which music can be
downloaded; and they forced bands to remove tracks that they had
posted on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, technology seems likely to rescue the music
companies from the threat technology has created.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are trying to replace the Internet's standard for
digital download with their own, which would allow them to encrypt
their product, and thus protect their copyright.
</P>
<P>
   On May 4 the first of the big music companies, Universal,
announced plans to sell music online. As a result, music is likely
to become the most valuable product to make the move from the
physical world to the virtual.
</P>
<P>
   By selling their wares online, the record companies will not
only save the costs of manufacturing and distribution. They will
save on stocks _ indeed, they will be able to keep unlimited
supplies of golden oldies, since the virtual world offers unlimited
storage space.
</P>
<P>
   And they will get rid of the costly business of dealing with
returns of CDs that flop, because nobody will buy them in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   For music-lovers, this is a happy song. Scrapping distribution
costs means slashing the price of music _ and probably bypassing
the taxman too, in many countries.
</P>
<P>
   It means quick access to new music. For the massed ranks of the
middle-aged who have neither the time nor the inclination to hang
out in record stores, rubbing stubble with the hip, it means pure
joy: at the click of a mouse, they will be able to download that
seminal Beach Boys album.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder online sales are already broadening the customer base.
</P>
<P>
   For record stores, though, this is glum news. Unless they can
find a new role _ as music clubs, perhaps, or coffee houses _ their
days are limited.
</P>
<P>
   And for the record companies themselves, this will be a mixed
blessing. Between them, they control most of the music that has
ever been recorded _ including that ancient Beach Boys special,
whose initial costs have long since been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Back lists will thus be played con brio and with profit. But,
like publishers, airlines, stockbrokers and any other firm whose
product can be readily distributed online, the record companies now
have to rethink the way they do business.
</P>
<P>
   If they no longer make and distribute CDs, what are they for?
Plugging artists, presumably. But here there is plenty of
competition _ from agents, from managers, even the artists
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, manufacturing plants and distribution networks
created sizeable barriers to entry which kept upstarts out of the
record companies' business. In the new world, physical capital is a
costly overhead, not a protection.
</P>
<P>
   In this new era, the record companies have a further
disadvantage: everybody dislikes them. Artists dislike them because
they think the record companies rip them off. Consumers dislike
them because the artists dislike them.
</P>
<P>
   Because Internet businesses are increasingly about building a
community of loyal users, record companies must learn to be loved
if they are to flourish like booksellers rather than go the way of
the circulating library. &QL;

<P>
   At one point, it looked as though the Internet might ring the
death knell of the music business.
</P>
<P>
   Because music is so easily compressed and sold online, the
record companies feared that their intellectual property would be
stolen by the bucketful. With the help of a common standard adopted
by websites, consumers and hardware producers, Internet music
boomed and sales of CDs to the young declined.
</P>
<P>
   Panic-stricken, the companies rang their lawyers; they sent
fierce letters to colleges, warning students against piracy; they
sued one of the producers of the devices on to which music can be
downloaded; and they forced bands to remove tracks that they had
posted on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, technology seems likely to rescue the music
companies from the threat technology has created.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are trying to replace the Internet's standard for
digital download with their own, which would allow them to encrypt
their product, and thus protect their copyright.
</P>
<P>
   On May 4 the first of the big music companies, Universal,
announced plans to sell music online. As a result, music is likely
to become the most valuable product to make the move from the
physical world to the virtual.
</P>
<P>
   By selling their wares online, the record companies will not
only save the costs of manufacturing and distribution. They will
save on stocks _ indeed, they will be able to keep unlimited
supplies of golden oldies, since the virtual world offers unlimited
storage space.
</P>
<P>
   And they will get rid of the costly business of dealing with
returns of CDs that flop, because nobody will buy them in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   For music-lovers, this is a happy song. Scrapping distribution
costs means slashing the price of music _ and probably bypassing
the taxman too, in many countries.
</P>
<P>
   It means quick access to new music. For the massed ranks of the
middle-aged who have neither the time nor the inclination to hang
out in record stores, rubbing stubble with the hip, it means pure
joy: at the click of a mouse, they will be able to download that
seminal Beach Boys album.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder online sales are already broadening the customer base.
</P>
<P>
   For record stores, though, this is glum news. Unless they can
find a new role _ as music clubs, perhaps, or coffee houses _ their
days are limited.
</P>
<P>
   And for the record companies themselves, this will be a mixed
blessing. Between them, they control most of the music that has
ever been recorded _ including that ancient Beach Boys special,
whose initial costs have long since been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Back lists will thus be played con brio and with profit. But,
like publishers, airlines, stockbrokers and any other firm whose
product can be readily distributed online, the record companies now
have to rethink the way they do business.
</P>
<P>
   If they no longer make and distribute CDs, what are they for?
Plugging artists, presumably. But here there is plenty of
competition _ from agents, from managers, even the artists
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, manufacturing plants and distribution networks
created sizeable barriers to entry which kept upstarts out of the
record companies' business. In the new world, physical capital is a
costly overhead, not a protection.
</P>
<P>
   In this new era, the record companies have a further
disadvantage: everybody dislikes them. Artists dislike them because
they think the record companies rip them off. Consumers dislike
them because the artists dislike them.
</P>
<P>
   Because Internet businesses are increasingly about building a
community of loyal users, record companies must learn to be loved
if they are to flourish like booksellers rather than go the way of
the circulating library. &QL;

   ``When circulating libraries were first opened,'' wrote Charles
Knight in 1854, ``the booksellers were much alarmed; and their
rapid increase added to their fears, and led them to think that the
sale of books would be much diminished by such libraries.
</P>
<P>
   ``But experience has proved that the sale of books, so far from
being diminished by them, has been greatly promoted.''
</P>
<P>
   As it was with books in the late 18th century, so it is with
music today.
</P>
<P>
   A new distribution channel has opened: the Internet. The
question is whether its impact on today's music business will be as
benign as the impact of libraries was on the bookselling business.
</P>
<P>
   After all, today, bookselling still booms _ and, indeed, now
flourishes online, where a bookseller has become the best-known
brand. The circulating libraries are gone.

   The contours of a settlement for Kosovo were sketched out at a
meeting of Russian and western foreign ministers on May 6 in Bonn,
though not the all-important details.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably too soon to proclaim an early peace. But the
developments are bad news for Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Using careful diplomatic language to paper over their
differences, the ministers agreed that an ``effective international
civil and security presence'' would be needed to police any peace
deal and to oversee the return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   In a huge step towards imposing an international protectorate on
Kosovo, they also called for an ``interim administration'' of the
province which would be appointed by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The gradual _ but not total _ convergence of Russian and western
views on Kosovo is potentially a much greater threat to Milosevic
than NATO's continuing bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   The allies' strikes managed this week to disrupt Serbia's
electricity system but have still had trouble in finding enemy
aircraft and armor.
</P>
<P>
   Joschka Fischer, the German foreign minister, said after playing
host to his colleagues from the G7 rich nations and Russia that it
was too early to speak of an immediate halt to NATO's bombs.
</P>
<P>
   But the breakthrough in Bonn could pave the way for a U.N.
Security Council resolution that would lend international authority
to a peace formula and redouble the pressure on Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Milosevic, though, there are important issues on
which the West and Russia remain at odds, despite this week's visit
to Washington by Viktor Chernomyrdin, acting as President Boris
Yeltsin's Kosovo envoy.
</P>
<P>
   At least some senior Russians, including Igor Sergeyev, the
defense minister, sympathize with Serbia's insistence that western
countries which have taken part in bombing have no moral right to
police a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, for its part, insists on forming the main component of any
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that Russia and the West are talking, rather than
rattling sabres at each other, must disappoint those in Belgrade
still hoping that Russia will switch from passive to active support
of the Serb cause.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, reckons that Russia has
become more favorable to cooperating with NATO since the alliance
rejected British calls for an open commitment to a ground war.
Serbia's hawks have certainly held the view that Russia would
switch back to a more firmly anti-western position if NATO embarked
on a ground war.
</P>
<P>
   Hints of what this could mean have been provided, in recent
days, by the Russian Security Council's call for a new nuclear
doctrine. In any event, Milosevic is unlikely to rely too heavily
on the uncertain prospect of Russian support.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing that he might lose his (hitherto impressive) ability to
set the pace of events, Milosevic has been taking every available
opportunity to set off diplomatic fireworks of his own.
</P>
<P>
   His decision over the May Day weekend to free three captured
American servicemen _ in response to an appeal from Jesse Jackson,
a pastor-politician _ was accompanied by a stream of proposals for
direct talks with President Bill Clinton, as well as appeals to the
American people.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is also working on a peace plan of his own, which
would provide for a lightly armed U.N. police force, including a
large Russian component and NATO countries such as Greece,
Portugal, Hungary and Poland, which have not dropped any bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The most eye-catching gesture was the release of Ibrahim Rugova,
the Kosovar Albanians' moderate leader, who has been under Serb
``protection'' in recent weeks, to talk peace in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another diplomatic initiative is being jointly pursued by
some American legislators, including a Republican arms-control
expert, Curt Weldon, and members of the Russian parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Hovering in the background of their meeting in Vienna last week,
which produced agreement on the broad outlines of a settlement, was
the influential figure of Dragan Karic, one of three Serbian
brothers whose business empire straddles Moscow and Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   As though to underline the gap between these initiatives and
anything he might accept, Clinton promised during a visit to an
American base in Germany this week to ``intensify...in an
unrelenting way'' the air attacks against Serbia until the
objectives were met.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, on a trip to NATO headquarters in Brussels, he had
agreed with alliance commanders on the need for a large force to be
ready to roll into Kosovo to escort refugees home ``once we have
prevailed'' _ through bombing. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   General Hugh Shelton, the chairman of America's joint chiefs of
staff, issued a grim warning against the assumption that incoming
NATO troops would have an easy time of it.
</P>
<P>
   If, he insisted, circumstances in Kosovo were
``non-permissive...we'll assume we could face hostile action and
prepare our forces accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports from the war zone, meanwhile, suggested a close
correlation between the intensity of NATO's air strikes and the
brutality of the Serbs' repression _ but not of the kind NATO
intended.
</P>
<P>
   On May 3, for example, NATO claimed its ``most successful'' day
of bombing so far, with attacks on tanks and artillery in Kosovo
and about 40 fixed targets elsewhere in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, an exceptionally brutal round of ethnic
cleansing was carried out by the Serbs, with sickening atrocities
reported around Vucitrn and Podujevo in northern Kosovo, as well as
Prizren in the south.
</P>
<P>
   The latest refugees arriving by tractor in Albania and by train
in Macedonia are hungry, exhausted and traumatized by experiences
whose horror far exceeds that of the opening weeks of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Many have seen close relations sadistically murdered, and walked
past piles of newly slaughtered, often mutilated, bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Their stories, and physical condition, have shocked the most
hardened aid workers. But NATO acknowledges there is little it can
do immediately to prevent such horrors or even to ward off the
threat of starvation among Kosovo's internally displaced people.
</P>
<P>
   NATO forces in both Albania and Macedonia are vulnerable to
Serbia's Orkan multiple rocket-launchers, and America's
much-vaunted fleet of 24 Apache helicopters, deployed in Albania,
suffered a second crash this week, resulting in NATO's first two
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the darkest assessment of NATO's progress was offered by
the outgoing chairman of the alliance's Military Committee, General
Klaus Naumann, a German, on May 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly and honestly, we did not succeed in our initial
attempt to coerce Milosevic through air strikes to accept our
demands, nor did we succeed in preventing Yugoslavia from pursuing
a campaign of ethnic separation and expulsion,'' he conceded.
</P>
<P>
   NATO might have fared better, he suggested, if it had dropped
even more bombs even sooner, and been less constrained by the need
to avoid hitting civilians, churches and mosques.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, there was still a ``real chance we can make it'' and
prevail in Kosovo through air power alone, the general thought. But
it was also possible, he admitted, that Milosevic might succeed in
his plan to deport the entire ethnic-Albanian population. &QL;

   As though to underline the gap between these initiatives and
anything he might accept, Clinton promised during a visit to an
American base in Germany this week to ``intensify...in an
unrelenting way'' the air attacks against Serbia until the
objectives were met.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, on a trip to NATO headquarters in Brussels, he had
agreed with alliance commanders on the need for a large force to be
ready to roll into Kosovo to escort refugees home ``once we have
prevailed'' _ through bombing. &QL;

   General Hugh Shelton, the chairman of America's joint chiefs of
staff, issued a grim warning against the assumption that incoming
NATO troops would have an easy time of it.
</P>
<P>
   If, he insisted, circumstances in Kosovo were
``non-permissive...we'll assume we could face hostile action and
prepare our forces accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports from the war zone, meanwhile, suggested a close
correlation between the intensity of NATO's air strikes and the
brutality of the Serbs' repression _ but not of the kind NATO
intended.
</P>
<P>
   On May 3, for example, NATO claimed its ``most successful'' day
of bombing so far, with attacks on tanks and artillery in Kosovo
and about 40 fixed targets elsewhere in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, an exceptionally brutal round of ethnic
cleansing was carried out by the Serbs, with sickening atrocities
reported around Vucitrn and Podujevo in northern Kosovo, as well as
Prizren in the south.
</P>
<P>
   The latest refugees arriving by tractor in Albania and by train
in Macedonia are hungry, exhausted and traumatized by experiences
whose horror far exceeds that of the opening weeks of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Many have seen close relations sadistically murdered, and walked
past piles of newly slaughtered, often mutilated, bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Their stories, and physical condition, have shocked the most
hardened aid workers. But NATO acknowledges there is little it can
do immediately to prevent such horrors or even to ward off the
threat of starvation among Kosovo's internally displaced people.
</P>
<P>
   NATO forces in both Albania and Macedonia are vulnerable to
Serbia's Orkan multiple rocket-launchers, and America's
much-vaunted fleet of 24 Apache helicopters, deployed in Albania,
suffered a second crash this week, resulting in NATO's first two
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the darkest assessment of NATO's progress was offered by
the outgoing chairman of the alliance's Military Committee, General
Klaus Naumann, a German, on May 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly and honestly, we did not succeed in our initial
attempt to coerce Milosevic through air strikes to accept our
demands, nor did we succeed in preventing Yugoslavia from pursuing
a campaign of ethnic separation and expulsion,'' he conceded.
</P>
<P>
   NATO might have fared better, he suggested, if it had dropped
even more bombs even sooner, and been less constrained by the need
to avoid hitting civilians, churches and mosques.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, there was still a ``real chance we can make it'' and
prevail in Kosovo through air power alone, the general thought. But
it was also possible, he admitted, that Milosevic might succeed in
his plan to deport the entire ethnic-Albanian population. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Time was when Latin American governments tried to do everything,
from industrialization on. They had some successes, and then,
mostly, got bogged down (or worse).
</P>
<P>
   Then _ headed by Chile's military regime, which had inherited an
extensively statist economy from the socialist government it
overthrew in 1973 _ they discovered privatization. On the block
went public-sector industries and banks, oil and mining, utilities,
transport, telecoms.
</P>
<P>
   Now the privatizers have a new target: the welfare state, in
particular, health care.
</P>
<P>
   Most countries in the region began to develop social-security
systems in the 1940s; some even earlier.
</P>
<P>
   These schemes, providing pensions and health care to the new
urban middle classes, did much in their early decades, becoming as
popular and entrenched as their European equivalents. But monopoly,
mismanagement and lack of money led many to become ineffective,
often inequitable and sometimes corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Now-spurred on by the World Bank and the Inter-American
Development Bank, both eager to diversify beyond infrastructure
lending-governments are turning to the market to put things right.
</P>
<P>
   Though the region's new democrats dislike admitting it, it was
the Pinochet regime in Chile that led the way in social services,
as it had in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, it inherited over 250 state enterprises. By 1980, it
had cut the total to fewer than 50. That was bold, maybe, but not
amazing: in 1970, before President Salvador Allende set to work,
the figure had been only 20 higher.
</P>
<P>
   What followed in 1981 was far bolder, almost unthinkable at the
time: Chileans got the right to opt out of the state health
service.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they were offered a choice of new, private-sector
health insurers, known as Isapres. These bodies act like American
health-maintenance organizations, HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   They contract with hospitals and doctors to provide care, or
manage and hire for themselves. They have flourished. In 1981,
62,000 Chileans entrusted their health care to Isapres; by 1998,
some 3.8 million, about a quarter of the entire population.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the shift was not easy. The similar opt-out provision
introduced in 1981 for pensions was soon popular _ within a year 30
percent of eligible Chileans had made the switch _ and has been
widely imitated elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Health has proved trickier. Privatizing pensions costs
relatively few public-sector jobs, and has (mostly) met only mild
opposition, whether from ideological foes or the trade unions
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Health care, in contrast, is highly labor-intensive. The unions
tend to be strong, and fear that many thousands of jobs are at
risk.
</P>
<P>
   True, new private-sector jobs would be created in their place,
but no longer under union control. The Pinochet regime had its own
crude ways of dealing with union opposition. Later reforms
elsewhere have involved hard-fought political battles.
</P>
<P>
   There are other big differences. A pension is easily measured.
Health care is not. As in the United States, private-sector
insurers in Latin America face suspicion that they will cut corners
in treatment (and, conversely, that doctors will try to earn extra
fees _ part of which still fall on the user, albeit insured _ by
carrying out unneeded procedures).
</P>
<P>
   And the range of costs is far wider: some people are healthy
most of the time, some chronically ill for years on end. So there
has to be greater cross-subsidy-between rich and poor, healthy and
sick _ and more regulation, to ensure that all get tolerably equal
access to similar levels of care. In short, more politics.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that even in rich Europe (ask Britain's Conservative
Party) voters distrust the idea of taking the state out of medical
care.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Chile's example has been followed. In 1993 Colombia
opened the way for people to opt for private health insurers, known
there as EPSs.
</P>
<P>
   This reform sought to bring in the efficiencies and consumer
satisfaction that had won Chile's Isapres public acceptance, but
also to offer better care to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The main way to that was to bring more people into the
social-security net: coverage rose from 6 million in 1993 to 22
million in 1996, including 7 million poorer folk whose premiums are
paid by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Peru is now creating a similar system. At the start of this
year, its social-security institute, Essalud, was told that it too
would have to compete with private EPSs for members; it may also
contract with an EPS to provide care.
</P>
<P>
   For now, EPSs will handle only primary and out-patient services,
leaving Essalud to provide hospital care. But the goal is
competition across the board.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina is moving in the same direction, though timidly, and
against much resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Its workers and their families have traditionally had compulsory
health insurance with one of more than 200 obras sociales, operated
by their respective trade union. These are often small, inefficient
and, sometimes, corruptly managed.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1996 a decree allowed the 18 million people involved at
least to choose a rival union's obra. But not many have done so.
</P>
<P>
   Reformers in Mexico seem keen to follow the trend. A 1995 law _
it also opened the way to private pensions _ already allows
opted-out health care. But it has not been fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has already seen a large switch to the private sector _
less by design than because of discontent with the state system
since it was opened to all comers in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Over 45 million Brazilians were covered by private health plans
in 1998, four times the 1988 figure. Many others are treated in
private hospitals, under contract to the public system. Coverage
and levels of treatment vary widely from one city or state to the
next.
</P>
<P>
   Greater uniformity may be difficult, given Brazil's
decentralized system. The central government is concentrating on
encouraging more efficient contracting-out and on regulating the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Why make the change? Why have Latin American governments become
ready to privatize health care, when in Europe (and Canada)
governments have been decidedly less bold?
</P>
<P>
   One reason is external prompting and support. Last year Mexico
benefited from a World Bank loan of $750 million, mostly directed
at ``structural'' change in the social-security institute's
health-care operations. That is the biggest loan the Bank has ever
made for health care.
</P>
<P>
   The Inter-American Development Bank too is pushing market-based
reforms. It hired Juan Luis Londono, the Colombian health minister
responsible for the 1993 reforms, to help.
</P>
<P>
   The two banks have begun an unusual joint loan of $650 million
to Brazil, mainly to stimulate health-sector reform.
</P>
<P>
   But the impetus for change comes also _ and quite as strongly _
from within: from a new breed of policymaker within Latin America's
finance and health ministries.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Griffin, the World Bank's foremost health specialist for
the region, says these officials, home-grown though often armed
with economics degrees from North American universities, are
producing unprecedented and welcome ``creativity and risk-taking''
throughout the area. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,150. OPTIONAL COPY FOLLOWS TO 1,300) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Chilean Isapres and Colombian EPSs are launching themselves
abroad, marketing their experience of middle-income markets.
Conversely, foreign managed-care providers are entering the region
rapidly, especially from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Lewis, the president of the American Association of
Health Plans, explains why: ``450 million Latin Americans
constitute a health-care market of $120 billion a year _ of which
only 15 percent is spent on private insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   The care at present on offer, he points out, is of uneven
quality, and, in the public sector, usually underfinanced.
</P>
<P>
   It is also rationed by income. Though insured, users have to pay
much of their health-care costs themselves; on average 45 percent
of total spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a perfect environment for managed care to demonstrate
its commitment to cost-effective, high-quality health care,''
claims Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   American HMOs will have to adapt their ways and their costs to
this new market-to ``tropicalize'' as one executive puts it. But
the potential is huge.
</P>
<P>
   Home-grown or foreign-controlled, private-sector providers will
be grabbing for, and probably getting, an ever larger share of it. &QL;

   TORONTO _ He had wasted enough of his life. Frivolity was no
longer a luxury. It was time to get serious, to settle upon a
career, to map out a path to achieve it.
</P>
<P>
   He sat down with his mother for a heart-to-heart talk. He was
going to attend college in the States, he told her. He'd done
exhaustive research at the local library and determined that the
educational system south of the border was superior to Canada's. He
would get his US degree, he explained, and proceed to medical
school. He was going to be a doctor. An orthopedic surgeon. It was
settled.
</P>
<P>
   He was 8 years old.
</P>
<P>
   All right, so a young child's ambitions rarely work out exactly
as planned. That doesn't mean they have to be abandoned. Just
refined a little.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of becoming a US physician would be prohibitive, he
eventually told his mother. He didn't want to saddle his parents
with such a crushing expense. But this game she hadn't wanted him
to play, this ice hockey, could be more than just winter fun. It
was a means with potential. Some US colleges _ top-flight US
colleges _ awarded scholarships to young men with skating and
studying skills, he'd discovered. And he had both. So this was to
be his pathway. Hockey would pay his way to college _ a Central
Collegiate Hockey Association college, he specified, so he would be
close enough to home that his parents could watch him play. That
would set the stage for his career in orthopedics.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and one other thing. He would be deferring medical school
for a while. Until he was through playing in the National Hockey
League.
</P>
<P>
   Now this was a mature life plan, with all the particulars filled
in.
</P>
<P>
   He was 14 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Anson Carter's parents laugh about it now as they sit in the
living room of their tidy two-story brick house in the middle-class
Scarborough section of this city. Sure enough, their boy attended a
fine US college, Michigan State _ a CCHA school, of course. Sure
enough, a hockey scholarship paid for his studies. And sure enough,
he's playing in the NHL. There he is right in front of them on the
television, brought to them courtesy of the small satellite dish
atop their roof, playing left wing for the Bruins in the opener of
their Eastern Conference semifinal against the Buffalo Sabres, a
surprising advancement he helped Boston achieve with a pair of
vital goals against the Carolina Hurricanes in the first round,
when he showed flashes of becoming an emerging star.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he still has a couple of courses to go for his degree,''
points out his mother, Valma. ``So he's done two of the three
things he said he would.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, considering the grandiose nature of his prepubescent and
adolescent predictions, that's a remarkable percentage. Who would
have believed it?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not his parents, Horace and Valma. ``We used to laugh
at that so much,'' says his mother, recalling those career
objectives that seemed to be more delirium than design. ``We
thought it was a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they should have known better. ``I had a pretty good
grasp of things at the time,'' says Carter. ``I knew exactly where
I wanted to be, what I wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, from the time he was 4 years old, when he vainly tried
to persuade his parents to let him play ice hockey, Anson Carter
was not one to kid about such things.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Anson, he can be so serious,'' says Valma. ``Sometimes
he's boring.''
</P>
<P>
   His parents never will face such accusations. Horace and Valma
Carter, who emigrated from their native Barbados some 30 years ago,
are people of accomplishment who don't take themselves too
seriously. They laugh easily, downplay their roles in Anson's
development, and are just as proud of their daughter Michelle, 27,
who works in human resources at a telecommunications company, and
son David, 19, a student at St. Clair College, as they are of their
25-year-old hockey star.
</P>
<P>
   Horace and Valma were teachers in Barbados who switched careers
after arriving in Canada. Horace, 58, became an assessor with
Revenue Canada, from which he retired eight years ago. Valma, 55,
still works in communications for the Ministry of Transportation.
But there is no doubt about their priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Barbados,'' says Valma, ``a lot of emphasis is placed on
education. If the educational standards are being met, then fine if
you want to do sports.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hockey was a bonus,'' says Horace.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, hockey was out of the question when Anson initially
approached his parents for permission to play. He spent much of his
free time with the older kids in the neighborhood playing street
hockey, and as would prove to be the case in all sports he tried,
he mastered the game immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anson was the type of kid who was always ahead of the class,''
says Valma. ``He was very gifted in everything _ school,
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   And to his way of thinking, if he could handle the game on
macadam, why not on ice?
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the main reasons I wanted to play ice hockey was that
I'd take a lot heat from my friends,'' says Carter. ``I'd make a
move on them in street hockey and they'd jab me: `You couldn't do
that on the ice.' It drove me to prove people wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, Anson could skate. Just not well. He would join
Michelle, a relatively accomplished skater, on the ponds, ``and he
was kind of shaky,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But he was persistent, too. For four years, he kept at his
parents. ``He persevered and persevered,'' says Valma, meaning he
pestered them to distraction.
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't use grades as a reason to deny him. Earning
straight A's from the start, he passed a test at age 7 to attend a
school for gifted students, but his parents wouldn't allow the move
when he pleaded in tears that he didn't want to leave his friends.
His second-grade teacher's alternative, that he skip a grade, was
rejected for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the teacher always had to find extra work for him,'' says
Valma. ``The regular work was never enough for him. It was that way
all through public school.''
</P>
<P>
   Anson acknowledges this, but don't be deceived, he warns. He was
serious but not a nerd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd get in trouble with teachers and at recess because I was
confident and wanted to express myself,'' he says. ``I had a lot of
focus in some areas, but in others, you could look at me and say,
`That kid has no direction.' I'd pick my spots.''
</P>
<P>
   One of them was hockey. But he still made no headway at home,
though he was undeterred. Even when he became an instant star in
baseball as a pitcher and shortstop, his appeals to get a crack at
the rink continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd say, `Baseball is a US sport; I won't be good enough to
play in college there,' '' recalls Valma. ``I don't know why, but
he was a man on a mission to play hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he found an opening when he was 8 and his parents
decided to let Michelle give soccer a try. If she could play the
sport she wanted, he argued, why couldn't he? ``Leverage,'' he
calls it now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leverage?'' says Valma, exploding in laughter as she is
advised of this. ``That sounds like Anson.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked. While his parents weren't sold on his skating, they
gave him permission to join the local youth league. As a show of
good faith, his father created a rink at home, flooding the
backyard during the winter.
</P>
<P>
   And opening the floodgates.
</P>
<P>
   As calculated as his career course seems, happenstance may have
been the key ingredient. Almost by accident, Brian Ballantine
became his first hockey coach, ``and without Brian,'' says Horace,
``I don't think the rest of it would have happened. No matter who
his coach has been since, Anson always says, `Brian laid the
groundwork.' We were just lucky, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling is mutual. ``When you coach 25 years and get a kid
like Anson,'' says Ballantine, a full-time Seattle Mariners scout
and former major junior goaltender, ``you're lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballantine is sitting in the lobby of Commander Park Arena, a
two-rink facility set in the back of an industrial development a
few blocks from the Carter home. He recalls how he inadvertently
discovered Carter while coaching the Agincourt Lions, an all-star
team of 8-year-olds that is part of the 540-player Scarborough
Hockey Association.
</P>
<P>
   His roster was full and Anson had been late signing up,
Ballantine remembers, but it turned out one of the Lions lived
outside the district, rendering him ineligible. After two or three
weeks of watching Carter play in-house games, he gave him the
roster spot, despite a familiar misgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a poor skater,'' says Ballantine. ``I mean, he couldn't
skate that first year; they were a size too big. But he was big and
aggressive, good with the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter worked diligently on his shortcomings his first year,
participating in power-skating drills and going out on his own to a
pond in a neighborhood construction area.
</P>
<P>
   Ballantine liked that work ethic. And something else. The
newcomer seemed to instantly absorb whatever he was taught.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you did it in practice,'' says Ballantine, ``he'd do it in
the next game. And he wouldn't forget. He'd do it again later in
the season.''
</P>
<P>
   He never was a strong skater during his five years with
Ballantine. He certainly didn't have the flash of the left wing on
the line he centered, Adrian Sciarra, whose father, Pat, sponsored
the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``That drove me, too,'' says Carter. ``He was a year younger,
and he was so impressive with all those flashy moves. I said, `He's
a year younger. I think I'm a pretty good player, too. I should be
able to do that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He never did, not in his five years with Ballantine. But his
other assets were undeniable.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of that first year,'' says Sciarra, now an area
manager for a window cleaning company, ``he was obviously the best
player in the league. And by the time he was 12, it was obvious he
was going to go a lot further than we were.''
</P>
<P>
   Because somehow he just kept emerging as the star. When he was
10, he was named MVP of an international tournament in Boston, his
first exposure to checking.

NATO STILL STUCK IN THE SLOW LANE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If Sun Tzu were still around, he would not look
kindly on the NATO air war in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the nature of an army to stress speed,'' the Chinese
strategist wrote more than 2,000 years ago in his seminal text,
``The Art of War.'' The point of speed is to get to the battlefield
first, then to shock, disorient, demoralize, and ultimately defeat
the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after six weeks of dropping bombs, NATO's Operation Allied
Force has proved most notable for how slowly it got under way.
Diplomatic efforts, stepped up the past several days, may soon end
the war, but not before Slobodan Milosevic has accomplished his
main objective of ``cleansing'' Kosovo of its ethnic Albanians, a
process that NATO's bombing, for all its ferocity, did nothing to
stop or deter.
</P>
<P>
   The question is: Could NATO forces have arrived in time at least
to have impeded the slaughter?
</P>
<P>
   In part, the dragged-out pace of the operation might be
attributed to the nature of alliance warfare, in which each of 19
democratically elected governments has a say over what targets can
be hit and whether certain options _ like sending in ground troops
_ can be contemplated, much less put in motion.
</P>
<P>
   However, military specialists say the sluggishness is also a
result of the structure of the US armed forces _ a cumbersome,
four-headed bureaucracy (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines) that,
nearly a decade after the collapse of the Soviet Union, remains
tied to its Cold War moorings.
</P>
<P>
   Through the 40 years of East-West confrontation, US war planners
built massive forces of heavy armor, deployed them in fixed
positions (mainly in Germany and Korea), and trained the troops, by
and large, for one kind of contest.
</P>
<P>
   In the post-Cold War era, however, Presidents Bush and Clinton
have mobilized troops for dozens of crises, near and far. This
calls out for a force more agile, more easily transported, and more
flexibly trained.
</P>
<P>
   Military commanders have started to make adjustments of just
this sort. However, the efforts either have been half-hearted or
too recent to have any effect on the current conflict.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Army has initiated a concept called ``Force
XXI'' that aims to replace old-fashioned divisions, each of which
has about 20,000 soldiers, with Strike Forces, units of 3,000 to
5,000 troops tailored to specific missions and organized for rapid
deployment anywhere. However, the first experimental Strike Force
will not be ready for action until 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't completed all the analytical work in terms of war
games . . . models and simulations,'' General John N. Abrams,
commander of the Army's Training and Doctrine Command, said in a
news release last month announcing the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has been working on similarly scaled-down units,
called Airborne Expeditionary Forces. Organizational charts show 10
of these units, each composed of 150 aircraft, mixed and matched to
perform specific missions. While the Air Force concept has moved
farther along than the Army's, officials say it still is more
theoretical than real.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, when a president wants to dispatch troops, military
commanders have to dip into the large divisions, usually into
several at once, and to pull out the elements needed.
</P>
<P>
   This is one reason it took three weeks for 24 Apache
tank-hunting helicopters to arrive in Albania. Some of these were
taken from Army divisions in Germany, others from the United
States. M-1 Abrams tanks and M-2 Bradley fighting vehicles, sent to
protect the helicopters, were taken from other units. Some supplies
and support gear, as well as the trucks and jeeps to carry them,
came from still different units.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting all these things together isn't as easy as it might
seem,'' said Frances Lussier, a military analyst at the Rand
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Less than one-third of US troops are based overseas at any one
time, down from one-half 10 years ago, and regulations make it hard
to send more. Many soldiers are exempt from being sent abroad, such
as those who have served there in the past year or whose terms in
the military expire within 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   So when the officer in charge of an Apache task force calls up a
commander and asks for M-1 tank crews, it might take a while to
find some who can go.
</P>
<P>
   Lussier calculated that it would take two or three months to
send 100,000 troops to Yugoslavia. ``At least a month of that,''
she said, would be the time it takes to assemble the elements.
</P>
<P>
   Once the commanders figure out who is going, they and their
weapons and logistical supplies are sent on special airlift cargo
planes and sealift ships. Ships carry a lot, but move slowly.
Planes are fast, but can't carry much. (The largest cargo-transport
planes, the C-5 and C-17, can carry only one or two tanks each and
nothing more.)
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, the Pentagon has spent a lot of money on
airlifts and sealifts. Even as the number of US combat troops has
declined by a third, the number of cargo planes and ships has
risen.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration plans to spend $20 billion on the
lifts during the next four years. With operations and maintenance
costs, that balloons to $54 billion by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   This new emphasis on cargo transport grew out of the 1991
Persian Gulf War, when it took seven months to move enough troops
and weapons into the region to drive Iraq's army out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, a ``rapid deployment force,'' initiated under the
Carter administration, was greatly expanded at an air base on the
Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia and on three of the first
prepositioned ships. The Rapid Deployment Force evolved into the US
Central Command, which is geared to defend the Persian Gulf just as
NATO defended Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, an armored brigade today can be moved into Kuwait
within four days, one-fifth the time it took at the start of the
decade.
</P>
<P>
   In parts of the world where ports and airfields are scarce,
however, these efforts only go so far. Another reason the Apaches
took so long to arrive in Albania was that Tirana Airport was in no
condition to receive them. The field where they were eventually
headed, near the Kosovo border, was in sorrier shape. Army
engineers had to get to the scene first to do renovations.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all these new efforts, some officers say only a
wholesale restructuring would allow the military to move quickly
enough to deal with some crises.
</P>
<P>
   Army Colonel Douglas A. Macgregor, author of the 1997 book
``Breaking the Phalanx,'' is one of the most influential of these
new military thinkers. He proposes breaking the Army's 10 divisions
into 25 or 30 combat groups. Each would be tailored to certain
missions and would stay together and train together for those
missions. He calls the group a ``smarter, smaller, faster and more
technologically advanced warfighting organization.''
</P>
<P>
   These Combat Groups are similar to the Strike Forces of the
Army's Force XXI concept, except that Macgregor recommends joint
groups, with elements from the Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marines,
working together under one command as if the separate services did
not exist.
</P>
<P>
   In the upper echelons of the military, this notion is nothing
less than revolutionary. Except for the Air Force's airlift and
Navy's sealift, whose very existence is wrapped up in carrying Army
equipment, the services always have loathed cooperating with one
another in doctrine, weapons, or anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Macgregor writes that unless they start cooperating and stop
buying redundant weapons systems, his strategy _ which requires
spending a lot more money on certain kinds of weapons and new
technologies _ would be too expensive even by hawkish standards.
</P>
<P>
   His strategy also requires some new weapons, most notably the
Armored Gun System, a tank that is much smaller, lighter, and
better-suited to cargo planes than the M-1. The Pentagon canceled
the gun system three years ago just as production was to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Macgregor _ who quotes Sun Tzu a great deal in his book _ now
runs the Joint Operations Center at NATO headquarters in Brussels
and serves as a chief aide to General Wesley K. Clark, the
commanding officer of Operation Allied Force.
</P>
<P>
   One Pentagon analyst who knows Macgregor's work said, ``He must
be having a very frustrating war.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 TORONTO: ... to checking.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I told him that if he hit first, they wouldn't be so eager to
hit him,'' says Ballantine. ``As the tournament went along, he was
almost giving them the puck so he could check them.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was 12, the Lions had become the Toronto Arrows,
a Double A youth team in the tougher Metro Toronto Hockey League.
They finished a surprising second that season, and Carter was one
of the leading scorers. By then, Ballantine was ready to send him
along to the next level.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was head and shoulders our best player by the time he
left,'' says the coach. But even then, his career ceiling seemed
limited. ``I thought he might go as far as major junior,'' says
Ballantine.
</P>
<P>
   His next year, with the Triple A Toronto Red Wings, proved a
revelation on two fronts for Carter. For one, he finally started to
get the hang of this skating thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was far from the best player on the team,'' he recalls.
``But I finished second in a skating drill one day and I thought,
`I'm not such a bad skater.' That's when it really dawned on me.''
</P>
<P>
   The other new experience was far uglier. For the first time,
Carter encountered racism. Not in Scarborough, where the fact that
he was one of a handful of black players was never an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always kid him,'' says Valma, ``that all his friends are
white.''
</P>
<P>
   But at a Christmas tournament in Guelph, an opponent from the
Detroit Little Caesars began taunting him with racial epithets.
Carter's response: ``Don't just talk, you wimp. Show it on the
ice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And Anson just dominated him in the game,'' says Valma. ``That
shut him up.''
</P>
<P>
   In college, there would be two more incidents. A Michigan player
directed racial slurs at him in one game, and one night while he
was indulging a longtime passion, surfing the Internet, a Michigan
student sent him an e-mail that said, ``Go back to your project.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter did not initially realize this was a slur; he didn't know
what a project was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither did I,'' said Valma. ``When Anson found out, he said,
`I'm going to send him back an e-mail telling him I'm not from a
project.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Valma persuaded him that he should not dignify the message with
a response.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to put it behind you,'' she told him. ``That's how
you've been raised _ you take people for how they are, not for how
they look.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter says he has encountered no such hostility since, though
he was warned to beware when he came to Boston in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at it with an open mind,'' he says of the city. ``And
the people here have been wonderful. But I'm not so naive as to
think it doesn't go on. I'm a black athlete. I don't live in a
bubble.''
</P>
<P>
   Until he joined the elite Tier II, Junior A Wexford Raiders at
17, Carter's NHL vision was still somewhat hazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just another way I could use to get a scholarship,'' he
said. ``But really, I was just having so much fun playing the game.
I'd hang out with my teammates off the ice. They were my best
friends. I loved going to tournaments where we could fool around,
almost get thrown out of hotels. I lived for the tournaments. I'd
circle the dates on the calendar.''
</P>
<P>
   But under coach Stan Butler, Carter and his parents came to the
realization that those early pipedreams were eminently reachable.
``I thought I had a good shot at the NHL,'' says Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, a Scarborough teacher-coach at the time who had seen
Carter star against his junior high teams in basketball and track
but was aware only of his raw athletic talent in hockey, was
convinced after one game in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Wexford, which was on its way to the Metro Junior Hockey League
title, was locked in a 3-3 tie against the mediocre Weston Dukes
with 10 seconds left. Butler still has the videotape of the game,
which was shown on cable. It shows Carter taking the puck at his
blue line, racing up the ice _ and being stopped by the Dukes
goalie's glove stab with two seconds left. Game? Not quite. The
puck slipped out of the glove, and with a lightning reach, Carter
poked it in with a half-second left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a basketball player following up his shot,'' says Butler
reverently. ``When I saw that play, I said, `This kid is for real.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond his athleticism, the play reinforced Carter's development
into a legitimate skating force. When Butler got his first close
look at him on blades, he nicknamed Carter Dancin' Anson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the way he skated,'' says Butler. ``It was like he
was dancing on skates. He kind of ran on the ice, almost like a
sprinter that put skates on his feet. But he was such a good
athlete that I knew if he worked on his technique, he could be a
good skater. His athletic skills and intelligence and coachability
made up for that.''
</P>
<P>
   During the year he played at decaying Scarborough Gardens Arena,
which Brad Park's father helped build and was on the other side of
town from Carter's home, Butler put him through an array of drills.
His specialty was called the Snake, a series of zigzag maneuvers
that emphasized cutting back and forth on the edges, not going full
speed ahead on the blades. By the end of the season, Carter was a
polished skater.
</P>
<P>
   ``The credit goes to him,'' says Butler. ``I had no doubts he
could make it to the NHL.''
</P>
<P>
   There were two avenues he could take. One was the traditional
Canadian route of playing major junior hockey. The other was via
college in the United States. The latter was Butler's calling card
_ 69 of his players earned college scholarships in five years, a
major reason Valma and Horace allowed their son to play for him.
</P>
<P>
   But they left the choice to Anson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played that summer against some Ontario Hockey League guys,
potential first- and second-round draft choices,'' says Carter.
``Granted, summer hockey is different, but I knew I could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But he rejected the junior option, typically after thorough
research. There were two deciding factors.
</P>
<P>
   At 140 pounds, he didn't think he could endure the rigors of the
OHL schedule. ``I wanted to use the next four years to build myself
up,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And he'd seen too many major junior players end their careers at
that level with nothing to show for it, including a degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``He determined that the educational opportunities weren't as
good in the OHL,'' says Valma. ``He'd see their players interviewed
on TV and say, `Look at that. They can't even speak the language.'
''
</P>
<P>
   ``The OHL was geared too much to hockey,'' says Carter.
``College offered a balance.''
</P>
<P>
   He found it in East Lansing.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State coach Ron Mason eagerly welcomed Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had really good skills,'' says Mason. ``I liked the way he
handled himself on the ice. And I loved the kid as a person, just
the way he came across. But you never know with any recruit how
hard he'll work, how much time he'll put in.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Mason didn't know how Carter would deal with a
demoralizing development from the previous summer. Eligible for the
NHL draft, he was selected by the Quebec Nordiques in the 10th
round, the 220th pick overall. That was a bit of a comedown for a
kid who fancied himself a premier prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was devastated,'' says Butler. But the snub did provide him
with a familiar objective. ``I wanted to prove them wrong,'' says
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   So he virtually took up residence in the weight room, bulking up
to his present 185 pounds. He got stronger on skates, tougher in
battling for the puck. He became a four-time All-American and
helped Canada win the 1994 world junior championship. After
expressing his doubts about going to the team tryouts and being
reassured by Butler that he belonged, he wound up on the first line
by the end of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anson developed,'' says Mason, ``as much as or more than any
player I'd ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   But his crusade on the ice did result in a change of plans.
Eventually, the classroom demands of medicine, especially the
chemistry load, proved a deterrent to pursuing world-class hockey.
So Carter switched his major to sociology, and while he intends to
pursue his degree, he doubts orthopedics are in his future. Other
things have come up.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't come to terms with Colorado, nee Quebec, and he
didn't get much of a look from Washington, which had acquired him
from the Rockies. But once he was obtained by Boston along with
Jason Allison and Jim Carey in the blockbuster that sent Rick
Tocchet, Bill Ranford, and Adam Oates to the Capitals on March 1,
1997, he began to find an NHL home.
</P>
<P>
   ``As limited as the chances were in Washington,'' says Carter,
``Boston gave me every opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Sinden, the Bruins' president and general manager, was
only too happy to oblige after hearing scout Gerry Cheevers tout
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got size, speed, good balance, doesn't get knocked off
the puck, and he's a fast, strong skater,'' says Sinden, unaware of
the dedication that went into that last attribute. ``He's a good
scorer and he's going to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   He already is. Despite missing 27 games because of a holdout and
an ankle injury, Carter scored 24 goals this season. In the
playoffs, he truly has begun to flourish, as evidenced by his
double-overtime goal that beat Carolina in Game 5 of Round 1 and
his insurance goal in the clincher two nights later.
</P>
<P>
   ``As he hits the net,'' says Sinden, ``then the mind gets going,
it tells you you can do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Carter has been telling himself regarding one
subject or another for more than 20 years. True, his sole focus now
is hockey and he figures that after his playing career, he'll
pursue business, perhaps in music or entertainment, rather than
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't regret it,'' he says. ``I'm thrilled the way
things turned out. I set goals early and achieved most of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he'll redirect one of them. In the meantime, he
remains devoted to his family, splitting his summers between
California and his basement bedroom in Scarborough. He e-mails
Michelle constantly. And after every game, he telephones his
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the phone rings at 1 in the morning,'' says Valma, ``we
just say, `It's got to be Anson.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the hour, Mom and Dad answer the phone. They've
learned to pay attention when the kid speaks.

OLD WARRIORS DIG IN AGAINST THE NEW WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Mention ``Boston'' to Mikhail Yudashkin, and his
thoughts go back to World War II and those terrifying sorties
against Nazi ships in the Baltic Sea.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1944, and Yudashkin would fly his Douglas A-20J bomber,
an American plane its Soviet pilots knew as ``Boston'', no higher
than the German ship's topmast, straight into deadly antiaircraft
fire.
</P>
<P>
   If a Boston pilot got lucky and got close enough, he dropped a
bomb that was supposed to skip off the water's surface and onto the
enemy ship's deck. Of 33 pilots in Yudashkin's unit, only two
survived the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very dangerous technique,'' said Yudashkin, now 73,
as his comrades nodded silently.
</P>
<P>
   As they do each May 9, Yudashkin and his buddies from the Moscow
Naval Academy Class of 1943 gathered Sunday in Gorky Park to mark
the defeat in 1945 of Nazi Germany. This is Russia's most
meaningful holiday, a day when the entire country remembers the
war's still-astonishing death toll of 27 million Soviet citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat stripped down from Soviet times, Sunday's celebration
was marked by a short military parade on Red Square and a fireworks
display. Bittersweet, sentimental war movies dominated local TV
channels and radio stations played popular wartime songs. But for
veterans the most important part of the day was the annual reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Yudashkin's class had 450 young men. Now only a handful are
left: Arkady Razumov, who faked his documents so he could fight at
age 16; Viktor Pavlov, who served on guard boats that risked Nazi
bombs to bring supplies across Lake Ladoga to besieged Leningrad;
Lev Nikolayev, the flight commander who still swears like a sailor;
Anatoly Vershinkin, who fondly remembers serving with Americans
while sailing Lend-Lease frigates from Alaska to the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   But like most Russians, Vershinkin condemns US involvement in
NATO strikes against Yugoslavia, and he was not about to let an
American reporter go without letting him know about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know Milosevic is acting badly, and we don't want to
justify him,'' Vershinkin said. ``But the Americans have started
this war that is bad for everyone. The main thing is to stop these
bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia was on everyone's mind here Sunday. Some
demonstrators protested NATO raids out of kinship for their fellow
Slavic Orthodox Christians. Some blamed Russia's current leaders
for allowing the former superpower to grow too weak to prevent NATO
from bombing. Some spoke of concern that the Balkans conflict could
spread to something not seen since 1945.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Russia is seeking to mediate the crisis with the West. Sunday,
the Balkans envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin, said that ``new, very
serious developments have emerged'' during weekend peace talks in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Yudashkin's pals had swapped war stories and paid their respects
to the deceased. The subject turned again to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we have a rotten life, but America has something to
lose,'' Razumov said. ``That makes us stronger. America should not
mess with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it was ``Boston'' pilot Yudashkin's turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell the people in America we know what war in Europe is
like,'' Yudashkin said. ``Tell them we don't want to see it
again.''

MEXICANS WARILY EYE EXPLOSIVE NEIGHBOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO XALITZINTLA, Mexico _ From the concrete front step of
the tiny corner store he has run for 30 years, Fausto Soto has a
clear view of the towering mountain that he considers both a friend
and a potential killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Afraid?'' asked Soto, 66, as his tired eyes took in the
18,000-foot peak, its shape an almost perfect cone. ``I only fear
an act of God, and if that happpens, then it happens. But I would
lose everything if that volcano erupted.''
</P>
<P>
   Most days, the first piece of news that people in this remote
hamlet get has something to do with their unstable, snow-capped
neighbor named Popocatepetl. It has been five years since the
volcano, known to all as Popo, awoke from a 75-year slumber. And
while it hasn't yet produced a major eruption _ the last one was
nearly 280 years ago _ it frequently coughs up rocks and sulfuric
ash and spreads panic as far away as Mexico City, about 40 miles to
the west. Some believe the worst is yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``The volcano has its ups and downs,'' said Cervando de la Cruz,
a volcanologist at the Geophysics Institute at Mexico's National
Autonomous University. ``In November and December last year, the
activity increased. Lately, it's been quieter, but that's not to
say that the activity is lower.''
</P>
<P>
   The volcano poses a direct threat to a half-million residents
who live in its shadow, but de la Cruz said that even in a large
eruption, nearby major cities like the capital and Puebla probably
would escape with nothing worse than showers of ash. They are far
enough away not to be imperiled by lava or mudslides.
</P>
<P>
   On its crankiest days, the volcano, whose wide skirt touches the
states of Puebla, Morelos, and Mexico, can produce as much as
800,000 tons of sulfur dioxide and set off up to 200 microtremors,
according to the National Disaster Prevention Center.
</P>
<P>
   And if one unpredictable peak wasn't enough, another volcano in
the Pacific coast state of Colima last year began belching its own
noxious mix of steam and gas.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the daily updates for the communities closest to Popo are
as simple as a flag on the roof of a local municipal building. A
green flag means all is quiet. A red one means danger and is
usually accompanied by orders from government officials to head for
safer ground.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the flags are yellow, a sign that Popo is not an
immediate threat, but the possibility of a destructive explosion
exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there probably will be another eruption, but I don't
think any of us will be around to see it,'' said Juan Merino de los
Santos, a farmer wearing a straw hat. He was sworn in last month as
the mayor of Santiago Xalitzintla, whose town square is only 10
miles from Popo's crater. ``The only alarm we have is the church
bell,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Government disaster officials have had mixed results in
developing evacuation and contingency plans in case Popo blows.
Each of the surrounding villages is marked with rectangular
green-and-white signs and an arrow directing people where to go
should lava or mudslides begin to flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have exercises and everyone knows we're supposed to go to
the next hill,'' Merino said. ``And we can only take what we can
carry.''
</P>
<P>
   But a poll last year by Mexico's Civil Protection Agency found
that 40 percent of the residents of the 12 highest-risk communities
were not familiar with evacuation routes.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency workers say designing an effective contingency plan
has been complicated by a lack of money, the remoteness of some
communities, and the challenges of training mostly poor and
uneducated residents. But perhaps the biggest challenge has been
trying to put a scientific, modern-day face on a mountain that most
people in this area worship like a god, or talk to like a loyal
companion. Many here still make regular pilgrimages to the mountain
to deliver gifts ranging from bottles of tequila to pairs of shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Like Mount Fuji in Imperial Japan, or Vesuvius in Roman-era
Italy, Popocatepetl is as much about legend and history as it is
geology. Poems, stories, and songs have been written about the
Aztec warrior who was returning from battle at last to see his
love, Iztaccihuatl.
</P>
<P>
   Before he arrived, Popo's enemies told her that he'd been killed
fighting. Distraught and unconsolable, Iztaccihuatl died from
sadness. When he learned of her death, the warrior laid Izta's body
on one mountain range, while he knelt at her side.
</P>
<P>
   In the Aztec language of Nauhuatl, Popocatepetl means ``smoking
mountain,'' and Iztaccihuatl means ``mountain of the white woman.''
The two are depicted _ as humans and mountains _ in Mexican
paintings and calendars.
</P>
<P>
   Another tale, told mostly by locals, is that the volcano is a
kind and poor man named Don Gregorio Chino, who was looking over
his wife, Dona Rosa, while she slept. But she never woke up and he
stayed with her until they turned into mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are more than volcanoes,'' said Homero Aridjis,
president of PEN, an international writers group, who is a renowned
poet and has written extensively on the two peaks. ``They've always
been seen as a romantic, mythic couple, and they've always been
present in Mexico's story.''
</P>
<P>
   It was through the gap between the mountains that the Spanish
conquistador Hernan Cortes and his troops passed on their way to
the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan, known today as Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Aridjis and others also believe that the recent volcanic
rumblings are sending an end-of-millennium message. Popo began
erupting in 1994, the year that Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo
took office and devalued the peso in an economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The country's capital, Mexico City, was once the center of Aztec
culture, with a clear view of the mountains. Today it is a densely
populated metropolis of 20 million, plagued by poverty, government
corruption, crime, and choking air pollution. Only on a rare clear
day can the mountains be seen at all from the city.
</P>
<P>
   Persistent deforestation around Popo by paper companies has
increased the chances of deadly mudslides if an eruption occurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message to the people today is that Mexico is
deteriorating and it's being sacrificed,'' Aridjis said.
</P>
<P>
   But poets aren't the only ones fixated on the volcano.
Government geologists use satellites, video cameras, and radars to
monitor its activity. There are 14 seismic monitoring stations
around the mountain and five prisms to monitor the crater.
Recently, NASA officials were called in to help.
</P>
<P>
   Volcanologists say Popo's most violent eruption happened 23,000
years ago, with a force equal to that of the Mount St. Helens blast
in Washington in 1980. Popo's last eruption with possible victims
was in 1720, according to the Disaster Prevention Center.
</P>
<P>
   Even the thought of a major eruption has been enough to scare
away some Santiago Xalitzintla families. Since Popo started moving
again five years ago, Merino estimates that the population has
fallen from about 9,000 to 6,000.
</P>
<P>
   But Juan Jimenez Castro, a 44-year-old part-time farmer who
still remembers the childhood hikes he took up the mountain with
his father, says the shakes and smoke don't scare him anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens so much now, we get used to it,'' Jimenez said.
``We can't live in fear. We just keep telling ourselves, `There
goes the Big Chief again.' ''

   WASHINGTON _ The United States is in an uncomfortable place in
the world this spring, not only because it is the planet's only
superpower, not only because there are rogue nations around the
globe brandishing terrifying arsenals, not only because
humanitarian crises beg for its attention and intervention, not
only because the world waits for its leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, the United States is in an uncomfortable position
because the nation _ so powerful, so prosperous, so secure _ is so
unsure about how to use its power outside its own borders. Even
with the emergence of a framework for settling the Kosovo crisis,
the question is still unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to decide this, and probably soon,'' says Michael
Klare, a military specialist at Hampshire College.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, Republicans and Democrats agree, we haven't decided.
We haven't even decided that we have to decide.
</P>
<P>
   For a whole decade, since the collapse of the communist bloc in
1989, the United States has stood alone at the apex of world
influence, occupying a position of power that, in this century, the
British, Germans, and Soviets all aspired to _ but never achieved.
And for much of that decade the debate over how to wield American
power _ a subject that dominated American civic life in the
Eisenhower and Kennedy years _ was little more than a theoretical
curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   It was conducted in graduate seminars and at resort conference
centers, but not on the campaign trail, not in the chambers of
Congress, not in coffee shops or Little League bleachers, and not
in the most rarefied reaches of the White House, State Department,
and Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish there were a prescription for this,'' says Brent L.
Scowcroft, the national security adviser to President George Bush,
``but there isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, of all the hard questions in Washington today _ how to
fix Social Security, whether to tinker with Medicare, when to raise
the minimum wage _ this may be the hardest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, answering that question would not have been
hard,'' says Francis M. Bator, a Harvard University professor of
political economy who was deputy national security adviser to
President Lyndon B. Johnson. ``There is no good general doctrine
with any bite that would help a president make these kinds of
decisions. Anyone who will lay one out to you is a bit of a fool.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a conundrum of consequence not only for the United States
but also for the world; a nation that spends more on defense than
the next 10 countries combined has the ability to impose its will
on the world if it wishes, to direct the attention of the world to
international crises if it likes, to mobilize world opinion if it
desires.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the failure to address this question is visible in the
large issues prompted by the Kosovo crisis, such as how to decide
whether to intervene in problems around the world. But it is also
evident in the smaller issues, such as how to prevail once American
interests are identified and American forces are engaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in a conflict, you want your enemy to be dead sure
of your objectives and completely unclear on your tactics,'' says
Richard Armitage, a defense official and foreign-policy negotiator
in the Reagan and Bush administrations. ``Right now the enemy is
unclear on the objectives, but they are dead sure of our tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   Stirred by the war in Yugoslavia, the unease with which
Americans watch the hopelessness of the ever-growing group of
refugees, the open-ended nature of the NATO military operation, and
the dwindling hopes for a swift solution to the problem, these
important questions are finally beginning to bubble to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``A democracy goes to war very sloppily, with all sorts of
different perspectives, depending much on the course of events,
depending in part on the security interests involved,'' says Morton
Abromowitz, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, top diplomatic thinkers say, the United
States should not plunge into military action without a consensus
on what American national interests are, how much sacrifice in
blood and treasure the nation is willing to make, how much
political support there is for intervention, and how much loss
public opinion will bear.
</P>
<P>
   But first a superpower like the United States must sort through
all the issues competing for its attention, establish its
priorities, and weigh them against its national interests.
</P>
<P>
   Though American policymakers have been chary of defining US
national interests, there is little disagreement that the United
States certainly has a stake in maintaining stable relations with
major powers, such as China and Russia; and probably has a stake in
addressing any aggression taken by rogue countries that can do a
lot of damage to the nation's geopolitical and economic security,
such as North Korea and Iraq; and might have a stake in events with
humanitarian consequences.
</P>
<P>
   It is the latter that is problematical and is causing problems
right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a country with values and TV sets, and we look at what
goes on in these places, we don't like it, and we want to stop
it,'' says Robert Zoellick, who was undersecretary of state in the
Bush administration. ``The difficulty is deciding how much we want
to pay in terms of lives and money to get involved.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why the crisis in Kosovo is so unsettling to American
policy makers. The human suffering is as obvious as it is
unbearable. It occurs in an area that may be of little consequence
to the United States but is nonetheless consequential to its
neighbors, including Greece, Turkey, Hungary, and Romania _ all
nations with longtime ties to the United States, emotional if not
political, and all nations whose stability is essential to the
overall stability of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people over there are suffering like hell, but lots of
people are suffering in the world,'' says James E. Auer, a
political scientist at Vanderbilt University. ``The president
apparently thought you could kind of get involved. You can't kind
of get involved. Vietnam should have told us that: You either
fight, or you do not fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Many times, the United States has decided not to fight.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s alone, deadly civil wars have raged throughout the
world, including two in the Horn of Africa, Sudan and Somalia; two
in central Africa, Rwanda and Burundi; two on the west coast of
Africa, Angola and Liberia; and two in Eurasia, Yugoslavia and
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Besides an intervention in Haiti, close to American shores and
American hearts, and a brief and uncomfortable foray into Somalia,
the United States has decided to intervene only in the former
Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Five years later, US
forces remain in Haiti; four years later, in Bosnia. All signs
point to an eventual long-term US presence, probably a peacekeeping
role, in Kosovo once a peace agreement is reached and ratified.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda, where at least a half-million people perished, has
provoked guilt in the American conscience, and Clinton went so far
as to apologize to the Rwandan people.

WHEN WAR WAS DESTINY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid a sudden, confusing war, an editorial in The Boston Globe
on June 18, 1898, noted the noisy swapping of plumage among hawks
and doves of the time, much like the cacophony in today's political
aviary:
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus, by the irony of fate, a war which the Democrats forced
upon the Republicans has in its progress compelled the two parties
to make an exchange of positions, the radicals of two months ago
becoming the conservatives today, while the conservatives then are
the radicals now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meanwhile, the American people as a whole are astraddle the
fence of doubt, whittling the stick of silent reflection. In other
and plainer words, for once they are stumped! Even Boston, which is
the greatest compounder of solutions for all problems that vex the
minds alike of the finite and the infinite, discovered when its
wisdom was assembled in Faneuil Hall on Wednesday that there was no
complete solvent ready made for this most novel and unforeseen
occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Globe referrred to the Anti-Imperialist League's first
meeting, in Faneuil Hall, on June 15, four months after the USS
Maine exploded in Havana harbor. Presiding was George Boutwell,
former US senator and former secretary of the treasury. Notables
from the Boston bar and the Harvard faculty sought to halt the war
fever sweeping America.
</P>
<P>
   The league's principles, opposing American annexation of former
Spanish colonies, attracted former president Grover Cleveland;
philosopher William James; novelists William Dean Howells and Mark
Twain; and, in an unlikely pairing, labor leader Samuel Gompers and
industrialist Andrew Carnegie, who sent Gompers a telegram saying,
``Let us stand together to save the Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuba and Puerto Rico were close to America, but the Philippines,
distant and exotic, seemed a greater prize. The Anti-Imperialists,
wrote Barbara W. Tuchman in ``The Proud Tower,'' ``were attempting
to hold their country back from plucking the archipelago in the
Pacific, which seemed to glow with the fatal evil of the apple in
the Garden of Eden.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, Finley Peter Dunne's fictional bartender, ``Mr.
Dooley,'' chided his customer, Mr. Hennessy, who said, ``I'd hist a
flag over th' Phlippeens, an' I'd take in th' whole lot iv thim.''
</P>
<P>
   ``An' yet,'' said Mr. Dooley, ``tis not more thin two months
since ye larned whether they were islands or canned goods.''
</P>
<P>
   The war began at the urging of ``the yellow press'' and the
recitation of Spanish atrocities, real and imagined, filled
American newspapers. American naval and military might crushed
Spain's empire in a few months. President McKinley, reluctant at
first, said acquiring new colonies, including Hawaii, ``is Manifest
Destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, the Globe addressed ``the inner circles of the
professed advocates of peace'' and concluded: ``The one and only
way to secure a speedy and honorable peace lies through a vigorous
prosecution of the war.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State John Hay called it ``a splendid little war,''
but every war has unintended consequences. In the Philippines, US
troops took three years to suppress rebels led by Emilio Aguinaldo,
who believed that the Americans came to liberate, not conquer,
those whom the new military governor, William Howard Taft, called
our ``little brown brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1898, the mood was expansionist, even imperial. Today,
humanitarian motives ignite the explosives of war and reverberate
with similar instincts of self-admiration. The Boston Globe was the
first newspaper to syndicate Chicago's Dunne, whose ``Mr. Dooley''
predicted quick victory in Cuba: ``Morro Castle'll cave in, and th'
air 'll be full iv Spanish whiskers. A long blow, a sthrong blow,
an' a blow all together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a gr-reat people,'' said Mr. Hennessy, earnestly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ar-re,'' said Mr. Dooley. ``We ar-re that. An' the best iv
it is, we know we ar-re.''

MEEHAN'S MISSION IS HONEST POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ At the last count, there were 191 members of the
House of Representatives all committed on paper to forcing campaign
finance reform legislation onto the floor for that simple act the
moneyed interests fear most _ a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the cause, every one is a Democrat (not
counting Vermont independent Bernie Sanders), which means that once
again where a major issue is concerned, one key to the outcome will
be how certain kinds of Democrats and certain kinds of Republicans
deal with each other. And in this case, that means the largest
share of the work across the aisle will have to be done by
Representative Marty Meehan of Massachusetts, Democratic chief
sponsor of reform and ally of the Republican chief sponsor, Chris
Shays of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   It is tough, grinding work, building a case for a member of the
other party to take a position against his leadership on an issue
that concerns the very business of getting elected. In this
situation, Meehan needs to find 26 GOP members.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, Meehan is likely to find the GOP allies his
cause requires _ either for a petition forcing a vote or for
persuading the GOP leadership to allow one, rather than be forced
to. One reason he's likely to be successful is that he's been
successful before (last year 61 Republicans in the House made the
Shays-Meehan legislation legitimately bipartisan).
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, as campaign finance reform was beginning to
come to a head in the House last week, Meehan at last got off his
duff and quietly announced _ via a letter sent to every household
in his district _ that he is in fact running for a fifth term next
year.
</P>
<P>
   No big deal under normal circumstances, except that Meehan is
the only Democrat trapped by a pledge made years earlier in support
of the moribund term-limits movement. For a spell early in his
career here, he did talk some of the talk and walked some of the
walk, though he has never resembled the fanatics who came along two
years later as part of Newt Gingrich's revolution-that-wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, what he has done as a congressman belies his earlier
stance and underlines the overriding need for veterans here in an
era when problem-solving has eclipsed crusading as the major job
requirement. Seniority per se is not the point; mere length of
service doesn't count for much anymore, but what does is the
ability to work across the aisle at a time when no matter which
party is in the majority, its margin is not going to be large
enough to govern without the other party's help and therefore input
on major issues.
</P>
<P>
   That's true about all the big entitlement programs from Social
Security to Medicare; it's true about regulating HMOs; it's true
about the next step in the tobacco wars; and it has always been
true about campaign finance reform in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan, in fact, was a part of the realistic efforts to effect
change from almost the beginning. After Bill Clinton's election in
1992, the stalemate on this issue was framed not just by
conservative intransigence on behalf of the big-money status quo
but also by liberal Democratic proposals to regulate federal
elections in excruciating detail and to introduce public financing.
The only hope for bipartisanship was to focus on eliminating the
most egregious abuses _ above all, the unregulated cash called soft
money and the phony ``issue'' ads that special interests finance.
</P>
<P>
   Those ideas remain at the core of the Shays-Meehan legislation
in the House and of the counterpart being pushed in the Senate by
Republican John McCain of Arizona and Democrat Russ Feingold of
Wisconsin. The Republicans Meehan will recruit to help put the heat
on Speaker Denny Hestert to schedule a vote can trust him to keep
the Democrats' end of the bargain.
</P>
<P>
   When Meehan ran in '92, it was the time not only of Bill
Clinton's moderating influence on the Democratic Party, but of Ross
Perot's healthy bucket of cold water on traditional politics.
Before Perot undercut his own movement via personal antics, it had
made several major contributions to the political atmosphere with
its emphasis on sane budget policy, problem-solving, and clean
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Term limits were in the mix back then, but over time that hot
button's temperature has cooled, for all the right reasons. Ability
is what counts, which is why decisions by people like Meehan to
stick around will be welcomed far more than condemned.

 WASHINGTON: ... Rwandan people.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The question is where you can make a positive difference,''
says Michael E. O'Hanlon, a fellow in foreign-policy studies at the
Brookings Institution, the Washington think tank. ``You can
eliminate a few easily; it would have been insanity to risk a
wide-scale war by getting involved in something so important to the
Russians as Chechnya. In some of these civil wars, you couldn't
even figure out what to do once you intervened.''
</P>
<P>
   These problems seldom affected earlier generations of Americans.
Presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson warned Americans
to avoid entangling alliances. Both warned Americans to remain free
of foreign disputes, a notion that was brought home to Jefferson in
the breach as he was dragged deeper into the Napoleonic wars that
engulfed the continent of Europe in the first decade of the 19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, however, Americans tended to their own knitting. The
United States stayed out of the Crimean War, resisted entry into
World War I until the last year of combat, was essentially a
bystander during the Spanish Civil War, and desperately tried to
avoid World War II. The United States joined the latter conflict
more than two years after it began, and then only when it became
impossible to stay out _ even though humanitarian factors not
unlike those in Yugoslavia might have provided an adequate reason
to fight.
</P>
<P>
   That all changed when the war ended, leaving Germany and Japan
all but destroyed as world military powers, the British Empire
fatally weakened, and China in turmoil. More important still, the
end of the war also left the Soviet Union empowered by its
territorial grabs in Eastern Europe and its expansionist ideology
and the United States strengthened by the economic leaps that
wartime mobilization brought to the only major combatant whose home
territory escaped damage.
</P>
<P>
   Then, despite a small remnant of isolationism, the United States
swiftly acquired a broad international role, with broad
international responsibilities. The globe was convulsed in an
ideological struggle, with capitalism and the United States
battling communism and the Soviet Union (and, after 1949, China).
Small wars were fought for big stakes in Korea, Vietnam, Central
America, the Caribbean, and central Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But the end of the Cold War in 1989 brought an end to these
regional brush fires stoked by global ideology. It ended the
artificial stability imposed on regional and ethnic warriors by the
two superpowers. It also ended the ease with which, for a brief
window in our national history, the United States decided whether
to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've historically had this problem, but it's even worse now
because of the deep ambivalence in Washington over whether the
United States should use the power it has, a power that is
indisputably the greatest power in the world,'' says Klare, the
Hampshire College specialist in military affairs. ``American
leaders, both Democrats and Republicans, are having trouble making
those decisions _ and are even having trouble deciding what is an
American interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Bator, the former Johnson adviser, believes Kosovo may offer
some hints about how to think about these questions. ``Foreign
policy has to deal with trying to use whatever influence we have to
create an environment where the United States can continue to
thrive as a disorganized, messy, decentralized, open society,'' he
says. ``That is the fundamental national interest. So this is more
than a humanitarian question. We have a stake in a decent world
order, just as the rich man with a big house on the hill has a
stake in the surrounding countryside being pretty peaceful.''
</P>
<P>
   But determining American interests is only the beginning, most
specialists agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a problem that's getting worse, you look at the
tools you have, all the way from diplomacy to the use of force,''
says Scowcroft, the Bush-era national security adviser. ``If it
comes to the possibility of force, you need to figure out whether
it will do the job. But you have to ask: How much will it take? How
much will it cost? And can you sustain the support of the American
people for doing it?
</P>
<P>
   ``And if the answers all are `yes,' he continues, ``you still
have to ask whether you can get the Americans out when it's over.
There aren't many places where the answers to all those things are
`yes.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders of both parties agree that President Clinton
has offered a rationale for US intervention in Kosovo, but no road
map for deciding whether to intervene elsewhere. Indeed, most of
his comments have been very narrowly drawn.
</P>
<P>
   To the convention of the American Federation of State, County
and Municipal Employees on March 23, he said: ``So what do we learn
from Bosnia? We learned that if you don't stand up to brutality and
the killing of innocent people, you invite the people who do it to
do more of it. We learned that firmness can save lives and stop
armies.''
</P>
<P>
   To the American Society of Newspaper Editors on April 15 he
expanded his explanation somewhat: ``We are in Kosovo because we
care about saving lives and we care about the character of the
multiethnic post-Cold-War world. We don't want young democracies
that have made the right choices to be overwhelmed by the flight of
refugees and the victories of ethnic hatred. We don't want to see
Europe re-fight with tanks and artillery the same battles they
fought centuries ago with axes and arrows. And because stability in
Europe is important to our own security, we want to build a Europe
that is peaceful, undivided, and free, a Europe where young
Americans do not have to fight and die again to deal with the
consequences of other people's madness and greed.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now Americans are fighting but not dying in Eastern
European combat, conducting an antiseptic air war that offers
Americans limited exposure to risk but also offers NATO limited
potential for success. The reason is admirable but constricting:
Clinton and his advisers will brook no large-scale American
casualties, a strategy that is derided by some of his critics but
is supported by decades of poll data.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively low number of civilian deaths seems to have kept
American concerns to a minimum over the broader costs of the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, neither the president nor the Republicans who are
eager to succeed him have engaged in a larger debate over why, and
how, the United States might get involved in world problems in this
difficult new era of American leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two questions,'' says Senator John F. Kerry, the
Massachusetts Democrat who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee. ``How should we decide? And how have we decided? At the
very least, we need very large interests at stake and a significant
amount of diplomatic effort that is finally exhausted, along with
defining the effort and educating the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the moment, we haven't gone to war,'' Kerry adds. ``That's
the anomaly. The country in no way feels it is at war, and there's
no impact here, other than budgetary, that might suggest we are at
war.''

SAVING FOR RETIREMENT AND KIDS' EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I are both 43 and we plan on retiring at age 58.
We also intend to help our daughters, aged 10 and 5, with their
college expenses. Currently my wife and her employer contribute
$7,000 a year to a 401(k) account which now amounts to $135,000. It
is invested in these Vanguard funds: 10 percent each in a money
market fund and an investment contract, 20 percent each in Index
500, Windsor II, and International Growth. I am a teacher, and at
retirement I will receive benefits representing 70 to 80 percent of
my average salary for my final three years. I also contribute
$1,100 a year to a 403(b) account, which now stands at $46,000. Of
this, $35,000 is in Fidelity Growth and Income fund and $5,500 each
is in Fidelity Equity Income I and Fidelity Equity Income II. All
of my current contributions go into the Growth and Income fund. We
also contribute $350 quarterly to our older daughter's college fund
and $250 quarterly to our younger daughters fund. Both accounts are
in Fidelity Growth and Income, and each stands at $6,500. Finally,
the older child has $9,000 invested in Janus fund. Do you feel we
have allocated the money correctly? I attach a list of the options
for my wife's 401(k). We are considering increasing my wife's
contribution to the 401(k). Should we contribute more to the
children's funds instead?
</P>
<P>
   K.K., East Longmeadow, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, it seems to me that you have established very little
real diversification, even though you're using a number of funds.
With the exception of your international fund and the two
fixed-income funds, virtually all of your savings are focused on
large-cap stocks.
</P>
<P>
   I would make two suggestions for your 401(k). The first is to
swap one of the three large-cap funds (Index 500, Windsor II and
U.S. Growth) for Vanguard Explorer fund, which holds a small-cap
portfolio. Second, I suggest you rethink the 20 percent of the
401(k) portfolio which is split between the money market and
savings trust accounts. If you insist on having a conservative base
for the portfolio, I would suggest that money go into Vanguard
Wellington, where roughly a third of the portfolio is invested in
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   You don't spell out the options that are available within your
husband's 403(b) program, but I'd seek similar diversification
there _ an ideal makeup might be 50 or 60 percent large cap
(represented by the three funds he now owns) and the balance
divided equally among a mid-cap, a small-cap, and international,
and (in a perfect world) a health care sector fund.
</P>
<P>
   My tally shows that with your ongoing contributions, your 401(k)
program will grow to $717,410 in the course of 14 years, a tally
which presumes average annual portfolio growth of 10 percent. Under
the same assumptions and with ongoing contributions at the same
level, your husband's 403(b) account would reach $206,857 in the
same period.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this, combined with your husband's pension, is likely to
be sufficient for your retirement is a determination you'll have to
make for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   As for the children's accounts, you've probably worked these
calculations out before, since the answers show you'd have fairly
similar amounts saved for each child by age 17.
</P>
<P>
   Again assuming average 10 percent returns, the 10-year-old would
have $44,091 in the combined Fidelity and Janus accounts at age 17,
while the five-year-old's account would grow to $42,757 by the time
she is 17. Whether this is enough depends on two factors _ one is
whether the children attend public or private schools, and the
other is what you mean by the word ``help.'' The current edition of
``Paying for College Without Going Broke'' by Kalman A. Chaney and
Geoff Martz projects average college costs in the year 2006 at
$11,591 for a public school and $29,808 for a public school. For
the younger child, presumed to be ready for college in the year
2011, the projected bill would be $14,793 for a public college and
$38,043 for the average private school.
</P>
<P>
   So if by helping you basically mean paying the bill, you'll
probably need to save a lot more for both if they go to private
schools; if they will likely go to public schools, you'll need to
save a little more for the older child and quite a bit more for the
younger.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, I hope you have been maintaining these educational
accounts in your own name; the accumulation of significant assets
in the student's name sharply reduces her prospects of winning
financial aid packages. If you have been saving in the children's
names, I suggest you immediate stop contributing to the accounts
and put all further savings in your own names.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You frequently refer to Vanguard's and Fidelity's funds, but
I rarely see references to those of the Janus fund family. I check
in the (papers periodically, and I find Janus funds seem to do as
well or better than the funds at Fidelity. What am I missing? My
wife has about $100,000 to invest. We have a number of other
investments in various categories as well. as well. What do you
suggest?
</P>
<P>
   B.M., San Diego &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You aren't missing anything. Janus is a fine fund family, and
if I write about it less than its larger peers, it's simply because
many of my correspondents have established relationships with the
bigger companies. If I were to select an all-purpose portfolio
among Janus' funds (there is, of course, no such thing) I'd put 50
percent in either Janus fund or Janus Growth and Income, 20 percent
in Janus Overseas, 15 percent in Janus Venture, and 15 percent in
Janus Balanced. All of these funds get four- or five-star ratings
from Morningstar Mutual Funds, with the exception of Janus Venture,
whose three-star rating reflects the generally dismal small-cap
growth sector in recent years, rather than a poor performance
relative to its peers.

GRASS-ROOTS IDEA YIELDS SCHOLARSHIPS FOR STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ How many times a month or a week do you feel
your heart sink at the hopelessness of it all? Need. Pain.
Inequity. Everywhere. Where do you start? What can one person do?
Especially if a person is not Bill Gates?
</P>
<P>
   Henry Safrit, a San Francisco endocrinologist, has an answer.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago _ before they could think about it too long _ he
convinced four of his friends to engage in some radical but
practical philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   Each pledged $500 a year for four years and turned the money
into a $10,000, four-year college scholarship to be awarded to a
senior at a public high school in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The following year Safrit button-holed more friends, and five
more $10,000 scholarships were awarded. The year after that, there
was enough money for nine. This year, after reviewing more than 100
applications, the advisory board for the Meritus College Fund will
present a dozen $10,000 scholarships to financially needy students
in San Francisco public high schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's philanthropy at an affordable level,'' said Carl Berry,
whose wife is one of the original Safrit Five. ``And the best part
is, you get involved with the life of your scholar. It can be
anything from having them to dinner to providing summer employment.
But it's much more than writing a check.''
</P>
<P>
   Nestor Navidad, a San Francisco State University sophomore, is
representative of the Meritus winners. His mother, a 34-year-old
Salvadoran immigrant, supports her two children by baby-sitting and
house cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   Navidad's energy and 3.5 grade point average convinced his
teachers and a counselor at Galileo High to urge him to check out
college.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I wasn't sure I would make it because of all the money you
have to pay,'' he said. ``My mom can't possibly pay for college for
my sister and me.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many academic awards and scholarships, Meritus is not a
one-shot deal. It's $2,500 a year for four years, so long as
students keep their grades healthy. The kids get every cent that is
given because all administrative costs are donated.
</P>
<P>
   Safrit, a native of North Carolina native and a graduate of Duke
University, had grown frustrated over the years with
bureaucracy-heavy endowment giving ``where they take the interest
out each year and a little of the money trickles down to the
scholar.'' After several years on the board of a youth center, he
thought: ``Why not figure out a way to help needy kids who want
help?''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Berry's wife, Linden, then a counselor at Washington High
School, helped find the student pool that produced the first
winner. Now scholars from all San Francisco high schools can apply.
</P>
<P>
   To give the group tax-exempt status _ yes, donations are tax
deductible _ a lawyer did the legal work pro bono. There is a
four-person interview panel.
</P>
<P>
   Safrit's home doubles as the fund's business office. Scholar-
winners help out with paper work and the Wells Fargo bank has
kicked in $5,000 this year for administrative costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``By and large, everyone involved is a middle-class working Joe
who has an interest in education and wants to make a difference,''
Carl Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing proprietary about what we do,'' Berry said.
``Anybody who wants to get five people together _ or however they
configure it _ is welcome to join us. We'd like to raise more money
and have more kids apply.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, unlike most other scholarships, Meritus is looking not
for the students with perfect 4.0 grade averages, but for those
with 3.5s or even 3.2s _ children who show promise and a
willingness to work. Reflecting the population of San Francisco's
public schools, most of the scholars are minority students, and
many are the first members of their family to attend college.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids are mesmerizing,'' Safrit said. ``They're so much fun
to be with. Most of them have had so little in their lives _ many
of them are from immigrant families _ yet, in spite of all these
roadblocks, they overcome them. We (the donors) probably get more
joy out of it than the students do.''
</P>
<P>

STEELE CASE UNDERSCORES TRUE STARR MOTIVE: VENGEANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The mistrial in the Julie Hiatt Steele case underscores the
misguided motives behind Kenneth W. Starr's investigation of
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel indicted Steele because she did not
cooperate with him during his $40 million failed quest to ``get
Clinton.'' She was the first and only person in the White House sex
scandal to be indicted by Starr. And now a deadlocked jury has
refused to back up his charges in a case that never should have
been brought.
</P>
<P>
   According to Starr and his colleagues, Steele was indicted for
lying and obstructing Starr's investigation of Clinton when she
refused to corroborate Kathleen Willey's charge that Clinton made
unwanted sexual advances to her, including groping and kissing her.
</P>
<P>
   As the story goes, Willey told Steele of the president's
behavior. Willey also told her story to Newsweek, and the magazine
in turn called Steele to corroborate the story, which she did. But
Steele later called Newsweek and asked that it not publish the
story because Willey had asked her to lie to the reporter. She said
Willey's account of Clinton's unwanted advances was not true after
all.
</P>
<P>
   With Steele recanting her story to Newsweek, Starr was left
without a corroborating witness to Willey's story, which she
broadcast in her appearance on CBS-TV's ``60 Minutes.'' Shortly
after that, Willey's credibility began to crumble when stories
about earlier lies and her continued efforts to be close to Clinton
were published.
</P>
<P>
   Even in cross-examination at the Steele trial, Willey, with the
facts confronting her, was forced to acknowledge discrepancies
between the statements she gave to Paula Jones's lawyers in Jones's
lawsuit against Clinton, and the statements she later gave to
Starr's investigators.
</P>
<P>
   In her 1998 deposition in the Jones case, Willey couldn't
remember where the president groped her or put his hands, or even
if he kissed her. According to one report, Willey said ``I don't
recall'' 63 times during the deposition.
</P>
<P>
   At the trial, she seemed to remember in detail everything about
the event, including where the president put his hands and that he
kissed her. One of those accounts had to be untruthful.
</P>
<P>
   Insteading of indicting Willey for lying, and even after it was
clear she lied about her relationship to another man, Starr gave
her further immunity. Even Linda Tripp reportedly gave a different
version of what Willey told her about the events and what Willey
had told prosecutors. That means either Tripp or Willey had to be
lying, but neither was indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Steele, however, was indicted, and the only reason apparent is
that she ruined Starr's chances of making Willey's charge of
unwanted sexual advances stick against the president. Thus, his
desire to ``get Steele'' by indicting her for obstructing justice
and lying to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration of a mistrial helps to demonstrate that Starr's
indictment of Steele is simply another example of his blatant abuse
of the power of his office.
</P>
<P>
   With the impeachment trial over, with a federal judge making a
final statement by holding Clinton in contempt for lying during the
Paula Jones case, and with the news media now focused on Kosovo and
Belgrade, the Steele case appears to have been not only unnecessary
but also a complete waste of taxpayer money _ yet on Friday,
Starr's prosecutors said they were weighing whether to seek a
retrial. Then again, a prudent use of taxpayer money was never high
on Starr's agenda; getting Clinton, by almost any means, was.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Starr must be seen as the big loser in this case. As
for Steele, it may be some consolation to her that she will come
out of this looking a lot better in the public eye than Starr, who
will now look only worse.
</P>
<P>
   And if any legislator had any doubt as to whether the
independent counsel law should end, never to rise again, all he or
she has to do is to review the Steele case and see all the
vindictiveness, mean-spiritedness, and abuse that Starr has heaped
upon her simply because she would not do his bidding.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's reputation will be permanently tarnished; he walks away
with guilt, or should, knowing that he destroyed or harmed the
lives of many people who got in his way during his relentless
pursuit of the president.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to think that someday Steele and other victims
of Starr's investigation might finally see him come to justice. But
for it to be truly appropriate justice, one of his victims would
have to exercise the same vindictive power over him that he has
wielded over them. And to find one who could be just like Starr
would be virtually impossible.

SMALL-TOWN BEGINNING INFORMS BRADLEY'S QUEST  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRYSTAL CITY, Mo. _ This is the one-stoplight town by the
Mississippi River that Bill Bradley left for greater glory, for
stardom on the New York Knicks, for 18 years as a US senator, and
for his greatest dream of all, to become president of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   But now that Bradley is the lone Democratic opponent of Vice
President Al Gore, with his fortunes rapidly rising or falling
depending on which poll is read, the former New Jersey senator
finds the rationale for his race in this humble place. Look no
farther than the former site of the nation's largest flat-glass
factory, which once employed most of the townspeople, a few blocks
from his childhood home. Today, nothing is left of the 240-acre
complex except some concrete slabs and the glass workers' union
hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like pictures removed from a family album,'' Bradley
says, offering the factory shutdown as a metaphor for how even the
smallest town is affected by economic change, a central theme of
his campaign. Similarly, he says his views on racial justice were
formed by the town's diverse work force _ not only by his years as
a professional basketball player.
</P>
<P>
   It is common, of course, for politicians to emphasize small-town
roots, and clearly there is a calculation to Bradley's focus on
Crystal City. After all, stories of his upbringing in a small
Midwestern town resonate far better in rural Iowa _ the crucial
first-caucus state _ than tales of his later years in New York and
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley, set to begin a three-day campaign swing through New
Hampshire this week, says voters cannot understand why he is
running for president until they grasp how his vision is shaped by
the demise of the factory and by the dreams he nourished as a boy
in this town of 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a small town that impeded his growth,'' said Dick
Cook, one of Bradley's best friends here. ``It was his growth.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An important chapter &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet even though Bradley, as celebrity athlete and politician,
has lived so much of his life in the public eye, the Crystal City
story remains a little-known chapter of his life, even though it
might be the most important.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think I am, a peeled onion?'' a bemused Bradley
said, as he reminisced about Crystal City during a recent interview
in his New Jersey campaign headquarters. ``I got a few layers
left.''
</P>
<P>
   The layers begin to unfold 36 miles south of St. Louis, in what
appears to be an idyllic setting on the banks of the Mississippi.
In a square-block area sits the old Bradley home, where a sign
still bears his father's name, W.W. Bradley, and a basketball court
takes up most of the backyard. Around the corner is the bank that
for years was run by his father, a cautious man who was famous for
never foreclosing on a house during the Depression. Across the
street is the elegant stone Grace Presbyterian Church, where Sunday
school was taught by Bradley's mother, Susan, who counseled young
Bill to take worthwhile risks. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A blend of philosophies &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's run for the presidency can be viewed as being fueled
by a blend of his parents' philosophies. He decided not to run for
the White House in 1992, when many thought he had his best chance.
Now that he is running, he is doing so in a nothing-to-lose manner,
eschewing advice from political experts who want him to cobble
together support from enough special-interest groups to win.
Bradley mocks such ideas, especially the widely discussed theory
that support from blacks and labor unions might be the key to
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the 6-foot-5 Bradley is reaching for what he calls the
``idealism'' vote. He brims with confidence that people will view
him as the best candidate when they hear him speak.
</P>
<P>
   Such talk would sound naive from most candidates. Running for
president, after all, tends to put a premium on hardball tactics.
But Bradley, who took to the Senate floor in 1995 to declare that
the political system was ``broken,'' says he has no interest in a
traditional campaign. He insists he can ``see my way to 270'' _ the
number of electoral votes needed to become president _ without
pandering to traditional constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   But his idealism does not ignore reality. He wrote a paper while
attending Crystal City High on ``Money is Power,'' focusing on Mark
Hanna, the financial wizard of William McKinley's presidential
victory in 1896. Bradley, in his autobiography, ``Time Present,
Time Past,'' describes how Hanna ``could meld money and
organization into an unbeatable political machine,'' and directed
McKinley to remain above the fray and ``occasionally issue a
carefully worded public speech.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Hanna doctrine'' permeates the Bradley campaign today.
Bradley rebuffs most requests for television interviews, preferring
to focus on his fund-raising and delivering broadly worded speeches
that are notably short on specifics. He surprised many by raising
$4.3 million in the first quarter of this year. Although that is
less than half of Gore's total, it demonstrated that Bradley could
make good on his pledge to collect $25 million this year, more than
enough to keep him financially competitive through the early
primaries. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He is unclear on issues &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, his stands on many issues are difficult to distinguish
from Gore's. He often comes across as even more wooden and prone to
intellectualism than the vice president. When pressed on a variety
of issues in an interview, Bradley demurs.
</P>
<P>
   On Kosovo, for example, Bradley has been highly critical of the
administration, saying President Clinton and Gore should have
foreseen what was developing in Yugoslavia and tried to prevent it.
Asked whether he is for the NATO bombing, Bradley does not answer
directly. ``There could have been more fruitful negotiations, quite
frankly,'' he says. Pressed again, he answers, ``I'm not going to
get into the micromanagement of the day-to-day actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley says the most important issue facing the country is race
relations. He says he backed the Clinton administration's effort to
``mend, not end'' affirmative action. Still, Bradley says he can do
better by ``not being afraid to talk about the subject, willing to
make yourself vulnerable on the subject, willing to make yourself
misunderstood by all sides.''
</P>
<P>
   This view is consistent with Bradley's upbringing in Crystal
City. The town was filled with diverse groups of people, and the
rich and poor rarely lived more than a block apart.
</P>
<P>
   For years Crystal City was the ultimate factory town. It was
built by Pittsburgh Plate Glass, which was attracted by the area's
silica sand, vital to the glass-making process. At its height, the
massive factory employed 4,500. The company paid for the lights,
the sewers, the streets. This benefited Bradley's father, William
Warren Bradley, the banker who overcame a disability that made it
difficult for him to walk or do other physical activities. Bill
Bradley, an only child, lived comfortably but not ostentatiously in
a neat, brick-faced bungalow.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Bradley was in high school in the late 1950s,
attracting national attention for his basketball skills, the town
was in crisis. The factory workers went on strike, and the shutdown
of machinery sent an eerie quiet through town. ``The town always
had a hum to it,'' said Bradley's aunt, Hardeman Bond, who still
lives here. ``I never noticed it till there was a strike.''
</P>
<P>
   After many ups and downs, the plant was shut in 1992 and
demolished. Today, about 350 acres adjacent to the factory site are
owned by a familiar figure: Bill Bradley. While Bradley uses the
property for farmland _ a fact he frequently mentions in Iowa _ the
land is often flooded and the real value seems sentimental. He says
it shows he will always be part of Crystal City, although some
townspeople say his visits are infrequent. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A small-town vision &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Bradley runs for president, the imagery of his Crystal
City years permeates his campaign. When Bradley talks about helping
those in poverty, he refers to his father's actions during the
Depression. When he talks about how he can beat Gore, he recalls
working harder here at basketball than anyone else, making jump
shots in his backyard until he dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's main criticism of Gore is that the vice president's
proposals are too small. Bradley says, for instance, that Gore
wants to allow a tax credit of up to $260 for those who help a
relative with disabilities. But a Gore aide said Bradley's charge
is unfair because the the tax credit is $1,000 and is part of a
larger health-care initiative.
</P>
<P>
   For many Americans just tuning into the presidential campaign,
Bradley's run might seem quixotic. A number of leading Democrats,
including Senator John F. Kerry, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska,
and House minority leader Richard Gephardt, bowed out partly
because they viewed Gore as unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   But if Gore stumbles, Bradley is the only current alternative
for the Democratic nomination. If the war in Kosovo drags on, and
the NATO intervention grows unpopular, Bradley would be relatively
untainted. The scenarios might seem far-fetched, but they are far
more probable than they seemed a few months ago, when a number of
Democratic challengers seemed likely and could dilute the anti-Gore
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how he could miss,'' said Bond. As if confiding a
family secret, she said Bradley's goal always has been the
presidency. ``The idea germinated when he was quite young, and he
has pursued opportunities to do it,'' she said. ``This has been a
part of his psyche from a long time ago.''

AMA IN DANGER OF VANISHING FROM THE SCENE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ When thousands of doctors converge here in June for
the American Medical Association's annual meeting, it will likely
be the most harmonious gathering of its kind in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Not because the AMA has won over its critics. There are more of
them than ever and they're madder than ever _ over everything from
the firing of Dr. George Lundberg, the AMA journal's top editor _
to a series of more recent troubles and firings. But that anger has
made many simply give up on the AMA, canceling plans to attend the
annual meeting, or, if they go, deciding it will be futile to raise
a challenge. All of which threatens the once-omnipotent doctors'
lobby with irrelevancy, the one fate it fears more than its current
controversies.
</P>
<P>
   And unless it can somehow reinvigorate itself, it'll be more
than doctors who have lost a voice. At a time when health care is
resurfacing as perhaps the most contentious issue in the country,
patients, too, will be without a potentially potent advocate
against limits imposed by managed care, Medicare cuts, and other
moves to retrenchment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who would be willing to criticize and stand up are just
drifting away. Doctors are saying this whole thing is just
irrelevant,'' worries Dr. Raymond Scalettar, a former AMA chairman
who has led reformers in unsuccessful bids to overhaul the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to Europe instead of to the annual meeting. It's the
first meeting I'll miss in 25 years . . . but it's the only message
I can send.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tom Delbanco, a Harvard Medical School professor who edits a
monthly column in the Journal of the American Medical Association,
is sounding a similar alarm: ``One would hope that a loud voice
from the doctor would represent the public interest rather than
purely self interests. I have so little faith in the AMA being that
way with its current configuration that I'm embarrassed by their
pretending to speak for doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Randolph Smoak, the current AMA chairman, is much more
upbeat. ``I believe our organization is working well,'' he says.
``Like any others, there always will be a few little glitches, but
you have to look at how strong we are. We have a wonderful
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the media tends to concentrate on the negative and I
think that is unfortunate, in my view. I hate to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult not to zero in on the negative given what's been
happening recently at the nation's biggest organization of doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Start with membership numbers. The AMA today represents about 35
percent of America's physicians _ down from 90 percent in the 1950s
and 50 percent in 1975. The erosion has continued, albeit more
slowly, over the last five years, and there is speculation that
when the newest numbers are out they will show a further decline,
probably inspired by the firing of Lundberg as editor of the
Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors around the country, especially younger ones, simply
don't think the AMA is relevant to their practices or their
patients, and they don't want to spend the $400 or so a year it
costs to be a member. Others are joining societies representing
their speciality, say dermatology, and feel that such groups offer
more than the AMA in scientific and political guidance.
</P>
<P>
   What the specialized groups don't offer is a broad-based
direction for the nation on such pressing issues as insuring the 44
million Americans without health coverage, restructuring Medicare,
and ensuring that managed care doesn't ride roughshod over
patients. These are the sorts of practical and ethical challenges
that a general medical society like the AMA historically has
addressed here, although it generally has seemed more concerned
with the interests of doctors than patients. And they're the sorts
of broad-based challenges that medical societies still devote major
attention to in other Western nations.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last several years, however, the AMA has had to focus a
disproportionate amount of energy on internal controversies,
leaving its senior staff with less time and fewer resources to
devote to broader social issues.
</P>
<P>
   First there was the deal, unveiled in 1997, in which the AMA
would have received millions of dollars for endorsing humidifiers,
blood-pressure monitors, and other products made by Sunbeam Corp.
The plan was dropped after AMA members questioned the ethics of the
agreement, but the executive vice president had to resign, Sunbeam
sued and settled for nearly $10 million, and a recent independent
report accused AMA trustees of failing to properly police the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the firing, in January, of JAMA editor Lundberg,
who over 17 years had built the journal into one of the world's
most respected medical publications. The AMA said Lundberg had
stepped over the line by running an article that touched on
presidential sex and impeachment politics, but critics around the
world accused the association of improperly interfering in
editorial decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   And there have been other, quieter problems. Like the summary
dismissal, a day before Lundberg, of the AMA's top mental-health
specialist for allegedly inciting trouble by questioning a staff
reorganization. ``The only thing I had incited people to do was
talk to one another,'' responds the ousted Dr. Larry S. Goldman,
who is back teaching at the University of Chicago and says the AMA
has tried to keep him from communicating with former colleagues by
screening out his e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   The man behind the firings was Dr. E. Ratcliffe Anderson Jr., a
retired Air Force general brought in as executive vice president to
help restore the AMA's frayed image in the wake of the Sunbeam
fiasco. Instead he has created new waves of controversy. And last
month new doubts about his leadership were raised when a Missouri
court ruled it had been illegal for Anderson, in his former post as
head of a Kansas City hospital, to try and fire the chief of
radiology who'd been critical of him.
</P>
<P>
   While rumors contine to swirl that Anderson's job is in
jeopardy, AMA insiders insist that he actually is consolidating
control, and that the AMA board backed his firing of Lundberg and
other controversial moves. Anderson declined repeated requests for
interviews and has shunned the press since the Lundberg firing. But
Smoak, the AMA board chairman, says that ``since Dr. Anderson came
on board last summer we have been on course and our vision
certainly has been strong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, there have been several things that had to take
place that not always were pleasant and there were issues that
needed to be addressed and he addressed them properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say recent developments reflect a disturbing pattern _ of
Anderson using military-like discipline to purge the AMA of
critics, of the AMA board failing to anticipate or know how to
extricate itself from controversies that have plagued it, and of
the organization becoming so mired in internal machinations that it
has lost its impact on wider health issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pattern of disrepect, if you will, for due process,''
says Dr. Robert Kaiser, a gastroenterologist from a suburb near
here who tried unsuccessfully to get the Illinois State Medical
Society to take action on the Sunbeam and Lundberg cases.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jerome P. Kassirer, editor-in-chief of the New England
Journal of Medicine, also is distressed, by the firings as well as
the AMA's seeming move to the ideological right as evidenced by its
backing of a proposed ban on ``partial-birth'' abortions. ``I think
it has lost enormous ground,'' Kassirer argues. ``Though it says it
speaks for American medicine, it doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Many at AMA headquarters share those concerns, but are taking a
wait and see attitude.
</P>
<P>
   They're waiting most especially for the blue-ribbon panel of
independent doctors that the AMA has named to select a new JAMA
editor and to set up new rules to ensure the journal's
independence. While panel members decline to discuss their work
publicly, privately they say they're hopeful Anderson and the AMA
board will give JAMA the assurances it needs _ and if not, the
panel will abandon its search.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bracken, head of epidemiology at the Yale School of
Medicine, also is in what he calls ``a state of watchfulness'' over
the search for an editor and a wall of separation between the AMA
and JAMA. If such a separation is not assured, he adds, scientists
may stop submitting research papers to JAMA.
</P>
<P>
   While the search process proceeds, JAMA staff say they are
putting out the best publication they can. ``We're not standing
still, ringing our hands,'' says Phil Fontanarosa, the interim
coeditor. ``We're launching new initiatives, moving ahead with new
projects.''
</P>
<P>
   The JAMA search also could influence how much contention there
is when 4,500 or so doctors convene here for next month's AMA
annual meeting, which starts June 20. Some, like Kaiser, are almost
certain to mount a challenge, and at least one reformer will take
on a board-supported candidate for the vice speaker's post.
Delegates also will confront the cotentious issue of whether the
AMA should form a union-like collective bargaining unit.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Webster of Wisconsin, an AMA delegate and former
president of the American Academy of Dermatology, is hopeful the
AMA can emerge from its June meeting ready to tackle the
considerable challenges facing it. ``Am I optimistic?'' he asks.
``It's going to be a tough job, but if the AMA should fold we would
have to have another AMA-type organization to represent physicians
and the professional and ethical aspects of medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are more doubtful that the association can turn things
around. ``I haven't tossed in the sponge on the need for organized
medicine one bit, but what I have decided is that unless there's
some miracle turnaround in the AMA House of Delegates or board,
then an alternative to the AMA has to evolve,'' says Dr. Jerald
Schenken, who served on the board from 1985 to 1994, tried
unsuccessfully to get the executive vice president's job in 1989,
and has long been a leader among would-be reformers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are beginning to give up on the AMA all over the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the opposite is happening in Britain, where ``the British
Medical Association is in the forefront of arguing against nuclear
war and smoking, and for seat belts and human rights,'' says Dr.
Richard Smith, editor of the British Medical Journal, which has the
same relationship to the BMA that JAMA does to the AMA. ``And more
than 80 percent of doctors here belong to the BMA, which is the
highest it has ever been. That's partly because it negotiates terms
and conditions for doctors in the National Health Service, but also
because it does a very good job positioning itself alongside
patients.''

BEAUTY IS ONLY PEOPLE DEEP 
</HEADLINE>

   ``Teeth are important,'' Burt Bacharach tells People magazine.
This carries a lot of weight, coming as it does from one of the 50
Most Beautiful People in the World.
</P>
<P>
   It's that time of year again. A taste for the absurd draws me,
year after year, to the magazine's Beautiful People issue. Burt
Bacharach? But who am I to doubt the testimony of Angie Dickinson,
his ex-wife twice removed, who tells People, ``Not only is he
devastating-looking but he has this gentility about him, with lots
of strength but also a softness, like a prizefighter carrying
flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, readers can count on this issue of People to be
irresistibly ridiculous. It starts with the premise. The 50 Most
Beautiful People in the World? Says who? That's one of the reasons
people buy this issue, the editors note, to see how People's
choices compare to their own.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the editors seem to have taken particular pains to
diversify, and by so doing to challenge readers to expand their
personal definitions of what constitutes beauty. Along with
Michelle Pfeiffer, Joseph Fiennes, Ben Affleck, et al., the crop
includes Sudanese model Alek Wek, 63-year-old actress Gena
Rowlands, plus-size rapper/actress Queen Latifah, 70-year-old
composer Bacharach, and a number of other beauties of various
races, ethnic backgrounds, ages, sizes. This is commendable, I
guess, but it doesn't make the premise any less absurd.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the emphasis on diversity hasn't changed People's
peculiar editorial approach to its Beautiful People. This year's
emphasis is on personal grooming. What do Beautiful People do to
stay beautiful? Teeth are important, as Bacharach points out.
Melina Kanakaredes, star of the television drama ``Providence,''
concurs, confessing she never goes anywhere without her Braun
electric toothbrush. ``My parents were always saying, `Cavities!
Cavities!' Now I have a mouthful of them,'' she tells People
ruefully.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these revelations are delivered in an almost nannyish
tone, as if People's editors are bent not just on revealing the
beauty secrets of the fabulous 50 but on exhorting readers to
improve their own grooming habits, perhaps even by purchasing some
of the products conveniently advertised in its pages. So brush your
teeth. And do something about your hair. ``For guys, your hair is
your feature,'' says ``well-chiseled'' sculptor Toland Grinnell.
Skin, though, is most crucial, or ``skin is in,'' as People puts
it.
</P>
<P>
   Thus we learn that actor Rick Schroder of ``NYPD Blue''
cultivates his ``sun-cured skin,'' naughtily ignoring his wife's
sensible suggestion that he apply sunscreen. ``I'm going to look
like Robert Redford when I'm 40, very weathered and leathery,'' he
tells People hopefully. But, he adds, ``I think I need to start
adding some moisturizer, because my skin gets really dry.''
</P>
<P>
   Moisturizer looms large in these pages, which must please some
of People's bigger advertisers, such as Pond's and Revlon. Actress
Jennifer Lopez is ``never without moisturizer'' and switches brands
every few months because ``I feel my skin gets tired of just one.''
ITN news anchor Daljit Dhaliwal keeps a supply of Elizabeth Arden's
Eight-Hour Cream handy at all times.
</P>
<P>
   No reader can know for sure why some celebrities fail to make
the Beautiful People list. Maybe it all comes down to who has the
most aggressive publicity agent. I wonder if certain obvious
candidates were crossed off because they failed to meet People's
grooming standards. Julia Roberts, for example. But for those
much-publicized, and much-photographed, hairy armpits she might
have knocked Pfeiffer off the magazine's cover. Or maybe she
doesn't use enough moisturizer.

THE BAR CODE, AT 25 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago this June 26, an Ohio supermarket
executive named Clyde Dawson whisked a 67-cent ten-pack of
Wrigley's Juicy Fruit over a strange new contraption and officially
launched a now ubiquitous piece of technology, the supermarket
checkout scanner.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Dawson's successful test at the Marsh Supermarket in
Troy, Ohio, more than 27,000 US supermarkets have installed
scanners. The concept of scannable bar codes has boomed beyond
grocery stores to find uses in everything from processing mail and
medical samples to managing car-parts inventories and airline
baggage.
</P>
<P>
   The basic idea behind supermarket scanners is that most of the
tens of thousands of items for sale are identified by a unique
12-digit number. That number in turn is represented by a series of
lines and spaces of varying widths (30 lines and 29 spaces, as a
matter of fact, whatever the number).
</P>
<P>
   When a low-powered laser light is shone on the bar code, more
reflects back from the gaps than the lines, telling a reader inside
the machine what the product is. (Most shades of red cannot be used
anywhere in a bar code because lasers cannot see them.) The
supermarket's computer then reports the current price and deducts
the item from recorded inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Reading a bar code from the way it reflects light is a tricky
enough thing to do anyway. So scanners compensate by taking a vast
number of readings _ usually thousands per second.
</P>
<P>
   The typical supermarket scanner sends out a pattern of laser
light reflected off several mirrors by a spinning mirror.
Reflections are focused by a reading lens, then the machine
determines which images it sees are valid codes.
</P>
<P>
   Most supermarket bar codes consist of 12 numbers. The first
digit corresponds to a class of goods _ including 0, 6 or 7 for
general groceries, 2 for produce and meat, 5 for coupons, and 3 for
drugs and pharmacy goods.
</P>
<P>
   The next five digits are the manufacturer's code, and the next
five are specific to the item. Take a 10-ounce box of regular
Cheerios, 0 16000 66510 1: 16000 is General Mills's number and
66510 corresponds to that size and type of Cheerios. Other sized
boxes, frosted and honey nut have their own 5-digit reference.
</P>
<P>
   The 12th digit of a UPC code is called a ``modulo check digit.''
Odd and even numbers in the first 11 digits are multiplied and
added through a surprisingly complicated equation to yield a 12th
number, the check digit.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, it is unlikely that the hairs on a checkout
person's wrist would somehow correspond to the UPC number.
</P>
<P>
   Most of what a scanner does, in fact, involves ``filtering out
noise'' to determine what things it sees are really bar codes, says
Craig Maddox, product line director for bar code scanners with NCR
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of codes mounted on round cans or lumpy surfaces,
machines will take multiple readings from different directions,
then combine them to see what the code would look like if perfectly
flat.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers on the right side of the label are also represented in
mirror image from numbers on the left side, so if the machine reads
a can of corn upside down, it can figure out where the code begins
and ends.
</P>
<P>
   And some can even read ripped or damaged codes: When President
George Bush was caught in 1992 expressing seemingly
out-of-touch-with-reality amazement at the workings of a bar code
scanner, he was actually at an industry convention observing a
machine able to read a UPC code ripped into seven pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller products like cigarettes and baby food jars carry
seven-digit numbers. Through a technique called ``zero
suppression,'' 0s are omitted but in such a way the machine can
determine where they would fall in the underlying 12-digit code.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the 1970s, most scanners failed to read codes as often
as three times out of 10, Maddox said. The main reason was badly
printed UPC labels, aggravated by limited ability programmed in to
the machine to make sense of blurred labels.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Maddox said, the typical scanner gets 99 out of 100 items
on the first pass, reflecting tougher standards for producing UPC
labels and more intelligent code reading programs.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to develop something like the UPC system date back to
the late 1940s, including a failed system that used bullseye-like
patterns. A key 1969 grocery-industry summit led in March 1973 to
agreement on the linear bar code system.
</P>
<P>
   A Dayton, Ohio, organization called the Uniform Code Council
oversees issuing code numbers. It has signed up an estimated
210,000 manufacturers, and it costs a minimum of $350 to get a UPC
code.
</P>
<P>
   Because like phone numbers in area codes the supply of 1
trillion possible UPC numbers is nearing practical exhaustion, the
council has urged retailers to prepare for 13-digit UPC numbers
beginning in 2005.

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ The last time Chuck Leavell appeared in
public, he was banging out ``Sympathy for the Devil'' on the
keyboards as Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones preened before
20,000 screaming fans in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But when the ``No Security'' tour ended last month, the Georgia
piano player didn't follow his bandmates off to jet-set vacations.
Instead, he traded in the glitz for tweed, and went to the
ivy-decked halls of Yale University to lecture on conserving
American forests.
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary meeting of the worlds of rock 'n roll and
elite academics, Leavell came to America's oldest forestry school
last Monday to tell the story of his award-winning tree farm where
men named Baby Joe and Bimbo work the land and where the
conservation ethic comes from a deep Southern sense of place and
family.
</P>
<P>
   Leavell's appearance turned staid college professors into
autograph hounds, and prompted organizers from the Yale Forest
Forum to sneak in a baby grand piano in hopes that he would play.
(He did.)
</P>
<P>
   Leavell, in turn, was touched that Yale would want to hear his
story. A musician who has performed for tens of thousands with
entertainers from Eric Clapton to the Allman Brothers to the
Stones, Leavell seemed awestruck by his audience of 150.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a high school dropout to be invited to Yale to talk about
anything, it's quite an honor. I'll cherish it for the rest of my
life,'' said Leavell, with a Yale School of Forestry and
Environmental Studies pin on his lapel.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Leavell had a message beyond celebrity. Unlike other
rockers-turned-environmentalists such as Don Henley and Sting,
Leavell gets his hands dirty managing the environment, spending
long days on the tractor at his 1,900-acre farm, Charlane.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Leavell spoke for an often-overlooked group in the
environmental debate, private individuals who own much of the
American landscape. He called for conservation, to be sure, but he
also warned against laws that tie the hands of owners, preventing
them from logging or hunting on their land.
</P>
<P>
   To some, the 47-year-old self-described ``rock 'n roll tree
farmer'' is an enigma, living two lives that seem incompatible. On
the farm outside of Macon that he owns with his wife Rose Lane,
Leavell is up by 6 a.m., preparing for the day's chores. On tour
with the Stones, 6 a.m. is more likely to be bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   But Leavell, a dapper, gray-bearded man who speaks in a gentle
drawl, has no problem moving from one job to the other, eagerly
heading for the woods whenever he gets home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are 180 degrees apart as far as lifestyles, but I find
the farm really provides a psychological balance . . . It allows
you to get perspective on what is really important,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Leavell talks about managing the land in much the same
way that he talks about the blues music he grew up with in rural
Alabama. Both are inheritances that need to be passed down to the
next generation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's the other members of the Rolling Stones who have a hard
time understanding Leavell's farm life. Sure, drummer Charlie Watts
has a horse farm, but he doesn't actually ride the horses. And
Jagger once complained that publicity for Leavell's tree farm
diverts attention from concert ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``They scratch their heads a lot about it. They're amused about
it, but they know I'm sincere,'' said Leavell, who has tried in
vain to get fellow Stones to visit his tree farm since he began
touring with the band in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Leavell is good at growing pine trees, and
protecting nature as well. He and his wife have set aside 20 acres
of nature trails, they invite school groups to tour the land, and
they leave aside portions of the property for duck, quail, and
other wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   In recognition, Leavell has twice been named Georgia Tree Farmer
of the Year, and he is currently up for regional tree farmer of the
year. Now, along with University of Georgia officials, he is
writing a book on the history of forest management.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Leavell is not a typical celebrity environmentalist,
appearing at benefits for the rainforests and the like. Leavell
says society must balance the need to preserve trees with
humanity's voracious appetite for wood products from his own piano
to the morning newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ecologists' view that you should never cut a tree, never
dig a hole, never kill a thing . . . That's not reality,'' said
Leavell.
</P>
<P>
   Leavell knew almost nothing about forests until 1981 when his
wife inherited a run down cattle and vegetable farm from her
grandmother. The farm had been in the family since the 1920s, but
it carried a large tax liability, and he was too busy touring to
pay the tab by tending a conventional farm.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of keeping the farm together, Leavell tried
tree-farming, which required less day to day management. In 1982,
he took a correspondence course in tree farming through the Georgia
Extension Service, and Leavell's second career began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were touring with the Fabulous Thunderbirds and I'm sitting
in the back of the bus doing my homework: trees, trees, trees,''
recalled Leavell.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Leavell's accomplishments as a tree farmer, he was
stunned when Yale forestry graduate student Alex Finkral e-mailed
him with an invitation to speak at Yale. The Yale Forest Forum,
after all, is a place where distinguished scientists and
policymakers, such as the head of the US Forest Service, hold forth
on important subjects such as forest ethics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe that I'm at Yale University,'' said Leavell,
beaming from behind the podium. ``I feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the audience gamely tried to stick to the subject of
Leavell's talk _ even asking about his hardwood management strategy
_ questions eventually turned to the Rolling Stones, and Leavell
confessed that he is awestruck, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mick Jagger is the most amazing front man in rock 'n roll,''
said Leavell. ``I'm up there playing and I can't keep my eyes off
Mick because he is so entertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   As for lead guitar player Keith Richards, known for his hard
partying, Leavell called him a masterful musician though ``some
people may wonder why he's still walking the planet.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Leavell finished his talk, followed by a rollicking
version of ``Route 66'' on the baby grand, forest management had
given way to standing ovations and celebrity worship.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a crack up. All the professors are asking for
autographs,'' laughed professor Lynne Bennett, clutching the
promotional poster Leavell signed for her.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Leavell's message of balance in the woods wasn't lost in
the hoopla. ``What he is doing is so monumentally important, not
just maintaining the property . . . but building on it in a
creative way,'' said Yale lecturer and Stones fan Paul Draghi.

still expensive glitches in and transportation. And China's woes
could spill over to Hong Kong, where banks, brokerages, and

<HEADLINE>
`THE GRANDDADDY OF ALL TOBACCO LIES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A &UR;  &LR; newspaper ad, full-page. Stark background. Large type.
``Cigarettes kill more Americans every year than car wrecks, plane
crashes, AIDS, alcohol, drugs, suicides, and homicides combined.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a terrifying statistic.
</P>
<P>
   Good thing it's not true.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the falsehoods hammered home in the war on tobacco, none
is more pervasive than the one about the body count: 400,000 deaths
from smoking per year. Over and over we have been told that smoking
is not just unhealthy, but massively and catastrophically lethal.
</P>
<P>
   --Elizabeth Whelan, president of the American Council on Health
and Science: ``If every single day two filled-to-capacity jumbo
jets crashed _ killing all on board _ the death toll would not
approach that accounted for each year by cigarette smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   --Bill Novelli, founder of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids:
``If you want to draw a hierarchy of harms or social problems,
you'd probably end up putting tobacco on top . . . . Tobacco is
like an atomic bomb on the horizon.''
</P>
<P>
   --William Foege, former director of the Centers for Disease
Control: ``It is quite predictable that in the coming years, the
annual global death toll of tobacco will equal the total death toll
of the Holocaust in Nazi Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   Ghastly as such rhetoric is, worse is on the way. The $246
billion tobacco settlement will be used, in part, to fund even more
antismoking propaganda. From print ads, from billboards, from radio
and TV, the message will be pounded at you: Tobacco, the worst of
all killers, slaughters 400,000 Americans every year.
</P>
<P>
   Except that it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be blunt,'' write Robert Levy and Rosalind Marimont,
``there is no credible evidence that 400,000 deaths per year _ or
any number remotely close to 400,000 _ are caused by tobacco. . . .
The damage from cigarettes is far less than it is made out to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy is an expert in law and finance who teaches statistics at
Georgetown University Law Center. Marimont is a mathematician and
scientist who spent 37 years at the National Institute of Standards
and Technology and the National Institute of Health. If you read
nothing else about smoking this year, read their article ``Lies,
Damned Lies, &AMP; 400,000 Smoking-Related Deaths'' in the new issue of
Regulation, a quarterly journal published by the Cato Institute
(www.cato.org).
</P>
<P>
   What Levy and Marimont call ``the granddaddy of all tobacco
lies'' comes from a 1993 report of the Centers for Disease Control,
which estimated that 419,000 Americans had died in 1990 of diseases
attributable to smoking. A disease was attributed to smoking if the
risk of dying from it was greater for smokers than for nonsmokers.
But here's the rub _ one of several rubs, actually: the CDC
included in its death toll diseases for which the relative risk to
smokers was statistically insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   It is reasonable to claim that a smoker's lung cancer death was
smoking-related, inasmuch as a smoker is 23 times more likely to
die of that disease than a nonsmoker. But it is not reasonable to
make the same claim for cancer of the pancreas, since the relative
risk of that disease for smokers is minuscule _ between 1.1 and 1.8
(i.e., a smoker isn't even twice as likely as a nonsmoker to
contract pancreatic cancer.) The National Cancer Institute, in
guidelines quoted by Levy and Marimont, cautions against relying on
relative risks of less than 2. ``Such increases may be due to
chance, statistical bias, or effects of confounding factors not
evident.''
</P>
<P>
   Apply that rule to the CDC's 419,000 tobacco-related deaths, and
39 percent of them _ 164,000 _ disappear. A smoker who dies from
pancreatic cancer (or a dozen other diseases on the CDC list with
relative risks of less than 2), is not a victim of tobacco. To call
him one is to engage in sophistry, not science.
</P>
<P>
   Another statistical trick built into the smoking body count is
the failure to correct for other variables. Tobacco use is not the
only difference between Americans who smoke and Americans who
don't. Levy and Marimont note that smokers tend to be people who
also drink too much, exercise too little, eat fewer green
vegetables, and have less money. ``Each of those factors can be a
`cause' of death from a so-called smoking-related disease,'' they
write, ``and each must be statistically controlled for if the
impact of a single factor, like smoking, is to be reliably
determined.''
</P>
<P>
   Controlling for just two of those differences _ income and
alcohol consumption _ reduces the tobacco toll by another 53,000.
Take the other factors into account and it would go lower still.
But the CDC and the surgeon general treat those factors as
irrelevant. ``If a smoker who is obese; has a family history of
high cholesterol, diabetes, and heart problems; and never exercises
dies of a heart attack, the government attributes his death to
smoking alone.'' By that logic, one could just as easily show that
504,000 Americans die yearly from failure to exercise, or that
649,000 die from bad nutrition. Like the supposed 400,000
smoking-related victims, say Levy and Marimont, these are
``computer-generated phantom deaths, not real deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   There's more. For all the talk of protecting children, the
average age of death from a smoking-related illness is 72. Measured
by years of life lost, smoking is a much smaller problem than
alcohol consumption. The number of young people killed by smoking
is _ zero. All this and more Levy and Marimont calmly explain.
Their lucid article provides a fine corrective to the ever more
hysterical tone of the antitobacco crusade. You may wish to lay in
a copy.

THE CORROSIVE EFFECTS OF HUMILIATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Humiliation is the feeling that, it seems, is the most difficult
to talk about. It is familiar to every second-grader who got no
valentines, to every youngster chosen last in a pick-up game, to
every person ostracized by the in crowd. It is also visited on
those oppressed and persecuted by force, from the victims of
colonialism to the women raped as part their expulsion from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the wake of the tragedy in Littleton, it is a feeling
very much on the minds _ if not the lips _ of those who have
suffered through it, or witnessed its searing force.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike its cousins _ embarrassment and guilt _ humiliation is an
emotion that often does not erode with time. It can linger a
lifetime. It can also build.
</P>
<P>
   Nina Campbell was 5 when her North Charleston, S.C.,
kindergarten teacher wrote on her face with an indelible blue
marker, ``Where are my glasses?''
</P>
<P>
   ``All the kids teased her; the bus driver on the way home said
`What happened to you?','' recalled Teresa Campbell, Nina's mother.
``She was in tears when she got off the bus and when she got to my
door she was devastated.''
</P>
<P>
   The words were visible for two weeks. Now, three years later and
after a successful lawsuit against the school district, Nina still
suffers the sting of that humiliation, her mother said. Adding to
her confusion: The woman who wrote on Nina's face was nominated
this year as teacher of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Humiliation _ being stripped of one's dignity _ does something
to the psyche that other emotions, such as shame, cannot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You live with shame, you may feel badly about yourself, but
you try to restore your own self-regard, and within a few days, it
washes away,'' says Dr. Lloyd Sederer, medical director and
executive vice president of McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humiliation is shame squared.''
</P>
<P>
   One hallmark of humiliation is the difficulty we have talking
about it, or sometimes even acknowledging it. We can talk about the
embarrassing time we tripped, or didn't zip our pants. We can
acknowledge guilt by confessing it, apologizing, and moving on. In
fact, June Tangney, a professor of psychology at George Mason
University who specializes in the psychology of shame and guilt,
says feeling and expressing guilt is a sign of an empathetic
person. ``It is related to positive aspects of people.''
</P>
<P>
   But not so with humiliation, which is something people have
great difficulty in expressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never confess to anyone the things that humiliated us;
they are the things you don't reveal to anyone,'' says William Ian
Miller, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School and
author of ``Humiliation: And Other Essays on Honor, Social
Discomfort, and Violence.''
</P>
<P>
   We are most likely to be humiliated during adolescence and as we
grow old because both are periods when our sense of self and our
capabilities often collide.
</P>
<P>
   In old age, as the mind or body can no longer do what one
expects it to do, the result is something much deeper than
embarrassment. In adolescence, there is great importance in how
others perceive you, in the regard you are afforded. Insults,
ostracism, both can weigh heavily.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value that (lies) in the formation of identity of
adolescents is critical,'' says Sederer. And adolescents most
frequently measure themselves against their parents, which makes it
even harder to turn to those parents for support in difficult
times.
</P>
<P>
   While no one knows what drove Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold to
murder 12 of their fellow Columbine High School students, a
teacher, and then take their own lives last month, several students
of the clique to which the 17- and 18-year-olds belonged have
detailed a litany of abuse that some members of the so-called
Trenchcoat Mafia suffered at the hands of the more popular,
powerful jocks. There were constant taunts, they say, ranging from
``dirtbag'' to ``faggot,'' physical abuse such as being slammed up
against lockers, pelted with rocks and sodas, and forced to bus the
jocks' trays in the cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   Ethicist Sissela Bok, a distinguished fellow at the Center for
Population and Development Studies at Harvard University and author
of ``Mayhem: Violence As Public Entertainment,'' cautions that it
is impossible to pinpoint one source for the motivation of the
killers, but says that humiliation plays an important role in many
murders.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people to be able to cross the line and kill another human
being, several things have to happen,'' Bok says. ``First of all,
they have to have the feeling that this is authorized, as in war
where it is ordered, or they belong to a group or a cult that
regards it as all right. A big difference is also if they can talk
themselves into thinking `Those people are humiliating me.' . . .
We know that almost all serial killers were tremendously abused as
children, and humiliation is one part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Can anything good ever come of feeling humiliated? There are
those who say yes. ``To be able to harness the energy that is
unleashed in people who have been humiliated, and use it in a
productive way, can make someone go a long way,'' says Rev. Richard
E. Spalding, co-pastor of the Church of the Covenant, in Boston's
Back Bay, whose recent sermon dealt with Columbine and humiliation.
``Look at Nelson Mandela. Apartheid was an ironclad system of
humiliation which required the degradation of people and he was
able to harness the energy out of that for change without rancor.''
</P>
<P>
   Humiliation can also galvanize a nation. Jesse Jackson's 1988
campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination in large part
relied on the theme of ``I am somebody,'' his longtime clarion call
to the young, the dispossessed, the humiliated.
</P>
<P>
   Today, more and more courts around the nation are including
humiliation as part of their sentencing. Drunk drivers are forced
to put warning stickers on the bumpers of their cars; men arrested
for soliciting prostitutes have their pictures published in local
papers; and pedophiles have warning signs placed on their lawns.
</P>
<P>
   There is no data, however, to indicate that humiliating an
offender is anything more than a quick fix of revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you shame an offender, as opposed to encourage them to
grapple with the bad effects of their behavior, it does not
encourage people to take responsibility, but elicits increased
anger and rage,'' says George Mason's Tangney,. ``Research shows
this is a misguided approach.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one federal judge agreed, striking down as
unconstitutional New York City's celebrated and storied ``perp
walk,'' where those arrested are paraded in front of the media. The
case was brought by a doorman who was arrested for theft, paraded
before cameras, lost his job, and later was acquitted of the
charges. His trial for damages is scheduled to begin next week in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
   There are ways to overcome humiliation, some more successful
than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of diminishing the pain, if you can find islands of
dignity in this ocean of humiliation, it helps,'' says Sederer, the
McLean physician. ``As you build up the islands, and the mass is
greater, you may be on land more often than drowning in the ocean.
But does the water ever go away? Not in cases where the humiliation
is profound and overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to accomplish this, he says, is to work to spare others
the same experience you have suffered. That gives someone purpose,
which gives dignity.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the advice that Jesus gave his disciples _
turn the other cheek _ to, as Rev. Spalding put it, ``cultivate an
inner landscape that makes it possible not to return evil for
evil.'' And in some ways, that can be an antidote to humiliation,
specialists say. The act of choosing not to do something, in this
case to offer the other cheek, can help restore honor that was
lost.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most frequently employed method and least likely to
succeed against humiliation is denial, or its flip-side, limitless
self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever one thinks of President Clinton, his ability to
continue to do his job while the impeachment effort (and all its
sordid manifestations and revelations) took front and center in the
nation's consciousness for more than a year was nothing short of
remarkable. ``How could anyone go through that and not be
humiliated?'' Miller asks. ``Clinton is one of those people with an
infinite reservoir of self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   Humor, too, is a powerful defense against humiliation. Certainly
professional comedians like Rodney Dangerfield and filmmaker Woody
Allen have made careers out of appearing as failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using humor is a complex move,'' says Miller. ``By making that
claim, it preempts anyone from humiliating you. There is the
refined sense that the smarter people are the ones who see their
own flaws. People understand that as a threat, and know the barrels
could be turned on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sederer says that by exposing your own humiliation through humor
you are controlling it and the ``trauma is often digested.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dangerfield says his motives are much more simple. Asked why
he developed his ``no respect'' shtick, he responds: ``When `The
Godfather' came out, it was filled with respect: `You got to show
me respect.' `You got to show her respect because she is with me.'
All I heard was `respect' `respect' `respect.' I thought there
might be a cute thing there if I turned it around.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I wrote one joke: `I played hide and seek and they wouldn't
look for me. I tell ya, I get no respect.' I tried it out, and it
worked, and I wrote thousands of `no respect' jokes. I thought
people might identify with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if they don't want to talk about it.

A YOUNG DOLE SHOWED SIGNS OF DRIVE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALISBURY, N.C. _ Elizabeth Hanford Dole's first venture into
presidential politics was, by her own account, a bomb. Despite a
spirited campaign invoking the name of Queen Elizabeth and the
slogan ``the modern world is giving women a big part to play,''
Liddy Hanford _ in 1953 the first girl to run for president of
Boyden High School _ lost to the male machine.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lesson in how to lose, a gracious and grown-up Dole
recalled in her autobiography, ``Unlimited Partners.'' But it also
was a failure that she determined then and there never to repeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liddy made a promise to herself that she would move on and
prepare better next time,'' said Mack Lampert, a Dole classmate
since kindergarten and still a friend. ``There were no sour grapes,
but in my opinion, she's been trying to make up for it ever
since.''
</P>
<P>
   Just four years later, she got it right. Dole's 1957 campaign
for president of the Women's Student Government Association at Duke
University was so well-oiled and her message so effective that even
her opponent voted for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so well-spoken, so thoughtful, so poised _ I had to
support her,'' recalled Karen Black Miller, who now lives in
Greensboro, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Dole has something greater to prove: that she has the
strength, stomach, and savvy to compete in a large field of
Republican men to become the first female presidential candidate of
either major party. Her friends in her native state aren't
surprised: The woman they still see as both a pioneer and a work in
progress has always had her eye on the biggest prize.
</P>
<P>
   She came of age when girls were groomed to be ladies and wives,
and careers were meant for men. That didn't quite suit the
goal-directed Dole, who described herself as ``an in-between''
female of the '50s. ``It had been said, somewhat cynically, that
there were girls with dates and girls with data,'' she wrote about
her time at Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dole didn't wait a decade for the feminist movement to
open doors for her. Blending brains and ambition, self-discipline,
and Southern charm, Boyden High's 1954 ``Girl Most Likely to
Succeed'' became Duke's ``Leader of the Year'' in 1958 and one of a
few women in the Harvard Law School class of 1965.
</P>
<P>
   ``She saw a place for herself in the world that pulled her to
challenges other women of her day wouldn't even consider,'' said
Margaret Kluttz, one of Dole's girlhood friends and a former mayor
of Salisbury, a town of 24,000 north of Charlotte. ``I have no
doubt about her readiness to be president. She has been preparing
for this all of her life.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Questions on her campaign &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps overprepared, say critics who think Dole is too
cautious, controlling, and thin-skinned to survive the
rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. At 62, this is her
first run for public office despite an impressive resume of
government service, including two Cabinet posts, and enviable
political contacts, not the least of which is her husband, Bob, the
former Senate majority leader and 1996 GOP presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Dole demonstrated she can stray from the expected
script when she took on the National Rifle Association _ and got
booed at a New Hampshire GOP dinner _ with a call for stricter
gun-control measures in the wake of the Littleton, Colo., school
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Her campaign committee, still in the exploratory stage, crowed
about a new USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll showing Dole in second place
in the GOP field, 18 points behind but gaining ground on Texas
Governor George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Dole and Bush are the current odd couple of Republican politics.
He hones the image of a Texas wildcatter from a Connecticut Yankee
family, the boy who played hard but didn't work very hard in prep
school. She, by contrast, was Miss Prim and Perfect, the
straight-arrow debutante who compulsively tried to please her
parents and was so put together that she painted and repainted the
frames of her glasses to match her frocks.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bush, Dole was a child of privilege. John Hanford, her
father, was a formidable businessman, a workaholic, and a staunch
anticommunist who built a family bomb shelter and made a fortune in
wholesale flowers. Mary Cathey Hanford, her mother, was the
quintessential Southern matriarch, strong of faith, industrious as
a community volunteer. She is said to have doted on her talented
daughter and obsessed with the achievements and success of the
little girl who nicknamed herself ``Liddy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hanford, who had given up a promising musical career to
marry and raise a family, seemed to live vicariously through her
daughter, friends said. Now 98 and ailing, Hanford has made the
family's large and handsome Tudor home on historic Fulton Street a
shrine to Dole, and she has filled 24 scrapbooks with her famous
child's clippings, photos, and awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother instilled a strong sense of duty and responsibility in
Elizabeth,'' said John Hanford, Dole's only brother, 13 years her
senior. ``In everything she did, Elizabeth gave it her best shot.
She was really quite exceptional.''
</P>
<P>
   While Dole still calls her mother ``my best friend,'' Mrs.
Hanford's expectations put intense pressure on her daughter to
produce _ not simply to do her homework, a dominant theme in Dole's
life _ but also to win essay contests, perform in piano recitals,
get the best grades, and collect pennies for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a strong work ethic on South Fulton Street,'' wrote
Dole, who did not respond to requests for an interview.
``Self-improvement was a measure of personal growth. It was also a
way to satisfy my goal-oriented parents.''
</P>
<P>
   To satisfy her maternal grandmother, also named Mary Cathey,
Dole dutifully spent Sunday afternoons in her parlor listening to
Bible stories. Dole attributes a deep spirituality more to the
lessons of her devout grandmother than to the sermons in the United
Methodist Church to which her parents belonged.
</P>
<P>
   Even at play, Dole strived for perfection. Lampert, the friend
since kindergarten, remembers how Dole came home from college one
summer to find her friends water-skiing. Self-conscious as a child
about her lack of athletic ability, Dole got an instructor and fell
into the lake ``over and over again,'' Lampert said, until she
mastered the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a boy, I was impressed at how her wheels were turning, how
she knew she needed the skill and was willing to take the fall to
acquire it,'' Lampert said.
</P>
<P>
   It was an idyllic time for the well-to-do in post-war Salisbury,
which was then a strictly segregated town and is still proud of its
downtown monument honoring Confederate soldiers. Along with fine
manners, gracious living, and social connections, the sense of
noblesse oblige was strong here in the 1950s, and many of her
friends believe it is where Dole learned the art of networking and
the value of public service.

TO DIVIDE IS NOT TO CONQUER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a measure of how much we need one another in trying times
that 94 percent of Columbine High School's students returned to
class last week in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of how little we learn from one another that
some of the students not in attendance had been asked by school
officials to stay away.
</P>
<P>
   Because their own school is now a crime scene, the site of the
worst school shooting in US history, Columbine's athletes,
cheerleaders, and most of the 1,965-member student body were
welcomed to neighboring Chatfield High.
</P>
<P>
   Because two of their friends are the presumed gunmen who
executed 12 classmates and a teacher before turning their guns on
themselves, members of the outcast clique known as the Trenchcoat
Mafia were urged to stay home.
</P>
<P>
   Returning students wore T-shirts proclaiming ``We are
Columbine'' in the school's blue and white colors. Exiled students
were told black trenchcoats will no longer be tolerated in school.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't this where we came in?
</P>
<P>
   The Jefferson County Sheriff described the eight to 10 students
offered home schooling last week as ``friends or acquaintances'' of
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, not their co-conspirators. He said
they are ``witnesses, not suspects.'' Yet, Rick Kaufman, a
spokesman for the schools, said home schooling was ``in the best
interest of those students as well as the other students.''
</P>
<P>
   How is it in anyone's best interest to isolate children from a
school community from which they already feel estranged? Aren't
they grieving, too? Many of them had friends on both sides of those
guns. The grief they share with their more mainstream Columbine
classmates is no doubt compounded by guilt that two boys they
thought they knew turned out to be killers. Who at Columbine needs
those ubiquitous classroom counselors more than they do?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to get back to some normal schedule,'' Kaufman
told reporters. ``There's still about four weeks of school left so
there is still plenty of learning yet to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is, what kind of learning? By exiling these
children, aren't school administrators teaching guilt by
association? Aren't they telling these children explicitly what
they have long suspected _ that they do not belong?
</P>
<P>
   And what lessons are school officials teaching students who
first labeled these kids the Trenchcoat Mafia, hurled epithets at
them, smeared them with mashed potatoes in the cafeteria, and
slammed them into lockers in the corridors? Tolerance?
</P>
<P>
   No one who watched heartbroken teenagers autograph Rachel
Scott's coffin or heard tearful accounts from those trapped inside
the library during the worst of the gunfire would minimize the mix
of anguish and rage felt by survivors of the massacre at Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   But the only path out of despair is through it. If students
suspect that friends of Klebold and Harris knew, or should have
known, what the gunmen had planned, that mistrust will only be
fueled by their absence from school. Why not confront their mutual
suspicion together and, in so doing, perhaps put it to rest?
</P>
<P>
   The nation is not doing much better than Littleton in the
aftermath of the carnage at Columbine. In our vigilance to reassure
our children that we can protect them, we are demonstrating,
instead, that we have no idea what we are doing.
</P>
<P>
   Having failed to act, now we overreact. Having failed to detect
two dangerous adolescents, now we presume all adolescents a
potential danger.
</P>
<P>
   What price are we willing to pay for a sense of security, no
matter how false, in our schools? At what cost do we bolt the
lockers in Waterbury, Conn., and require students to carry their
books in transparent bags? At what cost do we allow a scribbled
threat on a bathroom stall to so frighten students in Cohasset that
25 percent of them stay home from school? What price do we pay for
suspending elementary school children for nothing more than
ill-considered, thoughtless remarks?
</P>
<P>
   We have all, in some measure, been traumatized by events in
Littleton but we need to move away from our irrational fears. Carol
Samson, a Columbine English teacher, compared the challenge facing
her school community to that of a symphony conductor. ``We'll have
to understand what all the different pieces do, and then bring them
together,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   No conductor, no matter how skilled, could do that if the string
section was missing.

   TAKE-BOS  
 SALISBURY, N.C.... public service.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``If you had the means, the time, and the ability, you had the
obligation to do the right thing,'' said Rose Post, a longtime
reporter for the Salisbury Post who has covered Dole's career from
her days at Duke to her most recent job as head of the American Red
Cross. ``Liddy is a product of this noblesse oblige.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends remember Dole as a girl who was popular, fun, and loved
to laugh. ``She wasn't some gooey little thing,'' said Peggy
Looney, one of 18 girls in a clique known as the ``Debs'' that Dole
led. ``She didn't do anything that was wicked, but she wasn't
always toeing the line, either.''
</P>
<P>
   But she was different, the overachieving product of parents who
encouraged her to think for herself and be independent. ``Most
Southern girls were strictly taught how, when, and where things
were properly done,'' said Meetta Lampert, another Dole classmate
and also a Deb. ``I was told I could be a nurse or a teacher or a
mother. Being a lawyer like Liddy never would have entered my
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Mrs. Hanford tried to steer her daughter into home
economics in college, but Dole preferred political science. Dole
carefully built a case and consensus in her family for the course
she wanted to take _ a recurring pattern through her career as Dole
repeatedly defied convention and her parents' hopes that she would
return home.
</P>
<P>
   There was no debate about Duke: Dole's brother had been a Big
Man on Campus at the Durham school, and it was the prestige choice
of parents in the South who wanted more than a finishing school for
their daughters. ``Duchesses'' took classes with Duke men, but they
lived on a separate campus and had their own deans, clubs,
organizations, and student leaders.
</P>
<P>
   They also had their own handbook of social standards. According
to ``Design for a Duchess,'' proper Duke women wore hats and hose
to church, sunbathed only in a designated area behind the gym, and
never talked out the window to friends. Not every rule was enforced
_ many, in fact, were ridiculed _ but manners, civility, and
reserve perfumed the air.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere in Durham was perfect for Dole. She found the
deans to be strong mentors, like her mother and grandmother, and
the opportunities for leadership that boys denied her in high
school were wide open and encouraged in Duke's Woman's College. She
took a class in public speaking, virtually unheard of for a woman,
and she not only majored in the man's field of political science
but also earned the department's highest honors at graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Budding politician that she was, Dole plunged into sorority life
and student activities, from the choir to the newspaper to the
drama club, making a name for herself and building constituencies
across the campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything Liddy did, she did for a reason,'' said Ellen
Bradley Cole of Chelmsford, a member of Duke's class of 1958 and
head of the women's judicial board her senior year. ``Everybody
accepted her ambition. That was our Liddy _ get ahead! _ but I'm
not sure everybody liked her.''
</P>
<P>
   Classmates who found Dole too good to be true urged Miller _
then Karen Black _ to oppose Dole in the race for student
government president. It proved to be a daunting experience for the
unprepared Miller. Dole covered the campus with posters and
pictures, presented a solid platform, and gave an excellent stump
speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think she is programmed for this presidential race,''
said Miller, who lost to Dole in a landslide. ``I can tell you,
she's been programmed all her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole campaigned as a progressive who would respect tradition but
still work to change restrictive rules, such as dorm-closing hours.
``With our changing world, it was and is necessary for us to change
in order to adapt, even in our university life,'' Dole said in her
1957 speech to the women students. ``We must remember that our
influence is far-reaching, for Duke graduates will become leaders
in our world tomorrow.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Organized and focused &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Battle Rankin Robinson, a retired state judge in Delaware and
Dole's classmate at the Woman's College, remembers Dole as an
``amazing'' student leader. ``I had been in student government in
high school, but I had never seen anyone as organized and focused
as she. It was inspiring. She changed my whole view of how
organizations should run.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Dole came to the job prepared. After the editor of the
school newspaper, the Duke Chronicle, criticized the
president-elect for lacking knowledge of parliamentary procedure,
Dole spent the summer memorizing Robert's Rules of Order. ``Come
September . . . I could have held my own with the legislature in
Raleigh,'' Dole wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Her female classmates rewarded her well, tapping her for White
Duchy, an exclusive, secret sorority of outstanding seniors, and
electing her May Queen, an honor recognizing community service more
than beauty.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, the Duke Chronicle named Dole ``Leader of the Year,''
the single student, man or woman, who had ``contributed most
significantly to the improvement of the university.'' The newspaper
cited her efforts to establish a campus-wide honor code, expand the
foreign-exchange program, provide student-leadership training, and
maintain good relations with the administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't make waves, and she most certainly didn't take
risks,'' Cole recalled. ``She was the type who always wanted smooth
sailing.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't necessarily seem that way back in Salisbury. Dole's
path from Duke to Harvard, with a summer at Oxford University in
England in between _ increasingly perplexed the Hanfords. According
to Dole, her mother ``lost her dinner'' the night in 1962 when her
only daughter, who already had a master's degree in education,
announced her intention to go to law school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you want to be a wife and a mother and a hostess for
your husband?'' Hanford asked her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Dole acknowledged it had crossed her mind, but her brother said
he knew it wasn't immediately in the cards. ``Back in Elizabeth's
years, there was no such thing as women having it all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole did have a serious boyfriend named Dick Jones at Duke, and
some in Salisbury were surprised when an engagement ring didn't
follow the fraternity pin she wore.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were quite in love, but they couldn't get together on how
much leeway Dick would give Liddy,'' Looney said. ``He wanted to
practice law in a small town in the mountains, and I don't think
that was the way Liddy wanted to spend her life.''

WHEN PARENTS NEED ANSWERS, THEY TURN TO NETMOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The other night, I found myself in a chat room on America
Online, waiting for Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine to get
to the point. Along with Hillary Rosen, president of the Recording
Industry Association of America, Morello was on-line to discuss
violent music in the aftermath of the shootings in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of addressing the subject, Morello began with a
screed about the war in the Balkans and got on a soap box about
politicians decrying violent lyrics while NATO engages in a bloody
bombing campaign. Morello certainly wasn't the first to make that
connection, but the thing was, nobody in the chat room was there to
discuss it. Most of the teen-agers just wanted to type love letters
to Morello, but some of the parents on-line had genuine concerns.
What, if anything, should they be doing to monitor their kids'
exposure to pop culture? And what about the Internet? How do you
ensure kids' safety on-line without hindering their exposure to its
enormous potential?
</P>
<P>
   Forget the chat room: All you got there was ``Blah, blah, blah,
Yugoslavia,'' ``Blah, blah, blah, President Clinton,'' and ``Blah,
blah, blah, Tom Morello is God.'' I gave up and zapped off an
e-mail to NetMom, an expert in youth culture on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Parents are concerned, NetMom replied. She's seen a dramatic
increase in hits to her informative site (www.NetMom.com) since the
Littleton tragedy. ``Kids are more savvy about the Internet than
their parents are,'' says NetMom, aka Jean Armour Polly, a former
librarian and author of ``The Internet Kids and Family Yellow
Pages.'' ``But that doesn't mean parents should go off the deep end
and pull the plug. They should investigate it. If you don't have it
at home, go to a cyber cafe or the public library. See what's out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Polly is an Internet pioneer and something of a Net evangelist
(she coined the term ``surfing the Net''), and she's not about to
offer alarmist views about cyberspace. ``There are dangers out
there, but outweighing those dangers is the wonder of the Internet
and the fabulous sites created for and by kids. The educational
benefits are so rich, and I'd hate to see parents scared off
because of stories saying that the Internet is evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely. Polly urges parents to allow the Internet into their
homes on their own terms. And she offers some sensible advice on
how to do just that. The first thing, of course, involves
old-fashioned, non-technical communication. ``People don't talk to
their kids,'' she says. ``You can have someone on-line talking in a
chat room about how to be a better parent while their own kid is on
the floor behind them. It's so funny. You can reach across the
globe in a chat room, but why can't you reach out to your own
kids?''
</P>
<P>
   That's lesson number one. But what about that eerie feeling that
your kids are one click ahead of you out there in cyberspace? Here
are NetMom's suggestions. Some parents opt to filter the Internet
in a variety of ways. First, some Internet service providers filter
certain content for children; these providers can be found by
checking out http://thelist.internet.com; do a search on
``filtered.'' AOL, for instance, offers its members a parental
control option.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the filtering software packages, which have been
controversial since they came on the market. First Amendment
activists are against them as a general rule, especially in public
libraries. But even the staunchest free speech advocates would
admit that people can make their own choices about what content
comes into their homes. These packages, which include products like
CyberSitter and SmartFilter, allow parents to block pages that
contain pornography and hate speech. When they were first
introduced, they were creaky, blocking sites that might have a
chicken breast recipe or a discussion of breast cancer. They've
gotten better, though, and the question ``To filter or not to
filter'' is a personal choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have filters in our house,'' Polly says. ``Son of
NetMom (Stephen) is almost 13, and we do a lot of talking about
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Son of NetMom, of course, is pretty adept on-line. And his
mother can tell you about plenty of places where kids can learn
on-line in a safe environment. She raves about some of the search
engines designed specifically for children. The popular Ask Jeeves
site, for instance, has a site designed for youngsters called Ask
Jeeves for Kids (www.ajkids.com). Polly also recommends
www.yahooligans.com and Kids Click, a site created by librarians
(http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/kidsclick!/).
</P>
<P>
   The point is, you don't have to be powerless and you don't have
to turn to chats with rock stars to figure out what to do. Danger
may be only one click away in cyberspace, but so is a wealth of
educational experiences. Just ask NetMom. She knows.

   Liesl Clark didn't expect to be deluged with media requests when
she ascended Mount Everest to film a PBS Nova documentary. But
early this week, the team of climbers discovered the body of George
Mallory, the British adventurer who disappeared on Everest back in
1924. Word travels fast in these days of instant communication,
especially when you're chronicling your adventures on a Web site
(www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/everest/).
</P>
<P>
   ``While we were waiting at Base Camp, the climbers used their
satellite phone and laptop to announce the news to the world,''
Clark wrote in an e-mail to this column. ``Instantly, the whole
world knew... Somehow, Web-casting has taken the world by storm,
and anyone can post news, without understanding the repercussions.
While the outside world feasted on the breaking news, we were
holding on at Base Camp for the team to return, still very much in
the dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we deluged with media requests? Just about every major
magazine and newspaper has been in touch with us, asking for photos
of Mallory and doing interviews. I just got off the satellite phone
with the Sunday Times in London. I'm not so sure the media would be
quite so anxious to speak with us if we were in Boston. I can only
tell you that when I call a reporter and say, `This is Liesl Clark
calling from Everest Base Camp,' they, amazingly, don't put me on
hold.''

BOILING PROPERTIES OF WATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Why, when a metal spoon, cold or hot, is dipped into a
recently boiled cup of coffee, does the coffee start boiling again
for a moment?
</P>
<P>
   M.H.N.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Bring a cup of water to a boil, then let it set until it
stops boiling. Drop in a tea bag, and the water starts boiling
again briefly. The water should be cooler at that time. What's
going on here?
</P>
<P>
   J.R. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. This is a perfect example of the first law of thermodynamics:
nature conserves energy. Put another way, nature is efficient. It
will always use as little energy as possible, and use whatever help
it can get to do the work required.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, water can get superheated, which is hotter than
212 degrees Fahrenheit without boiling, supercooled, which is
colder than 32 degrees F without freezing, or supersaturated, which
is greater than 100 percent humidity without changing from vapor to
liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Converting matter from a solid to a liquid or from a liquid to a
gas, called a phase change, takes work. It requires energy to
rearrange the molecules. The part of that change that requires the
most energy, the part nature least likes to do, is getting the
phase transition started.
</P>
<P>
   Water is a great example. It takes a certain amount of energy to
heat water. But it takes extra energy to make the jump from one
state to another. To change water from liquid to gas requires extra
energy to get the first little bubbles going. Think of it like
pushing a car that's standing still. It takes more pushing to get
it moving, then less to keep it moving.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows that water boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit, and
freezes at 32 degrees F, right? WRONG. Those temperatures create
energy states that are just enough to get a phase change started if
efficient nature has some help. (That's where your spoon and tea
bag come in. More on that in a moment.)
</P>
<P>
   Without help, something to provide a little extra energy, the
water can get much hotter, or colder, and remain liquid. According
to Jeff Tester, Director of MIT's Energy Lab, the world record
temperature for superheated water before it boils is 535 degrees
Fahrenheit. The world record for supercooled water is 36 below
before it freezes (Both are under normal sea level atmospheric
pressure.)
</P>
<P>
   Superheating, supercooling, or supersaturation can happen when
the water molecules are very still, and very pure, without other
molecules around them. Under those conditions, nature has to do all
the work to get the phase transition started. It's like just one
person pushing the car to get it rolling.
</P>
<P>
   But nature tries to conserve energy. It will look for any help
it can get, just like we look for partners to help push the car to
get it moving. It finds that help in tiny impurities in the water,
or imperfections in the surface of whatever's holding the water,
even in just the movement of the water itself. All those things
jostle the H20 molecules just enough to release some of their
stored energy. That jump-starts the process to get the boiling
going at or near 212, and the freezing going at or near 32.
</P>
<P>
   Did you ever hear that water vapor in the air needs a speck of
dust or something to use as a nucleus around which to condense into
a raindrop? That's an example of supersaturation. The air can be at
100 percent humidity, completely water vapor, but not have liquid
rain, because it's supersaturated. The speck of dust, or wind that
bumps water molecules into each other, is enough to jostle some
stored energy out of those molecules and get the phase transition
from vapor to liquid started.
</P>
<P>
   You can see superheated water by watching a pan of water start
to boil. The bubbles start at the bottom of the pan. In part that's
because that's where the water gets hottest first. But it's also
because of microscopic imperfections in the surface of the pan.
Just before they boil, the water molecules are superheated, hotter
than 212. Those imperfections in the pan disturb the water
molecules in those spots, tapping their stored energy, helping
nature create bubbles there first.
</P>
<P>
   Now we finally get to your spoon and tea bag. The cup of water
or coffee that just stopped boiling is probably still superheated,
a few degrees hotter than 212. Ready to boil again, with a little
help. Jiggle the water molecules with your spoon, or throw in a tea
bag,and you've released some stored energy from the water
molecules, enough to get the boiling going again momentarily.

   WASHINGTON _ The United States is in an uncomfortable place in
the world this spring, not only because it is the planet's only
superpower, not only because there are rogue nations around the
globe brandishing terrifying arsenals, not only because
humanitarian crises beg for its attention and intervention, not
only because the world waits for its leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, the United States is in an uncomfortable position
because the nation _ so powerful, so prosperous, so secure _ is so
unsure about how to use its power outside its own borders. Even
with the emergence of a framework for settling the Kosovo crisis,
the question is still unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to decide this, and probably soon,'' says Michael
Klare, a military specialist at Hampshire College.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, Republicans and Democrats agree, we haven't decided.
We haven't even decided that we have to decide.
</P>
<P>
   For a whole decade, since the collapse of the communist bloc in
1989, the United States has stood alone at the apex of world
influence, occupying a position of power that, in this century, the
British, Germans, and Soviets all aspired to _ but never achieved.
And for much of that decade the debate over how to wield American
power _ a subject that dominated American civic life in the
Eisenhower and Kennedy years _ was little more than a theoretical
curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   It was conducted in graduate seminars and at resort conference
centers, but not on the campaign trail, not in the chambers of
Congress, not in coffee shops or Little League bleachers, and not
in the most rarefied reaches of the White House, State Department,
and Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish there were a prescription for this,'' says Brent L.
Scowcroft, the national security adviser to President George Bush,
``but there isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, of all the hard questions in Washington today _ how to
fix Social Security, whether to tinker with Medicare, when to raise
the minimum wage _ this may be the hardest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, answering that question would not have been
hard,'' says Francis M. Bator, a Harvard University professor of
political economy who was deputy national security adviser to
President Lyndon B. Johnson. ``There is no good general doctrine
with any bite that would help a president make these kinds of
decisions. Anyone who will lay one out to you is a bit of a fool.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a conundrum of consequence not only for the United States
but also for the world; a nation that spends more on defense than
the next 10 countries combined has the ability to impose its will
on the world if it wishes, to direct the attention of the world to
international crises if it likes, to mobilize world opinion if it
desires.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the failure to address this question is visible in the
large issues prompted by the Kosovo crisis, such as how to decide
whether to intervene in problems around the world. But it is also
evident in the smaller issues, such as how to prevail once American
interests are identified and American forces are engaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in a conflict, you want your enemy to be dead sure
of your objectives and completely unclear on your tactics,'' says
Richard Armitage, a defense official and foreign-policy negotiator
in the Reagan and Bush administrations. ``Right now the enemy is
unclear on the objectives, but they are dead sure of our tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   Stirred by the war in Yugoslavia, the unease with which
Americans watch the hopelessness of the ever-growing group of
refugees, the open-ended nature of the NATO military operation, and
the dwindling hopes for a swift solution to the problem, these
important questions are finally beginning to bubble to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``A democracy goes to war very sloppily, with all sorts of
different perspectives, depending much on the course of events,
depending in part on the security interests involved,'' says Morton
Abromowitz, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, top diplomatic thinkers say, the United
States should not plunge into military action without a consensus
on what American national interests are, how much sacrifice in
blood and treasure the nation is willing to make, how much
political support there is for intervention, and how much loss
public opinion will bear.
</P>
<P>
   But first a superpower like the United States must sort through
all the issues competing for its attention, establish its
priorities, and weigh them against its national interests.
</P>
<P>
   Though American policymakers have been chary of defining US
national interests, there is little disagreement that the United
States certainly has a stake in maintaining stable relations with
major powers, such as China and Russia; and probably has a stake in
addressing any aggression taken by rogue countries that can do a
lot of damage to the nation's geopolitical and economic security,
such as North Korea and Iraq; and might have a stake in events with
humanitarian consequences.
</P>
<P>
   It is the latter that is problematical and is causing problems
right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a country with values and TV sets, and we look at what
goes on in these places, we don't like it, and we want to stop
it,'' says Robert Zoellick, who was undersecretary of state in the
Bush administration. ``The difficulty is deciding how much we want
to pay in terms of lives and money to get involved.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why the crisis in Kosovo is so unsettling to American
policy makers. The human suffering is as obvious as it is
unbearable. It occurs in an area that may be of little consequence
to the United States but is nonetheless consequential to its
neighbors, including Greece, Turkey, Hungary, and Romania _ all
nations with longtime ties to the United States, emotional if not
political, and all nations whose stability is essential to the
overall stability of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people over there are suffering like hell, but lots of
people are suffering in the world,'' says James E. Auer, a
political scientist at Vanderbilt University. ``The president
apparently thought you could kind of get involved. You can't kind
of get involved. Vietnam should have told us that: You either
fight, or you do not fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Many times, the United States has decided not to fight.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s alone, deadly civil wars have raged throughout the
world, including two in the Horn of Africa, Sudan and Somalia; two
in central Africa, Rwanda and Burundi; two on the west coast of
Africa, Angola and Liberia; and two in Eurasia, Yugoslavia and
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Besides an intervention in Haiti, close to American shores and
American hearts, and a brief and uncomfortable foray into Somalia,
the United States has decided to intervene only in the former
Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Five years later, US
forces remain in Haiti; four years later, in Bosnia. All signs
point to an eventual long-term US presence, probably a peacekeeping
role, in Kosovo once a peace agreement is reached and ratified.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda, where at least a half-million people perished, has
provoked guilt in the American conscience, and Clinton went so far
as to apologize to the Rwandan people.

 WASHINGTON: ... Rwandan people.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The question is where you can make a positive difference,''
says Michael E. O'Hanlon, a fellow in foreign-policy studies at the
Brookings Institution, the Washington think tank. ``You can
eliminate a few easily; it would have been insanity to risk a
wide-scale war by getting involved in something so important to the
Russians as Chechnya. In some of these civil wars, you couldn't
even figure out what to do once you intervened.''
</P>
<P>
   These problems seldom affected earlier generations of Americans.
Presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson warned Americans
to avoid entangling alliances. Both warned Americans to remain free
of foreign disputes, a notion that was brought home to Jefferson in
the breach as he was dragged deeper into the Napoleonic wars that
engulfed the continent of Europe in the first decade of the 19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, however, Americans tended to their own knitting. The
United States stayed out of the Crimean War, resisted entry into
World War I until the last year of combat, was essentially a
bystander during the Spanish Civil War, and desperately tried to
avoid World War II. The United States joined the latter conflict
more than two years after it began, and then only when it became
impossible to stay out _ even though humanitarian factors not
unlike those in Yugoslavia might have provided an adequate reason
to fight.
</P>
<P>
   That all changed when the war ended, leaving Germany and Japan
all but destroyed as world military powers, the British Empire
fatally weakened, and China in turmoil. More important still, the
end of the war also left the Soviet Union empowered by its
territorial grabs in Eastern Europe and its expansionist ideology
and the United States strengthened by the economic leaps that
wartime mobilization brought to the only major combatant whose home
territory escaped damage.
</P>
<P>
   Then, despite a small remnant of isolationism, the United States
swiftly acquired a broad international role, with broad
international responsibilities. The globe was convulsed in an
ideological struggle, with capitalism and the United States
battling communism and the Soviet Union (and, after 1949, China).
Small wars were fought for big stakes in Korea, Vietnam, Central
America, the Caribbean, and central Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But the end of the Cold War in 1989 brought an end to these
regional brush fires stoked by global ideology. It ended the
artificial stability imposed on regional and ethnic warriors by the
two superpowers. It also ended the ease with which, for a brief
window in our national history, the United States decided whether
to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've historically had this problem, but it's even worse now
because of the deep ambivalence in Washington over whether the
United States should use the power it has, a power that is
indisputably the greatest power in the world,'' says Klare, the
Hampshire College specialist in military affairs. ``American
leaders, both Democrats and Republicans, are having trouble making
those decisions _ and are even having trouble deciding what is an
American interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Bator, the former Johnson adviser, believes Kosovo may offer
some hints about how to think about these questions. ``Foreign
policy has to deal with trying to use whatever influence we have to
create an environment where the United States can continue to
thrive as a disorganized, messy, decentralized, open society,'' he
says. ``That is the fundamental national interest. So this is more
than a humanitarian question. We have a stake in a decent world
order, just as the rich man with a big house on the hill has a
stake in the surrounding countryside being pretty peaceful.''
</P>
<P>
   But determining American interests is only the beginning, most
specialists agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a problem that's getting worse, you look at the
tools you have, all the way from diplomacy to the use of force,''
says Scowcroft, the Bush-era national security adviser. ``If it
comes to the possibility of force, you need to figure out whether
it will do the job. But you have to ask: How much will it take? How
much will it cost? And can you sustain the support of the American
people for doing it?
</P>
<P>
   ``And if the answers all are `yes,' he continues, ``you still
have to ask whether you can get the Americans out when it's over.
There aren't many places where the answers to all those things are
`yes.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders of both parties agree that President Clinton
has offered a rationale for US intervention in Kosovo, but no road
map for deciding whether to intervene elsewhere. Indeed, most of
his comments have been very narrowly drawn.
</P>
<P>
   To the convention of the American Federation of State, County
and Municipal Employees on March 23, he said: ``So what do we learn
from Bosnia? We learned that if you don't stand up to brutality and
the killing of innocent people, you invite the people who do it to
do more of it. We learned that firmness can save lives and stop
armies.''
</P>
<P>
   To the American Society of Newspaper Editors on April 15 he
expanded his explanation somewhat: ``We are in Kosovo because we
care about saving lives and we care about the character of the
multiethnic post-Cold-War world. We don't want young democracies
that have made the right choices to be overwhelmed by the flight of
refugees and the victories of ethnic hatred. We don't want to see
Europe re-fight with tanks and artillery the same battles they
fought centuries ago with axes and arrows. And because stability in
Europe is important to our own security, we want to build a Europe
that is peaceful, undivided, and free, a Europe where young
Americans do not have to fight and die again to deal with the
consequences of other people's madness and greed.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now Americans are fighting but not dying in Eastern
European combat, conducting an antiseptic air war that offers
Americans limited exposure to risk but also offers NATO limited
potential for success. The reason is admirable but constricting:
Clinton and his advisers will brook no large-scale American
casualties, a strategy that is derided by some of his critics but
is supported by decades of poll data.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively low number of civilian deaths seems to have kept
American concerns to a minimum over the broader costs of the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, neither the president nor the Republicans who are
eager to succeed him have engaged in a larger debate over why, and
how, the United States might get involved in world problems in this
difficult new era of American leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two questions,'' says Senator John F. Kerry, the
Massachusetts Democrat who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee. ``How should we decide? And how have we decided? At the
very least, we need very large interests at stake and a significant
amount of diplomatic effort that is finally exhausted, along with
defining the effort and educating the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the moment, we haven't gone to war,'' Kerry adds. ``That's
the anomaly. The country in no way feels it is at war, and there's
no impact here, other than budgetary, that might suggest we are at
war.''

ARE SOAPS DEAD? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sorry, 19-time nominee Susan Lucci. ``The Daytime Emmy Awards''
airs on May 21, and the favored candidate for best soap-opera
actress is Kim Zimmer from ``Guiding Light.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer, already a three-time winner, performed a beloved soap
trick last year when she played two identical characters at once.
But don't think Zimmer's double duty was for some ordinary
evil-twin plot, or for the sort of multiple-personality psychodrama
that has kept five-time winner Erika Slezak of ``One Life to Life''
busy and dizzy for decades. Zimmer became both feisty Springfield
resident Reva Shayne and a new gal in town by the name of Cleva,
who was Reva's . . . clone! Yes, thanks to the scientific ambition
of daytime TV writers, clone Cleva looked precisely like Reva right
down to the DNA _ except, of course, for that telling scar on her
arm. How can Academy voters resist those teary scenes of Cleva
dying in Reva's embrace?
</P>
<P>
   Soap operas sure aren't what they used to be. With overall soap
ratings declining about 25 percent in the 1990s, the classic
daytime genre has spent the last few years going through a peculiar
identity crisis that has reached beyond cloning to include Satanic
possession, angelic visitation, alien romance, and, thanks to some
cursed jewels, mummification. From the popular ``The Young and the
Restless'' to the struggling ``Sunset Beach,'' many of the 11 soaps
now on the air are toying with ways to attract and keep the
shrinking audience of 18-to-34-year-old women, TV viewers who spend
their nights watching ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ``The
X-Files.'' While soap honchos are honoring soap conventions _ there
are still plenty of love triangles, clingy ex-wives, and
kidnappings _ they're also working to move an old-fashioned genre
into the future, beckoning to viewers whose tastes range from MTV
to ``The Jerry Springer Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Two recent events reveal a soap world in the throes of change.
</P>
<P>
   --The biggest lather has been over the cancellation of ``Another
World,'' a 35-year-old warhorse that will offer up its final visit
to Bay City on June 25. On top in the mid-1970s, ``Another World''
has slipped to the bottom tier of the ratings, beating only ``Port
Charles'' and ``Sunset Beach.'' It generally wins less than half as
many viewers as the highly rated ``The Young and the Restless,''
which pulls in about 6 million daily _ itself not a high number
compared with ``General Hospital'' during its early-1980s heyday
(about 10 million). NBC has killed the show to make room for
``Passions,'' a new soap that NBC exec Jerry Petry has been quoted
as calling ``fresh, hip, and targeted to appeal to a younger
demo.'' Press leaks about ``Passions'' indicate a juicy paranormal
story line.
</P>
<P>
   --ABC and Disney announced the creation of a 24-hour soap cable
channel, to debut in January. The as-yet-unnamed channel will
re-air the ABC soap lineup in prime time on the same day of its
afternoon airing. While this move threatens to lower the daytime
ratings of ABC affiliates, it could regenerate interest in soaps by
making them more readily available to 9-to-5 workers who don't like
to tape. It won't be much of a leap from ``Dawson's Creek'' to
``General Hospital.'' As network TV in general loses ratings ground
to cable options, this move could put the soap back on people's
screens.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Soaps scooped
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How has TV's quintessential form become its most forgotten and
endangered one? The short answer is that TV and real life have
scooped the soap opera. All the defining qualities of soaps can now
be found elsewhere, on nighttime TV from ``ER'' to ``Ally McBeal,''
on tabloid talk shows and tabloid news shows, and even in the Starr
Report, whose finely detailed approach to the Lewinsky-Clinton
affair almost matched the soap opera's ability to mimic real time.
The qualities that once made soap operas unique _ the continuing
story lines, the garish romantic liaisons, the catfighting and
backbiting and murder trials _ have filtered into other areas of
American culture.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious blow to the soaps has been nighttime's
obsession with ongoing plots. Ever since they were invented to hawk
detergent to housewives on the radio and then on TV, daytime soaps
have relied on the lure of story, on the hypnotic power of endless
narratives. By offering a keyhole view of other people's lives,
soaps became _ to the joy of companies like Procter &AMP; Gamble _
addictive. They were the original ``appointment television,'' long
before NBC solidified the concept with its ``must see'' campaign.
Loyal soap viewers are famous for scheduling their days around
visits with their TV ``family.'' An Internet tour of ``Another
World'' sites reveals a community of fans who are devastated and
angry that their story is ending, and there are even mentions of
boycotting NBC during sweeps month and ``Passions'' when it
premieres on July 5.
</P>
<P>
   The soap magazines _ including Soap Opera Digest, Soap Opera
Update, and Soap Opera Weekly _ do acknowledge the weekly nighttime
series that are overtly soapy, including ``Party of Five,''
``Beverly Hills 90210,'' ``Felicity,'' ``Dawson's Creek,'' and
``Melrose Place.'' But they don't cover those nighttime series that
aren't soaps but that are quite soaplike, including ``Providence,''
``ER,'' ``Ally McBeal,'' and ``The Practice.'' Even today's sitcoms
have narrative arcs, most of them involving attractions between
central characters like Ross and Rachel or Monica and Chandler on
``Friends,'' or Maya and Elliott on ``Just Shoot Me,'' or Dana and
Casey on ``Sports Night.'' Last year's heavy-breathing death of
Jimmy Smits's character on ``NYPD Blue'' was elongated and
melodramatic enough to make even the most conventional daytime soap
green with envy.
</P>
<P>
   The tabloid talk and news shows, too, have stolen the soaps'
thunder. They've grabbed viewers by zeroing in on the sorts of
lurid tales that were once exclusive to soap operas _ domestic
distortions like adultery and incest and ``women who love men who
love other women who love other men.'' A recent Springer episode,
for instance, featured a screamfest called ``Attack of the
Homewreckers'' that made years of classic soap vixenhood look
boring. The tab shows are upping the ante on the soaps' ability to
exploit viewers' fantasies and fears. Both the denizens of
Springer-land and the residents of Llanview and Port Charles have
bizarre problems we don't want, from evil twins to artificial
insemination by the wrong sperm. But they also represent our secret
longings unleashed, ranging from extramarital sex and financial
greed to conniving and backstabbing.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just tab TV that's competing with soaps. The
tabloiding of American culture in general seems to hand us a glitzy
new national soap opera every week. These scandalous dramas
penetrate newspapers and magazines as well as TV, and they've
become the hot ``water cooler'' topics. The most obvious one is the
Clinton-Lewinsky affair, but the decade's lineup of public soaps
ranges from the trashy violence of Amy Fisher and Joey Buttafuoco
and Lorena and John Wayne Bobbitt to the celebrity indiscretions of
Woody Allen and Mia Farrow and Michael Jackson. Even tragedies like
the murders of Ron Goldman, Nicole Simpson, and JonBenet Ramsey and
the death of Princess Diana have become our ``stories,'' some of
them rich in the kind of murder subplots and secondary characters
(Kato Kaelin) and moving eulogies (Earl Spencer) and hair changes
(Linda Tripp) that soaps have thrived on. Next to these real-life
soaps, Lucky's ``death'' on ``General Hospital'' (like his mother,
father, and grandmother before him, Lucky's not really dead) seems
less operatic.
</P>
<P>
   It was a telling moment when ``Sunset Beach'' recently tried to
steal some ratings with a guest visit from tabloid overlord Jerry
Springer. And it wasn't entirely absurd when a rumor in the soap
world had ``Sunset Beach,'' which is produced by Aaron Spelling,
negotiating with an up-and-coming celebrity named Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The young and the rest
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As they make a home for themselves in this new landscape, many
of the soap operas are trying to ``youthify,'' like so many other
mediums. That has certainly happened at the movies, where the
country's huge teenage population has created a boom in
teen-oriented fare, most recently with ``Varsity Blues,'' ``She's
All That,'' and ``The Matrix.'' Prime-time TV is also famous for
downplaying older-skewing shows like ``Touched by an Angel'' in
order to lavish promotion on the likes of ``Ally McBeal'' and
``Friends,'' whose young demographic makes advertisers drool.
</P>
<P>
   Soaps, like teen movies and WB series, have soundtracks with
songs by youth-market artists like the Goo Goo Dolls (``One Life to
Live'') and Monica (``As the World Turns'' and ``Guiding Light'').
The stately, adult-sounding series titles like ``As the World
Turns'' are being replaced with steamier titles that connote more
explicit, up-to-date story lines like those of ``Passions.'' And
younger characters have gained more air time on some shows, as
long-lost siblings and children turn up out of the blue. Actor Jay
Hammer claims that he was fired from his 14-year-long role as
Fletcher Reade on ``Guiding Light'' in 1998 because of his age and
the emphasis on younger, hunkier (and less expensive) actors.
(Hammer returned to the show in March, with a short-term contract.)
</P>
<P>
   With the coming of ``Passions,'' the writing is on the wall.
When NBC decided to premiere the new series, it was clear that one
of the network's other soaps would have to be cut. But while
``Sunset Beach'' is the lowest-rated soap, the network chose to
pull the plug on the older ``Another World'' and give ``Sunset'' a
six-month extension. Partly, that was because NBC wants
``Passions'' to follow ``Days of Our Lives'' in the schedule, but
in Daily Variety, NBC entertainment president Scott Sassa also
pointed to the youth market: ` ``Sunset Beach' seemed to have more
momentum with younger viewers, so we went with it.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the soaps will continue to ply their fantasies. But the
fantasies may become more fantastic, the pretty people may become
prettier, and the shiny hair may become shinier. There will always
be enough illness and murder and amnesia and facial disfigurement
to keep a fictional town in melodramatic heaven and hell. But
behind that finely plucked eyebrow that arches ever so slightly
before the scene fades to commercial, you may find yourself
wondering if someone has neatly implanted a computer microchip.

   BOSTON -- Jo Dee Messina is singing. This is something she does
well, and often, in front of thousands of people at sprawling
venues. Today, however, she is performing an impromptu concert for
an audience of two, sprawled in the back of a limousine in tight
black jeans, tall black boots, and a little white T-shirt. We are
stuck in traffic _ the country star, a management rep, and the
reporter _ en route to a radio station, and Messina is caterwauling
an improvisational tribute to the T. She croons about the Green
Line and the Red Line, then segues into a riff about the fabulous
new lipstick color she's found. Messina pulls down the visor and
applies a fresh coat. It's pale brown, a muted complement to her
cascade of red locks. ``Maybe I'll wear this tonight. I just
might,'' she says, inspecting her glossy mouth in the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;

</P>
<P>
   Colorful she is. Messina, a Massachusetts native, Nashville
transplant, and chart-topping darling of country music, was in town
to perform at last month's Kahlua Boston Music Awards at the
Orpheum Theatre. Although she didn't know it yet _ ``I'm gonna be
the Susan Lucci of these awards,'' Messina kept muttering
throughout the day _ she would pick up three awards, including one
for best act of the year. That's no small feat for a country singer
in a rock town. But Messina is no stranger to beating the odds.
</P>
<P>
   The last three years have been a bizarre roller-coaster ride for
Messina, beginning with her self-titled debut album in 1996 that
produced two Top 10 country hits: ``Heads Carolina, Tails
California'' and ``You're Not in Kansas Anymore.'' While the
singles sailed to the top of the charts, the album didn't. The
third single stiffed. Recording a follow-up album turned out to be
a nightmare. Everything from song selection to recording sessions
stalled repeatedly, ultimately delaying the release of ``I'm
Alright'' for more than a year. Messina's debts mounted. Christmas
of 1997, she didn't turn on the holiday lights in order to save on
her electric bill. Her accountants and attorneys advised her to
file for bankruptcy. Messina couldn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us forever to make that second record, and then we'd
been off the radio for about a year, and I pretty much lost
everything I owned,'' Messina states succinctly, over lunch at the
Omni Parker House, before heading to the radio station. She's
supremely composed, verging on sedate, and not at all the outgoing
firebrand one expects from reading articles written about her. It's
the combined effects of a red-eye from Nashville and her pre-6 p.m.
personality, Messina explains, venturing a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Things got so bad she couldn't make her house or car payments,
Messina recounts between bites of salad. But quitting _ that's what
bankruptcy court would have meant to her _ wasn't an option. By
early 1998, the papers were drawn up and ready to sign. ``I just
refused. The label'' _ Nashville-based Curb Records _ ``covered
some of my bills, and a trucking company came in from out of the
blue and asked me to be their spokesperson and that gave me enough
money to float for a few months,'' she says. ``The next thing I
knew, the first single from `I'm Alright' came out, and now here I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   Where she is now is making history, as the first female country
artist ever to have three consecutive, multi-week No. 1 hits on
Billboard's Hot Country Singles charts. ``I'm Alright'' was finally
released in March of last year, and it has catapulted 28-year-old
Messina into the upper echelons of the country music elite. The
title track, ``Bye Bye,'' and ``Stand Beside Me'' have all reached
the top of the charts. On April 28, ``I'm Alright,'' which is
currently No. 8 on Billboard's Country Album charts, was certified
platinum, signifying sales of more than 1 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, Messina won Best New Female Vocalist at the
Academy of Country Music Awards; she received a standing ovation
from industry folks who well know how hard she's fought. Speaking
by cell phone from the press area backstage at LA's Universal
Amphitheatre, a teary, elated Messina said, ``My head is still
spinning. It's been a long road, and I've been praying so hard. I
feel so, so lucky.'' With hardly a moment to catch her breath,
Messina will hit the road with George Strait.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, when we finally arrive at WKLB (99.5) that
afternoon, Messina is treated like royalty. Although management is
beginning to sweat as the split-second-timed schedule for the day
unravels at the first stop, Messina is emerging from the cloud of
fatigue that has kept her mood and manner low-key so far.
Computerized screens in the main lobby of the Greater Boston Radio
Group flash her picture and a personalized welcome message. Radio
staff and unidentified hangers-on seem to crawl from the woodwork
to greet her. There's a big white cake with her name on it in the
sound booth, and much photo snapping and autograph signing. Messina
squeals her delight off and on the air, her famous effervescence
bubbling up to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Messina's 20 minutes on the radio are filled with big raspy
laughs and spontaneous, gleeful hand clapping. She cackles
hysterically over the fact that the jewel box for her latest
single, ``Lesson in Leaving,'' got her name wrong, and coyly looses
bits of juicy Jo Dee gossip. Randy Travis was her first country
crush. She's dating a guy in Nashville _ no, he's not in the
business. For her acting debut on ``Nash Bridges,'' Messina
declined the first role they offered her _ a pistol-wielding mama,
as she describes it _ because she didn't feel right playing such a
harsh character. She wound up playing a country singer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A country singer, after all, is the only thing Jo Dee Messina
has ever really wanted to be. She took to the stage at the tender
age of 13, singing in various local bands with the remarkable
support of her mother, Mary, who was then raising Jo Dee and her
three older siblings as a single parent. Mary would chaperone her
youngest daughter in the nightclubs until 1 a.m. and then rise at 5
to go to work at Raytheon. ``My mom worked and then put herself
through school and she still loved us like we were the prince and
princesses of her life,'' Messina recalls, leaning in close, her
gratitude and admiration fierce. ``And we were.''
</P>
<P>
   When she turned 16, Messina formed the Jo Dee Messina Band _ ``I
already had a following, and we wanted people to connect my name
with the new band'' _ with her brother on drums and a sister on
bass. Their sets were packed with Reba McIntyre and Juice Newton
tunes, Lorrie Morgan and Patsy Cline music. Aside from the
occasional Bob Seger rocker, it was country music through and
through. Ginny Rogers, music director at WKLB, was the midday host
on WBOS in the mid-'80s, when it was a country station.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to introduce the Jo Dee Messina Band at club nights
back then,'' Rogers recalls. ``You could just tell she was one of
the few that had a real chance at making it.'' Today, Rogers says,
``Jo Dee is definitely on her way to becoming a superstar act. She
has the talent and the personality, and with this album she has the
momentum to keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   Messina remembers the early years with a mixture of fondness and
exasperation. ``We used to play JR's Place in Beverly, Sacco's in
Watertown, the Adelphia in Dorchester. I remember performing at a
place in Lawrence for a guy that was screaming at himself and a
woman that was dancing with a Miss Piggy doll,'' she recounts,
shaking her head. ``That was it, and we played for five hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted by the rigors of club life and unabashedly driven,
Messina at age 19 struck out for Nashville in 1989 to try her luck
in the country music capital. ``When I packed up and left, people
said `Oh, Nashville, they won't have anything to do with you.'
Because I was a Northerner. `We'll see you in six months,' they
said. But once I got down there no one even asked where I was from.
It wasn't an issue. It's always been about the music.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years, countless temp jobs, and one failed record contract
later, then-fledgling producer Byron Gallimore walked into her
life.

   Civil defense officials in Japan should soon get advance warning
of tsunamis, the giant waves that can wreak havoc when they hit the
coast. A new alerting system uses Global Positioning System
navigation satellites to monitor the vertical motion of a buoy
moored out in the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Tsunamis are caused by submarine earthquakes, landslips or
volcanic activity. In Japan, tsunamis are considered almost as big
a threat as earthquakes on land. A powerful earthquake 100 miles
off the coast of Chile in 1960 caused a tsunami that inundated the
Japanese coastline, killing 119.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the only way to predict these waves has been to
monitor distant earthquakes and guess the likely speed, size and
direction of any tsunami they might produce. But this is fraught
with errors caused by unknown variables such as the topography of
the seabed. ``The idea of using a buoy may seem obvious, but it has
only been made possible because of recent advances in GPS
technology,'' says Teruyuki Kato of Tokyo University's Earthquake
Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The 24 satellites that make up the GPS network are arranged so
that at least three of them are always in view from a receiver
anywhere on the Earth's surface. The satellites transmit precise
time signals, and receivers calculate their position by decoding
the differences in the signals from three or more satellites. In
this way the buoy's GPS receiver can measure its vertical movement
to an accuracy of just a few centimeters.
</P>
<P>
   Kato says it isn't hard to distinguish tsunamis from normal
waves, as the former have much longer wavelengths. The ERI is now
testing the system off the coast of the Miura peninsular, southwest
of Tokyo. &QL;

   Free Web-based e-mail services are vulnerable to hackers,
according to an analysis by the Internet Security Advisors Group, a
consultancy in Severna Park, Md.
</P>
<P>
   In its security probe, ISAG focused on the three biggest and
most firmly established Web-based free e-mail services: Microsoft's
Hotmail, YahooMail and Excite Mail. It found that all three failed
to provide a basic security feature that helps keep hackers out.
</P>
<P>
   The major mistake made by all the service providers was to allow
users an unlimited number of attempts to log on, rather than
locking them out after a couple of attempts if they got the
password wrong.
</P>
<P>
   This, says Ira Winkler, president of ISAG, makes it possible for
hackers to guess a password by brute force _ using what is known as
an automated dictionary attack, which tries vast numbers of
different passwords until the correct one is found.
</P>
<P>
   This, Winkler says, is a basic information security issue the
service providers should have got right. In addition, ISAG found
that many Web-based e-mail systems also fail to encrypt their
passwords when they are sent over the Net, making them easy prey
for hackers to intercept. Some hackers collect passwords, logging
into e-mail accounts and sending bogus messages.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Hotmail tightened its security in response to ISAG's
findings. Its log-in protocol now incorporates a slight delay when
the password is entered. For each wrong attempt the delay
increases, making any automated attack take an unfeasibly long
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no impact on members who log in successfully,'' says
Laura Norman, a project manager at Hotmail, ``but this should deter
potential dictionary attacks.'' Yahoo has also made changes to its
password security system, and Excite is believed to be considering
the matter. &QL;

   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ At the last count, there were 191 members of the
House of Representatives all committed on paper to forcing campaign
finance reform legislation onto the floor for that simple act the
moneyed interests fear most _ a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the cause, every one is a Democrat (not
counting Vermont independent Bernie Sanders), which means that once
again where a major issue is concerned, one key to the outcome will
be how certain kinds of Democrats and certain kinds of Republicans
deal with each other. And in this case, that means the largest
share of the work across the aisle will have to be done by
Representative Marty Meehan of Massachusetts, Democratic chief
sponsor of reform and ally of the Republican chief sponsor, Chris
Shays of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   It is tough, grinding work, building a case for a member of the
other party to take a position against his leadership on an issue
that concerns the very business of getting elected. In this
situation, Meehan needs to find 26 GOP members.

   In the end, though, Meehan is likely to find the GOP allies his
cause requires _ either for a petition forcing a vote or for
persuading the GOP leadership to allow one, rather than be forced
to. One reason he's likely to be successful is that he's been
successful before (last year 61 Republicans in the House made the
Shays-Meehan legislation legitimately bipartisan).
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, as campaign finance reform was beginning to
come to a head in the House last week, Meehan at last got off his
duff and quietly announced _ via a letter sent to every household
in his district _ that he is in fact running for a fifth term next
year.
</P>
<P>
   No big deal under normal circumstances, except that Meehan is
the only Democrat trapped by a pledge made years earlier in support
of the moribund term-limits movement. For a spell early in his
career here, he did talk some of the talk and walked some of the
walk, though he has never resembled the fanatics who came along two
years later as part of Newt Gingrich's revolution-that-wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, what he has done as a congressman belies his earlier
stance and underlines the overriding need for veterans here in an
era when problem-solving has eclipsed crusading as the major job
requirement. Seniority per se is not the point; mere length of
service doesn't count for much anymore, but what does is the
ability to work across the aisle at a time when no matter which
party is in the majority, its margin is not going to be large
enough to govern without the other party's help and therefore input
on major issues.
</P>
<P>
   That's true about all the big entitlement programs from Social
Security to Medicare; it's true about regulating HMOs; it's true
about the next step in the tobacco wars; and it has always been
true about campaign finance reform in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan, in fact, was a part of the realistic efforts to effect
change from almost the beginning. After Bill Clinton's election in
1992, the stalemate on this issue was framed not just by
conservative intransigence on behalf of the big-money status quo
but also by liberal Democratic proposals to regulate federal
elections in excruciating detail and to introduce public financing.
The only hope for bipartisanship was to focus on eliminating the
most egregious abuses _ above all, the unregulated cash called soft
money and the phony ``issue'' ads that special interests finance.
</P>
<P>
   Those ideas remain at the core of the Shays-Meehan legislation
in the House and of the counterpart being pushed in the Senate by
Republican John McCain of Arizona and Democrat Russ Feingold of
Wisconsin. The Republicans Meehan will recruit to help put the heat
on Speaker Denny Hestert to schedule a vote can trust him to keep
the Democrats' end of the bargain.
</P>
<P>
   When Meehan ran in '92, it was the time not only of Bill
Clinton's moderating influence on the Democratic Party, but of Ross
Perot's healthy bucket of cold water on traditional politics.
Before Perot undercut his own movement via personal antics, it had
made several major contributions to the political atmosphere with
its emphasis on sane budget policy, problem-solving, and clean
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Term limits were in the mix back then, but over time that hot
button's temperature has cooled, for all the right reasons. Ability
is what counts, which is why decisions by people like Meehan to
stick around will be welcomed far more than condemned.

AIDAN QUINN CELEBRATES HIS FAMILY STORY IN `THIS IS MY FATHER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What would become Aidan Quinn's latest film began as a story
told by a mother to her sons, a tale from the old country about
love, a widow, a curse, and a coffin laid at the widow's gate. That
yarn, from their mother's native Ireland, involved the brothers'
grandfather, one of the pallbearers who placed that coffin down on
ground forever damned.
</P>
<P>
   When Quinn's brother Paul traveled to Ireland to flesh out the
story, he found very little information. Undeterred, he took the
threads of his mother's story and wove them into ``This Is My
Father,'' a film written and directed by Paul, and starring Aidan.
</P>
<P>
   Set in Ireland, and told mostly in flashbacks, it's a story of
love lost and love found, the latter between a middle-aged Chicago
schoolteacher (played by James Caan) and the father he never knew
(Quinn).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's primarily a love story, but it's informed by the search
for family, and the search for your roots. It all really goes back
to `Roots' and (Alex) Haley, and Frank McCourt with `Angela's
Ashes.' It's out of that same tradition,'' says Quinn. ``James
Caan's character needs to know who his ancestors were, who his
father was, who his family is, hoping that will make him better
understand who he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Opening Friday, the film also stars Moya Farrelly, Gina Moxley,
Jacob Tierney, and Colm Meaney.
</P>
<P>
   This film about family marks the first time Quinn has worked
with his younger brother, Paul, and his older brother, Declan, an
award-winning cinematographer who has shot such films as ``Leaving
Las Vegas,'' ``One True Thing,'' and ``Vanya on 42nd Street.'' All
three brothers also served as executive producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as though we don't irritate each other, as all
siblings do,'' Quinn said. ``But we are really good friends, and we
share a sense of humor, and a lot of other sensibilities. Plus,
there really wasn't a lot of time for petty squabbles; we were
working way too hard. We had a gargantuan thing in front of us that
we wanted to accomplish, and a small budget, and a small amount of
time to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers also share an intense love of Ireland, where much
of the film was shot. Making the film there was easier than getting
the details on the true story that inspired it. Quinn said his
brother Paul ``met a stone wall of silence, with people telling
him, `Don't be bringin' that up, leave the dead good enough buried,
leave the dead where they belong.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So he just made it up,'' he said, ``and wrote this
staggeringly beautiful script.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Quinn's third film set in Ireland _ the other two are
``The Playboys'' and ``Michael Collins.'' Unlike that latter film,
and others such as ``In the Name of the Father,'' ``Some Mother's
Son,'' and ``The Boxer,'' ``This Is My Father'' has nothing to do
with the Irish Republican Army or ``the Troubles'' in Northern
Ireland. For Quinn, it was important to show another side of his
ancestral homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IRA and the Troubles have very little to do with most
people's daily lives in Ireland. It's not a huge subject matter,''
he said. ``This story had nothing to do with that, and it wouldn't
have been appropriate to include it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An occasional home
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though born and raised in Chicago, Quinn is fiercely protective
of Ireland, where he has lived for several periods throughout his
life. His family returned there twice during his childhood, and
Quinn also spent summers there.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we moved there as kids, people would say, `Be safe, don't
get shot.' People had no idea that the violence rate was so
incredibly low. There are no guns, except from the IRA and a few
criminals,'' he said. ``But growing up, we had no access to guns.
There might be huge horrible fights, and maybe knives, but Chicago
was way more scary than anything there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love being back there, I love working there, I love
reconnecting there,'' he said. ``Being back there I feel very
comfortable. I love the sense of humor. And I love the Guinness _
it tastes better there.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all his love of the Emerald Isle, Quinn said, he and his
brothers did not want to ``look through a glass at the Irish
romantically'' because ``that's not the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Irish are bitter, jealous, spiteful _ and I'm talking
about myself, I'm talking about our character. We are famous back
stabbers,'' he said. ``But we're also incredibly joyful,
courageous, generous, emotional _ we cry at the drop of a hat.
We're very conservative people, and yet we love wildness above all
things. It's a real paradox, a sort of schizophrenic identity, and
I think it's from trying to hang on to the Celtic stuff amongst
being conquered.''
</P>
<P>
   As passionate as he is about Ireland, Quinn displayed equal
fervor in discussing his career. After his debut in 1984's
``Reckless,'' he gained notice in the landmark 1985 television film
``An Early Frost,'' the first Hollywood production to deal with
AIDS. Quinn played a young gay man faced with revealing his
sexuality to his family after he became sick. Then, he costarred as
Rosanna Arquette's boyfriend in the sleeper hit ``Desperately
Seeking Susan,'' which also starred Madonna. Some predicted Quinn,
with his soulful blue eyes and dark Irish good looks, would be a
major star.
</P>
<P>
   But it hasn't happened. He was upstaged by Brad Pitt's hair in
``Legends of the Fall.'' He gave solid performances in ``Avalon''
and ``The Playboys,'' but they withered at the box office. There
have been out-and-out flops like the recent ``In Dreams,'' although
he was fortunate enough to be have been bludgeoned to death about
halfway through the film.
</P>
<P>
   While his pal and ``Michael Collins'' costar Liam Neeson will
soon be seen in ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,''
Quinn has never broken out as an A-list star, the kind who gets the
scripts without fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lack of risk taking
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say there's probably no less imaginative group of
men running companies than those running movie companies,'' he
said. ``They've made this decision that there's these 10 or 12
people they can cast in a movie, and you can't cast anyone else.
There's so little risk taking they shoot themselves in the foot
because people get bored. And when these movies bomb, then they get
desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the Four Seasons Hotel, Quinn, 40, sounded more like
a cranky critic than an actor who just completed the big Hollywood
film ``50 Violins,'' starring Meryl Streep, and has worked with
such acclaimed directors as Barry Levinson, Hector Babenco, and
Neil Jordan. Still, in an industry where most are too afraid to
even think critical thoughts, let alone utter one, Quinn's honesty
was surprising and refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People meet me on the streets and say, `Why aren't you doing
more stuff or better stuff?' '' Quinn said. `` `The Assignment' (a
twisty, little-seen 1997 thriller) and `This Is My Father' are the
two best roles I've had in maybe 10 years. It's a little
disconcerting. I'll do a decent role, a supporting role, which I
don't mind doing so long as with the next role I'm challenged.''
</P>
<P>
   In producing, Quinn said, he can create the ``great roles''
Hollywood seems to deny him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (producing) was inevitable because of the frustration
from the lack of challenging roles one gets offered through the
Hollywood studio system,'' he said. ``A lot of my friends are
realizing you have to produce or create your own work. It's a
really good trend, born of frustration.''

   Women who snore when they are pregnant may be at risk of
developing dangerously high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Around 10 percent of pregnant women suffer from pre-eclampsia,
in which high blood pressure can lead to injury or even death in
the mother and the fetus. Women can try to reduce their blood
pressure by resting or with medication. But drugs may put the fetus
at risk, and sometimes even the maximum dose fails to get blood
pressure down.
</P>
<P>
   Breathing problems that cause snoring may be a risk factor, Karl
Franklin of Ume University in Sweden told a meeting of the American
Lung Association in San Diego last week. He and his colleagues
discovered this when they gave questionnaires to 502 pregnant
women.
</P>
<P>
   While only 4 percent reported frequent snoring before pregnancy,
23 percent snored by the end of their pregnancies. Around 10
percent of the snoring women had pre-eclampsia, while only 4
percent of nonsnorers developed the condition. All patients with
pre-eclampsia started snoring before any hint of pre-eclampsia such
as blurred vision appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Similar findings came from Natalie Edwards and her colleagues at
the University of Sydney. They looked at 32 women with severe
pre-eclampsia and 40 with normal pregnancies and found that all the
women with pre-eclampsia were snorers. Women with the highest
degree of airway obstruction during sleep also had the highest
blood pressures.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian researchers found that they could prevent both
the snoring and the high blood pressure by giving women breathing
masks attached to a machine that kept their airways open while they
were asleep. ``All of the obstetricians were impressed that we
could control this so effectively,'' Edwards says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept is very intriguing,'' says James Van Hook at the
University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. ``This may be an
important phenomenon that causes their condition to get worse.'' He
hopes to collaborate on larger clinical trials of the breathing
masks. &QL;   &UR; (This article is excerpted from New Scientist, a weekly

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; !!! &LR;  ``Dry Cleaning'' In this lethal French comedy, a bisexual
interloper moves in on a bored couple running a dry-cleaning shop,
only to discover that he's not as tough and they're not as timid as
he had supposed. Subtle performances and invigorating risk-taking
by the actors, especially Miou-Miou as the emergent adventuress and
Charles Berling as the seemingly prissy spot remover. (French with
subtitles) (Unrated) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
(FL)  &UR; !!!! &LR;  ``Election'' The sharpest and darkest comedy of the new
year so far is set in a high school where a ruthless little
overachiever (Reese Witherspoon) hits back hard at an earnest but
unequipped civics teacher (Matthew Broderick), who talks a popular
jock into running against her for student council president. A
worthy follow-up to Alexander Payne's debut film, the abortion
satire ``Citizen Ruth.'' (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !! &LR;  ``The Empty Mirror'' What's empty here is this film's lame
fantasy that imagines Hitler's last hours in his bunker as a
rantfest that tells us nothing we didn't already know. Despite a
brave performance by Norman Rodway, the fictionalized film is blown
off the screen by actual newsreel footage, Eva Braun's home movies,
and Leni Riefenstahl's documentary, ``The Triumph of the Will.''
(Unrated) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !!! &LR;  1/2 ``Lovers of the Arctic Circle'' A wildly romantic yet
intricately patterned love story with a philosophical dimension.
The movie asks whether it's fate or chance that forges a bond
between a schoolboy and schoolgirl that persists for 25 years
despite a lot of missed connections. Few films make the connection
between love and geography _ including the geography of the human
heart _ that gifted Spanish filmmaker Julio Medem does here.
(Spanish with subtitles) (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
(FR)  &UR; !! &LR;  ``The Mummy'' Better they should have stuck with the
rotting-gauze look of the Boris Karloff original, rather than make
a whizbang computer-generated successor that's more campy and funny
than scary and moody. The been-there-done-that flavor extends to
Brendan Fraser's desert swashbuckler, too. He seems haunted more by
Indiana Jones than by the mummy. (PG-13) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !! &LR;  1/2 ``SLC Punk!'' It's life amongst the glorious ruins, early
in the Reagan era, for a couple of semi-righteous, semi-messed-up
punk-rock pals in Salt Lake City. Director James Merendino has an
eye for detail, nuance, and irony _ this doesn't feel like one of
those groaner youth movies made by ``adults.'' On the other hand,
the plot mostly consists of posturing, partying, and fighting, so a
certain tedium sets in, too. But the soundtrack rocks, the kids'
issues seem as big as they feel at that age, and the writers avoid
cheap moralizing. (R) (Jim Sullivan) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !!! &LR;  1/2 ``The Winslow Boy'' David Mamet, known for his American
lowlifes, triumphantly breaks out of writer's typecasting with this
sterling adaptation of Terence Rattigan's Edwardian period piece of
a play. There's a somber atmosphere, sustained tension, and a
screenful of rich performances in this intimate drama about a boy
whose respectable middle-class family risks everything to clear him
of a charge of petty theft. (G) &QL;

SPECIAL SESSION A POLITICAL GAMBLE FOR BUSH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ One of the Texas governor's strongest weapons in
a relatively weak arsenal is the power to call special sessions of
the Legislature and set their agendas. So it is not much of a
surprise that rumors of an extra session have been flying
throughout the Capitol as legislators continue to resist Gov.
George W. Bush's tax cut priorities.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to try to predict how all the speculation will
play out. But Bush, who has never called a special session, surely
is aware that this same weapon, if not handled with great care, may
end up shooting him in the foot _ or worse.
</P>
<P>
   Taking liberties with the legendary former University of Texas
football coach Darrell Royal's famous quote about his aversion to
the passing game: A lot of things can happen to a governor during a
special session, and many of them are bad.
</P>
<P>
   In the pre-Bush years, special sessions were almost as frequent
as the rumors. The governor's three predecessors faced serious
budgetary problems that required several tax increases and often
sparked intense fights between Democrats and growing numbers of
Republican lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's situation is markedly different. He is trying to cut
taxes during a time of budgetary surplus, and, of course, he may be
running for president. And those two factors are not unrelated.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has proposed tax cuts totaling about $2.6 billion,
including $2 billion in school tax relief. But many lawmakers,
Republicans as well as Democrats, are insisting that most of that
money be spent on public education, particularly raises for Texas'
underpaid teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The governor isn't saying whether he would call legislators back
for another session this summer if they fail to provide what he
would consider sufficient tax relief before the regular session
ends on Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   But he may be tempted to do so, partly to counter criticism that
his leadership has faltered this year and partly to add to his
anti-tax credentials, which were left open to potential attack
after the 1997 session.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature cut school property taxes by $1 billion two
years ago at Bush's bidding. But the governor may be vulnerable on
the tax issue because he also proposed a controversial sales tax
increase and a new business tax as part of an unsuccessful tax
trade-off.
</P>
<P>
   Should Bush choose to delay or interrupt his national
campaigning this summer to call a special session, he could luck
out and convince lawmakers to cut taxes enough for him to declare
victory. Those prospects would be enhanced if Comptroller Carole
Keeton Rylander, a fellow Republican, were to find some additional
state money and increase the revenue projection that determines how
large a budget or how deep a tax cut lawmakers can afford.
</P>
<P>
   Previous comptrollers have produced rosier-than-anticipated
revenue updates to bail previous governors and Legislatures out of
late-session budgetary jams, but, so far, Rylander isn't making any
promises, at least publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Without Rylander's help, the bottom-line budget numbers won't
change. And without better numbers, Bush may be no more persuasive
with lawmakers in a 30-day special session than he has been during
the 140-day regular session.
</P>
<P>
   Partisanship also could become a greater factor during a hot,
summer session. With Democrats holding a majority of the House and
15 of the Senate's 31 votes, Bush will need their help, and they
may not be willing to boost the governor's political aspirations at
the expense of teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The governor would have a few hammers to use during a special
session. If an extra session were held in June, he could threaten
uncooperative lawmakers with vetoes of still-unsigned bills that
they passed during the special session. And he could try to woo
some tax-cut votes by promising legislators to add their pet bills
_ those they didn't get passed during the regular session _ to the
special session's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Although a special session could project Bush as a leader
determined to force lawmakers to do his bidding, it also could help
the governor fall flat on his face in full view of the national
media, a decidedly unflattering position for someone who would be
president.
</P>
<P>
   The special session speculation will continue and may soon be
broadened to include the bill requiring parents to be notified
before their minor daughters can have abortions. That measure,
which also could be of huge political importance to Bush in
Republican presidential primaries, hasn't emerged from the
legislative mine field yet, and time is ticking away.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the issue, though, a special session for a governor is
at best a calculated risk. At worst, it can be an irresponsible
roll of the dice.

LACK OF CREWS, SUPPLIES MAY SLOW REBUILDING IN OKLAHOMA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PETE ALFANO 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOORE, Okla. _ Like many of his fellow residents near Sunrise
Drive and Northwest 21st Street, a quiet neighborhood that no
longer exists, Jody Alexander sifted through the debris where his
house once stood, searching for any personal belongings that would
make it easier for his family to start life over again.
</P>
<P>
   This neighborhood of working-class people was leveled by the
tornado that struck May 3. By midweek, homeowners were marking
their turf, spray-painting their addresses and the names of their
insurance company on their driveways or the walls of their homes,
if any remained. A few had even planted American flags in the
rubble, giving the quiet streets the look of a battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, who is 28 and delivers vending machines for
Coca-Cola, isn't as fortunate as many of his neighbors. He doesn't
have homeowner's insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let my homeowner's lapse, and I don't really know why,''
Alexander said. ``We were saving money to go on vacation, and I was
thinking that when we got back, I'd get insurance again.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been eight days since the killer tornadoes struck, and
for those left homeless, everyday life is temporarily on hold. As
the massive cleanup begins in earnest, even those with insurance
may find that going home will take longer than they expect.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's mayor, Glenn Lewis, estimated that rebuilding could take
from six months to a year. Almost a quarter of the 15,000 houses in
the town were destroyed. Hundreds more were damaged but are
habitable, according to local police.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor's prediction may be optimistic. The irony is that
a strong economy and a construction boom have created a shortage of
building materials and construction crews throughout the country.
Supply cannot meet demand, and that is driving up prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sheetrock shortage and brick shortage,'' said L.O.
Harrington, a home builder and insurance agent in Moore. ``It's
frustrating, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shock is just hitting. Builders won't be able to get
subcontractors to rebuild homes because these people can make more
money repairing homes than working on new ones. I'm not sure what
the bigger problem is,'' Harrington said, ``a lack of materials or
workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Hap Lowry of Trinity Brick, an Oklahoma City distributor, said
that the tunnel kilns that produce brick are running at full
capacity 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. ``They can produce only
so many bricks a day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm also wondering whether they're going to make it a priority
for people who lost their homes to get brick first or for those who
are having homes built and have been waiting for two or three
months,'' Lowry said.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Feuerborn, co-owner of Blanchard Building Supplies in
Blanchard, said he has been without a ready supply of drywall since
November, and must special order it for customers.
</P>
<P>
   He said insulation, lumber and roofing material are also in
short supply. Also, spring is the builders' busiest season, when
most of the new housing construction starts.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that some of the tornado victims will purchase
new homes that were built on speculation in the Oklahoma City area.
But that may require moving to another part of the region, which
some may be unwilling to do.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Farney, a spokeswoman for the Oklahoma City mayor's
office, said there is concern that a shortage of materials and
workers will enable unscrupulous contractors to victimize impatient
homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we are handing out packets to people at our
shelters and command centers,'' Farney said. ``We're telling them
to get three estimates and references, even from builders or
subcontractors from out of town.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that homeowners have to be particularly cautious when
hiring someone to do roofing repairs because Oklahoma doesn't
license roofers.
</P>
<P>
   In Moore, a bedroom community of 50,000 south of Oklahoma City,
many of the survivors of last week's tornadoes are still too busy
salvaging keepsakes and remnants of their belongings to pay
attention to such issues.

MOORE, Okla.: to such issues. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pamela Hester, who is 26 and has three young children, is more
concerned about safety. She told her husband, Shelby, that she will
no longer live in Oklahoma without a storm shelter. All that
remains of their rented home is a 4-by-5-foot closet in the master
bedroom, where the family hid as the tornado roared over them.
</P>
<P>
   It was just last October when a much smaller twister cut a swath
a mile south of last week's trail of destruction. That storm
damaged 150 homes.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Watson, 74, has no intention of leaving. ``I've lived all
my life in Oklahoma, and we learn to get along with this,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   After a 15-year absence, his neighbor Sheila Meadows was
welcomed home to her native Oklahoma by October's tornado. Her
husband is in the Army, stationed in Kansas. She and her three
children survived last week's tornado in their storm shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my three children and my dog,'' she said. ``I'll
rebuild.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the street from where Jody Alexander lived, Shelly Haygood
and her teen-age daughter LaShell were sifting through the ruins of
their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight years ago, I had a house burn to the ground and lost
everything,'' said Haygood, 37 and a single mom. ``I learned that
things can be replaced.''
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't thought about whether she will risk losing a third
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much to do. I've got to hold the mail; I've got to
look to rent something,'' she said. ``But it will be fine. Things
will work out. And I imagine that when all is said and done, I'll
have a good cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools in Moore opened again Monday. Some of the tornado
survivors have already returned to work. But employers are flexible
and giving their workers an opportunity to recover from the trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander has been given a month off with pay by Coca-Cola,
which has also offered free counseling for his family. South Winds,
a nearby apartment complex, has given him an apartment rent-free
for the first three months.
</P>
<P>
   He is married and has three stepchildren. They were looking
forward to the vacation planned for June in Red River, N.M.,
celebrating his first wedding anniversary. He said it would
probably have been the last he and his wife, Donette, could afford
for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Alexander tried to be optimistic. One of his relatives is
a bricklayer who promised to help him rebuild his house if he
decides to stay at 2200 Sunrise Drive. He is counting on assistance
from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   His mom drove 100 miles to bring a new set of dishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``And look at this,'' Alexander said, holding up a small plastic
bag filled with loose change that was buried in the debris. ``I've
got it made.''
</P>
<P>
   At a command center at First Baptist Church in Moore, insurance
companies such as Allstate, Farmers and State Farm had catastrophe
crews on site, parked in huge trailers. They sent claims adjusters
like commando units into the tornado-ravaged neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already writing checks for $5,000 for living expenses,''
said Raleigh Floyd, a spokesperson for Allstate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where we earn our keep,'' said Kitty Miller of
Farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Bulldozers cleared some debris, although the real cleanup will
begin within three weeks under the direction of FEMA.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Moore Police Department said that some of
the debris will be sent to a landfill in Oklahoma City. Some will
have to be burned because there isn't enough room in the Moore
landfill.
</P>
<P>
   As the rebuilding process begins in the weeks ahead, there are
models for these Oklahoma communities to study. This year marked
the 20th anniversary of a tornado that swept through Wichita Falls,
Texas, killing 45 and causing $800 million in damage.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Harper, an architect considered an expert on disaster
recovery, helped formulate the rebuilding plans in Wichita Falls. A
year after ``Terrible Tuesday,'' 85 percent of residential
dwellings in that city had been rebuilt or were in the process of
being rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   Harper also worked hand-in-hand with his alma mater, Texas Tech,
to create in-house storm shelters, steel reinforced rooms or
closets that are likely to become increasingly popular.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Pamela Hester will live in a house with one. Communities
can be rebuilt, but memories of the tornadoes will last a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born here and raised here,'' Hester said, ``but now I'll
be horrified whenever I hear storms come.''

REMEMBERING TRUFFAUT'S TOUCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Francois Truffaut is hot. The Brattle Theatre in Cambridge,
Mass. begins a major retrospective of 10 films and two short
subjects, with all-new 35mm prints, on Thursday. Truffaut's entire
oeuvre is being repackaged and remastered for DVD by Fox Lorber.
Knopf just published a thorough, if somewhat dry, Truffaut
biography by Antoine De Baecque and Serge Toubiana.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because there was no one like Truffaut,'' says Jeanne Moreau,
who starred in several Truffaut films, including ``Jules and Jim''
and ``The Bride Wore Black,'' by telephone from her suite at a New
York hotel. ``When I first thought of watching so many of
Francois's films again, I was sad. When you love a person, and that
person is gone, it is sad. But it is also wonderful that we have so
many of his marvelous films. For those films to all be seen again .
. . we are privileged.''
</P>
<P>
   Francois Truffaut made meaningful films when films had meaning.
He didn't make them for money; he made them for himself and an
audience that believed in film as a redemptive art form. Back when
the success of a film was judged on theme, character, story, and
style and not simply on the weekend box office receipts, Truffaut
flourished. Until he died _ of a brain tumor, at the age of 52, in
1984 _ he gave serious filmgoers funny, complex, entertaining
films.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for Truffaut's success was that he lived a life
outside film. Many directors go directly from film school into the
industry without having tasted life. By the time Truffaut picked up
a camera, he had been disowned by his parents, served a couple of
jail terms, and deserted the French Army. He was broke. During his
incarceration, he had struck up a correspondence and friendship
with novelist Jean Genet and persuaded critic Andre Bazin to be a
character witness during one of Genet's trials. He had lied,
cheated, and stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Francois lived life. He brought his life . . . in some ways a
very difficult life, to his films,'' says Moreau, who was one of
the producers and stars of ``Jules and Jim.''
</P>
<P>
   Life was tough for Truffaut right from the start. Francois
Roland was born out of wedlock to Janine de Monferrand, his Roman
Catholic mother, on Feb. 6, 1932. He was immediately placed with a
nurse and, according to ``Truffaut: A Biography,'' his mother
basically ignored him during his first three years. When his mother
married Roland Truffaut, her new husband gave the little boy his
surname _ but little else. His adoptive father never told him the
truth about their relationship, and his mother treated him as an
afterthought. Francois became a street kid. He acted up in school,
stole items from stores, lied about his attendance, and became a
juvenile delinquent.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The 400 Blows,'' when Truffaut's alter ego Antoine Doinel
(Jean-Pierre Leaud) must come up with an excuse for playing hooky,
he tells his teacher, ``It's my mother, sir . . . she died.''
</P>
<P>
   While only a card-carrying psychobabblist would believe that his
early life was the primary factor leading to Truffaut's lifelong
feelings of alienation, it does present a legitimate starting point
for a brief consideration of his memorable career.
</P>
<P>
   He often sought refuge from both his uncaring parents, truant
officers, and the local police in the cinemas of Paris. There he
found anonymity. Darkness. Escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``These early experiences of watching films on the sly, as a
clandestine activity, became, for Truffaut, a defining condition of
cinema,'' write de Baecque and Toubiana. ``From then on, love of
cinema represented a pocket of resistance in the culture of the
period _ a parallel society, forming a counterculture network,
cultivating a taste for secrecy and contraband, and gradually
taking the shape of an intimate diary, shared with faithful
initiates.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as a kid in his late teens, Francois Truffaut began seeing
things in cinematic terms. Describing his first trip to a film
festival in Biarritz, he wrote ``The beach is straight out of Jean
Vigo, with framings straight out of (Henry) Hathaway, a depth of
field out of (Orson) Welles, and perspectives out of Fritz Lang.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening credit sequence in ``The 400 Blows'' (1958),
Truffaut's first feature, is a series of images of the neighborhood
around the Eiffel Tower shot at a long angle looking upward _
always keeping the Eiffel Tower near the center of the frame. It's
from the child's perspective. And, no matter how Truffaut matured
and how many awards he won or how he was lionized, he never lost
that unique perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Through Doinel, the filmmaker transformed the notion of children
in film from stereotypes to complex little beings. In each of the
Doinel films, beginning with ``The 400 Blows'' and ending with
``Love on the Run,'' Truffaut explored childhood seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``In dealing with life, Antoine Doinel always reacts
emotionally, not intellectually,'' Truffaut said in a 1979
interview to promote the final Doinel film, ``Love on the Run''
(1978). ``We all know well that life doesn't build up to something
glorious or exalted. He's the opposite of an exceptional character,
of a hero, but what distinguishes him from average people is that
he never gets into average situations. He's either profoundly
disappointed and desperate to the point at which we fear the worst,
or he's in a state of total ecstasy and enthusiasm.'' In other
words, still a child.
</P>
<P>
   Even in some of his other films, particularly ``Jules and Jim''
(1961), he uses a childlike perspective. As Truffaut pointed out in
an interview published shortly before his death, ``Jeanne Moreau's
Catherine was the ideal woman seen by a child. A sort of fairy
tale.''
</P>
<P>
   Truffaut always seemed to be searching for two elements that he
believed were missing from his life: a happy childhood and a
permanent love.
</P>
<P>
   As Truffaut got older, his attention turned to passion _
particularly, sexual passion. In ``Two English Girls,'' ``The Story
of Adele H.,'' ``The Green Room,'' and ``The Woman Next Door,'' he
explored the dilemmas and enigmas of romance. Men adoring women,
and women rejecting men, formed the backbone of his career's
mid-life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several of Francois's movies I'm not particularly
fond of,'' says Moreau. ``I never liked `The Man Who Loved Women.'
I thought it was silly. And Francois was not a silly man. He loved
women but in a very deep, rich sense. He also loved paradox. That
is not his best work. And he would not want me to say
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was one particularly revealing remark in ``The Man Who
Loved Women,'' when the title character explains that he likes to
read because it helped him forget a mother who ``could stand me
only if I was silent.''
</P>
<P>
   While many of these Truffaut films have been available only on
VHS during the past 15 years, the current revival and release of
his films on the DVD format allow a new generation to experience
his marvelous artistry. Watching several Truffaut films on DVD, you
can't help thinking of how the filmmaker might have used the
technical capacity of the disc to enrich the experience. What would
it be worth to watch ``Jules and Jim'' while listening to Truffaut
illuminate the film on a separate track? Because of his
encyclopedic knowledge of the cinema and his ability to articulate
his reasons for particular shots or cuts, it would be unrivaled.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Louis Malle, Truffaut's colleague, said, ``Francois
was a very hard worker. He had a desire to work beyond any of us.
And he only liked looking back in his films.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it's our chance to do the same.

DIXIE CHICKS ARE COOKIN' WITH COUNTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dixie Chicks. What could evoke the Deep South more than that
name? Yet, here's the honest truth: Two of the three Dixie Chicks
have Yankee roots and are classically trained, while the other
attended Berklee College of Music. These are no ordinary Chicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents are actually Yankees and I was born in
(Massachusetts),'' says Emily Erwin, 26, whose fellow band members
include older sister Martie Seidel, 29, and lead singer Natalie
Maines, 24, the Berklee connection.
</P>
<P>
   OK, that's where the surprising background ends.
</P>
<P>
   The Dixie Chicks, who are touring with George Strait, Jo Dee
Messina, and other festival acts, grew up mostly in Texas. Erwin
and Seidel lived in Dallas, where they studied the Suzuki method
and classical music in high school, and Maines in Lubbock (home of
Buddy Holly and Waylon Jennings), where her dad was famed pedal
steel guitarist Lloyd Maines.
</P>
<P>
   And here's another truth: No country group has been hotter this
year than the Chicks, whose album ``Wide Open Spaces'' sold 5
million copies and landed on the Top 10 pop charts as well as
country. Last week, the Chicks won in three categories at the
Academy of Country Music Awards in Los Angeles: best group, best
new group, and Album of the Year. That follows the Chicks' Grammy
win for best country album, beating out heavily favored discs by
Shania Twain and Garth Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was truly shocking,'' Erwin says of the Grammy win. ``But
it helped us gain a lot of credibility outside of country music,
too. And that's kind of cool.''
</P>
<P>
   While some of their fashion statements are acutely modern (and
have enabled them to grace many hip magazine covers), their music
is country, with influences dating back to bluegrass and to
storytelling influences from Emmylou Harris and Dolly Parton (both
are idols of Erwin's). Such devotion to tradition no doubt inspired
many Grammy voters to choose the Chicks over the more amorphous,
pop-lusting likes of Twain and Faith Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicks are definitely not trying to follow the Twain and
Hill crossover path. While their album includes songs by Bonnie
Raitt and J. D. Souther, it resonates with timeless country vocal
harmonies and rootsy instrumental breaks on guitar, dobro, banjo
(by Erwin), and fiddle (Seidel).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not consciously trying to go pop,'' says Erwin. ``A
great example is when VH1 called our record label and said they'd
love to run the song `Wide Open Spaces,' but would need to take the
fiddle and pedal steel out. We thought, `Whoa, the fiddle is Martie
and that's taking out one-third of the Dixie Chicks. And the steel
player is Natalie's dad and the steel really makes that song. So,
no, we're not going to change our music to fit your format.' As
much as we'd like to be played on VH1, we're not going to mold
ourselves around that. We know what our strengths are _ and we want
to play country music.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dixie Chicks play it extremely well. On their hit single ``I
Can Love You Better'' (a punchy, cocky tune about making a
boyfriend forget a past love) and on ``There's Your Trouble''
(which won another Grammy for best country vocal performance by a
duo or group), the Chicks exude a contagious energy.
</P>
<P>
   It's also amazing to realize that the album that's caused all
the fuss, ``Wide Open Spaces,'' is really their fourth album.
Before that, the Chicks languished in obscurity _ many people would
be surprised to know, for example, that they've played at Johnny
D's in Somerville four times without much fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   The Nashville-based Chicks started in 1989, when Erwin was only
16. She and her sister had another lead singer at the time and were
obsessed with frilly gingham dresses on stage and a more
bluegrass-based sound that sailed past the ears of most Nashville
executives.
</P>
<P>
   But when Maines signed up a few years ago, the fashion statement
changed and the music toughened into bolder country-rock. ``When
Natalie joined, she said, `I dig your music, but I'm not wearing
stupid clothes.' I totally understood,'' says Erwin. ``At the time,
the cowgirl thing was really a gimmick. I mean, as far as being who
you are, I'm not a cowgirl. . . . So we kind of re-created
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chicks now favor more sexy, modern outfits, though short of
the risque level of Shania Twain. ``We don't play the sexy card
that Shania does, but we do enjoy glamor,'' says Erwin. ``I mean,
be serious about your music and know what you want to do but have
fun with it, too. It is not worth doing if you take yourself too
seriously. And part of it is that we're just girly girls who love
putting on makeup and getting pretty clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   New singer Maines also steered the group toward a more
contemporary musical direction. She suggested recording Bonnie
Raitt's ``Give It Up or Let Me Go'' on the latest album. And the
group also added more guitar, which pleased radio programmers who
crave snappy guitar hooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned guitar out of necessity because banjo wasn't going
on some of the country stuff that we wanted to approach,'' says
Erwin, whose specialty had been the five-string. ``So I wanted to
learn the guitar, and the dobro went along with that. It's all a
matter of expanding and experimenting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where Martie and I came from bluegrass, Natalie came from more
Texas country and blues,'' adds Erwin. ``And it was really a group
effort in choosing the songs. Natalie is the huge Bonnie Raitt fan,
and she also brought in the Dobie Gray hit, `Loving Arms.' And
Martie and I wrote one based on our parents' divorce, the `You Were
Mine' song. And the other ones we just picked up from other
songwriters. We loved Radney Foster's `Riding,' so we pursued him
to give us some songs and luckly found one that we really liked. I
think we looked under stones that other country artists don't look
under. They look for maybe what is a country song, as opposed to
what is a great song that you can turn into a country song.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, the Dixie Chicks will play some Lilith Fair dates
this summer (``We want to bring country to that audience''), as
well as more shows as part of George Strait's stadium tour. At this
point, the Chicks are big enough to headline on their own, but
they're choosing to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to go out and headline with just one album of
material with this lineup,'' Erwin says. ``People who are
headlining have hours of hits. And though we've been lucky with how
many Top Five singles we've had off this album, it doesn't make for
a two-hour show. But the George Strait tour is a perfect
opportunity to get in front of an average of 50,000 people a night
and turn them on to our music, so next year we can hopefully get
those same people back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's great to just play one hour a night and go
knock 'em dead and then hang out with all the other artists the
rest of the day. You're not having to worry about the catering, the
promotion, and everything else. It's somebody else's problem and
somebody else's headache. I love it.''

LIFE ON THE LINE 
One Woman's Tale of Work, Sweat, and Survival 
By Solange De Santis 
Doubleday, 272 pp., $24.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Near the end of another long night, the close of another long
week on the assembly line, a group of auto-plant workers
interrupted their grueling 5 p.m. to 1 a.m. shift with an impromptu
water-balloon fight. After monotonous hours of installing van
windows, the laughter and watery explosions were a welcome respite.
</P>
<P>
   Among the workers was Solange De Santis, Sally to her fellow
shoprats. She participated in the game, but also viewed it all
``from a vantage point far away, an out-of-coveralls experience.
The worker jams in another window, fits another liner to the frame.
The reporter, a visitor on this blue-collar planet thinks, Yes,
this is perfect. This is why I am here. This will make a terrific
story.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``terrific story'' to which De Santis refers is her own, and
that's the nagging problem with her book, ``Life on the Line.'' In
1991, De Santis, then a reporter at the Toronto Globe &AMP; Mail, took
a leave from journalism for a job at General Motors' Scarborough
Van Plant in Ontario. The plant was slated to close in 18 months,
and while that would seem the most compelling story _ a close-up
look at the 2,700 workers erased by corporate downsizing _ it
wasn't the one that really interested De Santis.
</P>
<P>
   The book's subtitle says it all: ``One Woman's Tale of Work,
Sweat, and Survival.'' This is De Santis's story of how a woman
ensconced in the white-collar world decided to play ``Norma Rae''
for a while. She would enter the auto plant not as a seasoned, Ivy
League-educated journalist, but as ``Sal,'' a woman with a sketchy
work history eager to earn a steady wage. It's all very
well-intentioned, but the book fails to rise much above a vanity
project.
</P>
<P>
   For De Santis, working in the plant was a walk on the wild side.
Always, she had known a life of comfort: raised in New York,
daughter of a trade-organization executive and a fashion writer.
Even before she graduated from Columbia University, she had her
first journalism job at NBC Radio. Jobs at Reuters, the Associated
Press, and the Palm Beach Post would follow until, nearing 40, De
Santis began to have her doubts about strolling ``the plush carpet
life had woven for me without stepping off and walking barefoot on
the gravel.''
</P>
<P>
   So when she hears of the imminent closing of a GM plant in
suburban Toronto, De Santis moved to swap ``the genteel world of
desks, air-conditioning, computers, telephones, and Post-it notes''
for the mind- and muscle-numbing grind of the assembly line.
``Working at the van plant would be a character test: my Everest,
my Zen monastery,'' she writes, admitting ``My interest wasn't
political in nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Slipping into her $16-an-hour job in fiberglass insulation, De
Santis finds the work tough and tedious. The insulation is hard to
handle; the fibers sting her hands and are easily inhaled. Still,
she enjoys her new identity as Sally because ``it sounded jaunty.
Rosie the Riveter, meet Sally the Autoworker.''
</P>
<P>
   But everything at the plant isn't as free and easy, and De
Santis's recollections of her co-workers' off-the-line hardships
are the book's highlight. Men and women would anesthesize
themselves nightly with drugs or with beers at Gene's, a favorite
watering hole. On any given night, half its customers were wearing
GM overalls, and, to De Santis, the place seemed like ``the
cafeteria with a liquor license and slightly better food.''
</P>
<P>
   She finds workers with dreams beyond the factory walls,
including her supervisor Lance, a high-school graduate who aspires
to attend an Ivy League school and move up the GM management
ladder. De Santis already has that degree, which she comes to
appreciate as she realizes it's something most of her co-workers
will never achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the time, ``Life on the Line'' plays like a hardscrabble
version of ``The Wizard of Oz,'' with De Santis as Dorothy,
recognizing again and again that there's no place like home. At
least, that's the prevalent feeling when she isn't making the
assembly line sound like one of those roughing-it-for-a-week
Outward Bound courses.
</P>
<P>
   This subject was better covered in Ben Hamper's ``Rivethead:
Tales from the Assembly Line,'' a humorous, heartbreaking memoir of
his years as a worker at GM's ill-fated Flint, Mich., factory. De
Santis, who's now a Wall Street Journal reporter, means well _ but
she's never more than a stranger in a strange land. Swayed by her
own gee-whiz bravado, she misses the heart of those who truly live
their lives on the line, if only because she could always walk away
_ and, unlike most of her co-workers, walk away to something far
better.

MEN TIRED OF LOOKING OLD TURN TO COSMETIC SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PHIL DAVIS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Comedian John Byner was tired of the grumpy face
that greeted him in the mirror each morning. The downturned corners
of his mouth, puffy eyes and creases on his face prompted one fan
to remark: ``I can't believe all that humor comes from such a
sad-looking man.''
</P>
<P>
   His grim visage wasn't keeping him from landing roles on sitcoms
like ``Dharma &AMP; Greg'' and ``Caroline in the City,'' but the
61-year-old veteran television and movie actor didn't feel the way
his face looked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good inside, and I'd go by a mirror or a window and I'd
see this grumpy-looking guy,'' Byner said. ``I thought I looked
tired.''
</P>
<P>
   So Byner joined the growing ranks of men who are shaving off
years of worry and wrinkles with cosmetic surgery. On March 8,
Beverly Hills plastic surgeon Richard Ellenbogen gave Byner a full
face lift, sucked the fat deposits from under his eyes, lifted the
corners of his mouth and raised his forehead. The surgery was
broadcast live on the Internet as a publicity stunt.
</P>
<P>
   Byner got the surgery for free _ one reason he's talking about
it while most men keep their cosmetic nips and tucks a secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good,'' Byner said last week. ``I don't even think
about it anymore. I don't like to think about it in terms of how
many years the surgery took off. I look at it in terms of looking
the way I feel _ and that is a lot less grumpy.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons, more than 99,000 men underwent cosmetic surgical
procedures in 1998. That accounts for about 10 percent of all
procedures performed last year.
</P>
<P>
   Statistically, the percentage of men seeking cosmetic surgery
has increased only slightly since experts starting tallying numbers
in 1992. But overall, both men and women are seeking out plastic
surgeons in record numbers _ up 153 percent from 413,000 patients
in 1992 to more than 1 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Liposuction _ sucking away love handles and other fatty deposits
_ leads the way for both men and women. But men also are signing up
in record numbers for blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery), followed by
face lifts, rhinoplasty (nose jobs) and male breast-reduction
surgery to correct the condition known as gynecomastia. The
popularity of short hairstyles also has men seeking oloplasty,
surgery that aligns the ears closer to the head, in numbers nearly
equal to women.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Gross, an assistant professor of plastic surgery at the
University of Southern California, said now that men are living
longer and healthier lives, it's natural they also want to look
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the stigma that used to go along with plastic surgery
_ that it is only a female thing _ has passed,'' he said. ``As the
comfort level increases, it will be talked about more and
eventually will become the norm.''
</P>
<P>
   But, for now at least, there are centuries of machismo to
overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still not the macho thing,'' Gross admitted. ``I just saw
a husband and wife in their 60s. I'd already done their daughter's
face lift, and the mother is coming in to have her face lift. The
husband really wants his neck done, but I can tell he's too macho
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't stop men entirely. It just makes them more stealthy
than women.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a woman has breast enlargement surgery, she shows
everyone,'' Ellenbogen said. ``Men are a little less showy. They'll
talk about it, but they just don't volunteer much. That's the crux
of the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Surgeons also say they're seeing more than just actors and
executives on their operating tables. Notice the UPS delivery man
looking a tad younger?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all of the above,'' said Dr. Michael Rabkin, an expert in
using lasers to zap fat from eyelids. ``I've done professional
wrestlers, guys who work for the phone company, even a UPS
driver.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It amazes me who does this stuff,'' echoed Ellenbogen. ``I
have a patient who is a Harley-Davidson biker who came in for
liposuction. He's the last guy in the world you'd think would be
unhappy with his beer belly. But he had his girlfriend's breasts
done a few months ago, and while we were in the office he lifted
his shirt and asked, `Can you do anything about that?'''
</P>
<P>
   High costs still make cosmetic surgery a luxury. A face lift
costs more than $4,500. And upper and lower eyelid surgery will set
you back nearly $3,000, according to the ASPRS.
</P>
<P>
   Until the last decade, cosmetic surgery techniques favored women
over men. Men's skin is looser than women's, and if it's just
pulled back it can leave a feminine look. Then there's the beard;
surgeons have to be mindful not to change the locations of the
beard or sideburns when moving skin.
</P>
<P>
   Male fat also tends to be more fibrous. But new ultrasonic
liposuction techniques liquefy fat and make it easier to suck out.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, new techniques using lasers and laparoscopy
(performing surgery via cameras inserted through small incisions)
mean the recuperation time that used to be associated with plastic
surgery is minimal. Now a man can slip away from the office on
Friday to get his eyelids done and return to work on Monday looking
well-rested.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've actually brought plastic surgery to the masses by
bringing it to outpatient centers instead of the hospital,''
Ellenbogen said.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic surgery isn't for everyone. Surgeons love the boom but
warn image-conscious consumers to shop around and make sure they
have an understanding and rapport with their doctor before surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to have realistic expectations about how they are
going to look,'' Gross said. ``Don't expect more than can
surgically be delivered. You can't take a 300-pound, markedly
overweight man and make him look like an athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   The ideal candidate for cosmetic surgery is already in fairly
good shape and just wants some minor improvements to look younger.
</P>
<P>
   Byner is happy with his results, and he's not sorry he went
public, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people will look into my face like they're looking
into a crystal ball, trying to see what I had done,'' Byner said.
``But most people are hip to it, as they say in the music world.
They say, `Hey, you look great. You still look like John Byner, and
you look younger, too.' &UR;  &LR; ''

 TAKE-BOS  
 BOSTON: ... into her life.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I first heard Jo in this family-style dinner club an hour and
a half outside of Nashville,'' recalls Gallimore, whose roster of
heavyweight artists includes Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, Brooks and
Dunn, and Randy Travis. ``I guess it was around 1991. I'm telling
you, she was as good that night as she is today. She stole those
people's hearts. I called her two days later and asked her to come
in for a meeting. The first thing she said was `I don't have any
money.' And I said, `I don't want any money. I just want to work
with you.' I guess she'd heard so many tales about being taken
advantage of in Nashville that it took her a while to trust me. So
we cut some sides, and Tim pretty well flipped over her. When she
signed to Curb, he wanted to help out.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallimore and McGraw co-produced both of Messina's albums, which
Gallimore accurately describes as unique. ``She has a fire in her
voice that transmits on tape,'' he says. ``Her energy level is off
the map. It's just the way she is. She's a survivor, and she's done
it with raw talent.''
</P>
<P>
   A &AMP; R executive Phil Gernhard, who signed Jo Dee to Curb in 1995
before taking a year off, is more circumspect about her troubled
start. ``I never would have put that record out,'' Gernhard says.
``She didn't know who she was yet as a recording artist. A lot of
those tracks were experiments. But Tim was involved, and he's an
impetuous boy.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Messina had begun work on ``I'm Alright,'' she'd had
more touring and recording experience, and Gernhard was back at
Curb. ``As soon as we started, it was like `Wow, she's found
herself.' She had matured, she had a firm grasp on her music.'' In
his estimation, Messina's next album _ though technically her third
_ will function as the crucial sophomore effort, because it will be
the one to follow her breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The easy part is over,'' he says. ``The struggling isn't the
hard part, even though you were starving. The hard part is now,
when it gets serious. It's a business with responsibilities. It's a
pressure cooker, and this is when a lot of people get thrown.
That's why you see artists, talented artists, come and go. But Jo
Dee could run for president and win if she wanted to. She's got the
drive and determination. Jo Dee's future is up to Jo Dee.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Surviving has become second nature to Messina, but not
necessarily in the way one would imagine. During the limo ride from
WKLB to the Orpheum for sound check, Messina is glued to her cell
phone. The vivacious showperson who wowed fans in radioland is once
again quiet, curled in the corner of the car, deep in discussion
with a business associate about the merits of a concert offer. The
pay is good, but evidently the venue is questionable. ``Think
career, not money,'' Messina instructs at the end of the call,
despite the fact that she's not yet out of the red.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lessons she learned from the tumult of achieving sudden
success, then losing it all, and now rebuilding her life and career
have underlined Messina's abiding faith _ in both her spiritual and
professional path. ``When I was away from radio for a year or so, I
really relied on God, on him delivering my true friends, and
delivering a smile on days when I couldn't make myself smile,'' she
says, her gaze as steadfast as her belief. ``I've learned how rare
it is to have a career in this business. I've learned about the
folks who have tried and tried and still can't get it done and
there is no obvious reason. So you don't compromise, even if it
kills you. And it has killed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bigger than the blow to her pocketbook was the blow to her sense
of humanity _ naive though it may have been. Her memories of
growing up in Holliston are idyllic. ``We had mom-and-pop pizza
places. We had Fiske's, which is like a general store,'' she
recalls, her eyes glowing. ``It had rows and rows of candy in the
buckets, you know, and you'd go in and get a lollipop, or a piece
of gum, or licorice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up next to the Aldermans my whole life. They were the
greatest people on the face of this earth. And I thought everyone
in the world was like the Aldermans. I thought everyone was that
honest, that trustworthy, that considerate, that kind, that loyal,
that caring, that real. In Nashville, I realized that everyone is
not like the Aldermans. When I stopped getting airplay on the
radio, my phone stopped ringing. No one would return my calls.
People I thought were my friends. And I was devastated.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a silver lining to her travails, it's a pointed, and
poignant, appreciation for what she has. The deed to a modest
three-bedroom house 20 miles east of Nashville. The means to buy a
station wagon for her mother, who now lives near Messina in
Tennessee. (So, by the way, does Sean Alderman, her former
neighbor, whom she hired to work for her.) A joy in singing that's
so great she can't find the words to describe it. The knowledge
that ``all these things that I have in my life, all the success, is
blessing,'' Messina says, clear-eyed and quiet, and you know she
means it. ``It's like the song, `I'm Alright.' I'm here, I'm living
life. I'm not rich. I'm not poor. I've got my health. I'm in the
game. I guess I'm doing OK.''

`AFFORDABLE HOUSING' CREATES STIR IN EXCLUSIVE TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   POINT REYES STATION, Calif. _ The working-class families,
ranchers and wealthy professionals who live among the coastal
hamlets of western Marin County differ in many ways, but they share
an attitude: They don't like outsiders telling them what to do.
</P>
<P>
   So Tuesday night they will crowd into the biggest building in
the area, the Red Barn, to settle by secret ballot one of the most
divisive issues that has engaged the community in recent years:
Should affordable housing be built in Point Reyes Station for the
people who work in this hub of western Marin County but cannot
afford to live here?
</P>
<P>
   For renter Oscar Gamez, assistant manager at Toby's Feed Barn,
the answer is clear. ``We need it,'' he said. ``I'm the only one
working at Toby's who lives here. I'd like to stay here if I can.
This is our one chance to own a house.''
</P>
<P>
   For Jeanette Pontacq, an organic flower grower and retired chief
executive of a large San Francisco travel agency, the correct
decision is equally clear: thumbs down. ``It's like a Trojan horse
has come into West Marin,'' she said. ``This is basically an urban
solution to a rural problem.''
</P>
<P>
   There are only 362 residences in picturesque Point Reyes
Station, population 900. It's a small town and proud of it. An
electric cow moo can be heard daily all over town at noon and 6
o'clock, giving folks the time. The local weekly newspaper, the
Point Reyes Light, has won a Pulitzer Prize. And its main street is
home to some of the best bars (The Western) and restaurants
(Tomales Bay Foods, Station House) in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Rentals here are hard to find, and home prices range from
$270,000 to $900,000 and up.
</P>
<P>
   Now, EAH of San Rafael, the second largest nonprofit housing
developer in the San Francisco Bay area, wants to build 49 units _
all but five to be sold at below-market rates _ on a 19-acre horse
pasture in the northeast corner of Point Reyes Station. Combined
with a senior housing complex already approved, the projects would
expand the local housing stock by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This area, just north of San Francisco, has never faced such
rapid growth before, but residents are tackling the issue in their
time-tested, albeit idiosyncratic way _ they're talking it out,
trying to reach community consensus.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a community decision,'' said Lamar Turner,
the project manager for EAH. ``We've never done anything like this
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Literally.
</P>
<P>
   If the town hall voters don't support the project, EAH will walk
away. If they do, the company will proceed.
</P>
<P>
   The project abuts West Marin School and is contiguous to the
town itself. As planned, the development would include 26 rental
units, 10 cottages, eight live-work units and five lots to be sold
at market rate. EAH would use the federal low-income housing tax
credit to subsidize the rental units. As for the rest, ``We will
make them as affordable as we can,'' Turner said. ``We will
certainly ask for and pursue subsidies.''
</P>
<P>
   After 10 months of planning, EAH has yet to apply to the Marin
County Planning Commission, the Coastal Commission and other
agencies for zoning changes and other permits necessary for the
project. Instead, working with a 13-member steering committee
selected by local organizations, it has tried to incorporate
community concerns raised at a dozen forums. If Tuesday night's
vote falls below 60 percent approval, EAH's board of directors is
expected to drop the project.
</P>
<P>
   Few here debate the need for more affordable housing, but
opponents such as Pontacq do debate whether this rural community
should encourage a development of this size.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to set a huge precedent for more development, and
people are going to be sorry later,'' Pontacq said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   George Stamoulis, a Point Reyes Station resident who works in
San Francisco, agreed: ``It's a gigantic, quantum leap. It's like
dumping 30,000 houses in San Francisco overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet others say the housing shortage has grown so severe it's
altering the very nature of the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our workers go through the torments of the damned to get
housing out here,'' said Dave Mitchell, editor and publisher of the
Point Reyes Light. ``We have dishwashers out here who have to
commute almost an hour from Petaluma. ... We recently went to hire
a reporter and got about 50 letters of application, including two
or three top-notch people. When they found out the housing
situation here, they all backed out.''
</P>
<P>
   Existing zoning would allow up to 30 homes on the site, 19 fewer
than EAH proposes. Elizabeth Ptak, executive director of the Marin
Agricultural Land Trust, said she believed the project was in-fill,
not sprawl, and would fit nicely into the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``This process is quite unique _ a real attempt to deal with two
imperatives, a growing population and the impact on the beauty. ...
It's balancing the aesthetics of a small-town atmosphere against
the social need,'' Ptak said. The 19-acre horse pasture, which is
zoned residential, ``is destined to be developed, and if it's not
used for this purpose, it will very likely be developed with very
expensive homes.''

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science

</P>

   SCI-DRUG-REVIEW (Washington) _ Criticized for having to pull
back medication it had allowed on the market, the Food and Drug
Administration issues a review of its drug-approval process and
finds it adequate. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg. (800 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-TORNADOES (Undated) _ Most of the process leading up to the
critical moment of tornado genesis is well understood. But unless
and until research meteorologists can solve the puzzle of the last
crucial step, they will be at a loss to predict whether a garden
variety tornado is on the way, or one so puny it will fall apart at
the first obstacle it hits _ or a monster like one that struck the
outskirts of Oklahoma city on May 3, demolishing entire
neighborhoods and killing dozens of people. That tornado now
appears to have been one of the most powerful ever observed.
Scientists hope data they gathered that day will help solve the
mystery. By William K. Stevens. (1950 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SPY-SAFEHOUSE (Undated) _ New research suggests that among
the adobe walls and Indian curios of the Santa Fe plaza was a drug
store whose spare rooms served as a safe house some 50 years ago
when thousands of scientists were working on the bomb nearby. In
this refuge, Los Alamos experts are said to have given Moscow the
intellectual heart of the bomb. By William J. Broad. (1250 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-LIE-DETECTION (Undated) _ Researchers have demonstrated that
most people perform miserably on a test to determine who on a
videotape is lying and who is telling the truth, scoring at chance
levels or only slightly higher, although for each liar on the tape
a variety of clues were present that might have revealed the lies.
By Erica Goode. (1850 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MATH-BRAIN (Undated) _ The ability to do mathematics _
everything from simple arithmetic to thinking up equations that
explain an expanding universe _ may stem from the interaction of
two brain circuits that handle numbers differently, two scientists
have found. During human evolution, the researchers suggest, these
two brain areas combined forces and gave rise to the remarkable
human capacity for manipulating numbers arithmetically. Their
interaction may also underlie many kinds of advanced mathematics.
By Sandra Blakeslee. (1200 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BEETLES-FIRE (Undated) _ Researchers are studying the
biology of the beetles that flock to smoke and fire and promptly

display what biologists call adaptive radiation, the evolution of a
founding population into an array of different species, each
adapted to its own ecological niche. By Nicholas Wade. (525 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MUSIC-SCIENCE (Undated) _ The connections between music and
science are subtle and uncertain, and all too often we are asked to
accept on faith the supposed links between the concert hall and the
laboratory. A seemingly endless debate persists between those who
regard music as a branch of physics and those who see it as the
artistic product of inspired but inexplicable minds. The latest
attempt to bridge the chasm was offered last week at the Guggenheim
by the Emerson String Quartet and a Columbia University physics
professor, whose words-and-music performance was not exactly a
recital and not exactly a lecture; it was something like what
people in the 1960s called a ``happening.'' By Malcolm W. Browne.

for illnesses like flu or chickenpox. But since that discovery, the
syndrome has been virtually eliminated in the United States. By
Lawrence K. Altman. (1750 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-INTERNET-MEDICINE (Undated) _ More and more hospitals and
medical establishments are making vast troves of medical
information available on the Internet, and some are even
maintaining large staffs to do it. By Lisa Napoli. (620 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ Shorts on health and fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ Doctors in training communicated by E-mail with students in
kindergarten through 12th grade in rural Vermont as part of a study
that showed children had many medical questions that weren't
getting addressed when they visited the doctor with their parents.

   KOSOVO-NATO (Washington) _ NATO and U.S. officials stick to
their guns, promising to continue air strikes against Yugoslavia
despite Serbian troop reductions in Kosovo and China's anger over

same-sex marriages; requiring parental consent for abortions;
authorizing state-operated casinos; and taking the historic Alamo

job any longer. His obstruction of justice suit against Julie Hiatt
Steele should never have been brought in the first place, and the
mistrial proves the hung jury had more sense than he does. By
MARIANNE MEANS.

   ROBISON-COLUMN (Austin, Texas) _ One of the Texas governor's
strongest weapons in a relatively weak arsenal is the power to call
special sessions of the Legislature and set the agenda. But Gov.
George W. Bush, who has never called a special session, surely is
aware that this same weapon, if not handled with great care, may
end up shooting him in the foot _ or worse. By CLAY ROBISON.

   BKN-ROCKETS (Los Angeles) _ The Houston Rockets did many things
right in their playoff opener against the Lakers, but they undid it

finger-pointing in the locker room after the game. Can they regroup
_ on and off the court _ before Game 2 Tuesday night? By JONATHAN

   BKN-PIPPEN (Los Angeles) _ Scottie Pippen was brought in by the

shows the trade may yet work out well for the Lakers. By JEROME

THIS CULTURE DOES NOT HAVE AN `OFF' SWITCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH LAFAVE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - (begin ital) ``If you don't like what you see on
television, you can turn it off.'' (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   We've all heard this in one form or another. ``If you don't like
(insert anything), you can turn it off.'' If you don't like certain
language, or violence, or innuendo, you don't have to view it.
</P>
<P>
   What's true for the rectangular luminescences in our living
rooms is a microcosm of the bigger scene. If you dislike certain
trends in music or movies or lifestyle or belief patterns, you
don't have to engage them. You have a free choice to accept
anything, or reject anything. Such is the blessing of a free
society.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of things, this is obviously true. Yes, I can turn
off a television. I can even throw one out. I can also live as I
wish (more or less), practice my beliefs as I desire (within
limits) and accept or reject any ideas, trends, entertainments or
artistic endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   But _ and this is the thing usually forgotten _ (begin ital) I
cannot choose to live in a culture that is free of the elements I
reject. (end ital) I cannot choose the field of choices from which
I select what I deem right, beautiful, appropriate. And it is
precisely this field of choices that sets the context for my
personal decisions. Inevitably it limits them. Unless I live as a
hermit, I must deal with elements I might prefer to reject
outright. I have no choice. Neither do you.
</P>
<P>
   You can't turn off the Big TV _ the culture at large, with its
specific do's and don'ts. A culture is no more than this: a field
of choices, of lifestyle choices, belief choices, arts and
entertainment choices. These choices can be narrow, they can be
wide. But they are never unlimited. They cannot be. Choice is
always contextual, always somehow limited.
</P>
<P>
   A pizza delivery man once roared up to my house with rap music
going full-blast that including the f-word. I could not choose to
have him not blare it. I might ask him to turn it off or even
complain to the store owner, but I was powerless to control the
exposure at that moment.
</P>
<P>
   I would prefer to live in a culture free of that sort of easy
pseudo-sophistication, that smug atmosphere in which the mere
employment of a simple curse word is taken as a symbol of freedom
and hipness. However, short of moving to a remote place in, say,
Alaska, I cannot make that choice, anymore than someone living in
the 1950s could have chosen to live in a culture that encouraged
the license to which I object. Everybody is stuck with the culture
at hand, and with the field of choices it offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turn off the television'' is particularly insulting when
applied to parents, as it often is, usually by non-parents. In our
house, the grown-ups battled for a long time to keep the young ones
from saying ``butt.'' That wasn't a word we found appropriate;
``behind'' was encouraged in its place. You can disagree with the
choice, but it was our choice, and that is the point: our choice
didn't matter. ``Butt'' is in all the television shows and movies,
and even if our kids didn't see those shows and movies, they have
dozens of friends at two schools, and ``butt'' _ whether we like it
or not _ is generally acceptable among them. It sneaked in through
peer groups, along with a couple other choice words that were never
heard in our house, either on TV or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Even flipping the channels is a dangerous business. Unless it is
done swiftly, and preferably with the mute button on, a parent can
easily find himself having to explain oral sex, adultery, abortion
and child molestation _ and that's just from a chance encounter
with the nightly news. &QL; 
SOLUTIONS TO TV
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps eliminating television entirely is an option, although
it would take enormous effort, energy and ingenuity to come up with
ample replacements in society as now constructed. It would also be
necessary to turn off a few kids at school whose parents don't turn
off the TV. Showing only select videotapes is a possibility,
although it would mean staying up at night pre-screening everything
for content. (As guides, ratings are a big joke.)
</P>
<P>
   For a while, the most horrific elements can be kept at bay. The
kids don't have to see Jerry Springer. But even that will
eventually become a losing battle. As children grow into teens,
some among their peers will happen to see Springer and his ilk _ no
parent can monitor a teenager 24 hours a day _ and these few will
report to the others about the woman who took 300 lovers in 24
hours or the man who slept with his wife's entire family. The
culture cannot be turned off.
</P>
<P>
   But it can be changed. Cultures are always changing, in little
ways and big. People have their effect on the big picture. Voices
can be raised in objection to explicitly sexual television content.
Protests can be lodged against violence-laden song lyrics. Critical
eyes and ears can be turned to dislodging bad art posing as free
expression.
</P>
<P>
   It becomes necessary to add a disclaimer: I am not advocating
government censorship. We have become accustomed to thinking that,
because a person dislikes X, he then thinks it should be against
the law. There are plenty of legal things I dislike, but I do not
wish them legislated against. There are also many illegal things I
dislike that I would like to see legalized. It is the role of
culture, not government, to determine the choices we have. It is
culture that must be influenced. &QL; 
 &QL; 
POLITICS OF HYPOCRISY
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I can already hear somebody mumbling about ``cultural
censorship.'' To protest any expression of any kind is to engage in
de facto censorship, some people say.
</P>
<P>
   This is hypocrisy in full swing, for there is always cultural
censorship. Always. Any culture allows some forms of expression and
restricts and punishes others. Try, for example, to tell certain
jokes. Tell a joke offensive to anyone but rednecks and
Republicans, and you could be out of a job. Write a script that
glorifies smoking or presents politically incorrect content and it
won't get produced. There is acceptable expression and unacceptable
expression in baby boomer America just as there is acceptable and
unacceptable expression in every conceivable society. That's
cultural censorship. Wherever there are people, it will exist. The
only thing that changes is what is acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't like what's currently acceptable, if you object to
the cultural context you're stuck with, you have the right to
attempt to change it through art, through protest, through
educational reform. ``Turning off the television'' is not only not
enough, it simply isn't possible. &QL;

 &HT;    'FREIERS' ARE SUCKERS, LOATHED IN ISRAELI POLITICS
 &HT;    425&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ To many Israelis, Prime Minister Benjamin ``Bibi''
Netanyahu is stubborn, brazen, and maybe a little loose with the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   That's why they like him.
</P>
<P>
   After all, you can call the controversial leader a lot of names,
but he's no ``freier.''
</P>
<P>
   Pronounced ``frier,'' it means ``sucker'' or ``pushover'' and
the word has become a hot button in the approach to Monday's
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Just as no American candidate wants to be seen as a liar, no
Israeli pol can afford to be taken for a ``freier'' -- not in the
tough neighborhood of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bibi is never going to be a freier in anything,'' says
28-year-old Kobi Agami, a Netanyahu supporter who sells pastries in
the Mehaneh Yehuda produce and meat market. ``Especially not with
the Arabs. He's not going to give and give.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, when it comes to politics, Agami adds, ``You can't
trust anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is popular in the crowded stalls of the market, where
the noisy haggling is nearly an art-form and ``freiers'' get swept
aside like yesterday's corn husks.
</P>
<P>
   In everyday Israel, you're a ``freier'' if you wait in line
instead of cutting in, if you actually stop smoking in a no-smoking
area, or if you compromise easily on anything from a parking space
to politics. While Americans might consider it a virtue to be
laid-back, in Israel that's considered foolish complacency.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly derived from Yiddish, antipathy to the ``freier'' may
have started as the tiny country won its toe-hold along the
Mediterranean, battling great odds and in defiance of its Arab
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a deep cultural phenomenon in Israel,'' says Israeli
sociologist Hanna Herzog at Tel Aviv University.
</P>
<P>
   Its daily manifestations can enrage foreigners -- naive
Americans are seen as mega-freiers. But, Herzog said, the concept
helped Israelis shed the stereotype of dependence and weakness that
stigmatized Jews in European ghettos.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, parliamentary candidate Tommy Lapid, an overbearing
talk show personality, has built a political movement by playing
the ``freier'' card.
</P>
<P>
   Lapid's Change Party is running a rant against ultra-Orthodox
Jews, who he makes out to be freeloaders Israel can't afford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello to you, Freier,'' begins a Change Party pamphlet.
</P>
<P>
   The flier asks non-religious Israelis why they serve in the army
while ultra-Orthodox Jews get military exemptions and why they pay
taxes that support religious people who don't work. ``Why?'' the
pamphlet asks, ``Because you're a freier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It works,'' Lapid says. ``There is nothing that people in
Israel hate more than being taken as a sucker.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add begins.)
</P>
<P>
   Once a political oddity, polls now show Lapid's campaign may win
six seats in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, fighting for second term, frequently taps into
Israel's fear of ``freiers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not freiers,'' Netanyahu told high-schoolers in April,
explaining his reluctance to give the Palestinians land under the
Oslo peace process.
</P>
<P>
   While Netanyahu's opponents accuse him of being sneaky, some
consider that a quality in facing Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
who Israelis see as an untrustworthy terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Netanyahu) may not be the guy you would buy a used car from,
but the perception is that he will use these shrewd skills in the
(peace) negotiations,'' said Ephraim Yuchtman Ya'ar, an Israeli
sociologist.
</P>
<P>
   But, Netanyahu may find he can only go so far with an image as a
master manipulator.
</P>
<P>
   Some new anti-Netanyahu banners are cropping up around the
capital: ``Only a freier would vote for Netanyahu twice.''

   It's useless to compare him with anyone else. He's different. He
follows his own drummer and has abounding self-confidence and a
clear concept of mission. Jackson is an intuitive advocate,
champion of the underdog, promoter of equality, defender of
justice. When he perceives a wrong, he wants to right it. He makes
waves, and they splash on people.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse thinks he can talk, or shame, the meanest men on earth
into doing something decent. Surprisingly often, he can. Sometimes
a hard-bitten foreign dictator or profit-driven corporate head is
persuaded by Jackson to perform a simple humanitarian act for a
reason that others may suspect as self-serving. But it's hard to
quarrel with the obvious, simple results of the good deed.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Jackson and a broad-based committee of American
clergy prevailed upon Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
release the three U.S. servicemen he'd been holding as prisoners of
war. Some people bridled at Jackson's brand of personal diplomacy.
Some accused him of interfering with President Clinton's conduct of
foreign policy. Maybe he was, although it's hard to see how.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has suggested that America would be better off with Steve
Gonzales, Chris Stone and Andy Ramirez still in that Serbian
prison.
</P>
<P>
   No president likes to be upstaged, particularly in foreign
affairs. Not even by a friend. Some claiming to know Clinton's mind
say he was ticked off when former President Jimmy Carter, in a
similar mission of personal diplomacy, opened up a dialogue with
North Korean leaders after four decades of bristling armaments and
military threats.
</P>
<P>
   All I know of that episode is that Carter had kept Clinton
informed of his effort and thought he had a clear understanding of
the president's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   There was an obvious misunderstanding, however, in Carter's
journey to Haiti later that year where he and Gen. Colin Powell
persuaded the reigning military junta to stand aside and let the
elected president resume office. A disagreement on how to handle
the negotiations, after they were well under way, almost resulted
in a major international embarrassment. While Carter appealed to
reason, Clinton threatened force.
</P>
<P>
   Save for a successful last-ditch plea by Carter, a
presidentially ordered bombing raid would have rained terror down
on the pitifully poor Caribbean capital just at the moment that the
armed usurpers were agreeing to relinquish power. That
miscalculation could have been a tragedy of monstrous proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Any president needs support and cooperation from the nation if
he is to conduct foreign policy successfully. No American should
set out to embarrass or undermine him. Even so, there are times
when private, unofficial, ``back-channel'' diplomatic probes are
not only useful but necessary. When bilateral
government-to-government communications formally break down,
presidents must rely on informal emissaries as long as there is any
hope for a peaceful settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon both employed a variety of
go-betweens in a vain effort to communicate with Ho Chi Minh and
his successors in Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   Two American businessmen doing business in the Soviet Union _
Armand Hammer and Dwayne Andreas _ reported regularly to Ronald
Reagan after talks with top Soviet officialdom through the 1980s.
Several times I filled a similar role in Latin America for
President Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's initiatives are different from these in that he is
pursuing an agenda of his own making, not necessarily the
president's. Not that the chief executive could disapprove of the
humanitarian results. But he couldn't be seen or suspected as
bargaining for them.
</P>
<P>
   Since Jackson talked Syria's hard-line leader, Hafez Assad, into
freeing a downed U.S. Navy pilot named Lt. Robert Goodman in 1984,
he has been the agent of rescue for hundreds of mostly humble
citizens held in military and political prisons. He talked Fidel
Castro into freeing 48 prisoners, Americans and Cubans, and
persuaded Saddam Hussein to release 500 foreign nationals being
held in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The charismatic clergyman's self-initiated forays into
negotiations have not been confined to international diplomacy. Far
more numerous, though less well-known, are times when he's
prevailed upon private business interests to dignify underpaid,
low-skilled workers with an overdue raise, to desegregate theaters
and restaurants, to open stores or extend credit in disadvantaged
neighborhoods, or to end racially discriminatory hiring practices.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse is a preacher with a worldwide parish. He refuses to be
confined. Twice he tried for the Democratic presidential
nomination, probably without expecting to win it. It gave him a
pulpit to say things he wanted to be said.
</P>
<P>
   Gifted with multiple talents, Jackson flirted briefly as a youth
with professional baseball and declined a University of Illinois
football scholarship when told that no black could go out for
quarterback. Trained as a clergyman, he now performs as a
television talk-show host. He speaks at times with a poetic cadence
and may be the best wordsmith and phrasemaker in national political
life today.
</P>
<P>
   A decade and more ago, when I was fighting the battles of
Congress, Jesse would call me occasionally with an original slogan
or pithy phrase he thought I might use to advantage. ``My
brother,'' he'd begin, ``let me tell you what you need to be
saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Jackson won't ever be president, and he is just too
independent for the average president to feel wholly comfortable
with Jesse in his Cabinet. But don't try to tell the families of
those he's rescued from captivity that he is anything short of a
fine American and a positive force for good.

THE CASE FOR DOWNSIZING TODAY'S PALATIAL HOUSES
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Architect Sarah Susanka proposes a local heresy. She says small
houses are better houses. This is not in keeping with the
prevailing Texas style, but maybe it should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all searching for home, but we are trying to find it by
building more rooms and more space,'' Susanka says. ``A house is so
much more than its size and volume, neither of which has anything
to do with comfort.''
</P>
<P>
   Can it be that three living areas plus an office and a home
theater don't buy happiness, even at today's low interest rates?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently so, for many building professionals and homeowners
are responding to Susanka's call for smaller, well-built houses.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, she spoke at the American Institute of Architects'
national convention in Dallas. It was her second podium moment of
the week; she was one of the few speakers who were invited to bat
twice.
</P>
<P>
   Susanka told the assembled throng of conservatively well-dressed
people the words they long to hear but scarcely believe: It's
possible to have a healthy business devoted to designing
residences. Her talk was titled ``Practicing Residential
Architecture: Insights From a Firm That's Made It Work.''
</P>
<P>
   Susanka is motivational. She advises people who want to spend
more than $250,000 to hire an architect. She advises architects who
want more residential projects to ``get over the hump of fear and
go after this business.''
</P>
<P>
   Susanka and her partners in the Minneapolis-based firm
Mulfinger, Susanka, Mahady &AMP; Partners do ``two to three hundred
projects a year with a staff of 40 _ all are residential or
remodeling jobs,'' she said in a recent phone interview. It's
enough work to keep them happily afloat and noticed.
</P>
<P>
   They were chosen to design the 1999 Life magazine Dream House.
The results of their efforts are in the May issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the 1999 house, we wanted an architect that is
well-respected but not untouchable, that you don't need to be a
millionaire to hire to design your house,'' says Jenny Allen,
Life's Dream House project writer. ``The firm relates to how
families live today and is smart about eliminating spaces that
don't serve us well.''
</P>
<P>
   Susanka, 42, catapulted her business into the spotlight last
fall with the publication of ``The Not So Big House: A Blueprint
for the Way We Really Live'' (Taunton Press, $30). Her philosophy
is that we need homes that are compatible with our lives. They
should serve our spiritual needs and material requirements.
</P>
<P>
   We need our kitchens and family rooms, where the family and
guests tend to congregate. We need our bedrooms at bedtime. What we
don't need is spaciousness, Susanka says. ``While you might be able
to afford a 6,000-square-foot house, you may find that building a
3,000-square-foot house that fits your lifestyle actually gives you
more space to live in.''
</P>
<P>
   People buy large houses out of a sense of entitlement, she says.
``We're very afraid of someone putting us in a small house. The
fear is `I'm not going to have enough.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, in a nutshell, we're so driven by expedience and
splendid isolation that we lose what is most important, that which
gives our lives meaning, which is connections and relationships.
This is inadvertent, not intentional. We don't have enough things
at the core when we have this bigness.''
</P>
<P>
   When Susanka talks small, people respond in a big way. Her book
was the No. 1 bestseller on home design last year. She gets massive
amounts of e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   To answer frequently asked questions, she has set up a Web site,
www.notsobighouse.com. It functions as a place where architects can
add their names and individual manifestoes.
</P>
<P>
   Aledo-based architect Richard Wintersole believes his work
probably ought to be there. ``I'm doing a 950-square-foot house
right now in Burleson. That's as not-so-big as I've ever done.''
</P>
<P>
   Wintersole had heard about Susanka's list of architects. So have
many others. The word on her is spreading publicly and through the
underground gossip conduits. Her attention has been so diverted by
the overwhelmingly positive reaction to her book, she is going to
leave the architectural firm _ it's amicable, she says _ and devote
her time to the greater interest in the not-so-big house.

   1. The formal and informal spaces are the same.
</P>
<P>
   2. Built-ins and cabinetry serve as furniture but are a natural
extension of the house.
</P>
<P>
   3. Alcoves and window seats offer homey sheltered spaces that
are connected to the room but allow for multiple activities.
</P>
<P>
   4. By raising or lowering the ceiling, spaces are enlivened and
individually defined.
</P>
<P>
   5. Because houses are filled with noise, it is good to offer a
secluded room that is acoustically isolated.
</P>
<P>
   6. A home office should be tailored to the at-home working
needs.
</P>
<P>
   7. Lights should be installed that can transfigure space.
</P>
<P>
   8. There should be a welcoming entrance for both guests and the
people who live in the house. Slipping in through the garage and
laundry room is not a positive way to enter your home.
</P>
<P>
   9. Diagonal views are manipulated to make rooms seem larger.
</P>
<P>
   10. Houses will feel bigger and more comfortable if there are
outdoor connections such as screened porches.

GENDERESE: LOOKING FOR A MASTERFUL WEBMISTRESS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release on Sunday, May 16.)  
 (Eds., items in boldface should be set in italics.)  
(js) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hypersensitivity to sexism in language can pull the punch out of
a good sentence.
</P>
<P>
   In ``All Too Human,'' his revealing and riveting White House
memoirs, George Stephanopoulos tells of his attempt to soften a
line that Dick Morris wrote for the 1996 Clinton State of the Union
address.
</P>
<P>
   The line that stole the Republicans' clothes was ``The era of
big government is over.'' A poll presumably taken by Morris showed
those words approved by 80 percent of Americans. But Stephanopoulos
thought that such a potently illiberal line, unqualified, would
make President Clinton a prisoner of conservative oratory. He and
Michael Waldman, a White House speech writer, wanted to balance it
with ``but the era of every man for himself must never begin.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrote the memoirist: ``Morris, surprisingly, didn't object; but
our political-correctness police did. ... They argued that `every
man for himself' was a sexist insult, and they appealed directly to
the president.'' Clinton neutered the sentence: ``But we cannot go
back to the time when our citizens were left to fend for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not the same,'' noted Stephanopoulos correctly. `In a
political speech, it takes a cliche to counter a cliche.''
</P>
<P>
   In wiping away the undoubted masculine tilt to a thousand years
of English, and in attempting to imbue our language with gender
equality, are we going too far too fast? Contrariwise, in making
our language reflect a belated sense of fairness, should we tell
tradition-bound male chauvinists, ``Sorry, buddy, but you can't
make an omelet without breaking eggs''? (Or contra-contrariwise,
should we use an egg metaphor at all in this discussion?)
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the advocates of linguistic sex neutrality have
indisputable logic on their side. If women are going to be firemen,
policemen and mailmen, then we're better off with  &UR; firefighter &LR; ,
 &UR; police officer &LR;  and  &UR; mail carrier &LR; . If the boss of your company is
a woman, you can't call her a  &UR; businessman &LR; ; she's an  &UR; executive &LR; ,
and if she's tall and runs a small business, get a hyphen to help
you out: she's a  &UR; tall small-business executive &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, some have sought to unsex a word but found
resistance:  &UR; chairman &LR;  went through  &UR; chairperson &LR; , which sounded
labored, to  &UR; chair &LR; , which sounded four-legged, and then to
 &UR; chairwoman &LR; , which sounded too much like  &UR; charwoman &LR; . Accordingly,
some presiding women, in a display of security, preferred to go
back to  &UR; chairman &LR; . A more satisfying solution was found to
 &UR; congressman &LR; / &UR; congresswoman &LR; / &UR; congressperson &LR; : we now give all
members of the House of Representatives the neutered title
 &UR; representative &LR; ,  &UR; rep &LR; . for short.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Humankind &LR;  has triumphed over  &UR; mankind &LR;  among the many to whom
the male does not automatically embrace the female. Thus has the
 &UR; century of the common man &LR;  become the  &UR; time of the average
person &LR; , or the  &UR; era of ordinary people &LR; . Somehow  &UR; century of the
common man &LR;  has more of a ring to it; unsexing has its drawbacks.
(The replacement of the verb  &UR; man &LR;  with  &UR; staff &LR;  suggests the order
`` &UR; Staff &LR;  the lifeboats!'' and might encourage anti-P.C. types to
go down with the ship.)
</P>
<P>
   Some gender-diktats make it; some don't. At some colleges,
 &UR; freshmen &LR;  were supposed to be called  &UR; first-year &LR;  students; that
struck most frosh as a little stiff, but &UR; freshman week &LR;  was
replaced in many places by  &UR; orientation week &LR; . ( &UR; First-year &LR;  Asian
students did not object.)
</P>
<P>
   I have long enjoyed the search for female equivalents to other
masculine words:  &UR; avuncular &LR; , for example, meaning ``genial,
kindly, familial,'' is rooted in the Latin for ``maternal uncle.''
The Nonsexist Word Finder, a sternly prescriptive dictionary of
gender-free usage, by Rosalie Maggio, directs readers to avoid the
word. OK; why can't we have a new adjective that calls up the
qualities of an aunt? (I took a crack at this coinage years ago,
rejecting the hesitant  &UR; tantitive &LR;  for the smiling  &UR; amital &LR; , based
on the Latin for ``father's sister.'' It went nowhere.)
</P>
<P>
   Finding the appropriate feminine alternative to masculine words
is not easy. How about  &UR; womanizer &LR; ? For a promiscuous female,
 &UR; loose woman &LR;  sounds dated and  &UR; slut &LR; , overly harsh;  &UR; temptress &LR; 
and  &UR; seductress &LR;  deal with technique rather than state. My
preference is  &UR; philanderer &LR; ; although based on ``love of man,'' it
imputes enjoyment of playing around to both sexes, on the analogy
of  &UR; representative &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Pronouns need special handling. By constantly personifying nouns
like judge, author, critic and executive with  &UR; he &LR; , notes the
National Council of Teachers of English, we subtly condition
ourselves against thinking of women in those roles. One way to
avoid that is to recast into the plural: ``Give each student  &UR; his &LR; 
paper as soon as  &UR; he &LR;  is finished'' can be desexed with ``Give
students  &UR; their &LR;  papers as soon as  &UR; they &LR;  are finished.'' In the
same way, ``The average judge is worried about  &UR; his &LR;  opinion being
overturned on appeal'' can be fixed as ``Most judges are worried
about  &UR; their &LR; , etc.'' When desperate, fall back on the
space-consuming  &UR; his or her &LR; . (Why don't we use  &UR; her or his &LR; ?
Relax; it's because the  &UR; s &LR;  elides more easily than the  &UR; r &LR; .)
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, one of the hottest new words in the computer world is
resolutely sexist.  &UR; Webmaster &LR;  is ``one who designs, develops,
markets and/or maintains one or more sites on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Bill Cullifer, executive director of the World
Organization of Webmasters (WOW) in Fulsom, Calif., ``the word
originally came from  &UR; postmaster &LR; . The early Webmasters were those
academics who routed electronic stuff.'' ( &UR; Stuff &LR;  is a big word
among  &UR; Webmasters &LR; .)
</P>
<P>
   But  &UR; master &LR; , from the Latin  &UR; magister &LR; , ``chief,'' has always
been associated with males, especially controlling, dominant,
insensitive fellows. Its female counterpart is  &UR; mistress &LR; ,
sometimes pronounced ``gerfren.'' Many of WOW's 7,000 members are
women; what to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``At the World Wide Web conference in Australia,'' Cullifer
says, ``some guy asked why we didn't use more inclusive language. A
female Webmaster got up and said, `If you don't like it _ too bad.'

WHO KNEW DUCT TAPE COULD MAKE SUCH COOL CRAFTS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GAILE ROBINSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was bound to happen _ eventually someone would envision the
possibilities of craft projects made entirely of duct tape.
</P>
<P>
   The world can thank Joe Wilson, 37, Canadian comic and resident
of Guelph, Ontario. ``It was a long winter, and I don't play
hockey,'' he says by way of explanation, or apology, for inventing
the duct-tape apron, tool belt, baseball cap, cellular phone holder
and bachelor's toilet-roll cover, among other clever projects.
</P>
<P>
   These are the things that MADE IT into the book. Wilson's
not-so-famous duct-tape quotes were cut:
</P>
<P>
   ``Veni, vidi, ducti'' (I came, I saw, I taped.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Carpe ducti'' (Seize the tape.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Tape it so, No. 1'' _ Capt. Jean-Luc Picard
</P>
<P>
   He's still chapped about that, though his book is full of
duct-tape minutiae such as the chapter titled ``The Role of the
Roll: A Ripping History.''
</P>
<P>
   Invented by the military during WWII to keep ammunition boxes
dry, it was a khaki-colored cloth mesh tape with a rubber-based
waterproof adhesive. It was christened gun tape. Once in the field,
soldiers found innumerable uses for the almost indestructible
product.
</P>
<P>
   The postwar desire for central air-conditioning demanded the
color change to gray to match sheet-metal ducts, and it became
known as duct tape.
</P>
<P>
   In his book's FAQ section, Wilson explains the difference in
duct tape prices. ``If you rip off a piece of tape and look at it
closely, you can actually count the number of threads. These
threads are called the `scrim.' The more threads per inch, the
stronger the tape. The stronger the tape, the more costly it is to
produce. `Military tape' has a 40-pound rip strength. Less
expensive tapes have only a 20-pound rip strength. Generally, the
more you spend on tape, the less tape you have to use.''
</P>
<P>
   The glory of the book is the projects. Most of them are
fashioned by using three basic duct-tape techniques: sheets, strips
and loops.
</P>
<P>
   The waterproof-flakproof apron uses both sheets and strips.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Materials needed:
</P>
<P>
   Duct tape
</P>
<P>
   1. Create one sheet, 26x32 inches. (Sheets are made by
overlapping layers of duct tape, working both the back and front
sides to create a double-sided, thick sheet of duct fabric.)
</P>
<P>
   2. Create three big strips: one 26 inches long for the neck
strap, one 24 inches long and one 13 inches long; these will form
the belt.
</P>
<P>
   3. Positioning your sheet vertically, mark off and cut a 7-inch
square from each side of the top of the sheet. You can attach these
squares as pockets on the front of your apron. The top of your
apron will now measure 12 inches.
</P>
<P>
   4. Attach your 26-inch strip at each corner of the 12-inch bib.
Tape the ends of the strip down firmly on the back of the apron
using about 2 inches of tape for each end. This is the neck strap.
</P>
<P>
   5. Take the 24- and 13-inch strips and attach them to the side
corners, 24-inches from the bottom. This is your belt.
</P>
<P>
   According to Wilson ``Yes, the apron is waterproof. And yes,
real men do dishes. The `flakproof' part works like this: If you
put on the apron and do the dishes, you're going to get a whole lot
less flak. Peace in our time. Once again, duct tape has a strategic
military use.''

   And even though, for a pregnant woman, the details are sometimes
nagging, God is still in the mix, she says.
</P>
<P>
   It's just hard to believe that notion at times _ such as when
the mother-to-be finds herself pulled over by the side of the road
in rush-hour traffic waiting for morning sickness to pass.
</P>
<P>
   But in her new book, ``Pregnancy: The Miracle Journey,'' Kelly
offers what she says is a reminder to pregnant women that God will
be there through nine months of great changes, small worries and
the birth of a child.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Please give me a parking place up close,' '' quips Kelly,
34, of Southlake north of Fort Worth. ``People don't know they can
pray for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspiration for writing the book came from Kelly's personal
pregnancy experience and her search for material that would
spiritually prepare her for the change in her life and body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for guidance on how to start preparing to be a
mother,'' Kelly said. ``I was trying to get it from books or
girlfriends. I couldn't find the book that would give me a
spiritual guide.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, which combines Scripture with practical advice and
space for journal writing, was released last month by Herald Press
and will be available at local bookstores, on the Internet from
Amazon.com and through the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some other (books), but I think this is a unique
package in which she puts in an opportunity for journaling and
meditation and keeping track of the pregnancy,'' said David Garber,
senior editor of the book.
</P>
<P>
   For Michelle Carlstedt, a cousin of Kelly's who used the book
while pregnant with her daughter, Brooke, now 12 weeks old, the
book offered an opportunity to document her pregnancy, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when you are pregnant, instead of thinking all the
time about how you feel and how you can't do this, that or the
other thing, the Scriptures reminded me that it is a child and how
lucky I was that I was pregnant,'' Carlstedt said.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the book is broken into three parts _ or
trimesters. Within that framework, Kelly devised monthly and weekly
subsections.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the weeks start with a personal anecdote from one of
Kelly's friends. For example, in the 29th week a friend offered
this advice:
</P>
<P>
   ``As the mother of six children, I can tell you: Change is
certain, laundry is constant, all things will pass, and stretch
marks will fade.''
</P>
<P>
   The anecdotes are followed by Kelly's observations, personal
experience and practical advice. For that 29th week, the topic was
stretch marks and vanity.
</P>
<P>
   Each week, there is also a workbook-type page with a line of
Scripture for each day. On day five of week 29, for instance, a
passage from Proverbs states: ``Charm is deceitful, and beauty is
vain, but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it was just so encouraging,'' said Grapevine resident
Suzette Evans-Roach, who tested the book for Kelly during her
pregnancy. ``It was a real good guidance to journaling while you
are pregnant to help you in prayers for the baby and yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspiration for the book came from a need Kelly said she felt
during her first pregnancy. When Kelly was pregnant with her first
son, Colton, now 5, her husband, Mike, a pilot, was away for long
periods of time. And because her mother had died of cancer when
Kelly was 16, she had to look to others for help and advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It think that what happened is I didn't have a lot of people
to talk to,'' Kelly said. ``... I just felt, `How in the world am I
going to do this?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly kept a journal of the experience, marking down changes in
her life and body. She fit in the writing as best she could,
balancing her job as a J.C. Penney fashion buyer with a first
trimester that required her to drive around with a supply of
air-sickness bags her husband supplied.
</P>
<P>
   But the physical side of pregnancy wasn't Kelly's only concern.
She also worried about how well she would handle motherhood. So she
decided she needed to address these matters from a Christian
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see shortcomings in yourself until you are going to
be fully responsible for another one,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   During her second pregnancy, with her son Clay, now 3, Kelly
said she kept a more detailed journal with the purpose of
eventually writing the book.
</P>
<P>
   With her own experience documented, Kelly looked to friends and
relatives for anecdotes and advice. She also spent six months
searching the Bible for Scripture passages that would speak to
pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   ``God wants us to be encouraged,'' said Kelly, who shopped for a
publisher until Herald Press, part of Mennonite Publishing House in
Scottdale, Pa., agreed to take the book in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Kelly said she hopes the book will remind women to
be thankful, even as they struggle with the challenges of
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can have morning sickness or just feel miserable, but we
have a choice about our spiritual attitude,'' she said.

`GIVE WAR A CHANCE' SHOWS PAST MISTAKES SURVIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
GIVE WAR A CHANCE 
Produced by: Michael Kirk and Rick Young 
Written by: Peter Boyer and Michael Kirk 
On: PBS 
Date: Tuesday at 9 p.m. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From time to time, pundits dissecting the NATO vs. Serbian war
allude to the US experience in Vietnam, but the references tend to
be fleeting and glib. Which is not to say the two conflicts aren't
disturbingly related, only that, so far as I know, no one in the
popular press has made an effort to closely examine the
connections. Until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frontline's'' scathingly titled ``Give War a Chance'' examines
today's foreign policy and military operations as products of
yesteryear's bitter and fruitless Southeast Asian war. If Vietnam
stands as a harsh, echoing lesson for our leaders, as one so often
hears it does, then who learned what and how is that knowledge
affecting us today?
</P>
<P>
   The answers this sharp, well-crafted hourlong documentary
provides may surprise you. In any case, they are enlightening,
sometimes painfully so, and are sure to amplify the debate about
NATO's (which is to say, the United States') behavior in Serbia and
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   We may not be condemned to repeat history exactly, but the
mistakes of the past are ironically embedded in current foreign
policy. This is one conclusion implied, though not stated, in
``Give War a Chance.'' Richard Holbrooke, US special envoy to the
Balkans and one of the chief architects of the NATO bombing
campaign in Serbia, seriously questioned a similar strategy in
Vietnam, where he served in 1962. Holbrooke was a patriotic young
foreign service officer delivering American aid to South Vietnamese
peasants. In his role as an adviser to President Johnson later in
the war, he considered the president's Vietnam policies ``unreal''
and our aggressive bombing ``a huge mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Give War a Chance'' reveals this ``cold-warrior-turned-dove''
turning yet again, into a reborn advocate of maximum American
military force. ``Put us down as people who want bombing for
peace,'' Holbrooke said in 1995 after Serbian mortars killed and
maimed shoppers in a Sarajevo marketplace. More recently, he
recommended bombing Belgrade and elsewhere in Serbia as a remedy
for the miseries inflicted on the Kosovars. Kosovo, of course,
continues to be purged, by murder and expulsion, of Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give War a Chance,'' which leaves that grim irony to speak for
itself, contrasts a second Vietnam-era principal, Navy flier
Leighton W. Smith, with Holbrooke. The decorated combat pilot did
his duty despite reservations about the way the war was conducted
and the lies the military was feeding the American public. He
nonetheless rose to four-star admiral and NATO commander of
southern Europe. As such, the colorful, candid ``Snuffy'' Smith
would clash dramatically with Holbrooke himself, openly questioning
the born-again hawk's bomb-it-all mentality. The hard lessons of
Vietnam were lost on civilian warriors like Holbrooke, Smith
angrily suggests.
</P>
<P>
   The military, on the other hand, radically rethought its
philosophy, eventually codifying a creed that said stay out of
conflicts unless you mean to win; use force as a last resort and
then fight only for vital national interests and only when you have
the support of both the public and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the films's general air of objectivity, it can't conceal
a creeping bias against Holbrooke and his Clinton administration
cohorts. While ``Frontline'' correspondent Peter J. Boyer speaks of
them as ``compassion warriors engaged in a kind of moral
imperialism,'' the reporting in ``Give War a Chance,'' including
incisive interviews with both Holbrooke and Smith, justifies the
critique. The bursts of polemic in the script sometimes rise to a
fiery eloquence. ``Holbrooke,'' we are told, for an example,
``believed in responding to the moment _ the magic of impulse, the
improvised shuttle trip, the negotiating point plucked from the
air. Diplomacy as jazz.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich in detail and depressing implication, ``Give War a Chance''
portrays America's Serbian policy as a war behind a war, a struggle
between an underprepared administration of ad hoc hawks and a
self-consciously cautious military chastened and changed by
Vietnam. The civilian bombers for peace are carrying the day, as we
know from news headlines.
</P>
<P>
   The picture this ``Frontline'' presents isn't pretty, but it's
revealing, exposing the dynamics of why we're in (or, more
precisely, over) Serbia and how we got there. It also instructs us
in a more general way about the often messy and adversarial
behind-the-scenes business of hammering out policy and prosecuting
a war.

FINCH DNA SHOWS DARWIN WAS RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Charles Darwin landed in the Galapagos Islands on Sept. 17,
1835, he paid little attention to the finches, which seemed much
the same from one island to another. He assumed they were varieties
of a single species that had reached the remote islands long before
and thought no more about them until after the British ship Beagle
returned to London.
</P>
<P>
   There, John Gould, a leading ornithologist, told him that the
finches belonged to many different species, none known from
anywhere else. The surprising news helped set off in Darwin's mind
the train of thought that led him to the daring conclusion that the
earth's species might not have remained fixed and unchangeable
since some moment of divine creation.
</P>
<P>
   The finches of the Galapagos Islands have become a foremost
example of evolution at work. They display what biologists call
adaptive radiation, the evolution of a founding population into an
array of different species, each adapted to its own ecological
niche.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists now have applied modern methods of DNA analysis to
Darwin's finches. Not surprisingly _ for Darwin was almost always
right, though he knew of neither genes nor DNA _ they have found
that the finches are all descended from a single ancestral species.
</P>
<P>
   There are 14 species of Darwin's finches _ 13 on the Galapagos
Islands, which lie some 600 miles west of Ecuador, and one on Cocos
Island to the north of the Galapagos. The little birds look very
similar, but each species gets its food in a different way, with a
beak adapted to its special needs.
</P>
<P>
   The cactus ground finches have long beaks for eating seeds and
cactus pulp. The sharp-beaked ground finch picks ticks off iguanas.
The woodpecker finch wields a cactus spine with its chisel-shaped
beak to force insects out of cracks.
</P>
<P>
   The strange vegetarian finch eats only buds, blossoms and fruit
with its stubby beak. This array of beaks is ``the most famous tool
kit in the natural world,'' Jonathan Weiner wrote in ``The Beak of
the Finch.''
</P>
<P>
   The most likely ancestor of the famous finches, the biologists
write in the current issue of the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, was a bird known as the dull-colored
grassquit. The first species to evolve from the grassquit line was
the warbler finch, followed by the vegetarian finch.
</P>
<P>
   The family tree then bushes out into the six species of ground
finch and the six tree finches. The Cocos finch turns out to be
closely related to the tree finches, showing the Cocos Islands were
colonized from the Galapagos.
</P>
<P>
   The biologists, a team led by Jan Klein of the Max Planck
Institute for Biology in Tubingen, Germany, say that with the DNA
region they analyzed, a segment of what is known as mitochondrial
DNA, they could not distinguish among the species of ground finch,
suggesting the different species may continue to interbreed.
</P>
<P>
   The same was true of the tree finch species. Speciation, the
process that led Darwin to his theory of evolution, may still be in
progress among the Galapagos finches.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having completed the first two phases of treatment for an early
breast cancer _ a lumpectomy and six weeks of radiation therapy _ I
have now begun the third and, in a way, the most exciting phase:
five years of daily treatment with the drug tamoxifen.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike traditional cancer chemotherapy, tamoxifen does not kill
cells and does not cause nausea and hair loss. Tamoxifen is more
like a growth regulator. It is an estrogen-like compound that acts
in the breast as an antiestrogen, preventing the natural hormone
from stimulating the growth of breast cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
   Tamoxifen has been around for about 20 years. It was first used
to treat advanced breast cancer, then to prevent recurrence of less
advanced disease. Now it is being used to prevent breast cancer
from occurring in the first place in women at high risk of
developing the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Factors that contribute to a woman's risk of developing breast
cancer include being over 60, having a family history of breast
cancer, having had a noninvasive breast cancer or precancerous
breast abnormalities, having begun to menstruate before the age of
12 and having had no children or a first child after age 30.
</P>
<P>
   I admit to being confused and disappointed when my surgeon
announced gleefully that my cancer was highly sensitive to hormone
stimulation, as indicated by a test for estrogen and progesterone
receptors on the cancer cells. To me that meant I would probably
never again be able to take postmenopausal hormones, which could
protect my heart, bones and brain from premature deterioration and
which prevented hot flashes and vaginal dryness.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon was pleased because being estrogen-receptor-positive
meant that my tumor was slower growing, and that I could reap the
maximum protection from tamoxifen, which has been shown to cut in
half the risk of recurrence of the original breast cancer as well
as the development of a second cancer in the opposite breast.
</P>
<P>
   Estrogen receptors are found in about 65 percent to 80 percent
of breast cancers in postmenopausal women and 45 percent to 60
percent of cancers in premenopausal women. The higher the level of
estrogen receptors in a woman's tumor, the greater the survival
benefit associated with taking the drug. Women whose cancers are
estrogen-receptor-negative reap some benefit from tamoxifen as
well, suggesting that the drug has other as-yet undiscovered
actions.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have indicated that five years of daily tamoxifen is
more protective than one or two years and as good or better than
taking the drug for 10 years. Its protective effects have been
shown to persist for at least five years after the drug is stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Most exciting, last year tamoxifen was shown in a study of more
than 13,000 women to reduce by 50 percent the development of a
first cancer in women considered at high risk for the disease. This
made tamoxifen the first drug found to prevent cancer, although it
is still not known for sure whether the protection is permanent.
But tamoxifen may not be helpful in women who carry
cancer-promoting mutations of the genes BrCa1 and BrCa2.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. D. Lawrence Wickerham, an oncologist at Allegheny University
in Pittsburgh and a co-leader of national tamoxifen studies, said,
``The cancers that developed in tamoxifen-treated women tended to
be smaller and were found at an earlier stage,'' meaning they were
more readily cured. Describing other benefits found in the studies,
Wickerham said: ``Women taking tamoxifen suffered fewer bone
fractures of the wrist, hip and spine and their cholesterol level
dropped by 12 to 20 percent. Furthermore, there is no evidence that
tamoxifen is associated with weight gain, depression, nausea or
cancers of the ovary, liver and gastrointestinal tract.''
</P>
<P>
   The effects of tamoxifen on the brain are unknown, though there
is no evidence of any ill effect, like memory impairment.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the good tamoxifen does, it has certain major and
minor disadvantages. Like estrogen, it raises the risk of
developing a relatively uncommon cancer of the uterus, endometrial
cancer, a disease that can be detected early through routine
monitoring and cured by surgery and, if needed, radiation therapy.
Its other serious side effect _ one that is shared by estrogen as
well _ is an increased risk of blood clots, which are occasionally
fatal. Nonetheless, Dr. V. Craig Jordan of Northwestern
University's cancer center, who did pioneering research on
tamoxifen, said the survival benefit from the drug for a woman like
me who has had breast cancer outweighs the risk of death from its
effects on the uterus and blood by about 30 times.
</P>
<P>
   Stimulation of the growth of the endometrium, or uterine lining,
which could increase the risk of cancer, occurs in a small
percentage of women who take tamoxifen. Nonetheless, women may be
advised to have a baseline uterine examination before starting
tamoxifen, followed by annual checkups to see if the drug is
stimulating growth of the endometrium. This examination can be done
in a doctor's office as an endometrial biopsy or painlessly by
transvaginal ultrasound. A woman who experiences an unusual vaginal
discharge or bleeding while on tamoxifen should report that to her
gynecologist without delay.
</P>
<P>
   On a less serious note, tamoxifen also causes hot flashes in a
quarter to a third of users and an annoying vaginal discharge in
about 5 percent to 10 percent of women. The hot flashes may
seriously disrupt a woman's life. But they usually diminish with
time, and their intensity may be diminished by daily consumption of
soy products like tofu and ground flaxseed.
</P>
<P>
   Tamoxifen, sold as Nolvadex, is the first of a new class of
drugs called SERM's, for selective estrogen receptor modulators.
These compounds compete with natural estrogen for a docking site on
cells throughout the body. When these sites, called receptors, are
occupied by tamoxifen, estrogen cannot hook on properly and exert
its usual effects.
</P>
<P>
   A more recent addition to this class is raloxifene, marketed as
Evista, which seems to share most of the characteristics, both good
and bad, of tamoxifen, and several other such drugs are in various
stages of development. The ultimate goal is to find a compound that
does all the good that estrogen does, including reducing the risk
of heart disease and osteoporosis, stimulating brain cells and
preventing menopausal symptoms, but that has none of estrogen's bad
effects, especially raising the risk of cancers of the breast and
uterus and causing blood clots.
</P>
<P>
   Raloxifene, which is approved for the prevention of bone loss,
also appears to protect the breast and heart but without
stimulating cell growth and cancer in the uterus. But like
tamoxifen, it can increase clotting and induce hot flashes, and it
is not yet known whether it is as good as or better than tamoxifen
in preventing breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   A study to determine this, called STAR (for Study of Tamoxifen
and Raloxifene), is just getting under way. The study, sponsored by
the National Cancer Institute, will involve 22,000 women and is
expected to last 5 to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment, it's too early to use raloxifene to prevent
breast cancer outside of a clinical trial,'' Wickerham said during
a teleconference sponsored by Cancer Care Inc. ``We don't yet know
raloxifene's long-term benefits or risks.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that women interested in possibly participating in
the STAR trial call the National Cancer Institute's hot line, (800)
4-CANCER, or sign on to the Web site of the National Surgical
Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (www.nsabp.pitt.edu).
</P>
<P>
   More information on tamoxifen can be found in a new paperback
book, ``Tamoxifen,'' by Dr. John F. Kessler and Greg A. Annussek
(Avon, $5.99).

   NEW YORK _ Lydia Siegel ran the Boston marathon last month and
credits some of her success to the group she meets on Tuesday
evenings in Central Park. ``It's a lot easier in the freezing rain
to meet up with a group,'' said Ms. Siegel, a 27-year-old research
assistant at Mount Sinai Medical Center. ``When people have similar
goals, it makes it much more fun, and easier to train.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the growing numbers of people running in groups, it
looks as if the loneliness of the long distance runner may be a
thing of the past. Group marathon training is expanding across the
country and running groups, health clubs, coaches and personal
trainers are becoming instrumental in providing safe and successful
venues for long distance training.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Lamppa, of the U.S.A. Track and Field Road Running
Information Center, a database for running statistics in Santa
Barbara, Calif., says the nation is in the midst of a second
running boom, which he describes as more of a participation boom
than the first, in the late 70s and early 80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of marathon runners now are less competitive,
their focus on health and fitness,'' he said. ``Part of the growth
can be attributed to the group mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamppa said nearly every one of the nation's 250 marathons has a
training group affiliated with it. ``Marathons become social
institutions in every city, and people want to be a part of it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the success of groups like Team in Training, begun by the
Leukemia Society of America with 57 chapters nationwide, and the
Galloway program, based in Atlanta, offshoots and similar programs
have popped up all over. Health clubs have caught on to the trend,
possibly as a way to lure runners back into the gym.
</P>
<P>
   Crunch in New York City has implemented a program called ``You
Can Run a Marathon,'' which offers an educational seminar series
and organized running groups.
</P>
<P>
   And the group mentality may be a key reason why marathon running
has become increasingly popular. According to a spokeswoman for the
New York City Marathon, there were a record-breaking 13,254 runners
who waited in line for a number on April 25 to participate in the
race next November, although only 7,500 numbers were given out.
</P>
<P>
   Last year only 9,871 waited in line for the 7,500 numbers. Later
this month Cincinnati will host its first marathon, The Flying Pig
Marathon, and 7,500 have signed up _ a startling number for a
first-time marathon, Lamppa said.
</P>
<P>
   The marathon training season is beginning now, and Jeff
Galloway, an Olympic runner and author of two books, including
``Marathon'' (1996, Phidipoides Publishing), will travel to 50
cities nationally to lecture to marathon training groups. ``The
most noticeable difference I see in running today compared to
running in the late 70s is that people are running together,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Keohane, who runs his own marathon training group in New
York City, said he is amazed at how drastically the marathon
training scene has changed. ``Running has become an incredibly
popular social outlet,'' he said. What he refers to as the ``middle
of the pack,'' he added, is growing rapidly because of this
mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the folks that are responsible for the boom in small
national races,'' he said. ``They all travel together and run
together and really support one another.''
</P>
<P>
   And the increasing proportion of women who are interested in
marathon running may contribute to the numbers of organized running
groups that are popping up nationally. Amby Burfoot, editor of
Runners World magazine, attests to the social running phenomenon
and recognizes the role of women. ``Women statistically are better
joiners and tend to be part of groups more often than men,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Keller, 32, a graphic designer who lives in San Francisco
couldn't imagine what it would be like running a marathon alone.
``The desire to share the experience, from beginning to end is
powerful,'' she said. ``It just feels natural to be with others
along the way.''

   Q. How do people get a tan?
</P>
<P>
   A. Exposure to the sun's ultraviolet radiation darkens granules
of the pigment called melanin in the surface layers of the skin.
Part of the radiation also stimulates pigment-producing cells,
called melanocytes, in deeper layers of the skin, causing a
delayed-reaction tan, about three days after exposure.
</P>
<P>
   When the top layers of skin wear off, so does the tan.
</P>
<P>
   All adults have about 60,000 melanocytes per square inch of
skin. Skin color is determined by how much pigment the cells make
and what color it is; it ranges from black to light tan. Other
factors that stimulate melanin production include X-rays, heat,
certain chemicals, hormones and drugs (usually in combination with
sun exposure) and inflammatory skin diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Dermatologists warn that tanning goes hand in hand with skin
aging and a higher risk of skin cancer. Ultraviolet B, or UVB,
radiation, the so-called burning rays, is the kind most sun
products protect against. They usually offer little protection
against the ultraviolet A, or UVA rays, the so-called tanning rays.
These are the rays that affect deeper layers of the skin, causing
the breakdown of supporting tissue, resulting in premature aging,
wrinkling and a leatherlike appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Some newer sun blocks protect against both kinds of radiation,
but nothing works as well as avoiding midday sun exposure
altogether and wearing a hat and long sleeves.

TRUTH BE TOLD, IT'S NOT EASY TO SPOT A LIAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(lh) 
 By ERICA GOODE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 10 men on the videotape look earnest enough. Each appears
for two minutes, stating his opinions on an important social issue
_ capital punishment, for example, or anti-smoking laws _ then
explaining to an ``interrogator'' why he thinks as he does and how
long he has held his views.
</P>
<P>
   The task of the person watching the video is to tell which of
the men are lying and which are telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Sound fairly easy? Most people think it does. They are confident
of their ability to detect falsehood. Living in a society where
lies of every stripe are commonplace _ in one study, people
confessed to telling at least one lie per day; college students
admitted to two _ chances to observe liars in action abound. And if
the opportunities for lie detection at the breakfast table have
been exhausted, there is always the corner bar _ or the Oval
Office.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as it turns out, the exercise presented by the videotape is
not so easily disposed of. In study after study, Dr. Paul Ekman, a
professor of psychology in the School of Medicine at the University
of California at San Francisco, and his colleagues have
demonstrated that most people perform miserably on the test,
scoring at chance levels or only slightly higher, although for each
liar on the tape a variety of clues were present that might have
revealed the lies.
</P>
<P>
   Even groups one might expect to possess particular lie-catching
abilities _ police officers, trial court judges, FBI and CIA
agents, trial lawyers, forensic psychiatrists _ score poorly, Ekman
has found, demonstrating little more skill at picking out
prevaricators than a pipe fitter or bus driver pulled from the
street.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers confirm this discouraging assessment. In a
review of 120 studies of lie detection, for example, Dr. Bella
DePaulo, a professor of psychology at the University of Virginia,
found only two that reported subjects scoring at higher than 70
percent; eight studies reported scores of 63 percent or better.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the work of researchers like Dr. DePaulo and Ekman, whose
most recent study appears this month in the journal Psychological
Science, while painting a dreary picture of the ability of people
to perceive deception, also raises intriguing questions. Are people
better at detecting the lies of strangers than those of people
close to them? Can training improve lie catchers' scores? And
perhaps most interesting: Why, among the multitudes of maladroit
lie detectors, are there a few people who appear to be
spectacularly good at spotting lies?
</P>
<P>
   Ekman, who specializes in studying ``high stakes'' lies, and
uses his findings in training law-enforcement groups, has
identified what he calls his ``Diogenes sample,'' people who
regularly score close to 100 percent on lie-detection tests. Some
occupational groups also seem better at nailing liars than others:
U.S. Secret Service agents, Ekman and his colleagues have found,
score significantly above average, perhaps because of their
training.
</P>
<P>
   And in the study published this month with Dr. Maureen
O'Sullivan of the University of San Francisco and Dr. Mark Frank of
Rutgers University, Ekman reports on two other groups _ federal law
officers and clinical psychologists with an interest in deception _
who performed better than chance and better than other
psychologists and law-enforcement officers on the lie detection
test.
</P>
<P>
   What these expert lie catchers have in common, Ekman said, is
that unlike most people, they do not rely on any single clue _ a
lack of eye contact, for example, or throat clearing _ to tell them
if someone is lying. Rather, nimble lie detectors notice and
interpret clusters of verbal and nonverbal signals that liars often
give out.
</P>
<P>
   These signals, which differ for each liar and are virtually
undetectable in very skilled liars, can indicate the leakage of
emotions the liar would rather keep hidden: guilt, despair, anger,
fear, distress, embarrassment or ``duping delight,'' the glee some
liars feel at deceiving their targets.
</P>
<P>
   Some clues to discrepant emotions may be vocal _ shifts in
pitch, for example, speech errors or pauses. Others are nonverbal:
A ``micro expression'' of anger, for example, might flash across
the face of a man who is insisting that he is delighted to
cooperate with a police investigation. Or a woman might shake her
head almost imperceptibly while telling her supervisor
(untruthfully) that she has completed her work assignment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In his 1992 book, ``Telling Lies'' (W.W. Norton), Ekman gives
the example of a graduate student being harshly interrogated by her
professor as part of an experiment on nonverbal behavior. Although
the woman did not appear angry, Ekman writes, a film of the
interaction revealed a telltale gesture: for one full minute, her
middle finger was extended in an age-old expression of outrage.
</P>
<P>
   No single signal, Ekman is quick to point out, is a sure-fire
sign of deceit, and the presence of discrepant emotions per se does
not necessarily mean someone is lying. An innocent suspect fearful
about being believed, for example, may leak evidence of anxiety or
apprehension. The lie catcher must evaluate the meaning of the
signals in each individual case.
</P>
<P>
   Why some people are more adept at picking up clues to deception
remains largely a matter of speculation. Secret Service agents,
Ekman suggests, may benefit from their job training in protection,
scanning large crowds for a single suspicious looking character.
And at least one study in the 1980s found that giving subjects
feedback improved their ability to detect lies told by the people
they were trained on. But many top-notch lie catchers seem to
possess an inherent skill that is independent of any training.
``I'd like to know how they do it,'' Ekman said. ``Is this
something in their constitution? Is it how they were brought up?''
</P>
<P>
   Lie-detecting ability can prove useful in a wide range of
situations, from interviewing applicants for jobs that involve
sensitive or classified material, to deciding whether to go on a
date. But in some cases, it is equally important to detect the
truth, and even expert lie catchers seem less able in this regard.
In their new study, Ekman and his colleagues found that the groups
who did best in detecting lies were less effective in identifying
truth tellers, scoring not much better than chance, and not
significantly better than other groups. ``That worries me,'' Ekman
said, ``because in law enforcement, if you guessed that everybody
was lying, you'd be right 80 percent of the time. The real issue is
how can I teach people not to make mistakes on those truthful
people, who are accused incorrectly _ those are the critical ones
you don't want to make a mistake on.''
</P>
<P>
   One difficulty in studying lie detection, researchers say, is
that experiments are rarely able to replicate the motivations and
pressures to succeed that liars experience in real life. In an
effort to remedy this, Ekman and his colleagues offered the
volunteer liars in their studies a $50 reward if they succeeded in
convincing the interviewer that they were telling the truth. Truth
tellers in the study were given $10 if they were believed. If the
liars or the truth tellers failed to convince the interviewer, they
received no money, and half also received a punishment: 40 blasts
of white noise administered in a dark room the size of a telephone
booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the real world,'' Ekman said, ``if a jury doesn't believe
you, you go to jail, and if your wife doesn't believe you, she
leaves you.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the husbands, however, Dr. DePaulo's research on
lying in everyday life indicates that they have a good chance of
maintaining their deceit undetected. It might seem that people
should be better at recognizing deception in those they know well,
``but it doesn't always come out that way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in a relationship, you not only have the
experience in knowing the other person, you have certain
motivations to see your partner in a particular way, and you
especially don't want to think that they are lying to you,'' Dr.
DePaulo said.
</P>
<P>
   In one study, Dr. D. Eric Anderson, a researcher in Dr.
DePaulo's laboratory, had subjects watch their romantic partners
describe another person as attractive or unattractive. Other
subjects who did not know the romantic partner also watched the
interaction.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was surprised to discover that the subjects with the
romantic attachment were considerably worse at spotting their
partners' lies than were the strangers. If the romantic partners
were asked indirect questions, however, such as how suspicious they
were, or if they got enough information from their partners, the
answers revealed that at some level they had picked up the
deception, and picked it up better than strangers did.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you answer this kind of question,'' Dr. DePaulo said,
``you don't have to say directly `my partner is a liar.' There was
a sense that they got it, but they either didn't know, or wouldn't
say that they got it.''
</P>
<P>
   In another study, Dr. Anderson, Dr. DePaulo and their colleagues
studied same-sex pairs of undergraduates who had been friends for
about a month. Each friend was asked to tell the other a series of
life stories, some of which were true, and some of which were lies.
Five months later, the exercise was repeated.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that after being friends for six months,
men in the study were still unable to tell when the other person
was lying. Women, however, got slightly better, detecting lies with
accuracy levels of about 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. DePaulo has recently moved from studying everyday lies into
investigating serious lies, involving devastating betrayals of
trust. In a study of 66 college students and 107 community
residents, the subjects were asked to reveal the most serious lie
they had ever told, and the most serious lie they had been told by
another person.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the most common of such lies were about
affairs. But the subjects also confessed to telling lies about
money, about the death of someone close to them and they admitted
to lying to employers when they felt they deserved something, like
money, credit or time off.
</P>
<P>
   Some subjects in the study recalled lies they had told on dates
50 years before. They still felt guilty, Dr. DePaulo said. But
perhaps the most impressive falsehoods, she added, were those told
by people who were actually ``living a lie.'' One woman in the
study got divorced, moved to another town and for 20 years told her
co-workers that ``she had to go home and cook dinner for her
husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the average person's skill at telling if someone is lying,
they probably believed her.

TWO BRAIN CIRCUITS IS KEY TO DURING MATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: In 10th graf:   Others cannot, etc., the (plus) word should
be replaced with the symbol)  
 af)  
 By SANDRA BLAKESLEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ability to do mathematics _ everything from simple
arithmetic to thinking up equations that explain an expanding
universe _ may stem from the interaction of two brain circuits that
handle numbers differently, two scientists have found.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of experiments involving bilingual college students,
the researchers discovered that one circuit gives names to numbers
and carries out exact calculations. A second circuit operates
intuitively and is used for estimating quantities and other
numerical relationships.
</P>
<P>
   During human evolution, they suggest, these two brain areas
combined forces and gave rise to the remarkable human capacity for
manipulating numbers arithmetically. Their interaction may also
underlie many kinds of advanced mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stanislas Dehaene, a neuroscientist at the National
Institute for Health and Medical Research (known as Inserm) in
Orsay, France, and Dr. Elizabeth Spelke, a cognitive psychologist
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Mass.,
described the results of their study in last week's issue of
Science magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brian Butterworth, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at
University College London, hailed the new work as ``virtuoso
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Their experiments reveal the brain's numerical processes in
unprecedented detail,'' said Butterworth, who is the author of
``What Counts: How Every Brain Is Hardwired for Math,'' to be
published in August by the Free Press.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently little has been known about how the human brain
actually does math. In the past, Dehaene said, ``the only source of
information about the mental representations used in mathematics
was the introspection of mathematicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Some mathematicians and scientists say language is crucial. But
Albert Einstein, for example, once said, ``words or language, as
they are written or spoken, do not seem to play any role in my
mechanism of thought.''
</P>
<P>
   More recent experiments have provided hints about where and how
mathematical knowledge is embedded in the brain. Studies show that
rhesus monkeys have a number sense and that chimps can use symbols
for numbers. Birds and rats can count. Human infants can detect
changes in the number of objects in an array, suggesting they have
a number sense.
</P>
<P>
   At the opposite end of the scale, stroke patients can lose
aspects of their ability to do arithmetic, Dehaene said. For
example, some cannot decide what number falls between 2 and 4 or
whether 9 is closer to 10 or 5, yet they can easily rattle off
multiplication tables.
</P>
<P>
   Others cannot decide if 2(plus)2 equals 3 or 4 but if asked
which number they prefer as an answer _ 3 or 9 _ they choose 3.
From these clues, Dehaene postulated that within elementary
arithmetic, there are at least two circuits for representing a
number. One is language based. It stores tables of exact arithmetic
knowledge, like the multiplication tables. The second is
independent of language. It represents number magnitudes and has
been called a mental ``number line'' used to approximate and
manipulate quantities.
</P>
<P>
   To test this idea, Dr. Spelke asked volunteers who were fluent
in Russian and English to solve a series of arithmetic problems.
One group was schooled in Russian, the other in English. One set of
the math problems involved exact calculations: does 53 plus 68
equal 121 or 127? Another set of problems involved approximating
answers: is 53 plus 68 closer to 120 or 150?
</P>
<P>
   When approximating answers, both groups performed the same
whether they were tested in English or Russian, Dehaene said. But a
different pattern emerged for exact calculations. When those taught
in Russian were tested in English or vice versa, he said, the
volunteers needed up to a full second or more to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers concluded that knowledge about exact problems is
stored in a language area because subjects had to translate
internally to solve the problem. But in approximating answers, no
translation time is required, suggesting that this ability is
stored independently from language.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed that the dissociation could be so sharp,''
Dehaene said. ``We presented our subjects with tasks that are
superficially extremely similar. Our brains really solve these two
tasks in quite different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, the researchers gave similar tests in exact and
approximate arithmetic to French college students and used imaging
techniques to to see which areas of their brains were active. When
approximating answers, their parietal lobes lit up.
</P>
<P>
   These are regions on both sides of the brain that carry out
visual and spatial tasks. It is where the mind makes analogies,
guides hand and eye movements, rotates objects mentally and orients
attention. When doing exact calculations, on the other hand, the
left frontal lobe lit up the most. This is where the brain
associates verbs and nouns and carries out other language tasks.
</P>
<P>
   To rule out the possibility that people first use one area and
switch to the other, the researchers took another set of brain
images using a technique that captures the timing of events in
hundredths of a second. They could see that the parietal and
frontal circuits operate independently in doing the different kinds
of arithmetic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Dehaene said that the new findings cannot determine which
children are naturally better at math. Nor do they herald big
changes in the way math is taught. The sole factor known to predict
exceptional expertise in any field, Butterworth said, is hard work.
</P>
<P>
   It looks like humans are ``born with a start-up kit for
numbers,'' Butterworth said, and must practice, just as musicians
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can recognize or identify the number of things in an
array,'' he said. ``If we see cows in a field, we see the threeness
of cows without counting, just like seeing the brownness of cows
without consciously thinking about color. We are also born with the
ability to select the larger of two numbers. What's unique about
humans is that we have developed a range of cultural tools which
upgrade or add to this start-up kit. We've invented words for
numbers and notations like decimals. And that gave rise to
mathematical ability.''

HOSPITALS REACHING NEW PATIENTS ON LINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa., Iowa, Minn.)   (af)  
 By LISA NAPOLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the Internet grows, so does the amount of health information
available on line. But the sheer volume of information available on
the Web does not equal a speedy, or accurate, search.
</P>
<P>
   To give order to the chaos of the Web, a handful of health-care
organizations have put their imprimaturs on information-rich Web
sites accessible to anyone with a modem.
</P>
<P>
   While many medical centers use Web sites to advertise practical
information like hours, resources and the latest research, others
consider themselves full-fledged digital publishers, in the
business of educating patients as much as promoting themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The growing interest in acquiring medical information is what
fueled the idea, said Ann Metzger, a spokeswoman for the University
of Pittsburgh Medical Center (www.upmc.edu), which offers
information about the university's medical specialties like gene
therapy, stroke treatment and minimally invasive surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that many people increasingly want information
when they want it,'' Ms. Metzger said. ``The Web is the ultimate
expression of that.'' To keep up with the demand, the hospital now
spends less time and money creating printed brochures in favor of
making more educational materials available on line.
</P>
<P>
   The Mayo Clinic has long provided books, newsletters, and
recently, CD-ROMs of health information. Now, it also maintains a
Web site (www.mayohealth.org), with a dozen full-time editorial
workers who publish medical news daily. Each story is reviewed by
at least three physicians, said Dr. Brooks Edwards, the medical
editor for the site.
</P>
<P>
   It also gives access to medical expertise to people far beyond
the area the clinic's location. In a busy month, doctors at the
Mayo Clinic see 40,000 patients, Edwards said. But a busy month on
the Internet brings 1.5 million visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Other online health centers report a wide geographic reach. The
University of Iowa Medical Center said only 10 percent of the
visitors to its Virtual Hospital Web site (www.vh.org) are from the
state. Twenty percent are from outside the country. The Virtual
Hospital contains digital versions of hundreds of medical textbooks
and research reports, said Dr. Michael D'Alessandro, a co-founder
and its director. In essence, it opens the bookshelves of the staff
at the medical center to the world.
</P>
<P>
   Making such data available introduces a new dimension to
medicine. In an age of easily accessible medical information, the
sight of patients in hospitals and doctors' waiting rooms clutching
printouts of information mined from various Web sites is common.
Armed with knowledge, patients are also filled with questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web breaks down barriers,'' D'Alessandro said. ``It
becomes more of a partnership or collaboration.'' But, he added,
doctors who do not understand the online medium sometimes become
frustrated. To address that frustration, some hospitals have
initiated training programs to teach health care workers about the
Web and the vast information and misinformation available on it.
</P>
<P>
   But even with an abundance of information, the Web should
supplement, not replace, advice and diagnosis from a physician,
Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   As medical knowledge expands, so do Web sites. Ms. Metzger of
the Pittsburgh medical center said her hospital's site was a ``work
in progress that would never be completed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People expect deeper information, the most current
information,'' she said. ``And that gives organizations like mine a
responsibility to put up the most comprehensive information we
can.''

   WASHINGTON _ During a forest fire, most insects and animals flee
in all directions _ flying, running, crawling and using every
possible means to avoid the deadly flames. But there are
exceptions, like some jewel beetles.
</P>
<P>
   These insects are fire seekers. Fire in the woods, particularly
if certain tree species are burning, draws them from miles away. So
intense is their interest that firefighters are sometimes hampered
by swarms of the flying beetles, which swirl around in a
distracting mass or latch onto the humans with their powerful
mandibles.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly strange conduct of these fire beetles, as they are
sometimes called, is not an exercise in self-destruction but an
example of evolutionary behavior aimed at perpetuating their
species, scientists say. And some scientists believe people can
capitalize on their behavior and the body parts they use to detect
fire or sense chemicals in the environment.
</P>
<P>
   In their fire-seeking frenzy, flying into flames or crawling
along still-smoldering trees, the beetles may be trying to beat
competitors to weakened or dying trees so that they are the first
to plant their eggs into them, researchers believe. To do that,
though, the beetles must be able to find burning trees and get to
them quickly. While it has been known for decades that these
insects have infrared detectors that allow them to sense the heat
of fires, new research by German scientists indicates they also
possess highly sensitive detectors in their antennas that allow
them to sense minute amounts of volatile substances in smoke from
burning wood.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stefan Schuetz of the Justus Liebig University in Giessen,
Germany, and colleagues say this highly sensitive smoke detection,
coupled with their heat sensors, appears to be part of a system
that allows the beetles to sense fires and home in on them from
distances of more than 30 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a complex interplay with the infrared system that we
do not fully understand,'' Schuetz said, ``but we think detecting
the smoke may be an early indication to the beetle that there is a
fire in the area.'' The beetles are often found in hilly places
where there may not be the clear line of sight to a fire that is
needed by their heat detectors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be that if they detect the odor of a fire they fly up
and look around,'' Schuetz said. The insects may also follow a
wispy trail of smoke until their infrared detectors locate the
blaze and guide them to it, he added.
</P>
<P>
   E. Richard Hoebeke, a beetle expert in the entomology department
at Cornell University said the German work was ``new and exciting''
but also showed how much people had to learn about insects.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did these beetles develop their ability to lay eggs this
way?'' Hoebeke asked. ``Think about how little we know of insects
with incredibly sensitive and complex sensory mechanisms.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Daniel Young, director of the insect research collection at
the University of Wisconsin's entomology department, said many
beetle species found in the United States and Canada exhibited
fire-seeking behavior, looking for stressed or dying trees in which
to plant their eggs, so their larvae could develop in or under the
bark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trees that are healthy have chemicals, such as pitch, to
attack a parasite and the strength to resist invasion,'' Young
said. ``Those that are weakened, dying or dead are more acceptable
hosts for insect pests.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of these invading insects prefer certain trees for food or
egg-laying, experts said, and attack only that species or closely
related species.
</P>
<P>
   Jewel beetles belong to a family of insects called Buprestidae,
hard-shelled creatures named for their shiny, metallic &UR; - &LR; looking
shells, often dabbed with bright colors or spots. The fire beetle
studied by the German researchers, a species called Melanophila
acuminata, with a less dazzling charcoal color is common in
temperate zones of the Northern Hemisphere, including large areas
of Europe and North America.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William G. Evans, an entomologist who studied the insects 30
years ago as a professor at the University of Alberta in Edmonton,
Canada, said he was gratified that scientists were continuing to
study the beetles, but not too surprised by their findings. ``All
insects have olfactory organs in their antennas,'' he said, ``and
you would almost expect the beetles to detect smoke.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In earlier research, Evans discovered that Melanophila acuminata
had a pair of thoracic pit organs that were sensitive infrared
receptors, guiding the insect to fires.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the German team involved in the antenna work, Helmut
Schmitz and Horst Bleckmann of Friedrich Wilhelm Rhineland
University in Bonn, Germany, have continued work on the heat
receptors.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said the theory that smoke activated the beetles' hunt for
a fire was plausible, but that locating burning trees was primarily
the function of the infrared detectors.
</P>
<P>
   In a report published in March in the British journal Nature,
Schuetz and his colleagues said they removed antennas from the
beetles, dipped them in an electricity-conducting liquid that
contained nutrients and connected them to instruments that measured
electrical changes in the fluid. The antennas were exposed to
volatile chemicals from smoldering pieces of wood and the reactions
generated by thousands of sensory hairs on the antennas were
measured by electrical changes.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that the antennas were particularly
sensitive to phenolic compounds found in wood smoke, and that the
reaction was pronounced for a species of pine tree, Pinus
sylvestris, it particularly favored. The antennas detected
combustion derivatives in concentrations as low as a few parts per
billion, the researchers reported. They estimated that this
sensitivity would allow a beetle to detect the smoldering bark of a
single pine tree in light wind from a distance of more than half a
mile.
</P>
<P>
   Similar tests on the antennas of three other beetles, including
two that attack weakened trees, showed much lower sensitivity to
combustion compounds, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
   Most forest fires occur in the autumn, Schuetz said, and this is
when the beetles lay most of their eggs. The eggs require a cooling
period to hatch, which they do after the winter frost, and the
larvae develop in the spring. Another curiosity about the beetle's
reproductive cycle is that only 65 percent of the eggs hatch, he
said, and the other third lie dormant for a year. Of these
remaining eggs, two-thirds hatch the following year, and the rest
stay inactive for yet another year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beetles need forest fires to propagate, and this appears
to be a protective mechanism to keep the species going through
years when there are no fires,'' Schuetz said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said that understanding how the beetles detected
fires could have practical applications, particularly in developing
new types of fire alarms and early warning detectors for forest
fires. Schuetz said his group was working with his university's
physics institute on a bio-sensor for fire warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Current fire alarms that look at carbon dioxide levels or
combustion volatiles can be fooled by automobile fumes and other
gases, he said, and the group is trying to develop a hybrid system
using electronics and biological sensors to detect specific
by-products of smoldering fires. They are testing a prototype
bio-sensor that uses transistorized components and actual beetle
antennas, he said, and are trying to isolate and identify the
proteins in the insect antennas that react to smoke so that they
can be used in more advanced devices.

FAITH SURVIVES THE RUIN OF OKLAHOMA STORMS

<P>
   MIDWEST CITY, Okla. _ The sanctuary was shattered, but the
spirit remained intact.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Sooner Baptist Church gathered in an outdoor worship
service on Mother's Day to reinforce their faith and to demonstrate
their unfettered resolve on the first Sunday after a series of
killer tornadoes pummeled the Oklahoma City and surrounding
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very important to remind ourselves that our church is
not the building, that the church is the people,'' the Rev. John
Coker said moments before he conducted a service for about 150
parishioners in the small, tight-knit congregation.
</P>
<P>
   The services were held in the parking lot because a twister
demolished the 51-year-old church. A heap of pulverized bricks,
splintered wood and mangled steel was the backdrop for the prayers.
</P>
<P>
   A wooden cross that used to hang above the church organ was
propped up with several bricks on top of the rubble, and an
American flag and another bearing a cross flapped in the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   A telling banner was fastened to the remnants of a church wall:
``The God of heaven shall prosper us, therefore we, his servants,
will arise and build. _ Nehemiah 2:20.''
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen recovered church pews and dozens of assorted
folding chairs provided most of the seating for the congregation.
Several children sat on blankets that had been spread across the
paved lot.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the congregation in its service were 55 uniformed
members of a crisis response team known as ALERT, a Christian-based
organization of young volunteers who help with disaster clean-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the church is the people, then we've not lost a thing,''
Coker said, motioning toward the congregation. He noted that
despite the destructive force of the tornado that struck this
community east of Oklahoma City on May 3, none of the congregation
members was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Although the death toll in the Oklahoma City area was more than
40, Coker said he was amazed thousands of lives were spared. The
twisters had sliced across the city in some of its most heavily
populated areas.
</P>
<P>
   Among those escaping unscathed were five members of one family
who had sought refuge in the church nursery after they saw the
approaching storm. Although the tornado demolished the church, the
family members were unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   Coker said that harrowing episode was a testament that God was
watching over his congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to remind us that whenever God is involved with
his people, his people are going to be OK,'' Coker said. ``He's
protected us and He'll also help us rebuild this thing _ and build
it back a little bit better.''
</P>
<P>
   The pastor praised members of his congregation, a handful of
whom lost their homes to tornadoes. Many members had lived for
years in the neighborhood's modest homes a short distance from
Tinker Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   ``These folks are stable and have a strong faith. They are not
high-strung and reactive,'' Coker said. ``A lot of them are from
the generation that went through the Great Depression and World War
II _ they have a character about them that knows how to handle
adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   A member of the congregation echoed that resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very important for us to be here today. You need to be
together when something like this happens,'' said Charles Guidry, a
member of the congregation. ``We are very small, but we are very
devoted.''

WICHITA FALLS RELIVES TRAUMA AFTER TORNADOES IN OKLAHOMA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By D'ANN MABRAY SHIPPY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ The stillness inside Fay and Lee Hogle's
bathroom was eerie. No movement. No sound.
</P>
<P>
   Then it hit, hammering the house. The roof was torn from the
walls, and seconds later, dropped back into place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't recall what I heard before the silence. That puzzles
me,'' said Fay Hogle, 84. ``My husband said it sounded like a
train.''
</P>
<P>
   It was ``Terrible Tuesday,'' April 10, 1979, in Wichita Falls.
The day a mammoth tornado cut an 8-mile-long swath through the
city, killing 45 people, injuring 1,702 and leaving 20,000
homeless. It was strikingly similar to the tornadoes that
demolished parts of Oklahoma City and nearby towns last week,
killing more than 40 people, flattening houses and shredding the
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The images make Fay Hogle's heart ache.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cry with them. Just seeing it, I relived it. You can't help
it, and that's been 20 years ago. ... I don't care to talk about
it,'' she said, taken aback by unexpected tears. ``Isn't that odd?
I thought I was over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wichita Falls has rebuilt its neighborhoods, shops and municipal
buildings, and survivors' physical scars have healed. But even for
those such as the Hogles, who said their experience was less
traumatic than that of many of their neighbors, Terrible Tuesday
left an indelible mark.
</P>
<P>
   How survivors of trauma _ from violent crime to tornadoes _ cope
and rebuild their lives varies from person to person, experience to
experience, said Mary Grace, a senior research associate in the
psychiatry department at the University of Cincinnati and a
founding member of the International Society of Traumatic Stress
Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Some appear unaffected, others experience long-term numbness and
avoidance _ subtle indications of post-traumatic stress disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Most fall somewhere in the middle. These are the people who
initially experience nightmares or are overly vigilant, for
example, checking the sky regularly after surviving a tornado.
</P>
<P>
   That will happen to the Oklahoma tornado victims, said Jeremiah
Davidson, 29, a survivor of the Wichita Falls tornado.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's far from over for them. I can tell you right now that
they'll be watching the skies, and every time a storm blows up,
they'll be nervous. They've got a right to be,'' Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   But in time they, like the Wichita Falls tornado survivors, will
``re-establish their psychological equilibrium,'' Grace said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not to say there won't be lingering effects,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wichita Falls tornado survivor Lori McConnell, 24, knows about
lingering effects.
</P>
<P>
   The 1979 tornado hit at dusk, just after her mother, Cathy
Grimes, finished her afternoon paper route. After spotting the
black funnel cloud, Grimes grabbed 4-year-old Lori and Lori's
18-month-old sister, Lacy, put them inside her Ford Pinto, and
headed for her husband's office.
</P>
<P>
   They never made it.
</P>
<P>
   As debris blew by, Grimes pulled the car over and ran with the
girls into a ditch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom was holding Lacy under her, and she had a hold of my
wrist. My feet were off the ground,'' McConnell said. ``Then I
guess her adrenalin just kicked in, and she yanked me under her
until the storm had passed.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, McConnell said she prepared for future tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I packed up all my prized possessions _ my Nancy Drew books
and a letter from my Grandma. And whenever the (warning) sirens
would go off, I grabbed them and ran to my neighbor's cellar,''
McConnell said. ``It really had an effect on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, McConnell said she makes sure to place her children in
day-care centers that have a storm shelter or a basement.
</P>
<P>
   The lingering effects on longtime Wichita Falls resident L.E.
Williamson are even more conspicuous.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson, 76, keeps 25 one-gallon milk jugs full of fresh
water, as well as a kit with two oil lamps, a battery-powered
radio, a flashlight and candles. And during tornado season, he
makes certain that his automobiles have a full tank of gas, which
was a rare commodity for days after Terrible Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He also always pays attention to the birds, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Comanche Indian told me once that if you can look outside
and not see any birds, to get worried,'' Williamson said. ``You'll
notice that after a tornado, you don't see any dead birds around.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Holster was a 17-year-old high school senior working at
Kmart when the Wichita Falls tornado hit. The store was only
partially damaged, but her family's house was destroyed. They
survived because they got inside a cellar, but they had to use the
weight of their bodies to keep the door shut against the powerful
winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband and my daughter think I'm crazy, but because of
that, I had a lock put on the inside of a closet inside our
house,'' Holster said. ``And when bad weather starts brewing, I put
my jewelry in a Baggie and grab my purse and go inside.''
</P>
<P>
   But because everyone responds differently to trauma, there are
some who purport to be unfazed by calamity.
</P>
<P>
   And that's OK, Grace said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a reasonable response,'' Grace said. ``There might be
some people whose defenses have them bounce right back and say,
`Everything is fine.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Grace knows about trauma's long-term effects. Until 1991, she
and a team of psychiatric professionals studied the survivors of a
1972 dam break that killed 165 people in a small community in West
Virginia. Without warning, water swept through the narrow valley,
pulling babies from their parents' arms and drowning skilled
swimmers.
</P>
<P>
   She has made 30 trips to the area, and she said her findings
show that most people improve, especially children.
</P>
<P>
   The key to recovery? Talking _ with family, friends, neighbors,
clergy, hairdressers, Grace said.
</P>
<P>
   Wichita Falls residents have done a lot of that over the years.
Everyone has a story to tell, and they do. They have seen the black
clouds. They have walked neighborhoods that have no recognizable
landmarks, forcing them to count streets to find any remnant of
their houses. They have mourned the loss of human life, and still
do.
</P>
<P>
   And they say it has made them stronger. The Oklahoma tornado
victims will be stronger for it, too, Holster said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wichita Falls can relate. We know,'' she said.

   Chicken and cow manure, old newspapers, straw and wood chips can
be used to clean up land contaminated with dangerous chlorinated
pesticides such as DDT, according to Canadian scientists at the
life sciences firm AstraZeneca.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a practical way to clean up contaminated land is tricky.
Digging up soil and moving it elsewhere is no longer acceptable,
sealing it in a landfill site is now illegal in the United States,
and heating it in massive kilns to burn off offending pesticides is
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The team at AstraZeneca has come up with an alternative, using
local bacteria that feed on organic waste to break down hazardous
substances into less harmful byproducts in a process called
bioremediation. The soil bacteria convert chlorinated pesticides to
less toxic byproducts by using enzymes known as dehalogenases to
chop out offending chlorine groups.
</P>
<P>
   They hope the landowners in the United States who are liable for
cleaning up tens of thousands of contaminated sites, such as old
chemical plants, will adopt their technique.
</P>
<P>
   The AstraZeneca researchers mixed tainted soil with large
amounts of the waste to make what was effectively a huge compost
heap. The soil was tilled and aerated every few weeks, which
provided both the nutrients and a cycle of alternating anaerobic
and aerobic conditions for local bacteria to degrade the
pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   In a yearlong test at an old pesticide factory in Tampa, Fla.,
AstraZeneca's process, called Xenorem, cut DDT levels in the soil
by more than 95 percent. DDT is considered one of the worst
pollutants because its breakdown products, such as DDE, were
thought to be almost indestructible. But recent research has shown
that DDE can be degraded and in the Tampa trial the bacteria
reduced levels of DDE, DDD and other chlorinated pesticides to
below U.S. Environmental Protection Agency safety limits. Earlier
trials using pollutants marked with radiocarbon confirmed that the
detection rates were accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Stauffer Management Company, a subsidiary of AstraZeneca, has
patented the technology, which it presented to a bioremediation
symposium in San Diego last week. The company is now modifying the
process so that it can break down other persistent organic
pollutants such as PCBs and TNT (see report below).
</P>
<P>
   The new technique will remove contaminants at around half to
two-thirds of the price of incineration, the next best solution,
says Frank Peter, AstraZeneca's director of environmental services.
It can also be carried out on site and is environmentally friendly,
using natural waste products to help indigenous bacteria gobble up
pollutants. ``It solves two problems at once,'' he says. &QL;

 &HT;    Volunteers recall despair in Albanian refugee camps
 &HT;    By Robert Sims
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Tears come to Norman Goldblum's eyes when
recounting what he witnessed last week in one Ethnic Albanian
refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tents that they are living in are absolutely horrible,''
the Palm Beach resident said. ``It might be sufficient for the
summer, but when the winter comes, I don't know what's going to
happen. And even when the conflict is over, they don't have homes
to return to. It's heart-wrenching to see the woman with their
babies. No one knows where the men are. I'm in tears just thinking
about it now. I think about it and I break up.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldblum and Mark Levy, both vice presidents of Jewish
Federation of Palm Beach County, returned Friday from a five-day
mercy mission to the Balkans coordinated by the United Jewish
Appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The mission required Goldblum and Levy to accompany 20 tons of
provisions from Israel to the refugee camp in the Albanian capital
of Tirana. Goldblum flew to the Balkans not expecting a sightseeing
tour, but he did not anticipate walking out of the refugee camp
`emotionally shook up.'
</P>
<P>
   Housed at a summer swimming resort, the refugee camp serves as
home to 5,000 ethnic Albanians forced to leave Kosovo by the
Serbian authorities. Refugees live nine to a tent, receive their
daily rations of water by the bucket, bath or shower once a week
and crowd bulletins boards hoping for news about missing loved
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Levy said, this is `one of the better-conditioned
camps,' dubbed by relief workers as the `Hilton' of refugee camps.
The refugees looked clean and dignified, Levy said, but they still
need more food, water and clothing. Relief workers forbid Goldblum
and Levy from handing out provisions on their own _ not even so
much as a candy bar _ fearing refugees would mob them.
</P>
<P>
   Provisions distributed included food, clothing and medicine. The
United Jewish Appeal, which serves as conduit for overseas funding
for Jewish Federations nationwide, has so far distributed 120 tons
of provisions to the camps and airlifted 100-plus ethnic Albanian
refugees to Israel. Relief has come from the Jewish Federation, the
Jewish Agency for Israel (JAFI) and the American Jewish Joint
Distribution Committee (JDC). The JDC has already raised $2.25
million in relief for the estimated 370,000 Ethnic Albanian
refugees in addition to the $1.25 million raised by Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Besides distributing food and clothes, Goldblum and Levy heard
stories about how armed Serbians excavated Albanian towns in a
matter of minutes. The Serbians detained men to execute or to use
as slave labor, refugees speculated.
</P>
<P>
   `One adorable little girl followed me around the camp,' said
Levy, a Palm Beach native who now lives in West Palm Beach. ``I
asked what happened to her. Through a translator, she told me that
her mother, father and brother were dead. I could not bring myself
to ask what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldblum believes the past will take care of itself, so he
restricted himself to questioning the refugees about how to
alleviate their suffering. Aside from provisions, the refugees need
permanent housing if they are to survive the blistering summer heat
and the bone-chilling winter cold.
</P>
<P>
   The men said the refugees told them that their lives are in
limbo. They want to return to Kosovo if and when the conflict ends,
even though they fear Serbian forces destroyed their homes. Yet
they do not want to live under the rule of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just don't know what's going to happen. They're in a
state of mental shock,'' Goldblum said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Levy heard the same from Yugoslavian Jews airlifted to Israel
during this and previous United Jewish Appeal relief missions. This
struck a cord in Levy. In the early 1990s, Levy visited refugees
who fled Ethiopia for Israel. The Ethiopian refugees, Levy said,
were ``looking forward to a new life in Israel. (The Yugoslavian
Jews) do not know what the future holds and they want to return to
their homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldblum and Levy returned to Israel with 30-plus young
Yugoslavian Jewish evacuees from Belgrave. The Yugoslavian Jews _
mainly women, children and the elderly _ fled to Budapest in
Hungary when NATO began bombing Belgrave. None had lost their homes
at the time they left Belgrade, but they did not feel safe in the
city. They were airlifted from a hotel used as shelter for
Yugoslavian Jews to a kibbutz north of Tel Aviv. Goldblum said they
have six weeks to decide whether they want to become Israeli
citizens or return home to Belgrade when the NATO bombing ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're Jewish,'' Levy said, ``but they don't really know
about Israel. They think Israel's a dangerous place to live
(because of tensions between Jews and Arabs). I talked to one woman
who said she could not walk down the streets of Belgrade alone at
night. I said to her that Israel is so safe that she can walks the
streets alone at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Ethnic Albania refugees, Goldblum said, the
Yugoslavian Jews do not understand why NATO targeted Belgrade for
bombing. Levy said the Yugoslavian Jews' opinions on the Kosovo
crisis has been colored by propaganda spread by the Milosevic
regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they really understand the full force of what's
going on, from the bombing to the genocide,' Goldblum said. ``They
hear what we say, but they don't seem to listen or have mixed
emotions about what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't remember World War II and they don't remember what
happened to the Jews. I was told that in Albania, during World War
II, no Jewish family was turned over to the Germans. Albania
protected the Jews. That's why they feel so close to Albania.''

 &HT;    Florida woman almost caught in student protests in China
 &HT;    By Jan Sjostromm
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Tanya Brooks expected her spur-of-the-moment
trip to China to be a memorable experience.
</P>
<P>
   She never thought she would end up on the fringe of the biggest
protest to shake Beijing since the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy
demonstrations 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks was shopping in a Beijing market across the street from
the United States embassy Saturday (May 8) when she saw busloads of
students pull up to the embassy. Brooks was alone. She had walked
to the market from her hotel, a few blocks away from the embassy.
She did not realize that anything was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market was boarding up quickly,'' said Brooks, who
returned to Palm Beach early Monday morning. ``They didn't speak
English, so there was no one who could tell me why they were doing
it. If I had known, I would have been nervous. I was strolling
casually.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks did not find out about the protest until after she
returned to her hotel and switched on Cable News Network. ``I was
horrified,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 27 people in Brooks' tour group was harmed by
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of rock-throwing protesters converged on the U.S.
embassy, pinning the American ambassador and other officials inside
the building, after NATO planes bombed the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia Saturday. NATO officials say the bombing was
accidental. Demonstrations continued Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators also attacked the British and Albanian embassies
Sunday and held protests in other Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
   The United States State Department issued a warning Sunday
urging Americans to defer travel to China. American citizens in the
country ``should remain in or close to their homes or hotels,'' the
advisory said.
</P>
<P>
   The warning referred to ``ongoing large-scale demonstrations,
incidents of harassment of private Americans and damage to U.S.
businesses'' in China.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Rudensky, a spokeswoman for State Department's Bureau of
Consular Affairs, said there have been no reports of injuries to
American tourists in China, although isolated incidents of
harassment have been reported.
</P>
<P>
   Rudensky advised travelers to check for updates from the
American embassy before leaving for China.
</P>
<P>
   Information is available at the state department's Web site at
www.state.gov or by calling 202-647-5225.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks had planned to go to the Chinese opera Saturday night.
She intended to go alone, because no one else in her group wanted
to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a driver there to take me,'' she said. ``The tour
leader said `I don't recommend you go but it's your choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks and the other members of her tour group did not leave
their hotel on their last night in China. ``I wasn't as worried
about my own safety as I was about the possibility that I could
start a serious incident for the American government if something
happened to me,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said she had enjoyed her seven days in Beijing until the
demonstrations broke out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fabulous,'' she said. ``I was going to go home raving
about how wonderful it was.'' When Brooks awoke Sunday morning, she
found a notice from the United States embassy that had been slipped
under her door. The notice advised travelers to use caution, but it
did tell them to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   Later that same day, Brooks boarded the bus for the airport.
``Getting to the airport was a mess,'' she said. ``It was a mob
scene.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane was delayed for an hour past its scheduled departure
time, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Kerr, director of marketing for Pacific Delight Tours, the
company that handled Brooks' trip, said such delays are common in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traffic in Beijing is very heavy,'' Kerr said. Major
flights out of Beijing like the one Brooks took are often delayed
to accommodate connecting flights, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based Pacific Delight Tours, the largest American
tour operator to China, has not canceled any of its tours to China.
</P>
<P>
   As for Brooks, she advises against traveling to China any time
soon. ``It was so dangerous, and there was no protection,'' she
said.

   Can you get the blood out of someone while it is still blue? Do
cats and dogs get sick from second-hand smoke?
</P>
<P>
   These are typical questions from children in two schools in
rural Vermont who were part of a Dartmouth Medical School study
that looked at e-mail communication between children and doctors in
training. The study also examined how children responded to
computer-mediated communication.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty medical students and pediatric residents exchanged more
than 1,400 messages with the children in kindergarten through 12th
grade over a period of two years. The researchers monitored and
analyzed the content of the exchanges in order to establish what
issues were important to children and how well both the young
people and doctors communicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This e-mail interaction was good for the doctors and good for
the students,'' said Amy Bernhardt, director of Health Quest
Initiative, a Dartmouth health education project and the lead
author of the study. ``Kids are often with parents when they go to
the doctor's office and their parents do the talking for them. What
we learned is that children have a lot of questions about their own
health. This set-up enables them to ask their questions for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges focused on avoiding tobacco, with most addressing
the health effects of smoking, its social implications and tips on
how to quit. The children also asked about personal health
concerns, among them a request for suggestions about weight-loss
exercises from an 8-year-old girl, Ms. Bernhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arnold Ronning, a pediatric resident and one of the
participants, confirmed the value of the program. ``Many kids get
information in locker rooms and television, and what they're
hearing might not necessarily be accurate,'' he said. ``If kids can
address their health-care questions to their doctors on e-mail as
they occur to them, they may be likely to address issues they
wouldn't address in front of a parent who might be in the doctor's
office with them.''

   Double Duty for a Lifesaving Move
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, a doctor named Victor Esch was on a beach when he saw a
lifeguard pull an unconscious man from the water. The guard tried
to resuscitate the man, but was unsuccessful and declared him dead.
</P>
<P>
   Esch stepped in and asked if he could try something else. The
lifeguard said yes, and Esch performed the Heimlich maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   With each upward thrust into the man's abdomen, water gushed out
of his mouth, and in moments, the ``dead'' man recovered. A chest
X-ray later showed that his lungs had been filled with water.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at the 25th anniversary of the introduction of the
maneuver, its inventor, Dr. Henry Heimlich, worries that the public
knows the Heimlich only to prevent death from choking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety to 93 percent of drowning victims have water in their
lungs,'' he said. ``And the water must be gotten out immediately.''
Besides getting the water out, the Heimlich jump-starts breathing
by pushing up on the diaphragm.
</P>
<P>
   While 200,000 lifeguards are trained each year to use the
Heimlich to save drowning victims, more than 1,000 children die of
drowning every year, mostly in private homes where no lifeguard is
present. They drown in pools, buckets of water and bathtubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can learn the maneuver in one minute,'' Heimlich said.
``If they know it, they will react at home and save these
children.''

   Maids, Bellhops and Now, a Psychologist
</P>
<P>
   For the anxious, stressed out traveler, the Nob Hill Lambourne,
a hotel in San Francisco that caters to business travelers, offers
an unusual way to decompress: The front desk will arrange for a
session with the hotel's psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel, owned by Joie de Vivre Hospitality, started the
service in February 1998. Though only a few guests have taken
advantage of it, the Hotel Acqua, also owned by Joie de Vivre, is
scheduled to open in Mill Valley, Calif., in August, and will offer
therapy sessions as well. Dr. Charmian Anderson, the Lambourne's
in-house psychologist who has a private practice in Mill Valley,
said she pitched the idea to the hotel's parent company thinking
``business people are getting used to services that are speedier
and speedier. Why not `quick' therapy?''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anderson says that most sessions take place over the phone,
though she occasionally meets with clients at the hotel. The fee is
$2 a minute, 20 percent of which goes to the hotel. The hotel
offers pamphlets in each room that describe the service.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anderson said most guests arranged for sessions because they
were worried about business concerns, and many called back for
further consultation. She said she recently talked to a chief
executive who had two weeks to raise several million dollars for
his company, and needed a sounding board for his strategy. Once the
man returned home, he arranged for a second phone session.
</P>
<P>
   Another guest was disappointed after a series of job interviews.
She called Dr. Anderson to vent and plan her next career move, but
eventually brought up the unhealthy relationship she was in.
``People start out discussing business, but it often segues into
personal matters,'' Dr. Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that the effectiveness of this type of therapy
depends on the guests' concerns: ``Travelers have unique pressures
because they don't have the safety nets of home,'' said Dr. Joseph
Kobos, director of the counseling service at the University of
Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio. ``Short-term therapy
can be useful for those issues, but you can't help rearrange a
whole life in one session.''

<P>
   PHOENIX - Before ``Star Wars,'' there were spaceships hanging
from strings in ``Plan 9 From Outer Space.''
</P>
<P>
   When our heroes battled extraterrestrial invaders in ``The
Thing,'' the monster turned out to be nothing more threatening than
Marshal Dillon (James Arness) in a carrot suit.
</P>
<P>
   Before ``Star Wars,'' science fiction was sci-fi as far as
Hollywood was concerned; B-movie throwaways for the underside of a
Saturday matinee double bill for kids.
</P>
<P>
   Movies such as ``The Blob,'' ``The Fly'' and ``Neutron vs. the
Maniac.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars'' changed all that. It blasted science fiction into
the front ranks of Hollywood spectaculars.
</P>
<P>
   George Lucas proved you don't need a Cecil B. DeMille cast of
thousands to produce movie spectacle. All you need is a
behind-the-camera crew of special-effects experts manipulating
expensive computers to generate illusions.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Star Wars'' opened, Hollywood didn't expect it to be a
big hit. The studio released it into relatively few theaters. Fans
soon corrected the misjudgment, however, and Hollywood responded.
If the business understands one thing, it's imitation.
</P>
<P>
   Film producers learned their ``Star Wars'' lessons well: Spend
your time and money on the special effects. Use computers to detail
the images you project on the screen. Create visions of exotic
worlds and fanciful creatures. Give audiences heroes to cheer,
villains to jeer. Always play to the big moments. Never forget your
catch phrases. If you want to advance a mystical philosophy, make
it kid-simple.
</P>
<P>
   And so we got ``Alien'' and ``Terminator'' and ``Independence
Day.'' There were ``Total Recall,'' ``Blade Runner,'' ``The
Abyss,'' ``E.T.'' and remakes of ``The Fly'' and ``The Thing,''
using shape-changing technologies that blew early sci-fi movies
into the dust bin of parody.
</P>
<P>
   But for all Lucas did to change the popular perception of the
genre, he didn't create modern science fiction. Before Lucas, there
were the books, the rich literature of what devotees called SF.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to the student of science fiction, there are
virtually no good films that are good science fiction,'' professor
James Gunn of the University of Kansas was quoted in the book
``Anatomy of Wonder.'' ``The problem with the science fiction film
is that it adds nothing to science fiction except concretene ss of
image _ and this may be more of a drawback than an asset.''
</P>
<P>
   What's the professor getting at?
</P>
<P>
   All the odd-looking creatures and exotic battle gear of Lucas'
galaxy are wallpaper for a kid's playroom. SF is challenging and
disturbing. ``Star Wars'' is cute and clever.
</P>
<P>
   SF books expand the realm of the imagination. Movies such as
``Star Wars'' contract the imagination by reducing limitless
speculations of alternative realities to a costume melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   Movie SF is not far from where literary SF started 70 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Early science fiction books concentrated on Flash Gordon space
operas, the sword and sorcery fantasies of Robert Howard (Conan''),
and the incredible adventures of H.G. Wells (The Invisible Man) and
Jules Verne (20,000 Leagues Under the Sea'') _ all of which by
today's standards aren't so incredible.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the first wave of experimenters, who opened the
universe of SF for exploration:
</P>
<P>
   _Isaac Asimov, with his ``Foundation Trilogy,'' depicted the
forces and counterforces that shaped a galactic civilization over a
thousand years.
</P>
<P>
   _Robert Heinlien used SF as political allegory, with ``Starship
Troopers'' mimicking the war between communism and militarism, and
``Stranger in a Strange Land'' heralding New Age mysticism.
</P>
<P>
   _Science-based Arthur C. Clarke analyzed the future of
technological civilizations from anthropological and religious
slants. &QL; 
GROWING UP  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These writers and others opened the gates, and bursting through
came new SF authors, including Frederik Pohl, Robert Silverberg,
William Tenn and Harlan Ellison.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '60s and '70s, science fiction literature grew up.
New writers were attracted to the genre. They advanced themes from
monsters into manifold manifestations of stretched, and often
warped, mentality. They wrote about exploration of the universe,
planet colonization, time travel, what-if variations on terrestrial
history, alternative intelligence, extraterrestrial religions, the
distant future and the far past.
</P>
<P>
   This new generation of SF writers used all the psychological and
artistic strategies of mainstream fiction writers without the
limitations of realistic fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Slow to react, critics continued to dismiss SF as kids' stuff.
Readers knew better. They weren't dismissing the new writers. They
were reading them, taking trips through vast realms of the
unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   SF offered new views on politics, racism, the ecology,
sexuality, mysticism, technology, the future. It broke the barriers
of thought that often constrain mainstream fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Women authors, such as Anne McCaffrey and Ursula K. Le Guin,
started writing feminist SF, offering the one thing SF fans were
most open to: new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   As computers took over more aspects of our lives, William Gibson
and other wired novelists wrote about the realms of artificial
intelligence for the digitally adept.
</P>
<P>
   Then just as the literature of SF was gaining mainstream
acceptance, ``Star Wars'' came along and redefined SF as a toy of
pop culture. After ``Star Wars,'' SF no longer meant books; it
meant kids' movies with great special effects.
</P>
<P>
   Fans, including people who had never read an SF book, came to
see ``Star Wars'' multiple times. That was great news for SF. It
was also bad news. Just as the literature was growing up, the
movies took it back down to Saturday matinee level _ just better
Saturday matinees. ``Star Wars'' was a B-movie made with A-money
technology. &QL; 
INTO THE NURSERY  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As John Brosnan wrote in his book, ``The Primal Screen,'' ``With
one bound Lucas had taken SF cinema out of the hands of adults and
into the nursery, where it has tended to remain ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars'' explored no new territory (except in the visual
effects sense). Many other SF stories had already mapped the vistas
that ``Star Wars'' was to claim for its own.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the ``Star Wars'' look comes from the illustrations of
SF magazines. Many of its ideas about empires and space travel can
be traced to other writers. The Force is a loosely digested mix of
New Age mysticism and fairy tale myths.
</P>
<P>
   But so what? It's just a movie, and nothing digests other
people's ideas like Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bob Shaw's ``Night Walk'' (1967) and James Blish's
``Bridge'' (1952) were among the many early SF books that involved
interstellar travel. Themes of galactic conquest, empire and revolt
were explored in Jerry Pournelle's ``A Spaceship for the King''
(1971) and Jack Vance's ``The Five Gold Bands'' (1950).
</P>
<P>
   Mystical ideas such as the Force of the Jedi Knights can be
found in books like Roger Zelazny's ``Lord of Light'' (1967) and
Frank Herbert's ``Dune'' (1963).
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in ``Star Wars'' is new. But its old ideas are put
together on the screen in dazzling fashion. Lucas didn't get there
first, but he did get there with the most. Whatever claims SF
writers have to the gold of imagination, George Lucas owns the
bank. ``Star Wars'' gave SF its biggest shot of popularity, driving
masses to the pedantic fandom of TV's ``Star Trek'' and ``The
X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   Because ``Star Wars'' is basically a kids' movie, many people
think it's nothing but mindless entertainment, deserving no further
analysis. That never stops the analysts, who can find significance
in anything.
</P>
<P>
   Most obviously, ``Star Wars'' extends our obsessions with the
inevitable triumph of machines over human abilities. All the humans
and humanlike aliens in ``Star Wars'' are dwarfed by the machines
they battle, particularly the Death Star.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Darth Vader so threatening is his mechanical
qualities. He is a man with no face, transformed into a
half-machine exultant to be less, or more, than human. The
laugh-reflex robots, R2D2 and C3PO, are Lucas' comic way of
diminishing the threat of the machines for kids in his audience.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have also read religious allegories into the saga: Yoda
as a Buddha figure; Luke as Christ being tempted by the devil of
the dark force in the wilderness, the Satanic Darth Vader; or Luke
as Adam forced out of the garden of Eden by the lure of forbidden
knowledge.  &QL; 
LUKE'S SWORD  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Per Schelde, linguistic anthropologist. He analyzes
``Star Wars'' in his book ``Androids, Humanoids and Other Science
Fiction Monsters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's virtually impossible to imagine the hero (Luke) without
his laser sword,'' Schelde writes.
</P>
<P>
   Most fans and kids who have played Jedi knight would agree
happily with that estimate. Then, the anthropologist lowers the
boom.
</P>
<P>
   Schelde analyzes Skywalker and his lightsaber and other
weapon-draped superheroes, this way: ``The protagonists do not have
personalities in the traditional sense. They have weapons. Put
bluntly, guns are penis-extensions.''
</P>
<P>
   Schelde pictures Luke before he learns to use his laser sword as
a teenager ``waiting for life to begin. Before (he) can become
fully adult (Luke and other science fiction heroes) have to learn
to be men, to control their penises; Luke has to learn to master
his laser sword.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever fun or insights can be had analyzing the hidden
meanings of ``Star Wars,'' Hollywood analyzed it in a different
way: The vast fortune it brought in came from the special effects,
not from the story.
</P>
<P>
   By Hollywood reasoning, SF means SFX. The plot is of little
importance, as long as the movie's special effects are spectacular
and the big moments bring the kids back through the box office
again.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the literature of SF continues to
challenge our minds by exploring alternate worlds, dimensions and
mental capacities that completely transcend anything attempted on
film.
</P>
<P>
   It's waiting out there for you whenever you're through seeing
the movie. All you have to do is open a book.  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dame Cicely Saunders is considered by many to be the world's
foremost expert in the care of the dying. In 1967, she opened St.
Christopher's Hospice in London, the first research and teaching
hospice. Her vision of a place where people could die with dignity,
surrounded by family and treated by specialists in end-of-life
care, spread around the world and helped spawn a new medical
discipline, palliative care. Dr. Saunders, now 80, still goes to
work every day and lives around the corner from the hospice that
she founded. She was in New York recently to deliver a lecture at
Mount Sinai Medical Center. In an interview, she spoke about her
life and her philosophy of death.
</P>
<P>
   Q. For the last 50 years you've been involved in caring for the
dying. Tell me about your life before that.
</P>
<P>
   A. I had a fairly easy upbringing, with money at home and
boarding school, and I went up to Oxford University in 1938 to read
philosophy, politics and economics. When the war came, that didn't
seem to be the right thing to be doing, so I left university and
went to train as a nurse. For the first time in my life, I thought
I was really in the right place.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How did you come up with the idea for hospice?
</P>
<P>
   A. I went back to university for a year, which enabled me to
qualify as a medical social worker. I got into St. Thomas' Hospital
in 1947 and there, in the first ward I took over, I met a Polish
Jew from Warsaw, who got out before the Resistance. He was 40, and
had inoperable cancer, and because he had no family, I knew he had
run into trouble. And so I kept in touch with him, and when he
collapsed and was admitted to another hospital, I followed him
there and was virtually his only visitor for the two months that he
was dying. We talked together about somewhere that would be more
suitable for him than the very busy surgical ward where he was. We
wanted a place not just for better symptom control, but for trying
to find out, in a way, who he was.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So your vision was to build a place for the dying. How did
you begin making plans?
</P>
<P>
   A. I went to one of the few early homes for the dying in London
as a volunteer nurse in the evenings, once or twice a week. It was
there that I saw the regular giving of oral morphine to prevent
pain, rather than waiting for patients to have pain first, so that
they would have to earn their morphine. This was so impressively
better than anything I had seen.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You became a doctor. Why?
</P>
<P>
   A. I was working for a very interesting thoracic surgeon, and I
said to him, ``I really have got to go back and nurse somehow. I've
got to get to people who are dying.'' And he then said, ``Go read
medicine. It's the doctors who desert the dying. And there is so
much more to be learned about pain, and you will only be frustrated
if you don't do it properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. How old were you then?
</P>
<P>
   A. I was 33.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Were you thinking about hospice during your training?
</P>
<P>
   A. By this time, I was determined to do some research in pain. I
got entrance to St. Joseph's Hospice, which was run by the Sisters
of Charity in the East End of London. When I turned up and said,
``I've got a research fellowship to look at the management of
terminal pain,'' the reverend mother replied, ``Well, I haven't any
money, but I have patients in need of a doctor.'' They were giving
drugs on demand, like everybody else was, or an hour before
visitors came. I was given these poor patients, and I simply took
the drugs that they were already taking and put them onto a regular
schedule. That was like waving a wand over the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What did you learn from those early patients?
</P>
<P>
   A. I said to a patient, a lady called Mrs. Hinson, ``tell me
about your pain,'' and without any more prompting, she just said,
``Well, doctor, it began in my back but now it seems that all of me
is wrong.'' She described her symptoms, and then said, ``I could
have cried for the pills and the injections, but I knew that I
mustn't. Nobody seemed to understand how I felt, and it seemed as
if the world was against me, and my husband and son were marvelous
but they were having to stay off work and lose their money, and
it's wonderful to just feel safe again.'' So she has described what
I started talking about as total pain.
</P>
<P>
   Q. We're having a debate in this country over assisted suicide.
What do you think?
</P>
<P>
   A. What I have learned over all these years, especially of what
people can do at the end of their lives if they have good care,
makes me very wary of a quick way out. I think it denigrates people
into just being an incurable illness, and I think it is socially,
really very dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What about Kevorkian?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I think it's bizarre, isn't it? What he has been doing
is not looking at the whole patient. He's a pathologist. He's not a
skillful physician who can offer alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What can people accomplish as they are dying?
</P>
<P>
   A. Reconciliation in families. A search for your own important
values. A setting of real priorities. My husband, who died in his
90s, sat back at the end of his life and said, ``I'm completely
happy. I have done what I had to in my life, and now I am ready to
die.'' That's a very fortunate position. But some people may look
back at a life that they think is one of failure. Still, it is
possible to meet them at that point and say to them, ``You matter
because you are you.'' You could give a person that sort of
recognition, so that they could come to the end of their life
saying, ``Well, I'm me. And it's all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. We talk about a good death. What is it?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think with a sense of fulfillment and a readiness to let
go. As far as my husband was concerned, it was a belief, as Monty
Python said, ``And now for something completely different.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have you thought about how you want to die?
</P>
<P>
   A. Everybody else says they want to die suddenly, but I say I'd
like to die of cancer, because it gives me time to say I'm sorry,
and thank you, and goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are you well?
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm very arthritic. I've got a hiatus hernia. I'm waiting to
have my next knee done. Considering all that's the matter with me,
I'm fine.

THIS CULTURE DOES NOT HAVE AN `OFF' SWITCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH LAFAVE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - (begin ital) ``If you don't like what you see on
television, you can turn it off.'' (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   We've all heard this in one form or another. ``If you don't like
(insert anything), you can turn it off.'' If you don't like certain
language, or violence, or innuendo, you don't have to view it.
</P>
<P>
   What's true for the rectangular luminescences in our living
rooms is a microcosm of the bigger scene. If you dislike certain
trends in music or movies or lifestyle or belief patterns, you
don't have to engage them. You have a free choice to accept
anything, or reject anything. Such is the blessing of a free
society.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of things, this is obviously true. Yes, I can turn
off a television. I can even throw one out. I can also live as I
wish (more or less), practice my beliefs as I desire (within
limits) and accept or reject any ideas, trends, entertainments or
artistic endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   But _ and this is the thing usually forgotten _ (begin ital) I
cannot choose to live in a culture that is free of the elements I
reject. (end ital) I cannot choose the field of choices from which
I select what I deem right, beautiful, appropriate. And it is
precisely this field of choices that sets the context for my
personal decisions. Inevitably it limits them. Unless I live as a
hermit, I must deal with elements I might prefer to reject
outright. I have no choice. Neither do you.
</P>
<P>
   You can't turn off the Big TV _ the culture at large, with its
specific do's and don'ts. A culture is no more than this: a field
of choices, of lifestyle choices, belief choices, arts and
entertainment choices. These choices can be narrow, they can be
wide. But they are never unlimited. They cannot be. Choice is
always contextual, always somehow limited.
</P>
<P>
   A pizza delivery man once roared up to my house with rap music
going full-blast that including the f-word. I could not choose to
have him not blare it. I might ask him to turn it off or even
complain to the store owner, but I was powerless to control the
exposure at that moment.
</P>
<P>
   I would prefer to live in a culture free of that sort of easy
pseudo-sophistication, that smug atmosphere in which the mere
employment of a simple curse word is taken as a symbol of freedom
and hipness. However, short of moving to a remote place in, say,
Alaska, I cannot make that choice, anymore than someone living in
the 1950s could have chosen to live in a culture that encouraged
the license to which I object. Everybody is stuck with the culture
at hand, and with the field of choices it offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turn off the television'' is particularly insulting when
applied to parents, as it often is, usually by non-parents. In our
house, the grown-ups battled for a long time to keep the young ones
from saying ``butt.'' That wasn't a word we found appropriate;
``behind'' was encouraged in its place. You can disagree with the
choice, but it was our choice, and that is the point: our choice
didn't matter. ``Butt'' is in all the television shows and movies,
and even if our kids didn't see those shows and movies, they have
dozens of friends at two schools, and ``butt'' _ whether we like it
or not _ is generally acceptable among them. It sneaked in through
peer groups, along with a couple other choice words that were never
heard in our house, either on TV or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Even flipping the channels is a dangerous business. Unless it is
done swiftly, and preferably with the mute button on, a parent can
easily find himself having to explain oral sex, adultery, abortion
and child molestation _ and that's just from a chance encounter
with the nightly news. &QL; 
SOLUTIONS TO TV
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps eliminating television entirely is an option, although
it would take enormous effort, energy and ingenuity to come up with
ample replacements in society as now constructed. It would also be
necessary to turn off a few kids at school whose parents don't turn
off the TV. Showing only select videotapes is a possibility,
although it would mean staying up at night pre-screening everything
for content. (As guides, ratings are a big joke.)
</P>
<P>
   For a while, the most horrific elements can be kept at bay. The
kids don't have to see Jerry Springer. But even that will
eventually become a losing battle. As children grow into teens,
some among their peers will happen to see Springer and his ilk _ no
parent can monitor a teenager 24 hours a day _ and these few will
report to the others about the woman who took 300 lovers in 24
hours or the man who slept with his wife's entire family. The
culture cannot be turned off.
</P>
<P>
   But it can be changed. Cultures are always changing, in little
ways and big. People have their effect on the big picture. Voices
can be raised in objection to explicitly sexual television content.
Protests can be lodged against violence-laden song lyrics. Critical
eyes and ears can be turned to dislodging bad art posing as free
expression.
</P>
<P>
   It becomes necessary to add a disclaimer: I am not advocating
government censorship. We have become accustomed to thinking that,
because a person dislikes X, he then thinks it should be against
the law. There are plenty of legal things I dislike, but I do not
wish them legislated against. There are also many illegal things I
dislike that I would like to see legalized. It is the role of
culture, not government, to determine the choices we have. It is
culture that must be influenced. &QL; 
 &QL; 
POLITICS OF HYPOCRISY
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I can already hear somebody mumbling about ``cultural
censorship.'' To protest any expression of any kind is to engage in
de facto censorship, some people say.
</P>
<P>
   This is hypocrisy in full swing, for there is always cultural
censorship. Always. Any culture allows some forms of expression and
restricts and punishes others. Try, for example, to tell certain
jokes. Tell a joke offensive to anyone but rednecks and
Republicans, and you could be out of a job. Write a script that
glorifies smoking or presents politically incorrect content and it
won't get produced. There is acceptable expression and unacceptable
expression in baby boomer America just as there is acceptable and
unacceptable expression in every conceivable society. That's
cultural censorship. Wherever there are people, it will exist. The
only thing that changes is what is acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't like what's currently acceptable, if you object to
the cultural context you're stuck with, you have the right to
attempt to change it through art, through protest, through
educational reform. ``Turning off the television'' is not only not
enough, it simply isn't possible. &QL;

TALE OF TRIUMPH ON EVERY ASPIRIN BOTTLE

   In 1951, pediatricians in Sydney, Australia, were puzzled by the
death of a 10-month-old boy. The child had been screaming and
vomiting for 30 hours, and doctors believed that he had a systemic
infection or meningitis. But it was neither.
</P>
<P>
   Peering into a standard microscope at tissues from the boy's
autopsy, Dr. Ralph Douglas Kenneth Reye found no evidence of
infection. Instead, he noticed distinct liver and brain damage of a
type that he had never seen. Over the next 11 years at the Royal
Alexandra Hospital for Children, Reye identified 20 more cases of
what his colleagues nicknamed Reye's syndrome. The doctors
suspected the damage had resulted from a toxin they could not
identify.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, Reye (pronounced like rye) described the cases in The
Lancet. Although the report came from the same hospital where in
1942 Dr. Norman Gregg first recognized the damage that rubella
virus infection in a pregnant woman could have on her fetus, Reye's
syndrome drew little attention. Still, these reports started a
chain of events that led to one of the century's major public
health triumphs, while leaving the man the syndrome was named for
nearly obscure.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades passed before American epidemiologists linked Reye's
syndrome and the use of aspirin to control fevers among children
with viral infections, particularly influenza and chickenpox.
</P>
<P>
   Then aspirin manufacturers and the government fought
acrimoniously over the Food and Drug Administration's efforts to
issue warning labels on aspirin containers. The drug industry
attacked the aspirin studies as methodologically unsound. But news
reports led to a sharp drop in both the use of aspirin among
children and the incidence of Reye's syndrome in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The 555 cases in 1980 represent the largest number recorded in
this country in any year, though that number is believed to be a
fraction of those that did occur. Even though it was uncommon,
Reye's syndrome became a household word. Parents feared their
children might develop the relentless vomiting, fever, convulsions,
delirium, screaming, intense irritability and violent movements
that characterize the syndrome. The symptoms begin from one to 14
days after an illness like flu or chickenpox. If the syndrome is
not recognized and treated in time, coma and death come quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention have reported that Reye's syndrome has virtually
disappeared from the United States. Seven or fewer cases were
reported each year from 1994 through 1998. When cases occur now,
doctors are urged to look for a genetic disorder known as an inborn
error of metabolism.
</P>
<P>
   Direct proof that aspirin causes Reye's syndrome is still
lacking; the evidence is based on the statistical association
between the declining use of aspirin in children and the incidence
of the syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Attaching a doctor's name to a disease or syndrome is one of
medicine's highest accolades, and it often thrusts the doctor into
the limelight. But not Reye, the father of pediatric pathology in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues interviewed described Reye as a tall, stately,
reserved man who spoke slowly, never wasted words, was courteous to
everyone and did meticulous work. He sat at a large desk in a large
paneled office with the door closed. Although that reserve was
intimidating to some younger doctors, when a physician entered to
discuss a case, Reye would devote full attention and would soon
turn to a nearby microscope to point out the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Leslie Hardacre is credited with first naming the syndrome.
He said he wrote it in a patient's chart in 1959 as a joke.
Hardacre recalled Reye as ``a pretty aloof guy who you could not
get very close to.''
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Patricia M. Bale, a pathologist who worked with Reye,
remembers him as very social in a small group, but shunning
parties, travel and scientific meetings, even when invited as an
honoree. He drove a polished Jaguar and spent hours discussing the
relative merits of car engines.
</P>
<P>
   Reye spent his entire career at the Royal Alexandra Hospital,
where he also first described the pathology of a type of tumor in
infants that some doctors, in a play on the medical term for tumors
called Reyeomas. But he was not of the publish-or-perish mentality,
writing only 32 papers.
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   Although Reye's syndrome bears one name, it took many scientists
elsewhere to make it a public health success story. It also took
two colleagues, Dr. Graeme Morgan and Dr. Jim Baral, to push Reye
to publish his findings about the syndrome. Baral said that when he
began training at the hospital in 1961, one of his first patients
was admitted with the diagnosis of Reye's syndrome. Baral had never
heard of it. So he consulted textbooks and journals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't find any reference because it had not been
reported,'' said Baral, now a dermatologist in New York City. ``Dr.
Reye sat on this for 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Baral then began discussing the syndrome with Reye. Soon, Reye
invited Baral to spend a year training with him in pathology. The
hospital's chief resident, Morgan, became interested in the
syndrome and also spent a year working with Reye. Both young
doctors prevailed on Reye to publish the cases.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan went to Reye, saying, ``Listen, it's about time we
reported this, and I am willing to help.'' Reye agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Graeme and I dug up the charts on all the cases, and we spent
a year reviewing every item in them,'' Baral said.
</P>
<P>
   The health department joined in, interviewing the involved
families and performing toxicology tests. They found that 11 of the
21 children had taken aspirin. ``When a kid had a fever, we used to
give aspirin as the first line of defense,'' Baral said. He said
the information on aspirin was not included in The Lancet paper
because little thought was given to it as the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   Although most doctors call the disease Reye's syndrome, American
doctors often call it Reye-Johnson syndrome. The reason is that
shortly after Reye's report, another group led by Dr. George M.
Johnson, now at the University of North Dakota in Fargo, reported
the deaths of 16 school-age children in North Carolina from the
same type of liver and brain damage. They linked it to an influenza
B viral infection.

 UNDATED: viral infection.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reports of new conditions often bring responses from others who
claim they discovered it earlier. No less a figure than Britain's
leading neurologist, Dr. W. Russell Brain, claimed that the
Australian findings were the same his team had made in 1929. But
Reye retorted that there was more difference than similarity in the
reports.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan said that when he worked in Los Angeles in 1967, many
American colleagues ``dismissed our report as having no
significance.'' But, he said, ``To anyone who knew how meticulous
Douglas was, the suggestion that he was making a fuss about nothing
would have been ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan went on to specialize in pediatric genetics and Baral
moved to Babies Hospital in New York City, where he searched the
records for cases of Reye's syndrome since 1929 and found none.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Reye nor Johnson teams pursued further
investigations into the syndrome, but a small number of other
scientists did. In the early 1970s, health officials became
concerned about the increasing number of Reye's syndrome cases
being reported, and in 1976, the CDC began national surveillance
for Reye's syndrome. The emerging pattern was puzzling, because the
incidence varied from region to region within the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Then about 1980, studies in Arizona, Michigan and Ohio linked
aspirin use in children with viral infections to the syndrome.
Despite the scientific findings, medical leaders were at first
extremely skeptical about them. By then aspirin had been used
extensively for half a century and was considered a safe drug. How
could it be causing a previously unknown hazard? The answer lay in
epidemiologic studies, but the drug industry attacked the
methodology as flawed.
</P>
<P>
   A battle developed over the government's efforts to have
manufacturers put warning labels on aspirin bottles and to remove
aspirin as an ingredient in most products intended for children.
After a delay, warnings were required in 1986 and remain, saying:
``Children and teen-agers who have or are recovering from
chickenpox, flu symptoms or flu, should NOT use this product. If
nausea, vomiting or fever occur, consult a doctor because these
symptoms could be an early sign of Reye's syndrome, a rare but
serious illness.''
</P>
<P>
   In calling attention to the disappearance of Reye's syndrome in
the current New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Arnold S. Monto of
the University of Michigan School of Public Health said puzzles
remained. Japanese doctors have reported Reye's syndrome during
outbreaks of influenza among children who did not receive aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he believed that Reye's syndrome was due to
mutations in the influenza and chickenpox viruses and that aspirin
played only a minor role. In Australia, the incidence of the
syndrome has sharply declined, Morgan said, but he is not convinced
the link is proven.
</P>
<P>
   Reye died suddenly and unexpectedly in 1977, a day after his
mandatory retirement at 65. The man whose obituary in The Medical
Journal of Australia was less than two lines now has his name
prominently mentioned on every bottle of aspirin.

GOODBYE, STARR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Go away, Ken Starr.
</P>
<P>
   At last, you are finished. Kaput. You are morally, politically,
psychologically and legally bankrupt. The country wants to be rid
of you.
</P>
<P>
   If you had any sense, you would resign right away. But then you
don't have much sense, do you?
</P>
<P>
   We are fed up with your vindictiveness, your lack of judgment,
your partisan prejudices, your self-righteous rampage. You have
ruined not only your own reputation but the once-revered concept
that an outside independent counsel would be more honest than the
Justice Department in probing charges of wrongdoing in the
executive branch.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness, in the end you were simply incompetent. You
couldn't hook the Big Fish in the White House and you couldn't send
the smallest fish of all to jail, either.
</P>
<P>
   You spent more than $40 million of taxpayers' money to get 12
guilty pleas from relatively unimportant officials, three
convictions in Arkansas, three partial acquittals and two
mistrials. Except for former Associate Attorney General Webster
Hubbell's tax evasion conviction and the endless aggravation and
legal fees imposed on people close to the White House, you were no
match for Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   You got House Republicans to impeach Clinton with your
overheated report elevating his personal misbehavior into high
crimes. But you couldn't get the Senate to convict him. He's
battered but still standing.
</P>
<P>
   You flaunted your partisan bias. You kept mum about the fact
White House aide Vincent Foster was a suicide long after you
reached that conclusion and well after the 1996 election, allowing
conservative conspiracy nuts to indulge in wild speculation about a
murder orchestrated by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   You have not found grounds to indict either the president or
first lady on Whitewater or any other supposed financial misdoings,
yet you have refused to clear them.
</P>
<P>
   After Susan McDougal served her 18-month civil jail sentence for
refusing to cooperate with your grand jury probe of Clinton's
financial activities, you demanded she go to jail again for
criminal contempt and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   A wise Arkansas jury said phooey, this is too much, acquitted
her on obstruction and deadlocked on other contempt counts.
</P>
<P>
   You had great legal power and you abused it _ and your arrogant
trampling of witnesses' civil rights was a far more dangerous
threat to our democratic system than the sins of a flawed president
lying about a pitiful affair with a silly intern.
</P>
<P>
   It is fitting that you got your fatal comeuppance last week in a
Virginia courtroom where you sent six prosecutors _ count `em, six
_ to persuade what you thought would be a friendly, conservative,
anti-Clinton jury to ruin a woman who frustrated you.
</P>
<P>
   The mistrial of your absurd obstruction of justice suit against
Julie Hiatt Steele was a ``so what?'' case that ended correctly,
with the charges neither proven nor unproven. No rational
prosecutor would have brought such a minor case.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Willey, who had claimed that President Clinton groped
her, said she promptly told Steele about it; Steele disagreed,
saying Willey didn't make the claim until years later. There was no
conclusive evidence to convince the jury, or Starr, which one was
lying.
</P>
<P>
   Starr chose to believe Willey because her unquestioned testimony
could have added another count to his impeachment charges against
Clinton, who denied her accusations. But Steele's contradictory
version undercut Willey and bolstered Clinton's denial.
</P>
<P>
   When Willey admitted under defense questioning to prior lies
about other sexual adventures, she seemed far less credible than
she had in a ``60 Minutes'' interview recounting Clinton's supposed
assault.
</P>
<P>
   Juror interviews afterward indicated that some didn't much care
for her. Steele's lawyers cleverly left it at that, keeping their
client off the stand and free of potentially embarrassing questions
about her own life.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the whole episode was centered on a minor event
that did or did not happen. This is not of the magnitude of
presidential wrongdoing and corruption that the taxpayers thought
Starr had been hired to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   Steele was the only person in the Monica Lewinsky saga who Starr
legally threatened with up to 20 years in prison. He gave Monica
herself immunity for cooperating with him and not only once but
twice he gave immunity to Willey, who had also initially lied to
prosecutors. Starr's office kept Willey's immunity secret until
legally forced to reveal it to Steele's defense lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in a CNN interview why the women, all of whom had
credibility problems, were treated so differently, former Starr
prosecutor Robert Bittman indicated that a crucial difference was
whether they cooperated with Starr and company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people come to Jesus,'' Bittman said, adding that Steele
had been given the opportunity to ``come to the truth'' (as seen by
the prosecutors) but had not done so.
</P>
<P>
   Her crime, like McDougal's, is basically that she did not fry
Clinton for Starr, as he wanted her to.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's vengeful approach to McDougal and Steele was so
transparent that both women were able to use it effectively as a
partial courtroom defense. Yet he's no sadder or wiser.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of immediately bowing to reality, his office said he
would think awhile about whether to re-try them. He may legally do
a rerun in both cases. But he won't if he still has some shred of
sanity left.
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye, Ken Starr. It's been bad to know you.

WAKE UP TO A NEW MORNING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JAY HANDELMAN   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   And you thought the late-night TV talk show war between Jay Leno
and David Letterman was fascinating. Take a look at the morning.
</P>
<P>
   The network battle is beginning to bubble like an old-fashioned
percolator. In what may be one of the last great TV battlegrounds,
with the potential for real audience growth, ABC and CBS finally
are taking aim at NBC's ``Today,'' the perennial ratings leader.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, CBS surprised no one when it announced that Bryant
Gumbel, who had struck out with his prime-time news magazine,
``Public Eye,'' will become host of a revamped ``CBS This Morning''
in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   It was a logical choice because Gumbel was the king of morning
television during most of his 15 years at the helm of ``Today,''
which he left two years ago to join CBS. He was expected to become
a prime-time magnet for viewers because of his live interview
skills. He has a reported $5 million-a-year contract, but he hasn't
been seen since ``Public Eye'' was canceled earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   In January, ABC called out its own big guns to give a new boost
to its failing ``Good Morning, America.'' Diane Sawyer and Charles
Gibson, both busy on the prime-time ``20/20,'' were brought in to
bring some short-term consistency to the show that hadn't worked
well since Joan Lunden left and Gibson was replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer and Gibson have helped raise the ratings and profile for
the former No. 1 morning show, and network observers say their
``temporary'' status may turn out to be a longer-term pairing.
</P>
<P>
   Both ABC and CBS also are building new studios to give their
viewers the same kind of ``window on the world'' that they get on
the ``Today'' show. A studio with a view of New York City streets
reportedly was one of Gumbel's conditions for agreeing to return to
the morning beat on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   CBS still has to name a new co-anchor for Gumbel, and ABC may
still be searching for permanent hosts for GMA.
</P>
<P>
   But will any of it matter? ``Today'' continues to just glide
over the competition primarily because of the family atmosphere it
has created with co-hosts Katie Couric and Matt Lauer, news reader
Ann Curry, and jovial weatherman Al Roker.
</P>
<P>
   When they're together, everything seems to flow smoothly, and
even the occasional forays into the crowd gathered outside the
studio near Rockefeller Center seem genuine rather than forced.
</P>
<P>
   That's the real challenge facing ABC and CBS: To find hosts who
can gel and provide the kind of tone that will help viewers wake up
and get ready for work or school each day.
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel will bring some sort of following to the CBS show, which
likely will get a new name. But how will he get along with the
anchor hired to join him? Don't expect to see Deborah Norville's
name among the possibilities after their short-lived pairing on
``Today'' when she replaced Jane Pauley.
</P>
<P>
   During the announcement last week, Gumbel dismissed any notion
that he failed in prime time and that his new assignment is
something of a comedown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view it like somebody who was a Broadway star and then went
and did a movie. And the movie wasn't a big box-office smash and so
they decide to go back to Broadway. Does that make them a bomb? I
don't think so,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel has formidable skills. He is a strong interviewer, who
will ask tough questions without appearing offensive, and who takes
the news seriously. But it will take more than interviews to turn
the CBS morning show into something more than the also-ran it has
been for years.

STUDIOS HAVE THEIR WORK CUT OUT THIS SUMMER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``This technological terror is insignificant
compared to the power of the Force.'' _ Darth Vader in ``Star
Wars'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; That 22-year-old line may turn out to be disturbingly accurate
for Hollywood. As the frenzy over ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The
Phantom Menace'' builds toward the May 19 opening at 12:01 a.m.,
studio executives are losing sleep over how they can sweet-talk
moviegoers into settling for something besides George Lucas' tale
of how Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader.
</P>
<P>
   Here's Hollywood's problem: Cary Tobaben, a Los Angeles-based
writer and clerk in his early 40s, normally would see half a dozen
movies during the summer. That's going to change markedly in the
next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be spending my movie dollars to see `Phantom Menace'
over and over,'' Tobaben said recently. ``If I see it more than six
times, then I probably need to question my social priorities, but
six is quite acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Is he interested in any other movie? ``Maybe `The Matrix' or
`Austin Powers II,' but with the price of tickets and gasoline, I
have to be careful,'' Tobaben said. ``My gut feeling is that since
I will probably cut back, I may have to settle for seeing `Phantom
Menace' only five times and that'll be it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's already clear the summer of '99 will be unlike any other.
At this time a year ago, the betting was ``Godzilla,''
``Armageddon'' and ``X-Files'' would be the top-grossing movies of
the summer; they turned out to be ``Saving Private Ryan,''
``Armageddon'' and ``Something About Mary,'' with combined U.S.
grosses of $590 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phantom Menace'' probably will top that number by itself, and
could go far past ``Titanic's'' $600.7 million record. As a result,
the classic summer ``popcorn'' movie _ big stars, big special
effects, massive budget _ is gone this year with two exceptions:
``Phantom Menace'' and Warner Bros.' ``Wild Wild West,'' starring
Will Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the key word for studios is ``counterprogramming.''
Lucas and Fox have decreed that only the biggest and best-equipped
U.S. auditoriums, only 4,000 in all, can play ``Phantom Menace.''
That leaves 30,000 other screens to fill from late May through
August.
</P>
<P>
   So, rather than trying to offer films that are everything to
everyone, studios have selected films that reliably can deliver a
niche audience. The best example: two Julia Roberts romantic
comedies _ Universal's ``Notting Hill'' with co-star Hugh Grant and
Paramount's ``Runaway Bride'' _ that will open within nine weeks of
each other.
</P>
<P>
   The summer also will see a trio from the ever-dependable horror
genre: Sony's ``13th Floor,'' DreamWorks' ``The Haunting'' and
Sony's ``Deep Blue Sea.'' And in a completely predictable move,
Disney has staked out its usual slots in mid-June and late July for
two promising family features: ``Tarzan'' and ``Inspector Gadget.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited because we have a very good, somewhat eclectic
schedule,'' said Robert Friedman, vice chairman of Paramount's
motion picture group. ``I am concerned about `Star Wars,' but we're
comfortable that our movies are different enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Paramount, which finished a close second to Disney last year for
the box-office title despite releasing fewer than a dozen movies,
has four summer entries: the John Travolta thriller ``The General's
Daughter''; ``South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut''; Roberts'
``Runaway Bride''; and ``The Wood,'' a coming-of-age story set in
Inglewood.
</P>
<P>
   But much of how well everything performs comes back to ``Phantom
Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A rising tide lifts all boats,'' said Kevin Skislock, an
entertainment consultant with Laguna Research Partners. ``You want
the flagship movie to work out so the fleet can have fair sailing.
This is going to be one of the greatest summers since 1977, when
`Star Wars' created a very good feeling about going to the movies,
and you had `Saturday Night Fever' and `Close Encounters of the
Third Kind' do great business.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there any chance that ``Phantom Menace'' won't deliver?
Observers say no way.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gut feeling is that the word `huge' doesn't even describe
how `Phantom Menace' is going to do,'' said Drew Devlin, an
executive with Clark Film Buying in Bozeman, Mont. ```Titanic'
caught everyone by surprise, but this is a movie that people have
been waiting for since `Return of the Jedi' in 1983.''
</P>
<P>
   Devlin pointed out that 1997's re-release of ``Star Wars''
topped $140 million domestically after the original grossed $322
million. ``The reissue primed the pump and whetted everyone's
appetite,'' he said. ```Phantom Menace' will play throughout the
summer, and it will be a great film, based on what we've seen from
the trailers.''
</P>

   Much of this summer's profit goes to Lucas, since he financed
the $120 million movie, while Fox merely receives a 10 percent
distribution fee. Lucas has issued one of the most conservative
performance estimates at $400 million in domestic ticket sales.
Robert Bucksbaum, whose Reel Source service advises theater chains
on box-office prospects for upcoming films, believes it will take
in $475 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of the few who don't think it will beat `Titanic,'
which had the perfect time frame,'' Bucksbaum explained.
```Titanic' had the advantage of opening when it was very
competitive for the first few weeks, then it had the Academy Awards
buzz, and then it won. It appealed to every single market; the only
people who didn't go more than once were males over 45.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's why Bucksbaum believes ``Titanic'' will keep the record:
female moviegoers generally and older women specifically may have
limited interest in ``Phantom Menace''; additionally, films playing
during the past three Memorial Day weekends (``Godzilla,'' ``The
Lost World: Jurassic Park'' and ``Mission: Impossible'') all saw
huge drops in business during the following weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me wrong _ $475 million is huge, but we think $600
million is too much to ask,'' Bucksbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   So, here's the bottom line for summer: There's ``Phantom
Menace'' and then there's everything else. Last summer, nine movies
reached $100 million domestically; that number could be as few as
half a dozen this summer. Three of those _ ``Wild Wild West,'' New
Line's ``Austin Powers II'' and Disney's ``Tarzan'' _ have outside
shots at $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The early favorite as this summer's No. 2 is ``Wild Wild
West,'' based on Smith's string of hits _ ``Independence Day,''
``Men in Black'' and ``Enemy of the State'' _ and eye-popping
special effects. It doesn't hurt that the movie, based on the '60s
television show, has the prime July 2 release date. But there have
been rumors that the budget on the film has ballooned and new
scenes have been shot recently.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry executives think No. 2 will go to ``Austin Powers
II,'' thanks to the great buzz from its masterful trailer spoofing
``Star Wars.'' And in recent months, ``Tarzan'' has picked up a lot
of buzz after Disney took the unusual step of screening the film,
even though some parts were not yet completed, to an appreciative
crowd of theater owners at the ShoWest convention in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt sharing `Tarzan' with the exhibitors at that point
would set it up as a blockbuster,'' said Disney distribution
executive Chuck Viane. ``And I think doing that has put it into a
special category.''
</P>
<P>
   Other projects with $100 million potential:
</P>
<P>
   _ Paramount's ``Runaway Bride,'' with Roberts and Richard Gere.
``People remember the chemistry from `Pretty Woman,''' said
Bucksbaum. ``It's the prototypical date-crowd movie.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Sony's ``Big Daddy,'' starring Adam Sandler, which opens June
25. Sandler's last two films grossed $240 million combined.
</P>
<P>
   _ Universal's high school sex comedy ``American Pie,'' which
Bucksbaum sees as a ``Porky's for the '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Warner Bros.' much-anticipated ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' starring
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in director Stanley Kubrick's last
movie before he died.
</P>
<P>
   _ Universal's ``The Mummy,'' opening Friday. The trailer, highly
reminiscent of the ``Indiana Jones'' films, has gotten strong
response.
</P>
<P>
   _ Paramount's ``The General's Daughter,'' due June 11, with
Travolta as a military investigator. ``It's a lot like `Patriot
Games,' '' said Paramount's Friedman. ``We think this will appeal
to all audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though each carries an indefinable ``buzz'' of being a
potential hit, some will likely fall far short. At this time last
year, Universal's ``BASEketball'' was touted as the summer's
sleeper, but it bombed with a $7 million gross. The real sleeper
hit was ``There's Something About Mary,'' the 40th-highest domestic
grosser ever at $176.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Several longshots have emerged for this summer. Most carry
limited expectations, however, since they will have to post
exceptional grosses early in order to hang around for more than a
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Theater owners, who have dug deep into their pockets to add
5,000 screens during the past four years, are dropping
disappointing performers more quickly than ever in favor of new
product.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't count any summer film out because not everyone is a
`Star Wars' fan,'' Devlin said. ``The good thing is that the summer
is starting early with films like `Entrapment' and `The Mummy.'
Studios are stretching out the schedule, which is what exhibitors
want, rather than putting the big guns up against each other.''
</P>
<P>
   If the studios can stretch the summer box office beyond the
traditional Memorial Day-to-Labor Day peak, theaters no doubt will
be extremely pleased. After all, those 16 weeks generated records
of $2.58 billion and 550 million tickets sold last summer. Even if
``Phantom Menace'' vaporizes ``Titanic's'' record and grosses $800
million, that's still going to be only a third of the total box
office.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Fay, president of AMC Film Marketing, said strong
momentum in recent weeks by ``The Matrix,'' ``Life'' and
``Entrapment'' is an excellent precursor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the audiences coming back,'' he said, ``and I think
we'll have a record-breaking summer. `Star Wars' is going get
people back in the habit of seeing movies and talking about them.''

SUPERSTRINGS AND THE NEANDERTHAL PHILHARMONIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Mich.)   (af)  
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The discovery of animal bones with holes drilled at regular
intervals has encouraged paleoanthropologists to believe that
Neanderthals were playing music on crude flutes 43,000 years ago.
True or not, musical instruments have an ancient lineage firmly
based on physics and mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   In the 5th century B.C., both Pythagoras of Samos (the one who
discovered the theorem about right triangles) and Chinese
bronzesmiths who cast musical bells hit upon systematic scales of
notes defined by mathematical relationships. Music seems almost as
old as human history.
</P>
<P>
   But connections between music and science are subtle and
uncertain, and all too often we are asked to accept on faith the
supposed links between the concert hall and the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   A seemingly endless debate persists between those who regard
music as a branch of physics and those who see it as the artistic
product of inspired but inexplicable minds. The latest attempt to
bridge the chasm between these divergent perspectives was offered
in New York last week at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum by the
Emerson String Quartet and a Columbia University physics professor,
Dr. Brian Greene, whose words-and-music performance was not exactly
a recital and not exactly a lecture; it was something like what
people in the 1960s called a ``happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The five black-clad performers sought to demonstrate an
underlying kinship between some seminal ideas of physics and music;
Greene's depiction of Newton's clockwork universe, for instance,
was followed by two elegantly structured Bach fugues. A simplified
introduction to the modern theory of superstrings preceded some
hard-to-get-to 12-tone works by Anton Webern and Alban Berg.
</P>
<P>
   Superstring theory is an attempt to bring into consonance two
bodies of thought central to modern physics: relativity, which
helps to explain cosmic-scale interactions, and quantum mechanics,
which describes the domain of the ultra-small.
</P>
<P>
   Both theories are wonderfully successful within their own
domains, but have yet to be united as a single coherent description
of the universe _ unless, perhaps, the superstrings theory turns
out to be correct.
</P>
<P>
   That theory (or rather, the five versions of it grouped together
as components of a larger theory) depend on mathematical
correspondences between 10 different dimensions of reality _ as
mind-boggling an idea as any in science. It is easy enough to
envision a three-dimensional cube, but when even one more spatial
dimension is added, as in a four-dimensional tesseract or
``hypercube,'' visualization becomes impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the acceptance of a 10-dimensional description of reality
requires an act of faith in the mathematics involved. Many
physicists would like to become believers, if only because
superstrings would solve many problems, including the mystery of
how gravity is related to the other forces of nature.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps an analogous act of faith is required to fully accept
the atonal and 12-tone music of Arnold Schoenberg and his
followers, some of which was played at the Guggenheim event.
</P>
<P>
   But acts of faith in both music and mathematics are hard for
ordinary people to swallow. A much more accessible connection
between music and science lies in the fact that music and science
often seem to cohabit creative minds. Among the thinkers who
noticed this was Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz, who invented
calculus independently of Newton. He wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Music is the hidden mathematical endeavor of a soul
unconscious it is calculating.''
</P>
<P>
   A conspicuous example of the admixture of science and music was
Alexander Borodin, a distinguished Russian chemist and physician,
who in his spare time wrote the opera ``Prince Igor,'' three
symphonies and some other immortal orchestral and chamber works.
</P>
<P>
   He is less well known for having pioneered a field of
carbon-fluorine chemistry that ultimately led to nonstick cookware
and freon refrigerants; unknowingly, the composer helped to found a
branch of chemistry that has unfortunately led to depletion of the
global ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If there is a connection between Borodin's wild sonorities and
his sober chemistry, it is obscure.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John F. Putz, a mathematician at Alma College in Michigan,
thought he perceived mathematical influences in the music of
Mozart. Some of his evidence came from a search of Mozart piano
music for a mathematical proportion called the ``golden ratio'' _ a
number known to mathematicians, architects and others since ancient
times.
</P>
<P>
   The golden ratio, which defines many patterns in nature
(including the spiral patterns at the centers of daisies) can be
calculated by dividing up a straight line into two unequal
segments. If this is done in such a way that the ratio of the whole
line to its larger segment is the same as the ratio of the larger
segment to the smaller segment, the resulting ratio works out to
about 1.61803 to 1: a value known as the ``golden ratio.''
</P>
<P>
   In an article in Mathematics Magazine, Putz wrote that the
golden ratio defines proportions in architecture that many people
find pleasing, so he looked for this ratio in paired sections of a
Mozart sonata. Each of the three movements of Mozart's Sonata No. 1
in C major was divided by the composer into two parts, with a short
``exposition'' at the beginning followed by a longer
``recapitulation and development.''
</P>
<P>
   Putz found a very close agreement with the golden ratio in the
lengths of the two sections of each of the first two movements of
the sonata, but not in the third movement. ``We must remember that
these sonatas are the work of a genius,'' Putz wrote, ``and one who
loved to play with numbers. Mozart may have known of the golden
ratio and used it.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added an acknowledgment that it was probably Mozart's
inspired mind and not any mathematical calculation that produced
the music.
</P>
<P>
   Many have applied mathematical relationships to musical
composition. Among the most influential of the mathematical
composers was Joseph Schillinger, whose system of composition found
its way into movie sound tracks, synthesizer music and many other
musical forms. Schillinger's most famous student was George
Gershwin, and even Albert Einstein thought highly of Schillinger's
system.
</P>
<P>
   Some physicists, like Dr. Richard F. Voss of IBM, have asserted
that music has a strong ``fractal'' element; that is, it contains
rhythmic and melodic structures that sound the same at all size
scales. (Fractal geometry, which supposedly describes the
``self-similarity'' of mountain ranges or shore lines as viewed
from any distance, is a part of chaos theory.)
</P>
<P>
   But the question of whether music and physics can be illuminated
in terms of each other remains open. It is entertaining to hear the
views of physicists about the ultimate realities of existence. It
is also entertaining to listen to great music. But it remains to be
proved that these two fields of creative endeavor are causally
linked.
</P>
<P>
   In his essay ``The Joy of Music,'' the composer Leonard
Bernstein wrote: ``We bumble. We imitate scientific method in our
attempts to explain magic phenomena by fact, forces, mass, energy
...
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way one can really say anything about music is to
write music.''

   LOS ANGELES _ It's a period of civil war. Rebel movies are
plotting against the ``Star Wars'' empire. Tarzan, Julia Roberts,
the Muppets, Inspector Gadget and the kids from ``South Park''
gather at a secret location to hatch ad campaigns
</P>
<P>
   ``We're counter programming. We're counter programming,'' each
of them cries as they try to divine weaknesses in Lucas' Death
Star.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, ``South Park's'' Cartman squeals, ``Why don't we get
the ... out of the way, man.'' The room falls silent. They realize
it's a brilliant strategy, but from such an unexpected source.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Muppets' Kermit speaks up, ``Well, I'll have to ask
Miss Piggy, first.'' But even she agrees, and everybody _ except
for a few brave or stupid souls _ hightails it to June, July and
August.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there are movies other than ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The
Phantom Menace'' coming out this summer. More than 120 of them, and
quite a few look like they're worth going to.
</P>
<P>
   So peruse our Summer Film Preview, wandering from ``The Wild
Wild West'' to ``Notting Hill'' with your ``Eyes Wide Shut.'' Hang
out with ``Big Daddy'' or ``Austin Powers,'' ``The General's
Daughter'' or ``The Runaway Bride. Or chill out with ``The
Haunting,'' ``Deep Blue Sea'' or ``Lake Placid.''

SCI-FI, BEFORE AND AFTER GEORGE LUCAS  
 (ADV: WITH STARHISTORY-MOVIES) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Early sci-fi meant B-movies, Saturday matinees such as
``It Came From Outer Space,'' ``Plan 9 From Outer Space,'' ``Attack
of the 50-Foot Woman,'' ``Cat Women of the Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Star Wars'' wasn't the first great science fiction movie.
Here are 10 winners that brought worlds of SF to the screen before
Wookiees were a gleam in George Lucas' eye:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' (1968): A spectacular foray into
adult science fiction, as director Stanley Kubrick turns an Arthur
C. Clarke story into a sobering examination of space exploration
and man's relations with the technology he creates but cannot
master.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' (1956): Science fiction as
allegory, with this creepy tale of plant invaders that turn humans
into mindless, conformist pod people who apparently are still with
us. Brilliantly remade by director Phillip Kaufman in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   3. ``Night of the Living Dead'' (1968): You have to watch this
horror movie about an uprising of the dead all alone at 3 a.m. with
the back door unlocked. Then see how long you can leave it
unlocked. The sequel, ``Dawn of the Dead,'' is more ironic and
comic but still a strong follow-up that will change the way you
look at shopping malls forever.
</P>
<P>
   4. ``Village of the Damned'' (1960): Creepy tale of an English
village where all the women, impregnated by an alien force, give
birth to platinum blonde babies whose eyes glow and whose minds are
otherworldly. Remade with less impact and success in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   5. ``A Clockwork Orange'' (1971): Stanley Kubrick at his best
again, directing Anthony Burgess' novel about violent misfits of a
futuristic society into a premonition of today's outbreaks of urban
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   6. ``Barbarella'' (1968): A young, highly aerobic Jane Fonda
plays an intergalactic sex kitten in this funny, visually
imaginative version of a French comic strip.
</P>
<P>
   7. ``The Day the Earth Stood Still'' (1951): Best of the early
B's, this extraterrestrial encounter actually has a message, as an
alien arrives on Earth with a warning.
</P>
<P>
   8. ``The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.'' (1953): Imaginative musical
fantasy for kids and parents about a boy trapped in the bizarre
world of a piano dictator. Dr. Seuss wrote the script, so you know
it's packed with off-beat treats.
</P>
<P>
   9. ``Planet of the Apes'' (1968): Our sense of the order of
things is turned inside out when a spaceship crashes on a planet
run by intelligent apes. Followed by sequels of varying quality.
</P>
<P>
   10. ``A Boy and His Dog'' (1975): A young Don Johnson stars in
this adaptation of the Harlan Ellison story about a boy trying to
survive a post-apocalyptic world with the aid of his psychic dog. &QL; 
AFTER `STAR WARS' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The post-``Star Wars'' era is filled with great SF movies. We'll
assume you've seen the big hits that came out since ``Star Wars''
was released in 1977: ``Terminator'' and ``T2,'' ``Alien'' and
``Aliens'' (``Alien 3'' and ``4'' optional), ``Total Recall,''
``Blade Runner,'' ``The Abyss`` (the studio's cut, not the
director's), ``E.T.,'' ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,'' ``Back to the
Future'' (``Part 2'' and ``3'' questionable), ``Twelve Monkeys,''
``The Fly'' (David Cronenberg's 1986 version, not the 1958
original).
</P>
<P>
   We hope you lucked out of seeing some of the big-budget bombs
that didn't learn the ``Star Wars'' lessons: ``Dune,'' ``Sphere,''
``Event Horizon.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are five imaginative works of science fiction that you
might have missed over the past 22 years:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``The Brother From Another Plane''t: John Sayles typically
makes clever dramas about real people caught in real-life
situations, films such as ``Lone Star'' and ``Return of the
Secaucus Seven.'' But Sayles doing science fiction?
</P>
<P>
   His tale of a mute, Black-skinned alien who crash-lands in
Harlem and comes to terms with our planet's possibly unique brand
of racism demonstrates how flexible science fiction is and what
clever use a smart director can make of camera tricks without a big
budget.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``Earth Girls Are Easy'': SF comedy about alien men who come
to our planet looking for dates and find two Valley girls (Geena
Davis and Julie Brown), who take them out of this world again.
</P>
<P>
   Science fiction doesn't often get funny, but it does here.
</P>
<P>
   3. ``The Incredible Shrinking Woman'': Cult satire starring Lily
Tomlin as the woman who shrinks in her kitchen. The film's art
design took SF in a new direction, finding fantasy without ever
leaving home.
</P>
<P>
   4. ``The Man Who Fell to Earth'': Eerie tale of a corporate
executive (played by rocker David Bowie), who is actually an alien
on an earthly mission.
</P>
<P>
   5. ``It Came From Hollywood'': Hilarious collection that samples
the worst of early sci-fi movies, with funny commentary from a
variety of comedy stars. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Go away, Ken Starr.
</P>
<P>
   At last, you are finished. Kaput. You are morally, politically,
psychologically and legally bankrupt. The country wants to be rid
of you.
</P>
<P>
   If you had any sense, you would resign right away. But then you
don't have much sense, do you?
</P>
<P>
   We are fed up with your vindictiveness, your lack of judgment,
your partisan prejudices, your self-righteous rampage. You have
ruined not only your own reputation but the once-revered concept
that an outside independent counsel would be more honest than the
Justice Department in probing charges of wrongdoing in the
executive branch.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness, in the end you were simply incompetent. You
couldn't hook the Big Fish in the White House and you couldn't send
the smallest fish of all to jail, either.
</P>
<P>
   You spent more than $40 million of taxpayers' money to get 12
guilty pleas from relatively unimportant officials, three
convictions in Arkansas, three partial acquittals and two
mistrials. Except for former Associate Attorney General Webster
Hubbell's tax evasion conviction and the endless aggravation and
legal fees imposed on people close to the White House, you were no
match for Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   You got House Republicans to impeach Clinton with your
overheated report elevating his personal misbehavior into high
crimes. But you couldn't get the Senate to convict him. He's
battered but still standing.
</P>
<P>
   You flaunted your partisan bias. You kept mum about the fact
White House aide Vincent Foster was a suicide long after you
reached that conclusion and well after the 1996 election, allowing
conservative conspiracy nuts to indulge in wild speculation about a
murder orchestrated by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   You have not found grounds to indict either the president or
first lady on Whitewater or any other supposed financial misdoings,
yet you have refused to clear them.
</P>
<P>
   After Susan McDougal served her 18-month civil jail sentence for
refusing to cooperate with your grand jury probe of Clinton's
financial activities, you demanded she go to jail again for
criminal contempt and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   A wise Arkansas jury said phooey, this is too much, acquitted
her on obstruction and deadlocked on other contempt counts.
</P>
<P>
   You had great legal power and you abused it _ and your arrogant
trampling of witnesses' civil rights was a far more dangerous
threat to our democratic system than the sins of a flawed president
lying about a pitiful affair with a silly intern.
</P>
<P>
   It is fitting that you got your fatal comeuppance last week in a
Virginia courtroom where you sent six prosecutors _ count `em, six
_ to persuade what you thought would be a friendly, conservative,
anti-Clinton jury to ruin a woman who frustrated you.
</P>
<P>
   The mistrial of your absurd obstruction of justice suit against
Julie Hiatt Steele was a ``so what?'' case that ended correctly,
with the charges neither proven nor unproven. No rational
prosecutor would have brought such a minor case.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Willey, who had claimed that President Clinton groped
her, said she promptly told Steele about it; Steele disagreed,
saying Willey didn't make the claim until years later. There was no
conclusive evidence to convince the jury, or Starr, which one was
lying.
</P>
<P>
   Starr chose to believe Willey because her unquestioned testimony
could have added another count to his impeachment charges against
Clinton, who denied her accusations. But Steele's contradictory
version undercut Willey and bolstered Clinton's denial.
</P>
<P>
   When Willey admitted under defense questioning to prior lies
about other sexual adventures, she seemed far less credible than
she had in a ``60 Minutes'' interview recounting Clinton's supposed
assault.
</P>
<P>
   Juror interviews afterward indicated that some didn't much care
for her. Steele's lawyers cleverly left it at that, keeping their
client off the stand and free of potentially embarrassing questions
about her own life.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the whole episode was centered on a minor event
that did or did not happen. This is not of the magnitude of
presidential wrongdoing and corruption that the taxpayers thought
Starr had been hired to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   Steele was the only person in the Monica Lewinsky saga who Starr
legally threatened with up to 20 years in prison. He gave Monica
herself immunity for cooperating with him and not only once but
twice he gave immunity to Willey, who had also initially lied to
prosecutors. Starr's office kept Willey's immunity secret until
legally forced to reveal it to Steele's defense lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in a CNN interview why the women, all of whom had
credibility problems, were treated so differently, former Starr
prosecutor Robert Bittman indicated that a crucial difference was
whether they cooperated with Starr and company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people come to Jesus,'' Bittman said, adding that Steele
had been given the opportunity to ``come to the truth'' (as seen by
the prosecutors) but had not done so.
</P>
<P>
   Her crime, like McDougal's, is basically that she did not fry
Clinton for Starr, as he wanted her to.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's vengeful approach to McDougal and Steele was so
transparent that both women were able to use it effectively as a
partial courtroom defense. Yet he's no sadder or wiser.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of immediately bowing to reality, his office said he
would think awhile about whether to re-try them. He may legally do
a rerun in both cases. But he won't if he still has some shred of
sanity left.
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye, Ken Starr. It's been bad to know you.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When a classic convergence of tornado-producing forces shaped up
in southern Oklahoma on May 3, funnel-chasing scientists from the
university town of Norman scrambled like jet pilots, heading for
flatbed trucks carrying advanced radar that, they hope, will
eventually help find the key to a tantalizing, frustrating mystery:
How is a tornado born?
</P>
<P>
   The answer lies in the last few minutes of a complex chain of
events that begins when large-scale air masses clash and ends when
a twister rakes the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the process leading up to the critical moment of tornado
genesis is well understood. But unless and until research
meteorologists can solve the puzzle of the last crucial step, they
will be at a loss to predict whether a garden variety tornado is on
the way, or one so puny it will fall apart at the first obstacle it
hits, or a monster like one that struck the outskirts of Oklahoma
City on May 3, demolishing entire neighborhoods and killing dozens
of people.
</P>
<P>
   That tornado appears to have been one of the most powerful ever
observed. Its whirling winds were measured by meteorologists from
the University of Oklahoma at 318 miles an hour, which they believe
to be a record wind speed. More important, they were able to
approach to within about three-quarters of a mile of the big
tornado's center; there, with debris raining down around them, they
believe they captured the twister's birth on radar.
</P>
<P>
   The data will not be fully analyzed for some time, and much more
will be necessary before researchers can draw general conclusions
about tornado birth, life and death. Every tornado is a little
different, and they are all capricious, evanescent and hard to get
a fix on. But in time, the scientists believe, forecasters will be
able to predict not just that a tornado is coming, as they
presently can, but also how strong it will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any skill at that now,'' said Dr. Joshua Wurman,
one of the Oklahoma researchers.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the difficulty of trying to pin down the atmospheric
machinations that give birth to a tornado has proved ``just
excruciating,'' said Dr. Roger Wakimoto, a tornado expert who heads
the atmospheric sciences department at the University of California
at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Tornadoes are the product of thunderstorms that blossom when
cold, dry air masses meet warm, moist ones. This takes place along
the jet stream, the high-altitude, west-to-east river of air that
marks the boundary between cold polar air and warm tropical air.
When these air masses meet, warm, moist air near the ground rises,
and, when it meets colder air aloft, the moisture condenses into
rain.
</P>
<P>
   The falling rain drags down air with it, producing powerful
downdrafts. Sometimes, warm, dry air intrudes between the cold air
aloft and the warm, moist air near the ground. As the moist air
near the ground rises, it carries the drier air with it. The drier
air cools faster than the moist air and makes the situation even
more unstable, producing especially violent thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring in Tornado Alley, a swatch of the Great Plains
stretching across Kansas, Oklahoma and northern Texas, those
conditions are often met: The jet stream converges with warm, moist
air from the Gulf of Mexico and warm, dry air from the Mexican
plateau. In fact, ``those three ingredients come together more
frequently in Tornado Alley than anywhere else in the world,'' said
Fred Gadomski, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University.
More tornadoes develop there than anywhere else on the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The May 3 tornado developed from a variety of thunderstorm
called a supercell, which in turn was produced by just the kind of
convergence of elements described by Gadomski. A supercell is a
big, hulking storm distinguished by the internal presence of a
twisting, tilted updraft whose tilt enables it to avoid getting
tangled up with the storm's downdrafts. This updraft is therefore
more stable and long-lived, enabling the storm itself to live as
long as there is a supply of surface moisture. Supercells can
produce several tornadoes and are the main generator of the most
powerful and long-lasting ones.
</P>
<P>
   But the appearance of thunderstorms only sets the stage for
tornadoes, and only a few storms produce them. Certain conditions
within the storm must be met for a tornado to form. The most
important is wind shear _ cross-cutting winds of differing speeds
or directions. When two layers of wind move in the same direction
at different speeds, the effect is to set air between them
rotating, as when one twirls a pencil between one's palms.
</P>
<P>
   This horizontal roll of rotating air is pushed upward in the
center by the powerful updraft of warm, moist air feeding the
thunderstorm at its base. Eventually, the roll evolves into a
relatively slow-whirling vertical vortex called a mesocyclone. The
vortex then narrows and lengthens; this increases its speed, just
as a skater's whirl intensifies when she pulls her arms in close or
extends them over her head.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery is how that last step happens. It is at this
critical juncture, apparently, that tornadoes somehow become
stronger or weaker. Only a very few reach the status of F4 or F5 on
the Fujita scale of tornado damage _ tornadoes with winds of more
than 206 miles an hour. (F0 and F1, on the other end of the scale,
have winds of 40 to 112 miles an hour; an F3 storm's winds are 158
to 206 miles an hour.)
</P>
<P>
   The chances that an F4 or F5 tornado ``will go over any
individual spot in a person's lifetime is on the order of 1 in 10
million, even in Tornado Alley,'' Gadomski said.
</P>
<P>
   The most destructive and lethal of the Oklahoma tornadoes on May
3 was an F5; such a storm destroys nearly everything in its path.
The May 3 twister was also long-lived, staying on the ground about
four hours. The known record is seven hours; most last only a few
minutes at best.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The big challenge facing researchers is to learn to tell the
difference in tornadoes as far in advance as possible, so that more
precise and timely warnings can be issued. ``Right now,'' Wurman
said, ``we just say there's a tornado coming; we don't know whether
it's an F0 or an F5.''
</P>
<P>
   Improved predictions require better knowledge of the very
fine-scale interplay of temperature, moisture and wind that
converts a mesocyclone into a tornado. Experts like Wurman are
pursuing this knowledge using up-to-date technology to gather
real-world data, which are used to improve theoretical models that
are then expressed mathematically in the computerized models of the
atmosphere on which today's weather forecasters rely.
</P>
<P>
   One theoretical question is whether tornadoes develop from the
top of the thunderstorm down or from the ground up. This bears
importantly on the matter of how a more slowly rotating mesocyclone
increases its spin to tornadic speed. It was long assumed that the
tornado builds from the top down, but Wakimoto says there is ``a
mountain of evidence'' that many build from the ground up.
</P>
<P>
   In attempting to answer questions like this, tornado-chasing
researchers have used various technologies. One, called TOTO _ for
Totable Tornado Observatory, not Dorothy's dog from ``The Wizard of
Oz'' _ is an instrument package designed to be placed in a
tornado's path and sucked up by it. Some chasers also deploy squat
packages of sensors called turtles along roads. But tactics like
these, popularized in the movies, have limited utility, since it is
difficult to place the instrument packages properly.
</P>
<P>
   To zero in on tornado genesis, researchers concentrating on
Tornado Alley use two strategies introduced in the past five years,
said Dr. Harold Brooks, a research meteorologist at the National
Severe Storms Laboratory, a federal research installation in
Norman. In one, researchers chase thunderstorms and tornadoes in
fleets of cars and vans packed with instruments that measure things
like temperature, wind, air pressure and atmospheric moisture.
Readings are taken every six seconds in an attempt to build up a
fine-grained picture of tornado development.
</P>
<P>
   Wurman and his colleagues use the second strategy, chasing
storms and tornadoes in two flatbed trucks on which Doppler radars
are mounted. Like conventional radar, the Doppler version can
``see'' fine targets like raindrops and can tell how far away a
mesocyclone or tornado is. But it can also tell whether a tornado
is moving away from or toward the radar station.
</P>
<P>
   Stationary Doppler radar is widely used by weather forecasters.
But because the radar is often many miles away from the storm, its
beam is aimed too high. Doppler on Wheels, as the Norman program is
called, casts its beam into the storm much closer to the ground.
``It allows us to see details in the velocity structure we've never
seen,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   Doppler on Wheels also scans the atmosphere eight times faster
than the forecasters' radar, and when two Dopplers focus on the
same storm from different angles, a better picture of the storm's
structure and dynamics emerges.
</P>
<P>
   Wurman and his colleagues are on tornado standby from mid-April
to mid-June. So it was that on May 3, when the classic set of
Tornado Alley conditions materialized over southern Oklahoma, ``we
left the building fast,'' Wurman said.
</P>
<P>
   From 2 p.m. until after midnight, they chased supercell
thunderstorms and tornadoes across the state. They watched the
supercell that spawned the F5 killer that struck Oklahoma City spit
out one tornado after another. In two cases, the researchers
believe, the Dopplers captured tornadoes being formed _ including
the Oklahoma City monster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens very quickly,'' said Wurman, with rotating winds
escalating from perhaps 40 or 50 miles an hour to well over 100
miles an hour in two, three or four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's two more puzzle pieces,'' he said of the sightings of
tornado births. ``This will give us some answers.'' But a long road
lies ahead, not least in analyzing the mass of data that the
researchers are gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're reeling with the volume of data we've collected,''
Wurman said.
</P>
<P>
   How realistic is it to hope that tornado forecasts can
significantly improve? Predictions will never be perfect, it is
widely agreed. For one thing, the atmosphere has a chaotic, random
streak that frustrates precision and predictability. For another,
the short life of tornadoes inherently limits warning time; just
now it is measured in a few minutes. Some believe it might be able
to improve on that by 15 or 20 minutes. Optimists say an hour might
ultimately be possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the new technology we have,'' Wurman said, ``we are
positioned to make major strides. It really comes down to
persistence in chasing down tornadoes.''

<P>
   PHOENIX - Early sci-fi meant B-movies, Saturday matinees such as
``It Came From Outer Space,'' ``Plan 9 From Outer Space,'' ``Attack
of the 50-Foot Woman,'' ``Cat Women of the Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Star Wars'' wasn't the first great science fiction movie.
Here are 10 winners that brought worlds of SF to the screen before
Wookiees were a gleam in George Lucas' eye:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' (1968): A spectacular foray into
adult science fiction, as director Stanley Kubrick turns an Arthur
C. Clarke story into a sobering examination of space exploration
and man's relations with the technology he creates but cannot
master.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' (1956): Science fiction as
allegory, with this creepy tale of plant invaders that turn humans
into mindless, conformist pod people who apparently are still with
us. Brilliantly remade by director Phillip Kaufman in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   3. ``Night of the Living Dead'' (1968): You have to watch this
horror movie about an uprising of the dead all alone at 3 a.m. with
the back door unlocked. Then see how long you can leave it
unlocked. The sequel, ``Dawn of the Dead,'' is more ironic and
comic but still a strong follow-up that will change the way you
look at shopping malls forever.
</P>
<P>
   4. ``Village of the Damned'' (1960): Creepy tale of an English
village where all the women, impregnated by an alien force, give
birth to platinum blonde babies whose eyes glow and whose minds are
otherworldly. Remade with less impact and success in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   5. ``A Clockwork Orange'' (1971): Stanley Kubrick at his best
again, directing Anthony Burgess' novel about violent misfits of a
futuristic society into a premonition of today's outbreaks of urban
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   6. ``Barbarella'' (1968): A young, highly aerobic Jane Fonda
plays an intergalactic sex kitten in this funny, visually
imaginative version of a French comic strip.
</P>
<P>
   7. ``The Day the Earth Stood Still'' (1951): Best of the early
B's, this extraterrestrial encounter actually has a message, as an
alien arrives on Earth with a warning.
</P>
<P>
   8. ``The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.'' (1953): Imaginative musical
fantasy for kids and parents about a boy trapped in the bizarre
world of a piano dictator. Dr. Seuss wrote the script, so you know
it's packed with off-beat treats.
</P>
<P>
   9. ``Planet of the Apes'' (1968): Our sense of the order of
things is turned inside out when a spaceship crashes on a planet
run by intelligent apes. Followed by sequels of varying quality.
</P>
<P>
   10. ``A Boy and His Dog'' (1975): A young Don Johnson stars in
this adaptation of the Harlan Ellison story about a boy trying to
survive a post-apocalyptic world with the aid of his psychic dog. &QL; 
AFTER `STAR WARS' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The post-``Star Wars'' era is filled with great SF movies. We'll
assume you've seen the big hits that came out since ``Star Wars''
was released in 1977: ``Terminator'' and ``T2,'' ``Alien'' and
``Aliens'' (``Alien 3'' and ``4'' optional), ``Total Recall,''
``Blade Runner,'' ``The Abyss`` (the studio's cut, not the
director's), ``E.T.,'' ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,'' ``Back to the
Future'' (``Part 2'' and ``3'' questionable), ``Twelve Monkeys,''
``The Fly'' (David Cronenberg's 1986 version, not the 1958
original).
</P>
<P>
   We hope you lucked out of seeing some of the big-budget bombs
that didn't learn the ``Star Wars'' lessons: ``Dune,'' ``Sphere,''
``Event Horizon.''

   Here are five imaginative works of science fiction that you
might have missed over the past 22 years:

   1. ``The Brother From Another Plane''t: John Sayles typically
makes clever dramas about real people caught in real-life
situations, films such as ``Lone Star'' and ``Return of the
Secaucus Seven.'' But Sayles doing science fiction?
</P>
<P>
   His tale of a mute, Black-skinned alien who crash-lands in
Harlem and comes to terms with our planet's possibly unique brand
of racism demonstrates how flexible science fiction is and what
clever use a smart director can make of camera tricks without a big
budget.

to our planet looking for dates and find two Valley girls (Geena

Tomlin as the woman who shrinks in her kitchen. The film's art
design took SF in a new direction, finding fantasy without ever

executive (played by rocker David Bowie), who is actually an alien

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A winter storm warning was posted for the mountains of western
Montana Monday morning as a low pressure system several thousand
feet aloft, marked by a pocket of very cold air, drifted overhead.
Tuesday, as the cold low moves east-northeast, the atmosphere will
destabilize over eastern and central Wyoming, paving the way for
scattered showers and thunderstorms. Showers and storms will
migrate east over the high plains of western South Dakota and
western Nebraska later Tuesday afternoon and evening. Farther east,
scattered showers and thunderstorms will develop over the upper
Middle West over the upper Mississippi Valley and western Great
Lakes. A few will be heavy.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms will erupt from Kansas to central
Texas as moist air streaming north from the Gulf of Mexico is
lifted ahead of a cool front associated with the cold upper-level
low pressure system over the northern Rockies. The availability of
low-level moisture will be high over Texas and southern Oklahoma,
but relatively weak winds between 10,000 and 20,000 feet will limit
the risk of severe weather. Nonetheless, downpours and gusty winds
will accompany some of these storms.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms will bubble up Tuesday
afternoon across parts of the southern Appalachians and Tennessee
Valley. Isolated thunderstorms will form along the sea-breeze
fronts just inland from FloridaUs Gulf and Atlantic Coasts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, scattered showers will escort a rather modest Pacific
disturbance into western Washington and western Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Legacy of Storms
</P>
<P>
   Hours after a cluster of thunderstorms dies, the legacy of
rain-cooled air left in its wake can spark new storms. The line
between the area of rain-cooled air and warmer air to the south,
which is often a breeding site for new storms, is called an outflow
boundary. When increasingly warm, humid air from the south impinges
on this boundary, it is forced to rise over cooler air, setting the
stage for new storms to develop. Monday morning, an outflow
boundary left in the wake of a cluster of thunderstorms over Texas
sparked afternoon thunderstorms that reached severe levels in some
areas.

SCI-FI STINKERS: WHY WE LOVE 1950S' CHEESY FLICKS  
 (ADV: INCLUDES LISTS OF FILMS) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   PHOENIX - ``Star Wars,'' Star Snores.
</P>
<P>
   Can't compare with ``Devil Girl From Mars.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabid fans may be lining up for tickets when ``Star Wars:
Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace'' finally opens, but those of us who
grew up on the real thing know that if you want the bona fides, you
must find them in the mustier corners of your video store or the
back channels of your basic cable.
</P>
<P>
   For the kind of sci-fi that sticks to your frontal lobe for a
lifetime, you must look to something a lot less classy than George
Lucas' New Age Wookiee-fest.
</P>
<P>
   You're talking the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The production of that single decade is astounding. There are
hundreds of them, really cheesy space monster movies, made with the
collective budget of a middle-size Levittown, N.Y., household.
During Lent.
</P>
<P>
   Those films, from ``Rocketship X-M'' in 1950 to ``Teenagers From
Outer Space'' in 1959, outlined a genre. Even today's most
up-to-the-state-of-the-art FXtravaganza will manage to pay homage
to those cheese-athons of yore.
</P>
<P>
   You know the drill: An elderly scientist with a beautiful
daughter discovers a new planet or an underground civilization that
will destroy the world, or at least a small out-of-the-way English
coastal village. All the best World War II stock footage of tanks
and cannon cannot gun down the menace until our hero invents a new
ray or oxygen destroyer that manages to vaporize the menace or at
least cause it to doze off, meanwhile winning the daughter, whose
name, by the way, is always a transgender name like Chris or Pat.
(The hero has to be surprised at the beginning that the elderly
scientist's assistant is a ``girl.'')
</P>
<P>
   And at the end she hugs her man, who is usually dressed in a
leather flight jacket, and they stare off into the empty ocean and
she asks him if the danger is over, if the flying
saucer/interplanetary dinosaur/giant centipede will ever come back,
and he looks pensive and says: ``Keep watching the skies.''
</P>
<P>
   How can ``Star Wars'' compete with that?
</P>
<P>
   And the acting in these low-budget classics is sometimes
mind-blowing. Hollywood didn't put its Gary Coopers and Cary Grants
in cheap genre flicks. No, it drew from the shallow end of the pool
of talent that included such luminaries as William Lundigan and
Lyle Talbot. Most of them made Al Gore look as animated as Roger
Rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, let's face it: Mark Hamill may be a lousy actor, but
he's no Sonny Tufts.
</P>
<P>
   What is so surprising about those awful films is just how much
affection we feel for them when they show up on ``Mystery Science
Theater 3000'' or during a baseball rain delay.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there are two types of affection we feel for them. For
there are two different ways they stand out.
</P>
<P>
   First, there is the movie that is so bad, it is fun to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plan 9 From Outer Space'' (1958) is the archetype for this.
Director Ed Wood has often been credited with making the worst
movie ever. But this is calumny. There is something naively loopy
about ``Plan 9'' that makes us cherish its every goofy blunder.
Like when the scene shifts from day to night and back again, with
no continuity. Like when its star Bela Lugosi died and Wood
replaced him midproduction with his wife's chiropractor, a head and
a half taller than Lugosi.
</P>
<P>
   And the dialogue: ``Greetings, my friends. We are all interested
in the future, for that is where you and I are going to spend the
rest of our lives. And remember, my friends, future events such as
these will affect you in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   And: ``Explode the sunlight here, gentlemen, and you explode the
universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Audiences howl with laughter all the way through the movie.
Nobody could have made anything so cheesy on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   But Ed Wood wasn't alone. There are plenty of bad movies, with
plywood sets, paper-plate flying saucers and cardboard acting.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another sort of film that we love, too. In those, a
miserable script and lumpy acting are somehow saved by either a
director who makes more of it all than you have any right to
expect, or by an idea or image that sticks in the mind like a
dream.
</P>
<P>
   What alien is more inexpressibly other than the glass-helmeted
homunculus from ``The Man From Planet X'' (1951)? And what planet
is more memorably odd than the partly solarized, red-colored
landscape from ``Angry Red Planet'' (1959)?
</P>
<P>
   And there is a subgenre in this, in which such moviemakers as
Ivan Tors tried naively but sincerely to show what space travel or
robots would be like. ``Destination Moon'' (1950), or ``Gog''
(1954), for instance.
</P>
<P>
   The movies are not actually good, but they have good hearts.
</P>
<P>
   The '50s had its share of larger budget sci-fi, too. Some of
them are classics, such as ``The Day The Earth Stood Still''
(1951). They transcended their genre.
</P>
<P>
   Some people consider ``Forbidden Planet'' (1956) to be a minor
masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   But it is those benighted films such as ``Robot Monster''
(1953), with its man in a gorilla suit and a diving helmet, or
``The Cape Canaveral Monsters'' (1960), by the same director, with
its out-of-shape zombies dressed in spandex with fried eggs for
eyes, that truly deserve worship.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, ``Cape Canaveral Monsters'' was a swan song. With
the advent of the 1960s, science fiction took a turn and not for
the better. What had been naive attempts at entertainment in the
previous decade took on the more ominous tone of exploitation.
Producers aimed their films at the teenage market, and the gore
level rose. The monsters had faces like used chewing gum and they
oozed slime.
</P>
<P>
   And worse, it was all caught on really bad, underlit color film.
</P>
<P>
   The flatly lit black and white film of the '50s was a signature
style. You could tell instantly what you were in for. Flood lamps
illuminated the scene evenly and spread twin shadows to the right
and left of everything. But the bad lighting of the '60s couldn't
help the goo-faced monsters. There was a failure of sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   We can recognize that in retrospect, looking back through an age
that imitated the loopiness of the earlier films. But it doesn't
matter if you call your film ``Slave Girls From Beyond Infinity''
(1987), these made-for-cable cheesers are way too self-conscious.
</P>
<P>
   We can never regain our innocence. &QL;

Most of the bad science fiction and space monster movies from this
story are out on video. However, titles appear and disappear
without warning. Check your local video store.
</P>
<P>
   Many show up on cable television, especially on American Movie
Classics, the Science Fiction Channel and Turner Classic Movies.

 &QL; 
TOP 10 &QL; 
Cheesy Sci-Fi movies from the 1950s &QL; 
 &QL; 
10. ``Cat-Women of the Moon'' (1953) _ Our astronauts, led by Sonny
Tufts, reach the moon only to find a cave full of exotic dancers in
black cat suits. There is also a giant spider. Similar plots show
up in ``Missile to the Moon'' (1959) and ``Fire Maidens From Outer
Space'' (1954), but neither can top the original. &QL; 
9. ``Angry Red Planet'' (1959) _ An American space team lands on
Mars and is eaten by giant spiders with rat faces. Only the
``girl'' survives. The acting is rudimentary, but the visuals are
unforgettable, even in their cheesiness. &QL; 
8. ``The Crawling Eye'' (1958) _ Forrest Tucker acts his heart out
in this tale of giant eyeballs with tentacles that live in frozen
radioactive clouds above a Swiss village and communicate
psychically with a young woman. &QL; 
7. ``Invaders From Mars'' (1953) _ This is almost a work of genius.
Despite vestigial special effects, no movie has ever portrayed
childhood paranoia better than this. A boy suspects his parents
have been made into zombies by the buried flying saucer. No one
believes him. &QL; 
6.``Kronos'' (1957) _ A giant cube from outer space eats energy and
gets bigger. So, what does the army do? Try to kill it with an
A-bomb. ``You Earth people are stupid! Stupid! Stupid!,'' as Eros
says in ``Plan'' ``9.'' The sight of a building-size monster moving
across the landscape is eerie. &QL; 
5. ``Plan 9 From Outer Space'' (1958) _ Sometimes called ``the
worst movie ever made,'' ``Plan 9'' nevertheless has a loopy
genuineness to it, an almost soft-hearted pacifist message at its
core, as zombies raised from the dead by aliens are meant to take
over the Earth. This movie is a party waiting for you to invite
your friends to. &QL; 
4. ``Riders to the Stars'' (1954) _ One of the rare color films
from this age of black and white, ``Riders'' is a straightforward,
even humorless attempt to explain the travails of space travel,
with lots of centrifuge scenes and a love triangle. Little
excitement, but lots of sincerity. &QL; 
3. ``Gog'' (1954) _ This is Ivan Tors at his best, telling a story
about how man's development of technology can come back to harm
him. Gog and its twin, Magog, are among the best robots ever put on
film. They are not humanoid but look more like what we see in
industrial robots today. &QL; 
2. ``The Queen of Outer Space'' (1958) _ This may have been Zsa Zsa
Gabor's best role. She plays a kind of Hungarian freedom fighter
rebelling against a masked evil queen of the universe and saving
the lives of the American space men. This is actually a fourth
version of ``Cat Women of the Moon,'' but it is even campier. Its
silliness unfortunately forecasts the doom of the naive space
movie. &QL; 
1. ``The Man From Planet X'' (1951) _ Shot for less than $50,000 in
six days by low-budget genius Edgar G. Ulmer, this film manages to
make a virtue of every budget shortcut he was forced to take. The
atmospheric sets, supposedly English moors, are foggy to hide their
phoniness. But the imaginative spacecraft _ a sort of upside down
aluminum ice-cream cone _ and pathos-evoking blank-face alien are
unforgettable. So is villain William Schallert, before he became
Dobie Gillis' teacher, Mr. Pomfritt. This film is a minor classic
and shows how you can do a great deal on a shoestring and an idea.
And a scientist with a lovely daughter. &QL;

   Deep within a forest a little turtle began to climb a tree.
After hours of effort, he reached the top, jumped into the air
waving his front legs, and crashed to the ground. After recovering,
he slowly climbed the tree again, jumped, and fell to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The turtle tried again and again while a couple of birds sitting
on a branch watched his sad efforts. Finally, the female bird
turned to her mate. ``Dear,'' she chirped, ``I think it's time to
tell him he's adopted.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MUM, SEND $ &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A kid calls up his mum from his college and asks her for some
money.
</P>
<P>
   Mum says, ``Sure, sweetie. Mum will send you some money. You
also left your calculus book here when you visited two weeks ago.
Do you want me to send that up too?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Uhh, oh yeah, OK,'' responds the kid.
</P>
<P>
   So Mum wraps the book up along with the checks in a package,
kisses Dad goodbye, and goes to the post office to mail the money
and the book.
</P>
<P>
   When she gets back, Dad asks, ``Well how much did you give the
boy this time?''
</P>
<P>
   Mum says, ``Oh, I wrote two checks, one for $20, and the other
for $1000, out to him''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thats $1020!!!'' yells Dad, ``Are you crazy???''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry hun,'' Mum says, kissing Dad on the on top of his
bald head, ``I taped the $20 check to the cover of his book, but I
put the $1000 one somewhere between the pages in chapter 19!''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ALL RISE! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A minister was preoccupied with thoughts of how he was going to
ask the congregation to come up with more money than they were
expecting for repairs to the church building.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, he was annoyed to find that the regular organist was
sick and a substitute had been brought in at the last minute. The
substitute wanted to know what to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a copy of the service,'' he said impatiently. ``But
you'll have to think of something to play after I make the
announcement about the finances.''
</P>
<P>
   During the service, the minister paused and said, ``Brothers and
Sisters, we are in great difficulty; the roof repairs cost twice as
much as we expected, and we need $4,000 more. Any of you who can
pledge $100 or more, please stand up.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, the substitute organist played, ``The Star
Spangled Banner.''

 &HT;    Shareholders give go-ahead to Jameson, Signature merger
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta-based Jameson Inns said Monday its merger with
Signature Inns has been approved by shareholders of both companies.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, valued at $120 million, increases the number of rooms
for Jameson by 73 percent. It also increases the number of states
in which Jameson operates or has properties under development from
eight to 13. By the end of the year, the combined company will have
8,000 rooms in operation.
</P>
<P>
   This is Jameson's first acquisition. Previous growth has been
achieved through the building of new properties. There is no
specific plan for additional acquisitions at this time, according
to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Strategically and financially, the deal with Signature is a good
fit, said Craig R. Kitchin, president and chief financial officer
of the 11-year-old company. Neither company has franchised units.
</P>
<P>
   ``They own their own brand and so do we,'' he said. ``It's
important for us to be able to control all aspects of hotel
operations.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, holders of outstanding Signature common
stock will receive one-half share of Jameson common stock and a
cash payment of $1.22 in exchange for each share of Signature
common stock. A dividend of 28 cents per share was paid to holders
of Signature common stock.
</P>
<P>
   Kitchin said the brands will retain their separate identities,
but will be operated by Jameson.
</P>
<P>
   Jameson has 85 inns, primarily in the Southeast, including
Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and
Tennessee. The company currently has 17 new inns under development,
and will be building in Florida and Virginia this year. Signature
has 25 inns, largely in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   David Tannehill, an analyst with Morgan Keegan &AMP; Co. in Memphis,
estimates the merger will add to Jameson's earnings from operations
by 20 cents to 35 cents per share on an annualized basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good transaction for Jameson,'' Tannehill said. ``The
Signature portfolio has been a stagnant group of properties in the
Midwest, and Jameson has been more growth-oriented and expanding
their brand throughout the Southeast.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, he said, will be integrating the two operations
and growing the Signature brand, which does not have strong
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Signature has about 650 employees and Jameson 1,800. No layoffs
or closings are planned, said a Jameson spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments, Jameson recently announced it had opened
a state-of-the-art training facility adjacent to its home office in
suburban Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Jameson University will offer three programs and ongoing
training via video conferencing to all of the inns throughout the
Southeast. New managers will be required to complete the four-week
curriculum.

 &HT;    Menacing reviews for `Phantom'
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reviews of the new ``Star Wars'' movie are in, and, in the words
of Han Solo, we have a bad feeling about this. ``Episode I: The
Phantom Menace'' is panned by the major magazines, with reactions
ranging from the gentle reprimand to the slam.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in Time ($3.50), Richard Corliss calls it the ``Phantom
Movie,'' high on special effects and low on character. Director
George Lucas ``was more interested in the aliens than the humans
and in the art direction than the direction of actors.'' Corliss
acknowledges that the movie may be a victim of its own
unprecedented hype, which rivaled that of the run-up of ``Gone With
the Wind,'' but adds that the final two parts of the new trilogy
could redeem this bad start. ``Hype, after all, is just moviespeak
for hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek's ($3.50) David Ansen is more blunt: ``The movie is a
disappointment. A big one.'' Despite some marvelous set pieces,
including Anakin Skywalker's zippy Podracer contest, ``Phantom''
fails to hint how this likable tot will morph into big bad Darth
Vader. This Ansen calls ``a rudimentary failure of storytelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas is given high marks for incorporating digital effects into
the live-action flow, but, writes Ansen, ``All the state-of-the-art
technology in the world is no help to an actor saddled with Lucas's
tinny dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Other publications have also weighed in on ``Phantom,''
including a rasher of newspapers that broke the gentleman's
agreement not to review advanced screenings until opening day, May
19. The daily Variety reports on the displeasure at 20th Century
Fox, while also letting on that the film is a letdown.
</P>
<P>
   In the 25 years since its creation, the Durham, N.C.-based
Southern Exposure ($5) has maintained a contrary voice, championing
a man-the-barricades style in the heart of the conservative South.
Published by the Institute for Southern Studies, the bimonthly
celebrates its first quarter century by visiting 25 key leaders in
the South, including former Georgia state legislator Julian Bond,
who says, ``I could defeat Jesse Helms. Easily. It just takes
organizing.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The good empire: In the New Yorker ($3), Oliver Morton
re-reads the father of galactic empires, Isaac Asimov, whose
``Foundation'' series was everything ``Star Wars'' isn't. `` `Star
Wars' is about speed, faith and fairy tales, and the `Foundation'
is about size, science and history.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Mona's mysteries: Smithsonian ($4) deconstructs the most
famous painting in the world. Apparently there is no evidence that
Lisa, the wife of Florentine official Francesco del Giocondo,
actually posed for the famed Mona Lisa, but absent that provenance
the Smithsonian examines layers of outrageous explanations for the
notorious half-smile, including theories that the model suffered
from a stroke, had mercury-blackened teeth and was a beardless
Leonardo da Vinci himself.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Blowing bubbles: Investors in booming Internet stocks may take
an interest in the story of the South Sea Co., a notorious
speculative bubble that burst in 1720. Writing in Harvard Magazine
($4.95), Christopher Reed draws on manuscripts from the
university's Kress Library to describe how South Sea stock jumped
from 128 pounds on Jan. 1, 1720, to nine times that value in June.
Secured with scant evidence of underlying value (sound familiar?),
the South Sea edifice came crashing down by September.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Who's hot? Atlanta star Monica is first up among the 21
hottest stars under 21 in Teen People ($2.99), followed by Britney
Spears.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Milosevic and the Serbs:
</P>
<P>
   The New Republic's ($3.50) Stacey Sullivan says the lack of
resistance from Serb civilians to the Serb campaign of terror
against ethnic Albanians amounts to what seems like approval; that
the rank and file Serbs are in fact Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's ``willing executioners.''

 &HT;    No icy track needed for U.S. Bobsled Team tryouts
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The U.S. Bobsled Team is conducting tryouts for the
2002 Olympic team Saturday in Marietta, Ga., with no fee and no ice
_ and no bobsleds.
</P>
<P>
   By taking a simple four-item test that looks like it belongs in
a physical education class, candidates can tell if they have the
speed and explosiveness to be good push athletes. Herschel Walker
took a similar test before making the 1992 Olympic team, although
his scores were not among the highest.
</P>
<P>
   The events _ vertical jump, five consecutive hops, 30-meter
sprint and 60-meter sprint _ are given point values like those in a
decathlon. The men and women scoring highest in tryouts across the
country will be invited to a training camp this summer in Lake
Placid, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Mike Dionne, one of six Georgians to make the 1998
Olympic team, got started five years ago. Dionne, who is helping
coordinate the event at Life University's track facility, read a
newspaper article about tryouts in North Carolina, where he lived
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went just for fun and had no intention of making the team,''
said Dionne. ``Four years later, I'm going to the Olympics in
Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nagano Olympics turned into an ordeal for Dionne, who tested
positive for a banned stimulant that he had taken inadvertently. He
was allowed to stay in Nagano but could not compete.
</P>
<P>
   Dionne said he and Olympic officials have ``put it behind us,''
but he also said, ``For the rest of my life, I will think what they
did was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not have to give up his Olympic clothing, but the U.S.
Olympic Committee denied his request for an Olympic ring.
</P>
<P>
   Dionne said he went through some depression after Nagano but
bounced back when the 1998-99 season began. Now a driver, he was
sent to Europe to train.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have the pressure of having to race,'' he said. ``We
could take our time and learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Dionne and Garrett Hines, another '98 Olympian, are the only two
Georgians who have committed to training for Salt Lake City. U.S.
Bobsled relies on national tryouts to add depth to its program. The
men's team is still looking for its first Olympic medal, and
women's bobsled is hoping to attain Olympic status for the 2002
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Men and women 18-35 years old are eligible for the tryouts. They
need only running shoes; sprint spikes are recommended.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of a top score, consider Dionne's results _
vertical jump, 35.5 inches; five consecutive hops, 15.7 meters;
30-meter sprint, 3.67 seconds; and 60 sprint, 6.67 seconds.
Walker's scores for the same events were 30.5 inches, 15.25 meters,
3.70 seconds and 6.67 seconds. The average for top women is 22
inches, 10.8 meters, 4.25 seconds and 7.65 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   In the sprints, the timing eye is 1 meter after the start, which
takes place from a small platform.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 people attended a recent tryout in Springfield, Mass.,
and five were invited to the training camp. Athletes _ including
those not invited _ must pay their own way to Lake Placid. However,
if they pass additional tests, their room and board will be free.
Contenders also must run a 100 sprint and throw a 16-pound shot put
with both hands from a crouch position.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic training center in Lake Placid has wheeled sleds, so
athletes can practice loading, but they won't see ice until October
when they travel to Park City, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Dionne said that's when some potential Olympians get derailed.
``A lot of guys do (the tryouts), go to Lake Placid for summer
camp, then get on the ice in October and say, `Whoa, this isn't for
me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. BOBSLED TEAM TRYOUTS
</P>
<P>
   _ When; where: 9 a.m. Saturday; Life University track facility,
Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   _ Who: Men and women from ages 18 through 35.
</P>
<P>
   _ What to bring: Running shoes, with sprint spikes recommended.
</P>
<P>
   _ What you'll do: Four-event test consists of vertical jump,
five consecutive hops, 30-meter sprint, 60 sprint.
</P>
<P>
   _ To register: Call 1-800-Bobsled, ext. 103 or 108.

   If, as some paleontologists believe, the earliest birds learned
to fly by flapping their wings while running (as opposed to
climbing trees and gliding down from them), then they had to
achieve a certain takeoff velocity as well. For the earliest known
bird, archaeopteryx, which lived about 140 million years ago, this
has always presented a problem. Its estimated running speed of
about 2 meters per second (about 4.5 miles an hour) is far slower
than the velocity needed to get off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But a new aerodynamic analysis of archaeopteryx, by researchers
from the San Diego and Los Angeles County natural history museums,
shows how the bird could have closed this velocity gap.
</P>
<P>
   According to this analysis, published in the current issue of
Nature, the bird's flapping wings generate both lift and thrust.
The thrust adds to the propulsive force generated by the bird's
hind limbs, while the lift helps remove some of the body weight
from the hind limbs, allowing the bird's speed to increase even
more. The researchers calculated that within three seconds of
beginning its run, archaeopteryx could achieve a speed of about 8
meters per second, enough to become airborne.
</P>
<P>
   Elephants' Swim Trunks
</P>
<P>
   If the earliest birds were out flapping their wings, the
ancestors of elephants, it seems, were lolling about in the water.
</P>
<P>
   There is much information, both from fossils and molecular
analysis, to suggest that elephants and sea cows share a common
ancestor, one that was aquatic. Now, a rare chance to examine an
embryo and early fetuses of the African elephant has uncovered
further evidence that elephants had a marine past.
</P>
<P>
   The seven specimens, which were collected from elephants killed
as part of an effort to reduce herds in a South African national
park, ranged from 58 days to 166 days (an elephant pregnancy
usually lasts about 660 days). They were examined by Australian
researchers, who described their work in The Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The most important finding noted by the researchers was the
presence in the developing kidneys of funnel-shaped ducts called
nephrostomes. These are a characteristic of freshwater fish and
frogs, but have never been found in other mammals (other than
egg-layers like the platypus).
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also suggest that the elephant's trunk, which
was evident even in the earliest fetuses studied, might have
evolved as an adaptation to an aquatic environment. Proto-elephants
may have used it as a snorkel, much as modern elephants do when
they swim in deep water.
</P>
<P>
   A Bat's Favorite Flower
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to fathom how a pollinating insect or bird could be
attracted to a flower by its appearance. But hundreds of species of
plants are pollinated by bats, which are sightless. So how does a
bat, with only a sonarlike ability to navigate, find its favorite
flower?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, in one case at least, is that it gets help from the
flower itself. Two German scientists, writing in Nature, have
described a type of tropical vine whose flowers include a petal,
called a vexillum, that rises up when the flower matures. This
petal, which is concave, acts like an acoustical mirror, serving to
efficiently reflect a bat's echolocating signals back to it.
</P>
<P>
   The vexillum has a structure that allows it to send back strong
signals, even if the source of the signal is off to one side. So a
passing bat, sending out a stream of acoustic signals, will receive
a series of strong return signals from the same point, allowing it
to determine the flower's location.

   It's no strain to arrange a demanding excursion on the Web. Just
go to your search engine and type in a key word like ``kayak'' or
``climb'' and follow the trail. When I typed ``backpacking'' into
Yahoo's travel subsection, 16 sites were listed, ``kayak'' brought
seven, and ``climb'' 171. There are scores of such sites, and
following are examples of what you'll find. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PLANNING A HIKE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.nehikingholidays.com &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New England Hiking Holidays offers trips along trails of a range
of difficulty; at night, you relax in an inn. Despite the service's
name, the hikes are not limited to New England. There are also
offerings in the American South, Southwest, Hawaii, Canada and
Europe. The site is clean and easy to navigate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the treks offered this year are a five-day $1,065 hike
($1,125 in fall) in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, where
Clare and Kurt Grabher, who operate New England Hiking Holidays,
live; five days in the Shenandoahs, also $1,065, and a week on the
southwest coast of Ireland (Counties Clare and Kerry), at $1,935.
The prices are complete, including lodging and food, taxes and
tips, although you do have to get to the place on your own. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hiking day begins at around 9 a.m. with a trip either on
foot or by van to the start of the trail, and ends back in the inn
in mid to late afternoon. Lunch is taken on the trail at a
picturesque spot, if one is available, or in a pub or roadside inn.
There are two guides with the group to accommodate both people who
want to stroll and those who want a strenuous hike. &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   RIVER ADVENTURES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.riversearch.com &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 whitewater outfitters from 10 countries are
gathered together on Riversearch. Canoeists, rafters and kayakers
point to an area on a list, click and view a map on screen; listed
alongside are the names of Riversearch members who operate on that
river. Most of the rivers are in North America, but a few others
are in Costa Rica, Peru, Ecuador, Chile, South Africa, Australia,
Fiji and China.
</P>
<P>
   I clicked on the Great Bend of the Yangtze River and was
connected to an outfitter, Earth River in upstate New York, that
features two weeks on the Yangtze for $3,600. Whatever you click
on, you ultimately find yourself at the outfitter's Web sites, some
neat and some not so, with a range of offerings there. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BACKPACKING
</P>
<P>
   www.geocities.com/TheTropics/8168/travel.html &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to commercial sites, you can find home pages with
personal comments on the kind of activity you're researching by
using the same method: type in the search term and hope for the
best. I lucked into the Worldly Backpacking Page, a free home page
on the Geocities service, where the proprietor, identified only as
Eric, gives details and snapshots of his own travels, offers
numerous tips, and includes links to such related sites as youth
hostels and places to make reservations.
</P>
<P>
   For novice backpackers there's a checklist of how to prepare for
the first trip, as if you wouldn't have thought to check your
finances or make an itinerary, and guides to costs. A main point of
backpacking is that it is an inexpensive way to travel. How
inexpensive? ``I figure that it'll cost about $650 to $950 for
every two weeks that you travel in Europe,'' Eric says, adding that
the United States should be ``much cheaper'' and Asia _ well, it's
a big place and he doesn't much get into it.
</P>
<P>
   Geocities, like other services, lets individuals construct their
own home pages, in all their amateurish glory, for no charge,
although you do have to put up with an advertisement.

 &HT;    Small town mourns passing of beloved doctor
 &HT;    By Alan Judd
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLQUITT, Ga. _ One told of how Dr. Peggy Rummel would drop
anything she was doing to help a child in need. Another recalled
how she would volunteer for any civic cause without being asked.
Still another remembered how she would treat anyone who needed
care, occsionally accepting eggs and chickens as payment for her
services _ ``and sometimes hogs, if she had to.''
</P>
<P>
   One by one Monday, her friends and neighbors stood inside the
sunlit sanctuary of the Colquitt United Methodist Church to relate
the many ways that Rummel, who died Friday of liver cancer at age
43, had enriched this small southwestern Georgia community.
</P>
<P>
   And almost to a person, they said they never expected to meet
her likes again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peggy was the most giving person I've ever seen,'' said John
Lane, Rummel's accountant, who described the bartering she had
resorted to as one of Colquitt's four physicians. ``She's
irreplaceable.''
</P>
<P>
   Rummel's good deeds, from taking in foster children to fighting
for the local hospital's survival, came to light after she received
national and international publicity for her unusual search for a
replacement. She was so determined that her work treating the poor
and delivering babies at the Miller County Hospital continue after
her death, she posted a letter on the Internet pleading for another
physician to take over her practice.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, just three days before she died, she met the new
physician, Dr. Ifekan-Shango Simon of Columbus, Ga., who will move
to Colquitt next month. His wife gave birth over the weekend, and
he did not attend the Monday service.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much has been written about this fine lady,'' the Rev. Eric
Sizemore, pastor of Colquitt United Methodist, told the 120
mourners who attended Monday's memorial. ``There's been a lot of
hype. But I haven't heard anything that wasn't true.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourners did more than extol Rummel's accomplishments, though.
They also reveled in what Sizemore called her ``droll, warped sense
of humor.'' He told of times when she would subtly deflate pompous
speakers at public meetings, and another friend, India Taylor,
recalled a patient who complained about hospital food: ``Oh,''
Rummel responded, ``what is the burnt offering for the evening?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're supposed to feel sad today, and a part of me
does,'' Sizemore said. ``But I praise God for her life.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that, even in death, Rummel would continue her
``noble work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't be heaven to Peggy,'' he said, ``if she had to sit
around on a cloud and pluck on a harp.''

GROUPS DEBATE SAFETY OF CANNED TUNA FOR THE VERY YOUNG 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(lh) 
 By NANCY BETH JACKSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Based on a sampling of mercury levels in canned tuna, a
coalition of environmental and health care groups has written a
report urging pregnant women to avoid the fish entirely and advised
mothers of preschoolers to serve up no more than one tuna salad
sandwich a week.
</P>
<P>
   Although federal guidelines were used to gauge risk, the Food
and Drug Administration questioned the report's findings, calling
them very suggestive, very preliminary and highly uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Tuna fish has too much mercury to be eaten regularly by pregnant
women and young children, said Charlotte Brody, a registered nurse
who is one of the coordinators of Health Care Without Harm, which
worked with the Environmental Working Group in preparing the
report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't mean to suggest all people should stop eating
tuna,'' Ms. Brody said. ``Our concern is what mercury can do to the
development of the fetus and young children.''
</P>
<P>
   The group bought 27 samples of chunk light canned tuna and
frozen fish sticks and shrimp at grocery stores in San Francisco,
Chicago and Washington, and had mercury content analyzed by an
independent laboratory. The average level of methyl mercury _
mercury as it accumulates in fish tissue _ in the tuna was 0.09
parts per million or just under the 0.1 ppm limit the FDA set for
human consumption in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The report claims that a 4-year-old eating one 6-ounce can of
chunk light tuna a week over several months could suffer subtle but
permanent brain and nervous system damage. A pregnant woman,
particularly in the first trimester, could expose her fetus to an
unsafe dose of the metal by eating a half can of chunk light a day,
the report also said. Todd Mettenbach, an analyst with the working
group and a principal author of the study, said that ``the science
around mercury levels is absolutely murky,'' but added, that
because of ``the history of mercury and what we are learning from
lead, it doesn't pay to take chances.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry
recognizes an increased risk of methyl mercury exposure for
developing fetuses and children under 4, but the FDA has set no
risk levels specific to women and children. The agency does advise
pregnant women and those of childbearing age to eat shark and
swordfish no more than once a month. Everyone else is advised to
eat no more than 6 ounces of these fish per week.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bolger, a toxicologist and chief of the FDA contaminants
branch, said that ``during prenatal life, humans are susceptible to
the toxic effects of high methyl mercury exposure levels.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is not clear,'' he added, ``is the effect, if any, on
fetuses at much lower levels _ those that approach current exposure
levels through normal fish consumption.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolger pointed out that federal guidelines are screening values
rather than absolutes and have come under reconsideration following
studies completed since the FDA and Environmental Protection Agency
set risk standards. He cited a University of Rochester study,
reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association last
year, which found that children in the Seycelles, where residents
have mercury levels about 10 times higher than in the United States
were ``without any detectable adverse influence of mercury.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also urges reductions in mercury pollution in the air
to help decrease mercury levels in fish.

   &UR; ADOPTION BLUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Deep within a forest a little turtle began to climb a tree.
After hours of effort, he reached the top, jumped into the air
waving his front legs, and crashed to the ground. After recovering,
he slowly climbed the tree again, jumped, and fell to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The turtle tried again and again while a couple of birds sitting
on a branch watched his sad efforts. Finally, the female bird
turned to her mate. ``Dear,'' she chirped, ``I think it's time to
tell him he's adopted.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MUM, SEND $ &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A kid calls up his mum from his college and asks her for some
money.
</P>
<P>
   Mum says, ``Sure, sweetie. Mum will send you some money. You
also left your calculus book here when you visited two weeks ago.
Do you want me to send that up too?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Uhh, oh yeah, OK,'' responds the kid.
</P>
<P>
   So Mum wraps the book up along with the checks in a package,
kisses Dad goodbye, and goes to the post office to mail the money
and the book.
</P>
<P>
   When she gets back, Dad asks, ``Well how much did you give the
boy this time?''
</P>
<P>
   Mum says, ``Oh, I wrote two checks, one for $20, and the other
for $1000, out to him''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thats $1020!!!'' yells Dad, ``Are you crazy???''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry hun,'' Mum says, kissing Dad on the on top of his
bald head, ``I taped the $20 check to the cover of his book, but I
put the $1000 one somewhere between the pages in chapter 19!''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ALL RISE! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A minister was preoccupied with thoughts of how he was going to
ask the congregation to come up with more money than they were
expecting for repairs to the church building.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, he was annoyed to find that the regular organist was
sick and a substitute had been brought in at the last minute. The
substitute wanted to know what to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a copy of the service,'' he said impatiently. ``But
you'll have to think of something to play after I make the
announcement about the finances.''
</P>
<P>
   During the service, the minister paused and said, ``Brothers and
Sisters, we are in great difficulty; the roof repairs cost twice as
much as we expected, and we need $4,000 more. Any of you who can
pledge $100 or more, please stand up.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, the substitute organist played, ``The Star
Spangled Banner.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LIONS AND TIGERS AND BEARS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A woman called to make reservations, ``I want to go from Chicago
to Hippopotamus, New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The agent was at a loss for words. Finally, the agent, ``Are you
sure that's the name of the town?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, what flights do you have?'' replied the customer.
</P>
<P>
   After some searching, the agent came back with, ``I'm sorry,
ma'am. I've looked up every airport code in the country and can't
find a Hippopotamus anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The customer retorted, ``Oh don't be silly. Everyone knows where
it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Check your map!''
</P>
<P>
   The agent scoured a map of the state of New York and finally
offered, ``You don't mean Buffalo, do you?''

 &HT;    Computerized voice causes stir on airwaves
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you tuned into Atlanta radio last week to hear
updates on the severe weather, you probably noticed a strange sound
coming from your speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Several stations, including news/talk giant WSB (750 AM),
new-rock station 99X and lite-rock station Peach 94.9, had
programming interrupted by the beep-beep-beep from the National
Weather Service (not so unusual). But the tornado warning that
followed perhaps can be best described as otherworldly _ a freaky
echo resembling the voice of the ``Lost in Space'' robot speaking
in Hindi.
</P>
<P>
   No, interplanetary invaders have not landed at Weather Service
headquarters in Peachtree City (GA.). The sound is part of the
agency's new NOA Weather Radio 2000 system. And the mystery voice
isn't human, it's computer-generated.
</P>
<P>
   The NWS has been using the system since February to provide
weather warnings to North Georgia, replacing human announcers. Some
stations, such as WSB (the official station of the Emergency
Activation System), have opted to use the NWS voice even though it
has prompted calls from baffled listeners. Others, such as WGST,
have chosen to remain with live announcers because management
considers the computer voice ``emotionless and antiseptic,'' says
program director Ken Charles.
</P>
<P>
   John Talbert, WSB director of technical operations, concedes
that not everyone in the industry favors the new sound and that
``the issue is a big topic of debate among broadcasters'' all over
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's a little awkward, but we feel it's important to get
the information on the air immediately,'' Talbert says. ``In
minutes, you can have a tremendous amount of damage to lives and
property. I say if there's a way to lessen that amount of time,
let's do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The new system may let the agency get warnings out as much as
``two to three minutes sooner'' than the old method, says NWS
science operations officer Gary Beeley. But it also has caused a
bit of a stir among listeners apparently confused by the aesthetics
of what they are hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thinks we've hired a foreign worker to come over and
do a radio broadcast,'' says Frank Taylor, NWS data acquisition
program manager. And apparently no one can quite decided the
nationality of the new voice. ``It runs the gamut, from Middle
Eastern to Indian to Scandinavian to Korean to Mexican.''
</P>
<P>
   According to WSB's Talbert, the computer voice sounds the way it
does because of the technology required to create the words.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason they had to go with this is because the vocabulary
required (for weather reports) is phenomenal,'' he says. ``It has
to be able to deliver the names of every creek, river, stream,
adjoining waterway and wide spot in the road. So it takes the text
and sounds out the words phonetically unlike, say, a short
computer-generated phone message.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said even he was a little surprised when he first heard
the computer system ``talk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't what I expected, and it took a little getting used
to,'' he said. ``I come from a background where broadcasting has
always been done by humans, and this is definitely a change. But
what's amazing to me is that kids who tour our building don't think
it's a big deal. It's others who are having a hard time with it.''
</P>
<P>
   99X program director Leslie Fram says her young-end listeners
all seem to know the voice is a computer: ``No one thought it was
weird at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside of weather alerts, Atlantans can hear the voice give
updates around the clock over weather radios at 162.55 megahertz.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor says NWS staffers haven't yet come up with a nickname for
their new office mate. ``We're open for suggestions.''

 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A tantalizing clue to the atom spies of a half-century ago
centers on Santa Fe, N.M., just down the road from Los Alamos,
where thousands of scientists and other experts worked on the bomb,
Washington's great wartime secret, sheltered by the tall pines and
deep canyons of the New Mexican wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   New research suggests that among the adobe walls and Indian
curios of the Santa Fe plaza was a drugstore whose spare rooms
served as a safe house, just as a Stalin-era spy chief has
suggested. In this refuge, Los Alamos experts are said to have
given Moscow the intellectual heart of the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no doubts about it,'' said Jerrold Schecter, a former
Moscow bureau chief for Time magazine who has written one book on
the espionage and is working on another. He and rival investigators
say new signs, including New Mexican records, support the existence
of the safe house, no trace of which remains today.
</P>
<P>
   The atomic betrayals of the 1940s have grown steadily in
estimated number and import over the decades to the point that
today a small army of scholars is working hard at tracking and
unmasking spies. A rush of recent books list new cover names, point
to suspects long dead and _ in one case based on circumstantial
evidence _ confront a living scientist with accusations of
espionage.
</P>
<P>
   The digging has nothing to do with current fears of Chinese
spying at Los Alamos but shows how suspicions can linger for
decades and how damage assessments can grow over time.
</P>
<P>
   The most damning evidence comes from the federal government
itself. In recent years it has declassified more than 3,000
messages between Moscow and its spies in the 1940s that code
breakers were able to partly decipher. The unveiled discourse,
code-named Venona, led to the recent exposing of Theodore Hall, a
former Los Alamos physicist, and has raised questions about many of
Moscow's other scientific informants identified only by cover
names.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know they are spies,'' said Robert Louis Benson, a Venona
expert at the National Security Agency, a federal espionage group,
because the messages spell out such things as the passing of atom
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, Stalin knew more about the bomb than Truman
did when the president in 1945 told the Soviet leader that the
United States had developed a new weapon of unusual destructive
force.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Soviets got an immense amount of information'' from known
spies and received more from ones now being uncovered, said Dr.
Gregg Herken, a historian at the Smithsonian Institution who is at
work on a book about atom scientists and espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Motives in the spying, scholars say, included not only
ideological sympathy for Moscow, but a desire to foster a balance
of terror so Washington would be unable to wage unilateral atomic
war, which some experts feared before the Cold War's deadlock took
hold.
</P>
<P>
   The drama began in earnest when Los Alamos (``the poplars'') was
founded in 1943 at what had been a rustic boy's school in the New
Mexican mountains. Its charismatic leader was J. Robert
Oppenheimer, a thin, pipe-smoking physicist with a fondness for the
Bhagavad Gita, the sacred Hindu text. ``I have become Death,
destroyer of worlds,'' he said, when a blinding flash revealed that
the first test of the weapon, on July 16, 1945, had been a success.
</P>
<P>
   Historians have long known that Klaus Fuchs, a top physicist,
betrayed the effort, as did David Greenglass, a machinist.
</P>
<P>
   But the Soviet collapse in 1991 brought new revelations. Russian
scientists said Moscow's first atom bomb, detonated in 1949, was an
exact copy of the main Los Alamos one, which was made of plutonium,
its core smaller than a softball. Russians making the assertions in
1992 and 1993 included Yuli Khariton, scientific head of the Soviet
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Western experts viewed the claim as credible since scientists
are normally reluctant to share credit.
</P>
<P>
   So too, Russian intelligence officers alleged, often anonymously
or in disputed accounts, that as many as a dozen Soviet spies stole
atom secrets. One such account was ``Special Tasks'' (Little,
Brown, 1994), by Schecter, his wife, Leona, and Pavel Sudoplatov, a
Stalin-era spy chief.
</P>
<P>
   The Sudoplatov book contended that several top scientists,
including Oppenheimer and Neils Bohr, had aided the Soviet cause.
Many scholars ridiculed these sweeping assertions. But some
elements, like the safe house in a drugstore owned by a Soviet
agent who traveled frequently to Mexico, have recently gained
credibility among atom historians and investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Bradbury, who lives in Santa Fe and works with the
Smithsonian Institution's national associates program, researched
city records and interviewed old-timers, finding a site that
matched the book's descriptions. ``It fits very nicely,'' she said.
``If true, it speaks volumes about the depths of the Russian roots
into the project. It's pretty amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   New discoveries about what went on in the back of that
drugstore, and who visited, historians say, may eventually
materialize from the mountains of accumulating Russian and American
data. That goes especially for the Venona interceptions, which were
made public in 1995, 1996 and 1997 and to date have been only
partly analyzed publicly.
</P>
<P>
   The decryptions have already unmasked Hall, whose activities are
recounted in ``Bombshell'' (Random House, 1997), by Joseph Albright
and Marcia Kunstel. Hall, an American physicist who now lives in
Britain, was never prosecuted, despite overwhelming evidence of his
spying as ``Mlad,'' or youngster, his Soviet cover name, given when
he was 19.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Hall told the authors of ``Bombshell'' that while at
Los Alamos he regarded an American monopoly on nuclear arms as
dangerous. While he has never outright admitted to spying, he told
the authors, ``In essence, from the perspective of my 71 years, I
still think that brash youth had the right end of the stick.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholars now believe that in treason, if not idealism, Hall may
have had up to a dozen peers, matching early Russian assertions.
</P>
<P>
   John Earl Haynes of the Library of Congress and Harvey Klehr of
Emory University lay out some of the new evidence in ``Venona,'' a
book on the decryptions published Monday by Yale University Press.
They say still undiscovered atom spies had cover names like Erie,
Huron, Pers, Quantum and Volok.
</P>
<P>
   Quantum, who disgorged secrets as early as 1943, delivered both
bomb descriptions and documents, ``Venona'' says. And he demanded
payment, unlike Hall. Among Quantum's revelations was a process of
gaseous diffusion being developed to separate uranium 238 from
uranium 235, the key isotope needed for a type of bomb fuel
different from plutonium.
</P>
<P>
   Pers, Russian for Persian, was a spy who emerged in 1944 cables,
including a lengthy one on the kind secrets he turned over to
Moscow. ``Unfortunately,'' the authors of ``Venona'' say, ``only a
few parts of the report were deciphered.''
</P>
<P>
   Huron, the authors say, was a spy in 1944 and 1945 and may have
been Bruno Pontecorvo, a physicist who defected to the Soviet Union
in 1950 and died in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Espionage saved the USSR great expense and industrial
investment,'' the ``Venona'' authors conclude, enabling the
Russians to build a successful bomb ``years before they otherwise
would have.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet another book, ``Haunted Wood'' (Random House, 1999),
combines the Venona decryptions with materials from Russian spy
archives. Its authors are Allen Weinstein of the Center for
Democracy, in Washington, and Alexander Vassiliev, a former KGB
agent who now lives in Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Among its revelations is a 1944 Russian report asserting that
Oppenheimer, code-named Chester, was a secret member of the
American Communist Party, and that the party was ordered to cease
relations ``to avoid compromising him'' at Los Alamos. But the
authors found no evidence that the long-dead scientist was a spy,
nor were they able to corroborate the claim of secret party
membership.
</P>
<P>
   Still another book and investigation have provoked a furor in
atomic circles with accusations against a living scientist who held
central roles at Los Alamos and was a student of Oppenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   Prompted by the Sudoplatov book, Jeremy Stone, president of the
Federation of American Scientists, a private group in Washington
that advocates arms control, in 1994 began looking into accusations
of spying because his group had been founded by atomic scientists.
He drew on Russian clues, including what was said to be a
transcript from the recruitment interview of a spy code-named
Perseus (today thought to be Pers, a composite of several spies or
pure disinformation).
</P>
<P>
   In it, Perseus expressed concern about the dangers of nuclear
holocaust and said that American physicists had been ``cheated'' by
their military leaders into being afraid that Nazi Germany would
get the atomic bomb first. Stone, who was well acquainted with
living atom veterans, thought he heard in such phrases the voice of
his old friend Dr. Philip Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   A physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
public-television eminence, Scientific American book reviewer and
disarmament statesman, Morrison, 83, is one of the nation's most
distinguished astrophysicists. As a young man in the 1930s,
however, he was a member of the American Communist Party, like many
intellectuals of the day. Morrison received his Ph.D. from the
University of California at Berkeley in 1940 under Oppenheimer's
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   During the wartime effort at Los Alamos, Morrison was in charge,
among other things, of delivering the plutonium core of the first
atom bomb to a test site in the New Mexican desert. More
importantly, he had helped evaluate German intelligence for the
project's military overseer, Gen. Leslie Groves, and so, in Stone's
view, would have known that the Germans were getting nowhere with
their bomb effort.
</P>
<P>
   While making no direct accusations, Stone, in a series of
increasingly elaborate meetings, talked with Morrison of growing
atomic investigations and the possibility of getting congressional
immunity from prosecution for old spies who agreed to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Referring only to a ``Dr. X,'' Stone describes these encounters
in a chapter of his new memoir, ``Every Man Should Try: Adventures
of a Public Interest Activist,'' published April 20 by Public
Affairs. After initially refusing to confirm the scientist's
identity, which historians had quickly guessed and discussed
widely, Stone eventually named his suspect in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The book portrays the meetings as becoming highly charged, the
suspect ``visibly frightened,'' his knees knocking together, and
Morrison's wife becoming agitated. Eventually, Stone detailed the
circumstantial case in a letter to Morrison, which prompted a flat
denial and abruptly ended the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with The New York Times, Morrison strongly denied
any spying and likened Stone's accusations to those of the McCarthy
era, full of innuendo but nothing more. He denounced the assertions
as ``outrageously unfair and false'' and ``devoid of any objective
tests.''
</P>
<P>
   His innocence, he wrote, can be shown by a willingness to reply
to any specific accusations and by the fact that for a half-century
federal law-enforcement officials had never made a single claim of
any wrongdoing or breach of trust. ``It all depends on how I
trembled,'' Morrison said dismissively of the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   As for Perseus' feeling that Los Alamos scientists had been
tricked into working against a Nazi bomb, Morrison said he was one
of the last federal analysts to feel the Germans were far behind.
In the summer of 1944, he said, he would scan his shortwave for
British broadcasts, fearful that ``London would disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Morrison said she never believed her husband was a spy,
contrary to the book's implications. ``I've had every reason to
believe otherwise,'' she said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Priscilla McMillan, an atom historian at Harvard University and
the secretary of the Federation of American Scientists, Stone's
group, echoed the outrage of many scholars in saying the assertions
were without merit. ``It's a smear in search of a crime, a criminal
and some evidence,'' she said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Stone argues that a congressional hearing and
immunity could help cut through the fog of suspicion that swirls
around many atomic scientists, alive and dead. Giving Dr. X
immunity, he says, would allow history to ``ascertain, among other
things, his motives and whatever else he knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholars say the hunt for atom spies, a half-century after the
fact, is unlikely to cool and may heat up as new evidence is
weighed, including that of a Soviet safe house hidden in the midst
of Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know from Venona, which we can trust, that they are out
there,'' Gregg Herken of the Smithsonian Institution said of atom
spies.
</P>
<P>
   A problem for scholars, he added, is the issue of legal
liability and living suspects who might sue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like the truth to come out,'' he said, ``but I don't
want to libel anybody.''

   TOKYO _ On the walls of the classrooms are stern portraits of
North Korea's late ``Great Leader'' and his son the ``Dear
Leader,'' and a huge banner on the gymnasium declares, ``Great
Leader Marshal Kim Il Sung Is With Us Forever.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is obvious that this high school is in Tokyo, not North
Korea, when a cluster of giggly teeny-boppers bounce up and test
their English by asking about something really important to
16-year-old hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you like the Backstreet Boys?'' asked Yun Mi Hyang, a
junior at the Korean High School in Tokyo, and she and her friends
paused breathlessly. ``You know, the Backstreet Boys. Kevin! Nick!
Brian! Oh, they are so great! The best American band. I love their
music.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Yun and the other students at the Korean High School come
across, in short, as the world's funkiest Stalinists. But the 137
North Korea-backed schools in Japan _ partly financed by North
Korea and run by North Koreans who are long-term residents of Japan
_ are caught in a growing crisis, for it is becoming ever more
difficult to balance loyalties to Great Leaders and to the
Backstreet Boys.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the 650,000 ethnic Koreans in Japan _ by far
Japan's largest minority _ seem to be at a crossroads and
increasingly to be choosing the Japanese path rather than the
Korean path. After half a century in which the Korean population in
Japan bridled and fought constantly with its hosts, it is becoming
more subdued, and every year more than 10,000 Koreans are taking
Japanese citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intermarriage is increasing, and taking of Japanese
nationality is increasing,'' Ku Dae Sok, the principal of the
Korean High School, said glumly as he sat in a spacious office with
memorabilia of Kim Il Sung scattered on the shelves. ``So I think
the trend for Koreans here is headed downhill.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's Koreans in Japan are mostly the grandchildren of those
who were brought here to work as manual laborers when Korea was a
Japanese colony early in this century.
</P>
<P>
   Most were from what is now South Korea, but in the postwar era
many were contemptuous of the American-backed government in the
South. Many Koreans felt that the true nationalistic credentials
belonged to Kim Il Sung, who fought Japanese troops during World
War II and who established a fervently nationalistic government in
the North.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot was that most of Japan's Koreans initially inclined
toward the North, not so much because of its Communist political
system as because of patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   Japan discriminated harshly against the Koreans, even after the
war, and that cemented the nationalistic tendencies of the Korean
minority. The discrimination continues today, for Japan's Education
Ministry, which has traditionally been as prone to hard-line
ideologies as North Korea itself, bars graduates of Korean schools
from even applying to enter Japan's prestigious national
universities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the broader reason for the crisis in the Korean schools has
to do with changes among the Koreans themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original purpose of the schools was to prepare Koreans so
that they could go back to their homeland,'' said So Chung On, an
official of the pro-North Korean Chosun Soren organization in
Japan. ``But now young people have no intention of going back to
their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking account of that reality, our organization has been
trying to modify the contents of the education,'' So added. One
result is that the North Korean schools in Japan now study much
less politics and ideology, and the curriculum is fairly similar to
that of Japanese schools, except that classes are all conducted in
the Korean language.
</P>
<P>
   This flexibility in the curriculum has helped preserve the
support of some Korean parents, but even so, attendance of Korean
schools has fallen to 17,000 today, compared with 35,000 in 1967.
That reflects a significant waning of support for North Korea in
recent years among Japan's Korean population.
</P>
<P>
   Korean families in Japan used to send $100 million or more each
year in hard currency to North Korea, but now the aid has fallen to
a small fraction of that. One reason is the current recession in
Japan, but more important is that some Koreans in Japan look to
North Korea and now see not inspiration, but rather something
closer to embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, as South Korea has prospered and democratized and
emerged from beneath the American thumb, it has steadily gained
support. Now more Koreans in Japan are aligned with South Korea
than with the North.
</P>
<P>
   The South does not run full-fledged schools in Japan, so parents
usually send their children to Japanese schools and then sometimes
to Korean-language classes on the side.
</P>
<P>
   What keeps the North Koreans going, it seems, is not ideology or
politics, but nationalism and loyalty, for many still believe that
North Korea is far more authentically Korean than the South, which
they see as run by American quislings. Moreover, most Korean
families in Japan chose their sides a generation or two ago, and
switching camps now would be an unimaginable betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are people proud of their mothers only in good times and then
ashamed of their mothers when they run into troubles?'' asked Shin
Te Jyun, the president of the student body at the Korean High
School. ``No, of course not. We feel the same love for our mothers
in bad times as in good. And it's the same with our motherland.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greater challenge to the Korean schools is not that
pro-North Koreans will defect to the South, but rather that they
will join the flood of Koreans signing up for Japanese nationality.
Most Korean families in Japan now speak Japanese at home, and the
surge of naturalizations alarms many Korean stalwarts who see it as
a kind of cultural suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never think of becoming a Japanese citizen, because we
were colonized by Japan,'' said Sok Kyong Suk, a teacher at the
school. ``To become Japanese would be a humiliation.''

ON PARENTS DOING A TOUGH JOB AS WELL AS POSSIBLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL K. HARRAL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cries are predictable.
</P>
<P>
   After any tragedy involving children, but especially in the
aftermath of a shooting death, everyone wants to know why the
parents didn't do something to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   If only parents would take responsibility, people say.
</P>
<P>
   Let's stipulate that some parents _ perhaps many, maybe even
most _ aren't as involved with their children as they should be.
</P>
<P>
   What we overlook in our passion in the aftermath of something
like the Littleton, Colo., school shooting is that almost all
teen-agers are reasonably law-abiding.
</P>
<P>
   I say ``reasonably'' because I'm not sure all that much has
changed since I was in school four decades ago and we were known to
cut a corner or two when we thought we could get away with it.
</P>
<P>
   But my friends and I, like almost all of today's kids, sort of
knew when and where to stop. So far as I know, none of us wound up
in prison, although a few of us wound up dead in automobile
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The operative words above were ``when we thought we could get
away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not much got past the adults in my hometown. OK, so it was a
tiny town in the Panhandle of Texas, and that's a lot different,
you say, from city life in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   But everyone has a neighborhood of some sort.
</P>
<P>
   I can show you places in my current hometown that would scare
Mr. Rogers silly. But the people who live there are doing the best
they can to get along and to see that life is a little better for
their kids than it is for them. Nobody wakes up in the morning and
wonders: ``What can I do today to destroy my children's lives?''
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult realization for parents is that at some
point, they will not be in control of their teen-agers' lives. And
that is the time to look to other adults _ and sometimes to other
teen-agers _ for help.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what your kid is doing, someone somewhere knows about
it. But they may not be telling you what they see. You have to
invite and welcome that kind of information.
</P>
<P>
   It is time for us to get nosy again.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   _ There is no such thing as a right to privacy for children
living under your roof. Check their rooms frequently. If they've
left a shotgun barrel out on the chest of drawers, or if they've
got a tote sack of fertilizer in the corner, you might want to ask
questions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Learn how to check the history file on the computer to see
where they've been on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's a big sacrifice, but listen to your kids' music. If you
don't approve of it, seize the CDs or tapes. (See the first point
above.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Talk to them about the TV programs they watch and the video
games they play. Children do not need TV sets in their rooms. If
you don't like the games, take them up. (See the first point
above.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Know who your children's friends are. This is more difficult
than it might seem, because no one seems to have last names
anymore, but you can figure it out if you try. Insist that the
friends come into the house before your child can leave with them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Once you know who the friends are, find out the names of the
friends' parents and get to know them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get the parents together and take these vows: (1) Be
tattletales. (2) Don't get angry when another parent tells you
something you don't want to hear about your child. (Just say thanks
and investigate yourself.) (3) Set your standards of taste and
behavior high, and raise them when your child has friends over. (4)
When Johnny says that Raul's mother has invited him over to spend
the night, call and check. (See the first point above.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Know how much money your children have, and where they got it.
When they come home with money or objects that they didn't leave
home with, ask them where they got the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   _ Remember your own adolescence and keep that in mind.
Teen-agers are naturally sneaky, and the point is to be not their
friend but their parents. Usually you can do both, but if you
can't, best that you pick ``parent.'' They'll thank you later after
the hormones die down.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't be too quick to side with your child against the school
_ or any authority. (Just say thanks and do your own
investigation.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Know the warning signs. If a child who has been making good
grades suddenly slips, get worried. If children change the way they
dress, abruptly switch friends (especially to a more suspect
group), suddenly start sleeping more, gain or lose a noticeable
amount of weight or start wearing perfume or aftershave heavy
enough to mask a smell, get suspicious. It might just be that they
are teen-agers. Or it might mean that they have started on a
dangerous path. (See the first point above.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Cut a deal with your kids that they can always blame you when
they don't want to do something or when they want to come home
rather than stay out with their friends.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't assume that your child can't get into trouble. There's a
period during the teen years when the peer group is much more
influential than parents.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that even the teen-agers who walk the dark side
usually make it through.
</P>
<P>
   But do you want to leave that to chance?
</P>

&HT;        PA. ACLU FLOODED WITH STUDENT COMPLAINTS FOLLOWING COLORADO
INCIDENT
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, May 10 -- Pennsylvania teens have flooded the state
American Civil Liberties Union chapter with complaints of being
punished for violent writings and wearing black.
</P>
<P>
   Following the shooting rampage last month at a Colorado high
school, ACLU chapters around the nation are reporting an onslaught
of student or parent complaints similar to the 20 received by the
Pennsylvania office.
</P>
<P>
   One 14-year-old Harrisburg teen, who wrote in his journal for
English class that if he had a gun he would kill another person at
school, was suspended for 10 days and charged by police with
terrorist threats, ACLU officials said. Harrisburg school officials
did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid didn't have a gun, didn't have access to a gun and was
giving a response elicited by school officials in a class
assignment,'' said Stefan Presser, legal director for
Pennsylvania's ACLU. ``Does that mean nothing should be done? No.
But perhaps recommending the kid for counseling would have been a
better choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Presser said the other calls have come from around the state
alleging similar incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gotten dramatically more calls on this than anything
in a very long while,'' Presser said. ``That's a shame because we
want kids who need help to come to us as school officials and
adults. We don't want them to feel like their rights are being
violated.''
</P>
<P>
   National ACLU officials say the well-meaning attempts of
teachers or principals to preserve safety may be violating
students' rights. ACLU chapters send letters to school officials
describing the complaint, refer students to lawyers or help on
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Presser said one Pennsylvania teen, who listed names of
classmates on a piece of paper titled ``Hit List,'' was suspended
and charged by police with making terrorist threats.
</P>
<P>
   Another Pennsylvania teen got suspended after saying in class
that she could understand how someone who is teased continually
could lose control, Presser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true the Colorado kids should have sought help or been
given help,'' Presser said. ``But educators here are in a
democracy. They have the difficult job of having to balance the
need to spot troubled behavior but preserve the rights of teens
expressing themselves. Just because someone dresses a certain way
or writes a certain way doesn't mean they will be violent.''

NEXT: `CASES EMBARRASSING TO JUSTICE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If we needed more proof that the U.S. civil justice system is
out of control, we got it Friday when a jury in Michigan slapped a
TV talk show with $25 million in damages because a former guest on
the show killed another former guest.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been worse. The lawyer who represented the dead
guest's relatives had asked for more than $70 million.
</P>
<P>
   Don't you love it when jurors show restraint?
</P>
<P>
   The defendant in the case was ``The Jenny Jones Show,'' which
stars the onetime stand-up comic Jenny Jones. Do you suppose that
it ever occurred to Jones when she was firing off one-liners on
``Star Search'' oh so many years ago that one day she would be held
responsible for a murder she had nothing to do with?
</P>
<P>
   It probably didn't occur to Jones that such a thing could happen
until the jury's verdict was announced and she saw the smile on the
face of attorney Geoffrey Fieger, who represented the family of the
deceased talk-show guest.
</P>
<P>
   You remember Geoffrey Fieger. He's that shining light of
lawyerdom who parlayed his longtime representation of ``Dr.
Death,'' Jack Kevorkian, into a campaign for governor of Michigan.
Fortunately, Fieger wasn't elected. If he had been, the people who
voted against him might have been shopping for a hotshot attorney
to file a lawsuit against the people who voted for him.
</P>
<P>
   If there were an Obnoxious Lawyer Hall of Fame _ and we need
one, don't you think? _ Fieger would be a charter member. He argued
his case against Jenny Jones not just in the courtroom but on the
TV interview circuit, and his arguments left me no choice but to
side with his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Which I was inclined to do anyway. Not because I like Jones, who
is plenty obnoxious in her own right, or because I like her TV
show. There is nothing to like about her TV show.
</P>
<P>
   I favored the defendant in this lawsuit because I believe that
such lawsuits are outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   The whole deal started, most people know, when Jones decided to
do a program dealing with ``secret crushes.'' One of the crushees
was a heterosexual male named Jonathan Schmitz; the person who had
the crush on Schmitz was a gay man, Scott Amedure.
</P>
<P>
   According to news reports, Schmitz went to Amedure's mobile home
three days after the show was taped _ it was never broadcast _ and
shot Amedure to death with a shotgun. Schmitz was later convicted
of murder, but the conviction was overturned on appeal; he will be
retried.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what happened between the TV taping and the shooting is
not entirely clear. The Associated Press reported that lawyers
representing the show, which is owned by the Warner Bros.
entertainment conglomerate, said the killing might have been
related to a sexual encounter between Amedure and Schmitz. Fieger
insisted that no such encounter occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Fieger argued that Schmitz was mentally unstable, that he didn't
know that the secret admirer he would confront on the show was a
man, that the humiliation he suffered on the program drove him to
murder _ and that the folks who put on ``The Jenny Jones Show''
should have foreseen all this and never let it happen.
</P>
<P>
   A judge once advised me to never criticize a jury's verdict, but
I can't help it: If the jurors in the Jones case bought that batch
of baloney from Fieger _ and they obviously did _ they're dumb
enough to be guests on Jerry Springer's show.
</P>
<P>
   The simple reality here is that two adults agreed to appear on a
TV program that is well-known for its demeaning and embarrassing
content. If one of them later regretted his decision to participate
and for reasons known only to him committed a criminal act of
murder, well, that's a matter for the criminal courts to handle _
and they are in the process of handling it.
</P>
<P>
   It was tragic and horribly unfair that Scott Amedure became a
murder victim. But it is preposterous for his survivors to blame a
TV show for something that happened days after the show was taped.
</P>
<P>
   No one is to blame but Jonathan Schmitz.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Schmitz doesn't have $25 million. Warner Bros. does.

   No matter what your kid is doing, someone somewhere knows about
it. But they may not be telling you what they see. You have to
invite and welcome that kind of information.
</P>
<P>
   It is time for us to get nosy again.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   _ There is no such thing as a right to privacy for children
living under your roof. Check their rooms frequently. If they've
left a shotgun barrel out on the chest of drawers, or if they've
got a tote sack of fertilizer in the corner, you might want to ask
questions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Learn how to check the history file on the computer to see
where they've been on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's a big sacrifice, but listen to your kids' music. If you
don't approve of it, seize the CDs or tapes. (See the first point
above.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Talk to them about the TV programs they watch and the video
games they play. Children do not need TV sets in their rooms. If
you don't like the games, take them up. (See the first point
above.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Know who your children's friends are. This is more difficult
than it might seem, because no one seems to have last names
anymore, but you can figure it out if you try. Insist that the
friends come into the house before your child can leave with them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Once you know who the friends are, find out the names of the
friends' parents and get to know them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get the parents together and take these vows: (1) Be
tattletales. (2) Don't get angry when another parent tells you
something you don't want to hear about your child. (Just say thanks
and investigate yourself.) (3) Set your standards of taste and
behavior high, and raise them when your child has friends over. (4)
When Johnny says that Raul's mother has invited him over to spend
the night, call and check. (See the first point above.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Know how much money your children have, and where they got it.
When they come home with money or objects that they didn't leave
home with, ask them where they got the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   _ Remember your own adolescence and keep that in mind.
Teen-agers are naturally sneaky, and the point is to be not their
friend but their parents. Usually you can do both, but if you
can't, best that you pick ``parent.'' They'll thank you later after
the hormones die down.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't be too quick to side with your child against the school
_ or any authority. (Just say thanks and do your own
investigation.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Know the warning signs. If a child who has been making good
grades suddenly slips, get worried. If children change the way they
dress, abruptly switch friends (especially to a more suspect
group), suddenly start sleeping more, gain or lose a noticeable
amount of weight or start wearing perfume or aftershave heavy
enough to mask a smell, get suspicious. It might just be that they
are teen-agers. Or it might mean that they have started on a
dangerous path. (See the first point above.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Cut a deal with your kids that they can always blame you when
they don't want to do something or when they want to come home
rather than stay out with their friends.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't assume that your child can't get into trouble. There's a
period during the teen years when the peer group is much more
influential than parents.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that even the teen-agers who walk the dark side
usually make it through.
</P>
<P>
   But do you want to leave that to chance?

ON SCHEDULE, CHINESE PROTESTERS TAKE THEIR SHOTS AT U.S. EMBASSY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-DIPLO) 
(rm)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Chinese officials choreographed protests against the
U.S. Embassy here on Monday, with a relentless procession of tens
of thousands of demonstrators that lasted into the night.
</P>
<P>
   The marchers, who protested the bombing of the Chinese embassy
in Belgrade during a NATO raid on Friday, were ushered by police
officers to within 25 feet of the embassy. Many chanted ``Down with
American imperialism!'' and sang the Chinese national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   The protests were more controlled than those over the weekend.
But young men continued to heave pieces of brick against the
battered facade right over the helmeted militiamen, who were
apparently under orders only to prevent an outright invasion.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the situation over the weekend, when tens of
thousands of spontaneous anti-NATO protesters roamed almost at
will, the Beijing authorities had protest groups keep to a schedule
and designated their route through the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The governing Communist Party appeared to be attempting to
harness public passions to its own use. On Sunday and today,
government offices and social organizations in Beijing were
reportedly ordered to hold meetings and issue denunciations of the
embassy damage, which were duly reported by the press.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the protesters on Monday were university
students and faculty, arriving in groups on a schedule set by the
Public Security Bureau, some state companies also sent large
delegations.
</P>
<P>
   High school students, workers and others who showed up on their
own at the staging point were allowed either to tag along with an
approved group or to wait until enough strays had gathered to form
their own marching squad. As the night wore on, more agitated
workers and other citizens streamed in, some of them defying police
directions.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of how well the day's protests were staged,
representatives of major official religious groups arrived and
marched in sequence _ dozens of Buddhist monks, followed by a
contingent of Tibetan monks, then Taoist monks, then Catholic,
Protestant and Muslim leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I am a Chinese, why do you think I shouldn't come?''
snapped a Tibetan monk in a scarlet robe when he was asked why he
was marching.
</P>
<P>
   While Americans have been advised to exercise caution, the U.S.
Embassy has not ordered dependents to leave. International schools
have closed. Because of safety concerns, American consular
officials in Chengdu, where the official residence was burned early
Sunday, and in Shenyang have moved into hotels.
</P>
<P>
   At the American and British embassies, the government deployed
thousands of troops from the People's Armed Police, a special
anti-riot force under the military.
</P>
<P>
   The American ambassador remained in the embassy for the third
day, living on military rations.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon the Chinese foreign minister, Tang Jiaxuan,
telephoned the ambassador, James Sasser. Tang relayed four demands
to ``U.S.-led NATO'' regarding the bombing of China's embassy,
which killed three Chinese and set off the anti-American explosion
here.
</P>
<P>
   The demands, as described by Chinese authorities, were these:
</P>
<P>
   _An ``open and official apology'' to China and the victims'
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   _A thorough investigation.
</P>
<P>
   _Prompt disclosure of the results of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   _``To punish severely those responsible for the attack.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Sasser said he had complained in
return to the foreign minister that the state-run news media have
not reported the regrets already offered by President Clinton,
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and the ambassador
himself.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sasser has been stuck in the embassy since Saturday, along with
two political officers, eight marines and two security officers.
The American security officials decided it was too dangerous for
those inside to move through the hostile crowds, which have never
dispersed entirely.
</P>
<P>
   At one point on Sunday, when a frenzied crush seemed in danger
of overwhelming Chinese police guards, the Americans destroyed
``extensive amounts of sensitive material,'' Sasser said.
</P>
<P>
   Some demonstrators have been calling for a military response to
the Belgrade bombing. But even the most temperate among the
demonstrators, along with many people who did not march, are saying
President Clinton has not done nearly enough to atone for the
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll stop demonstrating only when America admits it made a
mistake and apologizes,'' said Sun Qingqiang, 30, an official in a
state aerospace corporation, as he waited his turn to shout at the
embassy. Sun said he had heard on foreign radio broadcasts about
Clinton's letter of regret but said, ``Clinton's apology was fake,
it was insincere.''
</P>
<P>
   Peng Weijun, a 20-year-old student of traditional medicine,
cracked a brick from the sidewalk in half as he approached the
embassy. ``Even throwing rocks can't express my true feeling of
anger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state-run news media continued to stoke outrage, repeating
that the bombing was an intentional criminal act. If anything,
public passions seem to be intensifying.
</P>
<P>
   With an angry fax, cultural authorities canceled the invitation
for the Boston Symphony to perform this week in Beijing. Monday
night, some cab drivers refused to pick up Americans, and in the
embassy district, people gathered on street corners to discuss how
China could exact military revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers filled with inflammatory accounts of the embassy
bombing and one-sided coverage of the conflict over Kosovo are
selling out quickly. Many people spend their evenings avidly
watching television news programs that have shown, for example,
wrenching scenes of a Chinese victim's father in Belgrade sobbing
as he handles his dead daughter's blood-stained quilt.
</P>
<P>
   This evening's national news broadcast also showed chanting
soldiers as a voice said, ``The powerful army of the Chinese people
will never tolerate the atrocity committed by the U.S.-led NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the bombing of the Chinese embassy, President Jiang
Zemin was under strong pressure from the military and the public to
take a stronger stance against the American-led air attacks in
Yugoslavia, which China calls illegal aggression. But Jiang has few
practical options and may be reluctant to destroy the improved
relations he has cultivated with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   China announced Monday morning that it was suspending its
official dialogue with the United States over human rights and
postponing high-level military contacts and consultations on
weapons proliferation, arms control and international security. No
mention was made of the negotiations on China's entry to the World
Trade Organization, which are at a climactic phase.
</P>
<P>
   Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, Russia's special envoy on the Yugoslav
crisis, suddenly arrived here today for consultations. Russia and
China are the strongest opponents of the NATO air attacks, and many
Chinese say the United States has proved to an unreliable
international partner, thus China must develop closer ties with
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   By general agreement, the champion of the day for creative
visual effects among the demonstrators was the contingent of
hundreds from the Central Academy of Arts. Ten years ago, in the
pro-democracy demonstrations on Tiananmen Square, students from
this institution erected the famous Goddess of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, academy students carried a panoply of creative
posters vilifying the United States. Some carried a giant replica
of Picasso's 1937 antiwar mural, ``Guernica,'' this one spattered
with red paint. Others had made a giant cardboard Statue of Liberty
with the face of Bill Clinton and with the figure holding a bloody
bomb instead of a torch.

`ENGLAND, ENGLAND': ENGLAND AS THEME PARK 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are two Englands in Julian Barnes' latest work of fiction:
Old England, which is more or less the England we know today but
divested of all its most famous historical landmarks; and England,
England, a snazzy new theme park offering upscale tourists the
quintessence of England (from the White Cliffs of Dover to Big Ben,
from Jane Austen to Queen Victoria, from Diana's grave to Harrods)
within easy sightseeing distance, a virtual, Disneyesque England,
``more convenient, cleaner, friendlier and more efficient'' than
the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   There are also two novels in Barnes' book ``England, England.''
The first is a wickedly funny satire that sends up greedy
developers, pompous intellectuals and conniving business tycoons;
the second is a wistful, philosophical portrait of a woman trying
to make sense of her life. The two novels are intercut clumsily
with each other to examine familiar themes concerning the
unreliability of memory and the elusiveness of the past _ themes
that have run through Barnes' work from ``Flaubert's Parrot''
(1985) to ``A History of the World in 10 1/2 Chapters'' (1989) and
``Cross Channel'' (1996).
</P>
<P>
   The character who connects the two novels in ``England,
England'' is Martha Cochrane, another of Barnes' stubbornly
independent women, a searcher looking for her real self. Martha, we
learn, grew up in the English countryside, where she learned
English history by memorizing important events and dates. She was a
child when her father left home and never came back. He told her
years later that he had left her mother for another woman and
thought ``a clean break was fairer all round.''
</P>
<P>
   Martha grew up headstrong, clever and outspoken. She graduated
from college with a degree in history and went to work in London.
Now, at 39, she is a consultant to Sir Jack Pitman, a blustering
entrepreneur with an outsize business and an even more outsize ego.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Jack likes to compare himself to Beethoven, and he has
decided that it's time for him to come up with his equivalent of
the Ninth Symphony as a capstone to his career. His idea, of
course, is England, England, which he plans to build on the Isle of
Wight. Its current residents, he figures, will be ``grateful future
employees''; its many thatched cottages will make perfect tea
shops.
</P>
<P>
   Consultants are duly called in. A French intellectual declares
that people now ``prefer the replica to the original,'' ``the
reproduction of the work of art to the work of art itself.'' And
one of Sir Jack's chief operatives asserts that tourists want to
``enjoy what they already know,'' that they do not travel to see
anything new but to savor their own preconceptions. Just what do
these potential customers think of when they think of England? A
poll taken by Sir Jack's people reveals that ``the 50 quintessences
of Englishness'' include the royal family, London taxis,
Shakespeare, Stonehenge, bowler hats, cricket, Beefeater and
marmalade.
</P>
<P>
   What Sir Jack's team can't build or re-create on the Isle of
Wight, they cavalierly buy. The king is paid to come live on the
Island for a generous fee, and so is the Manchester United Football
Club. Actors are hired to impersonate Samuel Johnson, Lady Godiva
and Robin Hood, and famous scenes from English history are
re-enacted several times a day. It's not long before the island has
seceded from England and become Sir Jack's own personal fief.
</P>
<P>
   Although Martha and her boyfriend Jack use sexual blackmail to
get Sir Jack to relinquish his control of England, England, the
project still succeeds beyond anyone's wildest dreams. While
England, England grows ever more prosperous, Old England, which had
lost its history and its sense of itself, slides into a decline.
Millions of people leave for sunnier shores, the economy collapses,
and the country retreats into a pastoral, primitive past.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes uses his copious talents as a writer _ his lapidary
prose, his eye for the askew detail, his ear for the
circumlocutions of contemporary speech _ to turn the saga of
England, England into an uproarious farce that mocks both our
postmodernist suspicion of the authentic and our Disney-like
willingness to turn that embrace of the ersatz into a money-making
machine. He examines the arbitrary nature of history writing and
the cyclical nature of history, and he satirizes the ideas that the
English hold about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   As for his story of Martha Cochrane's life (from her unhappy
childhood to her involvement with England, England, to her eventual
return to a small English village much like the one she grew up
in), it is sad and often touching _ as effective in evoking the
entire arc of a woman's life as his 1987 novel, ``Staring at the
Sun.'' The problem, however, is that in forcing Martha to inhabit
two novels, one comic and one not, Barnes has given her a split
personality: She behaves like a sharp-tongued boss lady in the
story of England, England and like a melancholy spinster in her own
biography; like a two-dimensional cartoon in the former and like an
old-fashioned, realistic heroine in the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes tries to link his two narratives by suggesting parallels
between a nation's invention of its own mythology and an
individual's invention of a self. He also has Martha say things
like, ``An individual's loss of faith and a nation's loss of faith,
aren't they much the same?'' Such strained efforts, unfortunately,
do not succeed in welding the two narratives in ``England,
England'' into a satisfying whole. The result is two finely turned
tales that add up to a disappointing third.

<P>
   When a classic convergence of tornado-producing forces shaped up
in southern Oklahoma on May 3, funnel-chasing scientists from the
university town of Norman scrambled like jet pilots, heading for
flatbed trucks carrying advanced radar that, they hope, will
eventually help find the key to a tantalizing, frustrating mystery:
How is a tornado born?
</P>
<P>
   The answer lies in the last few minutes of a complex chain of
events that begins when large-scale air masses clash and ends when
a twister rakes the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the process leading up to the critical moment of tornado
genesis is well understood. But unless and until research
meteorologists can solve the puzzle of the last crucial step, they
will be at a loss to predict whether a garden variety tornado is on
the way, or one so puny it will fall apart at the first obstacle it
hits, or a monster like one that struck the outskirts of Oklahoma
City on May 3, demolishing entire neighborhoods and killing dozens
of people.
</P>
<P>
   That tornado appears to have been one of the most powerful ever
observed. Its whirling winds were measured by meteorologists from
the University of Oklahoma at 318 miles an hour, which they believe
to be a record wind speed. More important, they were able to
approach to within about three-quarters of a mile of the big
tornado's center; there, with debris raining down around them, they
believe they captured the twister's birth on radar.
</P>
<P>
   The data will not be fully analyzed for some time, and much more
will be necessary before researchers can draw general conclusions
about tornado birth, life and death. Every tornado is a little
different, and they are all capricious, evanescent and hard to get
a fix on. But in time, the scientists believe, forecasters will be
able to predict not just that a tornado is coming, as they
presently can, but also how strong it will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any skill at that now,'' said Dr. Joshua Wurman,
one of the Oklahoma researchers.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the difficulty of trying to pin down the atmospheric
machinations that give birth to a tornado has proved ``just
excruciating,'' said Dr. Roger Wakimoto, a tornado expert who heads
the atmospheric sciences department at the University of California
at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Tornadoes are the product of thunderstorms that blossom when
cold, dry air masses meet warm, moist ones. This takes place along
the jet stream, the high-altitude, west-to-east river of air that
marks the boundary between cold polar air and warm tropical air.
When these air masses meet, warm, moist air near the ground rises,
and, when it meets colder air aloft, the moisture condenses into
rain.
</P>
<P>
   The falling rain drags down air with it, producing powerful
downdrafts. Sometimes, warm, dry air intrudes between the cold air
aloft and the warm, moist air near the ground. As the moist air
near the ground rises, it carries the drier air with it. The drier
air cools faster than the moist air and makes the situation even
more unstable, producing especially violent thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring in Tornado Alley, a swatch of the Great Plains
stretching across Kansas, Oklahoma and northern Texas, those
conditions are often met: The jet stream converges with warm, moist
air from the Gulf of Mexico and warm, dry air from the Mexican
plateau. In fact, ``those three ingredients come together more
frequently in Tornado Alley than anywhere else in the world,'' said
Fred Gadomski, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University.
More tornadoes develop there than anywhere else on the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The May 3 tornado developed from a variety of thunderstorm
called a supercell, which in turn was produced by just the kind of
convergence of elements described by Gadomski. A supercell is a
big, hulking storm distinguished by the internal presence of a
twisting, tilted updraft whose tilt enables it to avoid getting
tangled up with the storm's downdrafts. This updraft is therefore
more stable and long-lived, enabling the storm itself to live as
long as there is a supply of surface moisture. Supercells can
produce several tornadoes and are the main generator of the most
powerful and long-lasting ones.
</P>
<P>
   But the appearance of thunderstorms only sets the stage for
tornadoes, and only a few storms produce them. Certain conditions
within the storm must be met for a tornado to form. The most
important is wind shear _ cross-cutting winds of differing speeds
or directions. When two layers of wind move in the same direction
at different speeds, the effect is to set air between them
rotating, as when one twirls a pencil between one's palms.
</P>
<P>
   This horizontal roll of rotating air is pushed upward in the
center by the powerful updraft of warm, moist air feeding the
thunderstorm at its base. Eventually, the roll evolves into a
relatively slow-whirling vertical vortex called a mesocyclone. The
vortex then narrows and lengthens; this increases its speed, just
as a skater's whirl intensifies when she pulls her arms in close or
extends them over her head.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery is how that last step happens. It is at this
critical juncture, apparently, that tornadoes somehow become
stronger or weaker. Only a very few reach the status of F4 or F5 on
the Fujita scale of tornado damage _ tornadoes with winds of more
than 206 miles an hour. (F0 and F1, on the other end of the scale,
have winds of 40 to 112 miles an hour; an F3 storm's winds are 158
to 206 miles an hour.)
</P>
<P>
   The chances that an F4 or F5 tornado ``will go over any
individual spot in a person's lifetime is on the order of 1 in 10
million, even in Tornado Alley,'' Gadomski said.
</P>
<P>
   The most destructive and lethal of the Oklahoma tornadoes on May
3 was an F5; such a storm destroys nearly everything in its path.
The May 3 twister was also long-lived, staying on the ground about
four hours. The known record is seven hours; most last only a few
minutes at best.

</P>
<P>
   The big challenge facing researchers is to learn to tell the
difference in tornadoes as far in advance as possible, so that more
precise and timely warnings can be issued. ``Right now,'' Wurman
said, ``we just say there's a tornado coming; we don't know whether
it's an F0 or an F5.''
</P>
<P>
   Improved predictions require better knowledge of the very
fine-scale interplay of temperature, moisture and wind that
converts a mesocyclone into a tornado. Experts like Wurman are
pursuing this knowledge using up-to-date technology to gather
real-world data, which are used to improve theoretical models that
are then expressed mathematically in the computerized models of the
atmosphere on which today's weather forecasters rely.
</P>
<P>
   One theoretical question is whether tornadoes develop from the
top of the thunderstorm down or from the ground up. This bears
importantly on the matter of how a more slowly rotating mesocyclone
increases its spin to tornadic speed. It was long assumed that the
tornado builds from the top down, but Wakimoto says there is ``a
mountain of evidence'' that many build from the ground up.
</P>
<P>
   In attempting to answer questions like this, tornado-chasing
researchers have used various technologies. One, called TOTO _ for
Totable Tornado Observatory, not Dorothy's dog from ``The Wizard of
Oz'' _ is an instrument package designed to be placed in a
tornado's path and sucked up by it. Some chasers also deploy squat
packages of sensors called turtles along roads. But tactics like
these, popularized in the movies, have limited utility, since it is
difficult to place the instrument packages properly.
</P>
<P>
   To zero in on tornado genesis, researchers concentrating on
Tornado Alley use two strategies introduced in the past five years,
said Dr. Harold Brooks, a research meteorologist at the National
Severe Storms Laboratory, a federal research installation in
Norman. In one, researchers chase thunderstorms and tornadoes in
fleets of cars and vans packed with instruments that measure things
like temperature, wind, air pressure and atmospheric moisture.
Readings are taken every six seconds in an attempt to build up a
fine-grained picture of tornado development.
</P>
<P>
   Wurman and his colleagues use the second strategy, chasing
storms and tornadoes in two flatbed trucks on which Doppler radars
are mounted. Like conventional radar, the Doppler version can
``see'' fine targets like raindrops and can tell how far away a
mesocyclone or tornado is. But it can also tell whether a tornado
is moving away from or toward the radar station.
</P>
<P>
   Stationary Doppler radar is widely used by weather forecasters.
But because the radar is often many miles away from the storm, its
beam is aimed too high. Doppler on Wheels, as the Norman program is
called, casts its beam into the storm much closer to the ground.
``It allows us to see details in the velocity structure we've never
seen,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   Doppler on Wheels also scans the atmosphere eight times faster
than the forecasters' radar, and when two Dopplers focus on the
same storm from different angles, a better picture of the storm's
structure and dynamics emerges.
</P>
<P>
   Wurman and his colleagues are on tornado standby from mid-April
to mid-June. So it was that on May 3, when the classic set of
Tornado Alley conditions materialized over southern Oklahoma, ``we
left the building fast,'' Wurman said.
</P>
<P>
   From 2 p.m. until after midnight, they chased supercell
thunderstorms and tornadoes across the state. They watched the
supercell that spawned the F5 killer that struck Oklahoma City spit
out one tornado after another. In two cases, the researchers
believe, the Dopplers captured tornadoes being formed _ including
the Oklahoma City monster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens very quickly,'' said Wurman, with rotating winds
escalating from perhaps 40 or 50 miles an hour to well over 100
miles an hour in two, three or four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's two more puzzle pieces,'' he said of the sightings of
tornado births. ``This will give us some answers.'' But a long road
lies ahead, not least in analyzing the mass of data that the
researchers are gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're reeling with the volume of data we've collected,''
Wurman said.
</P>
<P>
   How realistic is it to hope that tornado forecasts can
significantly improve? Predictions will never be perfect, it is
widely agreed. For one thing, the atmosphere has a chaotic, random
streak that frustrates precision and predictability. For another,
the short life of tornadoes inherently limits warning time; just
now it is measured in a few minutes. Some believe it might be able
to improve on that by 15 or 20 minutes. Optimists say an hour might
ultimately be possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the new technology we have,'' Wurman said, ``we are
positioned to make major strides. It really comes down to
persistence in chasing down tornadoes.''

immediate release or for weekend use.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LIFE AND DEATH IN IRAQ: A nation sagging under the weight of
sanctions &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Larry Johnson, foreign editor of The Seattle Post-Intelligencer,
accompanied by photographer Larry Johnson, recently spent two weeks
in Iraq to report on the effect U.N. sanctions have had on Iraq's
people, most notably its children.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and DeLong traveled with a delegation called Washington
Physicians for Social Responsibility. They returned with a
compelling story of how the fabric of family life has been torn as
children are forced to drop out of school and find work and how
thousands of malnourished children are dying every month because of
a lack of medicine and food.
</P>
<P>
   Also contributing to the package was Michael Paulson, the
Post-Intelligencer's Washington correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ (Baghdad) _ At Al Mansour Pediatric Hospital, malnourished
children lay on stained mattresses. The hospital is dark;
electrical power is cut periodically each day to conserve
resources. Moving from bed to bed, Dr. Tarig Al-Shujairi lists the
illnesses: typhoid fever, pneumonia, leukemia, tuberculosis,
cholera. A nurse runs by carrying a small bottle of oxygen. Nemya,
a blond 2-year-old with meningitis is unable to breathe through the
fluid clogging her bronchial tubes. Her father and mother stand at
the side of her bed while the nurse covers Nemya's face with the
small oxygen mask. It is too late. Nemya's chest heaves, her body
shakes, and she dies. Her mother pulls her scarf close about her
face and cries silently. Her father looks at a visitor and touches
his chest over his heart. A fifty-cent tube could have saved her
life, but the hospital has none. Impossible to obtain under the
sanctions, Al-Shujairi says. Such is life _ and death _ in Iraq
under the sanctions imposed by the United Nations in the wake of
the 1991 Gulf War. By Larry Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-VIGNETTES (Undated) _ Star-dash anecdotes on daily life in
Baghdad: a visit to an orphanage, at a wedding, an evening at the
tea house on the banks of the Tigris River (smoking flavored
tobacco from a water pipe), visiting a mosque during prayers, and a
military preparedness and training session for members of the
ruling Baath Party, including women. By Larry Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-FIXES (Washington) _ In Congress, the critics of sanctions
are pushing several pieces of legislation that would exempt food
and medicine from sanctions, or that would require congressional
approval and impose sunsets. From politicians to grass roots
activists, there are more and more calls to get rid of a program
that critics say does more harm to innocent people than achieves
its stated goals. With 1 picture. By Michael Paulson.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-SANCTIONS (Washington) _ Since the end of the Cold War, the
U.S. and the U.N. have increasingly resorted to embargoes and trade
restrictions as a way of attempting to force change in countries
whose policies they don't like. The breadth of sanctions is
staggering: 42 percent of the world's population now lives in
sanctioned countries. Now, sanctions are coming under assault by
the business community and from those who argue sanctions hurt
civilians, not political leaders. By Michael Paulson.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-DOCTORS (Undated) _ Capsules on the 22-member delegation to
Baghdad, which included doctors, a veteran, a peace activist, a
writer, an artist and a medical student.

<HEADLINE>
RETIREMENT CENTER CELEBRATES MASS FOR VICTIMS OF BUS CRASH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JERRY URBAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ As authorities Monday continued to investigate the
cause of a bus crash that killed more than 20 people, a Mass was
celebrated for eight of the female victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past 24 hours have been rough ones,'' Monsignor Thomas
Rodi told more than 100 people gathered at the Place Dubourg
Retirement Center in La Place, a community about 30 miles west of
New Orleans. ``Most of us would have liked to wake up thinking this
was a bad dream.''
</P>
<P>
   The eight women were residents of the retirement center. Two
other female residents remained hospitalized with serious injuries,
caused by the 9 a.m. Sunday wreck on Interstate 610 near Interstate
10 in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The tour bus, operated by Custom Bus Charter Co. of New Orleans,
was taking senior citizens to the Casino Magic casino in Biloxi,
Miss., after leaving La Place.
</P>
<P>
   There has been some confusion over how many people died. On
Sunday, officials said it was 23, but on Monday they said 22
fatalities had been confirmed. The coroner's office said 19 women
and three men died.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (the Mass) is a form of pleasure for us,'' said Jessie
Doyle, a resident of the retirement center. ``We're family. We're
all part of a family, very close.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle said the 110 women and nine men who remain at the center
are taking the deaths ``very hard, especially the ones who did not
go on the trip. We had six (residents) cancel because of Mother's
Day. They're feeling such guilt right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Also at the Mass was Rose Garnett, whose 84-year-old mother,
Florence Mathieu, died.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett said she was concerned about reports that the driver,
46-year-old Frank Bedell, of the bus has had medical problems
recently. ``If they (drivers) are feeling ill ... please don't get
on a highway,'' she said. ``My mama always taught us to be cautious
about driving.''
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans police and the National Transportation Safety Board
continued trying to determine what caused the bus to leave the
freeway and crash into an embankment at a tunnel for golf carts at
the City Park course.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Walker, safety director for the bus company, said the
driver told him the bus swerved when it was cut off by another car.
Police declined to comment about their investigation other than to
encourage potential witnesses to call authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-plus injured people included Bedell, who remained in
``very critical'' condition at Charity Hospital with pelvis and
head injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Francis, vice chairman of the NTSB, said during a press

   PARIS _ Henri-Francois de Breteuil was saddened, though hardly
surprised, when art thieves broke into his family seat, the Chateau
de Breteuil, in January last year. ``It was the fourth time in 10
years,'' the soft-spoken Marquis de Breteuil recalled. ``I was at
home every time. The alarm goes off at 3:30 a.m., you rush out, and
you see a truck leaving the plaza.''
</P>
<P>
   After each burglary, he improved the security system at the
elegant 17th-century castle 20 miles south of Paris. After the last
break-in, he even recovered one object, an ornate gilded
18th-century clock. It brought him little solace. With a spate of
thefts at chateaux and manor houses spreading alarm through
France's landed aristocracy, he can only wonder when he will next
be hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation has become truly dramatic since early 1998,''
said the Marquis, 55, who is also president of La Demeure
Historique, a private association of some 2,500 chateau owners, one
of whom has been robbed no fewer than 13 times. ``The number of
thefts has risen sharply. There has also been a marked escalation
in the quality of the objects taken.''
</P>
<P>
   With 18th- and 19th-century French antiques back in fashion in
wealthy homes around the world, robbing French chateaux has
suddenly become big business.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Gendarmerie, which polices the rural areas
where most chateaux are situated, the number of break-ins more than
doubled last year, rising 115 percent to 1,478, from 688 in 1997.
The Interior Ministry has slightly different figures: 1,266
burglaries of historic domaines in 1998, a rise of 152 percent. But
the agencies agree that thousands of art objects _ in the main,
furniture, antique arms, chandeliers, clocks and bronzes _ have
been stolen. And the crime wave is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Working through La Demeure Historique, chateau owners have
appealed to the Culture Ministry for technical and financial help
in better securing their homes, arguing that art thieves are
plundering France's national patrimony. At the same time the
Gendarmerie has created special investigative police units in badly
affected regions in the hope of breaking up ever more brazen gangs
of castle robbers and traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if the mood is one of frustration, it is because both
chateau owners and the police have concluded that their real enemy
is invisible. Burglars, crooked middlemen and unscrupulous dealers
may be the beneficiaries, but the root of the problem is the
surging international demand for French art objects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Castles are being targeted more and more because of the
quality of their art objects,'' said Jean-Michel Mimran, head of
France's bureau charged with combating the traffic in stolen art.
``And this seems to be in direct response to the popularity of the
18th- and 19th-century French style. Little of what is stolen stays
in France. What stays here is usually of little interest to serious
antiquarians and collectors.''
</P>
<P>
   Mimran said the United States, Britain, Germany and Japan were
the main markets for French art objects. ``Entire containers arrive
from transit countries, the objects are not identified as stolen,
and no one bothers to verify their origin,'' he said. ``Because the
market cannot meet demand, it often ignores signs of dubious
provenance.'' Some dealers even show photographs of French art
objects. ``In one gallery in Los Angeles, I was told it would take
three or four weeks to deliver some objects,'' Mimran said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, many chateau owners believe that foreign dealers can
``order'' a particular object in a particular castle on behalf of
an individual buyer, although Mimran doubts that the criminal chain
is that efficient. Rather, he said, traffickers respond to demand
for categories of objects. And at the moment French art objects are
in vogue. ``Britain has a very valuable heritage,'' he said, ``but
little is stolen there. Why not? Because there isn't great demand
for the English style.''
</P>
<P>
   Once stolen art objects have been distributed to dealers and
galleries in the United States or other markets, they are difficult
to trace. And once they are in private homes, they generally
disappear forever. Only occasionally are missing items recovered.
For instance, at a ceremony at the U.S. Embassy in Paris on March
22, the U.S. customs commissioner, Raymond Kelly, returned
religious artifacts stolen from a church in northern France and
seized at Newark Airport in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact there are ceremonies each time something is returned
shows just how little is actually caught,'' Mimran said. ``We work
closely with the American authorities, but even when stolen items
are found, the legal obstacles to recovering them are
considerable.''
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is the 1814 Treaty of Fontainebleau, the
international agreement under which Napoleon abdicated and went
into exile, albeit briefly, on the island of Elba. One example of
the signed document, which was stolen from France's National
Archives in 1988, was consigned for sale at Sotheby's in New York
in 1996. When Sotheby's contacted the French Archives as a possible
purchaser, it learned that the document had been stolen and
withdrew it from sale. Mimran said the man who tried to sell the
treaty had shared a home in Tennessee with the last person known to
have studied it in the National Archives. Nonetheless, France has
still to recover the document.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with thefts from French chateaux, however, is the
sheer volume of the art objects involved. Belgium and the
Netherlands play central roles as transit countries. With most
borders in the European Union now gone, truckloads of stolen goods
can reach, say, Brussels, Belgium, or Amsterdam, Netherlands,
within hours of a theft. (In southern France, some booty is
smuggled into Italy.)
</P>
<P>
   French police investigators say that middlemen based outside
France are the crucial figures in the racket: they have the
distribution contacts in the consumer countries, and they inform
art thieves of what objects are most in demand. Some stolen goods
are put up for sale locally _ the Marquis de Breteuil's stolen
clock, for instance, was recovered in the Netherlands _ but
containerloads of furniture, bronzes, clocks and the like are
shipped to more lucrative markets.
</P>
<P>
   In the hope of cutting the flow of stolen goods out of France,
the Gendarmerie has begun targeting middlemen in this country who
store art objects before they are moved on. Last November, for
instance, 2,000 objects, including 700 clocks, were seized in
hideouts in the Alliers region. Another roundup near Toulouse in
March resulted in 20 arrests and the recovery of a vast array of
goods stolen from chateaux in the region on 95 different occasions.
</P>
<P>
   But Lt. Col. Joel Vaillant, who coordinates the Gendarmerie's
campaign against art theft, remains pessimistic. ``We find less
than 10 percent of what is stolen,'' he said. ``We concentrate on
arresting the receivers of the stolen goods because each receiver
can have several thieves or gangs working for him. If we arrest a
single thief, he's out in no time. But if we can demonstrate that
organized crime is involved, the sanctions are heavier.''

PARIS: sanctions are heavier''

<P>
   What most disturbs chateau owners, however, is the recognition
that security forces are unable or unwilling to do anything to
protect their property. ``Their message is, we know things will be
stolen, but we can help you recover them,'' the Marquis de Breteuil
said glumly. Owners of chateaux that are open to the public, either
as businesses or simply on the annual Heritage Day, feel
particularly vulnerable. Thieves are free to look around for
anything that might be worth returning for.
</P>
<P>
   A few owners prefer to keep out the public, although as a result
they lose certain tax benefits. ``They try to keep a very low
profile,'' said an American woman whose French relatives own two
castles, and who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``They don't want
articles written about them; they don't want photographs published
in fancy magazines.'' Some even avoid taking out insurance on their
valuables, although in this case it is usually to hide their wealth
from the French tax authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Most have opted for tightening their security, though they are
all too aware that art thieves are sophisticated and work so
quickly that they can ignore alarm bells. All too often, they take
their trucks _ pushing them to avoid making noise _ to the doors
and windows of chateaux to load furniture or heavy bronzes. Since
the thieves usually know what they want, they can be in and out
within a few minutes even if alarms sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best solution is to keep the thieves as far away as
possible,'' the Marquis said, ``to have the alarms go off in the
grounds so guardians or families have time to react.''
</P>
<P>
   One way is to install sensors at the entrance to castle grounds;
another is to use large boulders to block smaller paths leading to
the main building. But in estates like the Chateau de Breteuil,
which is surrounded by 200 acres of woodland, it is almost
impossible to keep out strangers.
</P>
<P>
   The Marquis, who has recruited a retired general as security
adviser for La Demeure Historique, has recently reinforced the many
full-length windows and doors to his castle. For his most valuable
single object, the Teschen Table, an 18th-century Prussian pedestal
table with a top inlaid with 128 gems and semiprecious stones, he
has built a transparent security box modeled after the case that
protects ``Mona Lisa'' at the Louvre.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have good security, instead of losing three
clocks, the whole chateau will be emptied,'' the Marquis said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in meetings with members of La Demeure Historique, the
advice from security forces is to anticipate thefts by documenting,
marking and photographing vulnerable items to aid their recovery.
If a theft occurs, information can then be fed into a data bank
operated by Mimran's bureau, which now works in French, English and
Dutch.
</P>
<P>
   The best hope for chateau owners seems to be out of their hands:
that international demand for French art objects will suddenly
slacken. ``It's not impossible,'' Mimran said. ``For years, Italy
was in and France was out. These things come in cycles.
Fortunately, by definition, fashion changes.''

 &HT;    INDIFFERENT TO DIPLOMACY: REFUGEES SAY SERB PROMISES ARE HOLLOW

 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ As Yugoslav officials announced Monday that
Serb forces would begin a partial withdrawal from Kosovo, thousands
of refugees were completing their own withdrawal _ another forced
march to freedom by hungry and weary ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   About 20,000 refugees crossed into Albania in a three-day period
ending Monday night, fleeing shelling in villages near the western
cities of Pec and Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them brought fresh stories of atrocities by Serb troops
and vowed never to go back to their homes in Kosovo without the
protection of NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of pain they inflicted on my city, the level of
panic they created, is unbelievable,'' said Igjmet Rexhepi, 44, a
lawyer from the city of Mitrovica who fled Monday on foot into
Albania with his wife and three children. He claimed to have
witnessed the deaths of seven people last Friday when Serb
artillery slammed into the village of Zablac, where 5,000 ethnic
Albanians had taken refuge.
</P>
<P>
   Other refugees tearfully told of young men being separated from
their groups and taken away, followed by the sound of distant
gunfire. One woman told aid workers that a Serb paramilitary had
pointed his automatic rifle at the head of her baby to force the
family to move on.
</P>
<P>
   The grinding refugee crisis in Albania and Macedonia remains a
world apart from the diplomatic posturing and prospects emerging
from Washington, Belgrade and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Russia and the Group of Seven industrialized nations,
including the United States, reached a broad outline on the
conditions for a peaceful settlement of the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Upping the stakes in the diplomatic wrangling, the Yugoslav
government announced that it would pull some Serb forces out of
Kosovo as it declared victory in its efforts to root out the ragtag
Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA.
</P>
<P>
   But the refugees and the international officials struggling to
care for them, view with apprehension the Serb promises as well as
indications that NATO may be accelerating its efforts for a
diplomatic solution by watering down its initial demands of the
Yugoslav regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem isn't coming out. The problem is how do we get
back in? How do we go home? Will Clinton make it possible?'' said
Bekim Krasniqi, 25, a farmer from the Kosovo city of Prizren. He
fled one month ago and keeps a vigil at the Morina border crossing
in northern Albania for other family members he hopes will soon
come out.
</P>
<P>
   Seven weeks into the crisis, United Nations officials are still
struggling to cope with refugees coming in waves across the border.
More than 700,000 have left Kosovo - 400,000 of them through the
northern Albanian town of Kukes, where authorities are ill-equipped
to handle the load.
</P>
<P>
   In plans which seem to presume no swift return of the refugees
to their homes, officials are preparing to move large numbers of
the more than 100,000 in and around Kukes to new camps farther
south in Albania. From Macedonia, more and more refugees are being
flown to host countries, including the United States and European
nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply have problems taking care of them here,'' said Ray
Wilkinson, spokesman for UNHCR, the United Nations refugee agency
in Kukes. ``Refugees will be better cared for and protected in
other parts of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign Monday of growing tensions in Macedonia's overcrowded
tent cities, about 2,000 angry Kosovar Albanians protested poor
conditions at the Stenkovec I camp, which houses 23,000 people, and
alleged police harassment _ including the beating of two residents.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters chanted ``NATO, NATO'' in front of a Macedonian
police station, demanding that alliance troops take over the
facility just north of the capital, Skopje.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, UNHCR officials warned that the Macedonian tent
cities were ``on the verge of rioting'' because of overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   A nagging concern among aid workers here is that a military
escalation could result should diplomacy falter. That could bring
the war close to the border.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the refugee camps in the Kukes region are within range
of Serb artillery. Authorities here also worry that preparations to
use U.S. Apache attack helicopters to target Serb forces along the
border could provoke Serb retaliation against the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously with the refugees here it makes a more tempting
target,'' Wilkinson said.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer numbers in Kukes has overwhelmed aid agencies. While
NATO has donated trucks to cart the refugees south, only 4,000 to
5,000 are leaving the Kukes area, while thousands more are
arriving. Eight thousand refugees arrived each on Saturday and
Sunday, overflowing transit tents and forcing families with small
children to sleep in the open.
</P>
<P>
   Ilir Olloni, 35, was among the arrivals Monday with his wife
Lumnije and their two-year-old daughter Argyriana. The toddler, as
her parents, had not eaten in four days on the move after Serb
forces drove them from their hiding place in a village near
Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   The walked into Albania with the clothes they wore. The child
was pale and, her mother said, was running a high fever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs gave us no time to pack. They told us to move on.
But there was no where to go,'' said Olloni.
</P>
<P>
   The vague language agreed upon last week by Western nations and
Russia could leave open the possibility of a settlement that would
allow some Serb security forces to remain in Kosovo. The document
also did not explicitly state that any peacekeeping force in Kosovo
would be led by NATO, though U.S. officials continue to insist that
it must.
</P>
<P>
   It also calls for the disarming of the KLA, which largely has
been pushed out of Kosovo along with the refugees, and is now
seeking to regroup and train new recruits along the borders of
Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   A KLA military spokesman in Kukes said the movement would never
disarm. ``Each passing day we are getting better organized,'' said
spokesman Shefki Abdullahu. ``We will never give up our arms and we
will fight to the last soldier is dead if necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   But a refugee, Deli Qerreti, said only NATO could guarantee a
safe return.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we will get back and find our houses burned and our
lands destroyed. But we can rebuild. We want to rebuild. But it
cannot begin unless we are safe,'' he said.

VERN COUNTRYMAN, 81, RETIRED PROFESSOR AT HARVARD LAW SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vern Countryman, a retired professor at Harvard Law School who
was a specialist on commercial and bankruptcy law, died of heart
failure May 2 in Mt. Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   ``Professor Countryman reshaped commercial law in a more
complex, humane image,'' Harvard Law professor Elizabeth Warren
said Monday. ``He taught us that commercial law does not consist
merely of dry stuff, of codes and cost curves, but also involves
hard questions about the living, breathing human beings who infuse
the marketplace with opportunity and danger.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Roundup, Mont., Mr. Countryman graduated from the
University of Washington and its law school. He was an attorney for
the National Labor Relations Board in Seattle before becoming a
clerk for Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas in 1942 and
1943.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, he remained close friends with the justice and
wrote three books about him. He was an executor of the justice's
literary estate.
</P>
<P>
   After serving in the Army Air Corps during World War II, he was
an assistant attorney general for the State of Washington and an
assistant professor of law at Yale Law School.
</P>
<P>
   He was a dean of the University of New Mexico School of Law
before joining the faculty at Harvard Law in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   The coauthor of the texts ``The Lawyer in Modern Society,''
``Commercial Law,'' and ``Debtors' and Creditors' Rights,'' the
chain-smoking, crew-cut Mr. Countryman was considered a tough
taskmaster in the classroom. ``Stern Vern worked hard and believed
others should work hard,'' said his colleague Andrew Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his writing on bankruptcy law,'' said Kaufman, ``Vern was
for the little guys.''
</P>
<P>
   In an article published in The New York Times in 1982, Mr.
Countryman said, ``There's a great campaign on to convince the
press that the new bankruptcy laws are so enticing that people
can't keep out of the bankruptcy courts. But the real problem is
the economy. People just are getting into trouble, and changing the
bankruptcy laws isn't going to change anything. People don't pay
because they can't pay, and even if you change the law people still

YUGOSLAV ARMY, IN BID TO SPUR PEACE DEAL, ANNOUNCES PARTIAL
WITHDRAWAL 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The Yugoslav army announced Monday that
it had completed its operations against the insurgent Kosovo
Liberation Army and had begun a partial withdrawal of military and
police forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   An army statement said the withdrawal began at 10 p.m. Sunday,
but did not specify the numbers or types of troops being withdrawn.
Once an agreement is reached with the United Nations on ``an
international mission to Kosovo,'' the statement said, Yugoslavia
will reduce the number of its security forces to ``a peace-time
level.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, which led the state news programs, was widely
understood here as a gesture intended to accelerate negotiations on
a peaceful settlement on Kosovo that would bring an end to NATO's
widespread bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The partial withdrawal is intended to be ``one more positive
step forward'' toward a negotiated peace settlement, a senior
Yugoslav official, Goran Matic, said in an interview Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``But we cannot always make such steps without a
response.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials immediately said bombing would continue, and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called the announcement ``a
half measure.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbian officials had begun to say last week that some Yugoslav
army troops and police forces were being withdrawn from Kosovo at
the rate of about 100 to 150 a day. They said that the rebel force
had been largely destroyed and that there was no longer any reason
for huge numbers of police and army units, all of which needed to
be fed and cared for, to remain in Kosovo under NATO air attack.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Matic confirmed that a withdrawal had begun before this
announcement, but said, ``It will be intensified now.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Yugoslav government had decided to reduce its forces
in Kosovo to peacetime levels, ``but the intensity of the
withdrawals will depend on NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   About a month ago, around the time of the Orthodox Easter, the
Yugoslav government announced that all offensive operations were
over in Kosovo. That was clearly not the case, as the army and
police continued actions to break the organized structure of the
Kosovo Liberation Army and push remaining rebel fighters deeper
into the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, according to senior Serbian officials interviewed in
Kosovo, rebel fighters now operate in small bands, like partisans,
and remain active in the hills northwest of Podujevo, around
Bajgora; in the hills around Jezerce, near Stimlje, Dulje and Suva
Reka, and in the Kosare area, near Djakovica, where the rebels are
trying to establish a land corridor for infiltration from Albania.
</P>
<P>
   President Slobodan Milosevic has said Yugoslavia currently has
about 100,000 army and militarized police forces in Kosovo, up from
a peacetime level of some 11,000. According to the army statement
Monday, these levels would be sufficient to cope with ``individual
terrorist attacks by small groups of the disintegrated KLA.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO, however, says the number of Yugoslav forces now in Kosovo
is closer to 40,000. Washington insists that in any peace
settlement, the vast majority of Serbian security forces would have
to depart Kosovo, leaving probably no more than 2,000, some
officials say, and they would remain only until a new Kosovo police
force could be formed that would not answer to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, in her statement in Washington, repeated that NATO
would continue its bombing campaign until its five demands are
accepted. Those are an end to the violence against the ethnic
Albanians, a verifiable withdrawal of Serbian forces from the
province, the safe return of refugees, an international military
presence in Kosovo and the opening of discussions on the province's
political future.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said there must be ``demonstrable, verifiable
withdrawal of forces before we would even consider any kind of
suspension of the bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, NATO in its meetings with the Russians and other members
of the Group of Eight industrialized countries has softened its
earlier positions to come closer to Belgrade's demands. It has
accepted a U.N. mandate for the international security force and a
recognition of Serbian and Yugoslav sovereignty over Kosovo,
apparently dropping talk of turning the province into an
``international protectorate.''
</P>
<P>
   The main sticking points _ on which the Russian envoy, Viktor S.
Chernomyrdin, is working _ include the size and composition of that
international force, who will lead it and how it will be armed.
Chernomyrdin canceled a trip to Belgrade and went instead to
Beijing, where he is discussing his proposals with a Chinese
leadership that is infuriated over the NATO bombing of its embassy
in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has said he wants a U.N. force that would carry only
side-arms for self-defense and would not contain nationals of the
NATO countries now bombing Yugoslavia. He was described as ``very
firm in his position'' by Yasushi Akashi, a former U.N. envoy in
Bosnia, who met Milosevic over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yugoslav government is annoyed with Chernomyrdin, whom
they had expected here on Sunday, the anniversary of the end of
World War II in Europe. Yugoslavia was liberated by the Soviet
Union, and Chernomyrdin was supposed to honor the dead and lay a
wreath here, as well as talk to Milosevic about a peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Chernomyrdin returned to Moscow to have talks with U.S.
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott before going to China.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Monday's announcement by the army has all the indications of
having been planned for Chernomyrdin's visit on Sunday, as a
Yugoslav gesture to him and his search for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   When Chernomyrdin did not come, the state-run newspaper Politika
seemed to reflect official anger. ``It remains unclear what
prevented Chernomyrdin coming to Belgrade and why he first has to
talk to U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott in Moscow,''
Politika said.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin had said in Bonn that he had briefed Milosevic by
telephone about progress in drafting a settlement and was
encouraged by his reaction. But the Politika commentary did not
reflect that view.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Politika criticized Chernomyrdin, saying, ``The bombing
of the Chinese Embassy was in fact a reason for Chernomyrdin to
come and see for himself the crimes committed by the U.S.-led
NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbian officials have often been caustic about Russia, saying
privately that Moscow, despite its professions of support for
Belgrade, is largely doing Washington's bidding in the hopes of
gaining more financial aid from the West.

CNN HIRES HILL HOLLIDAY; FIDELITY HIRES IT SOME HELP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Hill Holliday Connors Cosmopulos was named Monday as
the ad agency of record for CNN, the cable TV news network, but one
of Hill Holliday's top clients, Fidelity Investments, also said it
has hired another agency to join Hill Holliday in advertising its
mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   The CNN account, which had previously been handled by CNN's
in-house ad agency, is expected to be worth between $20 million and
$25 million in annual billings, according to Hill Holliday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hill Holliday captured our brand essence in the review
process,'' said CNN vice chairman Steve Korn.
</P>
<P>
   ``CNN is a huge power brand with amazing growth opportunities
ahead,'' said June Blocklin, an executive vice president at Hill
Holliday. ``And it's an extremely exciting win for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Fidelity said it plans to add a new ad agency to a
roster that already includes Hill Holliday.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Fidelity's advertising had been shared by Fidelity's
in-house ad department and Hill Holliday.
</P>
<P>
   Now Gotham of New York becomes Fidelity's third ad agency,
charged with creating a campaign for Fidelity's retail brokerage
business, which includes on-line trading. Retail brokerage is one
of the fastest growing pieces of Fidelity's business.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, a ``Fidelity.com'' ad campaign was introduced
with the theme, ``Every second counts.''
</P>
<P>
   That campaign was developed jointly by Hill Holliday and
Fidelity's in-house agency. In the future, Gotham is expected to
become the lead agency on that portion of Fidelity's business.
</P>
<P>
   Hill Holliday developed a branding campaign for Fidelity that
stars Peter Lynch, who was once Fidelity's top stock picker. That
campaign will continue under Hill Holliday, a Fidelity spokeswoman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hill Holliday claims to be unaffected by Fidelity's decision,
though neither Fidelity nor Hill Holliday would disclose how much
Fidelity spends on advertising and how that amount would be divided
up among the various ad agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal has always been to help Fidelity grow their brand and
be profitable as a business,'' said Hill Holliday spokesman Eric
Fehrnstrom. ``We continue to do that as Fidelity's main agency of
record.''
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity advertising dollars spent at Hill Holliday and Gotham
ultimately could go to the same place. Both agencies are owned by
the Interpublic Group of Cos., which recently bought Mullen, an
agency based in Wenham.
</P>
<P>
   Hill Holliday, the second largest agency in New England,
reported billings last year of more than $700 million and revenues
of $106 million, a 33 percent increase. Big clients include John
Hancock Financial Services and Dunkin' Donuts.

JAPAN TURNS ITS LONELY EYES TO YOU, NOMO 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BOB PADECKY   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If it is true an athlete is more interesting
either on his way up or on his way down, then Hideo Nomo is a
five-part television miniseries, a Spielberg movie and a
book-of-the-month club selection. It's not every day people on two
continents intently watch an icon trying to hang onto his dream by
his fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is our Michael Jordan,'' said Kiyoshi Mio, a Japanese
sportswriter based in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Truth to tell, that doesn't even begin to approach the truth.
Michael Jordan never had to suffer the indignity of being released
by two teams within a month of each other, as Nomo experienced this
spring with the New York Mets and Chicago Cubs. Further, Jordan
never had a tryout in his sport and was told he stunk and that he
wasn't wanted, as Nomo was told by the Cleveland Indians a few
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very pleasant to be in major leagues again,'' said Nomo
on Sunday through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   As understatements go, this one carries the subtlety of a brick
falling 10 stories into a greenhouse. Nomo is euphoric,
overwhelmed, numbed, bathe-me-in-lilacs happy. Considering how
universally sour baseball teams are on Nomo _ and the sport is in
the midst of the age of lollipop pitching _ the right-hander has
checked the landscape and lowered his expectations.
</P>
<P>
   This spring Nomo said he signed with the Cubs because he wanted
to go to a World Series contender. Released three weeks later, Nomo
then said he would be happy to sign with anyone. Such finer points
can be made when your earned run average is the size of a large
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Brewers-Giants game Sunday, his first start of the
season, Nomo's ERA is 1.42. He lasted six and one-third innings.
Does this mean the magic is back? Does it mean he has his old
fastball? Does it mean the Brewers uncovered a diamond everyone
else thought was fool's gold?
</P>
<P>
   The answers to those three questions are no, no, no. Sorry to
say, unfortunately.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately because baseball needs Nomo more than Nomo needs
baseball. He is already Japan's Michael Jordan. His name will be
seen forever in the bright lights: the fastest pitcher in
major-league history to reach 500 strikeouts, only the seventh Los
Angeles Dodger to pitch a no-hitter, the proud possessor of
Nomomania, that drop-off-the-table split-finger and a delivery in
which he looks as if he is reaching to take something off the top
shelf of his closet.
</P>
<P>
   With so many faceless pitchers with interchangeable fat ERAs in
the game today, baseball could use Nomo's style, providing he has
the substance to back it up. That's the rub. Sunday, Nomo did show
some flashes, like that diving splitter he threw to Rich Aurilia in
the fifth inning in which the swing from the Giants shortstop
looked more like a tee shot in golf than a swing at a baseball. And
Aurilia is the sixth-best hitter in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not happy,'' Aurilia said.
</P>
<P>
   But more times than not, Nomo did not look like the 1995 NL
Rookie of the Year when he struck out more hitters than any rookie
in Dodger history. He was hittable, but he also was pitching
against the Giants in San Francisco, where he is now 4-0 with a
1.21 career ERA. The first fact was canceled out by the second
fact, one of those immutable laws of the baseball universe and a
development that did not calm the masses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half the people in Japan think he is done,'' Mio said, ``and
we are very worried.''
</P>
<P>
   They think Nomo has lost his crippling fastball. And he has.
They think he has a tough time throwing to the right spot. And he
does. Why, at 30 when he should be entering his prime, has Nomo
suddenly become ordinary? A nation is mystified. How did its
Michael Jordan stop flying?
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows,'' Mio said.
</P>
<P>
   So they hang on, just as the man himself does, by their
fingernails, hoping time isn't running out, settling for small
victories. After Nomo finished his postgame press conference, the
man from the Japanese Embassy who acted as his translator stopped
Nomo for his autograph.
</P>
<P>
   Without a smile, Hideo Nomo signed.

TIME FOR THE BRUINS TO GET TOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Time now for a character check. A huge character
check. The Bruins need more than a good start, more than a better
effort, more than doing all the little things in better and bigger
ways.
</P>
<P>
   What they need now, more than ever, more than anything, is for
one of their big forwards to (itals)arrive(unitals) Wednesday night
when they face the Sabres in Game 3 of their Eastern Conference
semifinal series.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for someone, like Jason Allison, to arrive the way
Bryan Trottier did for the Islanders in the early '80s.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for someone, like Joe Thornton, to arrive the way Mark
Messier did later in the '80s for the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins are going to live to play another round this
spring, they need big forwards with character, with certifiable
growl, to get them beyond Buffalo. It means taking command. It
means a (itals)coming out,(unitals) of sorts. It means being the
same thing on offense that Ray Bourque and Kyle McLaren are on
defense. It means playing valuable minutes, being asked to score,
and playing with the snarl and determination that Rob DiMaio brings
every shift to the checking line.
</P>
<P>
   It is as simple, yet as difficult, as that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't realize what it takes,'' coach Pat Burns said
Monday, less than 24 hours after watching an intense, almost rabid
Sabre squad shred his Bruins in Game 2, ``if you don't realize what
it means to continue. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Then you don't get it.
</P>
<P>
   Does someone in the Boston lineup get it? We find out Wednesday
night, and we find out Friday night in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   Does it all fall on the shoulders of Mssrs. Allison and
Thornton? No. But it's close.
</P>
<P>
   Anson Carter is another prime candidate. Three other forwards
who get bountiful ice time _ Steve Heinze, Sergei Samsonov, and
Dmitri Khristich _ certainly find themselves with the minutes and
the opportunity, but for a variety of reasons they don't fit the
profile. All can be valuable, but none is likely to develop
overnight as the key forward in charge, the man in command of the
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Trottier and Messier? Think about it. Trottier was 23 years old
in the spring of '80 when he evolved into the Islanders' key pivot,
his grit a key ingredient in their four consecutive Stanley Cups.
Messier also was 23 in '84 when he took charge of the Oilers'
superb talent _ taking on Trottier nose to nose in the '84 finals,
in fact _ and brought them their first Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton, who will be 20 in June, is considerably younger and in
only his second NHL season. But Allison will be 24 this month.
Carter will turn 25 next month. Are they too young? We think that
around here because, in part, Bourque is 38 years old, and by
contrast everyone else looks like an outsized kindergartener. But
the truth is, they're here and they're able, and there is no time
like the present.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them are young and they don't realize it, they have to
live it,'' said Burns. ``Some of them are perhaps saying, `I'm
young, I have a chance to do this later in my career.' Don't fool
yourself. Don't fool yourself with that. Because sometimes it can
only come by once, and while it comes by once, try to grab it, try
to jump on the train and don't miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 found the Sabres in full carpe diem mode. They stormed
the Bruins in the first period, dominating them with a fierce
forechecking game that barely allowed the Bruins to touch the puck.
The played, in captain Mike Peca's terms, ``like savage wolves.''
If not for the tidy work of Byron Dafoe in net, the Bruins could
have been trailing by a half-dozen goals after 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffalo attack dissipated slightly in the second period, but
the statement was made: The Sabres were stronger, faster, and far
feistier. The Bruins weren't pushing back, fighting for space,
displaying the same will to win. Bourque got flattened by a
menacing check from Alexei Zhitnik. That got the Bruins mad, but
even seeing their hallowed captain get pasted wasn't enough for
them to ratchet up their game.
</P>
<P>
   An incensed McLaren stood outside the penalty box and yakked at
Zhitnik. No fight ensued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zhitnik is not going to fight Kyle McLaren,'' said Burns. ``No
matter what happens, Alec Zhitnik is not going to challenge Kyle
McLaren in a duo. He'll hit Ray Bourque from behind, but he has
nothing to worry about, because nobody is going to get him. Nobody
is going to throw his gloves and go after him, because we stress
discipline and we stress emotion. We stress all these things that
you can't be.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if somebody would do that, he would be considered the most
idiotic person in the world if he did something stupid like that.
He probably would, you know, get torn apart (in the media). That's
the way it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   What would Burns think if someone did go after Zhitnik?
</P>
<P>
   Matter-of-factly, the coach said, ``I would think probably it's
a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   There is virtually no chance that this series will turn into a
donnybrook. Not now, not at 1-1. If the clinching game, be it Game
5, 6, or 7, is clearly determined with, say, 10 minutes to go, then
it could turn very ugly. Zhitnik, guaranteed, would face
retribution. It's a different game today, true, but it's still
hockey, and it's still Bourque, whose career began when pounds of
flesh were still legal tender for paying debts.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not what now is about.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the Sabres is taking a carbon copy of Sunday's game plan
and tracing over every X and O. They've got all they need to know.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the Bruins is finding the guy, the big shirt, a forward
who throws his weight around, charges down the middle with elbows
flying, and belts in a goal.
</P>
<P>
   So much to ask. But also obvious.

KHMER ROUGE'S INTERROGATOR TO BE QUESTIONED BY PROSECUTORS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ The chief interrogator for the Khmer Rouge
has been taken into custody and will soon be questioned by military
prosecutors, a Cambodian government spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The interrogator, Kang Kek Ieu, who is known as Duch, his
revolutionary nickname, was put under protective custody on Sunday
as a possible witness or defendant in the deaths of more than a
million people when the Khmer Rouge held power from 1975 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military court will invite him and ask him some
questions,'' said the spokesman, Om Yentieng. ``It is normal. It is
like a doctor interviewing a patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Duch was the commandant of Tuol Sleng prison in Phnom Penh,
where at least 14,000 people were tortured and killed. He was
discovered last month by foreign journalists, working anonymously
with international aid groups in a remote area of western Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   Duch, 56, told the journalists that he had converted to
Christianity, that he knew he had done wrong and that he was
willing to testify about his own actions and those of other Khmer
Rouge leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually we slit their throats,'' Duch said in a long interview
with Nate Thayer of The Far Eastern Economic Review, which is based
in Hong Kong. ``We killed them like chickens.''
</P>
<P>
   The first case in which he could appear is that of Ta Mok, a
Khmer Rouge military leader who was captured in March and is now
also in custody in Phnom Penh. Ta Mok is awaiting charges involving
the crimes of the 1970s, and it is not clear when his trial might
begin.
</P>
<P>
   A military investigating judge assigned to that case, Gen. Ngin
Sam An, said Duch could be a ``key witness'' in that and other
potential cases. But he said no charges or detention order for Duch
had yet been filed.
</P>
<P>
   In his statements to journalists, Duch also implicated other
Khmer Rouge leaders who have been allowed to surrender and live
peacefully not far from the area where he was working. These
include Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan and Ieng Sary, three of the most
senior architects of the Khmer Rouge rule.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia has been carefully
noncommittal about his plans for these men, making strong arguments
against bringing them to trial but at the same time repeating that
they had no guarantee of immunity or personal safety.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen appears to fear losing control of a volatile political
issue that could lead to widespread recriminations and possible
violence. But a diplomat said the unexpected emergence of Duch
could make it harder for the government to avoid bringing these top
leaders to trial.
</P>
<P>
   A broader question is whether any Khmer Rouge trial can be
conducted fairly in Cambodia, where the justice system is widely
viewed as corrupt and unprofessional.
</P>
<P>
   While insisting that any trial be held inside Cambodia _
contrary to advice from the United Nations _ Hun Sen has said he
would accept assistance from foreign experts. The U.N. envoy for
human rights in Cambodia, Thomas Hammarberg, arrived in Phnom Penh
on Monday to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Hammarberg said he was open to discussion but that there could
be no half-measures regarding standards of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are flexible on everything except the standards,'' he said.
``The standards must be perfect. They should meet the international
standards of justice and fairness.''

CLINTON SEEKS VOLUNTARY RESTRAINTS ON VIOLENCE BY ENTERTAINMENT
INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton urged the nation's entertainment
industry Monday to join a voluntary, grass-roots crusade to protect
children from violence in television programs, movies, music and
video games.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton issued the broad summons to action following more than
four hours of closed-door discussions with nearly 60 entertainment
industry representatives, gun manufacturers, law enforcement
specialists, school officials, religious leaders and members of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The president was joined by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton,
Vice President Al Gore and his wife Tipper Gore in outlining steps
designed to prevent any repetition of the school killings that
occurred April 20 in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that there is more for each of us to do at home and at
school, in Hollywood and in the heartland and here in Washington,''
Clinton declared in remarks in the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The participants included America Online chief executive Steve
Case; poet Maya Angelou; singer Gloria Estefan; the actor Andrew
Shue, former star of ``Melrose Place''; and executives from
gunmakers Smith &AMP; Wesson Corp., Glock Inc., and O.F. Mossberg &AMP;
Sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot pretend that there is no impact on our culture and
our children that is adverse if there is too much violence coming
out of what they see and experience,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Case added: ``Everybody recognizes that they're part of the
problem. They need to be part of the solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House conference followed the premeditated rampage
through Littleton's Columbine High School by two young men who
killed 12 fellow students and a teacher, and wounded more than 30
others before committing suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The killings at Columbine followed several school shootings
since 1997 that have claimed the lives of 29 students and teachers
and wounded more than 75 others.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, credited by the president with proposing the White
House conference, told the participants: ``I hope that everyone _
everyone in America _ will realize that there's a role for each of
us in trying to prevent youth violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The broad call to action included remedial measures throughout
society, from the federal government to the most intimate family
gatherings between parents and children.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations included: Greater parental involvement in
the lives of teen-agers; greater efforts to stem domestic violence;
greater investment in pre-school and after-school programs;
stronger ties between religious institutions and citizens' lives;
laws to make it more difficult for underage children to obtain
weapons; voluntary self-restraint by television executives, movie
directors and the music industry; and more teachers and counselors
in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials likened the crusade to earlier
moral-persuasion campaigns aimed at reducing the rate of teen-age
pregnancy and encouraging private industry to hire more than
400,000 welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government plans to create a nonprofit organization
to orchestrate an anti-violence effort that will include public
service advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ordered Surgeon General David Satcher to develop a
report on the causes of violence among young people that will be
delivered to the new organization _ the first such report in more
than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of
America, said his private conversations with Hollywood directors,
producers and executives since the Colorado mass killings appeared
to be yielding results.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meetings I've had so far, privately on the phone and in
person with the creative community, tell me that an increasing
number believe they can expunge from their films those elements
which they think are gratuitous _ which is defined as more than
enough,'' Valenti said after the White House conference. ``There's
not a code you can put on that because it has to be done individual
creator by individual creator _ that's as much as you can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Valenti cited the ``tenuous links'' between Hollywood
entertainment and the behavior of teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Valenti emphasized that the power of persuasion was all that was
available to reach 500 film production companies, 10,000 screen
directors, 85,000 actors and 27 film distribution companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all going to be volunteer,'' Valenti said. ``You can't
tell a director what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Valenti said he warned Clinton: ``I can't guarantee that after
all the exhortation that there are not going to be movies out there
that you don't like.''
</P>
<P>
   Estefan, a recording artist, said consumers can vote against
violence in entertainment with spontaneous boycotts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to buy the music,'' Estefan said. ``That's our
biggest control as consumers _ the money. Don't buy it and it's not
going to be made.''
</P>
<P>
   Estefan added that students ``also have to realize their
responsibility in not allowng people that feel like outcasts to
reach out to people that feel alienated that look different.''

</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., praised Clinton for
convening the gathering. Additional summits are needed to ``figure
out what's ailing our society and how we can correct it,'' said
Hastert, who did not take part in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that America Online, the huge Internet services
company, and the video game industry agreed at the meeting to close
a loophole that had allowed children to obtain violent video games
over the Internet that were not available to them in retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   The White House conference opened beneath a cloud of
controversy. The National Rifle Association complained that it was
not invited to the gathering. Wayne LaPierre, the NRA executive
vice president, accused the Clinton administration's inadequate
prosecution of criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you start prosecution, you're never going to cut to the
culture of violence,'' LaPierre said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer decried the
conference for being ``another federal feel-good forum _ lots of
talk and not much action.''

 &HT;    ANTI-VIOLENCE MEETING A 'FOUNDATION' FOR PROGRESS, CLINTON SAYS
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A White House ``strategy session'' Monday with
citizens, educators, and leaders of the media and gun industries
created ``a strong foundation (for) a national campaign to prevent
youth violence,'' President Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was exactly the kind of session I had hoped for, where
everyone was talking about the problems and the opportunities,
everyone was talking about what could be done to accept
responsibility,'' said Clinton, who called the closed-door meeting
in response to last month's school shootings in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one was pointing the finger of blame,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president and others among the five dozen participants said
the results will include:
</P>
<P>
   _ A new nonprofit organization to run the national anti-violence
education and advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   _ An update of the 1985 surgeon general's report on violence as
a public health problem.
</P>
<P>
   _ New alliances among organizations represented at the White
House session.
</P>
<P>
   Among participants who stopped on their way out of the White
House to talk to reporters, most said they felt a renewed
confidence in their own organization's approach to dampening
violence by and against teens.
</P>
<P>
   They included members of his administration and Congress,
students active in peer mediation, gun makers and a gun owner,
state and local officials, teachers, doctors, police, a judge,
clergy members, leaders of youth groups and foundations, and
leaders from the motion picture, broadcast television, cable
television, video game, Internet, music and advertising industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was most impressed with the surprising number of
people who said the ultimate burden is on the parents and local
community, and how all the rest of it has to be in support of
them,'' said actor Andrew Shue, whose Do Something Foundation works
to involve children in civic activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prevention, intervention and suppression all had support at
the meeting, which is fine with me, since I support all three,''
said the Rev. Eugene Rivers, a leader in Boston's successful
struggle against murders of young people by young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of thing can't be engineered top down by
government,'' Rivers said. ``It was helpful that the president
created a situation where the issue of the influence of the media
on violence could be discussed in a courteous and candid way, but
the real bottom line was the realization that success depends on
what parents and communities will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Case, chairman and chief executive officer of America
Online, the nation's largest Internet provider, said online
officials agreed at the session to work with Doug Lowenstein,
president of the trade group for video game makers, on a joint
approach to giving parents control over their children's access to
violent entertainment. Case and others are working on a new
``click-on'' parental guide for the opening page of portals on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Some interested parties, including top officers of the National
Rifle Association, couldn't get invited to the session around a
U-shaped table in the East Room of the White House. At a separate
news conference, the NRA officers criticized most of the
gun-control proposals recently announced by Clinton, and said
stronger enforcement of existing laws would be a more useful
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been the constant message of the NRA to enforce the
laws that are currently on the books,'' said one of the
participants, Minneapolis Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton. ``But I think
most of us think that's only one of the many things that must be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, the American Shooting Sports Council, which
represents more than 350 gun manufacturers and importers, endorsed
some of Clinton's gun-control initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Handgun Control founder Sarah Brady said, ``I want to commend
the gun manufacturers from coming to the table, and opening a
dialogue that's not been present in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the industry leaders, only those from the movie and music
businesses declined to offer specific new efforts to avoid
encouraging violence by or against youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try for my music to be a positive influence,'' said
Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan. But even music with
``negative'' influences can be useful to parents and society,
Estefan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important to listen to our children and listen to
things that attract them, because it shows us what their frame of
mind is like,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, meanwhile, Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., said they would go ahead with their push for
legislation to create a national commission to example the causes
of youth violence.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said congressional
Republicans still intend to hold their own hearings around the
country on the same topic.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday is scheduled to begin its debate on the
juvenile justice bill. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
has agreed to let gun control proponents propose some amendments to
that bill.

COMMENTARY: STEADY AS SHE GOES

<TEXT>
<P>
   Is everybody done now?
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Jackson, are you done making a fool of yourself, praying
together with the demented Serbian leader and mucking up American
policy by flying into Belgrade to get out three U.S. POWs _ as if
they should be our top priority now? Network and cable television,
have you shown us enough footage of the U.S. POWs, telling us about
each scratch they got and how they spent their days? Will you also
keep us posted when they sign their book contracts and announce
their Web sites? Chinese protesters, have you gotten it all out of
your systems, or would you like us to really set off a riot outside
the U.S. Embassy in Beijing by announcing no more visas to America
for Chinese?
</P>
<P>
   Can we get back to the war now?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, last weekend was a bad one in the Balkan wars, which is why
this week has to be the week for steady nerves. That this war and
its ramifications were so poorly thought out from the start by the
Clinton team is no longer in doubt. They will have to answer for
that later. But right now we still need to achieve our basic
objectives, and despite last week's fiascoes, NATO's limited-war
strategy is still the right one _ massed air power aimed at
crippling Serbia's infrastructure until it agrees to negotiate a
political settlement. And NATO's limited political objective is
still the right one _ a return of the Kosovar Albanian refugees
under some form of international protection. We do not have the
luxury of doing less, and we do not have the allies, the national
will or the national interest for doing more.
</P>
<P>
   That is why NATO and the Clintonites need to stay the course:
intensify the bombing, intensify the diplomacy. I am sorry about
the Chinese Embassy, but we have no reason to be defensive here. We
are at war with the Serbian nation, and anyone hanging around
Belgrade needs to understand that. This notion that we are only at
war with one bad guy, Slobodan Milosevic (who was popularly elected
three times), is ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blunt truth is that since NATO's bombings began, more
Serbs than ever support the regime's actions in Kosovo,'' Mark
Mazower, a Princeton University European expert, wrote in The
Washington Post. ``Hatred of Albanians is not something invented by
Milosevic; it has deep roots in Serbian political culture ... The
majority of Serb intellectuals are not liberals where Kosovo is
concerned. The prevailing popular mood is an intense, if
shortsighted, Serb nationalism _ resentful and narcissistic,
claiming victimhood for itself and indifferent to the sufferings of
the real victims of the past few months and years.''
</P>
<P>
   Such attitudes cannot be uprooted by simply invading Belgrade
and ousting Milosevic from power. Milosevic is deeply connected to
his own people, and too many of his own people are full of hate for
the Albanians, and vice versa. Trying to cure that hatred is a
fool's errand. The best we can do is bottle it up. That is why our
goal should remain bombing the Serbs until they agree to a
NATO-Russian force in Kosovo. If we can achieve such a deal, most
of the refugees should be able to return, and Yugoslavia would then
be boxed in on all sides by either strong states or the
international peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   And once that happens, Milosevic can stew in his own hatred. In
fact, I can think of no greater punishment for the Serb people for
what they have done, and what they have tacitly sanctioned, than
having to live with him forever.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to cure the Serbs' hate, and to temper their
nationalist fantasies, is for them to do it themselves. If this war
can be brought to a diplomatic solution soon, the Serbs, as they
rebuild all their broken bridges, roads and factories, may start to
ask: Was it worth it? Was it worth setting our country back a
generation so that the peacekeepers in Kosovo would wear U.N. blue
helmets and not NATO green ones? And who led us here?
</P>
<P>
   Only when they conclude that their nationalist fantasies have
brought them to a very dark and lonely corner will they change. The
Balkans don't need a new Serbian leader, they need a new Serbian
people that understands how to live in 21st-century Europe. NATO
can't produce that transformation. But by intensifying the bombing
and intensifying the diplomacy, it can create the conditions in
which that transformation might begin. Stay the course.

   LOS ANGELES _ Question: When we travel to trade shows for our
company, we are expected to share accommodations with other
employees of the company. Sometimes these accommodations are coed.
Is this proper etiquette for our company to expect the employees to
share and what should the guidelines be? C.M.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: This brings to mind an image of a management meeting
where some topsider says, ``Can we come up with an outrageous
policy that will upset the employees, invade their privacy and
maybe get sued?'' After a moment of silence, one manager in the
back of the room jumps up and says, ``I've got it! Coed rooms on
business trips!'' With resounding cheers and backslapping, the
meeting adjourns.
</P>
<P>
   As to whether it is proper etiquette to expect the employees to
share coed rooms, the answer is ``No!'' In addition, it is not a
proper policy, it is not proper ethics, and it is not proper
management. It is not proper, period. Management needs to be
advised of this fact and told that although they are interested in
cutting costs, there are tremendous costs associated with this
policy.
</P>
<P>
   As for some guidelines in this type of business situation, there
are companies that will place employees of the same sex in the same
hotel rooms. However, even in this type of scenario, the employees
are often given the opportunity to voice some preferences.
</P>
<P>
   Just because your company is sending you to a trade show does
not mean that you have to trade your privacy, values and sense of
what's right and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Q: One of our better sales reps showed up today wearing an
earring in his ear. He is the only male in the company with one,
and I don't think it's appropriate attire. We don't have a policy
on this, but we expect employees to show reasonable judgment in
this area. What should I say to him? T.A.
</P>
<P>
   A: Reasonable judgment cuts both ways, and before you question
his judgment, you should look at yours. In a word, is his earring
interfering with his effectiveness and productivity in sales? Or is
it just interfering with your image of what male sales reps in your
company should look like?
</P>
<P>
   There are many changes going on in the work force today, and you
are seeing one of them. There is a diversity at all levels of
countless organizations, there are casual dress days in firms that
a few years ago would have looked askance at anything other than
pinstripes, job security and employee loyalty are becoming
oxymorons, and there are males in virtually all occupations and
professions who wear an earring. Granted that just because many
employees are engaging in a specific behavior does not make it
acceptable, it is important to keep some perspective on this
matter.
</P>
<P>
   It is interesting to note that in some sales situations, many of
the male customers wear earrings, and the fact that your sales rep
wears one may actually help the sales process, as customers tend to
be more trusting of salespeople with whom they have some
similarities.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, if his sales decline, he will probably lose
the earring before you have a chance to say anything.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We are looking at several applicants for a bookkeeping
position, and one filled our application blank so thoroughly that
every single space has writing in it. She wrote so much that you
can hardly find the printing on the form. Is this the sign of a
potential problem? M.A.
</P>
<P>
   A: An employee who leaves absolutely nothing blank on an
application blank may point to potential problems, but may just as
easily point to potential solutions. An application blank is one
piece of data in the employment process. You can draw a few
hypotheses from her overly thorough approach, but you can draw no
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   In this regard, you can hypothesize that she is thorough, detail
minded and fairly compulsive, while some might add that her
response pattern also points to some underlying dependencies and
even a fear of failure. Either way, if her background appears to be
well-suited for the job, your next step is to interview her. After
all, thoroughness is obviously important in bookkeeping.
</P>
<P>
   Through a job-related interview that reviews her work history,
you will get a better understanding of this applicant and the
meaning of the way she handled your application blank. This may be
the type of person who takes 45 nonstop minutes to answer just one
question, and this can be a weakness. Or she may just be a thorough
person who takes every assignment very seriously, and this is a
strength. With a structured interview and some reference checks,
you are more likely to make a thoroughly effective hiring decision.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: SOME SEE DRAMATIC SUBTEXT IN TONY NOMINEES
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some say it signals a backlash against the British.
Others say there was simply a surfeit of good plays this season,
and those are the breaks. Still others are just scratching their
heads about why not one of David Hare's three plays _ ``Amy's
View,'' ``The Blue Room'' or ``Via Dolorosa'' _ was nominated for a
Tony Award.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work that he brought here this year deserves some
nomination,'' said James Freydberg, a Broadway producer. ``But this
has been a terrific play season, and sometimes wonderful things get
bypassed.''
</P>
<P>
   To Hare, who declined to be interviewed, the announcement of
Tony nominations last week apparently felt like a snub. ``He was
not consolable,'' said Roger Berlind, one of the producers who
brought ``Amy's View'' and ``The Blue Room'' from London. ``It hurt
a lot, and he's had experiences of this nature before.'' (Frank
Rich's negative review of Hare's ``Secret Rapture'' in The New York
Times in 1989 prompted him to threaten never to return to New
York.)
</P>
<P>
   This year's Hare shutout was particularly notable because, it is
generally agreed, Hare has been good for Broadway this season.
``The Blue Room'' proved the hottest ticket in town last fall, if
more for a glimpse of a nude Nicole Kidman than the drama itself,
generating welcome attention to Broadway theater. ``Amy's View,''
which is still running, brought the legendary British actress Judi
Dench back to the New York stage for the first time in 40 years.
And ``Via Dolorosa,'' the one-man play in which Hare appears
himself, was almost universally acclaimed by critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Hare has been a major contributor to the excitement on
Broadway this season,'' said Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the
Shubert Organization, co-producer of ``The Blue Room'' and ``Amy's
View.'' ``The idea that one playwright would have three original
plays is something you have to go into the history books to find.''
Schoenfeld called Hare's exclusion ``in league with great
oversights of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   As to whether the Tony nominators were sending a message to
British plays _ namely, ``Stay home'' _ Schoenfeld said: ``I would
imagine there are a number of Tony voters and nominators who may
have some predisposition about British theater people coming here.
I don't know of any other discipline where that exists, opera or
music or dance. It does in the theater, and it's an age-old
battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say Hare's exclusion had most to do with the strong season
for straight plays. The nominees for best play include Patrick
Marber's ``Closer,'' Tennessee Williams' ``Not About Nightingales''
and Warren Leight's ``Side Man.'' Marber, by the way, is British.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Hare is certainly one of the most prolific playwrights
on either side of the Atlantic, and it is somewhat surprising that,
given three popular productions, the nominators did not single him
out,'' said Jed Bernstein, executive director of the League of
American Theaters and Producers, which presents the Tony Awards
with the American Theater Wing. ``On the other hand, given the very
strong competition in the play category, it doesn't feel so much a
snub as an embarrassment of good choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Countering this rejection, the New York Drama Critics Circle
voted last week to give a special award to Hare for contributions
to the season. And on Sunday the Drama Desk Awards recognized Hare
for outstanding solo performance.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   NO FIREWORKS, REALLY
</P>
<P>
   Analyzing the Tony nominations is an annual rite on Broadway.
Because Tony awards can translate into crucial ticket sales _
particularly those for best play or best musical _ the Broadway
equivalent of Kremlinologists spend considerable energy trying to
figure out why the members of the nominating committee vote as they
do.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is made up of 28 people in the theater _ from
scenic designers to choreographers to playwrights _ who cast their
votes on May 2. But despite inevitable efforts to read between the
lines, people connected to ``that meeting'' say it was considerably
less intriguing than many suspect.
</P>
<P>
   There was no discussion of the merits of any production, no
lobbying (in contrast to the jockeying for eligibility in preceding
weeks), no effort at persuasion of any kind, they said. Boring as
it may sound, the members simply cast their sealed ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Because past meetings of the nomination committee were known to
drag on, Tony rules now limit discussion to a maximum of two hours.
</P>
<P>
   This year the committee members agreed at the outset to talk for
only an hour and wound up talking for about 15 minutes, mostly
about procedural questions. Some say several members of the
committee were frustrated by having to nominate four candidates for
best musical in a season widely considered weak in that area.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the meeting the nominators shared their views, as
they do every year, with members of the administration committee,
namely Bernstein of the league, a Broadway trade group; Roy Somlyo,
president of the American Theater Wing, which supports the theater,
and Isabelle Stevenson, chairwoman of the Theater Wing.
</P>
<P>
   Among their suggestions for the future were that the
administration committee find some way to pare the number of
performers eligible in the featured-actor rather than leading-actor
category, given that they had to decide among every cast member in
every play.
</P>
<P>
   They also requested a more realistic connection between actors'
billing and their actual contributions to a production. This year,
for example, Marian Seldes of ``Ring Round the Moon'' was nominated
for best performance by a leading actress, although she is onstage
far less than Elizabeth Franz, of ``Death of a Salesman,'' who was
nominated in the featured actress category, although she was billed
above the title.
</P>
<P>
   The producers of ``Salesman'' successfully sought to move Ms.
Franz from the leading-actress category to the featured category
because of the competition from Ms. Dench and Zoe Wanamaker of
``Electra.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee also suggested that musicals and plays not be
lumped together for scenic design, costumes and lighting.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, which began at 5 p.m., went past 10, mostly because
the nominators had to wait for the accountants to tally each vote.
When there was a tie _ and there were four this year _ the
nominators voted again, with one committee member sitting out each
time to ensure a majority.
</P>
<P>
   THAT LIVELY GHOST
</P>
<P>
   Despite some negative fallout from the resulting nominations,
there were those who celebrated, like the creators of the musical
``Parade,'' which with nine nominations received more than any
other production. The show, which recounted the 1915 lynching of
Leo Frank, a Jewish factory supervisor in Georgia, closed in
February after two months.
</P>
<P>
   Poetic justice? ``I feel terrific about it,'' said Harold
Prince, billed as the show's director and co-conceiver. ``I wish we
were running.''
</P>
<P>
   High-minded talk about artistic excellence notwithstanding, the
Tony Awards are considered a crucial marketing tool. As a result
there is some question as to whether the voters will want to give a
best-musical award to a show not in a position to reap the
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Prince said he hoped the voters considered more than the box
office. ``There has to be some attention paid to the future of
musical form and the next generation of composers and dealing with
unique subjects and not just falling into a pit of
predictability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prince said that if it were not for the financial travails of
Livent Inc., co-producer of ``Parade'' with Lincoln Center Theater,
the show would still be alive. Livent ``defaulted a really
substantial sum _ in not-for-profit theater terms, an enormous
sum,'' Prince said. ``And that's the sum that would have kept the
show running till now and would have paid for advertising.''

CHINA SAYS IT DOESN'T WANT BOSTON SYMPHONY TO PERFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i, a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The China Performing Arts Agency has officially
canceled the Boston Symphony Orchestra's scheduled concerts in
China Wednesday and Thursday. The agency took this action, it said,
in response to ``the barbarous atrocity of NATO'' in the bombing
Saturday of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   A fax received by BSO officials on tour in Japan Sunday stated
that the NATO bombing, which killed three people, ``has evoked the
utmost indignation of the Chinese government and people. As such we
believe the favorable atmosphere for the China tour at the moment
is no longer there, and no longer is it appropriate for the tour to
be conducted as originally scheduled.''
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra will return in two flights from Japan via Detroit
Tuesday. Music director Seiji Ozawa, who was born in China, will
travel to Beijing as scheduled to join his mother Sakora, 91, and
his brother who had already traveled to China; Ozawa still plans to
conduct his scheduled master class and rehearsal of Beethoven's
overture ``Leonore'' No. 3 in the Central Conservatory of Music
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   According to BSO managing director Mark Volpe, reached in Osaka
Monday, ``Our first information about the bombing in Belgrade was
sketchy, and monitoring the situation was quite difficult because
it was impossible to contact anyone in the American embassy in
Beijing. They were moving everyone out of there except for the
Marine guards.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night the designer Hanae Mori gave a reception for the
BSO and Ozawa in Tokyo, and the reception was attended by the
American ambassador to Japan and several deputies who were able to
supply home phone numbers for US embassy officials in Beijing, who
confirmed that the situation was serious, as did the BSO's contacts
in the US Information Agency. Later in the day, orchestra officials
received notice of the cancellation from the China Performing Arts
Agency, the government promoter.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's concert in Beijing was to be similar to the BSO's
outreach concert in Boston last month and to a program they played
on the Japan tour. The program was to be hosted by the leading
Chinese pop singer, Liu Huan, and attended by Prime Minister Zhu
Rongji and President Jiang Zemin. ``Certainly we are
disappointed,'' Volpe said, ``but we are also relieved that we are
not stepping into a troubled situation.''
</P>
<P>
   A statement from Ozawa read, ``I was born in China. One of the
proudest moments of my life was the Boston Symphony Orchestra's
trip to China in 1979. I have wanted to return to China with the
BSO for 20 years. I am terribly sad that we are not going back now.
I have decided to honor my commitment to give a master class in
Beijing, but obviously it's not the same without the BSO. I prefer
to think of this as a postponement, not a cancellation.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years have gone into planning the trip to Japan and China
to celebrate Ozawa's 25th anniversary as music director of the BSO.
Changing travel arrangements for the early return of the orchestra,
other people traveling along with the orchestra, and the cargo was
necessarily complicated, but at a post-concert party Sunday night,
orchestra members toasted the emergency skills of their travel
agent, California-based Tim Cole.

REPORT PUTS MEDICARE-HMO CRISIS IN NEW LIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CARL HULSE   
 New York Times Regional Newspapers   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When dozens of health maintenance organizations
abruptly abandoned Medicare last year and left 400,000
beneficiaries scrambling for coverage, the HMOs blamed federal
payment rates.
</P>
<P>
   But a new congressional study found that Medicare reimbursement
was only part of the problem and that competition, profit and
market conditions were significant factors as well.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the review by the General Accounting Office noted
that insurers continue to show strong interest in serving Medicare
beneficiaries via HMOs, signaling that the federal government may
yet be successful in expanding the availability of managed care to
older Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is premature to conclude that Medicare Plus Choice must be
radically revised to ensure the success of Medicare managed care,''
said the GAO study, referring to the name Congress gave the HMO
initiative created in 1997. The report suggested that the HMO
crisis of last year mainly reflected a shakeout in the
still-evolving health care market.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't seem like a simple market correction last fall
when HMOs began dropping patients around the country just as the
Health Care Financing Administration was launching its effort to
put more seniors into managed care programs.
</P>
<P>
   All told, 45 health plans dropped their Medicare contracts
outright and 54 others withdrew from selected counties, forcing
400,000 beneficiaries to find a new HMO or go back into traditional
fee-for-service Medicare. About 61,000 consumers had no choice but
to go back to standard Medicare since their counties were left with
no HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Many beneficiaries were not pleased with that prospect since the
HMOs offered extra benefits like prescription drug coverage and
eliminated the need to buy supplemental Medicare insurance. In
short, going back to Medicare meant higher out-of-pocket health
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional offices were deluged with complaints, Florida
officials launched a statewide investigation, and the health
insurers and federal health officials began trading accusations
over who was at fault.
</P>
<P>
   The insurers said federal attempts to cut Medicare spending in
the 1997 balanced budget plan had driven them out; federal health
authorities said the insurers were trying to squeeze out excess
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with the conflicting claims, Congress asked the GAO
to step in and investigate.
</P>
<P>
   In the resulting report, the GAO investigators said the
situation is not as grim as it first appeared since health insurers
continue to apply for the right to provide managed care. Ten plans
have been approved this year and 30 applications are pending,
including some for areas that do not now have managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If HCFA approves all of the pending plans and service area
expansions, slightly more beneficiaries will have access to a
managed care plan in 1999 than in 1998,'' said the report.
</P>
<P>
   As for the withdrawals, the review said they were due to several
factors, including payment level. While HMOs were more likely to
pull out of counties that had lower payments, they left counties
with high reimbursement rates as well.
</P>
<P>
   GAO investigators said a chief reason insurers pulled back ``may
have been the result of plans deciding that they were unable to
compete effectively in certain areas'' due to an inability to line
up a strong network of doctors, lack of experience in a community
or the presence of a larger competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials took issue with the report, insisting that
low reimbursement rates in some counties _ coupled with new
red-tape requirements instituted by HCFA _ made operating in some
areas impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shakeout thing doesn't fly with me,'' said Chip Kahn,
president of the Health Insurance Association of America. ``In some
cases, I think there just wasn't enough money there.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on past Medicare spending in a community, payment rates to
HMOs fluctuate by county from a low of $380 per enrollee to as high
as $694. HMOs continue to be more heavily concentrated in counties
with the higher rates and presently serve about 6.7 million
beneficiaries nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Federal health officials welcomed the report as vindication.
They argued repeatedly before Congress that the reimbursement
levels were sufficient and that HMOs were trying to shift
responsibility for leaving their customers in the lurch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agree with the report's major findings,'' said Nancy-Ann
Min DeParle, the Medicare chief, in a written statement. ``We are
committed to providing Medicare beneficiaries with the choices
envisioned by the Congress in this important, new program.''
</P>
<P>
   The real test may be yet to come. Insurance companies have until
July 1 to inform Medicare whether they will remain in the HMO
business, a deadline that will make it clear what direction the
managed care push is heading.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would still define what happened as a bump in the road,''
said Kahn about last year's pullouts. ``We will know in July or
next year whether the road will get bumpier or whether it was a
one- or two-year phenomenon.''

FIGHTING BUT NOT FIGHTING: STEP BY STEP IN THE BALKANS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   If you've been having trouble sorting out the arguments over
U.S. policy in the Balkans, ``Give War a Chance'' should help.
Although Tuesday night's somewhat gruesomely titled edition of
``Frontline'' oversimplifies matters by personifying policy
disputes, it illuminates the contrasting mind-sets of political and
military leaders on decisions that continue to perplex the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The two players under scrutiny here are Richard Holbrooke, the
U.S. envoy who led the administration team that shaped a Bosnian
peace accord, and Adm. Leighton Smith, who served as the NATO
commander in that troubled region. Their temperaments proved to be
incompatible as they tried to apply the very different lessons they
had drawn from the Vietnam War to the Serbian offensive in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who fought as a naval pilot in Vietnam, joined in
developing a new military creed that Gen. Colin Powell and others
in the Pentagon hoped would avoid Vietnam-like entanglements.
Tuesday night's narrator sums it up: ``The United States should
never commit forces unless our vital interest is at stake, and then
only with the clear intention of winning.'' Moreover, ``the
undertaking must have the support of the American people and
Congress and even then force should always be the last resort.''
</P>
<P>
   Such was the principle applied in driving Iraq out of Kuwait,
but the Balkans proved more complicated. Former Vietnam doves, now
in the administration, were turned into hawks by the accounts of
Serbian massacres in Bosnia and were dissatisfied with what they
saw as Pentagon foot-dragging.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent among those whom the program calls ``compassion
warriors engaged in a kind of moral imperialism'' was Holbrooke. He
tells Peter J. Boyer, Tuesday night's reporter, that when the
bombing began in Bosnia, he was ``a maximalist'' who pressed for as
much force as possible against Serbia and clashed repeatedly with
Pentagon ``minimalists, who wanted to do as little as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Holbrooke charges Smith with resisting his
demands that Serbian war criminals be pursued and arrested. The
admiral, who was later nudged into retirement, says that the
mission was impractical, that ``soldiers do not make good
policemen.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding Holbrooke, he says, ``He may be loud, and he may be
arrogant, in fact he is both, but he's not always right, and he is
not right about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although that dispute ended with Smith's departure, the issues
it raised still resonate in Yugoslavia and in Washington. With the
United States divided over the continued bombing of Serbia and the
possibility of committing ground troops, Boyer sums up this
revealing but unsettling hour: ``So America finds itself having to
fight a war with limited targets, with no ground troops, no
overwhelming force. Without the military creed.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Some promoters are already treating it as the next magic potion
for fighting obesity. And though orlistat, a diet pill approved for
sale in this country two weeks ago and marketed under the brand
name Xenical, is available only by prescription, it is being made
easily available. That worries many health specialists, who say the
drug might produce bad reactions or other problems if misused.
</P>
<P>
   A company based in the British Channel Islands called Direct
Response Marketing is selling Xenical over the Internet to just
about anybody who fills out an electronic form. ``This wonder pill
promises to be one of the defining drugs of the '90s along with
Prozac and Viagra,'' the company states on its World Wide Web site.
``Most overweight people harbor a sneaking suspicion that somewhere
there is a product that will solve all their weight-loss problems.
Well, now that product has arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators say that such marketing is legal in most
states if a doctor somewhere signs off on the prescription. They
are worried about such Internet sales pitches but are unsure
exactly what to do about them.
</P>
<P>
   A physician in Los Angeles who had nearly 900 patients on the
wildly popular mix of diet medication known as fen-phen before it
was pulled off the market in 1997 says Xenical may help bring some
of his customers back. The doctor, Ben Krentzman, who himself
weighs 400 pounds, says he believes the drug is harmless and he
sees no need to stick to the regulatory guidelines for who should
take it, though he adds that initially he will do so.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Tison, a psychiatrist in Sacramento, Calif., who devoted
his entire practice to fen-phen, buying it wholesale and dispensing
it to thousands of patients, said he had already written 60
prescriptions for Xenical and could not keep up with the demand.
``My appointment book is pretty full.''
</P>
<P>
   Such signs are pointing to an explosion in popularity like that
last seen in the fen-phen craze of the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The new drug does not work the way fen-phen did. Fen-phen was an
appetite suppressant; Xenical is the first anti-obesity medication
that blocks the body's absorption of dietary fat. And while
fenfluramine and its sister drug dexfenfluramine _ the ``fen'' in
fen-phen _ were recalled after studies showed they might cause
heart-valve defects, no evidence has emerged of dangerous side
effects associated with Xenical.
</P>
<P>
   But fen-phen and Xenical are alike in one crucial way: their
appeal as a potential quick fix for excess fat. More than half of
adult Americans are overweight, and many are desperate to shed
pounds. An estimated six million Americans took fenfluramine or
dexfenfluramine, bringing manufacturers tens of millions in profits
_ and Xenical is looking equally lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimate that the market could quickly grow to $3
billion a year, although the drug's limited effectiveness and
unpleasant side effects may make consumers move on to something
else. At least for now, however, ``this has the potential to be a
Viagra-type product in a different field,'' said Ira Loss, an
analyst with HSBC Securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as there is a lifelong search for the fountain of
youth,'' he said, ``there is a lifelong search for an easy way to
lose weight.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some health care professionals and advocates for the
obese worry that many Americans will start popping Xenical without
giving adequate consideration to the costs, benefits and side
effects. ``Misuse will happen for a couple of reasons,'' said Lynn
McAfee, a spokeswoman for the Council on Size and Weight
Discrimination. ``There is just so much money to be made out there
and so much desperation.''
</P>
<P>
   The costs come to about $4 or $5 a day, and insurers are
unlikely to pick up the tab. The benefits are limited; tests showed
patients lost 5 to 10 percent of their weight after taking Xenical
for a year in combination with a reduced-calorie diet.
</P>
<P>
   The most common side effects are bloating, flatulence and oily
stool, diarrhea and fecal incontinence, all of which the
manufacturer says can be minimized by reducing fat intake. But
Xenical also blocks absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E
and K, as well as beta-carotene, and so patients must take daily
vitamin supplements.
</P>
<P>
   The Council on Size and Weight Discrimination fears that some
users will not do that, and also worries that people with eating
disorders like bulimia, in which laxatives sometimes are used to
purge food from the system, might be attracted to Xenical.
</P>
<P>
   Health care experts fret about the potential risks of
prescribing the drug with other medications in combinations that
have neither been studied by the manufacturer nor approved by the
Food and Drug Administration. Already, Xenical is being called
xen-phen because some doctors have said they will use it with
phentermine, the still-available half of fen-phen, or with Merida,
a recently approved prescription appetite suppressant.
</P>
<P>
   Creating such drug cocktails could lead to adverse effects. ``I
don't like that, and I wouldn't do it,'' said Dr. Jules Hirsch, an
obesity expert at Rockefeller University in Manhattan who served on
the FDA advisory panel on Xenical. Hirsch said he voted against
approving the drug because of its limited effectiveness. The
public, Hirsch added, should ``remember combinations before that
have been particularly bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman-LaRoche Inc., the pill's manufacturer, says Xenical is
only meant to be used by the most seriously obese people who are
under a doctor's care. The company, based in Nutley, N.J., also
said Xenical should be used only as one component of a complete
weight-loss program. ``What we are providing now is a new tool to
be added to counseling, better nutrition and exercise that we hope
will allow people to better manage their disease for the long
run,'' said Patrick J. Zenner, president and chief executive of
Hoffman-LaRoche, a unit of Swiss-based Roche Holdings Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that many dispensers of the drug are already
treating it as a cure-all. And others say that with no known
serious side effects to the drug, there is little reason to worry.
</P>
<P>
   Take Krentzman, the 400-pound obesity expert who lost most of
his business after the fen-phen fiasco. He recently updated his Web
site to include his price for Xenical, and he says he may
eventually prescribe it to patients who do not fit the guidelines
set by the manufacturer and the FDA. Krentzman also said he was
considering prescribing Xenical in combination with other
medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``This drug works in the interior of the gut _ it never gets
into the bloodstream _ so what harm can it do to you?'' Krentzman
said. ``If it is none, what's the reason to restrict it?''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty, say health care experts, who note that the effects of
untested drug combinations are often not known until problems arise
later.

AIR CAMPAIGN IS SHORT ON LEGALITY, MORALITY, LOGIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE WILSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - A compelling letter arrived last week, one not meant
for a journalist's eyes. It was sent by a member of one of our
country's elite military units, who is stationed in the Balkans, to
a relative in Arizona, who passed it on to me.
</P>
<P>
   The soldier believes that our air attack against Serbia is
illegal, immoral and illogical. He didn't know his letter would be
given to a columnist, however, and publicizing it could have the
unhappy consequence of a court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   So I won't quote him. But since my Army service ended three
decades ago, I'll violate no regulations by quoting myself. His
views and mine happen to run parallel.
</P>
<P>
   The war is legally dubious because under international law, one
nation does not have a right to intervene militarily in the
internal affairs of another nation. The United Nations' charter
allows for exceptions, such as responding to crimes against
humanity, but the U.N. wasn't asked to legalize this war. If we're
willing to ignore international law to destroy Serbia, should we
expect other nations to behave differently?
</P>
<P>
   We're on shaky moral ground because most of the people our bombs
have killed or maimed aren't responsible for the crimes in Kosovo
we have sought to prevent.
</P>
<P>
   The moral question is addressed in Christian theology's ``just
war'' theory, developed by St. Augustine in the fifth century and
refined by St. Thomas Aquinas.
</P>
<P>
   The theory says for war to be morally defensible, it must have a
just cause, be declared by a legitimate authority, be a last
resort, have a good intention, allow for the protection of the
innocent and achieve more good than harm.
</P>
<P>
   How many civilians can NATO bombs kill before the attack loses
moral legitimacy? How much ``collateral damage'' can we tolerate in
the name of doing good?
</P>
<P>
   Our war strategy is illogical because the means we've chosen are
poorly suited to achieving our goals.
</P>
<P>
   We've tried to stop highly dispersed paramilitary units in
mountainous terrain with bombs dropped from 15,000 feet, and _
surprise! _ it doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   NATO wants to protect the Kosovars and punish those who violate
their human rights, but the attack has devastated Serbia to the
tune of more than $100 billion while barely affecting the purge of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Because their news media are government-controlled, most Serbs
know little about what their government has directed. They know
only that the Kosovo Liberation Army has waged a terrorism campaign
for years. They believe, and I agree, that some kind of military
response by Belgrade was justified. They've not been told the
response entailed atrocities and the expulsion of 700,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   If the Serbs could learn the truth, they would be less likely to
go along with Slobodan Milosevic. But instead of giving them
information, we've dropped bombs for seven weeks that have turned
them against America rather than their government.
</P>
<P>
   While we have degraded Serbia's ability to make war, we've also
flattened the country's economy and made life much tougher for
civilians. Our bombs have hurt average people more than the masked
murderers in the villages of Kosovo or the ruthless nationalists
ruling in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The argument against sending in ground troops is that it will
risk too many NATO lives. But if the war's ends are just, such
risks are part of the price.
</P>
<P>
   That's easy for me to say; neither I nor anyone in my family
would be putting a life on the line. It's less easy for a soldier
who would stand a good chance of being among the first assigned.
</P>
<P>
   That was the best part of his letter.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote about how much he misses his wife and young son. How he
hopes to teach him how to fly a kite and take apart alarm clocks.
How his heart's desire is to spend a long life with his family and
never see war.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he would rather be sent into Kosovo to try to save lives
than watch the air campaign kill more innocent people and pulverize
their country.
</P>
<P>
   I'm impressed that his military sense of duty doesn't obscure
his moral conscience.
</P>
<P>
   I hope he makes it home safely. His boy is nearly old enough to
fly his first kite. &QL;

 UNDATED: arise later. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In another practice that concerns some of the health care
experts, Direct Response Marketing, which is selling the drug on
the Internet, has few safeguards to verify exactly who its
customers are. The company requires what it calls a medical
consultation, which simply amounts to answering health-related
questions by computer, agreeing to the terms of a disclaimer and
plugging in a credit card number.
</P>
<P>
   One option on the online form, which the company says is
reviewed by its doctors, even allows customers to conceal the use
of the drug from their physicians. They simply click on a box
saying ``I do not want DRM to advise my doctor, and I take full
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Direct Response Marketing, which said it had already received
thousands of orders from customers in the United States, insisted
there was nothing wrong with its marketing tactics or its
customer-screening process. It also said it had turned away some
potential customers because of their responses to its questions.
</P>
<P>
   But just how does the company insure that it is not selling to a
16-year-old or someone with an eating disorder? ``That is something
we have no control over,'' said Tom O'Brien, managing director of
the company, who also said that most teen-agers do not have credit
cards. ``If someone really wants to lie, they can get hold of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission acknowledge that
they have been caught off guard by the surge in the sale of
prescription drugs on the Internet _ and cannot even agree which
agency has jurisdiction in regulating the trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has sort of taken us to a place and at a pace
that we've got to do some rethinking about the traditional
regulatory models,'' said Rich Cleland, senior staff attorney at
the FTC. The problem is compounded when the seller, the buyer and
the doctor who reviews ``medical consultations'' are in different
states or countries.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line? ``People going on line without a prescription
are taking a gamble,'' said Jeffery Shuren, a medical officer at
the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some physicians and weight-loss companies _
including the Weight Watchers International unit of H.J. Heinz Co.
and Jennie Craig Inc. _ decline to dispense fat-fighting
medications. Even so, the new drug's profit potential is too great
for some chains to ignore altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The Diet Workshop in Boston used to prescribe fen-phen at its
clinics, but said it had discontinued the drug approach. That is
not to say its employees turn away people who want Xenical or other
diet pills. They simply send them to Philemon Marvell, a local
doctor. It so happens that Marvell is one of Diet Workshop's
owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is part of Diet Workshop, so he is going to ask those
members to continue the behavior-modification program as well,''
said Jane Shannon, a sales supervisor at the company. Marvell and
other Diet Workshop officials did not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   The Council on Size and Weight Discrimination says that
weight-loss clinics should not be associated with diet pills at all
and that doctors who aggressively seek people who want Xenical or
other drugs are exploiting the public. Unfortunately, McAfee, the
council's spokesman, said: ``Xenical is not in Fort Knox with a
fence around it. Any doctor can whip out a prescription pad, write
it and people will buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman-LaRoche, which has 2,000 sales representatives marketing
Xenical to doctors, nutritionists and weight-loss centers, said it
was not promoting the drug as a panacea. ``This is not a magic
bullet,'' Zenner said.
</P>
<P>
   On that point, the company and the Council on Size and Weight
Discrimination agree. And it is all the more reason, McAfee said,
that consumers should not rush to take Xenical.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice to consumers,'' she said, ``is if they don't have a
desperate medical need, don't buy a diet drug or a new car in the
first model year.''

HOUSTON MAN BUYS SHOTGUN USED IN O.K. CORRAL BATTLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMIE STOCKWELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A Houston man purchased Doc Holliday's O.K.
Corral, 10-gauge, sawed-off double barreled shotgun last weekend
for $220,000, thousands more than what was expected.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Peavy, an appraiser with Attorney's Appraisal Associates
in Houston, purchased the shotgun, along with Annie Oakley's Smith
&AMP; Wesson silver engraved pistol for $37,000, U.S. Marshal Heck
Thomas' 1877 .38-caliber Colt Lightning for $42,000, and Thomas'
1877 .38-caliber Colt Sheriff's Model Lightning for $42,000, at the
24th Annual Firearm, Art, Western and Indian Relic Auction in
Pflugerville.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every gun was not purchased because it is a gun, but it was
purchased because of its historical value,'' Peavy said.
</P>
<P>
   The shotgun was used by Holliday at the battle in which
Holliday, Wyatt Earp and two of Earp's brothers faced off against
the Ike Clanton gang in 1881 in Tombstone, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Peavy purchased the guns and other artifacts for another Houston
man, who wishes to remain anonymous. The two men plan to open a
museum, though Peavy said he doesn't know when and where the museum
will open.
</P>
<P>
   But Peavy did say the museum would not be for commercial
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a place for the state of Texas,'' he said.
``We started our collection Sunday and will continue shopping.
We're acquiring the very best.''
</P>
<P>
   Peavy said he and his partner plan to shop at more auctions,
hoping to build an admirable collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``This won't be just another gun or artifact museum, but a
museum of important identifiable items from famous Indians, lawmen
and outlaws,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Keilman of Tom Keilman &AMP; Son Auctioneers, which conducted
the auction, said the 1,500 items auctioned over a three-day period
brought a little more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The previous owner of the huge collection, David Hall of
Illinois, said he will use the money for his retirement and to buy
more historical artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, an author and historian, recently announced his retirement
and the immediate sale of his old West artifacts after 62 years of
collecting. Keilman said Hall contacted him four months ago, eager
to sell his collection of antique weapons, photographs, law
enforcement badges and historical documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an auction of a lifetime,'' Keilman said. ``We sell
history and we sold a lot of it this weekend.''

FORMER SPEAKER'S WASHINGTON KEEPSAKES CAN REMAIN IN TEXAS FOR NOW
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A custody fight over an ancient Grecian urn, which
pitted Congress against a small-town Texas museum, is nearing an
end, and it looks like the urn is staying in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,500-year-old urn, valued at nearly $3 million, is one of
the most notable items in a long list of furniture and other
artifacts that were removed from the Capitol by former House
speakers when Democrats controlled the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Republicans took over in 1995, the House
Administration Committee launched an effort to track down and
reclaim the missing property. The disputed items included former
Speaker Jim Wright's office furnishings, now on display at Texas
Christian University in Fort Worth.

   Although Wright assured the House that he was willing part with
a couch, a display case, a credenza and a small table, officials at
the Sam Rayburn Library and Museum in Bonham, Texas, in North Texas
contested Congress' claim to the urn and other items in its
collection.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's showcase display includes the original marble
speaker's rostrum, a crystal chandelier from the Capitol and a
fireplace mantel that came to the Capitol from the White House.
Rayburn began shipping the items to Texas a few years before his
retirement in 1961 after nearly two decades in the top House job.
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials contend that the urn was Rayburn's personal
property because it was a gift from the government of Greece. The
former speaker snared the historic rostrum when the chamber was
remodeled during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   In a compromise engineered by Rep. Kay Granger, R-Texas, House
leaders have agreed to let the disputed items stay where they are
as long as they are available for public viewing. Granger convinced
Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois that the public would be better
served by keeping the items on display at various locations around
the country than by returning them to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Hastert, Granger said Rayburn's display is ``very
important for the thousands of families from Texas and around the
United States who come to Bonham to learn about American history.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would also apply to relics that were removed by
former Speaker Tom Foley, who now serves as ambassador to Japan,
and to the collections of deceased Speakers Thomas P. ``Tip''
O'Neill of Massachusetts, Carl Albert of Oklahoma and John
McCormack of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as it's on public display, such as Rayburn's stuff is,
it should work out,'' said John Feehery, Hastert's spokesman.
``We're still working on guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   Feehery said House officials hope to come up with a final
agreement this week that would resolve the dispute with the former
speakers and clarify the rules for Hastert and future speakers.
Former Speaker Newt Gingrich, who resigned last year, did not take
his office furniture with him, an aide said.
</P>
<P>
   A Wright aide and the director of Rayburn's museum said they
were waiting for official word on the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, they'll work it all out,'' museum director H.G.
Dulaney said. ``Surely, after 41 years, they won't be coming down
here.''

NETANYAHU'S SPENDING PLAN HELPS POLITICS BUT NOT ECONOMICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ One week before the May 17 election, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu is scoring political points but dismaying budget
officials with new spending plans for roads and Jewish housing in
Arab-dominated eastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The announced new spending plans have came as economists here
predicted that slower than expected growth would cut deeply into
tax revenues and further increase both unemployment and the budget
deficit this year.
</P>
<P>
   Over the objections of his finance minister, Netanyahu persuaded
his Cabinet on Sunday to approve a potentially costly program of
$5,000 cash grants for Israeli home-buyers in the state-subsidized
``new neighborhoods'' of annexed East Jerusalem. He also secured
Cabinet support for a $100 million grant to the city government for
``infrastructural improvements'' in eastern Jerusalem over five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's opponents in the Labor Party filed a formal
complaint denouncing the Jerusalem spending plans as ``election
bribery'' and noting that there are no surplus funds to pay for the
programs. And Netanyahu's budget advisers were equally outspoken in
their complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Meir Sheetrit, appointed three months ago as the government's
fourth finance minister in two and half years, joined his
ministry's senior civil servants in protesting that the programs
would bloat a deficit that is already exceeding its targeted limit
of 2 percent of gross domestic product. Finance officials, noting
that the plans are not in the recently approved 1999 budget, have
expressed concern about the impact of unfinanced programs on
already skittish local financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   As is usual with closed-door Israeli Cabinet sessions, local
press reports gave blow-by-blow, quote-by-quote accounts of the
acrimonious and theoretically confidential proceedings. Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon and other hard-liners reportedly accused the
budget staff of having ``political motives'' for their objections.
Mayor Ehud Olmert of Jerusalem, a chief beneficiary of the programs
and an expected challenger for the Likud Party leadership should
Netanyahu fail to win re-election, accused finance officials of
``abusing their positions as civil servants.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheetrit said Monday he still opposed the East Jerusalem housing
subsidies, but blasted subordinates for voicing complaints to the
press. ``I confined my objections and my protest to the Cabinet
session,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu told reporters as he left Sunday's meeting, ``Finance
ministers never want to give out money _ that's usual.''
</P>
<P>
   But there may be no money left to give out, economists here
warn. Tax receipts for the year's first quarter were down 7 percent
from last year's revenue, and newly revised forecasts for 1999 have
only made budget officials gloomier.
</P>
<P>
   Economic growth is expected to slow to 1.5 percent, down from an
already anemic 2.2 percent in 1998, according to Bank Hapoalim, a
leading commercial bank. Export income is sinking, with no
offsetting foreign investment, swelling the current account deficit
from $2.3 billion last year to a projected $3 billion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But the most crucial economic number in this campaign is the
unemployment rate. At 8.7 percent, it is already at its highest
level in a generation. And it will rise to 9 percent later this
year, the bank's economic department predicted, regardless of which
party takes power in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our economic forecast for 1999 assumes that it will only be
possible to prevent negative trends from worsening,'' the Bank
Hapoalim report said, so there would be no quick turnaround. The
Labor Party, unsurprisingly disagreeing, promises to embark
immediately on a program to create 300,000 new jobs in four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is not just the amount of the deficit, but how
they cut the cake,'' said Dov Lautman, the chairman of Delta Galil
Industries and one of Labor's leading business supporters. ``Monies
are going in the wrong direction, in my opinion. They should be
going to job creation, to infrastructure, and education.''
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, the focus of the Netanyahu government's new
spending plans, unemployment is below the national average,
hovering around 7 percent. The most severe joblessness _ averaging
10 percent and higher _ is found in the new so-called development
towns of the southern and eastern deserts, populated by the recent
Russian immigrants and working-class Sephardic Jews who have been
Likud's core constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Labor strategists hope Netanyahu's emphasis on Jerusalem as
economic duress elsewhere increases will help them make inroads
into those communities. But some experts are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a treasury minister resists the prime minister just a
week before the election, it is an indication of how many problems
Netanyahu has with his own government,'' said Ira Sharkansky, a
Hebrew University specialist in the political economy of Israel.
``But I don't think economic performance is the weakest link in
Likud's world: The poor vote for Likud, and yuppies and big
business leaders vote for Labor. It's a peculiar combination.''

much like a spin-off, except that the assets are not actually spun

Y2K HOTELS (Phoenix) - Father time wears a Rolex this New Year's

CENTER PARTY CANDIDATE REFUSES TO BOW OUT OF PRIME MINISTER'S RACE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Yitzhak Mordechai, the Center Party candidate for
prime minister who blazed onto the Israeli political scene, is
fading in the polls but refusing to bow out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Polls that once showed him garnering support from one in five
voters _ high for a first-time candidate _ now give him less than
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The plummet in popularity has put him under pressure to pull out
and throw his political weight behind Ehud Barak, the opposition
Labor Party candidate who is running as the head of a coalition
called One Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But with only eight days left before the elections take place
May 17, Mordechai has said he is in the race for the duration.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's staying in the race,'' said Menashe Raz, spokesman for
Mordechai. ``He believes that he has to keep his promise to his
voters and to keep the party together.''
</P>
<P>
   An immensely popular former defense minister sacked by Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last winter, Mordechai's stated goal
when he joined three other disgruntled Likud Party members to form
the Center Party was to bring Netanyahu down.
</P>
<P>
   His election campaign, full of swipes at Netanyahu, was geared
to steal votes away from the prime minister's center-right
constituents. Political pundits predicted early on that he would
eventually pull out of the race and call on his followers to vote
for Barak.
</P>
<P>
   By last week, when polls started showing Mordechai's popularity
had sunk to between 5 and 7 percent, the former military man
stubbornly held on.
</P>
<P>
   An advertisement in Sunday's Hebrew daily Ma'ariv, paid for by
an organization calling itself People Who Care About the Country's
Future, called on Barak and Mordechai to join forces ``for peace,
for economy, for security ... for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Yossi Beilin, a leading Labor Party member, wrote in
a local newspaper that ``it would be much more respectable for
Mordechai to join forces with the camp which will replace Netanyahu
than trying to prove to Netanyahu what a man he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of pulling out, Mordechai has attacked the polls as
``biased.'' His party has dropped the slogan ``Only Mordechai can
beat Bibi big.'' Polls found 71 percent of Israelis had disagreed
with the phrase.
</P>
<P>
   The big question now is whether Mordechai's decision to continue
to run will do more harm than good to Barak's election chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the Mordechai voters are disgruntled Netanyahu
voters,'' said Reuven Hazan, a political analyst at Jerusalem's
Hebrew University. ``If they all go home (to Likud), then by him
pulling out of the race, he'll hurt Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``If those voters make the leap and vote for Barak, then by
pulling out, he'll hurt Netanyahu,'' Hazan said.
</P>
<P>
   Polls taken last week found the Labor Party candidate leading
Netanyahu by eight percentage points _ 43 percent to 35 percent _
with Mordechai in the race. Without Mordechai, those same polls
showed support for Barak rising to 50 percent _ almost the minimum
needed to prevent a run-off.
</P>
<P>
   If no candidate gets a simple majority of the votes _ 50 percent
plus one vote _ Israel will hold a second round of elections June
1.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's rise in the polls reflects a wide base of support. A
party of religious moderates and one of Jews from Arab countries
have joined his Labor Party, traditionally made up of Ashkenazi
Jewish elites, to form the One Israel ticket. He also has increased
support among new immigrants from the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said Netanyahu has an interest in seeing Mordechai
stay in the race. Already, some of his campaign ads have focused on
calling on Netanyahu voters who have gone over to Mordechai to come
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Netanyahu succeeds in preventing Labor from winning in the
first round, it will energize many of his people,'' said Efraim
Inbar, a political analyst at the Besa Center for Strategic Studies
at Bar Ilan University. ``At least this will give his people a
second chance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Inbar said Mordechai, a career army officer appointed to all
three Israeli regional commands, may be motivated in part by an
unwillingness to accept defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took on a mission, and he's going on until the end,'' Inbar
said. ``He doesn't want to admit failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak, he said, hasn't made it easy for Mordechai to come over
to the Labor camp. Instead, he has humiliated Mordechai by telling
him he has no chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   If Mordechai pulls out now, Center Party members fear the party
will suffer. And many believe that Barak will do better in a second
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling is that the party can fall apart if (Mordechai)
pulls out of the race now,'' said Mordechai's spokesman Raz.
``Netanyahu's voters from 1996 who will vote for Mordechai in the
first round will find it easier to vote for Barak on the second
round.''

BEIJING PROTESTS HAVE MADE U.S. AMBASSADOR A PRISONER IN HIS OWN
EMBASSY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-CHINA, KOSOVO-CHINA-TRADE) 
(nk) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ For the last three years, Ambassador James Sasser has
toiled to build relations between China and the United States, an
unflagging optimist about the potential for two such different
countries to be friends.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three days, he has been a virtual prisoner in his
embassy office building, surrounded by angry protesters just
outside the gates, many of them hurling rocks, eggs and tomatoes
and calling for vengeance for the NATO bombing early Saturday of
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   When the protesters arrived Saturday afternoon, he was working
in his office. Since then, he has not changed his clothes or
showered. He has been eating freeze-dried military rations and
sleeping without blankets on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I can leave safely,'' he said Monday, in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   And, although Chinese officials have assured him that he and
other foreigners would be safe, he added: ``I'm not sure they fully
appreciate what's happening on the ground in front of our
embassy.''
</P>
<P>
   The low point of the ordeal, he said, came on Sunday morning
when he and other employees began destroying sensitive documents in
preparation for abandoning the building, fearing that raging
protesters were about to overwhelm the double row of police
officers and stream through the gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd was pushing the police back _ they looked tired _
and these young police were frantically calling for
reinforcements,'' Sasser said. ``We thought the odds were 50-50
they were coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Several hours later he got a call from his wife, who was
similarly stuck a couple of blocks away in the ambassador's
residence, with their 30-year-old son, Gray, and four house guests
from Houston. Protesters who had been throwing rocks from the
residence's distant front gate had discovered that the house was
just feet from an unguarded side wall, and had started lobbing
concrete chunks into the dining room.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night protesters threw two gasoline bombs through the
embassy's broken windows, igniting fires that marine guards put out
with extinguishers.
</P>
<P>
   Sasser said he had little success reaching Chinese officials to
complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disturbing thing is that Saturday and Sunday we couldn't
get any high-level Chinese and were just talking to on-duty
officers at the Foreign Ministry,'' he said. ``Finally in utter
frustration I called Li Zhaoxing, the Chinese ambassador to
Washington, and got him out of bed at 3:30 in the morning, to ask
him to help.`
</P>
<P>
   Sasser said the protests at the embassy office building Monday
seemed somewhat less intense, although on occasion rocks and chunks
of concrete poured down like rain.
</P>
<P>
   At dawn Monday Mrs. Sasser escaped from the residence compound,
after someone called from a cell phone to say that the protesters,
who thin out considerably at night, had withdrawn. She grabbed her
dog, Lucky, and his insulin. Then she and the others simply walked
out of the compound to a nearby apartment complex for foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``You sit in the dark and you hear this endless crashing and you
don't know how long it's going to last,'' said Mrs. Sasser. ``We
were scared for our lives, but I was also really hurt since Jim and
I have worked so hard here.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said there was a chance Sasser would be able to leave
the embassy on Tuesday, but for now there are also two political
officers, eight Marines and two security officers there.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The water is working, Sasser said, and so are the electricity
and phone lines, allowing him to maintain contact with Washington.
But, he said, ``we have no blankets, no beds, no pillows, no
showers _ other than that we're doing fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every window on the street side of the building had
been shattered, and shards of glass and chunks of concrete littered
the floors.
</P>
<P>
   The destruction underscores the vulnerability of the embassy, a
hodgepodge of older buildings at two different locations in
Beijing's embassy district; the buildings were bought after the two
countries re-established diplomatic relations in 1979. The office
building where Sasser is trapped is set back only about 20 feet
from the street and was once a Pakistani school.
</P>
<P>
   ``This embassy clearly does not meet the requirements of the
Inman Commission, such as a 100-foot setback,'' Sasser said,
referring to security standards recommended in 1985 by a panel led
by retired Adm. Bobby R. Inman. ``That's why they can get us and
throw in these chunks of concrete and firebombs. So it is hard for
the police to control things.''
</P>
<P>
   Sasser, a former senator, said that he had lobbied congressional
colleagues for money to demolish the buildings and build new ones,
but that the money set aside for this ``got diverted for other
uses'' last year after the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania
were bombed.
</P>
<P>
   So Sasser spent Saturday and Sunday nights eating things like
freeze-dried beef stew and sleeping on the floor, to the sound of
breaking glass and chants like ``Hang Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   But Monday afternoon, he said, things were looking up, in part
because British diplomats had managed to send sleeping bags into
the compound, presumably by tossing them over the walls that
separate neighboring diplomatic compounds.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For a man who had spent the previous three days as the target of
rocks and tomatoes, Sasser remained remarkably upbeat about China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gone through stages on how I feel about all this,'' he
said. ``First there was frustration and anger. But now I realize
that what we're seeing is a venting, and once the emotion is
drained away, the overriding importance of establishing a mature
and stable relationship will re-emerge.''

   KOSOVO-DIPLO (Washington) _ Ledeall: Buffeted by a bombing error
that, from a diplomatic point of view, could hardly have been
worse, the administration had little choice but to insist today
that it was persisting with its dual Kosovo policy of hard bombing
and fast talk. To make the situation even more delicate, the
Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic, tried to tantalize the
administration by announcing a partial withdrawal of his military
forces from Kosovo. Other developments. By Jane Perlez.

police officers to within 25 feet of the embassy. Many chanted
``Down with American imperialism!'' and sang the Chinese national
anthem. By Erik Eckholm.

TEXAS LAWMAKER `TAKEN ABACK' BY BRADLEY'S PRESSURE TACTICS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional ending) 
 
By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ State Sen. Florence Shapiro, one of four
Republican holdouts keeping the hate crimes billed mired in
committee, said Monday she resents pressure tactics by a Democratic
presidential contender to get her to vote for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro of Plano said she got a call last week from Bill
Bradley, a former U.S. senator from New Jersey and the only
announced contender to Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic
nomination to succeed Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was taken aback,'' said Shapiro, who has never met Bradley.
``I thought it was a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   After he complimented her on the work she has done in the Texas
Senate, Shapiro said Bradley then told her, ``I know you know how
important the hate crimes legislation is and that you will make the
best decision, and it will be the right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hung up the phone and thought, `What in the world could he
have been thinking,''' Shapiro said. ``And that night, of course,
we heard that Clinton was here and that he also was telling Texans
and Texas legislators what he thought that we ought to be doing.
And in putting both of those together, I decided it is politically
expedient for them at this point in time to come out from other
places all over the country and tell Texans what we ought to be
doing. And I quite frankly resent it.''
</P>
<P>
   During a fund-raising rally Friday evening in Austin, Clinton
talked with Francis Renee Mullins, the daughter of Jasper dragging
death victim James Byrd Jr., for whom the proposed legislation is
named.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro accused Clinton and Bradley of getting involved in the
issue because ``it is a political issue that they think they can
get mileage out of.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I care much more for my fellow senators on the floor and their
views,'' Shapiro added. ``I care much more for my fellow House
members and their views than I do Bill Clinton or Bill Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro is one of four Republicans on the seven-member Senate
Criminal Justice Committee, where a bill that would toughen the
state's hate crimes law, is stalled. The others are Sens. Robert
Duncan of Lubbock, Jane Nelson of Flower Mound and Mike Jackson of
Houston. None of the Republicans has thus far agreed to support the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly did not influence me one way or the other,''
Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mark my word,'' Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, said Monday.
``I will get the votes'' to get the bill out of committee. He is
the Senate sponsor for House Bill 938.
</P>
<P>
   As passed by the House, it would enhance penalties for those
convicted of crimes against a person because of the victim's race,
gender, ``sexual preference'' or any of seven other categories of
individuals. It would not, however, increase penalties for those
convicted of murder or capital murder.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis refused to say Monday whether he had asked Bradley to call
Shapiro.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis and other Democrats on the Criminal Justice Committee have
been trying to focus attention on Shapiro and other Republicans who
have supported hate crimes legislation in the past, but will not
this time.
</P>
<P>
   They contend Republicans oppose the inclusion of the ``sexual
preference'' language and because Texas Gov. George W. Bush does
not support the bill. Bush has said he will give serious
consideration to it if it passes the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro, however, said her opposition to the bill is not based
on the protection it would afford gays and lesbians but on the
delineation of protected groups.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro was a co-author of the hate crimes bill in 1993. ``I
agreed with it then,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Current law, however, enhances penalties for offenses
``committed because of bias or prejudice,'' but does not specify
groups or individuals that might be subjected to bias or prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is very specific and more narrowly defines those
people that will be protected,'' she said. ``That's where my
problem lies, specifically defining each of those (10 protected)
groups and leaving out other groups as they may occur down the
line.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Shapiro, whose grandparents and several other relatives died in
concentration camps during the Holocaust, admits she has been
lobbied by Jewish groups that favor the bill, but ``not any more
than any other group.''
</P>
<P>
   She said proponents also have been unable to explain to her how
the proposed change in the hate crimes law would increase the
prosecution of hate crimes laws which is now rare.

NETANYAHU CLOSES PLO OFFICES IN JERUSALEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as Israel-Jerusalem)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In a political move seen as both desperate and
dangerous, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered
offices in the PLO's Jerusalem headquarters closed Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   With recent polls showing Netanyahu's reelection bid faltering,
the order was seen as part of a campaign strategy to raise the
future of Jerusalem, a powerfully emotional issue for both Israelis
and Palestinians, to the center of debate.
</P>
<P>
   Political observers and campaign rivals say the timing of
Netanyahu's order was clearly politically motivated, coming less
than one week before voters take to the polls for the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is explosive, and virtually certain to erupt in
violence if the Netanyahu government proceeds to use force to shut
down the offices of the building known as Orient House.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from a political rally, Netanyahu told reporters Monday
night: ``Israel has full sovereignty over Jerusalem. That is why we
are issuing the orders to close these offices unless the
Palestinians do so themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu says three offices at Orient House are illegal because
they are used by the Palestinian Authority, which under peace deals
has no official standing in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians warn they will respond with violence if Israeli
police try to enter Orient House, focal point of Palestinian
political activity in Jerusalem. They say it is not used by the
Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Under Israeli law, the Palestinians would have 24 hours to
appeal the court ruling that gave Netanyahu's government the right
to enact the closure order. But the Palestinians said they would
not file an appeal, rejecting the authority of the Israeli courts
over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday night it remained unclear whether Israeli police
would enforce the order, or some form of compromise would be
reached.
</P>
<P>
   Located in historically Arab East Jerusalem, the entrance to the
sprawling Arab estate made of Jerusalem stone was heavily guarded
by hundreds of young Palestinian men Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers blared a song by Fairuz, the legendary Lebanese singer,
in which the lyrics speak of the Palestinian people's deep love and
willingness to fight for Jerusalem. A Palestinian flag was draped
over building's facade.
</P>
<P>
   Faisal Husseini, a member of the Palestinian National Authority
responsible for Jerusalem affairs and the director of Orient House,
stood at the doorway and said: ``We are not leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerusalem is too sensitive and too holy to become a card in
the Israeli political game,'' added Husseini, a scion of one of the
most influential Palestinian families, which has owned Orient House
for more than 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netanyahu will resort to anything in politics. But he should
realize, and the world should realize, this is a very explosive
situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shlomo Ben Ami, a parliament member and leader of the rival
Labor Party, said Monday Netanyahu is ``using patriotism and the
charged issue of Jerusalem to conceal his failures in so many other
domains.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is in office for nearly three years, but he waits for one
week before the election to do this? Voters will not be fooled by
that,'' Ben Ami added.
</P>
<P>
   Latest opinion polls show Netanyahu trailing Labor challenger
Ehud Barak by some eight percent. Netanyahu supporters are quick to
point to 1996 polls which showed him trailing by a similar margin
just before he won election.
</P>
<P>
   Israel sees Jerusalem as its eternal and indivisible capital.
The Palestinians see East Jerusalem, which was captured by Israel
from Jordan after the 1967 Six Day War, as the site of a future
state. Most of the international community, including the United
States, officially views the status of Jerusalem as undetermined.
</P>
<P>
   The historic 1993 Oslo accords called for Jerusalem and
Palestinian statehood to be among the issues to be negotiated in
the so-called ``final status'' agreements which are already more
than one year behind schedule in the deadlocked peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu threatened to walk away from the peace process if
Arafat made a unilateral move to declare Palestinian statehood, but
has been uninhibited in declaring that the future of Jerusalem is
``not open to debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked at a recent press conference whether his views on
Jerusalem were not a ``unilateral declaration,'' Netanyahu replied,
``Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The status of Jerusalem, as it stands now, remains fully under
Israeli sovereignty,'' he said. ``When we act to ensure our
sovereignty, we are not doing anything to act unilaterally.''
</P>
<P>
   A statement released by the US Embassy said: ``This is an
extremely sensitive situation and both sides have a responsibility
to defuse it.''

CHINA SAYS IT DOESN'T WANT BOSTON SYMPHONY TO PERFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i, a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The China Performing Arts Agency has officially
canceled the Boston Symphony Orchestra's scheduled concerts in
China Wednesday and Thursday. The agency took this action, it said,
in response to ``the barbarous atrocity of NATO'' in the bombing
Saturday of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   A fax received by BSO officials on tour in Japan Sunday stated
that the NATO bombing, which killed three people, ``has evoked the
utmost indignation of the Chinese government and people. As such we
believe the favorable atmosphere for the China tour at the moment
is no longer there, and no longer is it appropriate for the tour to
be conducted as originally scheduled.''
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra will return in two flights from Japan via Detroit
Tuesday. Music director Seiji Ozawa, who was born in China, will
travel to Beijing as scheduled to join his mother Sakora, 91, and
his brother who had already traveled to China; Ozawa still plans to
conduct his scheduled master class and rehearsal of Beethoven's
overture ``Leonore'' No. 3 in the Central Conservatory of Music
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   According to BSO managing director Mark Volpe, reached in Osaka
Monday, ``Our first information about the bombing in Belgrade was
sketchy, and monitoring the situation was quite difficult because
it was impossible to contact anyone in the American embassy in
Beijing. They were moving everyone out of there except for the
Marine guards.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night the designer Hanae Mori gave a reception for the
BSO and Ozawa in Tokyo, and the reception was attended by the
American ambassador to Japan and several deputies who were able to
supply home phone numbers for US embassy officials in Beijing, who
confirmed that the situation was serious, as did the BSO's contacts
in the US Information Agency. Later in the day, orchestra officials
received notice of the cancellation from the China Performing Arts
Agency, the government promoter.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's concert in Beijing was to be similar to the BSO's
outreach concert in Boston last month and to a program they played
on the Japan tour. The program was to be hosted by the leading
Chinese pop singer, Liu Huan, and attended by Prime Minister Zhu
Rongji and President Jiang Zemin. ``Certainly we are
disappointed,'' Volpe said, ``but we are also relieved that we are
not stepping into a troubled situation.''
</P>
<P>
   A statement from Ozawa read, ``I was born in China. One of the
proudest moments of my life was the Boston Symphony Orchestra's
trip to China in 1979. I have wanted to return to China with the
BSO for 20 years. I am terribly sad that we are not going back now.
I have decided to honor my commitment to give a master class in
Beijing, but obviously it's not the same without the BSO. I prefer
to think of this as a postponement, not a cancellation.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years have gone into planning the trip to Japan and China
to celebrate Ozawa's 25th anniversary as music director of the BSO.
Changing travel arrangements for the early return of the orchestra,
other people traveling along with the orchestra, and the cargo was
necessarily complicated, but at a post-concert party Sunday night,
orchestra members toasted the emergency skills of their travel
agent, California-based Tim Cole.

GUNS IN CHILDREN'S HANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The massacre in Littleton, Colo., like the other school
shootings before it, resulted from a lethal cocktail of mental
illness, parental neglect, and a culture besotted with violence.
But what makes this scale of carnage possible is the guns. The
nation's attention is riveted on one murderous incident, but 13
children die of gunshot wounds every day, many of them in accidents
when they get their hands on weapons that should be beyond their
reach.
</P>
<P>
   Guns are everywhere in America. After the Oklahoma tornadoes
last week, police hustled to keep ahead of looters in retrieving
hundreds of guns that littered the landsape after being blown out
of homes. Before the Brady Law took effect in 1994, there were more
gun dealers in the country than gas stations. Private collectors
can sell guns without background checks at gun shows or flea
markets or over the Internet. It is illegal for people under 21 to
possess an open beer can but not a loaded handgun. Something is
very wrong with this picture.
</P>
<P>
   The US Senate has a chance this week to close some of the
loopholes that allow teenagers to obtain guns legally. States
cannot do it alone. The crazy quilt of laws in each state makes
them too easy to subvert. There should be national laws to prevent
child access to weapons by requiring owners to use trigger-locking
devices or store weapons in a locked case. Only 16 states,
including Massachusetts, have such laws. Background checks, firearm
permits, or at the very least a waiting period for teenagers
between 18 and 21 should be a national standard. Teenagers in 37
states can buy a gun without so much as counting to ten.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as the National Rifle Association insists, more
should be done to enforce existing laws. But that is not enough.
Responsible gun owners, including leaders of the American Shooting
Sports Council, have split with the NRA to back some of the
common-sense gun controls being proposed this week. Massachusetts
has strong laws, but the children in states without protections are
no less precious; they should not be any less safe.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ When Zhang Qi, the state official who coordinates
China's Year 2000 computer policy, began asking government
ministries last August for monthly reports on their readiness, most
simply ignored her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not satisfied,'' said Ms. Zhang, a 53-year-old career
bureaucrat whose flinty demeanor seems perfectly suited to her
task. ``We are here to offer them service and technical support.
But quite a few did not send over information, and we had to call
them to find out their situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zhang got action only after she reminded her colleagues that
confronting the Year 2000, or Y2K, problem was a top priority of
Prime Minister Zhu Rongji and other leaders. ``It takes some time
to make them realize and believe the problem,'' she said with
ill-disguised impatience.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the United States and Europe, where the public
debate over the Year 2000 issue has gone through a full cycle _
from near-hysteria to having many people dismiss the whole thing as
a minor annoyance _ China is just waking up to the idea that on
Jan. 1, 2000, some of its computers may not work.
</P>
<P>
   (In general, the problem results from the reliance of many
programs on only the last two digits of a year. Unless updated,
some computers and electronic machinery might misinterpret ``00''
as 1900 rather than 2000, substitute another year or simply
freeze.)
</P>
<P>
   Experts here warn that China could suffer everything from severe
disruptions in power and water to lesser but still expensive
glitches in telecommunications, banking, public health and
transportation. And China's woes could spill over to Hong Kong,
where banks, brokerage firms and shipping companies with close ties
to the mainland are worried about lost cargo and missing payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is very, very behind in Y2K contingency planning,'' said
Joseph Sweeney, director of research at the Hong Kong office of
Gartner Group, a research firm that specializes in the Year 2000
problem. ``There's no way many of their organizations will come up
to speed in time.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet so little is known about the nature of the problem here that
the experts are often reduced to a digital-age version of reading
tea leaves as they scrounge for clues about how and where China
will be affected. The dearth of data is compounded by China's
computer network _ a mix of 1960s-era mainframe machines and
pirated copies of the latest Windows software running on a variety
of personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Shepheard-Walwyn, the chairman of the Global 2000
Coordinating Group, a consortium of 300 banks that monitors Year
2000 compliance, said he did not have enough information even to
make a judgment about China. He visited Beijing in March to prod
officials at the People's Bank of China for more details.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the resistance is that China is not nearly as dependent
on computers as the United States or other Asian countries. Seventy
percent of people live in rural areas, where computers _ let alone
computer bugs _ are barely known. Even in big cities, the prospect
of computer failures is not frightening to a country that measures
calamity on the scale of last year's Yangtze River floods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food still comes in on people's backs, water comes from a dam
upriver, and people don't use that much electricity anyway,'' said
R. Mark Mecham, deputy director of the U.S. Information Technology
Office in Beijing, a trade association that represents more than 50
computer makers.
</P>
<P>
   At a minimum, though, the Year 2000 problem could cramp China's
economy, which is growing despite the Asian slump. Gartner Group
estimates that 66 percent of Chinese companies will experience some
failure in their computers. That compares with 40 percent of
companies worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said China's Year 2000 problems were likely to be
concentrated in just the kind of places where the government wants
to showcase its future as a technologically advanced economy: the
Pudong district of Shanghai and Shenzhen, the special economic zone
that borders Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent survey, a Chinese research firm, Century Perspective
Market Research, found that only 15 percent of commercial and
governmental organizations had fixed Year 2000 flaws and tested
their systems.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers like these alarm foreign companies here, as well as
companies outside China that deal with the mainland. Hong Kong's
container port, for example, processes half of China's exports and
40 percent of its imports. Many of the invoices for those goods are
settled by payments that flow electronically between banks in Hong
Kong and their counterparts in mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   If the Chinese banks suffer computer malfunctions, it would
paralyze hundreds of millions of dollars of settlements within
days. Alan Fung, an area manager at Standard Chartered Bank in Hong
Kong, said the banks were already devising plans to channel
transactions through larger Chinese banks. Failing that, they might
resort to writing out transactions on paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Chinese banks fail to process transactions for one or
two days, that might not be a problem,'' Fung said. ``But if the
interruption is for four or five days, that's another issue.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Hong Kong's major utility, CLP Power, buys some of
its electricity from power plants in mainland China. Among those is
the Daya Bay nuclear power station in neighboring Guangdong
Province. A spokesman said 97 percent of CLP's Hong Kong systems
were ready. But he acknowledged that the company had little control
over Chinese suppliers like Daya Bay.
</P>
<P>
   American computer companies have fears of a different sort. They
sold China most of its 10 million computers. And although many have
dispatched teams here to repair bugs, they are afraid of being
dragged into Chinese courts if Year 2000-related glitches lead to
costly interruptions in services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very sensitive issue because relations with the
government are obviously very important,'' said Greg Shea, the
director of communications and government affairs for
Hewlett-Packard in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders say they are impressed by the noise Ms. Zhang has
generated since she became China's Year 2000 czar last August. With
a propaganda campaign that includes advertising, newspaper articles
and trips around the country, Ms. Zhang has introduced the term Y2K
to the Chinese vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   China has also made splashy symbolic gestures _ such as
requiring top officials of the Civil Aviation Administration to be
aloft on New Year's Eve as a show of confidence in the air traffic
control system.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Zhang has been more successful as an evangelist than a
trouble-shooter. That is because, in fixing Year 2000 problems, she
must overcome a gantlet of technological, financial and
institutional hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   One big problem is that an estimated 96 percent of the software
in China is pirated. Software manufacturers generally refuse to
repair products not sold under a license. Faced with buying a
license to become Year 2000 compliant, many Chinese companies
simply opt to leave their equipment alone.
</P>
<P>
   China's straitened finances are an even bigger hurdle. The
central government has given provincial and local governments a
deadline to be compliant that is supposed to lead to repairing all
identified problems by the end of September. But Beijing also says
they must foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
   China's banks alone have spent $600 million on Year 2000 fixes,
according to Ms. Zhang, so selling the party bosses in China's
unruly provinces on such a costly chore for public facilities and
the many businesses still under government control is no small
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officials who want to be promoted don't see this as an
opportunity,'' said Chen Xinxiang, a gregarious engineer who is
overseeing the Beijing municipal government's Year 2000
preparations.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, who has a Ph.D. from Pennsylvania State University, took
on the project as a sideline to his efforts to promote Internet use
in Beijing. He said he was confident that China's capital would not
suffer widespread breakdowns in transportation, telecommunications
or electricity.
</P>
<P>
   But Chen said there were potential trouble spots. The plant that
supplies two-thirds of Beijing's water cannot be shut down for
testing, and Chen said he did not know whether its computers were
vulnerable. Water would still flow if the computers malfunctioned,
but it might not be purified.
</P>
<P>
   On April 9, Beijing had a kind of dry run for Jan. 1. Because it
was the 99th day of 1999 _ many computers were programmed to read a
string of 9's as the end of a file _ some experts said April 9 was
the first of a series of dates that could cause electronic
glitches. Chen said there were three computer crashes in the city:
the reservations system of a luxury hotel, the network of a
company, and the board that displays exchange rates at a bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been telling people, `This is a tiny version of the Y2K
issue,''' Chen said. ``It was like an alarm.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his jitters, Chen said he would happily fly on New
Year's Eve. That reflects a growing view _ even among foreigners _
that China's skies will not be filled with dangerously wayward
airplanes. Officials here contend they are only six months behind
the Federal Aviation Administration in the testing and repair of
the country's air traffic control system. (If so, that confidence
could be overdone, since even the FAA says it does not expect to
finish until June.)
</P>
<P>
   Yi Qun, the deputy director of the Civil Aviation
Administration, said it was not hard to debug China's guidance and
communications equipment because most of it was made by foreign
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   With its top aviation officials at risk, China plans to adopt
precautionary measures, such as spacing planes farther apart in the
hours just before and after midnight on New Year's Eve, which falls
on a Friday this year.
</P>
<P>
   As the Year 2000 draws closer, the focus among computer
companies here has shifted from how to get ready for Jan. 1 to how
to deal with the fallout from inevitable failures afterward. IBM,
Hewlett-Packard and other companies are bracing for a blizzard of
lawsuits demanding compensation for Year 2000 losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still far from clear that American companies will get a
fair hearing in Chinese courts,'' Mecham said.
</P>
<P>
   IBM has played a central role in advising the Chinese government
on Year 2000 issues. But executives at rival companies said it was
taking a low profile as the threat of lawsuits loomed. IBM declined
to discuss its efforts in China.
</P>
<P>
   The companies may have reason to worry. Beijing initially
ordered its ministries to demand free repairs. Suppliers that
refused would no longer be allowed to sell products to the
government, according to a mid-1997 directive.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zhang has since softened that line, saying China no longer
expects companies to bear the entire cost of repairs. ``The
question is, how much should they pay?'' she said. ``Chinese users
have already paid a lot. And as we know, big companies like IBM
never do anything free of charge.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, though, Ms. Zhang has cultivated close relations
with the computer industry. It is easy to understand why: With 18
government departments reporting to her on Year 2000 readiness, she
needs a constant stream of advice from experts on where to channel
her energies.
</P>
<P>
   Of the government departments, in fact, only the People's
Liberation Army does not have to report to Ms. Zhang on the Year
2000 issue. ``Maybe they are able to solve it themselves,'' she
said with a faint smile.

CHINA SAYS IT DOESN'T WANT BOSTON SYMPHONY TO PERFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i, a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The China Performing Arts Agency has officially
canceled the Boston Symphony Orchestra's scheduled concerts in
China Wednesday and Thursday. The agency took this action, it said,
in response to ``the barbarous atrocity of NATO'' in the bombing
Saturday of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   A fax received by BSO officials on tour in Japan Sunday stated
that the NATO bombing, which killed three people, ``has evoked the
utmost indignation of the Chinese government and people. As such we
believe the favorable atmosphere for the China tour at the moment
is no longer there, and no longer is it appropriate for the tour to
be conducted as originally scheduled.''
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra will return in two flights from Japan via Detroit
Tuesday. Music director Seiji Ozawa, who was born in China, will
travel to Beijing as scheduled to join his mother Sakora, 91, and
his brother who had already traveled to China; Ozawa still plans to
conduct his scheduled master class and rehearsal of Beethoven's
overture ``Leonore'' No. 3 in the Central Conservatory of Music
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   According to BSO managing director Mark Volpe, reached in Osaka
Monday, ``Our first information about the bombing in Belgrade was
sketchy, and monitoring the situation was quite difficult because
it was impossible to contact anyone in the American embassy in
Beijing. They were moving everyone out of there except for the
Marine guards.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night the designer Hanae Mori gave a reception for the
BSO and Ozawa in Tokyo, and the reception was attended by the
American ambassador to Japan and several deputies who were able to
supply home phone numbers for US embassy officials in Beijing, who
confirmed that the situation was serious, as did the BSO's contacts
in the US Information Agency. Later in the day, orchestra officials
received notice of the cancellation from the China Performing Arts
Agency, the government promoter.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's concert in Beijing was to be similar to the BSO's
outreach concert in Boston last month and to a program they played
on the Japan tour. The program was to be hosted by the leading
Chinese pop singer, Liu Huan, and attended by Prime Minister Zhu
Rongji and President Jiang Zemin. ``Certainly we are
disappointed,'' Volpe said, ``but we are also relieved that we are
not stepping into a troubled situation.''
</P>
<P>
   A statement from Ozawa read, ``I was born in China. One of the
proudest moments of my life was the Boston Symphony Orchestra's
trip to China in 1979. I have wanted to return to China with the
BSO for 20 years. I am terribly sad that we are not going back now.
I have decided to honor my commitment to give a master class in
Beijing, but obviously it's not the same without the BSO. I prefer
to think of this as a postponement, not a cancellation.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years have gone into planning the trip to Japan and China
to celebrate Ozawa's 25th anniversary as music director of the BSO.
Changing travel arrangements for the early return of the orchestra,
other people traveling along with the orchestra, and the cargo was
necessarily complicated, but at a post-concert party Sunday night,
orchestra members toasted the emergency skills of their travel
agent, California-based Tim Cole.

DEFUSING THE CRISIS WITH CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chinese displays of state-supervised anger against the United
States for the bombing of China's embassy in Belgrade did not
originate in a void. Hard-liners in the United States and China
prepared the way for the current frenzy, with one side stoking
distrust of ``American hegemonism'' and the other indulging in what
Henry Kissinger has called ``a nostalgia for confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a conspiratorialist in the Oliver Stone mold could believe
that Washington wanted to guide three bombs into the Chinese
Embassy in Serbia, thereby validating Beijing's nationalist
propaganda and alienating a government that can veto any Kosovo
peace plan brought to the UN Security Council for approval.
</P>
<P>
   But the China-baiting of some US politicians has played into the
hands of Chinese Communists who want to distract the discontented
masses and legitimize their regime by means of patriotism and
xenophobia. This, after all, is the year of three fateful
anniversaries: the 50th for the Communist takeover, the 40th for
the invasion of Tibet, and the 10th since the Tiananmen bloodbath.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's state-controlled media hid the truth about Serbia's
brutal uprooting of 1.5 million Albanian Kosovars. Now the
government is hiding news of President Clinton's regrets for the
embassy bombing while stage-managing anti-American protests and
demanding an American apology.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis in US-Chinese relations _ a crisis that imperils the
interests of both countries _ has come about not merely because of
a CIA mapping mistake but also because self-serving hard-liners in
both countries have been goading each other into playing with fire.
</P>
<P>
   At one Beijing protest, students from the China Drama Academy
carried a placard depicting President Clinton as a Statue of
Liberty covered in blood and bearing a missile instead of freedom's
torch. To undo the damage of this image, Clinton should amplify his
apologies so that they reach the Chinese public _ the same audience
that responded with friendly enthusiasm during his visit to China
only last June.

LYCOS DEAL REPORTEDLY VIEWED UNFAVORABLY BY HOLDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lycos Inc. executives now doubt shareholders would approve the
Internet company's proposed merger with operations of USA Networks
Inc., say people familiar with the matter, setting the stage for
further negotiations between the two companies if they decide to
abandon their agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The deal's dimming prospects caused shares in Lycos to surge 18
percent Monday, as investors hoped for a sweeter bid or, if Lycos
stays independent, an increase in the company's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of a deal announced in February, approval from a
majority of holders of Lycos' 43 million shares would be needed for
elements of New York-based USA Networks to be combined with Lycos,
one of the largest portals on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was thrown into jeopardy in March after the chief
executive of Lycos' largest shareholder, Andover, Mass. venture
firm CMGI Inc., withdrew his support.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI's David Wetherell joined critics who said the agreement
didn't acknowledge the potential value of the portal company. CMGI,
which owns about 20 percent of Lycos, had enough votes to block the
deal, Wetherell said. Meanwhile, Lycos chief executive Bob Davis
vowed to convince enough holders to complete it.
</P>
<P>
   USA Networks head Barry Diller had also remained supportive, and
Lycos was expected to schedule a vote on the deal by early July.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has yet to mail shareholders the statements
needed for such a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Now they may never go out as Lycos executives have concluded the
math is not on their side. About 45 percent of shareholders either
oppose the deal, including CMGI, or aren't likely to vote at all,
said people familiar with the matter. The upshot is that Lycos, of
Waltham, Mass., would have to win 10 out of every 11 votes in the
remaining pool, making victory difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal quotes anonymous sources saying USA
Networks was expected to abandon its bid. Spokespeople for USA
Networks declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   However, USA Networks can't unilaterally walk away from the
deal. The merger agreement between the two companies states that
under current circumstances, either would need to gain the other
company's consent to call off the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming a vote doesn't take place, now the two companies must
bargain over just how USA Networks might withdraw its bid or,
potentially, bring in a new partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see them go alone for the next six to twelve
months,'' said Michael Goldston, principal at Cambridge Equity
Advisors, Nashville Tenn., who holds 40,000 Lycos shares. ``If
somebody looks at buying them six to twelve months from now, I
think the price would be 30 to 40 percent higher,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though many leading Internet companies have found marriage
partners lately, an independent Lycos would still have strengths,
said Golston. For one thing, it would be free to continue the
acquisition spree it undertook last year that brought it control of
assets like Wired Ventures. Those new services helped it gain more
viewers in March than arch-rival Yahoo Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Also, certain regulations that have prevented Lycos from
undertaking mergers known as ``pooling-of-interest'' transactions
will lapse in September, making it easier for Lycos to buy other
companies or to sell itself outright.
</P>
<P>
   But the end of the deal with Diller might also strengthen the
hand of CMGI's Wetherell, who has said he might try to bring in
another partner for Lycos. CMGI's stock now trades at more than
twice what it did at the time the deal was announced, making it
easier for CMGI to bid on Lycos outright. A CMGI spokeswoman
declined to comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors still favor the agreement with Diller. CMGI
holder Alex Cheung, of the Monument Internet Fund, in Bethesda,
Md., said he liked the agreement because of the access Lycos would
gain to USA Networks assets like the Home Shopping Network
cable-television system and the Ticketmaster service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the long-term, probably a combination of Lycos and
USA Networks would be a very potent economic force,'' Cheung said.
``But they have to market the deal to people with a short-term
focus.''
</P>
<P>
   But pessimists like Barry Parr, electronic commerce analyst at
International Data Corp. in Mountain View, Calif., worry a collapse
of the USA/Lycos deal would leave Lycos company in a precarious
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need two things they don't have. One is a media
partner,'' Parr said. ``The other is a consistent, well-known
brand.'' Lycos users are much less loyal than users of the rival
Yahoo Web portal, Parr said.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Lycos rose 15 3/4 to close at $105 in Nasdaq trading
Monday. CMGI stock rose 16 11/16 to 237 15/16. USA Networks shares
dipped 1/8 to 35 1/4.

COMPANIES HOPE TO MAKE BRAZILIAN SOCCER A WINNING INVESTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Luiz Carlos Faloppa loves rooting for his
soccer team. Yet he has not attended a match in person for eight
years, disgusted with the concrete slab seating and the irate fans
who lob urine-filled plastic cups and brawl with supporters of
rival clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of getting urine tossed on my back,'' said Faloppa,
a 39-year-old executive at a magazine publisher. Now he watches
soccer only on television.
</P>
<P>
   Years of mismanagement and neglect have left Brazilian soccer in
disarray, with only diehard fans, mostly young males, mustering
courage to attend matches live. The situation is not much better
for players, who are subject to a punishing schedule of games,
bound by an archaic system limiting their ability to negotiate
lucrative contracts and often threatened with violence on and off
the field.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, foreign and Brazilian investment firms increasingly see
opportunities to transform Brazilian soccer into a money-maker. For
example, Nationsbank _ now Bank of America _ purchased the
licensing rights of the Vasco da Gama club of Rio de Janeiro. And
in the most widely publicized transaction, Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP;
Furst Inc., the Dallas-based buyout firm with investments
throughout Latin America, announced a deal in April giving it the
marketing and licensing rights for Corinthians, Sao Paulo's largest
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soccer in Brazil is like baseball, basketball and football put
together,'' said Charles Tate, the firm's president. The
transaction gives Hicks, Muse all licensing rights of the club's
name, enabling it to sell items like caps or T-shirts emblazoned
with the Corinthians' insignia as well as the opportunity to
negotiate deals for the television broadcast of games. Hicks, Muse
has already entered into pay-TV ventures in Brazil and in
neighboring Argentina that could facilitate such deals.
</P>
<P>
   Tate said Hicks, Muse would use its knowledge from experiences
in the United States, where it has interests in sports ranging from
professional baseball and hockey to rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   The entrance of American companies like Hicks, Muse into
Brazilian soccer is the latest chapter of a wide-reaching
transformation that began largely with efforts by the most famous
soccer player in Brazil, Edson Arantes do Nascimento, better known
as Pele. After retiring from the game, Pele was named minister of
sports in 1994 by the newly elected president, Fernando Henrique
Cardoso. He strongly encouraged clubs to treat players, many of
whom came from poor backgrounds, with greater respect. He also
sought to limit corruption in clubs by spurring them to make the
leap from nonprofit organizations into for-profit companies.
</P>
<P>
   Pele, now 58, last year persuaded Congress to approve
legislation that required greater transparency of club finances and
better accounting procedures. This change has paved the way for
potential investors to consider deals with some of Brazil's larger
teams. Another part of the legislation, known as the Pele Law,
phases out an antiquated system in which players had little freedom
to negotiate contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pele Law laid the groundwork that investors needed to
start taking Brazilian football seriously,'' said John Michael
Streithorst, the director of new business ventures at Banco Icatu,
an investment bank based in Rio de Janeiro, which had negotiated
with Corinthians before the club's deal with Hicks, Muse.
</P>
<P>
   Streithorst likens the current situation of Brazilian soccer to
that of Britain in the 1980s, when the sport was widely known in
that country for violent clashes among hooligans. With the entry of
private investors into the sport, however, and with lucrative
pay-TV licensing contracts, soccer's image improved, and a broader
array of fans began to attend games.
</P>
<P>
   Another domestic authority on the Brazilian soccer business,
talk show host and newspaper columnist Juca Kfouri, has estimated
that it may be possible for sports to generate 4 percent of
Brazil's gross domestic product in a few years, up from 1.5 percent
today. ``Thank God capitalism is winning out against the feudal
attitudes that have prevailed in this sport for too long,'' Kfouri
said. ``With the talent produced here, Brazil could have the NBA of
world soccer.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That potential, combined with the transformation of soccer in
recent years in Europe, where some clubs have gone so far as to
sell stock to the public, has not limited investors only to
contracts with individual clubs. For instance, the Globo media
group and several Rio de Janeiro investment banks have invested $30
million in Lance, a daily sports newspaper founded in 1997 along
the lines of France's L'Equipe and Italy's Gazzetta dello Sport.
Although Lance publishes some articles about other sports,
including auto racing and volleyball, soccer dominates. And the
newspaper unabashedly supports efforts to improve management at
soccer teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having more private capital in clubs should act like a
benevolent virus, in which the good cells expel the bad cells,''
said Walter de Mattos, the newspaper's 36-year-old publisher.
</P>
<P>
   One large problem facing those hoping to transform Brazilian
soccer is the way games are scheduled. In Brazil, a club can play
up to 90 games a year, compared with 60 or 70 in Europe. Players
often complain of the effects of the grueling schedule. And there
is an array of championships and other tournaments, making
schedules confusing.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, soccer as a business is expanding even outside of
the two largest cities, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. In the
northeastern state of Bahia, Opportunity, an investment group,
formed a venture with the state's largest club. Even Pele is
considering similar deals. He has left his post as minister of
sports and now dedicates part of his time to Pele Sports and
Marketing, which is searching for possible ventures. &QL;

 &HT;    President to visit Atlanta Tuesday
 &HT;    By Carlos Campos
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sonya Jones will welcome President Clinton to her
Atlanta business today in the same way that many Southerners
welcome people _ with some good ol' down-home cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is the owner of a bakery and a restaurant in the Sweet
Auburn Curb Market downtown. She plans on offering the president a
bite of one of her Southern specialities, a sweet potato
cheesecake...''and I want to send him with one back to the White
House,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will be visiting with Jones and other vendors at the
city-supported Curb Market to get a closeup of their businesses,
and talk with them about what government and big business can do to
give small entrepenuers a boost.
</P>
<P>
   The brief trip to Atlanta at 2 p.m. today is part of the
unveiling of the Clinton administration's new markets strategy,
designed to encourage growth in underserved communities such as
rural areas, the inner city and Native American reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will be calling on local corporations to play a greater
role in helping small businesses grow in those communities. Three
Georgia chief executives, Leo Mullin of Delta Airlines, Duane
Ackerman of BellSouth and Dan Amos of AFLAC in Columbus, Ga., will
attend a roundtable meeting with the president in Washington this
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Gold, press secretary for Mayor Bill Campbell, said the
president chose Atlanta from among 10 cities where federal
Empowerment Zones are in place. Campbell will meet Clinton at the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just tremendously proud of this opportunity to present
Atlanta to President Clinton and his administration of all that we
have accomplished with the tremendous level of cooperation between
Washington and the Campbell administration,'' Gold said. ``We're
especially pleased with the progress of the Empowerment Zone.
Although it's a work in progress, there are many successes that we
can talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   The city chose the curb market for the president to visit
because it illustrates his new markets program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here you have the Curb Market less than a mile away from some
of the cities' most successful businesses, like BellSouth and
Georgia Pacific,'' Gold said. ``The president ... is calling on big
businesses to support the smaller industries and businesses in
their communities so that they too can get a leg up and benefit
from America's robust economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Donegan and others financed Eureka themselves, but said she gets
tax breaks for hiring people because her restaurant is in the
Empowerment Zone.
</P>
<P>
   She said business has been brisk since opening in November.
</P>
<P>
   Donegan said she plans to tell Clinton that government
assistance in urban renewal in areas such as Cabbagetown ``can
definitely happen. I think it's a good role model what we're doing
here. They're definitely they're to help you do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's what he'll be curious about, to see how things
are going and what other areas we really need more help in,'' Jones
said. ``There are areas that people have overlooked because of
certain locations. I'm very, very excited. I just think it's so
great that he's taking a personal interest in it, to come see
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid, the operations manager of the Kaffee Shoppe, a coffee shop
that also sells deli sandwiches, said she's excited about the
``once in a lifetime'' chance to meet with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to talk to him about more funding for marketing the
(Sweet Auburn Curb) market,'' Reid said. ``It's hard on the small
businesses because media, newspaper and radio ads, is so expensive.
It puts a big dent in the income.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's plane is expected to arrive at Hartsfield
Atlanta International Airport at 1:30 p.m., and depart about 4 p.m.

 &HT;    Georgia-Pacific attempts takeover of Unisource Worldwide
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia-Pacific Corp., moving to shore up its
distribution network for paper products, has launched a $1.49
billion bid for Pennsylvania-based Unisource Worldwide Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Unisource's board of directors said Monday it had authorized
discussions with Georgia-Pacific about the Atlanta-based forest
product company's cash merger proposal, which tops an existing
offer. That $1.3 billion offer from UGI Corp., a Pennsylvania-based
energy company, is still pending, Unisource said.
</P>
<P>
   A. D. ``Pete'' Correll, chairman and chief executive officer of
Georgia-Pacific, said Unisource's paper supplies and distribution
business would ``provide a good strategic fit'' with
Georgia-Pacific Group's paper and tissue businesses.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the merged companies could save money by trimming
overlapping distribution functions. Georgia-Pacific currently
distributes its own building products, but uses other companies to
handle its paper products.
</P>
<P>
   Unisource is rated as the nation's largest distributor of paper
products and janitorial supplies. Based in Berwyn, Pa., with 12,000
employees, Unisource reported net income of $37.7 million and
revenues of $7.4 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific Group, which excludes the company's timber
business, has 45,000 employees and is the second-largest U.S. maker
of building products and paper. The company reported net income of
$98 million and revenue of $13.22 billion for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Georgia-Pacific is doing is recognizing that the
distribution channel is becoming important,'' said Mark W.
Connelly, an analyst with J.P. Morgan Securities. Noting that
Unisource already distributes Georgia-Pacific paper products, he
said the acquisition was a ``logical move'' for the Atlanta-based
company.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific once owned a paper distribution company, Butler
Paper, which it sold in 1993 to Alco Standard Corp. in a
cost-cutting move. Unisource was formed three years later as a
spinoff from Alco.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly said, however, that while an acquisition makes good
strategic sense for Georgia-Pacific by giving it control of
distribution channels, ``it won't do a lot for earnings'' because
of low-margins in that part of the business.
</P>
<P>
   Impact on stock
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Pacific's stock fell nearly 7 percent Monday after
investors weighed the impact of a possible deal on the company's
bottom line. The company's stock, which is up 57 percent since the
beginning of the year, reached an intraday 52-week high of $99.50
before falling sharply to close at $92.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently announced a 2-for-1 stock split, payable
June 3 to shareholders of record May 14.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Monday's announcement, Moody's Investors Service
said it placed $5.5 billion in Georgia-Pacific debt securities
under review for a possible downgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgia-Pacific has operated with high debt levels since a
large acquisition several years ago. Although debt protection
measurements had begun to improve, this acquisition may reverse
this improvement,'' Moody's said.
</P>
<P>
   ``While an acquisition by G-P would likely improve the company's
credit quality, Moody's believes that the introduction of a new
merger candidate could interrupt the timing and effectiveness of
the company's ongoing operations in Atlanta,'' the service said.
</P>
<P>
   The merger announcement comes two weeks after Georgia-Pacific
Group reported that building products sales generated turnaround
earnings for the first quarter of $99 million. That was sharply up
from $4 million in net income from a year earlier, which included
$12 million for early retirement of debt.
</P>
<P>
   The company is benefiting from a boom in homebuilding. Correll
said in March that Georgia-Pacific was more inclined to expand
building products operations than those that make paper, which have
suffered from declining prices.
</P>
<P>
   Terms for Unisource
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific offered $12 per share in cash, or about $842
million, for Unisource's 70 million shares outstanding. Unisource
said outstanding debt of $440 million plus off-balance sheet debt
of $210 million would boost the value of the transation to $1.49
billion.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Unisource agreed to a merger with UGI that valued
Unisource stock at $11.50 per share. UGI had offered to swap 0.566
shares of UGI common stock for each share of Unisource stock.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was approved by both companies' boards but adverse
investor reaction sent UGI stock into a tailspin. That offer is now
valued at $10.08 per share, or $705 million, based on UGI's closing
price of 17 13/16 Friday.
</P>
<P>
   UGI, based in King of Prussia, Pa., declined comment Monday.The
company is the largest U.S. propane seller and also operates an
electric and natural gas utility in Pennsylvania.

ADVERTISING COLUMN: RHEINGOLD TRIES TO REVIVE VENERABLE NEW YORK
BRAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Striving to put the ``gold'' back in Rheingold, the
top executives in charge of reviving the venerable New York beer
brand are revamping their marketing efforts with an overhaul that
includes a new agency.
</P>
<P>
   Rheingold Brewing Co. has hired DeVito/Verdi in New York, an
agency known for sharply humorous creative work for advertisers
like New York magazine and Office Depot. DeVito/Verdi succeeds
Ferrell Calvillo Communications in New York, which handled the
account during the brand's initial reintroduction last year.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the agency change comes a Web site,
www.rheingoldbeer.com, created by Compelling Content, an Internet
agency in New York, and an increased focus on male beer drinkers
ages 21 to 34. As a result, the ads in year two assume a jocular,
hypermasculine tone to promote Rheingold as the brew ``for the few
real men still left.''
</P>
<P>
   The makeover for the brand _ formally Rheingold Extra Dry Lager
Beer _ is indicative of the competitive nature of the American beer
market as giants like Anheuser-Busch increase market share and
consumers restlessly switch from domestics to imports to microbrews
and back again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rheingold faces significant hurdles to gain awareness,
especially among younger drinkers when competitors like Budweiser,
Heineken, Coors Light and Corona are spending a lot more dollars in
the New York metropolitan area,'' said Benj Steinman, president at
Beer Marketer's Insights in Nanuet, N.Y., a trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Rheingold has residual affection from those who
recall drinking the beer from the 1940s through the 1970s. Many
older New Yorkers can still sing the brand's familiar jingle, which
begins: ``My beer is Rheingold, the dry beer. Think of Rheingold
whenever you buy beer.'' But the drinkers born long after Brooklyn
lost the Dodgers are the crucial segment of the market because they
consume the bulk of the beer sold each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building a franchise with younger adult consumers is the
future of the brand,'' said Michael H. Mitaro, president at
Rheingold Brewing in White Plains.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it has been a big surprise to us that the best business
we're doing is in bars where those consumers are in lower Manhattan
neighborhoods like the East Village, West Village and SoHo,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   To capitalize on that, said Walter H. Liebman, the managing
director at Rheingold Brewing, whose family owned the brand until
1963, the ads are being changed to ``make them contemporary to
young adults.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is being done with ``a New York personality,'' he
added, laughing, ``that we're all sort of difficult to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   So radio commercials, heard on WFAN-AM as Rheingold sponsors
coverage of New York Mets games, present barbed parodies. In one
spot, a weakling impresses his girlfriend by bonking a bully with
``a refreshing bottle of Rheingold'' _ empty, of course. In another
spot, after a nurturing, caring man attends to the every need of
his ``poopie,'' an announcer intones: ``If you're repulsed by what
you just heard, then have we got a beer for you. A manly beer.
Rheingold Extra Dry.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercials are ``meant to be tongue-in-cheek, said Sal
DeVito, creative director at DeVito/Verdi, ``not meant to be taken
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to get noticed,'' he added. ``If you take it with a
smile, it's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Of two other ways Rheingold hopes to get noticed, one is old and
the other is new. The old tactic is one first used last year:
hiring people to wear sandwich boards peddling the brand. The
walking billboards are being placed at bars and restaurants where
younger drinkers congregate.
</P>
<P>
   The new tactic is the Web site, which tries to fuel ``a retro
mystique'' for Rheingold among the post-baby-boom consumers, said
Marshall Karp, president and chief executive at Compelling Content.
There are pages offering beer and New York trivia quizzes, the
lyrics to the original Rheingold jingle and a glimpse at the 1958
edition of a popular previous promotion, the annual vote to anoint
``Miss Rheingold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you market a beer that has been off the market 20
years?'' Karp asked. ``You make it relevant to today's beer drinker
with humor and irreverence, giving the history of the brand in a
fun way.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the campaign, with an estimated budget of $1 million to
$2 million, seems to have made only one faux pas. In a commercial
that sells a make-believe fragrance named Whisper ``for the
sensitive man in these sensitive times,'' the announcer interrupts
at one point to declare: ``Excuse me, excuse me. I just couldn't
let this go on. Real men don't wear pansy cologne.''
</P>
<P>
   The spot is the second recent ad aimed at younger men that can
be deemed vaguely menacing; a print ad for Wendy's International
carries the headline ``This is a burger town, pretty boy.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, who you calling pansy, beer belly?

GUNS BARELY MENTIONED AT YOUTH VIOLENCE `SUMMIT' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Colo., Calif.)  (nk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sarah Brady, a leading crusader against guns, found
common ground with Robert Ricker, a lobbyist for gun makers. Steve
Case, head of America On Line, and Doug Lowenstein, who represents
the trade association for video-game makers, agreed to try to
prevent children from buying violent video games on the Internet
that they are barred from buying in stores.
</P>
<P>
   And Eric Heydenberk, a 12-year-old from Quakertown, Pa., said he
was creating a Web page to tell other kids how to handle being
bullied. (He also slipped a copy of the latest CD from his jazz
band to the president.)
</P>
<P>
   Lots of small moments emerged from President Clinton's
three-hour ``summit'' Monday on youth and violence, as did a pledge
by the administration to campaign against violence. But one
immediate result of the talkathon, at which 50 people spoke and
which the press was barred from viewing, was to defuse blame for
the school massacre in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was exactly the kind of session I had hoped for, where
everyone was talking about the problems and the opportunities,''
Clinton told reporters later in the Rose Garden. ``No one was
pointing the finger of blame.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a big relief to Ricker, the lobbyist for the American
Shooting Sports Council. He said the atmosphere was constructive,
even friendly, and that no one put heat on the gun industry or on
anyone else in particular for what they all agreed was a vastly
complex societal problem. Because of the summit, he said afterward,
``I don't think the focus will be on guns.''
</P>
<P>
   That seems a safe assumption. So many factors were identified _
the Internet, movies, parental responsibility, domestic violence,
lack of religious faith, a coarsening of the culture _ that guns
were lost in the shuffle.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton said that the White House was undertaking
a national campaign against youth violence modeled on previous
campaigns to reduce teen pregnancy and find jobs for people on
welfare. ``It will come forward, we hope, with very specific
suggestions about what parents can do, what schools can do, what
community groups can do, what the media can do, what gun
manufacturers can do, what all of us can do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was impressed with such murky results. Pheniece
Jones, a 16-year-old who was part of the crew from U.S. Kids TV,
which did not film the event but listened to the adult chatter
afterward, said: ``It seemed like ordinary stuff that people say
all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   What would she tell her friends? ``That I met Andrew Shue and he
was really nice,'' she said, referring to the former star of
Melrose Place.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not stop the adults from patting themselves on the
back for what they said was a conciliatory session _ what Gary
Bauer, a Republican candidate for president who was not invited,
called ``a feel-good forum, lots of talk and not much action,'' in
sum, ``a perfect Clinton administration event.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, who has been criticized for going soft on
Hollywood _ particularly as he prepares for a $1.5 million Beverly
Hills fund-raiser later this week hosted by David Geffen, the
Hollywood mogul _ did offer a mild rebuke to the entertainment
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot pretend that there is no impact on our culture and
our children that is adverse if there is too much violence coming
out of what they see and experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said parents could ``turn off the television'' if they didn't
like what their children were watching. He said they should monitor
what their children are doing on the Internet and refuse to buy
products that glorify violence.
</P>
<P>
   He did not ask the entertainment industry to stop making such
products, only that they not dangle them in front of youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to ask people who produce things to consider the
consequences of them, whether it's a violent movie, a CD, a video
game,'' the president said. ``If they are made, they at least
should not be marketed to children.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of
America, said he did not want the movies singled out and said he
supported a study by the U.S. Surgeon General to figure out ``the
why'' of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also believe that church and home and school are the three
places where children learn what is right and what is wrong, and
that's where they build a strong moral shield,'' Valenti said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With an eye toward gun-control legislation that the Senate is to
take up Tuesday, Clinton noted that the gun makers had endorsed
some of his ``common-sense'' proposals. They include: raising the
age to 21 from 18 for owning a handgun; requiring background checks
of people who buy guns at gun shows; banning juveniles convicted of
violent felonies from ever owning a gun; prosecuting parents if
they let their children use a gun for a crime; and expanding the
government's gun-tracing program.
</P>
<P>
   There was no mention of the two administration proposals that
the gun makers resolutely oppose _ limiting handgun purchases to
one a month and reinstituting the three-day waiting period for
buying a gun that expired Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Brady, whose husband, James, was shot during the 1981
assassination attempt against President Reagan, said she wanted to
``commend'' the gun makers for ``coming to the table'' and
``opening a dialogue that has not been there in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Across town, the National Rifle Association reacted with some
irritation to the summit, to which its top officials had not been
invited. Standing with the rifle association was another lobbyist
for the gun industry who had been invited to the summit but
boycotted it.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbyist, Robert Delfay, president of the National Shooting
Sports Foundation, said he boycotted the event because the White
House had submitted its legislation to Congress on Friday, before
giving the foundation a chance to shape it. He also said he wanted
to express solidarity with the rifle association.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the NRA, said he was
miffed that he had not been invited because his organization
teaches gun safety. The real problem, he said, is that no one is
enforcing the laws that are already on the books.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can talk about the culture of violence for the next 10
years,'' he said. ``Unless you start prosecution, you're never
going to cut to the culture of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Baker, the NRA's chief lobbyist, said that ultimately he
expected little to come of the legislation on Capitol Hill. ``At
the end of the day, I see little or nothing passing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the proposals have already been rejected by Congress, he
noted. As for any anti-gun momentum spurred by the Littleton
shootings, he said: ``I don't think any of the proposals, whether
they come from us or from the White House, are responsive in any
way or would have had any effect on what happened at Littleton.''

YUGOSLAV PULLOUT OFFER NOT ENOUGH, US SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH AND KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As cracks appeared to surface in the NATO alliance
because of the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade,
Yugoslavia announced Monday that it was withdrawing half of its
armed forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   US officials branded the pullout a ``half-measure'' that did not
comply with NATO demands for full withdrawal and other conditions
for a cease-fire. NATO remained on the defensive for Friday's
embassy bombing, with President Clinton apologizing for what he
called a ``tragic mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said the air campaign would continue
until Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic met its terms. About
40,000 Yugoslav troops, police, and special forces are believed to
be stationed in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of the partial Yugoslav withdrawal and the
mistaken embassy bombing threatened to cause divisions within NATO
about how the war should continue.
</P>
<P>
   The German government was noticeably less hostile to the
overtures from Yugoslavia than Washington and London, and there was
unusually harsh criticism of NATO by the British opposition. The
German government's official spokesman said Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder would study the announcement from Belgrade before
commenting on it.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder called for a ``full and thorough'' investigation into
the embassy bombing, while a government spokesman in Berlin said
NATO's explanation so far is ``not satisfactory.'' Italy, which has
been more dubious of the war all along, repeated Schroeder's call,
saying it was vital for NATO's credibility that there be an
investigation that publicly explains what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing of the Chinese Embassy was a political and public
relations disaster for Clinton, who has had a tempestuous
relationship with China throughout his presidency. After two days
of protests by thousands of students who hurled rocks and other
debris at the US Embassy in Beijing, the demonstrations eased up
Monday, but US Ambassador James Sasser and aides remained inside
for security reasons, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Clinton sought to placate Beijing with his apology but
at the same time he called for continued shelling of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I apologize. I regret this. But it's very important to
remember that this was an isolated, tragic event,'' Clinton said
about the embassy bombing. By comparison, he told a White House
audience, ``the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo, which has led to the
killing of thousands of people and the relocation of hundreds of
thousands, is a deliberate and systematic crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Three Chinese journalists were killed and 20 other people were
wounded in the attack, Chinese officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing of the embassy occurred because NATO planners,
acting on information from the CIA and other agencies, used an
outdated map of Belgrade that showed the old Chinese Embassy in a
different location, according to Defense Secretary William S.
Cohen. He said the maps did not include the new embassy that opened
in the last few years adjacent to the building NATO had intended to
target.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of systems failed'' to catch such an error, Cohen
said at a Pentagon briefing. Cohen said it was ``not a human or
mechanical error. It was an institutional error.'' He defended
NATO's bombing record, saying a dozen strikes out of 4,036 bombing
targets have resulted in civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he had seen no evidence that Milosevic had begun
pulling forces from Kosovo. ``Simply saying he is going to withdraw
part of his forces is completely insufficient,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said, ``If there ever
was a definition of a half measure, that is it.'' Officials also
noted that the Yugoslav statement made no provision for the return
of ethnic Albanian refugees, a key NATO demand.
</P>
<P>
   Some Western diplomats suggested the German circumspection
stemmed more from Schroeder's visit this week to China, and his
planned visit with Russian Balkans envoy Viktor S. Chernomyrdin,
than any real break from the European consensus that NATO cannot
let up in its war until Milosevic gives in. In protest, Beijing
trimmed Schroeder's planned four-day visit to a single day. A
Chinese-European Union trade summit this week was also canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said that while Schroeder's statements were
understandable given his travel schedule, the remarks of German
Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping were more indicative of German
government opinion. Responding to the Yugoslav Army's announcement
of troops being withdrawn, Scharping said changing NATO's approach
``on the basis of a propaganda maneuver would be an act of gross
recklessness.''
</P>
<P>
   In the British House of Commons, there was unusually frank
criticism of NATO by Michael Howard, the opposition Conservative
Party's shadow foreign secretary. Howard called the embassy bombing
``an act of gross incompetence'' and said NATO's strategy appeared
to be ``made up as it goes along.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the Newspaper Society in London, however, Prime
Minister Tony Blair said: ``There have been civilian deaths in
Belgrade, yes. But how does it compare to 1.5 million people driven
from their homes? One hundred thousand men aged 15 to 55 missing?
The systematic rape? The mass graves? The executions? People forced
to bury their dead, and then murdered and thrown in on top?''
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, NATO diplomats said they believed the timing of the
announcement by the Yugoslav Army was aimed at stirring up
dissension among the European allies.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav Army ``statement suggests they're pulling out
because they've finished mopping up the KLA,'' said one senior NATO
diplomat, referring to the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. ``But the
KLA is actually in better shape than it was a month ago, so that
doesn't explain the statement. Milosevic is sowing the seeds of
dissension, pure and simple.''
</P>
<P>
   In other developments Monday:
</P>
<P>
   --NATO carried out daylight bombings on several towns in central
and western Serbia, killing four civilians and smashing a factory
in one 20-minute bombardment, Yugoslav media reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Tanjug news agency said seven missiles slammed into the
Serb-populated town of Kosovo Polje, site of the 1389 battle in
which the Serbs lost Kosovo to the Ottoman Turks. Tanjug said one
person was killed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the independent Beta news agency said NATO jets
struck a neighborhood of Kosovo's capital, Pristina, as well as the
city's airport _ a frequent target.
</P>
<P>
   --Yugoslavia began presenting its case to the World Court in The
Hague that NATO's bombing campaign is ``a crime against peace and
also the crime of genocide.'' NATO officials dismissed the suit as
hypocritical.
</P>
<P>
   --The United Nations reported that 15,000 refugees crossed the
Kosovo border into Albania over the weekend, bringing the estimated
number of refugees and displaced people to more than 745,000.
</P>
<P>
   --The European Union tightened sanctions against Yugoslavia,
freezing funds held within the union by people close to Milosevic
and banning the export of goods to Yugoslavia that could help
Belgrade repair facilities damaged by the NATO attacks.

SHEL SILVERSTEIN, 68, ENCHANTING POET FOR CHILDREN, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shel Silverstein, whose goofy, gross and macabre yet always
enchanting poetry for children sold more than 14 million books, was
found dead Monday morning at his home in Key West, Fla. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the time nor cause of death had been determined Monday
afternoon, said Shel Vidibor, his friend and lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   While Silverstein's talents led him into a diverse series of
careers as a cartoonist, playwright, singer and song writer, it was
his children's verses that are best known and often compared with
masters of the form like Dr. Seuss and A.A. Milne.
</P>
<P>
   His collections of children's poetry, ``Where the Sidewalk Ends:
The Poems and Drawings of Shel Silverstein'' (Harper, 1974) and ``A
Light in the Attic'' (Harper 1981), both enjoyed long runs on the
best-seller ists.
</P>
<P>
   Silverstein was also the author of the children's classic ``The
Giving Tree'' (Harper, 1964).
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his writings for children, he contributed
cartoons to Playbody magazine for many years and wrote nine plays
for adults. In 1988, when several of those plays were packaged as
``Wild Life'' and were produced at the Vanguard Theater in
Manhattan, Frank Rich, in his review in The New York Times,
suggested that playwrighting ``may eventually prove his most
fruitful career to date.''
</P>
<P>
   Silverstein's career as a children's author began in 1963 with
the publication of ``Uncle Shelby's Story of Lafcadio, the Lion Who
Shot Back'' (Harper).
</P>
<P>
   This yarn about a lion who acquired a hunter's gun and practiced
until he became a good enough shot to join the circus, was only a
moderate success. It was not until publication of ``The Giving
Tree,'' a story about a tree that surrenders its shade, fruit,
branches and finally its trunk to a boy in order to make him happy,
that Silverstein developed a mass following.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, when he published the collection of poems called
``Where the Sidewalk Ends,'' his work was compared to that of Dr.
Seuss and Edward Lear.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of silliness and sophisticated word play in
Silverstein's poetry is illustrated by the poem ``Eggs Rated'' in
the collection ``Falling Up'' (HarperCollins, 1997). Here, the
syllable ``ex'' is wittily replaced by ``egg,'' as in ``Eggstra
fluffy,/Eggstremely tasty/Cooked eggsactly right . . .'' But those
eggs are ``much more eggspensive than I eggspected.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the poems reflect a ghoulish taste that children
tolerate better than many adults. In the poem ``Safe,'' also in the
collection ``Falling Up,'' a child preparing to cross a street
carefully looks to one side and then the other before confidently
proceeding oblivious to a steel safe hurtling down from the
heavens.
</P>
<P>
   Silverstein, who maintained residences on Matha's Vineyard,
Mass.; Key West; Greenwich Village, and on a houseboat in
Sausalito, Calif., refused the grant interviews in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby Silverstein was born in Chicago in 1932, and backed his
way into publishing. ``When I was a kid _ 12 to 14, around there _
I would much rather have been a good baseball player or a hit with
the girls,'' he once told a reporter for Publishers Weekly. ``But I
couldn't play ball. I couldn't dance. Luckily, the girls didn't
want me. Not much I could do about that. So I started to draw and
to write. By the time I got to where I was attracting girls, I was
already into work, and it was more important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s Silverstein served with the United States armed
forces in Japan and Korea and began drawing cartoons for Stars and
Stripes, the American military publication.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to the United States, he began drawing cartoons
for Playboy magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from his cartoons, Silverstein began writing songs in the
country-western style. In 1969 one of these, ``A Boy Named Sue,''
was made a hit for the singer Johnny Cash. In 1980 Silverstein
recorded a country music album called ``The Great Conch Train
Robbery.''
</P>
<P>
   Silverstein is survived by his son, Matthew, and a sister, Peggy
Myers of Chicago.

CLINTON OPENS DIALOGUE OVER YOUTH VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w, e and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Careful not to blame youth violence on any one
cause, President Clinton opened a national conversation with an
eclectic group of leaders Monday on how to prevent another tragedy
like last month's student massacre in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The most substantive result of the three-hour White House
session was the launch of a national campaign and nonprofit
foundation aimed at curbing youth violence. But just as important,
the president said, was the sense from the meeting that gunmakers,
the media, and community political and religious leaders came
together committed to help parents raise healthier children.
</P>
<P>
   The president also challenged the entertainment industry to be
sensitive to and take responsibility for what he said was a
``coarsening of the culture'' and a movement away from creating a
positive image of American life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot pretend that there is no impact on our culture and
our children that is adverse if there is too much violence coming
out of what they see and experience,'' Clinton said in the Rose
Garden after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so we have to ask people who produce things to consider
the consequences of them, whether it's a violent movie, a CD, a
video game. If they are made, they at least should not be marketed
to children,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The presidents of CBS Television and ABC/Disney attended the
meeting, which was closed to the news media, as did the head of
America On-Line and the Recording Industry Association of America.
In all, 60 people strategized around a large, rectangular table in
the White House East Room, including singer Gloria Estefan, poet
Maya Angelou, and the Rev. Eugene Rivers of Boston. First Lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton and Vice President Al Gore and his wife,
Tipper, participated, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president attempted today to get out front on an issue
that needed some kind of presidential response in the aftermath of
the Littleton affair,'' Rivers said after the meeting. ``But
ultimately the initiative will be led by grass-roots activists who
don't confuse White House sessions with building a real-world
antiviolence movement that focuses on prevention, intervention, and
zero tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Five children opened the session with ``powerful stories of
their own experiences,'' said Bruce Reed, the White House domestic
policy adviser. Gore called it a wide-ranging discussion, as
panelists noted how everything from domestic violence to the
quality of after-school care, from the Internet to the availability
of guns impacts the behavior of young people.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the meeting some had expected to be an opportunity to
bash the gun lobby turned into one of considerable presidential
praise for two gun-trade groups _ the American Shooting Sports
Council and the National Shooting Sports Foundation Inc. _ that in
recent days tentatively endorsed what Clinton called ``common sense
measures'' to strengthen federal gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are proposals to raise the age to 21 from 18 for
legally possessing a handgun; require background checks for buyers
at gun shows; ban violent juveniles from ever buying a gun; expand
gun tracing nationally; and make parents legally liable for
allowing youngsters access to guns later used in crime.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association, the largest lobby of gun owners,
was not invited to send its president, actor Charlton Heston, to
Monday's White House meeting. Wayne LaPierre, the NRA's executive
director, said Clinton was afraid Heston would expose the
``complete collapse'' of the Justice Department's enforcement of
federal firearms laws during the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of dealing with (prosecutions), what we see is the
president now dusting off every tired old gun-control bill that's
been around his administration for the last six years ... tired old
schemes that have no real impact on this criminal culture of
violence in this country,'' LaPierre said. Monday the NRA began a
national advertising campaign aimed at affirming its support for
unfettered gun ownership for law-abiding Americans.
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre was joined at a news conference by Robert Delfay,
executive director of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, who
turned down an invitation to the strategy session because the White
House was ``trying to drive a wedge between the industry and the
National Rifle Association.'' Such a wedge, he said, ``does not
exist.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to begin debate Tuesday on a juvenile
crime bill that once was aimed at making violent juveniles stand
trial as adults but now is expected to become a vehicle for a
number of gun-control amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Monday Clinton said he has instructed Dr. David Satcher, the US
surgeon general, to prepare a report on youth violence that would
review existing research and particularly assess the impact of the
Internet and video games on youth behavior. The idea came from,
among others, Democratic Representative Edward J. Markey of
Massachuetts, who was also instrumental in legislation that makes
the V-Chip _ a device for allowing adults to block objectionable
programming _ mandatory in new television sets next year.
</P>
<P>
   A survey released Monday by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a
California-based research group, showed 80 percent of parents said
they had heard of the TV ratings now in use, but only 39 percent of
them said they had seen an explanation of them. Seventy-seven
percent said they would block shows they don't want their children
to watch if their television sets were equipped with such
technology, while 20 percent said they would not.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said that during the meeting, Gore praised ABC, CBS, and
most cable networks for rating children's programs and ``chided''
NBC for not taking part in the effort. Reed also said there were
``encouraging signs'' from the entertainment industry that it was
trying to ``galvanize efforts'' on the violence issue.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti, the film industry's longtime Washington lobbyist,
said, ``An increasing number of creative people in Hollywood are
willing to examine the issue of gratuitous'' violence. But, he
added, ``I do not know of a single piece of research that shows
somebody looked at Quake or Doom or looked at a movie and then
grabbed a Tec-DC9 and then went out and blew somebody's head off.''

U.S. LOSES HOLD ON SUBMARINE-EXPOSING RADAR TECHNIQUE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Va., Okla., Mass.)  (jw) 
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For two decades the Pentagon has tried to monopolize a space
radar that can expose submerged submarines.
</P>
<P>
   When the radar made its debut in 1978 with surprising powers of
discernment, military officials blocked public release of satellite
photos that showed deep, normally invisible wakes of speeding
craft. Last year, the military had the federal government set
strict limits on the visual powers of proposed commercial radar
satellites. And this year, the Pentagon is fighting a Canadian plan
to loft a radar satellite that would break the new American rules.
</P>
<P>
   Now it turns out, according federal officials, that an American
scientist gave radar secrets to China in 1997, forcibly easing the
Pentagon's grip. The implications of this disclosure are unclear,
because the size of the breach is unknown publicly and because the
secret method is reportedly difficult to put into practice, even
after years of study.
</P>
<P>
   But at worst, experts say, American subs are now in danger of
losing some of their cover. Among the vulnerable are missile subs,
the most important part of the nation's nuclear arsenal because of
their stealthiness.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, the unanswered questions include how deep submarines
must go to elude radar prying, how sea currents and temperatures
can help restore invisibility and how technical advances with
submarines, satellites and computers will most likely affect such
probing in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Today the radar technique is believed to be able to uncloak
submarines hundreds of feet beneath the waves, but not thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that recent trends have already hurt the Pentagon's
game, and that China's espionage, at least in theory, has made
things worse.
</P>
<P>
   A menacing trend is the advent of commercial radar satellites,
which sell their images to anyone with a credit card. Canada has
one in orbit and wants another, more powerful. An American company
is building one, though the strict new federal rules forced it to
limit its original goals.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the secrets that China got in 1997 could help it
hunt for foreign subs from commercial satellites, or from
airplanes. China, they add, could also use the secret knowledge to
better cloak its own submarines, finding ways to reduce the deep
wakes that produce subtle clues of stealthy movement.
</P>
<P>
   Angelo Codevilla, a professor of international relations at
Boston University who has worked on the staff of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, said the Chinese would most easily and
plausibly use the secrets to change the depth and speed of their
submarines.
</P>
<P>
   Secret knowledge of ``what we can and cannot do,'' he said,
could help the Chinese dodge submarine spying.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since the start of the space age, most satellites have observed
the Earth with cameras similar in principle to any tourist's. In
1978, however, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
launched a new kind of satellite that made images by bouncing radio
waves off the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Seasat, this radar craft saw land and sea in striking
new ways, its images revealing narrow lines in the ocean _ tracings
left by the passage of ships and subs. It somehow managed to
distinguish signs of deep turbulence from the regular froth and
heave of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Seasat's feats came to an abrupt end in 1978 when the spacecraft
failed unexpectedly after 100 days, with the Pentagon deeply
ambivalent about its discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was concern about what we had done,'' recalled Gene
Giberson, the project manager for Seasat at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Russians flew nuclear-powered radar satellites
to spy on the oceans, the Pentagon _ the Navy in particular _ was
loath to look closely at the phenomenon, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Navy resisted,'' said Dave McCurdy, a former chairman of
the House Intelligence Committee and an Oklahoma Democrat. ``They
didn't want questions raised. There is a certain orthodoxy they
didn't want challenged.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, in the early 1980s, Congress forced the issue,
setting up a research program independent of the Navy that had the
issue closely investigated. In 1988, inspired by Seasat, the
nation's spy agencies launched their first radar satellite.
</P>
<P>
   McCurdy, now president of the Electronic Industries Association,
in Arlington, Va., said the research program found deep-sub imaging
``an incredibly difficult challenge'' that, among other things,
required ``a lot of computing power.''
</P>
<P>
   However, progress was sufficient that Britain and the United
States kept up the investigations in the 1990s in a joint program.
Richard Twogood, the program's technical leader, based at Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, a weapons lab in California, told
Congress in 1994 of the discovery of phenomena that ``appear to be
very important to the sensing of surface effects produced by
undersea disturbances.''
</P>
<P>
   Twogood also complained that the Defense Department was
withholding funds for the research.
</P>
<P>
   It was he who told federal investigators that the radar
information given China by Peter Lee, an American scientist, was
``classified and sensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   A high-ranking Navy submariner said the force was ``not worried
about'' the Chinese espionage because the detection technology was
``still of such limited practical use.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Pentagon is facing not only Chinese spying but also
the global debut of commercial radar satellites, raising knotty
issues.
</P>
<P>
   RDL Space Corp., in Culver City, Calif., wanted a federal
license for a satellite with one-meter resolution, or about three
feet.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington, at the Pentagon's request, said the company
could sell imagery with resolution no greater than five meters, or
about 16 feet. Last June RDL won a federal license for that
sensitivity. It plans to launch its satellite in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Canada, however, is planning to overstep that boundary with a
radar satellite that has a resolution of three meters, or about 10
feet. Federal officials, at the Pentagon's request, are now trying
to talk Canada into a less sensitive aim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other agencies are looking at this,'' said Charles Wooldridge,
the head of satellite licensing at the Commerce Department. ``It's
a national security issue.''  &QL;

FOUR LIVES FOREVER AFFECTED BY THE FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT L. JAMIESON JR.  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For Samuel L. Jackson, the urge welled after he saw
``Star Wars'' in 1977. Teenager Natalie Portman had not seen a
single scene of the saga until opportunity knocked.
</P>
<P>
   Liam Neeson never envisioned a future in lightsabers but now he
wields a pretty green stick. There was no way Jake Lloyd, all of 10
years old, could say no to the chance of a lifetime: flying a space
fighter around the ol' Naboo-hood.
</P>
<P>
   Four actors. Four paths. They converged when the Force beckoned.
Now the quartet are members of George Lucas' exclusive club,
appearing in ``Star Wars: Episode One _ The Phantom Menace,'' which
hits more than 3,500 movie screens across the country May 19.
</P>
<P>
   Each actor, in his or her own way, is bracing for the
unavoidable tide of public recognition. Jackson is pumped about
getting a toy action figure in his likeness; Portman is
concentrating on advanced placement tests; Neeson, who is media
shy, would rather be out for trout; and Jake? Well, he and his
family already had to move once. That was after local kids started
camping in their front yard after Jake's mug appeared in the
movie's early trailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were insane,'' Jake recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, spending time in the Big Apple with the big stars before
the big day is like witnessing lives in calm _ and not so calm _
contemplation before a storm.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel L. Jackson
</P>
<P>
   The ambassador of cool strolls into a room and tells how he got
the phat Kangol beret with the words P-h-a-n-t-o-m M-e-n-a-c-e
printed on it. ``I got friends in high places,'' chortles Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Best-known for his role as the Bible-quoting hitman in ``Pulp
Fiction,'' Jackson plays Mace Windu, a member of the Jedi Council.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the late '70s, Jackson said he saw ``Star Wars'' and
decided, ``I should have been in it, and if they make another one I
needed to be in that one.'' The reason for his passion was
adventure; he saw the original flick as being like a ``'70s Errol
Flynn swashbuckling'' tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took 22 years to make it happen,'' Jackson said of his Jedi
mission, now accomplished. ``But we got it done.''
</P>
<P>
   His ``Phantom'' time is limited, although the buzz is there is a
place for Mace in the next installment. Until then, Jackson does
have a deal in hand: his own Mace Windu action figure. ``Looks
good, too,'' he jokes.
</P>
<P>
   His presence in the film brings a second prominent African
American actor _ Billy Dee Williams in the original trilogy was the
first _ to Lucas' universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like, `Where the brothers at?' (Are they) on their own
planet and just have not stopped by yet?'' Jackson says with a
guffaw, adding ``Does that mean there's a Colt 45 (beer)
commercial?''
</P>
<P>
   Natalie Portman
</P>
<P>
   The girl is smart. The girl is pretty. The girl has two worlds
on a string _ Earth and planet Naboo.
</P>
<P>
   In the first world, Portman does plays on Broadway and is
preparing to go to an Ivy League college. (She's keeping mum on
which one.)
</P>
<P>
   In the second world, she wears wonderfully ornate costumes,
displays strength and compassion and is known as Queen Amidala of
Planet Naboo.
</P>
<P>
   No matter which planet you find her on, she is going places.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this role is so wonderful because young girls don't
have that kind of role model in their life, or often reflected in
film,'' the vibrant 17-year-old high school senior says, smiling.
``Girls are losing a lot of confidence in themselves as the years
go on. They become much more worried about their looks rather than
their intelligence, and their personality and their kindness.''
</P>
<P>
   Portman's previous credits include the movie ``Beautiful Girls''
and Broadway's production of ``The Diary of Anne Frank.'' She had
not seen any of the ``Star Wars'' movies until Lucas offered her
the part. In the movie, her character, which has pivotal roles in
the next two films, must try and save Naboo from destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Portman said she enjoyed working with Lucas _ ``he's a genius''
_ and was amazed to see the beauty of the ornate regal outfits she
wore on the big screen. On the set, the crew made light fun of the
headdresses, including one that looked like a mushroom. ``We named
it `The Armadillo,' '' she laughs.
</P>
<P>
   As she waits for Lucas to finish the next script, she has more
acting gigs lined up, as well as school. This week and next, she
has advanced-placement tests in French, calculus, government,
macroeconomics and biology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really hate to go through life not knowing more,'' she says.
``Also, I've been acting for over five years. By the time I finish
college, it will be 10 years. I might be ready to move on by that
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Liam Neeson
</P>
<P>
   He'd rather be fishing. Upstate New York. Maybe Connecticut. Fly
rod in hand. Until then, Neeson will settle for a lightsaber on
Tatooine.
</P>
<P>
   Neeson plays Qui-Gon Jinn, a Jedi knight who takes Anakin
Skywalker under his wing.
</P>
<P>
   Neeson said he got into acting by good fortune. He had dropped
out of university in Belfast and was working on a forklift when he
called up a local theater that happened to be looking for someone
tall.
</P>
<P>
   ``What height are ye?'' a woman at the theater asked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six-foot-four,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you be here next Thursday?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   He showed up. And the rest, as they say, is history.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Neeson is standing tall in his profession, having been
nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of Oskar Schindler in the
acclaimed film ``Schindler's List.''
</P>
<P>
   He came to the ``Phantom Menace'' project after hearing that
Lucas planned to emerge from his ``mini-retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not really for `Star Wars,' it was for George Lucas. He
was always on my little wish list from `American Graffiti' days,''
Neeson said softly, tugging on the sleeve of his casual black sport
coat. ``He offered me the part. There was no script. It was a leap
of faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Neeson said he could identify with the serial's story line
because of the tradition of rich, mythic storytelling in his native
Ireland. ``King Arthur was as real to me as the strange man living
five doors up, ye know?'' said Neeson, whose first big-screen
credit was ``Excalibur.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother totally believes in fairies and goblins. She
could talk about those things the way you talk about the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   The well-toned actor said he does not miss the physical demands
of the ``Phantom Menace'' shoot, for which he had to do extra
push-ups just to stay in saber-fighting shape. Now, with the crush
of media building, he is looking to run away _ in his green
Converse Chuck Taylors _ to a river.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do want to go out and catch a 22-inch trout with my new dry
fly. It's called the Qui-Gon,'' he said, a smile breaking across
his face. ``It's the master Jedi of dry flies.''
</P>
<P>
   Jake Lloyd
</P>
<P>
   See Jake spin in the chair. Spin, Jake. Spin.
</P>
<P>
   Feel Jake throw a fed-up glance. Ouch, Jake. Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   Hear Jake tell a joke. Talk, Jake. Talk.
</P>
<P>
   I have a dog, Jake says. Charlie is his name. ``He's a Shitzu.''
</P>
<P>
   (A pause.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You might have to shorten that up.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone cracks up.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see why Portman and Neeson call Lloyd ``a sprite''
and expound on his energy. The 10-year-old is Grand Coulee Dam
breached.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, Lloyd plays Anakin Skywalker, who will grow up to
become Darth Vader. ``Whoa, Darth Vader rules,'' he says, spinning
again in a green chair.
</P>
<P>
   Jake has been acting half of his life. He is very excited to be
involved with the same director who catapulted another young ``Star
Wars'' actor to the big screen decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I haven't seen Mark Hamill in any other stuff,'' Jake
huffs, as he holds back a giggle. ``Either that or I'm not allowed
to see it!''
</P>
<P>
   Jake is saving up his movie money to buy a car, a nice home and
to go to college _ ``That's pretty much all I want'' _ but he can't
touch the moola, he says, until he is 18.
</P>
<P>
   He loves okra and black-eyed peas, the Stray Cats, and the baby
in the TV cartoon ``Family Guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and he hates to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank goodness (``The Phantom Menace'') is finally coming
out,'' he says ``Four years is a long while. For a kid, it's like
eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   But even fun times can turn serious. When people started camping
out in front of Lloyd's California home, his family decided it was
time to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not need that,'' said Jake's dad, Bill, adding that
other factors also played into the family's decision to go. (Jake's
sister, Madison, 7, also has a small role in the movie.)
</P>
<P>
   Jake Lloyd says he has fond memories of Lucas. ``Amazing
director. Nicest guy. He's the biggest, oldest kid I ever met _
well, besides my dad.''
</P>
<P>
   But wait! Tell me what happened to you and Lucas at the Chinese
restaurant?
</P>
<P>
   ``They had one of those spinning things in the middle of the
table,'' Lloyd begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I stopped it, everything spun off and a lot of it got on
George ...''
</P>
<P>
   Uh oh!
</P>
<P>
   ``... he just started laughing!''
</P>
<P>
   Phew!
</P>

SPORTS COLUMN: DARK SUITS, DARK DRESSES AND GLOWING WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Police vans, with blinking lights, blocked East 87th
Street from Park Avenue to Madison Avenue, but every so often a
long black limousine was allowed through the barricades. On the
shaded sidewalk, men in dark suits and women in dark dresses waited
in a slow-moving line to enter the Park Avenue Synagogue. Some of
the 1,500 mourners had arrived as much as two hours before the 11
a.m. funeral Monday for Leon Hess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for a policeman's funeral,'' a police officer was
saying, ``I've never seen a street shut off like this.''
</P>
<P>
   As a man of quiet dignity, Leon Hess would probably have been
embarrassed by all the attention, but deep down, he surely would
have enjoyed it. As he had basking in his Jets owner's box at
Giants Stadium during the closing minutes of the playoff victory
over the Jacksonville Jaguars last January.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved the fans, even the ones who had reviled him,''
Wellington Mara, the Giants' co-owner, would say in his eulogy.
``But now those same fans stood and cheered him. He gave them the
thumbs-up sign and said, `This is thrilling.' A provident God had
given him a sweet thrill before He took him from us.''
</P>
<P>
   But before Hess owned the Jets, he had built the Amerada Hess
Corp. into a worldwide oil business. And along with several Jets
coaches and players as well as a few National Football League club
owners, oil executives had come from Africa, South America and
Europe to sit in the synagogue's pews.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Kean, the former governor of New Jersey, remembered Hess'
reaction to Hurricane Hugo leveling much of St. Croix in the Virgin
Islands in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leon told me about the terrible damage to his oil refinery,''
Kean said, ``but then he told me there was even a worse loss, that
every school there had been destroyed and he said, `It's more
important that we rebuild the schools.' And he paid to rebuild
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop Theodore McCarrick of Newark told how Hess had
rebuilt other schools in the Caribbean that had been flattened by
another hurricane, and how Hess would phone him at Christmastime to
donate funds to help feed and buy presents for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leon Hess loved people,'' McCarrick said. ``He never took them
for granted. And when the Jets weren't winning, it's not that he
was disappointed for himself, but for the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Gutman, the Jets' president, remembered how Hess tested
the strength of the Hess toy trucks by standing on them. The day in
1993 when the Jets were hoping to woo Reggie White during his visit
as a free agent, Hess set a toy truck in front of the 300-pound
defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leon had Reggie take his coat off, then he said, `It's your
turn, Reggie,''' Gutman recalled. ``Reggie stood on it. The truck
is still there.''
</P>
<P>
   Those toy trucks, now a collector's item, were the symbol of
Hess' success in the oil business. His brother-in-law, Warren
Wilentz, remembered driving him to Newport News, Va., shortly after
World War II to inspect a Liberty ship that the federal government
no longer needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leon was a dreamer and he wanted to own a tanker,'' Wilentz
said. ``When we looked at that Liberty ship, I saw a dilapidated
piece of steel, but he saw his dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of Hess' grandchildren, Betsy Williams and Peter Friedland,
spoke fondly of him. So did his daughters, Connie Williams and
Marlene Zirin, and then his son, John, now the chief executive
officer of Amerada Hess, remembered how ``my father at first hauled
coal, but the 100-pound bags of coal were too heavy, so he went
into the fuel-oil business'' when fuel oil was 4 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a special love for the Jets,'' John Hess said. ``Please
know he will evaluate this season from another place.''
</P>
<P>
   Out on sunny East 87th Street now, pallbearers slid the
flag-draped coffin into the hearse, Norma Hess and the family
leaned into long black limousines for the ride to the New Jersey
cemetery, and familiar faces emerged from the synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Parcells, the Jets' football major domo, and two of the
Jets coaches that Hess dismissed, Rich Kotite and Joe Walton.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Namath, along with Super Bowl III teammates Winston Hill,
John Schmitt, Dave Herman and Ralph Baker. Marty Lyons, Bruce
Harper, Richard Caster and Ken Schroy from the Jets of two decades
ago. Vinny Testaverde, Keyshawn Johnson and Wayne Chrebet from the
reigning Eastern Division champions.
</P>
<P>
   And Dennis Byrd, a slight limp the only trace of his paralysis
from a 1993 helmet-to-helmet collision.
</P>
<P>
   `` Hess visited me in the hospital every night I was there,''
the former defensive end said. ``He taught me the values of
dedication, teamwork and loyalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Among all the dark suits and dark dresses was an older man in
shirt- sleeves, Saul Miller, who happened to be in the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a distributor of smoked fish,'' he said. ``I knew Hess in
passing from a friend of mine. He was a nice man. I'm trying to
find out where the Hess family will be sitting shiva. I want to
send over some bagels and lox.''
</P>
<P>
   Deep down, Leon Hess would have enjoyed that, too. &QL;

CLINTON OPENS DIALOGUE OVER YOUTH VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w, e and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Careful not to blame youth violence on any one
cause, President Clinton opened a national conversation with an
eclectic group of leaders Monday on how to prevent another tragedy
like last month's student massacre in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The most substantive result of the three-hour White House
session was the launch of a national campaign and nonprofit
foundation aimed at curbing youth violence. But just as important,
the president said, was the sense from the meeting that gunmakers,
the media, and community political and religious leaders came
together committed to help parents raise healthier children.
</P>
<P>
   The president also challenged the entertainment industry to be
sensitive to and take responsibility for what he said was a
``coarsening of the culture'' and a movement away from creating a
positive image of American life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot pretend that there is no impact on our culture and
our children that is adverse if there is too much violence coming
out of what they see and experience,'' Clinton said in the Rose
Garden after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so we have to ask people who produce things to consider
the consequences of them, whether it's a violent movie, a CD, a
video game. If they are made, they at least should not be marketed
to children,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The presidents of CBS Television and ABC/Disney attended the
meeting, which was closed to the news media, as did the head of
America On-Line and the Recording Industry Association of America.
In all, 60 people strategized around a large, rectangular table in
the White House East Room, including singer Gloria Estefan, poet
Maya Angelou, and the Rev. Eugene Rivers of Boston. First Lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton and Vice President Al Gore and his wife,
Tipper, participated, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president attempted today to get out front on an issue
that needed some kind of presidential response in the aftermath of
the Littleton affair,'' Rivers said after the meeting. ``But
ultimately the initiative will be led by grass-roots activists who
don't confuse White House sessions with building a real-world
antiviolence movement that focuses on prevention, intervention, and
zero tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Five children opened the session with ``powerful stories of
their own experiences,'' said Bruce Reed, the White House domestic
policy adviser. Gore called it a wide-ranging discussion, as
panelists noted how everything from domestic violence to the
quality of after-school care, from the Internet to the availability
of guns impacts the behavior of young people.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the meeting some had expected to be an opportunity to
bash the gun lobby turned into one of considerable presidential
praise for two gun-trade groups _ the American Shooting Sports
Council and the National Shooting Sports Foundation Inc. _ that in
recent days tentatively endorsed what Clinton called ``common sense
measures'' to strengthen federal gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are proposals to raise the age to 21 from 18 for
legally possessing a handgun; require background checks for buyers
at gun shows; ban violent juveniles from ever buying a gun; expand
gun tracing nationally; and make parents legally liable for
allowing youngsters access to guns later used in crime.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association, the largest lobby of gun owners,
was not invited to send its president, actor Charlton Heston, to
Monday's White House meeting. Wayne LaPierre, the NRA's executive
director, said Clinton was afraid Heston would expose the
``complete collapse'' of the Justice Department's enforcement of
federal firearms laws during the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of dealing with (prosecutions), what we see is the
president now dusting off every tired old gun-control bill that's
been around his administration for the last six years ... tired old
schemes that have no real impact on this criminal culture of
violence in this country,'' LaPierre said. Monday the NRA began a
national advertising campaign aimed at affirming its support for
unfettered gun ownership for law-abiding Americans.
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre was joined at a news conference by Robert Delfay,
executive director of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, who
turned down an invitation to the strategy session because the White
House was ``trying to drive a wedge between the industry and the
National Rifle Association.'' Such a wedge, he said, ``does not
exist.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to begin debate Tuesday on a juvenile
crime bill that once was aimed at making violent juveniles stand
trial as adults but now is expected to become a vehicle for a
number of gun-control amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Monday Clinton said he has instructed Dr. David Satcher, the US
surgeon general, to prepare a report on youth violence that would
review existing research and particularly assess the impact of the
Internet and video games on youth behavior. The idea came from,
among others, Democratic Representative Edward J. Markey of
Massachuetts, who was also instrumental in legislation that makes
the V-Chip _ a device for allowing adults to block objectionable
programming _ mandatory in new television sets next year.
</P>
<P>
   A survey released Monday by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a
California-based research group, showed 80 percent of parents said
they had heard of the TV ratings now in use, but only 39 percent of
them said they had seen an explanation of them. Seventy-seven
percent said they would block shows they don't want their children
to watch if their television sets were equipped with such
technology, while 20 percent said they would not.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said that during the meeting, Gore praised ABC, CBS, and
most cable networks for rating children's programs and ``chided''
NBC for not taking part in the effort. Reed also said there were
``encouraging signs'' from the entertainment industry that it was
trying to ``galvanize efforts'' on the violence issue.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti, the film industry's longtime Washington lobbyist,
said, ``An increasing number of creative people in Hollywood are
willing to examine the issue of gratuitous'' violence. But, he
added, ``I do not know of a single piece of research that shows
somebody looked at Quake or Doom or looked at a movie and then
grabbed a Tec-DC9 and then went out and blew somebody's head off.''

HBO ARTIST PORTRAIT LEAVES A LASTING IMPRESSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a business where depictions of strong, independent women lean
heavily on the assumption that they must also be slightly wacko _
see ``Ally McBeal,'' ``Felicity,'' ``Sports Night,'' etc. _ it's
refreshing and fun to find a female character who doesn't define
her self-worth by how she gets along with a man. Or with her
neuroses, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, Mary Cassatt is not appearing in a regular series right
now. All the more reason to check her out Tuesday night if you have
access to HBO. She's on in the second of six profiles of great
artists. These ``Artists' Specials,'' aimed at young viewers but
perfectly suitable for anyone interested in an uncomplicated,
well-intentioned story, follow the path of HBO's ``Composers'
Specials'' and ``Inventors' Specials.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of them have been keepers, but ``Mary Cassatt: American
Impressionist'' is worth a visit. It is the second in the artists'
series, coming after last month's ``Degas and the Dancer.'' It airs
again Saturday m., and May 19, May 23 and May 28.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Brenneman, who may have had the best female role ever handed
out by the testosterone-drenched cop show, ``NYPD Blue,'' plays
Cassatt with an individualistic spark that's reminiscent of her
spunky ``Blue'' character, Janice Licalsi. It's probably closer,
however, to the recurring Faye Moskowitz role she has been playing
on ``Frasier'' lately: an arty, independent woman devoted to her
family.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Cassatt was exactly that, and Brenneman's portrayal is
attractive and eminently convincing, especially when she tells her
niece, ``There's nothing wrong with being a single, independent
woman. You can be someone in your own right.''
</P>
<P>
   Producers of network TV series claim to be delivering this
message all the time, but it usually gets lost as comedy writers go
for the easy (and demeaning) sex joke and drama writers opt for the
standard woman-in-peril scenario. ``Mary Cassatt'' offers no such
clutter. Brenneman plays the American artist as an outspoken,
uncompromising woman who sees no shame in being far from home and
unattached at a time when the mission of ``marrying well'' is
uppermost in the minds of women who shared Cassatt's privileged
19th-century upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   Though inspired by actual events, the story involves a fictional
encounter between Cassatt and her mentor, the Impressionist painter
Edgar Degas (Thomas Jay Ryan), arranged by Cassatt's 14-year-old
niece, Katherine (Charlotte Sullivan). Katherine, herself smitten
with the son of her aunt's maid, hopes to ignite a spark of romance
in what she perceives to be the dull Parisian existence of her
eccentric aunt, whom she initially considers to be ``a rigid old
maid with no prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   While the American Cassatt and the Frenchman Degas would remain
friends and collaborators, the romance Katherine hopes for never
materializes. As Cassatt says in the film, her paintings are her
children, and far more important to her than being ``a pendant on
some man's arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Cassatt's individualistic tendencies rub off on
Katherine, helped in part when Louisa May Alcott pays a visit and
announces: ``No girl could be my friend if she refused to climb a
tree, and no boy could be my friend until I'd beaten him in a
race.''
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, the presence of Katherine and her siblings in
Cassatt's well-ordered world provides inspiration that surprises
and delights the artist.
</P>
<P>
   On its surface, ``Mary Cassatt: American Impressionist'' is a
well-crafted tale about the riches that accrue to people who treat
each other with mutual respect, no matter their ages. Underneath,
it's a deft treatise on the sources of creativity, and it leaves a
lasting impression.
</P>
<P>
   Odds 'n' ends
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of strong women, fans of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer''
won't want to miss Tuesday night's episode. Buffy (Sarah Michelle
Gellar) marries Angel (David Boreneaz). But only in her dreams. ...
And now on to Fine whines. The one-hour series finale of ``The
Nanny'' airs Wednesday. Hard to believe Fran Fine (Fran Drescher)
has been getting away with it for six seasons. Seems like 12. ...
The verdict on Monica Lewinsky's ``Saturday Night Live'' appearance
last weekend: She wasn't bad. Pretty good, actually. Certainly good
enough to secure a summer internship at NBC. ... Youth be served:
ABC will air a one-hour special on Teen People magazine's 21
hottest stars under 21. The date? The 21st, of course, at 8 p.m.
Among the profilees are Britney Spears, Brandy, Mya, Aaliyah, LeAnn
Rimes, Kirsten Dunst and three of the four hotties of ``Dawson's
Creek'': Michelle Williams, Joshua Jackson and Katie Holmes. ...
Reason to celebrate: The WB's ``Unhappily Ever After,'' possibly
the most heinous series on TV, airs its 100th _ and last _ episode
on May 23. ...

ABORTION STUDY FINDS SATISFACTION WITH CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Abortion, one of the most commonly performed, and apparently
safest, surgical procedures, also has a high rate of patient
satisfaction, according to a survey released Monday that gave
patients a rare chance to rate the quality of abortion care.
</P>
<P>
   According to the survey, by the Picker Institute, a Boston-based
nonprofit group that analyzes patient experiences, most women were
pleased with the care they received from abortion providers. The
study was funded by the Kaiser Family Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers interviewed women nationwide about waiting time,
pain control, and confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent of the 2,215 women surveyed rated their overall
care as ``excellent.'' Another third said their care was ``very
good'' or ``good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It confirms what we have been hearing from our patients: that
the quality of care is very important, and that they are
satisfied,'' said Pam Nourse, spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood
League of Massachusetts, which was among 12 abortion clinics whose
patients were surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the missing link in the story of abortion in
America,'' said Dr. David Grimes, former chief of abortion
surveillance for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The safety of the surgical procedure, Grimes said, has helped to
make legal abortion a public-health success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mainstream medicine now. I was born in the 1940s and
women were known to die of abortion complications in the US back
then,'' Grimes said. ``Today, the risk of dying from legal abortion
is less than dying from a shot of penicillin.'' For mothers, the
death rate is less than .001 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Phillip Stubblefield, chairman of the Boston Medical
Center's Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, said the Picker
report is important because abortion patients are often young
women, and thus ``it may be their first serious contact with
medical providers.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Picker study is about quality of care, access to
abortion was found to be the biggest issue facing those seeking the
procedure. From 1982 to 1996, the most recent period for which data
are available, the number of abortion providers declined in the
United States by 30 percent. Clinics specializing in abortion
perform about 70 percent of all of the procedures. Hospitals
provide only about 7 percent of them. Almost 1.4 million abortions
are performed annually in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Saporta, executive director of the National Abortion
Federation, said state legislatures are passing onerous laws that
serve only to restrict the ability of clinics to operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the kinds of things that do not add to the quality of
patient care, but just aim at increasing cost and making it
difficult for a clinic to stay open.''
</P>
<P>
   The Picker Institute president, Susan Edgman-Levitan, said the
study was a challenge to design because of the stigma attached to
abortion. Women, for example, were concerned that participating in
the survey might compromise their personal safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never heard that from any other patients we've
interviewed. People who have heart surgeries don't worry about
other people finding out that they had that procedure,''
Edgman-Levitan said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the report found a high quality of satisfaction with
the care the women received, 21 percent wanted more privacy in the
recovery room out of a fear of being recognized by others.
</P>
<P>
   Pain control was rated as adequate by 91 percent of the women,
but one in five reported feeling more pain than they had expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice if 100 percent said they were reasonably
comfortable,'' said Stubblefield, who added that his goal is to
avoid using general anesthesia, while still keeping women
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``General anesthesia is actually more dangerous than a
first-trimester abortion,'' Stubblefield said.

 &HT;    Refugees have health tested in U.S.
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chronic heart problems and the heartache of war and loss are
some of the health conditions found among the first two waves of
ethnic Albanian refugees from Kosovo at Fort Dix, N.J., where they
are staying before resettling in American cities.
</P>
<P>
   Ten refugees were admitted to New Jersey's Burlington Memorial
Hospital, said Lisa Swenarski, a spokeswoman for the Department of
Health and Human Services, which is coordinating the federal
government's Kosovo refugee operation.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people admitted had chronic heart or lung problems
that had worsened because they had no medication while fleeing from
their Kosovo homes and while staying in primitive refugee camps in
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   One young woman was admitted to the hospital's psychiatric ward.
She ``had witnessed her father and other family members being
killed,'' Swenarski said.
</P>
<P>
   Swenarski, normally a press liaison with the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta, is among many federal workers
temporarily reassigned to the Fort Dix effort, dubbed Operation
Provide Refuge. President Clinton has vowed to take in 20,000
ethnic Albanian residents of Kosovo who have fled the Yugoslav
province after Serb threats and attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees will be given months of federal medical and housing
assistance and will be eligible to stay in the United States if
they choose.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires all refugees to undergo a thorough physical
work-up, including blood work and chest X-rays. They are being
checked for contagious diseases, such as tuberculosis,
sexually-transmitted diseases and HIV. No positive cases of these
diseases have been reported. If found, those three diseases can be
grounds for the INS not to admit refugees; however, a waiver can be
granted when the person receives treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the crowded, squalid conditions in refugee camps
along the Macedonian and Albanian borders, numerous cases of lice
and scabies were anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they're fairly healthy, and if they do need treatment for
ulcers or lice, we can take care of that right here with the
pharmacy,'' said Dr. Susan Cookson, who heads the CDC's Migration
Health Assessment Office.
</P>
<P>
   Since Wednesday, 859 refugees have been received at Fort Dix,
and another plane load of 422 was scheduled to arrive Monday
afternoon. The base has capacity to handle 3,000.

PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS WOOING HIGH-TECHNOLOGY EXECUTIVES, AND VICE
VERSA 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Vice President Al Gore makes a point in his Seattle
visits of stopping at Internet companies like Amazon.com, the
on-line commerce pioneer. Other presidential hopefuls, including
Sen. John McCain, Rep. John Kasich and former Sen. Bill Bradley,
have recently toured Microsoft's campus here.
</P>
<P>
   So far Gov. George Bush of Texas has not come near either
Seattle or San Francisco's Silicon Valley. But that did not stop a
group of high-technology executives from taking out a newspaper
advertisement in The San Jose Mercury News last month, calling Bush
one of the ``visionary leaders who understand the New Economy'' and
urging him to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   The dance is on between presidential candidates and
high-technology executives, who were once regarded as bit players
in campaign finance and whose industry in turn famously prided
itself on its libertarian streak and almost dismissive attitude
toward whatever was happening in Washington, D.C. Facing a host of
tax and regulatory issues, and with the landmark Microsoft
antitrust case serving as a powerful reminder that federal
officials can still sway the competitive landscape, many industry
executives are clearly deciding that it pays to have friends in the
White House and Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has long sought to position himself as the
administration's champion of high technology and the Internet, has
extensive contacts in the industry and pulled in roughly $400,000
last month at a Silicon Valley fund-raiser given by John Doerr, a
founder of Technology Network, widely known as Technet, the prime
lobbying and fund-raising organization of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's competitor for the Democratic nomination, Bradley,
who spent a year as a visiting professor at Stanford University in
which he nursed his own Silicon Valley contacts, has also done
well, taking in about $1 million at a large San Francisco
fund-raiser last month that was well-populated with industry
executives.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush, though pledged to stay in Texas until the end of the
legislative session this spring, is planning a big San Francisco
Bay Area fund-raiser for late June. Among those who signed the
recent pro-Bush newspaper advertisement, which praised the
Republican Bush for ``creating an environment that stresses
personal responsibility over government intervention, and
innovation over regulation,'' were James Barksdale, founder of
Netscape; Bob Herbold, chief operating officer of Microsoft Corp.;
Jeff Henley, chief financial officer of Oracle Corp., and Steve
Behm, a vice president of Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   It is still early in the campaign cycle, but it is already
certain that computer-industry donations will be a bigger factor in
the 2000 elections than they have been in previous elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless high-tech people unplug their telephones, sign off
E-mail and leave the country in the next 18 months, they're going
to give more than they've ever given before,'' said Larry Makinson,
executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a
nonpartisan research group that tracks campaign finances. ``They're
certainly being hit up like never before.''
</P>
<P>
   High-technology-industry contributions to 1998 congressional
campaigns totaled about $8.1 million, more than twice as much as in
the 1994 campaigns. Even as industry contributions will continue to
grow in 2000, they probably still will be well below the dollars
spent by other industries, like energy and banking, that have had
large lobbying and campaign-donation operations in place for a long
time.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, whose total campaign contributions in 1998, $1
million, were more than triple its 1996 contributions, according to
the Center for Responsive Politics, is planning to have a major
presence in the 2000 campaign. (The contributions include
individual giving by company employees, political action committee
donations and so-called ``soft money,'' which is given to the
political parties rather than the candidates.)
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokesman, Greg Shaw, said the company acknowledged
it was ``a little slow in recognizing the importance of being a
more visible and more active participant in Washington,'' but now
was intent on ``sharing its views and experience'' with policy
leaders there.
</P>
<P>
   For the presidential aspirants, the booming industry is not just
an obvious source of money. It is also the creator of technology
that the candidates are intent on understanding, since it could be
vital to their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The number of American households with Internet access has
doubled to nearly 44 million since the last presidential election,
according to Forrester Research Inc., a company that monitors
technology trends. Candidates are already trying to use the World
Wide Web to attract voters, with sites that offer video clips,
questionnaires and invitations for visitors to ``get involved'' by
volunteering to work for the campaign, donating money or at least
signing up for regular E-mail updates.
</P>
<P>
   For the high-technology executives, there is a growing array of
reasons to want good friends in Congress or the White House. They
have already won legislation creating a moratorium on taxes for
Internet commerce, special visas for skilled foreign workers and an
extension of tax credits for research and development, though they
have had only minor success so far in measures to limit lawsuits
for problems related to the year 2000 computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, while the more established interests in the relatively
young computer industry, like Microsoft and America Online, are
getting increasingly involved in the political process, many newer
Internet companies and their top executives do not show significant
signs of doing so, even as their stock prices have climbed so high
that their market value has eclipsed that of huge companies in
other industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're Amazon.com,'' said Wade Randlett, Democratic
political director of Technet, the industry group, ``you're a new
company and you're trying to grow at 50 percent a quarter and your
competitors are trying to kill you _ that just doesn't allow you to
devote a lot of time to anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Amazon.com, Bill Curry, said the company had
recently designated a person on the legal staff to monitor
public-policy issues related to the Internet, and was evaluating
whether Amazon.com needed to do a better job of establishing
contact with public officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to avoid the mistake of being so focused on building a
business that some day we find out we need relationships in
Washington and we don't have any,'' Curry said.
</P>
<P>
   Calculating the precise impact the high-technology industry is
having on the 2000 campaign is difficult. The most recent filings
with the Federal Election Commission, for instance, show
contributions by individuals through March 31 and do not reflect
big fund-raisers held by both Gore and Bradley in the Bay Area last
month.
</P>
<P>
   The commission reports show Gore with about $83,000 in direct
contributions from executives at high-technology companies, but
they do not show the roughly $400,000 he pulled in at the
fund-raiser given by Doerr, a leading industry venture capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   Many computer companies, which had minimal presence in
Washington in past years, have set up political action committees
for corporate giving, which are expected to make major
contributions to candidates or to the national parties as the
campaign heats up.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while many computer companies applaud the federal
lawsuit against Microsoft, in which a ruling is expected this
summer, and thus may have a reason to reward Gore, the case is also
a powerful reminder that the federal government has the potential
to wield enormous power in shaping the industry, all the more
reason for computer executives to take an interest in campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   As Microsoft has become far more active in both making campaign
contributions and deploying lobbyists, and tried to fend off a
lawsuit pushed by a Democratic administration, there is no question
that the Republican Party has benefited.
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of the company's total contributions last year
went to Republicans. In 1992, just 20 percent of the company's
donations went to that party.
</P>
<P>
   And Republican presidential candidates, including McCain and
Kasich, have traveled to Microsoft recently to meet with top
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives said that the company was ``steadfastly
bipartisan'' and that increases on the Republican side were
attributable to the party's having taken control of Congress in
1994. Across the industry in general, many executives are not
particularly partisan, meaning that either party could make
inroads.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything else, Silicon Valley is on the 50-yard-line
of the political spectrum,'' said Randlett of Technet. ``It's
strongly free-market, free trade, pro-economic growth. And it's
pro-choice, pro-public education and pro-environment, with the same
if not greater fervor than the belief in free-market philosophy.
Whichever candidate is most centrist is going to do best here.''

 &HT;    Conference for technology-related business owners wraps up
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. _ Short of sticking ``.com'' at the end of his
company's name, software billionaire Jim Goodnight didn't stand a
chance at Monday's Internet-crazy technology conference.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive of Cary, N.C.-based SAS Institute Inc.
forecast that the nation's largest privately held software producer
would ring up sales of $1 billion this year. The 14.8 percent gain
over 1998 seemed shabby by Internet standards, Goodnight
acknowledged. SAS makes analysis and management software systems
that can run on a variety of platforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want a really great company, you want one on the Web
and losing millions of dollars,'' he said. ``Then you've got a
winner.''
</P>
<P>
   The laughter died down, but the Internet frenzy only gained
momentum at the Upside Southeast Technology Conference, a gathering
of gung-ho startups, technology powerhouses and ventures
capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth annual conference, which attracted more than 500
people, ends today at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   In a tribute to soaring internet stock prices and explosive
growth in electronic commerce, entrepreneurs, investment bankers
and academics predicted a bonanza for companies tied to Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Doubling every 100 days, Internet traffic is forecast to reach
more than 50 percent of U.S. households by 2003, compared with 28
percent today. Forrester Research forecasts that Internet commerce,
valued at $7.8 billion last year, will soar to $1.4 trillion over
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running a business without a connection to the Internet will
be like trying to run a business without a telephone,'' said
Georgia Tech telecom professor John Limb, one of several Atlantans
attending the Durham, N.C., conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the hype phase of the Internet right now,'' he said.
``We are going to enter the quiet era in four or five years, if not
sooner, when people do not talk about the Internet because it is
just part of doing business.'' A panel of experts resisted the
suggestion that the Internet bubble might soon burst, especially if
the rapid-fire succession of initial public offerings (including a
half dozen or more in the next two weeks) drains investor demand.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Moran, chief executive of Durham-based KOZ inc., a
supplier of e-commerce and other Web services, said he wasn't
worried that companies are pouring billions of dollars into
Internet ventures, including many that aren't yet profitable.
</P>
<P>
   He said companies are investing in a ``cyber infrastructure,''
which he compared to the turn-of-the-century construction of
transcontinental railroad tracks by investors who had to sell bonds
to finance the projects. Just as rail service transformed
transformed America's transportation, so will the Internet reshape
business, Moran said.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that profits will increase as companies which are
currently expanding rapidly to capture market share on the Internet
eventually slow their growth and focus on the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Yobie Benjamin, a global Internet and e-commerce strategist for
Ernst &AMP; Young, tried to make financial sense of the high stock
valuations of historically unprofitable companies. He suggested
that such companies be valued by a combination of traditional
variables, such as revenues and assets, and the potential for
companies to excel in innovation, flexibility and execution.
</P>
<P>
   The method is helpful both in justifying existing stock prices
and predicting future gains, Benjamin said. But in one of the
conference's few sobering remarks, he added, ``I cannot predict how
(the method) will work in a bear market.''

<P>
   LICE, Turkey _ In what must be one of the most tightly
controlled towns in the world, it was perhaps understandable that a
young man in the billiards parlor wanted to talk only about the
weather.
</P>
<P>
   As a fragrant breeze from the mountains brought an end to a
glorious spring day, the man said quietly, ``Weather is very bad
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed for an explanation, he said, ``We speak with our eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   At a cafe around the corner, an older man said: ``You can see
us, but you can't hear us. Our lips are sealed.'' At that moment,
two plainclothes police officers sat down at the table, and all
conversation ceased.
</P>
<P>
   Lice (pronounced LEE-jay) is a legend in Turkey, a rumor, a
place few have ever visited, but many believe they know. It was
here that the Kurdistan Workers Party was founded in 1978 and went
on to launch an uprising that has cost the lives of more than
30,000 soldiers, rebels and civilians. To this day it remains a
symbol of Kurdish militancy.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, when the surrounding area was largely
controlled by guerrillas, the army began a fierce campaign to
recapture it. Soldiers razed the outlying villages, which they
suspected of being guerrilla havens, and burned forests in which
guerrillas had found refuge.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, under circumstances that remain unclear, the town was
virtually burned to the ground. Much has been rebuilt. But in the
wreckage of desolate blocks it is still possible to find strangely
shaped pieces of glass that melted together in the inferno.
</P>
<P>
   Today 10 percent of the 10,000 people who lived in Lice a decade
ago remain. The rest have left for other places. They have been
partly replaced by refugees from destroyed villages, making the
total 6,000.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually everyone who lives here is Kurdish, except for the
large number of soldiers and security officers who patrol the
streets with guns that bulged from their belts. Most male residents
refused to serve in the village guard, a paramilitary force that is
supposed to help defend towns against guerrilla attacks, but were
ordered to do so under the threat of imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   The political and ethnic conflict here is as stark as anywhere
in Turkey. Residents say they are Kurds, and the authorities are
determined to make Turks out of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They saw this place as some kind of temple, and they wanted to
destroy it,'' said a man who, like every other civilian encountered
here, refused to give his name. ``Now the town is like an open
prison. We can't talk and we can't move without being watched. But
we still feel free, because real freedom comes from inside you.''
</P>
<P>
   In an election campaign last month, the military and police
officials who rule here warned people not to vote for the mayoral
candidate of the People's Democracy, the pro-Kurdish party that
prosecutors say is an arm of the guerrilla movement. Campaigning
for People's Democracy was effectively forbidden, and its
candidate, Zeynal Bagir, was not allowed to return after he left
for what he thought would be a quick trip several weeks before the
election. Nonetheless, he won an overwhelming victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about identity,'' a man attending a wedding party in a
field on the edge of town said. ``We showed that we exist. It was
all we could do. The world knows our situation. We can't speak. In
fact, right now I see the security police watching, and since they
don't want us to talk to you, I say goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   The distribution of basic foodstuffs, like sugar and flour, is
controlled by the police here. They allot a limited quantity to
each family, fearing that if free sales were allowed, people would
buy extra and smuggle it to guerrillas. Families believed to have
supported People's Democracy in the election have had their rations
cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us, `You voted for that party, so let that party
give you your flour,''' said a youth who was leaning against a car.
</P>
<P>
   Lice has one main street. There are a half-dozen cafes where
unemployed men spend much of the day sipping tea and smoking. A
larger-than-life statue of the founder of the Turkish Republic,
Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, stands on a platform bearing the admonition,
``The nation is one and cannot be divided.''
</P>
<P>
   At a grocery store, a Kurdish woman evidently on a suicide
mission blew herself up and injured nine others this year.
</P>
<P>
   Lice is under a strict curfew, and after 8 p.m. the only sound
outside comes from armored personnel carriers that rumble through
the streets, searchlights probing the darkness and men at the ready
behind machine guns.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said, however, that conditions were better than they
were a few years ago. They may be worse in Tunceli, 50 miles
northwest of here, another town known as a hotbed of Kurdish
nationalism. Journalists are forbidden to enter Tunceli.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are still regular clashes in this region of Turkey. Six
soldiers were killed when their jeep ran over a mine south of here
on Friday night, and 10 guerrillas were reportedly killed soon
afterward. On that night, a sniper shot another soldier dead. But
the guerrilla force, whose leader, Abdullah Ocalan, was captured
this year, enjoys nowhere near the military power that it once had.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are much better than when I got here three years ago,''
the security chief of Lice, Hasrettin Bayraktar, said. ``We lost a
lot of people to migration. But not many are leaving now. We have a
factory here. People are free to farm their land. When people don't
work they get bad ideas in their heads. But now that there are more
jobs, fewer people are thinking like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bayraktar and his officers insisted that Lice was all but
pacified. One officer assigned to follow foreigners seemed offended
when asked to keep his distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are you afraid to ask questions when we are around?'' he
asked. ``We are completely integrated with the people here. There
is no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But even when people speak privately, they choose their words
carefully. Asked whether soldiers and security officers considered
everyone in Lice a terrorist or potential terrorist, one man
replied, ``That's the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps inevitably, those who spoke most freely were children.
Asked whether he was afraid of the police, an 8-year-old replied,
``Of course we are, because if they arrest you they either torture
you or kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   At that, a 15-year-old who seemed unusually mature interrupted
to say: ``Don't ask too much. Don't make us say too much. Otherwise
it's trouble for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   To the suggestion that he should consider running for mayor when
he turns 18, the boy replied, ``In this town you don't even know if
you will be alive in three years.''

EXILED ALBANIAN LEADER SUPPORTS NATO POSITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Dismissing Yugoslavia's assertion Monday that it would
withdraw some of its forces from Kosovo as ``unverifiable,'' the
moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova made his clearest statement
yet that he fully supports NATO's position in the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is true, OK, but first we have to verify it,'' Rugova
said in an interview with reporters Monday in Rome. He referred to
the overture by President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, which
has been rejected by American and NATO leaders as inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I am asking for is, first, the installment of an
intervention force there, NATO and Russian, that can check the
withdrawal of Serbian forces and begin letting refugees back in,''
Rugova said. ``Belgrade has to accept that first.''
</P>
<P>
   Rugova is an Albanian intellectual who was long the voice of
passive resistance to Serbian control of its Kosovo province, where
90 percent of the prewar population was Albanian. But he has been
something of an enigma since the NATO bombing campaign began.
</P>
<P>
   Before the war, he was a respected voice of moderate opposition
to Milosevic's policies. When the bombing began he remained in
Kosovo, and statements attributed to him by the Yugoslav news media
led NATO to declare him a hostage under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   His hard-line separatist rivals in the rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army were less sympathetic, though, and called him a traitor.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova left for Italy last week with his wife and children. He
had until Monday been reserved about the circumstances under which
he had remained in his house in the Kosovo capital, Pristina, now a
decimated city under Yugoslav control.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, surrounded and at times overshadowed by Italian
politicians and Catholic lay workers who helped secure his release
from Yugoslavia, he seemed meek and reticent in his new exile in
Rome, a hostage not to Serbian hostility but to European
hospitality. At a meeting in the Vatican on Monday, Rugova, a
Muslim, bent and gratefully kissed the pope's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he said that Yugoslav efforts to paint him as a willing
collaborator with Yugoslavia who opposed the bombing campaign were
``false and propaganda.'' He also said he endorsed the NATO
conditions for a halt in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   And while he again declined to speak specifically about the
conditions under which he had lived for the last six weeks he spent
in Pristina, he made it clearer that he had been under considerable
pressure not to reveal his true feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his position that Yugoslavia must accept NATO
conditions before the bombing can be ended, he said: ``I said all
that in my house, but there were no journalists there except
Serbian journalists. My friends in the West know me, but you have
to understand the conditions in Pristina. I was there with my
family. I ask for a little bit of human understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that rebel leaders had also deliberately misrepresented
his position. ``What they are saying about me is stupid and
propaganda _ it's not serious,'' he said, ``and it's tragic today
to talk like that at a time when millions of Kosovars are in
exile.''
</P>
<P>
   Rugova said he would nevertheless seek to unite the squabbling
Albanian factions. ``Despite all that, I will try to bring those
boys in Tirana together and do something to get us organized to
focus on rebuilding a political structure in Kosovo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova, who views himself as the eventual spokesman for Kosovo
Albanian interests if and when negotiations with the Yugoslav
government begin, repeatedly said that he did not want to discuss
the pressure he was under in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   But it was clear that in other ways, he was yearning to talk
about his ordeal. Discussing his plans to go to Paris and London to
meet with European leaders, he referred to the recent weeks in
Pristina, with only his immediate family around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back there, I was alone,'' he said. ``I was alone with
animals. They came close to my house _ cats, cows.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came because they needed to be near a human being.'' He
added softly, ``Pristina is a ghost town _ it's unbelievable.''

US OFFERS DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE OF KOSOVO `CLEANSING' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With attention riveted on the possibility of a
rupture in big-power relations over the Chinese embassy bombing,
the US State Department Monday put forward its first attempt to
document Serb atrocities in Kosovo, which Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said had made the Yugoslav bombing necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which officials said went to press before last
Friday's embassy bombing and ``has nothing to do with the Chinese
situation,'' listed slightly more than 3,000 alleged executions of
Kosovar Albanians by Serbs. About 10 percent of the reported
incidents were based on the accounts of single witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The 3,000 figure compares with 800,000 killed in ethnic
slaughter in Rwanda in 1994 and about 1.5 million slain in Cambodia
in the late 1970s. The 700,000 refugees who so far have fled Kosovo
compares with about 2 million who fled a similar war in neighboring
Bosnia, where organized rape took place on a greater scale than
anything yet described in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO ``has done everything it can to avoid civilian
casualties'' and regrets the embassy bombing, Albright said,
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's ``military campaign is
directed first and foremost at civilian targets'' _ an assertion
she said was proven by the report.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador David Scheffer, the lead US official on war crimes
issues, said ``what has occurred in Kosovo, with the possible
exception of Rwanda in 1994 and Cambodia in 1975, is truly
unprecedented with respect to the degree and ferocity and the short
time span with which an assault on a civilian population has taken
place. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``The important point,'' Scheffer said, ``is: Is the
political-military response to the human rights crisis and the
humanitarian crisis warranted?'. . . What this report recounts is
the scale and intensity of the crime and the need for strong action
to oppose it.''
</P>
<P>
   In later questioning, State Department spokesman James Rubin
sharply defended Scheffer's assertion, asserting that the Kosovo
persecutions were unrivaled for the speed with which so many
refugees had been put to flight. He said that ``this is just the
beginning of the process of learning how many people died,'' and
revived a claim made early in the war, but not heard recently, that
100,000 men are ``missing.''
</P>
<P>
   US and NATO officials have suggested the men could be either
dead or in concentration camps, but have produced no evidence or
witness accounts so far of deaths or detentions on that scale. The
largest suspected detention camp listed in the report Monday
reportedly contains 5,000 ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the ranks of officialdom, there is growing concern at
the way the United States and NATO are invoking the plight of the
refugees and demonizing Serbs in general and Milosevic in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we make one of these major mistakes, we say `Oh,
those poor refugees,' '' said Uri Ra'anan, director of Boston
University's Institute for the Study of Conflict, Ideology and
Policy. ``Each time, we say the bombing will continue, possibly at
an accelerated rate, and then we throw in, `and look at those
refugees.' How many times are we going to do this before the public
gets wise to the fact that this is all going very badly?''
</P>
<P>
   Ra'anan said the use of the refugees to justify policy is
blocking Congress and the media from attempting unsentimental
appraisals of how the campaign against Milosevic's forces is going,
and whether the assumptions on which the assault on Yugoslavia was
launched remain valid. He particularly bristled at assertions by
defenders of the policy equating events in Kosovo with the
genocides in Rwanda and Cambodia, or suggesting a similarity to the
Nazi Holocaust in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are using this know it is absurd nonsense,'' he
said of the analogy.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Nye, dean of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and
assistant secretary of defense earlier in the Clinton
administration, said a danger of making absolutist accusations
against Milosevic and the Serbs is that such demonization could
make it hard for NATO nations to accept a resolution of the
conflict that falls short of displacing the Serb leader and
militarily defeating his forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic is not Hitler,'' Nye said. ``Milosevic has done some
very bad things; the Serbs have done some very bad things,'' but
they are only worse by degrees than other forces in the region
which did not suffer armed attacks from NATO or the United States.
He noted specifically that the US said little about the
Croat-Muslim struggle that decimated the historic and beautiful
city of Mostar, and nothing about ethnic cleansing committed by
Croats against Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Ra'anan also cautioned that using the plight of the Kosovar
Albanians and refugees to justify use of force dramatically changes
the definition of NATO as an alliance to defend its own members and
friendly sovereign allies.
</P>
<P>
   Displacement of Albanians was occurring mainly within Kosovo
until the bombing started, he said, ``and if the US can intervene
on behalf of the ethnic Albanians'' in this way, ``couldn't the
Russians use these same arguments to rationalize intervening in
behalf of ethnic Russians in Latvia and Estonia? We have created a
terrible precedent.''

EMERGENCY SPENDING REQUEST INCLUDES JET LEASES FOR GENERALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An urgent request from the Air Force is buried in
the multibillion-dollar emergency bills that will finance NATO's
air war in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Smart bombs? F-16 fighters?
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. The Air Force wants to lease Gulfstream executive
business jets to ferry four-star generals around the world. The
cost could run to half a billion dollars over a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The aging 707s that transport nine of the nation's top military
commanders simply won't do, the brass complains. They want the
top-of-the-line Gulfstream V. The planes can fly eight passengers
non-stop for 7,500 miles, wrapping them in sweet silence and
comfort, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force already has two Gulfstream Vs for the very highest
government officials. Moguls from the movies and Microsoft fly
them. Why not the military's most powerful commanders, men like
Gen. Wesley Clark, now running NATO's air war?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a hot issue,'' said a congressional staff member
working on the Senate's still-evolving emergency bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to look like you're buying the CINCs executive
jets,'' he said, referring to the military's nine unified and
regional commanders-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   So the Pentagon and the Senate Appropriations Committee
chairman, Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, worked out a deal that would
let the Air Force lease six Gulfstreams for the commanders,
congressional staff members said.
</P>
<P>
   The new fleet would give them ``the capability to travel within
the full length of their theaters or to Washington, D.C., without
an en route stopover,'' the Air Force said in a fact sheet
submitted to Congress two weeks ago to underscore the commanders'
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the nine commanders, Clark, is actually based
overseas. The other regional and unified commanders work in
Virginia, Illinois, Colorado, Nebraska, Hawaii and Florida, where
three of them have headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   But with the United States playing the role of the world's sole
superpower, their responsibilities are global, the Pentagon
contends.
</P>
<P>
   Those who support the request _ none of whom would be quoted by
name _ say leasing conceivably could be cheaper than maintaining
the Boeing 707s. And the Gulfstreams cost less than the planes some
of the commanders originally sought: a fleet of Boeing 767s, which
run upwards of $100 million apiece. One new Gulfstream was included
in this year's Pentagon budget.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Gulfstream V can only carry a small contingent.
So the Air Force says it might also go for two Gulfstreams and four
specially equipped 737-700s, which carry at least 126 passengers in
their commercial configuration.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's emergency spending bill includes a measure aiding
Central American hurricane victims, which is where the leasing
arrangement actually originated. It goes to conference Tuesday with
the $13 billion measure passed by the House last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Gulfstream measure includes only the legal authority to sign
a lease _ no money. It doesn't mention the money at all.
</P>
<P>
   But the leasing deal, if carried out, could cost $476 million or
more over 10 years, according to Air Force documents and
congressional staff members.
</P>
<P>
   It would actually cost less to buy each of the nine commanders
his very own personal Gulfstream V _ $333 million. But then it
would look like Congress was buying the commanders the jets.

CLINTON OPENS DIALOGUE OVER YOUTH VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w, e and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Careful not to blame youth violence on any one
cause, President Clinton opened a national conversation with an
eclectic group of leaders Monday on how to prevent another tragedy
like last month's student massacre in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The most substantive result of the three-hour White House
session was the launch of a national campaign and nonprofit
foundation aimed at curbing youth violence. But just as important,
the president said, was the sense from the meeting that gunmakers,
the media, and community political and religious leaders came
together committed to help parents raise healthier children.
</P>
<P>
   The president also challenged the entertainment industry to be
sensitive to and take responsibility for what he said was a
``coarsening of the culture'' and a movement away from creating a
positive image of American life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot pretend that there is no impact on our culture and
our children that is adverse if there is too much violence coming
out of what they see and experience,'' Clinton said in the Rose
Garden after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so we have to ask people who produce things to consider
the consequences of them, whether it's a violent movie, a CD, a
video game. If they are made, they at least should not be marketed
to children,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The presidents of CBS Television and ABC/Disney attended the
meeting, which was closed to the news media, as did the head of
America On-Line and the Recording Industry Association of America.
In all, 60 people strategized around a large, rectangular table in
the White House East Room, including singer Gloria Estefan, poet
Maya Angelou, and the Rev. Eugene Rivers of Boston. First Lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton and Vice President Al Gore and his wife,
Tipper, participated, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president attempted today to get out front on an issue
that needed some kind of presidential response in the aftermath of
the Littleton affair,'' Rivers said after the meeting. ``But
ultimately the initiative will be led by grass-roots activists who
don't confuse White House sessions with building a real-world
antiviolence movement that focuses on prevention, intervention, and
zero tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Five children opened the session with ``powerful stories of
their own experiences,'' said Bruce Reed, the White House domestic
policy adviser. Gore called it a wide-ranging discussion, as
panelists noted how everything from domestic violence to the
quality of after-school care, from the Internet to the availability
of guns impacts the behavior of young people.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the meeting some had expected to be an opportunity to
bash the gun lobby turned into one of considerable presidential
praise for two gun-trade groups _ the American Shooting Sports
Council and the National Shooting Sports Foundation Inc. _ that in
recent days tentatively endorsed what Clinton called ``common sense
measures'' to strengthen federal gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are proposals to raise the age to 21 from 18 for
legally possessing a handgun; require background checks for buyers
at gun shows; ban violent juveniles from ever buying a gun; expand
gun tracing nationally; and make parents legally liable for
allowing youngsters access to guns later used in crime.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association, the largest lobby of gun owners,
was not invited to send its president, actor Charlton Heston, to
Monday's White House meeting. Wayne LaPierre, the NRA's executive
director, said Clinton was afraid Heston would expose the
``complete collapse'' of the Justice Department's enforcement of
federal firearms laws during the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of dealing with (prosecutions), what we see is the
president now dusting off every tired old gun-control bill that's
been around his administration for the last six years ... tired old
schemes that have no real impact on this criminal culture of
violence in this country,'' LaPierre said. Monday the NRA began a
national advertising campaign aimed at affirming its support for
unfettered gun ownership for law-abiding Americans.
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre was joined at a news conference by Robert Delfay,
executive director of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, who
turned down an invitation to the strategy session because the White
House was ``trying to drive a wedge between the industry and the
National Rifle Association.'' Such a wedge, he said, ``does not
exist.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to begin debate Tuesday on a juvenile
crime bill that once was aimed at making violent juveniles stand
trial as adults but now is expected to become a vehicle for a
number of gun-control amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Monday Clinton said he has instructed Dr. David Satcher, the US
surgeon general, to prepare a report on youth violence that would
review existing research and particularly assess the impact of the
Internet and video games on youth behavior. The idea came from,
among others, Democratic Representative Edward J. Markey of
Massachuetts, who was also instrumental in legislation that makes
the V-Chip _ a device for allowing adults to block objectionable
programming _ mandatory in new television sets next year.
</P>
<P>
   A survey released Monday by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a
California-based research group, showed 80 percent of parents said
they had heard of the TV ratings now in use, but only 39 percent of
them said they had seen an explanation of them. Seventy-seven
percent said they would block shows they don't want their children
to watch if their television sets were equipped with such
technology, while 20 percent said they would not.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said that during the meeting, Gore praised ABC, CBS, and
most cable networks for rating children's programs and ``chided''
NBC for not taking part in the effort. Reed also said there were
``encouraging signs'' from the entertainment industry that it was
trying to ``galvanize efforts'' on the violence issue.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti, the film industry's longtime Washington lobbyist,
said, ``An increasing number of creative people in Hollywood are
willing to examine the issue of gratuitous'' violence. But, he
added, ``I do not know of a single piece of research that shows
somebody looked at Quake or Doom or looked at a movie and then
grabbed a Tec-DC9 and then went out and blew somebody's head off.''

FDA CHIEF DEFENDS FAST-TRACK SYSTEM FOR DRUG APPROVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKVILLE, Md. _ When the Food and Drug Administration was
forced to ban five prescription drugs in a recent one-year period,
critics said the agency had compromised patient safety as it
hurried new medicines to market. Monday, the agency's new
commissioner responded, making public an internal review that found
the agency's emphasis on speedy drug approvals was not to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has the standard been maintained at a high level?'' Dr. Jane
Henney, FDA commissioner, asked during a briefing with reporters at
the agency's headquarters. ``The answer to that is yes. Adverse
events are no greater now than when the system was slow.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, commissioned by Ms. Henney when she assumed control
over the agency six months ago, took a wide-ranging look at the
risks posed by products the FDA approves, and how the health care
system copes with those risks. With many new drugs and medical
devices coming into the market, the report concluded, government
and private industry must work together to develop a ``new
framework'' for reducing risk that will draw doctors, hospitals,
pharmacists and patients into a dialogue about drug safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``In calling for a broader drug safety debate, this is a step
forward,'' said Thomas Moore, a health policy fellow at George
Washington University Medical Center and a frequent critic of the
FDA. ``Saving lives and preventing injuries is going to have to
involve doctors and patients and medical groups. It isn't just a
simple matter of blaming the FDA.''
</P>
<P>
   But agency officials are sensitive to being blamed, particularly
in light of the ban on the five prescription drugs, including the
painkiller Duract, the hypertension drug Posicor and the
antihistamine Seldane, during the 12-month period that began in
September 1997. Critics, including Moore, have said those drugs
should never have been approved.
</P>
<P>
   The report issued Monday is one of two new studies, both
conducted by current and former FDA managers, to examine whether
the withdrawal of those drugs was the direct result of the
Prescription Drug User Fee Act, a 1992 law that enabled the agency
to speed drug reviews by hiring additional reviewers with fees from
the pharmaceutical industry.
</P>
<P>
   The other, led by Dr. Michael Friedman, acting FDA commissioner
until Ms. Henney took over, will be made public Tuesday and
published in this week's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, the average time for approval of a new drug
has dropped to 12 months from about 30 months. In addition, the FDA
report said, the agency has sharply increased the number of new
medicines it approves each year to an average of 97 from an average
of 70. Although the arm of the agency that approves medical devices
does not receive money through the user fee act, it too has dropped
its review time, to 12 months in 1998 from 27 months in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   With respect to drugs, the study commissioned by Ms. Henney
found that over the past 20 years, the FDA had consistently
withdrawn 1 percent to 3.5 percent of all the new compounds it
approved.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the five drugs that were pulled from pharmacy shelves
from September 1997 to September 1998 were reviewed prior to
adoption of the 1992 law, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   And, the authors found, unexpected serious reactions to new
drugs are occurring less frequently today than in the past.
Nonetheless, the report recommended that the agency develop units
to track problems with drugs after approval.
</P>
<P>
   Those findings did not quiet the agency's critics, among them
Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's Health Research
Group, an advocacy organization in Washington, who questioned
whether the agency was ``disregarding the views of its own
physicians'' who objected to the marketing of certain drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe said he conducted a recent survey of the agency's 172
medical officers; 53 responded, he said, and of those, 19
identified a total of 27 drugs that were approved over their
objections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly applaud the idea that more attention has to be
paid once a drug gets on the market,'' he said. ``But to say, as
FDA does, that you can assume that all those drugs that are on the
market should be there, is just a reckless statement.''

CLINTON CALLS FOR NATIONAL CAMPAIGN AGAINST YOUTH VIOLENCE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hoping to halt the spasm of school shootings,
President Clinton opened a national campaign against youth violence
Monday by challenging all Americans to do more to purge gory images
and easy access to weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The White House hosted a three-hour East Room strategy session
that brought 60 artists, parents, students, religious leaders,
police officers, gun manufacturers and gun control advocates
together for the first time to discuss ways to curtail violence by
youths.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton convened the conference after the April 20 Columbine
High School massacre in Littleton, Colo., in which two teen-agers
killed 13 people and themselves. It was the latest in a series of
school shootings that experts blame on a variety of ills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that there is more for us to do at home and at school,
in Hollywood and the heartland and here in Washington. Every
parent, every teacher, every leader has something more to do,''
Clinton said as Hillary Rodham Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and
Tipper Gore joined him in the Rose Garden after the session.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady announced the formation of a nonprofit
organization that would continue the national campaign, using as a
model the administration's efforts to combat teen-age pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will come forward, we hope, with very specific suggestions
about what parents can do, what schools can do, what community
groups can do, what the media can do, what gun manufacturers can
do, what all of us can do,'' Hillary Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president urged parents to turn off the television when they
see programming they don't like and to keep an eye on computer use
and to refuse to buy products that glorify violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If no one consumes these products, people will stop producing
them. They will not build it if you don't come,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He also encouraged the entertainment industry to join the cause,
saying its ``wholehearted participation'' was needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot pretend that there is no impact on our culture and
our children that is adverse if there is too much violence coming
out of what they see and experience,'' Clinton said. ``We have to
ask people who produce things to consider the consequences of them
_ whether it's a violent movie, a CD, a video game. If they are
made, they at least should not be marketed to children.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Clinton again called on Congress to pass legislation
raising the legal age to purchase weapons from 18 to 21. He also
has called on manufacturers to install child-proof locks on weapons
and wants to extend the instant background-check system to weapons
sold at gun shows. Earlier, a group of gun manufacturers and
pro-gun groups endorsed portions of Clinton's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Initial worries by entertainment and gun advocates that the
meeting would turn into a finger-pointing session proved unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very, very productive meeting. There was absolutely
no finger pointing, no bashing that went on,'' said Bob Ricker,
executive director of the American Schooling Council, an
association of gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   But the National Rifle Association, which was not invited to the
White House, held a competing new conference to accuse Clinton of
failing to enforce gun laws. ``We have the tools to get at this
culture of violence and don't do it,'' said Wayne LaPierre, NRA
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition also criticized the session, renewing
its call for a school prayer amendment and tax cuts that it says
would allow parents to spend more time at home. It ran
advertisements on its ideas in Iowa and New Hampshire, two key
presidential election states, to coincide with the White House
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the session drew a cross section of the nation's opinion
leaders, ranging from poet Maya Angelou to Steve Case, the
president of America On-line. The heads of ABC, which is a part of
Disney, and CBS also were on hand as were four religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here as a parent. I got invited because, I guess, of my
career, but I am here as a concerned parent. Everyone is concerned.
Everyone is shocked. I think we all want to be a part of the
solution,'' said singer Gloria Estefan. ``I think it would be
horrible if our children saw all these things being discussed and
nothing really came of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Estefan said she also opposed censorship. ``To me music has
always been a mirror image of what youth is feeling and I think it
would be ludicrous to try to censor that because this is a good way
for us to look at how these kids are feeling. This is a tool for
parents to sit down and have a conversation about what's going
on,'' she said.

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Rescuing boys from `gender straitjacket'
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Young boys would prefer to express their emotions
with tears and hugs, if only we'd let them without calling them
sissies or mama's boys. They tell psychologist William Pollack they
wish they could talk about deep or difficult feelings without being
ridiculed, the way girls can.
</P>
<P>
   `` 'I guess guys can't do those things that normal people do,'''
Pollack recalls one teen-age boy's telling him. As long as we
embarrass boys out of showing such feelings as pain, fear,
dependence or sadness, he says we can expect some of them to emote
through guns and pipe bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Pollack's paperback book describes the consequences of teaching
boys at a young age that the world is not a safe place for males
with vulnerable feelings and offers some ways to make it safer, one
boy at a time. The Harvard Medical School researcher's book is Real
Boys: Rescuing Our Sons from the Myths of Boyhood ($13.95, Henry
Holt).
</P>
<P>
   The ``Boy Code,'' as Pollack calls it, requires real boys and
real men ``to be competitive, be a big wheel, be a sturdy oak. They
should take everything with a stiff upper lip, and the worst
possible thing would be for them to ask for help or admit they
can't achieve all this on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder they never ask for directions when they grow up and
drive cars, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Placed in society's ``gender straitjacket,'' Pollack says boys
are compelled to look tough even as they feel afraid and alone.
They notice the contradiction, of course, but they're ashamed of
that vulnerability. Real boys don't feel that way, they've learned,
so something must be wrong with them.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the only alternatives seem to be either repressing all
emotions or expressing them violently, the way a ``real man''
would.
</P>
<P>
   ``Littleton is the tip of an iceberg, and the iceberg is boys,''
Pollack says of the Colorado school massacre last month. His
opinions were in sudden demand after that, with television
appearances on Oprah the next day and at a town meeting in
Littleton the next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are the warning signs?'' people asked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What signs do you mean?'' he asked them back. ``The signs that
someone is likely to kill somebody or the signs of boys who are
developing along the lines of becoming depressed and hurt, some of
whom will go to that point?''
</P>
<P>
   Boys are at least four times more likely than girls to commit
suicide, Pollack writes, and nearly 10 times as likely to be
diagnosed with a serious emotional disorder, usually attention
deficit disorder. From ages 8 through 12, they have more and deeper
cases of clinical depression. But girls' depression is easier to
diagnose, with more classic symptoms of sadness, while boys'
depression often surfaces as patterns of anger, misbehavior or
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does a boy have to grow up feeling ashamed of who he is
and confused about what it means to be a real boy or a real man?''
Pollack says. ``Why does he have to marry and not be able to talk
to his wife about his feelings? Why, after that first argument with
his wife, does he have to get drunk? And after the fifth, have an
affair? And after 15 years of marriage, have a divorce? And after
the second divorce, why does he have to have a midlife crisis,
which is really a depression?''
</P>
<P>
   Pollack answers his questions with the word ``shame,'' a term
psychologists use because ``dissed'' doesn't look good in
professional journals. They don't mean the remorse people feel
because of something they did, but the shame they feel because of
how others acted toward them.
</P>
<P>
   If you're snubbed by an old friend who didn't recognize you, you
might feel shame. If the old friend was only pretending not to
recognize you, he might feel remorse. He might act differently the
next time he sees an old friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``But shame doesn't lead to correcting behavior,'' Pollack says.
``Shame leads to enactment or withdrawal. Some boys will go as far
as hurting or killing somebody else not to be shamed.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not suggesting that parents encourage their boys to break
out of this gender straitjacket by sobbing on the basketball court
or hugging the best friend who helped them do homework. He'd like
to see society change to accept vulnerable emotions from males, but
he knows it won't happen tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Pollack says parents, teachers and coaches can
take steps to help.
</P>
<P>
   The most important thing is creating what he calls ``shame-free
zones,'' where boys can express their natural emotions. Parents do
that by making boys comfortable talking about their anger or
sadness in the basketball game or their warm gratitude for the
schoolwork help.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers should be made to feel comfortable hugging and cuddling
their sons without the fear of turning them into wimps, Pollack
says. And fathers should be comfortable that roughhousing with
their sons won't turn them into violent outlaws and hugging them
afterward won't make them soft. ``It turns out, the research shows
boys who do that have fewer temper tantrums.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools must recognize that young boys who don't like sitting
still for long stretches ``are not being bad, or poor students,''
he says. ``They're being normal boys, and we should not shame them,
punish them or medicate them out of who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaches need to give boys the constructive outlet of competitive
play, he says, and not the middle-aged memories of being told they
played like girls. The most important thing they can teach is how
to lose without the world falling apart. ``Men don't learn that,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   So grown-up boys don't know how to cope with life's losses, and
they feel like talking about their disappointment or frustration
will only make them losers again. ``And we're just accepting
that,'' Pollack says, ``because we assume that's the way boys
should be.''

CLINTON OPENS DIALOGUE OVER YOUTH VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w, e and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Careful not to blame youth violence on any one
cause, President Clinton opened a national conversation with an
eclectic group of leaders Monday on how to prevent another tragedy
like last month's student massacre in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The most substantive result of the three-hour White House
session was the launch of a national campaign and nonprofit
foundation aimed at curbing youth violence. But just as important,
the president said, was the sense from the meeting that gunmakers,
the media, and community political and religious leaders came
together committed to help parents raise healthier children.
</P>
<P>
   The president also challenged the entertainment industry to be
sensitive to and take responsibility for what he said was a
``coarsening of the culture'' and a movement away from creating a
positive image of American life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot pretend that there is no impact on our culture and
our children that is adverse if there is too much violence coming
out of what they see and experience,'' Clinton said in the Rose
Garden after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so we have to ask people who produce things to consider
the consequences of them, whether it's a violent movie, a CD, a
video game. If they are made, they at least should not be marketed
to children,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The presidents of CBS Television and ABC/Disney attended the
meeting, which was closed to the news media, as did the head of
America On-Line and the Recording Industry Association of America.
In all, 60 people strategized around a large, rectangular table in
the White House East Room, including singer Gloria Estefan, poet
Maya Angelou, and the Rev. Eugene Rivers of Boston. First Lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton and Vice President Al Gore and his wife,
Tipper, participated, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president attempted today to get out front on an issue
that needed some kind of presidential response in the aftermath of
the Littleton affair,'' Rivers said after the meeting. ``But
ultimately the initiative will be led by grass-roots activists who
don't confuse White House sessions with building a real-world
antiviolence movement that focuses on prevention, intervention, and
zero tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Five children opened the session with ``powerful stories of
their own experiences,'' said Bruce Reed, the White House domestic
policy adviser. Gore called it a wide-ranging discussion, as
panelists noted how everything from domestic violence to the
quality of after-school care, from the Internet to the availability
of guns impacts the behavior of young people.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the meeting some had expected to be an opportunity to
bash the gun lobby turned into one of considerable presidential
praise for two gun-trade groups _ the American Shooting Sports
Council and the National Shooting Sports Foundation Inc. _ that in
recent days tentatively endorsed what Clinton called ``common sense
measures'' to strengthen federal gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are proposals to raise the age to 21 from 18 for
legally possessing a handgun; require background checks for buyers
at gun shows; ban violent juveniles from ever buying a gun; expand
gun tracing nationally; and make parents legally liable for
allowing youngsters access to guns later used in crime.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association, the largest lobby of gun owners,
was not invited to send its president, actor Charlton Heston, to
Monday's White House meeting. Wayne LaPierre, the NRA's executive
director, said Clinton was afraid Heston would expose the
``complete collapse'' of the Justice Department's enforcement of
federal firearms laws during the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of dealing with (prosecutions), what we see is the
president now dusting off every tired old gun-control bill that's
been around his administration for the last six years ... tired old
schemes that have no real impact on this criminal culture of
violence in this country,'' LaPierre said. Monday the NRA began a
national advertising campaign aimed at affirming its support for
unfettered gun ownership for law-abiding Americans.
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre was joined at a news conference by Robert Delfay,
executive director of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, who
turned down an invitation to the strategy session because the White
House was ``trying to drive a wedge between the industry and the
National Rifle Association.'' Such a wedge, he said, ``does not
exist.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to begin debate Tuesday on a juvenile
crime bill that once was aimed at making violent juveniles stand
trial as adults but now is expected to become a vehicle for a
number of gun-control amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Monday Clinton said he has instructed Dr. David Satcher, the US
surgeon general, to prepare a report on youth violence that would
review existing research and particularly assess the impact of the
Internet and video games on youth behavior. The idea came from,
among others, Democratic Representative Edward J. Markey of
Massachuetts, who was also instrumental in legislation that makes
the V-Chip _ a device for allowing adults to block objectionable
programming _ mandatory in new television sets next year.
</P>
<P>
   A survey released Monday by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a
California-based research group, showed 80 percent of parents said
they had heard of the TV ratings now in use, but only 39 percent of
them said they had seen an explanation of them. Seventy-seven
percent said they would block shows they don't want their children
to watch if their television sets were equipped with such
technology, while 20 percent said they would not.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said that during the meeting, Gore praised ABC, CBS, and
most cable networks for rating children's programs and ``chided''
NBC for not taking part in the effort. Reed also said there were
``encouraging signs'' from the entertainment industry that it was
trying to ``galvanize efforts'' on the violence issue.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti, the film industry's longtime Washington lobbyist,
said, ``An increasing number of creative people in Hollywood are
willing to examine the issue of gratuitous'' violence. But, he
added, ``I do not know of a single piece of research that shows
somebody looked at Quake or Doom or looked at a movie and then
grabbed a Tec-DC9 and then went out and blew somebody's head off.''

`MARY CASSATT': A DELIGHTFUL FAMILY DRAMA
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Broadcast notes are at the end of the review. Time, channel
are for New York area. Check local listings.) 
(ms) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mary Cassatt did not really stand in her Paris studio in 1878,
pause in her work on a painting she planned to show at the Salon
and tell her teen-age niece, ``There's more to life than marriage,
my girl.'' But it would have been nice if she had. That indulgent
fantasy is at the heart of ``Mary Cassatt: American
Impressionist,'' a thoroughly charming episode in the occasional
series of HBO family dramas called ``The Artists' Specials.''
</P>
<P>
   As in the Composers' Specials and the Inventors' Specials in
previous seasons, here children help great creators arrive at their
best work. Apparently Leonardo da Vinci and Albert Einstein would
have been nowhere without the young friends who quizzed and
inspired them. The idea is handled with such glee and fidelity to
the creators' work (if not to history) that the specials are bound
to please both children and adults.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Brenneman (better known from ``NYPD Blue'' and a current
guest stint on ``Frasier'') is appealingly down to earth as
Cassatt. The paintings she works on are exact copies of the
artist's; the beautifully designed production is so full of
references to her work that it resembles a Cassatt come to life. So
what if the story takes liberties with the chronology of her career
and makes itself accessible through modern attitudes and language?
It is an engaging, lively tale that turns out to be a subtle lesson
in art, independence and creativity.
</P>
<P>
   The child-heroine is Cassatt's 14-year-old niece, Katherine, who
begins the drama with the timeless line, ``I will never, ever
forgive my parents.'' The last thing she wants is to be away from
her friends in Philadelphia on a vacation with her parents and
younger brother and sister to visit the aunt she calls an ``old
maid.'' And at first Aunt Mary is not happy to have three children
and a puppy scampering around her studio. But in the course of this
hourlong story, the children provide her with all sorts of
practical help.
</P>
<P>
   One day the youngest child, Elsie, is watching her aunt work.
``Why are you using all dark colors?'' Elsie asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because that's the traditional style &UR; , &LR;  and the Salon is very
traditional,'' Cassatt sighs. (She is working on ``The Musical
Party,'' one of her more conventional paintings.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I like bright colors,'' says Elsie, who happens to be sitting
in a bright blue chair, dressed exactly like the child in Cassatt's
vivid ``Little Girl in a Blue Armchair.'' ``So do I,'' the aunt
says, setting aside her old canvas and starting on what we soon see
as that completed, recognizable painting.
</P>
<P>
   If Cassatt learns fast, Katherine does not. Standing outside a
gallery window, looking at a canvas of a Degas ballet dancer, she
complains, ``You can't make out the faces, they're all blurry.''
Aunt Mary rolls her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes it so remarkable!'' she says, and explains a
little about Impressionism.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine does have a flair for romance, though. She has a
flirtation with Gilbert, the son of Cassatt's maid. And all three
children play matchmaker, arranging for Aunt Mary to meet her idol,
Degas. Fantasies go only so far, even in this fiction; Degas does
not become Uncle Edgar. He does become Cassatt's friend and
artistic colleague.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Cassatt's brother and his family did pay a crucial
visit to her in Paris, but that happened in 1880, after she had
already met Degas and exhibited with the Impressionists.
</P>
<P>
   And Cassatt's parents were living with her at the time. She may
have had a rebellious streak, but she remained a respectable lady
from Philadelphia, properly chaperoned.
</P>
<P>
   None of that would have made as good a story. Only the most
churlish historical stickler would be able to resist this tale's
inspired bits of creative license. One day Louisa May Alcott comes
to tea and asks Katherine, ``What do you want to do with your
life?'' (In fact, Louisa's sister May, the inspiration for Amy in
``Little Women,'' was a friend of Cassatt's when both lived in
Paris, so it's not that much of a stretch.)
</P>
<P>
   The Artists' Specials are not to be confused with HBO's
heavy-handed ``Dear America'' series, which focuses on girls in
historical settings and proves that playing games with history is
not enough to make a lively series. ``Mary Cassatt'' is a delight
because it is first of all an endearing story about how Katherine
and her independent-minded aunt come to understand and love each
other.

SPORTS COLUMN: KNICKS FIND ELBOW ROOM WITH DUDLEY
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ How many Knicks fans thought they'd ever look for Chris
Dudley to come to the rescue?
</P>
<P>
   But with the Knicks facing a succession of Armageddon-type games
against a suddenly desperate Miami, including Monday night's Game 2
of this opening-round playoff series here, Dudley's sharp elbows
and knees have assumed a prominent role. Depending on how you look
at his salary _ $7.5 million this season, then $7.1 million, $6.2
million and $6.2 million _ Dudley is either the rich man's Charles
Oakley or simply a rich man.
</P>
<P>
   As the Knicks have gone from a team relying solely on strong-arm
tactics to a more transition-ready team, the 6-foot-11-inch,
260-pound Dudley is the last vestige of the team's black-and-blue
era. He stands as a reminder to the Heat _ and anyone else _ that
for all the talk about ``new Knicks,'' there is bruising muscle at
the end of the fast break.
</P>
<P>
   With Oakley gone, Dudley has becomes more than a rebounder, but
someone counted on to shake things up, create some chaos and, in
this Miami series, try to push Miami's Alonzo Mourning beyond his
breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to say protect, but I definitely expect to be inside
and a physical force on the boards, defending the post,'' Dudley
said. ``These games with Miami _ you know how physical they can
get. They can be wars. I enjoy that. I expect to be in there mixing
it up.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of Dudley's tenure with the Knicks, his problem has
been fitting in, or at least finding a role. Last month, as the
Knicks began to jell, Dudley found his niche. He started in place
of Patrick Ewing in a crucial game against Charlotte, and bumped
and banged Hornets center Elden Campbell into 3-of-14 shooting.
Dudley scored 7 points and 12 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our second unit is a high energy group,'' Dudley said. ``With
Marcus, Latrell, Chris and myself, we try to keep the intensity
level up. Especially coming off the bench, I don't have to worry
about the fouls. I can really make things happen, especially if the
tempo is a little slow. I just try to mix it up get the intensity
going. Pick up the energy.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of his 12-season career in the National Basketball
Association, the Knicks' 34-year-old backup center has been
perceived as precisely that, an overpaid backup, even when he was
starting with the Nets and Portland. When he signed a huge contract
with the Nets, fans scratched their heads; when he got a larger
contract with Phoenix, they scratched their heads again. When the
Knicks picked him up in a trade with Portland, the common wisdom
was that Dudley was one more big body in a big-body offense. Then
last season, Ewing shattered his wrist, Dudley started 22 games in
his place, and it seemed the acquisition had paid off.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 4 of last season's Knicks-Heat playoff series, Dudley
was so physically tough in defending against Mourning, he proved
instrumental in lifting the Knicks to the victory. When Dudley
fouled out late in the fourth quarter, the Garden crowd gave him an
ovation.
</P>
<P>
   This season has been more uneven for Dudley, who has alternated
between not playing to starting to playing a minimum number of
minutes as the Knicks struggled to find a groove.
</P>
<P>
   In March, during a game against the Lakers, Dudley provoked
Shaquille O'Neal into a push that that cost him a $3,500 fine.
Dudley was fined $2,500 for throwing the ball at O'Neal in
retaliation. On April 25, in a game in Miami that the Knicks
desperately needed, Dudley was torched for 27 points by Mourning.
But at the moment of truth, Van Gundy put Dudley on Mourning for
Miami's final possession. He bodied Mourning, pushed him just out
of his range and forced him to put up an awkward shot as the Knicks
by 2 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally its been a little up and down but it ended on a
real good note,'' he said. ``At the end of the year I was playing a
lot. And the stretch when we were 21-21 and we had to win six out
of the last eight or five out of the last eight, that probably is
when I felt I played some of my best games. I started a lot of
those games and really think I helped us to get over that hump.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Knicks, Monday night's game notwithstanding, have become
a team within a team _ more agile and athletic on the surface, but
still full of elbows and knees.
</P>
<P>
   In this bizarre season, Dudley is beginning to feel appreciated
for his ``skills.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have felt that,'' he said. ``It's fun to contribute, for
people to expect me to get things going, keep things going. It is
reward to be part of that, I felt that in Portland and New Jersey.
It feels good to feel that here.'' &QL;

HUNDREDS OF UNPOPULAR TEXAS BILLS ARE DEAD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When it comes to moving unpopular bills through
the legislative process, ``never say die'' is an unwritten law
among House members.
</P>
<P>
   But with the arrival of Monday's deadline for House bills to
pass House committees, one could almost hear the faint, final gasps
of hundreds of unsuccessful measures _ some old, some new _ echoing
through the Capitol halls.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these faltering bills could be revived as amendments to
viable legislation before the session ends May 31. Other concepts
may survive through similar Senate versions that are still
breathing. However, most of the bills left pending in House
committees are simply dead.  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Among the dead and dying ideas are a lower sales tax rate,
approval for state-run casinos, a ban of hog-dogging and the option
for juries to sentence a murderer to life without parole. Also
languishing in House committees were proposals to repeal the
anti-sodomy law, ban same-sex marriages and gay adoptions, mandate
parental consent for a minor's abortion and require premarital AIDS
testing.
</P>
<P>
   A measure making it possible to execute 16-year-old murderers
(the minimum age now is 17) appears dead as well, as does a bill to
end executions of the mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   Other early victims of the clock were bills to wrest control of
the Alamo from the Daughters of the Texas Revolution; to declare
Austin as a capital district subject to direct legislative control;
and to require turkey hunters to use shotguns (rifles are allowed
in most parts of the state).
</P>
<P>
   Also dead were bills to ban use of cellular phones while driving
and to totally rewrite the Texas Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process is designed to kill bills, not pass bills, which
is probably pretty good,'' said Rep. Rob Junell, D-San Angelo. The
influential chairman of the House Appropriations Committee is among
members with many dead bills on file.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bills that really should pass really do. Those that should
die, die. And there's some kind of never-never land in between
there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After all, about 4,000 bills were filed in the House this
session and 1,800 in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, here is a rundown of some of the House bills that
likely won't make it into law:
</P>
<P>
   _ House Bill 343, by Rep. Arlene Wohlgemuth, R-Burleson, to
require parental ``consent'' for a minor's abortion. (A bill
requiring parental ``notification'' is still alive.)
</P>
<P>
   _ House Bill 383, by Rep. Warren Chisum, R-Pampa, preventing the
state from recognizing same-sex marriages performed in other
states.
</P>
<P>
   _ House Bill 475, by Rep. Glen Maxey, D-Austin, prohibiting
employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   _ House Bill 3069, by Rep. Juan Hinojosa, D-McAllen, barring
execution of the mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   _ House Bill 1389, by Rep. Ron Wilson, D-Houston, making it
illegal to conduct a fight between a dog and a hog, a popular East
Texas sport.
</P>
<P>
   _ House Bill 337, by Rep. Debra Danburg, D-Houston, repealing
the Texas Penal Code provision that makes sodomy a crime.
</P>
<P>
   _ House Bill 11, by Rep. Tony Goolsby, R-Dallas, would require
turkey hunters to use only shotguns, not other firearms.
</P>
<P>
   _ House Bill 607, by Rep. Talmadge Heflin, R-Houston, would
lower the state sales tax from the current 6.25 percent to 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ House Bill 1525, by Wilson, would place the Alamo in San
Antonio under Texas Parks and Wildlife Department jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   _ House Bill 3077, accompanied by a proposed constitutional
amendment, both by Wilson, would declare Austin to be a ``capital
district,'' subject to hands-on legislative managing.
</P>
<P>
   _ House Bill 350, by Wohlgemuth, would create ``covenant
marriages,'' requiring couples to sign a prenuptial agreements that
would demand extra efforts before divorcing.
</P>
<P>
   _ House Bill 717, by Chisum, would mandate premarital testing
for HIV.
</P>
<P>
   _ House Bill 41, by Rep. Jim Pitts, R-Waxahachie, would change
the penal code to say that no person younger than 16 could be
executed. The code currently sets the lowest age for execution at
17.
</P>
<P>
   _ House Bill 77 by Rep. Pete Gallego, D-Alpine, would eliminate
the possibility of parole for those sentenced to life in prison.
Inmates serving life currently are eligible for parole after
serving 40 calendar years.
</P>
<P>
   _ House Joint Resolution 86, a proposed constitutional amendment
by Wilson, would authorize state-operated casinos.

HSBC TO PURCHASE REPUBLIC NEW YORK FOR $10.3 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>

 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ HSBC Holdings PLC announced Monday that it would
purchase the parent company of Republic National Bank of New York
for $10.3 billion cash, the biggest foreign takeover deal for an
American banking company.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of Republic New York Corp. and an affiliate by HSBC
_ an international banking group based in London with antecedents
in Hong Kong and Shanghai, China _ would double the size of HSBC's
private-banking business. It would also give HSBC the third-biggest
retail branch network in the New York City region, serving lower-
and middle-income customers with low-cost checking and free
automated teller machine services.
</P>
<P>
   Banking industry analysts said the deal largely reflected HSBC's
efforts to expand its highly profitable private-banking operations,
which serve very wealthy clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strategically it fits,'' said James Johnson, an analyst with
Credit Lyonnais Securities. ``It complements them in an area they
have been pushing _ wealth management.''
</P>
<P>
   But the deal would likely result in layoffs at Republic's New
York operations, to eliminate duplication with HSBC Bank USA, the
network of American branches formerly known as Marine Midland.
Analysts also said that the potential effects of the deal on
Republic's less affluent customers remained unclear, though they
could include new services and higher fees.
</P>
<P>
   Republic's sale would mark the end of independence for a banking
business founded more than three decades ago by Edmond Safra, a
Lebanese-born Jewish businessman who is regarded as an enduring
figure in the banking world.
</P>
<P>
   Safra, now 66, suffers these days from Parkinson's disease, a
neurological disorder, and there had been growing speculation in
recent days that he might sell. Republic's stock rose 14 percent on
Friday, and HSBC's purchase plan was reported on Sunday evening by
Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   Under the $72-a-share agreement, HSBC is buying Republic New
York Corp. and an affiliated company, Safra Republic Holdings SA,
the parent of banks that serve clients in havens like Switzerland,
Luxembourg and Monaco.
</P>
<P>
   HSBC has grown aggressively out of its roots in the colonial
Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. It is now a major competitor in the
business of managing money for the wealthy, a profitable business
that helps offset the risks in such other operations as loans to
emerging-market countries in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would surpass the previous record for a foreign
takeover of an American bank, the $10.1 billion purchase of Bankers
Trust by Deutsche Bank announced late last year. It also would be
HSBC's biggest purchase since it acquired Marine Midland Bank of
Britain for $6.1 billion in 1992, which led to the relocation of
its headquarters from Hong Kong to London.
</P>
<P>
   The combined operations of HSBC and Republic would have assets
of $554.4 billion and employ, as of the moment, 136,700 people.
HSBC said it would finance the purchase partly through borrowings
and a $3 billion stock sale.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Russell, HSBC's spokesman, said the move would maintain
the bank's avowed intention to balance its holdings in the
developed world with investment in emerging markets. And, he said,
``it gives us an extra million customers in the world's biggest
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal requires regulatory approval in Britain, the United
States, Hong Kong and elsewhere, but Russell said HSBC hoped to
complete it by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   HSBC had previously announced that it would list its shares for
trading in the United States, and there has since been speculation
that it planned a big American acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   After rising Friday on takeover speculation, Republic shares
fell $1.9375 to $68.0625 in New York on Monday. Safra Republic
shares, traded in Luxembourg, rose $17.50 to $66. HSBC shares fell
3.2 percent in London to 21.20 pounds, or $34.60.
</P>
<P>
   By purchasing Safra Republic Holdings, HSBC will acquire 30,000
international clients in high-margin private banking that generally
caters to people with more than $1 million in liquid investment
funds. The affiliate has 44 offices holding client funds that total
$56.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they want to capture is an ever growing number of
millionaires in Asia and, to some extent, in Latin America,'' said
Simon Samuels, a banking analyst at Salomon Smith Barney here.
Wealth management, he said, was also seen as ``the flavor of the
next century'' because of projections that, with the ever shrinking
ability of governments to provide pensions, there would be a
corresponding boom in private savings investment by individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The acquisitions we have announced today will bring together
two complementary private banking franchises,'' said HSBC's
chairman, John Bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the stroke of a pen it doubles the size of our consumer
banking operations in the United States and it doubles the size of
our private banking business around the world.''

MARKET PLACE: SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISM, FRANKLIN MUTUAL-STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (mk) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The spirit of Michael Price has risen, and it is hovering over
Thermo Electron Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Barely six months after Price retired from active oversight of
the Franklin Mutual Series funds, a group of six mutual funds with
more than $21 billion in assets, his successors are showing that
they intend to continue his practice of aggressively focusing on
companies with underperforming stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Applying a brand of shareholder activism rare among fund
managers, Price made his reputation and fortune by taking big
stakes in companies, then advocating change at them _ perhaps most
famously with Chase Manhattan Corp., which ultimately merged with
Chemical Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Now in his successors' sights: Thermo Electron, a sprawling
group of medical equipment and industrial machinery companies based
in Waltham, Mass., whose stock price has fallen by more than 50
percent in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Franklin funds fired off a pointed letter to
George Hatsopoulos, Thermo's chairman and chief executive,
requesting more independent directors on the company's board, an
aggressive share-repurchase program and a restructuring of the
corporation and its 23 publicly traded subsidiaries. Franklin
Mutual said it owns 3.4 million Thermo Electron shares, or about 2
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   The letter sets the stage for a dramatic confrontation at the
company's May 27 annual meeting in Waltham.
</P>
<P>
   That meeting could also be a tense debut for Richard Syron, who
on June 1 will move from chairman of the American Stock Exchange to
chief executive of Thermo Electron.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1956 by Hatsopoulos, a Greek immigrant and mechanical
engineer who is now 72 years old, Thermo Electron develops new
technologies and then builds separate companies around them. Their
wide-ranging operations, from biomedical instruments to
paper-making and recycling equipment, fall into four business
segments: measurement and detection; biomedical technologies;
energy and the environment, and recycling and resource recovery.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of its unusual strategy, Thermo Electron has
achieved a fairly high profile. Its revenue of $3.87 billion ranks
No. 394 in the Fortune 500 list of the largest companies, and as a
component of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, its shares are
broadly owned by mutual funds, pension funds and other
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   But shareholders have often complained that the spinoff strategy
has fragmented corporate resources, splintered management's
attention and weakened the parent.
</P>
<P>
   After profits fell last year and the stock plummeted, Thermo
Electron laid out a plan to reduce its publicly traded subsidiaries
to 16 from 23. The company recently announced plans to repurchase
$100 million in stock, in addition to $102 million bought back this
year and $28 million already slated for repurchase.
</P>
<P>
   The management, though, is apparently moving too slowly for the
Franklin fund managers. Another disgruntled contingent are
investors who paid $40.625 for Thermo Electron shares in an April
1998 stock offering. The stock gained 87.5 cents Monday on the New
York Stock Exchange, to close at $18.3125.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company's stock performance over the past year _ down 60
percent, versus an increase of 18 percent for its peer group _
reflects a failure to take full advantage of the rich hidden assets
within an overly complicated corporate structure,'' wrote David
Marcus, a Franklin senior vice president, and Robert Friedman,
chief investment officer for the Mutual Series funds, in a letter
last week to Hatsopoulos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this performance is unsatisfactory and should not
be allowed to continue given Thermo's rich management talent,
market position and financial flexibility,'' read the letter, a
copy of which was provided to The New York Times by a person
sympathetic to the fund company's plans.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday, Friedman said that the fund company had
been in touch with Thermo Electron's management and that he
expected discussions to continue. Thermo Electron executives did
not return phone calls seeking comment. A company spokesman, who
confirmed receipt of the letter, said, ``Our responsibility is to
take into account all suggestions from shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Syron, whose rich compensation package at Thermo includes three
years of guaranteed bonuses and has sparked dissension on Internet
message boards, was traveling Monday and unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Under Price's guidance, the Mutual Series of funds, which
includes Mutual Shares, Mutual Qualified and Mutual Beacon, over
the years bought large stakes and then pressured a company's
management for change. Price, who sold the fund company to Franklin
Resources in 1996, remains chairman of the Mutual Series funds but
does not participate in investment decisions.
</P>
<P>
   His efforts often resulted in big profits for the Mutual Series
funds, as well as other shareholders. Winning investments included
Storage Technology and Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. Sometimes the campaign
culminated in the sale of a company, as with Price's 1995 pursuit
of Chase Manhattan, which a year later merged with Chemical Banking
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But the funds have also had high-profile failures. In late 1996,
the funds bought a large stake in Cityscape Financial, a consumer
finance company that subsequently filed for bankruptcy. And its
holdings of Sunbeam Corp., though acquired for pennies a share when
the company was in bankruptcy proceedings, have lost much of their
value in the last two years amid management turmoil and accounting
problems at that company.
</P>
<P>
   As part of their recommendations for Thermo Electron, the
Franklin managers requested that the company add more independent,
outside directors, preferably executives far younger than the
current group of 12 members, half of whom are older than 70. Five
directors have served on the board for more than 20 years, and 10
are company officers or serve on the board of one of Thermo's
subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The fund managers also sought the removal from the board of John
Hatsopoulos, the chairman's brother and the company's former chief
financial officer. In the proxy statement for the upcoming annual
meeting, Thermo Electron states that it has agreed to pay him
$500,000 annually for the next five years as a consultant. In
addition, he is to be renominated to the board this year and again
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find this action to be irresponsible and certainly not in
the best interest of shareholders,'' the Franklin managers wrote.
``He has had ample time to make his fortune from Thermo Electron.''
</P>
<P>
   The Franklin managers also proposed that Thermo Electron further
reduce the number of its public subsidiaries, focusing ``on markets
where the company holds a clear competitive advantage and market
dominance,'' and borrow money to pay for an ``aggressive
share-buyback program.''
</P>
<P>
   Thermo Electron's financial condition is exactly the type that
often attracts the Franklin Mutual Series funds, which practice the
``value'' style of investing, characterized by searching out
underpriced assets.
</P>
<P>
   While revenues have continued to rise, profits have fallen,
leading the company's share price to decline sharply. Meanwhile,
Thermo Electron's balance sheet is rich with assets, including $1.5
billion in cash _ the equivalent of $8.50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has relatively little long-term debt; it totals
$2 billion, equivalent to a third of total capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our view that a buyback financed with straight debt
would increase earnings per share as well as return on equity,''
the fund managers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Thermo Electron earned $181.9 million, or $1.07 a
share, on revenue of $3.87 billion. Those earnings were down from
$239 million, or $1.41 a share, the previous year, despite an 8.7
percent increase in revenues, from $3.56 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Franklin managers are not the only disgruntled shareholders.
A topic of conversation recently on Internet message boards devoted
to Thermo Electron has been the compensation package for Syron.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to an annual base salary of $800,000, Syron is to
receive guaranteed minimum bonuses in each of his first three years
that average $166,667 a year. He will also receive $200,000 in
Thermo Electron shares in each of the three years and an option to
buy 1 million shares upon taking over as chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Thermo Electron has also agreed to buy Syron's house in the New
York area for $1.5 million and put it up for sale. The price paid
to Syron is subject to adjustment based on the resale value.

NATO PRESSES ON WITH AIR ATTACK AGAINST YUGOSLAVIA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO and U.S. officials stuck to their guns Monday,
promising to continue air strikes against Yugoslavia despite claims
of Serb troop reductions in Kosovo and China's anger over the
bombing of its embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Although heartened by reported plans for the partial pullout of
Serb troops, President Clinton and other alliance officials said
Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic must do more before NATO
will stop the air attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm encouraged by any good word,'' President Clinton said
during an appearance in the White House Rose Garden. ``I think we
have to do better, but any little daylight, any little progress is
better than it was the day before. We just have to bear down and
keep working, and we'll work through it.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO has demanded Yugoslavia stop its offensive against Kosovo's
ethnic Albanians, withdraw all military and police personnel from
the province, and allow refugees to return under the protection of
an armed international peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   The air attacks _ nearing the end of their seventh week _ will
continue ``until those conditions have been fulfilled and fulfilled
in full,'' said NATO spokesman Jamie Shea. ``If President Milosevic
has indeed ordered a withdrawal of his troops this would be proof
NATO's air operations are biting and that Belgrade is feeling the
effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Early Monday, the commander of Yugoslavia's army announced a
partial withdrawal of military and police forces from Kosovo,
saying the Serb-led units have completed their mission against the
Kosovo Liberation Army in the southern Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
   With virtually all foreign reporters forced out of Kosovo since
late March, no independent verification of troop withdrawals was
immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who released a
report Monday indicating that about 90 percent of all ethnic
Albanians have been driven from their homes by Serb forces, was
unimpressed by Milosevic's announced withdrawal of about half the
40,000 troops posted in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a definition of a half measure, that is it,''
Albright said, adding that Milosevic's government must agree to a
``demonstrable, verifiable withdrawal of forces before we would
even consider any kind of a suspension of the bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department report, called ``Erasing History: Ethnic
Cleansing in Kosovo,'' estimates that 1.3 million ethnic Albanians
have been expelled from their homes. Before the war, an estimated
1.8 million ethnic Albanians lived in Kosovo and made up about 90
percent of the population of the province.
</P>
<P>
   Compiled from a variety of sources, including interviews with
refugees, the report ``makes clear beyond any doubt that horrific
patterns of war crimes and crimes against humanity are emerging in
Kosovo: systematic executions, organized rape and well-planned
programs of terror and expulsion,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   About 700,000 of the refugees have fled to other countries _
primarily Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia and Montenegro _
after Serb authorities confiscated any identifying documents such
as passports, birth and marriage certificates, even car tags.
</P>
<P>
   Another 600,000 are living in makeshift shelters in forests and
mountain valleys in central and northeastern Kosovo where they
reportedly are running short of food and medical supplies needed to
stave off disease.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the State Department and the U.S. Agency for
International Development confirmed negotiations were under way
with the Yugoslav government to allow civilian aircraft to drop
supplies to the refugees still in Kosovo. If cleared by NATO
commanders and the Yugoslavs, the airlift could begin within two
weeks, according to officials with both agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Air drops are very difficult to do ... but that is one
strategy we have been working on,'' said Julia Taft, assistant
secretary of state for humanitarian aid. ``But that is the only way
we know we can get in to help these people.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also lists 78 Kosovar villages and towns damaged or
destroyed by Serb forces as they expelled the occupants. It also
documents mass graves found in six villages and the Pagarusa
Valley. The report also cites repeated and consistent refugee
reports of Serbs systematically separating an unknown number of
military-age men from their families. The fate of the men is
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Beijing, Americans holed up inside the U.S. Embassy
for a third day as students protesting Friday's bombing of the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade pelted the compound with rocks, paint
and homemade fire bombs. Late Monday, the State Department reported
that no Americans had been injured.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, embassy officials began shredding sensitive
documents when they became concerned that Beijing police were not
going to prevent protesters from entering the building.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to calling officially for an immediate end to the
bombing in Yugoslavia and busing demonstrators to the U.S. Embassy,
China has suspended high-level discussions with U.S. officials on
weapons proliferation, international security and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials, including Clinton and Albright, on Monday
repeated their earlier apologies for the embassy bombing, which
killed three and injured more than 20 Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again I want to say to the Chinese people and to the leaders
of China, I apologize. I regret this,'' Clinton said as he opened a
White House conference on youth violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very important to remember that this was an
isolated, tragic event, while the `ethnic cleansing' of Kosovo,
which has led to the killing of thousands of people and the
relocation of hundreds of thousands, is a deliberate and systematic
crime,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's apology _ his second in two days _ was not good enough
for China's ambassador to the United States, who called for a
full-scale, international investigation. ``Whoever tried to
whitewash the atrocity as a mistake was wrong,'' said Li Zhaoxing,
calling on the United States ``to severely punish those responsible
for this attack.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just say 'sorry' and walk away without doing anything
else, this will only add to the anger and indignation of the
Chinese people,'' Li said. ``Do they really believe that this is
simply a kind of mistake?''
</P>
<P>
   The bombing of the Chinese Embassy, which military planners
erroneously identified as headquarters for a Yugoslav arms agency,
was the latest in a series of fatal mistakes acknowledged by NATO
since beginning the Balkan air attacks March 24. The mistaken
bombing of a passenger train, a refugee convoy, a public market, a
hospital complex and residential neighborhoods have killed more
than 100 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this particular case, it was not a human error or
mechanical error. It was an institutional error,'' said Secretary
of Defense William Cohen. ``In simple terms, one of our planes
attacked the wrong target because the bombing instructions were
based on an outdated map.''

SPORTS BUSINESS: NEW OWNER AND STADIUM FOR JETS?
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Naturally, the next owner of the Jets will want a new stadium.
It would be the only way to justify a price tag that will probably
exceed $500 million. The late owner Leon Hess never agitated for a
new stadium or squawked that he had a less-than-grand deal at
Giants Stadium, where revenues are split among the Jets, the Giants
and the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Hess was the antithesis of the modern team owner, who plays
cities against each other to win the stadium lottery. If the Jets
were ever displeased with their lease, you never heard it publicly
from Hess or Steve Gutman, the team president. Their typical
response was that the lease was solid through 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Even after meeting with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in January, Hess
never told the news media about the plans he was given for a
stadium on the West Side of Manhattan. Hess, who was planning to
show the city's plans to National Football League officials, was
too ill to schedule a subsequent meeting.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that the Jets need a new stadium to be competitive,
but it would not hurt, especially by 2009 when even more teams will
be in new homes. In the Bill Parcells era, the Jets have shown the
ability to spend what is necessary on players. But as recently as
1996, the Jets were receiving $2 million a year from a special
league fund set up for fiscally needy teams.
</P>
<P>
   So it is difficult to imagine a new owner, whether it might be
Donald Trump or Charles Dolan, the chairman of Cablevision, gladly
paying $500 million without the cash flow afforded by a new
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, whose name has been bandied about as a possible owner,
pulled out of consideration Monday. ``I want to make it known that
I am not part of any group, nor will I ever be part of any group,
that attempts to purchase any equity in the Jets,'' the coach said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Al Lerner, who will start life as the new Cleveland
Browns owner in a new stadium, a new Jets owner will need foresight
to look beyond the Jets' occupation of Giants Stadium through 2008
to a new stadium packed with steeply priced luxury suites and club
seats, plus a cushy naming-rights deal.
</P>
<P>
   What separates the wealthiest NFL teams from the remaining
wealthy teams is the stadium deal. Teams that own their stadiums,
like the Washington Redskins, or those with leases that route
nearly every cent to their bottom lines, like the Browns, emerge as
the league's most valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the difference in stadium revenues in 1998 between the
Jets at 23-year-old Giants Stadium and the Redskins at two-year-old
Jack Kent Cooke Stadium:
</P>
<P>
   The Jets kept about $18.3 million from gate receipts, after
paying rent (about $3.2 million) and the visiting teams' shares
($11.1 million). The Jets received $1.14 million from concessions,
$1.13 million from luxury suites, $900,000 from stadium advertising
and $831,193 from parking.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins performed somewhat better. Their $5.7 million rent
payment went from Corporate Pocket A to Corporate Pocket B.
Estimates of 1998 revenues pegged luxury suite and club-seat fees
at $29.9 million, advertising at $3.8 million, concessions at $2.7
million and parking at $2.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how juicy the Redskins' situation looks _ the
prospective owner, Daniel Snyder, still has about $160 million in
stadium debt to pay _ the Jets will get nothing to compare for many
years.
</P>
<P>
   When Jack Kent Cooke died in April 1997, it took 17 months for
his estate to put the team on the market. But the estate, hamstrung
partly by litigation with Cooke's former wife, did not decide to
sell its largest assets, like the Redskins, until the summer of
1998.
</P>
<P>
   If there are no major obstacles, the Jets' sale should move
faster, especially if Hess' will directs that the team be sold
before other assets or directs it to negotiate with a particular
buyer.
</P>
<P>
   DUVAL AND WOODS, ONE-ON-ONE: Snaring the rights to the
prime-time, $1.5 million Tiger Woods-David Duval exhibition on
Monday, Aug. 2, was crucial for ABC Sports. The network was
approached by the International Management Group six weeks ago,
about the time Howard Katz became the president of ABC Sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make a statement about the new ABC Sports,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, ABC wants to call attention to itself and show that it will
be more active in the sports-rights game. ``We think people will
talk about this in the days before the match and in the days
after,'' Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   But ABC nearly did not get the match. Barry Frank, the senior
corporate vice president of IMG, said that he approached
pay-per-view distributors before calling on the broadcast networks.
He said he was uncertain whether a network would pre-empt
prime-time programming. ``But ABC stepped up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For various reasons, CBS, NBC and Fox passed on the program's
concept or the price. ``We didn't want it in prime time and didn't
think it had a place on our golf schedule,'' said Ed Markey, a
spokesman for NBC Sports.
</P>
<P>
   CBS, NBC and Fox would have incurred heavier costs than ABC to
pre-empt programming. Katz said his bosses did not resist the
rights fee or the cost of replacing one Monday night's prime-time
reruns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were excited about it from the start,'' he said.

FLEET EXECUTIVES WILL DOMINATE BANKBOS-MERGER ERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- When Fleet Financial Group Inc. and BankBoston Corp.
agreed in March to combine into the nation's eighth-largest bank,
their chief executives went to great lengths to describe their
blockbuster transaction as a merger of equals _ despite the fact
that Fleet was technically acquiring its smaller rival.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday, as the two companies announced a second round of key
appointments that again puts many Fleet managers at the top ranks,
the idea of a merger of equals for New England's two largest banks
had all but withered away. Now the rhetoric from Fleet and
BankBoston is about plucking the best parts of each company and
planting them in a new corporate framework.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new appointments, Fleet executives are in charge of
retail and commercial operations at the combined bank, reflecting
Fleet's particular strengths.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston executives are in charge of international banking,
investment banking, and large-scale corporate banking _ areas where
the nation's oldest bank, with Latin American operations, San
Francisco investment bank Robertson Stephens, and an A-list of
corporate clients, has considerable experience.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Fleet executives have around 30 of the new top spots
while their BankBoston counterparts have around 25. Overall, Fleet
now has around 60 percent of the top positions. That weighting
suggests that Fleet is deepening its control of the new bank _ but
not excessively dominating it.
</P>
<P>
   When the two companies first announced their $16 billion deal,
they spoke insistently of a merger of equals, and Gifford took
umbrage at words like ``acquisition'' and ``takeover.''
</P>
<P>
   But from the outset, Fleet moved quickly to put its imprimatur
on the transaction, naming its own managers to most of the very top
positions and placing its chief executive, Terrence Murray, in the
highest spot. Industry analysts, eyeing the two banks' radically
different lines of businesses, spoke of the new company as a
hybrid, not as a union of evenly matched entities.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the latest appointments, Murray said he now
preferred to call the Fleet-BankBoston combination a ``strategic
alliance,'' rather than a merger of equals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're integrating the best of both companies,'' Murray said
Monday by telephone from Providence, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gifford, when asked if he would call the deal a
merger of equals, asked rhetorically, ``What is equal?'' He
continued later: ``This is a merger of our two companies and the
organizational chart reflects that.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of equal vs. dominant is not just semantic. Banking
analysts say the recent appointments and the philosophy behind them
are crucial to success at the new company, which will have more
than $160 billion in assets after divestiture. Executives
disoriented by organizational changes or left in limbo for too long
can torpedo cost-cutting and revenue-building plans by
misunderstanding how the new company fits together. Problems at the
top filter down throughout the organization, causing insecurity
among lower-rank staffers and chaos. In a rapidly consolidating
financial world, neither investors nor consumers are kind to banks
that mangle their mergers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an early and `deep' announcement that sets your whole
infrastructure in place and gets many questions answered,'' said
Sally P. Davis, a banking analyst at Goldman, Sachs Inc.
</P>
<P>
   While industry analysts said Monday they were encouraged by what
they viewed as signs of cooperation between the two very different
banks, Fleet and BankBoston still must prove they can assemble a
powerhouse institution out of disparate parts. Both banks have
swallowed major competitors in recent years but face a strong
challenge in creating a new culture out of their different
corporate approaches. Fleet is generally viewed as aggressive and
hard-nosed, while BankBoston is seen as more sensitive to community
issues.
</P>
<P>
   As previously announced, BankBoston chief executive Chad
Gifford, who is the new company's number two until Murray retires
at the end of 2001, oversees most of the new bank's business lines
and day-to-day operations. Murray, who has said he will turn over
the reins to Gifford after retiring, handles strategy, technology,
finance, and staffing issues.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Higgins, now Fleet's president and chief operating
officer, will oversee retail and commercial banking, reporting to
Gifford. His counterpart at BankBoston, Henrique Meirelles,
overseas global banking and financial services.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, known as a ruthless bottom-line manager, will oversee a
cost-cutting drive designed to trim $600 million from the new
company, which will have nearly $3 billion in income next year, its
first year of operation.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet chief financial officer Eugene McQuade retains his
position after the merger, and reports to Murray.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise appointment, Bradford Warner, in charge of
BankBoston's New England consumer bank and domestic private bank,
will oversee investment services at the new company. But Fleet
executives dominate the individual investment groups under Warner,
including mutual funds, private banking, and Fleet's Quick &AMP; Reilly
discount brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Snowden, head of BankBoston's highly regarded community
banking network, retains her position in the new bank, reporting to
Higgins.
</P>
<P>
   Another rising star is Fleet's Anne Finucane. Now in charge of
corporate communications, marketing, and advertising, she gains
additional duties at the new bank, including government relations,
public policy, and internal communications. Finucane, a close
Murray ally who in an unusual move will report directly to Gifford,
is seen as a key figure in helping the two companies create a new
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hogan, now BankBoston's head of wholesale, or large
corporate, banking, will oversee institutional and investment
banking, reporting to Meirelles. Leo Breitman, now head of Fleet's
commercial banking group, will oversee middle-market commercial
banking, reporting to Higgins.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's chief investment officer, Thomas O'Neill, will continue
in that role, but his BankBoston counterpart, Ned Riley, will not
join the new company, Gifford said. Although not included in
Monday's announcements, Fleet's chief economist, Nicholas Perna,
will have the top slot when a new round of appointments is made in
coming weeks. His BankBoston counterpart, Wayne Ayers, may leave
the combined company, sources familiar with the matter said.
</P>
<P>
   David Eyles, who handles risk management at Fleet, will continue
in that role at the new bank, with his BankBoston counterpart, John
Mastromarino, reporting to him. BankBoston's technology chief,
Joseph Smialowski, will head up technology when his Fleet
counterpart, Michael Zucchini, retires later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the line-up, Gerard Cassidy of Tucker Cleary Inc.
said: ``They each truly picked their best people.''
</P>
<P>
   But the selection process was fraught with quarrel and tension,
and decisions were announced several weeks later than expected.
Several key executives from both banks, including BankBoston
corporate affairs chief Ira Jackson and Fleet Bank of Massachusetts
president John Hamill, agreed during the negotiations to step
aside.
</P>
<P>
   Murray and Gifford wrangled over the appointments for weeks in
five one-on-one sessions, arguing over three points: whether the
investment bank should be part of the global or the corporate
banking unit; whether cash management should be part of commercial
or institutional operations; and whether leasing should be under
commercial finance or somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   While those debates might sound esoteric, they lie at the heart
of the new company's ability to function. Messily structured
business lines can doom the new bank on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``These charts are not really important to the outside world,
but they are terribly important to the inside world,'' explained
Nancy Bush of Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co. ``Until these announcements were
made, you don't know who your boss is going to be, and life
virtually comes to a halt.''
</P>
<P>
   The two banks, which expect to gain regulatory approval for
their merger in the fourth quarter and will eliminate 5,000
positions, will now focus on cost-cutting and revenue-enhancing
plans. Those tasks, likely to be painful and difficult, must be
done well for the new bank to avoid becoming a takeover target.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say so-called mergers of equals rarely work since
they obscure who is in the driver's seat and competitive edges off
strong franchises.
</P>
<P>
   But with Fleet-BankBoston now clear about who is in control and
which parts of each bank will survive, the new company has dropped
the mergers of equal line in favor of one reflecting differences
betweeen the two banks.
</P>
<P>
   Said Murray: ``This reflects the core strengths of each
company.''

U.S. LOSES HOLD ON SUBMARINE-EXPOSING RADAR TECHNIQUE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Reorganizes for sharper focus, harder lead.)  
 (ATTN: Calif., Va., Okla., Mass.)  (jw) 
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Secrets that China stole in 1997 about a space radar that can
expose submerged submarines could aid it in finding subs from
commercial satellites or airplanes, and might also help it hide its
own undersea weapons, intelligence experts say.
</P>
<P>
   For two decades, seeking to protect its submarine fleet from
such surveillance, the Pentagon has tried to monopolize the radar.
When it made its debut in 1978 with surprising powers of
discernment, military officials blocked public release of satellite
photos that showed deep, normally invisible wakes of speeding
craft.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the military had the federal government set strict
limits on the visual powers of proposed commercial radar
satellites. And this year, the Pentagon is fighting a Canadian plan
to loft a radar satellite that would break the new American rules.
</P>
<P>
   Now it turns out, according federal officials, that an American
scientist gave radar secrets to China in 1997, forcibly easing the
Pentagon's grip. The implications of this disclosure are unclear,
because the size of the breach is unknown publicly and because the
secret method is reportedly difficult to put into practice, even
after years of study.
</P>
<P>
   But at worst, experts say, American subs are now in danger of
losing some of their cover. Among the vulnerable are missile subs,
the most important part of the nation's nuclear arsenal because of
their stealthiness.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, the unanswered questions include how deep submarines
must go to elude radar prying, how sea currents and temperatures
can help restore invisibility and how technical advances with
submarines, satellites and computers will most likely affect such
probing in the future. Today the radar technique is believed to be
able to uncloak submarines hundreds of feet beneath the waves, but
not thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that recent trends have already hurt the Pentagon's
game, and that China's espionage, at least in theory, has made
things worse.
</P>
<P>
   A menacing trend is the advent of commercial radar satellites,
which sell their images to anyone with a credit card. Canada has
one in orbit and wants another, more powerful. An American company
is building one, though the strict new Federal rules forced it to
limit its original goals.
</P>
<P>
   As for China, it could use the stolen technology not only to
hunt foreign subs but also to better cloak its own submarines,
finding ways to reduce the deep wakes that produce subtle clues of
stealthy movement.
</P>
<P>
   Angelo Codevilla, a professor of international relations at
Boston University who has worked on the staff of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, said the Chinese would most easily and
plausibly use the secrets to change the depth and speed of their
submarines.
</P>
<P>
   Secret knowledge of ``what we can and cannot do,'' he said,
could help the Chinese dodge submarine spying.

<P>
   Since the start of the space age, most satellites have observed
the Earth with cameras similar in principle to any tourist's. In
1978, however, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
launched a new kind of satellite that made images by bouncing radio
waves off the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Seasat, this radar craft saw land and sea in striking
new ways, its images revealing narrow lines in the ocean _ tracings
left by the passage of ships and subs. It somehow managed to
distinguish signs of deep turbulence from the regular froth and
heave of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Seasat's feats came to an abrupt end in 1978 when the spacecraft
failed unexpectedly after 100 days, with the Pentagon deeply
ambivalent about its discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was concern about what we had done,'' recalled Gene
Giberson, the project manager for Seasat at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Russians flew nuclear-powered radar satellites
to spy on the oceans, the Pentagon _ the Navy in particular _ was
loath to look closely at the phenomenon, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Navy resisted,'' said Dave McCurdy, a former chairman of
the House Intelligence Committee and an Oklahoma Democrat. ``They
didn't want questions raised. There is a certain orthodoxy they
didn't want challenged.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, in the early 1980s, Congress forced the issue,
setting up a research program independent of the Navy that had the
issue closely investigated. In 1988, inspired by Seasat, the
nation's spy agencies launched their first radar satellite.
</P>
<P>
   McCurdy, now president of the Electronic Industries Association,
in Arlington, Va., said the research program found deep-sub imaging
``an incredibly difficult challenge'' that, among other things,
required ``a lot of computing power.''
</P>
<P>
   However, progress was sufficient that Britain and the United
States kept up the investigations in the 1990s in a joint program.
Richard Twogood, the program's technical leader, based at Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, a weapons lab in California, told
Congress in 1994 of the discovery of phenomena that ``appear to be
very important to the sensing of surface effects produced by
undersea disturbances.''
</P>
<P>
   Twogood also complained that the Defense Department was
withholding funds for the research.
</P>
<P>
   It was he who told federal investigators that the radar
information given China by Peter Lee, an American scientist, was
``classified and sensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   A high-ranking Navy submariner said the force was ``not worried
about'' the Chinese espionage because the detection technology was
``still of such limited practical use.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Pentagon is facing not only Chinese spying but also
the global debut of commercial radar satellites, raising knotty
issues.
</P>
<P>
   RDL Space Corp., in Culver City, Calif., wanted a federal
license for a satellite with one-meter resolution, or about three
feet.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington, at the Pentagon's request, said the company
could sell imagery with resolution no greater than five meters, or
about 16 feet. Last June RDL won a federal license for that
sensitivity. It plans to launch its satellite in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Canada, however, is planning to overstep that boundary with a
radar satellite that has a resolution of three meters, or about 10
feet. Federal officials, at the Pentagon's request, are now trying
to talk Canada into a less sensitive aim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other agencies are looking at this,'' said Charles Wooldridge,
the head of satellite licensing at the Commerce Department. ``It's
a national security issue.''  &QL;

SELECTING TARGETS A   COMPLEX, UNCERTAIN PROCEDURE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Three days after US pilots bombed the Chinese Embassy, thinking
it was a Yugoslav weapons agency, the reason seems to be a case of
the left hand not knowing what the right hand was doing.
</P>
<P>
   The key mistake was that the maps of Belgrade on which the US
targeteers relied _ drawn up in 1992, but reexamined as recently as
last year _ did not show that the embassy had moved to its current
location.
</P>
<P>
   A senior intelligence official, briefing reporters at the
Pentagon Monday, said that, to prevent such mishaps in the future,
the State Department will now be ``forwarding, more routinely,
information about embassies'' and their changes of address.
</P>
<P>
   So is the State Department to blame for not telling the Pentagon
that the Chinese Embassy had moved?
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily. Until very recently, Yugoslavia was not a
country that the Pentagon had planned on bombing. No US military
command had a ``target list'' for Belgrade _ as the Strategic Air
Command once had for cities in the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact
(Yugoslavia was never a member).
</P>
<P>
   The US charge and his diplomatic staff in Belgrade would
probably have known the location of the Chinese embassy. The CIA
station chief would have certainly known. But it would not have
been an automatic procedure to pass along this bit of intelligence
to Air Force targeteers. Nor would it have been standard procedure
for the Air Force targeteers to ask.
</P>
<P>
   The senior intelligence official said analysts have gone back
over the archive of data, to see if anything was overlooked. ``We
have not found any reports to the data base that the Chinese
Embassy had moved,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   This ``data base'' is the vast file of information gathered,
processed, and put together by a variety of Western _ primarily US
_ intelligence agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force's National Reconaissance Office operates the fleet
of spy satellites, snapping and transmitting photographs as they
spin.
</P>
<P>
   The National Imagery and Mapping Agency turns these photos into
maps.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Intelligence Agency, a branch of the Air Force in
Arlington, Va., identifies certain buildings and other objects on
these maps as targets. Key targets would include military
headquarters, barracks, command-control centers, and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   This process of identifying targets is aided by the National
Security Agency, which intercepts electronic transmissions, phone
lines, and other methods of communication.
</P>
<P>
   As targets are identified, special analysts at the Air
Intelligence Agency try to infer the structure of the targets and
what kinds of weapons would be needed to destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   This information is passed along to NATO's Combined Air
Operations Center in Italy, which assigns munitions to planes and
planes to targets.
</P>
<P>
   But all this, apparently, was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   John Pike, a private weapons and intelligence specialist at the
Federation of American Scientists, said: ``I've looked at enough
overhead photographs of rooftops to see you've still got to have
someone with a notebook or a camera, walking around, knocking the
pavement.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, partly because of strained relations between
the United States and Yugoslavia, partly because Belgrade was not
considered a logical target of US bombing anyway, there may not
have been enough people knocking the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can imagine last summer, someone figuring Belgrade might be
a target at some point,'' Pike said. ``I can imagine someone
saying, `How many guys can we send to do walking tours without the
security police getting suspicious?' Maybe enough to look at things
we were going to hit _ but maybe not looking at all the things we
didn't want to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior intelligence official at the Pentagon Monday seemed
to support Pike's imaginings. ``Nobody was going out looking for
the Chinese embassy,'' he said.

HOUSE TENTATIVELY OKs BILL TO LOWER LEGAL INTOXICATION LIMIT FORBy JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, TEXAS _ With families of drunk-driving victims looking
on, the Texas House on Monday tentatively approved a bill to lower
the legal intoxication limit for drivers from .10 percent to .08
percent of blood alcohol content.
</P>
<P>
   If final House approval comes Tuesday as expected, the
hard-fought proposal from the Senate would go to Gov. George W.
Bush for his promised signature, making Texas the 17th state to use
the tougher standard advocated by groups including Mothers Against
Drunk Driving.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the change should have a measurable impact on
highway safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is about saving lives and about saving millions of
dollars in property damage,'' said sponsoring Rep. Scott Hochberg,
D-Houston. ``We can do that by lowering the DWI limit by just one
drink in five,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature's move to lower alcohol level to .08 percent
failed in the 1997 session due to a last-minute parliamentary
maneuver in the Senate. But this session there was no such
obstacle, although some lawmakers and members of the public weren't
convinced the change would drastically reduce drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Scripps Howard Texas Poll indicated that most citizens
favored the change, although 60 percent also doubted whether the
crackdown would actually translate to fewer alcohol-related deaths,
injuries and damage.
</P>
<P>
   If signed by Bush, the new limit would take effect Sept. 1 and
apply to offenses committed on or after that date.
</P>
<P>
   Hochberg said the measure, Senate Bill 116 by Sen. Mario
Gallegos, D-Galena Park, would help Texas end its dubious top
national ranking for alcohol-related deaths. Nearly 1,750 people
died in Texas in alcohol-related accidents in 1997, the latest year
statistics are available.
</P>
<P>
   One study suggested that lowering the level could cause a
double-digit drop in road fatalities, as it did in California and
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Experts testified in committee that to remain under the .08
blood-alcohol level, a typical 170-pound man could drink no more
than four drinks in one hour on an empty stomach. A 120-pound woman
could drink an estimated three drinks.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was opposed by only one group in the House hearing _
the American Beverage Institute, which represents the liquor
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals by Rep. Harold Dutton, D-Houston, to lower the level
even further _ to zero and .05 percent _ were defeated
overwhelmingly. Hochberg and others said those levels were too
stringent. Some members raised questions about whether churchgoers
who tasted wine, or people who took certain medicines, could be
charged with DWI under Dutton's zero tolerance proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should draw the line in the dirt today,'' Dutton argued
unsuccessfully.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the lower blood-alcohol content legislation said it
would not only save lives but help Texas qualify for $12.4 million
in federal incentives to fight drunken driving. The grants from the
National Highway Safety Administration could be used for highway
safety and construction.

AIDING STUDENTS TO GO OVERSEAS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 16) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Minn., N.Y., Maine)   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The number of U.S. college students going overseas for part of
their undergraduate work is rising, and has been rising for some
years. At Carleton College in Northfield, Minn., where the director
of off-campus study says courses overseas are ``part of the
undergraduate experience, part of conversation at dinner,'' 310
students joined foreign study programs in 1997-98; this was 17
percent of a student body of 1,858.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation at Carleton is not typical. Nationwide, the
total of almost 100,000 students who participated in overseas
programs in 1996-97 represented about 1 percent of the 8.7 million
students enrolled in colleges granting bachelor's degrees The
increase continued steady _ 10,206, or 11 percent, in 1996-97, the
most recent available figures.
</P>
<P>
   These statistics worry the president of the organization that
gathers them, the Institute of International Education in New York,
a major nonprofit organization that works for international student
exchanges and manages many such programs. The president, Allen E.
Goodman, says that the glass is not half full but half empty.
</P>
<P>
   He says students need to study overseas to prepare to work and
compete in the world market. The country's commerce and
international relations, he maintains, will depend heavily on how
familiar graduates are with the world, its languages, history and
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman sees a number of trends converging: a decrease in the
study of foreign languages in high school, the evidently small
number of students _ 5 or 10 percent _ who arrive at college with
passports, and the popularity of English-speaking countries for
overseas study: a quarter of enrollments are in England, Ireland
and Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   But the oncoming steamroller he sees is the Internet. ``English
is the language of the Internet,'' he said, ``and this makes people
think they are closer than they are.'' They think, he said, that
because they have communicated with someone in the Middle East that
they know about the Middle East, but they don't.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman and the Institute for International Education are
starting several projects to encourage students to go overseas as
undergraduates. In cooperation with the State Department, he is
working on a ``let's get a passport'' project for high school
students. Information on getting application forms from the
Internet will be provided. ``If they have passports,'' he said,
``they will figure out how to use them.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that by the time a student is a college sophomore,
getting a birth certificate from home may be complicated. He has
persuaded the University of California at Los Angeles to add a
question about passport possession to its national survey of
college freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Iseminger, the director of off-campus study at Carleton,
said that the overseas programs her college sponsored cost no more
than on-campus enrollment, except that students must pay to travel
to foreign countries instead of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   At Colby College in Waterville, Maine, where semesters overseas
are also a major attraction, the head of off-campus study,
Professor Jon Weiss, said that a student's cost for a semester
overseas in one of the Colby's own programs is the same as the
regular comprehensive fee at home. This includes air fare to the
overseas site, Salamanca, Spain; Dijon, France, or London.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss said some of these subsidized the others: the round-trip
fare to Spain recently, for example, was $900, more than twice the
fare to London.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman said that in the new effort he would also be seeking
channels for money for students who cannot manage the cost:
churches, community centers, corporations. Figures gathered by
William W. Hoffa for a new book, ``Study Abroad, a Parent's
Guide,'' show that at private colleges where financial aid packages
may be applied to study overseas, participation by nonwhite
students increases.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Spring is the time students begin looking at programs for a year
hence, particularly checking the ones conducted by their own
colleges, although the junior year is no longer the only chance for
study overseas. Half of the enrollments are by juniors, 16 percent
by seniors and 12 percent by sophomores.
</P>
<P>
   At Colby, a college of 1,760, about 57 percent of juniors spend
a semester overseas, but the college also has 67 to 70 students who
start college overseas. By graduation, Weiss said, 70 percent of
the class has had an ``abroad experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many colleges, Colby charges a fee to students who sign up
for programs sponsored by other schools; its fee is $1,000,
measured against the $29,000 comprehensive fee. Nationwide, about
two-thirds select their own school's programs, or those directed by
a consortium to which their college belongs.
</P>
<P>
   There are two main reference works for overseas courses, both
large, heavy paperback books: ``Peterson's Study Abroad 1999,'' a
guide to 1,700 semester and year-abroad courses, and ``Academic
Year Abroad 1999-2000,'' edited by Sara J. Steen and published by
the Institute of International Education, covering 2,700 programs.
Most colleges have these in the library. They can also be bought
from bookstores or directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Academic Year Abroad,'' is available from the Institute of
International Education, 809 United Nations Plaza, New York, NY
10017; (800) 445-0443. The publisher sells it for $42.95, plus $6
for shipping. For ``Study Abroad,'' contact Peterson's, 202
Carnegie Center, P.O. Box 2123, Princeton, NJ 08543; (800)
338-3282. This sells for $29.95.
</P>
<P>
   Neither organization evaluated the specific programs it lists.
Many decisions are based on whether the student's college will
provide credit for a course; both books have caveats on this issue
along with information on passports, health, getting around,
identification cards and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa's ``Parent's Guide'' is a valuable smaller book that
breaks the issue down into useful bites. It covers everything from
selecting a course to the child's safety. The historical survey and
statistics of all sorts clarify the questions to be asked before
decisions are made.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa and Goodman do not always agree, but are in harmony when
it comes to the Internet. ``Telecommunications can interfere with
students' cultural adjustment,'' Hoffa said. ``Sometimes in cases
of homesickness, a call to Mom or an e-mail to a friend allows the
students to avoid the need to adjust to the local environment.
Until that umbilical cord is cut, there is no rebirth.''
</P>
<P>
   His book, which came out a year ago, is not in bookstores. The
publisher, the Association of International Educators, 1875
Connecticut Ave., N.W., Suite 1000, Washington, DC 20009, sells it
for $15 plus $5 shipping.
</P>
<P>
   High school students too go abroad. One resource for organized
programs is the Advisory List of the Council on Standards for
International Educational Travel, which will appear in its
1999-2000 edition this summer. It offers evaluations, but only of
programs that ask for it and pay a fee.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the programs focus on bringing students into the
United States. Copies are $15, domestic postage included, from
CSIET, 212 Henry St., Alexandria, VA 22314; (703) 739-9050.

 &HT;    And the Grimmy goes to...a convict?
 &HT;    By Tom Beyerlein
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The Miami Valley's outstanding adult literacy
student of 1999 won't be able to pick up his Grimmy Award in person
at today's fourth annual ceremonies because he has a prior
commitment _ in the Montgomery County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   Project READ, the local literacy umbrella group, is honoring Hal
Trevor Lutz for improving his reading from a fourth-grade to a
seventh-grade level just since October.
</P>
<P>
   The Grimmy Award, named after a character in the Mother Goose &AMP;
Grimm comic strip, honors students and tutors in adult basic
educational programs.
</P>
<P>
   Lutz, 35, is the first jail inmate to receive a Grimmy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will not be able to make it (to the ceremony),'' said jail
spokeswoman Sanita Branch. ``Federal prisoners don't leave our
facility without the accompaniment of federal agents, and I doubt
they'd be interested in taking him to accept an award, no matter
how highly they may think of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lutz is awaiting sentencing by U.S. District Judge Walter H.
Rice after pleading guilty to a count of conspiracy to distribute
cocaine, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years to life in
prison and a fine of $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   He has been in jail since February 1998, when Drug Enforcement
Agency officials arrested him on charges of running drugs and money
from Chicago to Dayton as part of a cocaine ring. Agents found 39
kilograms of cocaine and $314,000 in cash in Lutz's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Ten other people were charged with being part of the conspiracy.
In all, nearly $1.3 million in cash and more than 85 pounds of
cocaine were seized in connection with the drug ring, the largest
such seizure ever in southeastern Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest was a turning point for Lutz, who has a wife and two
sons in his home state of California, according to his tutor,
Americorps member Anne Banerjee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says in his (acceptance) speech he didn't hit rock bottom,
but he got a wakeup call,'' said Banerjee, who was to accept the
award on Lutz's behalf today.
</P>
<P>
   Lutz was willing to be interviewed, but his attorney's
permission could not be secured in time to arrange an interview in
jail on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Banerjee said Lutz's progress has been ``just phenomenal. He's
gone from stumbling over words to reading pretty fluently. This is
a guy who never touched a book. Now he just devours books _ I give
him one and he's done in two days and wants another one.''
</P>
<P>
   Karla Hibbert-Jones, executive director of Project READ, said
literacy officials had some qualms about honoring Lutz because they
didn't want to give the impression that people with literacy
problems tend to be criminals. Criminals do, however, tend to be
uneducated _ 75 percent of Ohio prisoners lack a high school
diploma or its equivalent.
</P>
<P>
   But Lutz ``truly stood out in terms of what he accomplished
academically,'' Hibbert-Jones said. ``He clearly was the
outstanding (student), in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   A family member will take custody of the award until Lutz is
released.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably won't let him keep it in jail,'' Hibbert-Jones
said, ``because it could be used as a weapon. It's a big glass
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lutz, who quit school after sixth grade, hopes to get his
General Educational Development high school equivalency diploma
and, eventually, a degree in culinary arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to have a long time to get his GED,'' Hibbert-Jones
said.

EMBASSY BOMBING IMPEDES DEALS ON KOSOVO AND CHINA TRADE STATUS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade
threatens to drag out a diplomatic solution in Kosovo and to sour
an already-troubled relationship with China, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Although administration officials were confident at first that
the crisis would soon blow over, they now see signs that the
Chinese government will delay a U.N. Security Council resolution
requiring an international security force in Kosovo, a senior
administration official said. That resolution is at the heart of a
proposed diplomatic settlement to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than vetoing such a resolution outright, the Chinese
signaled Monday that they would try to obstruct the
administration's diplomatic strategy by demanding that NATO halt
its bombing against Yugoslavia before the Security Council could
consider any other action on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations on Monday, the Chinese ambassador, Qin
Huasun, said that suspending the air strikes was an essential
precondition to any discussion by the Security Council on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything short of that is impossible for the U.N. Security
Council to discuss any plan to solve the problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing may also imperil negotiations over the entry of
China into the World Trade Organization. Anti-Western officials in
Beijing are using the embassy bombing to make their case against
economic concessions that Prime Minister Zhu Rongji offered during
his trip to Washington last month.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Chinese would benefit from entry into the trade
organization, the Clinton administration has based much of its
strategy for improved relations with China on extending economic
ties. But just as anti-Americanism is riding high in Beijing,
anti-Chinese anger is simmering on Capitol Hill among those who
believe that Washington as been too lax on security and should not
be abetting China's grand entry onto the world economic stage..
</P>
<P>
   A deal with the Chinese on their entry into the trade group
needed to be accomplished in the next few months when Congress
would be most amenable, officials said Monday. But the events of
the last few days have jeopardized the administration's hope for a
speedy timetable.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, concerned that the Chinese continue to refuse
his explanation that the bombing was a mistake, apologized for the
third time Monday. He sent a letter to the Chinese president, Jiang
Zemin, Sunday and publicly expressed regrets Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say to the Chinese people and to the leaders of
China, I apologize. I regret this,'' Clinton said in remarks before
a ceremony on youth and violence at the White House, after China
demanded that the United States apologize.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic, used the
crisis over the air strike to pile more pressure on the
administration by announcing a partial withdrawal of his forces
from Kosovo. The announcement did not state how many of his
estimated nearly 50,000 troops in Kosovo would be removed.
</P>
<P>
   There were differences in tone in the reaction of various
Clinton officials. The secretary of state, Madeleine Albright,
dismissed the announcement as a ``half-measure.'' Clinton said,
``I'm encouraged by any good word.'' But he insisted, like other
NATO officials who were cautious in their reaction, that other
terms must be met to reach a settlement. ``I think that the
conditions that we set out are the minimal ones to make this
work,'' the president added.
</P>
<P>
   As the administration worked at holding its Kosovo policy
together, the Russian envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin, arrived in
Beijing to talk to Chinese officials about Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, who is looked upon by the administration as one of
the best hopes for pushing a diplomatic solution with Milosevic,
changed his travel plans after the embassy strike and headed for
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said they assumed that because
the Russians were eager to play a predominant role in finding a
solution in Kosovo, Chernomyrdin would encourage the Chinese to be
reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the image of senior officials of two anti-NATO
countries, China and Russia, meeting over Kosovo, the place where
NATO's future hangs in the balance, was a little unsettling for
administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the officials said, they were confident
Chernomyrdin would ask the Chinese not to block a Security Council
resolution on the international security force.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Russians, the United Nations is an important venue,
and it's important for them to argue back home that they've brought
this issue back to the United Nations and out of the hands of
NATO,'' a Russia expert in the administration said. ``I think their
position to the Chinese is going to be: `Don't screw up the
possibility of a Security Council resolution. Let's try and get it
closer to our terms.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council became a pivotal part of the solution
in Kosovo last week when the seven richest industrial countries and
Russia agreed in Germany to a set of principles that would end the
war.
</P>
<P>
   Among the principles was an international security force for
which Russia and the seven countries said they would seek to get a
U.N. mandate.
</P>
<P>
   When NATO accidentally bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade,
the strategy for a Security Council mandate was put in jeopardy
because of China's veto power. Beijing illustrated how it could use
that veto earlier this year when it vetoed the continuation of a
U.N. force patrolling in Macedonia.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said during the
weekend that he believed the Chinese would not exercise their veto
on the international force.
</P>
<P>
   Berger argued that the Chinese have been against the NATO
bombing since its start. ``Vetoing the force would put them in the
position of wanting to prolong the bombing and being against
peace,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   But others in the administration were not so sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hoping to get the ball rolling in New York at the
United Nations this week but that has all been put off,'' said a
State Department official. ``The question is how far has this set
us back and for how long. Whether the Chinese will calm down in a
week or two is not at all clear.'
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council met for two hours Monday to discuss the
bombing of the embassy but came to no conclusion on a Chinese draft
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese wanted the council to adopt a statement condemning
the bombing as a ``blatant encroachment on the sovereignty of a UN
member state.'' It asked NATO to ensure that ``all individuals
responsible for the incident be brought to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement was supported by Russia and Namibia and opposed by
five NATO members of the Council: the United States, Britain,
France, Canada and the Netherlands. All council statements, formal
or informal, require the agreement of all 15 members of the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the issue of Kosovo, the White House was faced with
repairing damage to the foundation of its relationship with
Beijing, one that Clinton has tried to cultivate as a legacy of his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Some administration officials took heart from the fact that the
policy of engagement and the two summit meetings by the two leaders
in the past two years meant that there was some depth from which to
work. But others said they were concerned that the anti-Americanism
unleashed by the embassy bombing portended for great difficulties
in restoring a semblance of trust.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the embassy also occurred at a trying time in
China's domestic politics _ when unemployment is soaring, the
conservatives are challenging the modernizers and the 10th
anniversary of the killings of hundreds of protesters in Tiananmen
Square looms next month.
</P>
<P>
   China's suspension of high-level military ties, and talks over
arms control, international security and human rights in protest of
the bombing meant that contacts between Washington and Beijing were
at their lowest since 1995 when relations plummeted over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The suspended meetings covered issues that the Clinton
Administration cares greatly about: accusations that China has
provided nuclear weapons or missile technology to Pakistan and
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   To show its pique, China called off a visit by the Boston
Symphony Orchestra and curtailed a visit by the German Chancellor,
Gerhard Schroeder. In another sign of irritation, when the White
House suggested that Clinton would like to call Zemin to express
his condolences, the Chinese said they would prefer that Clinton
send a letter.
</P>
<P>
   The president said in the letter that he looked forward to
speaking to him ``when he is ready,'' the White House spokesman,
Joe Lockhart said.

SHEL SILVERSTEIN, 67, ENCHANTING POET FOR CHILDREN, DIES 
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to correct age to 67 sted 68 in lede)   By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shel Silverstein, whose goofy, gross and macabre yet always
enchanting poetry for children sold more than 14 million books, was
found dead Monday morning at his home in Key West, Fla. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the time nor cause of death had been determined Monday
afternoon, said Shel Vidibor, his friend and lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   While Silverstein's talents led him into a diverse series of
careers as a cartoonist, playwright, singer and song writer, it was
his children's verses that are best known and often compared with
masters of the form like Dr. Seuss and A.A. Milne.
</P>
<P>
   His collections of children's poetry, ``Where the Sidewalk Ends:
The Poems and Drawings of Shel Silverstein'' (Harper, 1974) and ``A
Light in the Attic'' (Harper 1981), both enjoyed long runs on the
best-seller ists.
</P>
<P>
   Silverstein was also the author of the children's classic ``The
Giving Tree'' (Harper, 1964).
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his writings for children, he contributed
cartoons to Playbody magazine for many years and wrote nine plays
for adults. In 1988, when several of those plays were packaged as
``Wild Life'' and were produced at the Vanguard Theater in
Manhattan, Frank Rich, in his review in The New York Times,
suggested that playwrighting ``may eventually prove his most
fruitful career to date.''
</P>
<P>
   Silverstein's career as a children's author began in 1963 with
the publication of ``Uncle Shelby's Story of Lafcadio, the Lion Who
Shot Back'' (Harper).
</P>
<P>
   This yarn about a lion who acquired a hunter's gun and practiced
until he became a good enough shot to join the circus, was only a
moderate success. It was not until publication of ``The Giving
Tree,'' a story about a tree that surrenders its shade, fruit,
branches and finally its trunk to a boy in order to make him happy,
that Silverstein developed a mass following.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, when he published the collection of poems called
``Where the Sidewalk Ends,'' his work was compared to that of Dr.
Seuss and Edward Lear.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of silliness and sophisticated word play in
Silverstein's poetry is illustrated by the poem ``Eggs Rated'' in
the collection ``Falling Up'' (HarperCollins, 1997). Here, the
syllable ``ex'' is wittily replaced by ``egg,'' as in ``Eggstra
fluffy,/Eggstremely tasty/Cooked eggsactly right . . .'' But those
eggs are ``much more eggspensive than I eggspected.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the poems reflect a ghoulish taste that children
tolerate better than many adults. In the poem ``Safe,'' also in the
collection ``Falling Up,'' a child preparing to cross a street
carefully looks to one side and then the other before confidently
proceeding oblivious to a steel safe hurtling down from the
heavens.
</P>
<P>
   Silverstein, who maintained residences on Matha's Vineyard,
Mass.; Key West; Greenwich Village, and on a houseboat in
Sausalito, Calif., refused the grant interviews in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby Silverstein was born in Chicago in 1932, and backed his
way into publishing. ``When I was a kid _ 12 to 14, around there _
I would much rather have been a good baseball player or a hit with
the girls,'' he once told a reporter for Publishers Weekly. ``But I
couldn't play ball. I couldn't dance. Luckily, the girls didn't
want me. Not much I could do about that. So I started to draw and
to write. By the time I got to where I was attracting girls, I was
already into work, and it was more important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s Silverstein served with the United States armed
forces in Japan and Korea and began drawing cartoons for Stars and
Stripes, the American military publication.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to the United States, he began drawing cartoons
for Playboy magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from his cartoons, Silverstein began writing songs in the
country-western style. In 1969 one of these, ``A Boy Named Sue,''
was made a hit for the singer Johnny Cash. In 1980 Silverstein
recorded a country music album called ``The Great Conch Train
Robbery.''
</P>
<P>
   Silverstein is survived by his son, Matthew, and a sister, Peggy
Myers of Chicago.

LOUIMA SAYS MEDICATION LED HIM TO LIE IN POLICE BRUTALITY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: 2nd take is scheduled to move within 30 minutes.) 
(nk) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Abner Louima endured a grueling day of
cross-examination Monday by defense lawyers, who hammered away at
lies he had admitted to telling and conflicts in his various
accounts of his alleged beating and torture by four police officers
in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Louima, a 32-year-old Haitian immigrant, calmly responded by
attributing some of the conflicts to a memory clouded by medication
in the days after he was injured, and said it was ``my choice'' to
follow a supporter's advice to falsely tell a grand jury that one
officer said, ``This is Giuliani time,'' during the alleged
assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time I give evidence before the grand jury, I was under
medication and my memory, it wasn't clear like it is now,'' Louima
said.
</P>
<P>
   Answering a lawyer representing one of the officers, who had
demanded to know ``why your testimony is different today than it
was when you testified for the grand jury,'' Louima said, ``Now I
am not really worried too much about my health.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Louima suffered injuries to his rectum and
bladder after he was beaten and tortured after his arrest in a
street melee in 1997. Referring to those injuries, Louima said of
his answers at this trial: ``I don't have to carry a colostomy bag,
like I was thinking maybe I have to carry for the rest of my life.
I am more peaceful now. I have a better chance to think.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Marvyn M. Kornberg, responded sarcastically, ``You
were peaceful enough to commit perjury in the grand jury, weren't
you?''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange came as Kornberg, who represents Officer Justin A.
Volpe, cited several falsehoods and a series of inconsistencies in
the accounts Louima gave to state and federal grand juries and
investigators and to the media in the months after he was
reportedly brutalized.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe and three other officers are on trial in the racially
charged case in federal court in Brooklyn. The four officers,
charged with violating Louima's civil rights, are white; Louima is
black.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the officers are accused of beating Louima in a police
car after his arrest; Volpe and another officer are charged with
torturing him in a restroom at the 70th Precinct stationhouse.
</P>
<P>
   In a day of relentless questioning, Kornberg did not ask Louima
to respond to Kornberg's most explosive suggestion in the trial:
that Louima's injuries were not the result of Volpe ramming a stick
into his rectum, as the prosecution says, but by a consensual sex
act with another man before Louima encountered the officers.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg later declined to say why he had not asked Louima about
this. But there was no doubt that Louima would have denied the
suggestion, and Kornberg has already indicated, in his opening
arguments to the jury last week, that he intended to support the
suggestion through testimony by medical experts who would tell the
jury that a sex act was consistent was Louima's injuries.

UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN LAUNCHES FULL-SCALE DEFENSE OF AFFIRMATIVE

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANN ARBOR, Mich. _ All over the campus of the University of
Michigan, the signs of a racially and ethnically eclectic student
body abound.
</P>
<P>
   The student union is home to the Asubuhi (``morning'' in
Swahili) Multicultural Lounge. The bulletin board outside lists 49
ethnic organizations. In the cafeteria, Pedro Cox-Alomar, a black
Hispanic junior from San Juan, Puerto Rico, shares breakfast with
his buddy Karl Benkert, white, from rural Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   University officials say it is no accident that racial and
ethnic minorities account for more than 25 percent of the
university's 36,000 students, a statistic that makes this the most
diverse of any large university in the Midwest. The mix results
from aggressive recruitment of minorities and, in some cases,
advantages to black and Hispanic applicants in the highly
competitive admissions process.
</P>
<P>
   Disproportionate advantages, contend some critics who note, for
example, that the admissions point system gives more weight to
being black or Hispanic than to getting a perfect score on the
Scholastic Assessment Tests. (The university points out that far
greater weight is given to high school grades than to either of
those factors.)
</P>
<P>
   The institution's policy is now the target of two lawsuits by a
total of three rejected white applicants, all turned down, they
say, because of their race. So has the University of Michigan
become yet another front in the war over affirmative action,
following the rollback of race-conscious admissions policies at
universities in California and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But what distinguishes the Michigan case is the university's
full-throated counteroffensive: the marshaling of statistical
evidence of what it considers the benefits of racial diversity.
Unlike California and Texas, which defended their policies with
only anecdotal evidence, Michigan has compiled data, on its
students and others, showing that five years after graduation,
collegians who were exposed to a diverse student body are more
likely to work in integrated settings, live in integrated
neighborhoods and have friends of another race.
</P>
<P>
   Data from one of a variety of studies gathered by Michigan in
response to the suits show that 92 percent of the university's
white students and 52 percent of its black students come from
segregated neighborhoods. Yet large numbers of seniors report
interaction with members of other racial groups during their time
at the university.
</P>
<P>
   For example, more than 80 percent of white seniors report some
level of interaction with Asian students, and 65 percent of white
seniors say they have had substantial or some level of interaction
with black students. Most students say their interaction with
members of another race has been positive.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Patricia Gurin, a professor of psychology and women's
studies at the university, concluded in one report that five years
after graduation, whites who had attended colleges with the most
diverse student bodies experienced the greatest growth in active
thinking processes, in motivation to achieve and in intellectual
self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research confirms what we have experienced firsthand as
educators: that diversity enhances learning,'' said Lee Bollinger,
the university's president. ``Encountering those who are different
allows our students to learn about each other's similarities and
differences and to destroy stereotypes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan defense stems from an emerging strategy by
affirmative action's defenders to make an empirical case for it,
rather than a purely emotional or intuitive one. The university's
research follows a survey issued last fall by two former Ivy League
presidents, William G. Bowen of Princeton and Derek Bok of Harvard,
that was based on the records and experiences of 45,000 students
over 20 years at 28 elite colleges around the country. The
Bowen-Bok research concluded that affirmative action policies at
those colleges had created the backbone of the black middle class
and taught white classmates the value of integration.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Michigan plaintiffs maintain that however noble
the idea of creating a diverse university, Michigan is blatantly
discriminating against whites to achieve it. They allege violation
of the Constitution's equal-protection guarantees, among other
protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that discrimination always hurts someone,'' said
Barbara Grutter, a 45-year-old mother of two who was rejected by
Michigan's law school in 1997 &UR; . &LR;  ``I don't know how we can have a
country that says discrimination is wrong and yet have all these
exceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits _ one against Michigan's law school, and another
against its undergraduate college _ were filed in the U.S. District
Court for the Eastern District, in Detroit, and will be argued in
the fall. They have drawn the attention of liberal civil rights
groups, conservative opponents of ``preferences,'' hundreds of
colleges and universities, and the Clinton administration, which
has filed a court brief defending Michigan's admissions policies.
</P>
<P>
   The three white plaintiffs are being represented by the Center
for Individual Rights, a Washington-based law firm that
successfully overturned the admissions policy at the University of
Texas Law School that an appellate court said granted illegal
advantages to black and Hispanic applicants.
</P>
<P>
   In basing so much of its case on the benefits of diversity,
Michigan is relying on the arguments of a 21-year-old Supreme Court
opinion that became the legal basis for affirmative action programs
in colleges but has come under increasing challenge since.

WRITINGS PROMPTED WARNINGS FROM LITTLETON TEACHER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Mich.)   (jw) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Columbine High School officials said Monday that the
English teacher of Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris had warned their
parents one month before the shootings about the violent nature of
their sons' writings.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan Klebold's school compositions, which included descriptions
of a killing, were brought to the attention of his mother, Susan
Klebold, and of his school guidance counselor, said Marilyn
Saltzman, a spokeswoman for the Jefferson County Public Schools.
The high school senior dismissed the writing as ``just a story'' in
conversations with his counselor, whom Ms. Saltzman declined to
identify.
</P>
<P>
   An essay in which Eric Harris portrayed himself as a shotgun
shell prompted the same teacher to have a similar talk with his
father, Wayne Harris. Once the teacher learned that Harris was a
retired Air Force officer and that his son hoped to enlist in the
military, she concluded that the essay was consistent with his
future career aspirations, Ms. Saltzman said.
</P>
<P>
   A student in the class, Kevin Hofstra, recalled recently that
Eric Harris wrote about ``some strange stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One assignment was to write about an inanimate object,''
Hofstra said. ``Most people would choose a bicycle or something. He
chooses a shotgun shell and writes about his relationship with the
barrel. He often wrote about shotguns.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest video to come from the school also had elements of
foreboding. The syndicated program ``Inside Edition'' broadcast a
two-year-old video, intended to be humorous, that shows students
wearing black trench coats and carrying guns as they move through
the school's hallways. As four students walk away from Columbine,
the school explodes in orange flashes.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold did not appear in the film, which
was partly edited by Brooks Brown, a classmate who knew the pair
well. In a coincidence, another editor of the film, a 1997
Columbine graduate, is the son of Dwayne Fuselier, the lead FBI
investigator in the killings. An FBI spokesman has said that the
agency has full confidence in Fuselier, a 51-year-old psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   School officials have declined to allow interviews with the
teen-agers' English teacher or with their film teacher.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the shootings, the family of Isaiah Shoels, the
only black victim in the killings at the high school in Littleton,
Colo., has hired Geoffrey Fieger, the Michigan lawyer who won the
Jenny Jones talk show case last Friday and who was until last fall
Dr. Jack Kevorkian's lawyer. Fieger has said he may sue Jefferson
County Public Schools for negligence. Michael Shoels, Isaiah's
father, has accused a Columbine dean of ignoring a complaint he
made in early April that his son had received racist death threats
from the trench coat mafia, a school clique that included Eric
Harris and Dylan Klebold and that was noted for long black trench
coats.
</P>
<P>
   Almost three weeks since the killings in Littleton, about 80
investigators are working on the case, evaluating about 10,000
pieces of evidence, 1,800 tips and 1,300 interviews.
</P>
<P>
   In the only arrest so far, Mark Manes, a 22-year-old neighbor of
the gunmen was formally charged Monday with providing a minor with
the handgun used in the shootings. According to the police, Manes
supplied one of the boys on Jan. 23 with a Tec-DC9 assault pistol.
</P>
<P>
   Searching for clues and confederates of the two gunmen,
investigators have also submitted a friend of the pair to a lie
detector test and have scoured the park areas of Eric Harris'
neighborhood for the remains of old pipe bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks Brown, a neighbor of the Harrises, has said that the pair
used to set off bombs in the neighborhood. Employees at a Blackjack
Pizza delivery outlet, where the young gunmen worked, have said
that on one occasion in the past year Eric Harris displayed a pipe
bomb to co-workers at the store. He was on juvenile probation at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   New evidence has emerged that, in the minutes before their
attack on Columbine, the gunmen used timers to set off two
diversionary bombs, one four miles away, the other two miles away.
The goal apparently was to confuse and delay police and fire
workers responding to emergency calls from the high school.
</P>
<P>
   Each bomb, disguised in a backpack, was based on two 16-ounce
camp-stove-size propane tanks. Passers-by have said that one of the
bombs sent up two successive fireballs, each 40 feet high and seven
feet in diameter. The gunmen had less luck with a 25-pound propane
bomb in the school kitchen. Judging by a pattern of bullet holes in
the kitchen wall and from a security videotape recovered from the
cafeteria, investigators believe that, when this bomb failed to
detonate, the frustrated attackers repeatedly shot at the propane
tank.
</P>
<P>
   Still shocked by the attack, Columbine students and their
families received several morale boosters in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, in an event closed to the news media and
billed ``Columbine Surprise Party,'' players from two of Denver's
professional teams, the Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos and the
Colorado Rockies baseball team, mingled with 1,500 Columbine
students and family members at a nearby high school, signing
autographs and eating pizza.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Shania Twain, a country singer who was in Denver for
a concert, visited the five Columbine students who remained
hospitalized. On May 20, the one-month anniversary of the killings,
President Clinton is scheduled to visit, the White House announced
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, dozens of volunteers started dismantling a shrine
covering the size of a football field in a park adjoining Columbine
High School. On Sunday, for the second time, votive candles sparked
a fire, which consumed a canopy tent, floral bouquets, scraps of
poetry and stuffed teddy bears.

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO's air commanders plan to open two new
fronts in the bombing campaign against Yugoslavia, launching
strikes from Turkey and Hungary in an effort to surround Yugoslavia
militarily and further isolate it politically, according to allied
officials.
</P>
<P>
   So far, NATO's attacks have been launched from bases in Western
Europe, the United States and from aircraft carriers in the
Adriatic. But now air war commanders plan to attack from the east,
using air bases in western Turkey, and at the same time station
warplanes in Hungary that would strike Yugoslavia from the north.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to increase the political pressure on the Yugoslav
president, Slobodan Milosevic, and help NATO warplanes counter
Serbia's battered, but still resilient, air defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to make Yugoslavia a picture of isolation,'' said
a senior allied officer. ``The optics of the map will show that he
is surrounded, and the air defense systems he has left will be
spread very thin.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said, for example, that Yugoslavia had about 40
SA-6 and SA-3 surface-to-air missile batteries before the war and
that fewer than half were still operational.
</P>
<P>
   The SA-6, which is highly mobile, is the more capable of the
systems. And the Serbs have been moving the SA-6 batteries to both
conceal them and position them along the allies' expected attack
routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be more difficult for them if we attack along multiple
axes,'' said Brig Gen. Jean-Patrick Gaviard, a senior French
officer at NATO's air command center at Vincenza, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the SA-6s are in the south, we can come from the north,
Gaviard said. ``If they are in the center, we can come from the
south. If they only have about 10 SA-6s it will be more difficult
for them if we come from each side.''
</P>
<P>
   Opening up a new front in the air war will also help the
alliance cope with air traffic congestion over Yugoslavia. NATO
planners have done extensive planning to minimize the risk of a
collision by allied warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   And it gives NATO new bases for the hundreds of additional
planes the NATO commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, has requested.
</P>
<P>
   Though arrangements are still being completed, the basic
elements of the plan are clear. NATO plans to deploy U.S. F-15E
planes and F-16CJ fighters at air bases in western Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The role of the F-15Es is to bomb ground targets. F-16CJs
equipped with HARM anti-radiation missiles are used to strike enemy
air defenses. Turkey, which has actively supported the air campaign
against Yugoslavia, is expected to formally approve the
arrangement, NATO officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary has agreed to a similar deployment of U.S. warplanes. It
is allowing 24 FA-18 attack planes and three A-10s to be stationed
on its territory for use against targets in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   American KC-135 refueling tankers are already based at Budapest,
and the Hungarian government has also agreed to let NATO warplanes
use its air space.
</P>
<P>
   Bases, however, are just part of the problem. To enable its
warplanes in Turkey and Hungary to reach their targets, NATO has
asked Bulgaria and Romania for permission to fly over their
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Turkey and Hungary, they are not NATO members. Both,
however, are said to have agreed. Still, considerable coordination,
including agreement on flight paths, is required.
</P>
<P>
   As a former member of the Warsaw Pact, Bulgaria also has many of
the same type of Soviet-made radars as Yugoslavia, and NATO needs
to make sure that the Bulgarian radars are not attacked by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There have already been three cases in which HARM missiles have
accidentally struck Bulgaria, allied officials said.
</P>
<P>
   During the air war over Yugoslavia, NATO warplanes have fired
the HARMs, which home in on enemy radar beams, at Serbian
surface-to-air missile batteries. When the Serbs quickly turned
their radars off, the HARM missiles apparently picked up radar
emissions in Bulgaria and attacked targets there.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid a repeat of these episode, technical adjustment to the
Bulgarian radars might be made. NATO might also persuade Bulgaria
to turn off the radars while allied warplanes are flying nearby or
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   NATO air patrols would then assume the responsibility of
protecting Bulgaria against Yugoslav air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A major advantage of the new arrangement, allied officials said,
is that it will help NATO accommodate the new planes Clark has
requested.
</P>
<P>
   When Clark reviewed his options for reinforcement, allied
officials said, he had three options, code-named ``Baby Bear,''
``Mama Bear'' and ``Papa Bear.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark picked ``Papa Bear,'' the largest option. It will bring
the number of NATO planes to over 1,100 and has sparked an urgent
search for new airfields.
</P>
<P>
   Searching for places where U.S. planes might be based, the Air
Force has sent teams to about 10 countries, including Turkey,
Poland, the Czech Republic and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   The teams are considering a number of factors, including
billeting space for Air Force crews, fuel and maintenance
capabilities, ramp space for the planes and the layout of the
airfields.
</P>
<P>
   Launching attack missions from Turkey and Hungary will also help
the alliance better foil Serb efforts to anticipate the direction
of NATO's attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Serb air defenses have been degraded by weeks of attack. Even
though NATO has flown more than 4,000 bombing missions, only two of
its planes have been shot down by Yugoslav forces: a ``stealth''
F-117 and a F-16 plane.
</P>
<P>
   NATO warplanes also are no longer restricted to operating at
15,000 feet above ground. Some pilots have the flexibility to go
considerable lower, particularly to identify targets.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Yugoslav air defenses remain a worry for pilots. The
Yugoslav Air Defense Force is regarded as one of the most
professional elements of the Serbian military. Unlike the Iraqis,
for example, the Yugoslav force trained for years to counter a
large NATO air attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav military has also polished its tactics by
monitoring NATO air operations for years during the conflict in
Bosnia. And it is adept at hiding in hills and villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to honor it,'' said Maj. Mark Russell, the commander
of the detachment of ABCCC command and control planes here,
referring to the air defense threat.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav air defense capabilities were outlined recently by Gen.
Salko Begic, the Air Force chief for the Muslim-Croat federation in
Bosnia and a former classmate of the Serbian generals now
commanding Yugoslavia's air defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the Yugoslav air defense, he said, is to create a
killing zone below 10,000 feet, using anti-aircraft artillery,
SA-7s and Swedish Bofors air defense missiles, which are very
portable.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs also had SA-3 and SA-6 surface-to-air missile
batteries, which, he said, draw on a network of more than 100
radars. The network also involves observers, including Serbian
agents who monitor NATO aircraft as they take off from bases in
Europe. It is tied together by underground communications lines and
fiber-optic cable.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's goal has been to break the network into pieces so that it
cannot function as an integrated system. Without access to
information from radars throughout the country, the utility of
individual surface-to-missile batteries would be seriously
degraded.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Steve Keim, the commander of the Marine Corps
``Prowler'' EA-6B electronic warfare planes at Aviano, said NATO
was making progress in thwarting the Yugoslav air defenses, but
that it was a complex mission.
</P>
<P>
   The Prowlers' mission is to protect NATO strike aircraft by
locating and jamming Yugoslavia's early warning and targeting radar
systems or by firing HARM missiles at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one thing we can take out that will stop their
systems,'' Keim said. ``If we try to jam an emitter in the south,
there may be a northern one than can relay the information through
a communications link and land line. They are fighting on their own
turf and know where to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the air defense forces have used all of their
ingenuity to survive. The SAM batteries hide during the day. When
they attack at night, they sometimes turn their radars on for 20
seconds and then quickly shut them down to elude attack by HARM
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a long range game,'' said Lt. Col. Steven Searcy, who
commands a squadron of F-16CJ planes, which are equipped with HARM
missiles. ``We've been picking away at him and making dents in his
defenses. Now we are starting to see holes. But it will take us a
long time to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaviard, the French commander, said that the Serbs have been
moving some SA-6s near Belgrade to fill in holes in their air
defense caused by attacks on the SA-3s.
</P>
<P>
   The SA-6s, however, can be loaded on a truck in minutes and
shifted to other regions where the Serbs are expecting an attack.
Attacking from multiple directions, he said, would make the allies'
task that much easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war is very mobile and the Serbs are being clever and
flexible,'' said Gaviard. ``But if we are more flexible we will win
the war.''

ON BASEBALL: THE FIRM OF BELL, BELL &AMP; BELLE 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those fans who are waiting for Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa
to reprise their home run show, here is another race to watch while
they wait. Can Jay Bell and David Bell hit more home runs combined
than Albert Belle?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's combined,'' David Bell said when he was asked the
question, wanting to make sure the inquirer had not lost his mind.
Then he laughed. ``I have no idea,'' he said. Then he laughed some
more.
</P>
<P>
   David Bell was at Yankee Stadium this past weekend playing
second base for the Seattle Mariners. He did not add to his home
run total, leaving him with the same nine he had when he arrived.
But Jay Bell, playing against the Mets in Arizona during the
weekend, slugged his 10th and 11th home runs, giving him a share of
the major-league lead.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about combined. The Bells individually are ahead of
Belle, who had hit six for Baltimore. But the Bells, David and Jay,
need that headstart because Albert has a tendency to erupt in a
home run barrage in the latter part of the season. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the All-Star Game break last season, Belle had 18 home runs
in 86 games. After the break, he swatted 31 in 76 games for a total
of 49. Jay ended the season with 20 home runs, one short of his
career high for a season. David left New York on Sunday only one
short of his career high of 10, which he reached last season with
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   David was reluctant to talk about his seemingly new penchant for
hitting home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying really not to think about it,'' he said. ``First of
all, you can't hit them when you're thinking about them, at least I
can't. It's not my game.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay and David are not related. David is the son of Buddy Bell,
who hit as many as 20 home runs only once in his 18-year career.
Gus Bell, Buddy's father and David's grandfather, once hit 30 in a
season. Jay is the first in his family to play major-league
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Their careers, however, are related. Both played their
minor-league years in the Cleveland organization, and both
struggled in their early experience in the majors. The Indians
traded Jay to Pittsburgh in 1989 after he had batted .216 and .218
the previous two seasons. David played professionally for eight
years before spending a full season in the majors last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gained a lot of confidence over the last year,'' said
David, at 26 seven years younger than Jay. ``Before last year, I
never really got an opportunity to play any significant amount of
time. Last year was important because it allowed me to believe I
could play in the big leagues every day. And it carried over to
this season. I finally can take a deep breath and relax and go out
and play and know I'm probably going to be in there.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But if they are to outslug Belle, the Bells cannot afford to
relax too much. Marshall McDougall, on the other hand, can rest his
case for the future on only one day's worth of exploits. He is the
college player who hit six home runs _ in succession _ in a single
game Sunday. Nothing McGwire or Sosa will do this season is likely
to overshadow the Florida State player's feat at the University of
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Calling it ``pretty crazy,'' McDougall said that once he hit
three, ``we already had the game in hand so I just kept trying to
hit more and improve on my day.'' His day was a good month for most
major-league hitters.
</P>
<P>
   After producing a mere single in his first time at-bat, he
lashed a bases-empty home run in the second inning, a three-run
shot in the fourth, a bases-empty homer in the sixth, a three-run
blow in the seventh, a grand slam in the eighth and a three-run
drive in the ninth. As he trotted around the bases with No. 6,
McDougall said: ``I was just looking over at the bench. They were
going crazy. I was laughing at them because they were as excited as
I was.''
</P>
<P>
   A 6-foot-1-inch, right-handed-hitting infielder, McDougall said
he hit only nine home runs last year as a sophomore at Santa Fe
Community College in Gainesville, Fla. ``This year I worked out a
little,'' he said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   McDougall, who hit three home runs in a game against Miami
earlier in the season and has 23 for the season, said he hopes his
flurry of home runs will gain him greater recognition for the major
leagues' amateur draft next month. ``I'd love to play professional
baseball,'' he said. ``I would like to leave here this year if the
opportunity arises.''
</P>
<P>
   McDougall had the chance to turn professional two years ago. The
New York Yankees drafted him in the 37th round but did not sign
him. ``They didn't want to offer as much as I wanted, so they
didn't even come up with an offer,'' McDougall said, adding that he
wanted about $100,000 to sign. ``The scout said it would be in my
best interest to go back to school.''
</P>
<P>
   So he went back, and now he has broken the National Collegiate
Athletic Association's one-game records for home runs and runs
batted in (16).
</P>
<P>
   Jim LaFountain, who had set the RBI record with 14 for
Louisville in 1976, went on to play two years in the low minor
leagues. Henry Rochelle, whose five home runs for Campbell in 1985
had been the record, never played professionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a good sign,'' McDougall said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just as one betrothal of a television network and an Internet
company was on the verge of breaking off Monday, another engagement
was being announced.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed combination of some assets of USA Networks, the
family of cable networks, with Lycos, the Internet portal, is about
to be abandoned, said people close to the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NBC said Monday that it had agreed to merge some of
its Internet assets with Xoom, a publicly traded electronic
community that emphasizes direct marketing. The combined entity,
worth $3.9 billion based on Xoom's market value, will operate under
the name Snap.com and would be the seventh most- visited site on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The driving force behind both developments is the stock market,
which values Internet businesses far more than enterprises in any
other industry. USA ran afoul of investors because it proposed
combining Lycos, a pure Internet company, with USA's Home Shopping
Network and Ticketmaster units, along with their associated Web
sites. Never mind that the company would have had revenue of $1.5
billion _ 30 times that of Lycos alone.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos' stock fell on the news of the deal last February. And
CMGI, the largest holder of Lycos stock, said it would vote against
the acquisition. In recent weeks, executives of both Lycos and USA
concluded that it was far from certain that a majority of
shareholders would vote for the deal, people close to the deal
said. They added that since USA was not willing to raise its bid,
the two companies would agree to go their separate ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lycos and USA just couldn't sell the deal to the Street, no
matter how they repackaged it,'' said one executive with knowledge
of the transaction. The deal's imminent demise was first reported
Monday by The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's deal, meanwhile, is specifically designed to create a
company exclusively involved in the Internet. It will operate under
the name NBC Internet, or NBCi. NBC hopes that the shares of NBCi,
independent of the network's parent, General Electric Co., will
ascend to the lofty levels of other big Internet portals. If so, it
will be able to trade those shares in acquiring other Internet
companies at prices that would be unthinkable if GE actually had to
pay cash.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were as favorable to the NBC deal as they were
scornful of the USA-Lycos transaction. News of the potential demise
of the deal with USA bolstered Lycos shares by $15.75, to $105.25.
In contrast, shares of Xoom jumped by $6.75, to $81.86 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``NBC has a lot of marquee value and the power to promote
Internet properties,'' said Alan Braverman, an analyst with
Nationsbanc Montgomery securities. ``Xoom will help them capitalize
on what they have. But it's not enough.'' Braverman said that NBCi
would need to use its new public stock as currency in acquisitions
to get a bigger audience. Indeed, he said that a newly single Lycos
could make an attractive partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``NBC would have loved to do a deal with Lycos before,'' he
said. ``Maybe they can again.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rogers, the president of NBC cable, declined to say if NBC
would be interested in a deal with Lycos. But he said the company's
top goal in planning future acquisitions would be to build a
service for people with high-speed Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   NBC will contribute to NBCi its interest in Snap, the Internet
portal that it bought a portion of from CNet last year. It will
also contribute NBC.Com, the site about its television shows; NBC
Interactive Neighborhood, a site that links NBC's affiliates;
Videoseeker, a site that plays video clips over the Internet; and
10 percent of CNBC.Com, a personal finance site scheduled to begin
in June. NBC will also contribute $370 million in cash, payable
over four years, in the form of the note.
</P>
<P>
   In return, NBC will control 49.9 percent of the new company. By
keeping its ownership below 50 percent, the losses of the company
do not have to be incorporated into General Electric's income
statement. NBC has the right to convert the note into an additional
3 percent stake in NBCi, which presumably would be useful were the
company ever to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   The current holders of Xoom shares will receive a 34 percent
stake in the new company. And CNet will end up with a 13 percent
stake.
</P>
<P>
   NBC will not include the MSNBC cable and Internet news service
in the new company. MSNBC is a joint venture with Microsoft Corp.,
and its Internet site is filled with links to Microsoft's MSN
portal, a direct competitor to Snap.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The deal shows just how far Internet valuations have risen since
last June when NBC announced its investment in Snap. NBC agreed to
pay $5.9 million for 19.9 percent of Snap and has a three-year
option to buy a further 40.1 percent of the service for $32
million. On Monday, NBC executives said that Snap was valued in the
deal as equal to Xoom, which has a market value of $1.3 billion,
giving NBC a paper return of 2,000 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that return is a result of the sharp increase in
audience Snap has experienced, in part because of the promotion it
receives on NBC. In March, it was the 11th most popular site,
visited at least once by 15.8 percent of the Internet users. Xoom
was the 12th most popular site, reaching 15.7 percent of the
audience. The combination would be the seventh most-visited site,
reaching 29 percent of the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Xoom was started by Chris Kitze, a 39-year-old entrepreneur who
has started and sold four companies so far.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Xoom resembles other Internet communities like
Geocities, which agreed to be bought by Yahoo, in that it offers
free home pages, message boards, chat rooms and so on. But Xoom was
built from the ground up to be a direct marketing vehicle,
gathering data about its users' interests in order to sell them
merchandise. Xoom members are regularly barraged with e-mail
offering electronics items like scanners.
</P>
<P>
   Xoom's direct marketing focus is very much in keeping with NBC's
broader strategy. The network has been emphasizing programming in
which it can sell related merchandise, as it did selling compact
disks and videos related to its miniseries, ``The '60s.'' NBC also
invested in Value Vision, a small cable shopping channel.
</P>
<P>
   NBC said that Robert Wright, NBC's president, would be chairman
of NBCi's board. Kitze would be its president and chief executive.
Halsey Minor, CNet's chairman who has also been the acting chief
executive of Snap, would have no role in the new company.
Similarly, Laurent Massa, Xoom's president and chief executive,
will leave the company.

 Making IRA Tax Less Painful
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Arthur M. Louis &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I invested in a traditional Individual Retirement
Account through my credit union for quite a while when I was
working. Now I have retired and am about to reach age 701/2, after
which I am required to start taking distributions from the IRA. I
really would prefer to keep the money in my IRA. But because I
can't, would there be some alternate strategy that wouldn't require
me to pay taxes?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Nope.
</P>
<P>
   You will have to withdraw at least some of the money from your
IRA each year, based on the life expectancy tables provided by the
Internal Revenue Service. In your case, the minimum required
withdrawal in the first year will be about 6 percent of the IRA's
assets. And you will have to pay taxes on your withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   However, you might consider rolling over the money in your
present IRA to a Roth IRA. You still must pay taxes on the money
you roll over. But no matter what your age, you never will be
legally required to withdraw money from the Roth. And once the
money is in a Roth, your earnings will accumulate tax free, not
just tax deferred as with your present IRA.
</P>
<P>
   IRS spokesman Jesse Weller points out that if your present IRA
is large, you may not want to roll it over all at once.
</P>
<P>
   If you do, you might get pushed into a higher tax bracket for
the year in which you make the rollover. The spike in your income
also might affect your eligibility for Social Security benefits
that year and your right to claim certain tax credits. It might
even push your income to a level where you must grapple with the
outrageously complicated alternative minimum tax rules. I wouldn't
wish that on anyone.
</P>
<P>
   You probably should talk strategy with a financial planner or
tax consultant before you make your move.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds on the Net
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there an Internet site where I can enter a Series EE bond
serial number and find out the current value of the bond?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Go to the U.S. Treasury Web site at  &LR; www.publicdebt.treas.gov.
 &LR; Click on the link for ``Savings Bond Wizard.'' Then follow the
prompts to download the necessary software to your hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   You can use Savings Bond Wizard not only to determine bond
values, but also to maintain a detailed inventory of your bond
holdings _ assuming you have more than one.
</P>
<P>
   It's an attractive, easy-to-use program. I would use it myself
if only I owned a savings bond.
</P>
<P>
   Taxing Proposition
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am a former manager with United Parcel Service and hold
several hundred shares of the privately held company's stock. UPS
recently informed me that it wants to exercise its option to buy
back 10 percent of my holdings. This bothers me because my stock
represents the bulk of the money that my wife and I have saved, and
now we are faced with paying a capital gains tax on the shares that
UPS wants to buy. Is there some way to defer this tax, such as
putting the money in an IRA?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Putting the money in an IRA won't help. You still must
pay taxes on your capital gain.
</P>
<P>
   But if the company will cooperate, you can take advantage of a
legal provision that applies only to privately held stock. You can
elect to receive the money in annual installments, and pay taxes
each year only on the portion of the capital gains you receive in
that year.
</P>
<P>
   You don't cite specific figures, but let's suppose the company
wants to buy $50,000 worth of your stock and that those shares cost
you $10,000. You could take the money in five annual installments
of $10,000 each, of which $8,000 per year would be taxable.
</P>
<P>
   The installment method makes sense if it keeps you from moving
into a higher tax bracket. That's the plus side.
</P>
<P>
   The minus side is that you won't be able to reinvest the full
proceeds from the stock sale until the five-year period _ or
whatever you and the company agree upon _ has elapsed. You at least
might ask the company to keep the undistributed funds in an
interest-bearing account.

SPORTSJONES OFFERS ALTERNATIVE FROM MAINSTREAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Tim Morris, an associate professor and graduate adviser in
English at UT-Arlington, found the perfect venue for his musings
about baseball.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't in the glossy pages of some monthly sports magazine,
nor was it in the pages of a baseball periodical.
</P>
<P>
   Morris writes a column called Outside Baseball for SportsJones
(www.sportsjones.com), a collection of sports-related essays from
contributors who tackle topics usually not addressed by the
mainstream sports media.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to provide something progressive and alternative,''
said Royce Webb of Nashville, Tenn., creator of the 1-year-old
site.
</P>
<P>
   This week's edition features an article on brutality in schools
and whether ``jocks'' created the conditions for the deadly
shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. Past
editions have examined topics such as flaws in the Bowl
Championship Series and reasons why Americans can't embrace soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said his Outside Baseball commentaries are recollections
of ``sitting in the stands from a fan's perspective, of listening
to baseball on radio or TV.''
</P>
<P>
   The editorial content at SportsJones is the kind of
thought-provoking efforts one would expect if Mother Jones or
Atlantic Monthly magazines had sports sections. SportsJones is, in
fact, the only sports site listed by the Arts and Letters Daily, a
portal for online literature. Online readers will consider
SportsJones a knockoff of Salon.com.
</P>
<P>
   The site isn't strictly for sports eggheads. One of the more
interesting features is Celeb-Jock Yearbook, where users win a
T-shirt if they correctly identify a sports personality in an old
yearbook photo.
</P>
<P>
   SportsJones was launched in June by Webb and some of his
friends. Knowing that producing a print magazine would be cost
prohibitive, Webb turned to the Web, specifically a friend who
owned PCI Media, a Web-hosting company.
</P>
<P>
   While SportsJones looks at controversial topics and tries to
stray from the traditional approaches, it does not attempt shock
journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try not to be something that wants to hit you between the
eyes every week,'' said Webb, who once was a sports columnist for
the Daily Iowan. ``We just want to bring up different ways to see
sports.''
</P>
<P>
   SportsJones plans changes to its presentation beginning Monday.
The site won't get a major redesign, but instead have functions for
increased interactivity for feedback, chats, newsletters and e-mail
subscriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're standing on the steps yelling at people,''
Webb said. ``We want a little more mixing and mingling.''
 &LR; subheds:Bytes CBS expansion: CBS SportsLine has expanded its reach

A STATE DEPARTMENT REPORT DOCUMENTS KOSOVO ABUSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States has gathered evidence from
Albanian refugees of mass executions in at least 70 towns and
villages in Kosovo since large-scale deportations began in late
March, according to a report described by the State Department on
Monday as the most comprehensive documentary record to date on
atrocities there.
</P>
<P>
   The department's report said that refugee accounts suggested
that Serbian forces had executed more than 4,000 Kosovars, and that
surveillance photographs taken either by satellites or airplanes
had identified seven possible sites of mass graves.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that rapes of Albanian women were being reported
in increasing numbers, with systematic mass rapes apparently
carried out in the cities of Djakovica and Pec.
</P>
<P>
   In the western city of Pec, it said, young Albanian women were
reportedly herded into a hotel where groups of soldiers were
allowed to visit the hotel on a rotating basis to rape the women.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the conclusions of the report, titled ``Erasing History:
Ethnic Cleansing in Kosovo,'' appear to depend almost entirely on
information from refugees' accounts.
</P>
<P>
   There was no suggestion that American intelligence agencies had
been able to verify most, or even many, of the accounts by the
refugees of war crimes, and the words ``repeatedly'' and
``allegedly'' appear throughout the document.
</P>
<P>
   In releasing the report at a news conference, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said the full extent of the atrocities carried
out in Kosovo was still not known.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horrific patterns of war crimes and crimes against humanity
are emerging in Kosovo: systemic executions, organized rape and a
well-planned program of terror and expulsions,'' she said. ``Only
when fighting has ended and the people of Kosovo can safely return
home will we know the full extent of the evil that has been
unleashed in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The report offered few, if any, examples of mass killings or
other atrocities that had not already been reported by news
organizations or human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials said the report's value was instead
in its chronological, city-by-city, village-by-village account of
war crimes, a compilation that they said bolstered NATO's argument
for stepping up its air war against Yugoslavia despite the furor
created by last week's accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a huge difference between NATO, which has done
everything it can to avoid civilian casualties, and Mr. Milosevic,
whose military campaign is directed first and foremost at civilian
targets,'' Albright said. ``Ample evidence of this is provided in
the report we release today, which gathers the facts as we know
them and demonstrates the immensity of the human tragedy taking
place in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   In an extensive chronology, the report says that the Serbian
effort to depopulate Kosovo of its Albanian majority began in
earnest before NATO air strikes were launched on March 24,
undermining the Serbian argument that the bombing was what led the
Albanians to flee.
</P>
<P>
   On March 19, it notes, the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees reported that 333,000 Kosovo Albanians had been displaced
from their homes by the Serbs, with almost 28,000 already across
the border in neighboring Albania or Macedonia. By March 21, it
said, 25,000 Kosovars had been displaced in the Drenica region,
where Serbian forces were reportedly looting and burning the homes
of Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials said the refugee accounts of
atrocities by Serbs tended to support one another _ in theme and
often in graphic detail. And they said that aerial photographs left
no doubt that there were at least two mass graves in Kosovo _ in
Pusto Selo and Izbica, with five other sites in the province
considered possible mass graves _ and that more than 300 villages
had been burned, many to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides houses and apartments, mosques, churches, schools and
medical facilities have also been targeted and destroyed,'' the
report said. ``Many settlements have been totally destroyed in an
attempt to ensure that the ethnic Albanian residents do not
return.''
</P>
<P>
   The provincial capital of Pristina, it said, had been left ``a
ghost town'' after Serbian forces reportedly expelled between
100,000 and 120,000 Albanians in four days.

 Tracking Stock Can Unleash a Unit's Value
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Arthur M. Louis &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
In school you learned that the whole is equal to the sum of its
parts.
</P>
<P>
   Forget what you learned! The folks on Wall Street insist that
sometimes it can be more than that _ much more.
</P>
<P>
   That's the logic behind an ingenious financial instrument called
tracking stock, which is becoming increasingly popular in today's
highly speculative market.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking stocks are designed to unleash the market potential of
promising subsidiaries whose value might not be fully reflected in
the price of a parent company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   They work much like spin-offs, except that the assets are not
actually spun off. They are retained within the parent company.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  According to Lehman Brothers, there are more than three dozen
tracking stocks on the market. Three companies have issued tracking
stock this year, and three more have issues pending.
</P>
<P>
   Among the pending issues is the first ever for the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Quantum Corp., the Milpitas manufacturer of computer storage
devices, plans to create separate stocks for its draggy, cyclical
disk-drive business and its glamorous, fast-growing digital tape
storage business.
</P>
<P>
   Quantum's current shareholders will get one share of the storage
business and one-half share of the disk-drive business for every
Quantum share they own. After that, the shares of the two
operations will trade separately on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Clemmer, Quantum's CFO, observes that Quantum's two
basic businesses appeal to different types of investors. He says he
hopes the offering will ``give us the ability to better link up
with the objectives of investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracking stock _ so named because it tracks a subsidiary's
financial progress _ has one great advantage over spin-offs, notes
Barbara Byrne, a Lehman Brothers investment banker who has handled
several tracking-stock deals.
</P>
<P>
   She points out that because the subsidiary remains part of the
parent company, it can draw on the parent's credit standing. If
spun off and left on its own, it might not be able to borrow as
easily or cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking stock was pioneered in the 1980s by General Motors,
which created separate shares for its Electronic Data Systems and
Hughes Electronics subsidiaries, both of which were regarded as
more glamorous than the company's stodgy automotive business.
</P>
<P>
   EDS, which has since become an independent company, has
increased more than tenfold in value since it began trading in
October 1984. Hughes, first traded in November 1985, has nearly
tripled. The stock representing GM's automotive business has
slightly more than doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking stock has taken on new popularity in recent years.
Companies and their investment bankers have been alert to any
gimmick that will allow them to capitalize on the latest market
trends _ and in today's market, gimmicks rule.
</P>
<P>
   Companies with Internet or bioscience subsidiaries, for example,
are taking advantage of the stock market's frenzy for those
industries by creating tracking stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Shrewd investors might be able to take advantage of this trend
by purchasing shares in companies that fit that profile in hopes
that the companies will parcel out tracking stock to their existing
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The one hitch in that strategy _ and it is a big one _ is that
companies don't necessarily issue tracking stock to existing
shareholders. Sometimes they do _ as in the case of Quantum _ but
other times they simply sell new stock to the general public.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ziff-Davis, the New York publishing company,
recently created a separate stock to track the value of its ZDNet
subsidiary, which focuses on information for Internet users. It
kept the bulk of the stock for itself and issued the rest to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   ZDNet accounted for a piddling 5 percent of Ziff-Davis' $1.1
billion in revenues last year, so Ziff-Davis wasn't viewed on Wall
Street as a significant Internet play.
</P>
<P>
   As Tim O'Brien, chief financial officer of Ziff-Davis, puts it:
``We felt we were at a disadvantage. We wanted to create an
Internet stock with a great enough value to use in buying other
Internet stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 31, Ziff-Davis issued 71 million shares of ZDNet
tracking stock, offering 10 million shares to the public at $19 per
share.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, ZDNet stock had soared to $36, and it
closed yesterday at $31.06.
</P>
<P>
   ZDNet's total market capitalization of $2.2 billion now dwarfs
the $1.4 billion value of the remaining Ziff-Davis operations.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, this appears to be an extremely successful
issue. But it is impossible to say for certain, because we will
never know what would have happened to Ziff-Davis' stock price if
the company had stood pat and not issued tracking stock.
</P>
<P>
   ZDNet technically remains part of Ziff-Davis, and its
shareholders are entitled to vote at the Ziff-Davis annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But ZDNet's financial results now are reported separately from
those of the parent company. And if ZDNet were ever sold or
liquidated, ZDNet shareholders would receive the proceeds. (At the
moment, of course, Ziff-Davis itself is ZDNet's largest
shareholder.)
</P>
<P>
   Another company planning to issue tracking stock is Donaldson
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, the investment banker and broker. It will have
one stock tracking DLJ Direct, its online brokerage, and another
representing its traditional brokerage and investment-banking
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Internet brokers such as Charles Schwab, E-Trade and Ameritrade
have enjoyed enormous run-ups in the stock market over the past
year, and DLJ obviously wants a piece of that action.
</P>
<P>
   The DLJ issue has a couple of unusual features.
</P>
<P>
   Holders of DLJ Direct will legally be considered holders of not
just the subsidiary, but also Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. However,
holders of DLJ Direct will not have voting rights ``except in
certain limited circumstances,'' according to the company's
prospectus.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, DLJ Direct holders will be paid off in full
if the parent company sells the online brokerage's assets.
</P>
<P>
   A DLJ spokeswoman declined to discuss details of the pending
issue because ``we're in registration.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracking stock faces a potential threat from the Clinton
administration. In effect, says a U.S. Treasury official, it allows
taxpayers to spin off assets without paying tax, even in cases
where a spin-off would have been subject to tax.
</P>
<P>
   In its latest budget proposal, the administration calls for a
corporate tax on future tracking stock, levied when the stock is
issued. The amount to be taxed would be the difference between the
value of the stock at that time and the original cost of the assets
represented by the stock.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled Congress has yet to act on the
administration proposal. If it were to do exactly as the Democratic
administration wants _ never a sure bet _ ``that would be the end''
of tracking stock, says Lehman Brothers' Byrne.

 Apple Stays the Course With Software Strategy
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Jon Swartz &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Apple Computer yesterday announced the most powerful lineup of
laptop computers anywhere; a deal with Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. to
carry iMacs; and a speech-recognition program for the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   But what the computer-maker repeated from a year ago may have
been just as significant: It is sticking with its operating
software plan _ the core of its computer systems _ after years of
``strategy du jour.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope our software strategy sounds boring to you,'' Apple
interim chief executive Steve Jobs told the company's annual
Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're staying with our plan and not surprising you with the
strategy of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's ever been a better time to be a Mac
developer,'' Jobs told a standing-room-only crowd of 4,000 that
included executives and engineers from firms that make Mac
software. Mac developers attend the week's conference to hear about
Apple's road map for the future, so they can tailor software
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Flanked by imposing black-and-white murals of John Lennon and
Yoko Ono, and Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman, Jobs
introduced the PowerBook G3 portable computers, which clock in at a
fast 333 and 400 megahertz.
</P>
<P>
   The svelte models are 20 percent thinner and almost two pounds
lighter than their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   The top model, priced at $3,500, comes with a DVD player and
batteries that last up to five hours.
</P>
<P>
   The laptops weigh 5.9 pounds, compared &LR;   &LR; with 7.7 for the IBM
ThinkPad.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to reach more consumers, Apple will sell its
fruit-colored, Space Age iMacs at Sears, the largest U.S.
department store company, starting Memorial Day weekend. About 825
Sears locations also will sell add-on devices for the iMac, such as
printers and disk drives. CompUSA Inc., the largest domestic
computer retailer, is the only national chain that now offers the
iMac.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  In addition, software maker Dragon Systems of Newton, Mass.,
is creating Macintosh products based on Dragon NaturallySpeaking,
the top-selling retail speech-recognition software. It lets users
speak into a microphone attached to the computer, which converts
their words into text on screen and allows them to give voice
commands, such as ``Print file.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jobs spent the bulk of his two-hour presentation at the
conference laying out the computer-maker's operating system
software plans. The operating system essentially acts as a
computer's central nervous system. Apple's current OS can't keep up
with the industrial-strength demands of corporate users. Apple is
in the process of melding elements of the original Mac OS with
those of Rhapsody, the more advanced technology developed by Next
Software, which Apple acquired in December 1996 for $400 million.
The merged software will be called Mac OS X, which Jobs calls the
most significant upgrade to the Macintosh operating system since
the computer's introduction in 1984. Mac OS X, due in early 2000,
would allow users to run several functions at once, prevent system
shutdowns when an application fails and perform networking tasks
faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two problems with changing your mind: You never get
anything done and you frustrate developers,'' a relaxed Jobs said
later in an interview, between bites of a rice cake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple had been zigging and zagging, like so much of the
industry, and we decided to stick with a plan and implement it
well,'' he said. ``What's important is that we want Apple to be the
center of innovation and we want it to be run as efficiently as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Jobs said he was ``pleased,'' but not surprised by Apple's
remarkable turnaround from just two years ago. The Cupertino
company has logged six straight profitable quarters and is riding
the crest of strong sales of the iMac and Power Mac G3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling pretty good now,'' Jobs said. ``I don't have a
problem with (the title of interim CEO). We'll keep things moving
along.''
</P>
<P>
   He even joked that ``ER'' star Noah Wylie _ who will portray
Jobs in the cable TV movie ``Pirates of Silicon Valley'' _ could
step in as permanent CEO. ``Maybe we should hire him,'' Jobs said.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs' buoyant disposition about the company he co-founded two
decades ago was echoed by developers yesterday in the corridors of
the San Jose Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very encouraging step after years of strategy du jour
from Apple,'' said Jack Putnam, project manager at Newer Technology
in Wichita, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Charlesworth, who runs a prepress publishing company in
Sydney, Australia, said she is relieved by Apple's ``newfound focus
on consolidation and snazzy products'' after years of indecision.
</P>
<P>
   Although conferences took on a somber tone during the company's
financial struggles, this year's get-together was upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance is up 40 percent from last year, to 2,514, and about
3,100 applications have been announced for the iMac since its May
1998 introduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple's return to health is more than even I, a Mac addict,
could have dreamed,'' said John Knoll, visual effects supervisor
for ``Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace'' and a Macintosh
developer. ``I was hoping the iMacs and G3 tower machines would
help Apple limp back, but the company is charging back.''

A SWINGING SUCCESS: FROM PUNCHES TO PUTTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ A 40-foot birdie putt trickled into the hole,
triggering an upraised right fist from Esteban Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   His former calling card exposed, a fan seated behind the green
made the connection and bellowed, ``Hey, that's the boxer!''
Outwardly, Toledo smiled when he heard the response. Inside, he
winced.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the paradox with Toledo, the only participant at the GTE
Byron Nelson Classic with more career victories as a professional
boxer (12) than Top 10 finishes as a PGA Tour golfer (3).
</P>
<P>
   Part of him wants to embrace the fact he has fought his way to
the champagne-and-caviar circuit from a dirt-floor shack with no
indoor plumbing in Mexicali, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Another part wishes people would overlook his past and give him
credit for what he has become: a player who has collected more than
$500,000 at tour events in the past 17 months and could contend
this week at the Four Seasons Resort and Club.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo's latest top-10 effort, after all, came nine days ago at
the Shell Houston Open, where he finished 10th and won $53,571. If
anything, Toledo figures he's on a roll as he returns to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he expects gallery members to notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what I do, I'm still `The Boxer.' People look at me
different from the other players. Sometimes I get a little bit
tired of that,'' said Toledo, 36. ``I don't want to get attention
from that. I want to get attention because I'm playing good golf. I
want to earn it.''
</P>
<P>
   Within moments of uttering his heartfelt desire, Toledo
dismissed it as a pipe dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will ever go away,'' Toledo said of
outsiders' fascination with his humble background and his 12-1
record as a lightweight on undercard bouts in Las Vegas and Los
Angeles. ``Probably, it shouldn't. Boxing is always going to be in
my mind. There's no question I was born to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a better boxer than I am a golfer. I have that killer
instinct. I won't give up on anything. That's the mentality I've
carried from boxing into golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Toledo's strong will touches all aspects of his life,
including romance. His wife, Colleen, turned him down five times
before agreeing to their first date. Now, they have two children:
Nicholas, 9, and a newborn daughter, Eden Faline.
</P>
<P>
   Without so much as one golf lesson, Toledo has carved out a
career in a sport he treated with little more than a casual
interest until he turned 21. Using a 7-iron he retrieved from a
creek and balls he scrounged from a driving range, Toledo began
daily practice sessions on a dirt field after a botched
appendectomy (doctors had to operate twice to correct the problem)
left him vulnerable to body blows and ended his boxing career.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors, he said, considered him crazy for investing so much
time struggling to break 100 at the town's only country club. Yet
despite long hours spent cultivating ``everything except
marijuana'' on the family farm in a region marked by abject
poverty, Toledo began making incremental progress.
</P>
<P>
   By 1986, his fourth year as a golfer, he turned professional.
Toledo received his first PGA Tour card in 1994 but failed to
maintain it, earning just $66,049 and finishing 176th on the season
money list. He returned in 1998, this time to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured, Toledo's $327,244 in earnings last season seemed
like a king's ransom to someone who was teased in elementary school
because he was the only boy in the class without shoes. At the
time, Toledo was 5 and his father had just died of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   The family's youngest child made himself a promise: No matter
how hard he needed to work, he would carve out a better life for
his children. And he has. Toledo heads into the Nelson ranked 92nd
on the season money list with $187,453, and is ahead of his
career-best 1998 earnings pace.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Booker, one of Toledo's closest friends on the PGA Tour,
said the former fighter's drive separates him from most peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a big heart. That's what most people lack,'' said
Booker, who has known Toledo since both began competing in 1990 on
what is now the Nike Tour. ``In life, you can achieve anything you
want if you're willing to go through the highs and lows that it
takes to get there. That's where he stands out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Esteban has had a lot of obstacles in his path, enough to make
most people quit. But he's made it over the walls and he's still
going.''
</P>
<P>
   But he hasn't forgotten about those from similar backgrounds.
Toledo frequently volunteers to conduct clinics for inner-city
youths. During practice rounds, he'll occasionally pick someone
from the gallery to pinch hit a drive or approach shot.
</P>
<P>
   Booker said Toledo ``probably is the nicest, most approachable
guy out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo is also a contender. Just not in the sport he envisioned
when he began mapping out his athletic career.
</P>
<P>
   ``In both sports, you really have to discipline yourself,''
Toledo said. ``The way I grew up, learning to do without things, I
think that made me hungrier and more disciplined than some other
guys. I think that helped me succeed in both. I know it's made me
appreciate what I have now.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet given the choice, Toledo would trade his berth in this
week's 156-player field for a chance to fight for a boxing title.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I went back again, I'd leave golf and stick with boxing,''
Toledo said. ``In boxing, you only have to beat one other guy.
Here, it's 155.''

XIRCOM CLAIMS ONLINE DEFAMATION IN SUIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. _ Xircom Inc. has filed a lawsuit against
an Internet user who posted messages on a financial chat site that
the company considers defamatory.
</P>
<P>
   But the maker of computer peripherals for mobile computing
doesn't know the real identity of the alleged troublemaker, who
identifies himself or herself in Yahoo! message boards as ``A View
From Within'' and an engineer at the company.
</P>
<P>
   Xircom has subpoenaed Yahoo! for the identity of its accuser.
Yahoo! declined to comment on Xircom's case, but said it has the
right to comply with subpoenas or law enforcement requests as
spelled out in the online users agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit filed last week at the Ventura County Superior
Court against ``John Doe,'' Xircom is asking for at least $25,000
in damages, claiming that the Internet writer's messages have
harmed the company.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Thousand Oaks northwest of Los Angeles,
also alleges that the writer, if indeed an employee, has breached
an employment contract that calls for secrecy about Xircom's
operations, marketing plans and strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was critical of the company, attacked key management
people, made allegations regarding product defects and said the
company was withholding that information and covering it up,'' said
Randall Holliday, Xircom's general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   In messages posted on April 12 and April 22, ``A View From
Within'' said the company is hiding the problems of Xircom's
RealPort product, whose connectors are ``extremely fragile and
break very easily.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer also observed that ``management seems disconnected
from the work force,'' causing workers to be unhappy. Two sales
executives are called bozos, and the sales director is called a
joke who is ``more concerned with finding his lost hair gel than he
is about sales growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Holliday said he regularly checks Internet messages about Xircom
because the company wants to know what the public is saying. But
the attorney also makes sure that these comments don't ``cross the
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Spitzer, a law professor specializing in
telecommunications regulations at the University of Southern
California, said Internet users have to be careful when they post
messages that many people can read.
</P>
<P>
   While an e-mail written in the privacy of one's home has the
illusion of a private correspondence, it's actually a public
document when it's posted on a message board for the world to see,
Spitzer said. As such, libel and slander laws apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't post messages on the Internet unless you're comfortable
about them being published on the front pages of a newspaper,'' he
advised.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Some promoters are already treating it as the next magic potion
for fighting obesity. And though orlistat, a diet pill approved for
sale in this country two weeks ago and marketed under the brand
name Xenical, is available only by prescription, it is being made
easily available. That worries many health specialists, who say the
drug might produce bad reactions or other problems if misused.
</P>
<P>
   A company based in the British Channel Islands called Direct
Response Marketing is selling Xenical over the Internet to just
about anybody who electronically fills out a medical questionnaire
that is reviewed by a company doctor who then ``prescribes'' the
drug. ``This wonder pill promises to be one of the defining drugs
of the '90s along with Prozac and Viagra,'' the company states on
its World Wide Web site. ``Most overweight people harbor a sneaking
suspicion that somewhere there is a product that will solve all
their weight-loss problems. Well, now that product has arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators say that such marketing is legal in most
states if a doctor somewhere signs off on the prescription. They
are worried about such Internet sales pitches but are unsure
exactly what to do about them.
</P>
<P>
   A physician in Los Angeles who had nearly 900 patients on the
wildly popular mix of diet medication known as fen-phen before it
was pulled off the market in 1997 says Xenical may help bring some
of his customers back. The doctor, Ben Krentzman, who himself
weighs 400 pounds, says he believes the drug is harmless and he
sees no need to stick to the regulatory guidelines for who should
take it, though he adds that initially he will do so.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Tison, a psychiatrist in Sacramento, Calif., who devoted
his entire practice to fen-phen, buying it wholesale and dispensing
it to thousands of patients, said he had already written 60
prescriptions for Xenical and could not keep up with the demand.
``My appointment book is pretty full.''
</P>
<P>
   Such signs are pointing to an explosion in popularity like that
last seen in the fen-phen craze of the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The new drug does not work the way fen-phen did. Fen-phen was an
appetite suppressant; Xenical is the first anti-obesity medication
that blocks the body's absorption of dietary fat. And while
fenfluramine and its sister drug dexfenfluramine _ the ``fen'' in
fen-phen _ were recalled after studies showed they might cause
heart-valve defects, no evidence has emerged of dangerous side
effects associated with Xenical.
</P>
<P>
   But fen-phen and Xenical are alike in one crucial way: their
appeal as a potential quick fix for excess fat. More than half of
adult Americans are overweight, and many are desperate to shed
pounds. An estimated six million Americans took fenfluramine or
dexfenfluramine, bringing manufacturers tens of millions in profits
_ and Xenical is looking equally lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimate that the market could quickly grow to $3
billion a year, although the drug's limited effectiveness and
unpleasant side effects may make consumers move on to something
else. At least for now, however, ``this has the potential to be a
Viagra-type product in a different field,'' said Ira Loss, an
analyst with HSBC Securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as there is a lifelong search for the fountain of
youth,'' he said, ``there is a lifelong search for an easy way to
lose weight.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some health care professionals and advocates for the
obese worry that many Americans will start popping Xenical without
giving adequate consideration to the costs, benefits and side
effects. ``Misuse will happen for a couple of reasons,'' said Lynn
McAfee, a spokeswoman for the Council on Size and Weight
Discrimination. ``There is just so much money to be made out there
and so much desperation.''
</P>
<P>
   The costs come to about $4 or $5 a day, and insurers are
unlikely to pick up the tab. The benefits are limited; tests showed
patients lost 5 to 10 percent of their weight after taking Xenical
for a year in combination with a reduced-calorie diet.
</P>
<P>
   The most common side effects are bloating, flatulence and oily
stool, diarrhea and fecal incontinence, all of which the
manufacturer says can be minimized by reducing fat intake. But
Xenical also blocks absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E
and K, as well as beta-carotene, and so patients must take daily
vitamin supplements.
</P>
<P>
   The Council on Size and Weight Discrimination fears that some
users will not do that, and also worries that people with eating
disorders like bulimia, in which laxatives sometimes are used to
purge food from the system, might be attracted to Xenical.
</P>
<P>
   Health care experts fret about the potential risks of
prescribing the drug with other medications in combinations that
have neither been studied by the manufacturer nor approved by the
Food and Drug Administration. Already, Xenical is being called
xen-phen because some doctors have said they will use it with
phentermine, the still-available half of fen-phen, or with Merida,
a recently approved prescription appetite suppressant.
</P>
<P>
   Creating such drug cocktails could lead to adverse effects. ``I
don't like that, and I wouldn't do it,'' said Dr. Jules Hirsch, an
obesity expert at Rockefeller University in Manhattan who served on
the FDA advisory panel on Xenical. Hirsch said he voted against
approving the drug because of its limited effectiveness. The
public, Hirsch added, should ``remember combinations before that
have been particularly bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman-LaRoche Inc., the pill's manufacturer, says Xenical is
only meant to be used by the most seriously obese people who are
under a doctor's care. The company, based in Nutley, N.J., also
said Xenical should be used only as one component of a complete
weight-loss program. ``What we are providing now is a new tool to
be added to counseling, better nutrition and exercise that we hope
will allow people to better manage their disease for the long
run,'' said Patrick J. Zenner, president and chief executive of
Hoffman-LaRoche, a unit of Swiss-based Roche Holdings Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that many dispensers of the drug are already
treating it as a cure-all. And others say that with no known
serious side effects to the drug, there is little reason to worry.
</P>
<P>
   Take Krentzman, the 400-pound obesity expert who lost most of
his business after the fen-phen fiasco. He recently updated his Web
site to include his price for Xenical, and he says he may
eventually prescribe it to patients who do not fit the guidelines
set by the manufacturer and the FDA. Krentzman also said he was
considering prescribing Xenical in combination with other
medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``This drug works in the interior of the gut _ it never gets
into the bloodstream _ so what harm can it do to you?'' Krentzman
said. ``If it is none, what's the reason to restrict it?''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty, say health care experts, who note that the effects of
untested drug combinations are often not known until problems arise
later.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In another practice that concerns some of the health care
experts, Direct Response Marketing, which is selling the drug on
the Internet, has few safeguards to verify exactly who its
customers are. The company requires what it calls a medical
consultation, which simply amounts to answering health-related
questions by computer, agreeing to the terms of a disclaimer and
plugging in a credit card number.
</P>
<P>
   One option on the online form, which the company says is
reviewed by its doctors, even allows customers to conceal the use
of the drug from their physicians. They simply click on a box
saying ``I do not want DRM to advise my doctor, and I take full
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Direct Response Marketing, which said it had already received
thousands of orders from customers in the United States, insisted
there was nothing wrong with its marketing tactics or its
customer-screening process. It also said it had turned away some
potential customers because of their responses to its questions.
</P>
<P>
   But just how does the company insure that it is not selling to a
16-year-old or someone with an eating disorder? ``That is something
we have no control over,'' said Tom O'Brien, managing director of
the company, who also said that most teen-agers do not have credit
cards. ``If someone really wants to lie, they can get hold of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission acknowledge that
they have been caught off guard by the surge in the sale of
prescription drugs on the Internet _ and cannot even agree which
agency has jurisdiction in regulating the trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has sort of taken us to a place and at a pace
that we've got to do some rethinking about the traditional
regulatory models,'' said Rich Cleland, senior staff attorney at
the FTC. The problem is compounded when the seller, the buyer and
the doctor who reviews ``medical consultations'' are in different
states or countries.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line? ``People going on line without a prescription
are taking a gamble,'' said Jeffery Shuren, a medical officer at
the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some physicians and weight-loss companies _
including the Weight Watchers International unit of H.J. Heinz Co.
and Jennie Craig Inc. _ decline to dispense fat-fighting
medications. Even so, the new drug's profit potential is too great
for some chains to ignore altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The Diet Workshop in Boston used to prescribe fen-phen at its
clinics, but said it had discontinued the drug approach. That is
not to say its employees turn away people who want Xenical or other
diet pills. They simply send them to Philemon Marvell, a local
doctor. It so happens that Marvell is one of Diet Workshop's
owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is part of Diet Workshop, so he is going to ask those
members to continue the behavior-modification program as well,''
said Jane Shannon, a sales supervisor at the company. Marvell and
other Diet Workshop officials did not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   The Council on Size and Weight Discrimination says that
weight-loss clinics should not be associated with diet pills at all
and that doctors who aggressively seek people who want Xenical or
other drugs are exploiting the public. Unfortunately, McAfee, the
council's spokesman, said: ``Xenical is not in Fort Knox with a
fence around it. Any doctor can whip out a prescription pad, write
it and people will buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman-LaRoche, which has 2,000 sales representatives marketing
Xenical to doctors, nutritionists and weight-loss centers, said it
was not promoting the drug as a panacea. ``This is not a magic
bullet,'' Zenner said.
</P>
<P>
   On that point, the company and the Council on Size and Weight
Discrimination agree. And it is all the more reason, McAfee said,
that consumers should not rush to take Xenical.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice to consumers,'' she said, ``is if they don't have a
desperate medical need, don't buy a diet drug or a new car in the
first model year.''

A BALL STRIKES A CHEST LIGHTLY, A YOUNG LIFE IS SUDDENLY LOST 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SELDEN, N.Y. _ Eric Sopracasa, a 21-year-old University of
Massachusetts lacrosse player, was participating in a routine
practice last Wednesday, during the last week of the Minutemen's
season. During one drill, he was struck on the chest by the ball,
not an uncommon occurrence for a defensive player. The ball was not
going particularly fast and seemed more like a pass than a shot,
said some of the people at practice that day.
</P>
<P>
   But Sopracasa, a fourth-year junior from Long Island, had been
struck in exactly the wrong spot at exactly the wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   He collapsed and stopped breathing; his heart stopped beating.
After being revived briefly, he died that afternoon at Cooley
Dickinson Hospital in Northampton, Mass. An autopsy performed last
week did not list Sopracasa's cause of death, noting that it was
apparently accidental. But even though an underlying cause will not
be ruled out until the results of toxicological and other tests
come back next week, Sopracasa's family and school officials
believe he might have died from sudden cardiac arrest after a blunt
blow to the chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a freak, freak accident,'' said Frank Smith, who
was Sopracasa's closest friend and his roommate for two years.
``When I got to the hospital and they told me that Eric had died,
the doctor told me there is only a one-in-10-million chance of this
happening. So why did it happen to my best friend? It's
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Sudden cardiac arrest is a rare killer of young athletes that is
nonetheless responsible for deaths in Little League baseball,
softball, hockey, football, karate and lacrosse, according to the
National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research at the
University of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   After an emotional memorial service at St. Margaret of Scotland
Roman Catholic Church here, Sopracasa, a former all-America
lacrosse player at Sachem High School, was buried Monday near his
family's Farmingville home. The funeral was attended by his family,
more than a hundred friends and all of his teammates from UMass.
</P>
<P>
   Sopracasa's teammates voted last week not to play the season's
final game, which was scheduled for last Saturday at Brown, so that
the entire team could take a bus from Massachusetts to Long Island
to attend his wake and funeral. Many of them still struggled Monday
to fully understand just how this happened to someone who was so
young and who appeared to be so healthy.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dr. Ira S. Nash, a cardiologist at the Mount Sinai
Medical Center in New York, there exists only a fraction of a
second when a sudden blow to the chest can cause the heart to go
into ventricular dysrhythmia and eventually stop beating
altogether. This quivering of the heart is called commotio cordis.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is thought to happen is a blow to the chest, at a very
precise moment, is equivalent to giving the heart an electric
shock,'' Nash said. ``That mechanical impulse throws the heart out
of its rhythm. But the timing has to be just right for this grave
disturbance to occur. What happens next is the heart can stop
pumping blood altogether, causing the victim to collapse
immediately. It is important to point out that this is not the same
as a real trauma to the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a risk involved in all athletic activities, Nash said,
but these rare occurrences should not cause parents to keep their
children from participating in sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite uncommon,'' Nash added. ``You're probably at a
greater risk in your mom's car on the way to a game.''
</P>
<P>
   The victims are usually young people, and ones who frequently
have thin or narrow chests, said Dr. Barry Maron of the
cardiovascular research division of the Minneapolis Heart
Foundation. He has analyzed other fatal chest injuries in baseball,
soccer and lacrosse.
</P>
<P>
   Maron gave four conditions for commotio cordis to occur: a blow
over the heart, relatively light and at just the right moment in
the heartbeat cycle, and to an individual with a thin or narrow
chest.
</P>
<P>
   Sopracasa fit into that category. He was listed at 5 feet 8
inches and 170 pounds, probably generous numbers according to
several of his teammates. But it was his rather small size that
endeared him to those who played with him. He was considered too
small by many college recruiters, but he made up for his lack of
physical bulk with an uncommon fire and dogged determination.
</P>
<P>
   An expert in fatal chest blows, Maron and his colleagues studied
25 athletes, ranging in age from 3 to 19, killed by a blunt blow to
the chest. They published their findings in the New England Journal
of Medicine in August 1995. Sixteen deaths resulted from baseballs
hitting the chest, one from a lacrosse ball, four by hockey pucks,
one by a karate kick, one by a football helmet and the other two by
softballs. Before learning of Sopracasa's death, Dr. Frederick
Mueller of the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury
Research had never heard of a college athlete dying after a blow to
the chest.
</P>
<P>
   A lacrosse ball, which is made of hard rubber and weighs five
ounces, can reach speeds of 80 miles an hour when it is shot.
</P>
<P>
   Of chest padding and whether it could prevent commotio cordis,
Maron said: ``Common sense would say that additional padding over
the heart may do some good. But that needs to be proved through
research. And that hasn't been done as this is all relatively
new.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam Waxer, who was Sopracasa's defensive partner two years ago,
said: ``This whole thing is hard for me to understand. I've been
hit in the same spot at least a hundred times. We're defensemen, so
we always get hit by the ball. It kind of goes with the territory.
But why did Eric die? I just don't get it.''

IN WATER, AQUAFINE'S A BIG FISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON TAKENOUCHI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARITA, Calif. _ It started with chickens.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years ago, Aquafine Corp. got its start in a tiny downtown
Los Angeles office designing air purification systems for
industrial chicken farms.
</P>
<P>
   When antibiotics became a common ingredient in chicken feed,
company founder Louis Veloz changed the company's focus to water
purification through the use of ultraviolet light.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be a good move.
</P>
<P>
   Sustained by strong demand and product diversification, the
multimillion-dollar company based in Valencia in northern Los
Angeles County will throw its 50th anniversary party this Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Chief executive Roberta Veloz said the company's success and
longevity have not come as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought it was going to be successful,'' she said.
``It has a lot of potential just because of the environmental
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Veloz, the daughter-in-law of Aquafine's founder, began working
at the company in 1980 and purchased it outright in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in part to her heavy investment in infrastructure,
Aquafine now has a &UR;  &LR; strong presence in the water purification
industry. Its products supply clean water for drinking and
semiconductor production, and its major customers include the
Coca-Cola Co., Anheuser-Busch Cos., Bristol-Myers Squibb and
Motorola Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has a growing international role. It opened an
office in the Netherlands last year, and officials say 35 percent
of company sales are now overseas.
</P>
<P>
   President Michael Murphy said revenues have grown almost 200
percent since 1994, bringing the private company into the ``$15
million to $25 million'' range.
</P>
<P>
   And there's more to come, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to be a $50 million company in the next five
years,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's signature technology _ the use of ultraviolet
light to neutralize microorganisms and reduce organics _ has driven
much of Aquafine's growth.
</P>
<P>
   UV systems have become a standard part of semiconductor
production, a booming industry in which even trace contaminants in
a water supply can hurt the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Aquafine equipment is also used for beverage and pharmaceutical
production, shrimp farms, aquariums and building cooling systems.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said future growth will be fueled by innovation,
including developing chlorine-reduction technology and the
introduction of ``turn-key'' systems that integrate several
Aquafine systems into one compact unit.
</P>
<P>
   Veloz said the growing popularity of nonchemical water treatment
methods will also boost demand for UV systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the alternative to chemical disinfection,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But rapid growth has presented one major problem: how to fit
more work space into already-cramped facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The company owns one building and leases three others in the
Valencia Industrial Center. But President Murphy estimated the
company's current space _ about 40,000 square feet total _ is about
half what it needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's equipment that we frankly don't have room to put in
right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Long-time employee Wayne Schulze said he welcomes the change
from a smaller, family company to an international corporation. Now
a sales administrator with international responsibilities, Schulze
said he began working at the company in 1985 as an assembler making
$5 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things had stayed the same,'' said Schulze, who now makes
far more and is earning a bachelor's degree with the company's
financial assistance, ``I wouldn't be where I am today.''

CHINESE MOURN EMBASSY VICTIMS, AND ASK QUESTIONS

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ They had laid her out in her best clothes
and wound a long silk chiffon scarf around her neck and draped it
down the length of her body. But the fine clothes could not hide
the stitches that closed an ugly gash on the forehead, nor the
black bruising that the bomb blast had inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu Ying, just short of her 28th birthday, died on Friday in the
NATO bombing attack on the Chinese embassy here. She had been
asleep in bed with her husband, Xu Xinghu, 31, upstairs in the
building when the bombs hit close to midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Monday they were in their coffins beside each other in a small
chapel at the New Cemetery. Xu was in a gray suit, white shirt and
tie, his face bruised and his spiky black hair standing on end. In
the quiet calm of the chapel, the violence of their deaths was
shockingly apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Beside them lay Shao Yunhuan, dressed in a pale turquoise
trouser suit, her face and hands blackened and bruised and her
frail body lying unevenly, her limbs wrenched in an unnatural
position.
</P>
<P>
   Xu was the Belgrade correspondent for The Guangming Daily, where
Ms. Zhu had also worked, in the advertising department. Ms. Shao
worked for the official New China news agency.
</P>
<P>
   The explosions that killed them came with such force that they
shook buildings miles away. The bombs, which NATO said it had fired
at the wrong target, landed in the sleeping quarters of the
embassy. They set fire to the building and demolished whole floors.
</P>
<P>
   One official survived by chance. ``Just two meters away from me,
the whole floor opened up,'' the official said. ``Those poor people
who were killed were sleeping.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 100 Chinese mourners _ family members, journalists and
embassy workers _ gathered for a short ceremony here at noon
Monday, before the bodies were cremated.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zhu's father, Zhu Fulai, a specialist on Japan, stood at the
head of his daughter's coffin, bowing to each group of mourners as
they filed past. He was alone, he said in an interview, because his
wife had collapsed when she heard of their daughter's death and was
hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   No relatives stood at Ms. Shao's coffin. Her husband, an embassy
employee, was in the intensive care unit in Central Hospital,
unaware of his wife's death. He was blinded in the bombing and is
to be flown to Beijing for an operation as soon as his condition is
stable, colleagues said. Friends who have visited him said that he
was conscious but that no one had told him the news because of his
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Four other victims remain in the intensive care unit, including
the military attache, Ren Baokai, who was pulled from the wreckage
eight hours after the strike.
</P>
<P>
   Mourners, dressed in black, wore white paper carnations in their
buttonholes at the ceremony. As they passed, they smoothed the long
white ribbons of paper, crossed with Chinese calligraphy, that
decorated the wreaths of flowers. They bowed from the waist at each
coffin, many with tears streaming down their faces.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian and Chinese officials attended the ceremony and were
quick to push their political message after the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a serious violation of international charters and the
sovereignty of China,'' said Sun Yuxi, a spokesman for the Foreign
Ministry who arrived from Beijing after the bombing. ``NATO should
take full responsibility for this act that caused three deaths and
wounded 20.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun said the bombing had been deliberate because three missiles
had struck the building. ``I visited the site yesterday,'' he said,
``and from the bombing I think the embassy was clearly targeted.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the three dead, he said, ``We are taking them home as
heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president of the Serbian government, Milovan Bojic,
criticized NATO, saying: ``They are not choosing their targets.
Their main aim is to destroy our people.''
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade Mayor Vojslav Mihailovic said, ``I appeal to all people
who create and can influence policy making in the world to prevent
further killings.''
</P>
<P>
   One diplomat said NATO made the embassy a target on purpose, not
least because such a mistake could have been so easily avoided.
``The American military attache was often coming to the embassy,''
the diplomat said. ``They were surely some CIA people in the
embassy here, and they had to have had the correct information.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The deputy editor in chief of The Guangming Daily, Chai
Huisheng, remembered Xu as one the paper's best correspondents.
``He was an ordinary guy,'' the editor said. ``Open, jokey. But he
really worked. Since the air strikes began, he wrote every day, and
there was huge interest in his articles.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zhu, had been popular at the paper, he said, adding, ``She
was always a joyful, happy person.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Zhu said he had not seen his daughter since the summer of 1997,
because his work had taken him to Japan and she had come to
Belgrade. Looking stern and troubled behind thick glasses, he sat
on a hotel sofa afterward and wondered aloud about the tragedy. He
said he had not followed the reactions that his daughter's death
had stirred. But he did wonder what NATO commanders and President
Clinton were thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that Clinton always calls for human rights, and I agree
with him,'' Zhu said. ``But why does he not care for the rights of
my daughter? I want the president to understand that people, both
American and Chinese, all just want to live peacefully and
quietly.''

AMY FISHER IS FREED AFTER 6 YEARS IN PRISON
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif.)   (jw) 
 By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ Amy Fisher was released from state prison
Monday morning, ending nearly seven years behind bars for the
shooting of Mary Jo Buttafuoco.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fisher flew to Long Island with her mother, who had fought
long for her release, and went into seclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing dark glasses to shield her eyes from the bright morning
sun and the television news cameras, Ms. Fisher, who is 24, emerged
from the State Correctional Facility at Albion shortly before 9
a.m. and embraced her mother, Rose Fisher, who led her to a waiting
car. They were taken to a nearby airport, where they boarded a
privately chartered plane for the return home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amy is thrilled and very happy to be back with her mom,'' said
Ms. Fisher's lawyer, Bruce Barket, who helped usher her through the
crowd of waiting reporters and into the car. ``All she wants is to
spend the next few days with her mom and start getting used to life
outside a prison.''
</P>
<P>
   The final clearance for Ms. Fisher's release came last week when
the New York State Parole Board voted 2-1 to grant her parole. The
board acted several days after Judge Ira Wexner of Nassau County
Court reduced Ms. Fisher's sentence from a maximum of 15 years to a
maximum of 10 years, making her immediately eligible for parole.
Wexner acted after finding that Ms. Fisher was not appropriately
represented in 1992 by her first lawyer, Eric Naiburg.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Buttafuoco made an emotional appearance at the resentencing
hearing, telling Wexner that she had forgiven Ms. Fisher and asking
him to press for Ms. Fisher's release from jail. Ms. Fisher
tearfully told Mrs. Buttafuoco she was sorry for shooting her and
said she accepted total responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fisher was 16 and a senior at John F. Kennedy High School in
Merrick when she began an affair with Mrs. Buttafuoco's husband,
Joey, an auto-body repairman. She was 17 when she went to the
Buttafuoco home in Massapequa on May 19, 1992, rang the bell, and
shot Mrs. Buttafuoco in the face when she answered the door. The
.25 caliber bullet is still lodged in Mrs. Buttafuoco's neck.
</P>
<P>
   Joey and Mary Jo Buttafuoco now live in a suburb of Los Angeles,
where he has been the host of a radio talk show. They moved from
Long Island after Buttafuoco served six months in the Nassau County
jail after pleading guilty to having sex with Ms. Fisher when she
was a minor.

MICROSOFT IS ACQUIRING 4 PERCENT STAKE IN NEXTEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Demonstrating that its ambitions are not tethered to the wired
world, Microsoft Corp. said Monday that it had agreed to pay $600
million in cash for about 4 percent of Nextel Communications Inc.,
a big national provider of wireless communications.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's deal appeared to be Microsoft's biggest move yet into
the fast-growing wireless communications market. As part of the
deal, Microsoft, the No. 1 personal computer software company, will
help Nextel deliver data services, including electronic mail and
date books to wireless phones.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Nextel will use software developed by Microsoft as a
framework for delivering an even broader range of Internet-based
services to its wireless users.
</P>
<P>
   Coming less than a week after Microsoft announced a $5 billion
pact with AT&AMP;T Corp. to use Microsoft software in some of AT&AMP;T's
cable television systems, Monday's deal highlighted Microsoft's
hunger to expand beyond the PC industry. Even as AT&AMP;T moves to use
cable systems to deliver integrated packages of voice, video and
data communications, new technologies are facilitating the delivery
of services more advanced than phone calls and without wires.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft wants to move its Windows operating system into both
environments and into others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft and Nextel will deliver the next generation of
wireless services to enable people everywhere to stay in touch with
the information they need, regardless of location,'' Bill Gates,
Microsoft's chairman, said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Ozburn, general manager of Nextel's online unit, said in an
interview, ``Whereas yesterday, if you walked away from your PC,
you would have no ability to touch the power of the Internet. When
we launch Nextel Online, wherever you are, you will be able to
access those Internet tools.''
</P>
<P>
   Nextel's network, which uses wireless frequencies that were once
used largely for dispatching trucks, covers about 70 percent of the
U.S. population. But Nextel plans to offer the service in only six,
undisclosed markets this year. Using phones made by Motorola Inc.,
one of Nextel's primary backers, the company plans to offer the new
services throughout its system next year.
</P>
<P>
   For Nextel, Monday's deal came less than a week after it emerged
from abortive negotiations to be acquired by MCI Worldcom Inc., the
No. 2 long-distance carrier, which does not have a significant
wireless operation.
</P>
<P>
   Those two companies walked away from weeks of negotiations after
MCI Worldcom refused to pay Nextel what it wanted. Nextel's
discussions with Microsoft, however, had been developing for at
least that long. Some executives in the wireless phone business and
on Wall Street speculated Monday that Nextel's growing confidence
that it would get a cash infusion from Microsoft stiffened the
company's backbone in its talks with MCI Worldcom.
</P>
<P>
   Nextel is growing fast, but is not generating free cash flow
because it must record large interest charges on its almost $10
billion in debt and because it is spending about $1.9 billion a
year to expand its network.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to refinance some of its own debt and perhaps to improve
its cash position, Nextel is planning a new $1.2 billion bond
offering, according to some executives on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Nextel declined to comment on its financing plans.
</P>
<P>
   The convergence of the telecommunications and computing worlds
took yet another step Monday as Lucent Technologies Inc., North
America's biggest maker of telephone equipment, announced that it
had developed a new technology that could reduce from five to one
the number of microchips needed in a phone that uses Internet
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Lucent technology could make Internet phones cheaper and
easier to manufacture.

GORE ADDS FORMER WHIP TO HIS CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.J., N.Y.)  (jw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore, seeking to add political
firepower to his campaign for the Democratic presidential
nomination, has enlisted former Rep. Tony Coelho of California as a
top strategist, several Gore advisers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The advisers said Gore was turning to Coelho, a former House
majority whip who became an investment banker in New York, out of a
sense that his campaign was lacking direction and had been
diminished by favorable publicity about his rival, former Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Coelho have had a series of meetings to discuss his
role, and met here as recently as this weekend, Gore advisers said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Gore's advisers said that they were not certain of
Coelho's title, that it might not have been worked out, but that he
would play a central strategic role in the campaign. It was not
clear how that would affect Gore's campaign manager, Craig Smith, a
former White House political director.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, Gore's spokesman, would not confirm Coelho's role
with the campaign. Lehane said only, ``I can't comment at this time
beyond the fact that they're obviously friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Coelho did not return calls to his Washington office on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He and Gore first knew each other when they served together in
the House. More recently, the vice president and Coelho have worked
together on issues for the disabled. Coelho had epilepsy and has
long been a spokesman for people dealing with epilepsy.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Coelho was a rising star in the Democratic Party
and was known as one of the party's most prodigious fund-raisers.
But he abruptly resigned his House seat in 1989 after accusations
of financial impropriety in his personal investments. No charges
were ever brought against him.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho re-emerged in the political spotlight in the summer of
1994, when President Clinton brought him to the Democratic National
Committee as a senior strategist dispatched to help save the
party's sagging fortunes in the elections that November.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two months before the election, Coelho told USA Today
that 1994 would be ``a normal, off-year election'' and not as
devastating as many Democrats feared. It was devastating, with
Republicans re-taking the House for the first time in half a
century. Once again, he returned to investment banking.
</P>
<P>
   One Gore adviser recalled Coelho's role in 1994 and questioned
what he could do for the vice president. ``He's an extremely smart,
capable guy,'' the adviser said. ``But the last time he was brought
in to whip something into shape he didn't last very long. I'm not
sure he knows how to wield that whip.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers insisted that they were not worried about
accusations surrounding Coelho's resignation from the House after
nearly a decade, even though Gore himself had been buffeted by
questions about his fund-raising in the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   One Democratic strategist who supports Gore said Coelho was ``a
piker by today's standards'' in terms of the accusations that
swirled around him. The strategist added, ``And that was years and
years and years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps another sign of Gore's potential weakness, the
Republican National Committee said Monday that it had told its
research department to devote half its time to scrutinizing
Bradley's record.
</P>
<P>
   David Israelite, the party's director of political and
governmental affairs, noted in a memorandum to the Republican
national chairman, Jim Nicholson, that Gore's poll ratings had
slumped and that Bradley's were improving.
</P>

   ``Based on this most recent confirmation of what our earlier
research has indicated, I have directed our research department to
shift its focus to Bill Bradley a full 50 percent of the time,''
Israelite wrote. ``We will continue to monitor the situation.''

   Clifford May, a Republican Party spokesman, said, ``We think
that at this point there are two candidates for the Democratic
nomination and the voting public deserves to know as much as
possible about both of them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lehane, Gore's spokesman, attacked the memorandum as a ploy
to make Gore appear vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their strategy is pretty obvious,'' he said. ``If they pretend
like they're attacking our opponents, by implication it's intended
to show that we have been weakened by their attacks on us.''

   CRUISING TO CHARLESTON
</P>
<P>
   Q. I would like to take my mother, who is 80, on a tour of
plantations in the South, by bus or barge. She has mentioned
visiting Charleston and thereabouts. Any suggestions? _ Kathleen
Sullivan, Manhasset, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. A number of companies, like the Delta Queen Steamboat Co.,
(800) 215-0805, and Riverbarge Excursions, (888) 456-2206, offer
plantation cruises on the Mississippi River. There is no such great
river meandering through the Southeast, of course, but there is the
Intracoastal Waterway.
</P>
<P>
   The Nantucket Clipper is a 100-passenger ship that makes several
seven-night tours of the antebellum South i March, April and
November, between Jacksonville, Fla., and Charleston, S.C., calling
at Savannah, Ga., among other places. On Oct. 19, the vessel is
also scheduled to depart on an 11-night Colonial America and Civil
War cruise from Washington to Jacksonville, also calling at
Charleston and Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   There is time for touring on your own at the ports of call, or
optional excursions can be booked at extra cost, according to
Elizabeth McQuinn, a spokeswoman for Clipper Lines.
</P>
<P>
   At Charleston, for example, a three-and-a-half-hour outing to
Middleton Place, an 18th-century plantation with landscaped gardens
on the Ashley River, costs $46. A three-hour Historic Charleston
tour, including the 1803 Joseph Manigault House, costs $33. Similar
tours are offered in Beaufort, S.C., Savannah and other ports.
</P>
<P>
   The prices for the antebellum cruise are $1,950 to $3,490 a
person; the Civil War cruise costs $2,900 to $5,000. For more
information, contact Clipper Lines, 7711 Bonhomme Ave., St. Louis,
MO 63105; (800) 325-0100, fax (314) 727-6576;
www.clippercruise.com. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you go to Charleston directly, Charleston Tours offers
several tours of the area, using 15- and 25-passenger buses. These
range from a 90-minute city tour for $15 to an ``all-day
adventure'' combining the city tour and a trip to Boone Hall, a
plantation with gardens, slave cabins and an Avenue of the Oaks,
for $45. Jane Kiser, the owner, said she also arranges custom
tours.
</P>
<P>
   Contact Charleston Tours at 545 Savannah Highway, Charleston, SC
29407; (843) 571-0049, fax (843) 571-6248;
www.charleston.net/com/charlestontours/tours.htm.
</P>
<P>
   There are no true preserved plantations around Savannah, but
there are plenty of historic sites. The Savannah Convention and
Visitors Bureau, (877) 728-2662, and its Web site, www.savcvb.com,
can lead you to about three dozen tour operators.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is the River Street Riverboat Co., (800) 786-6404,
which uses two paddlewheelers for 60- and 90-minute narrated tours,
some with meals and entertainment (including gospel music), for
$13.95 and up. It offers occasional special tours in conjunction
with the Georgia Historical Society, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   By land, Gray Line Historic Landmark Tours, (912) 234-8687,
offers daily bus tours to museum and private homes in the city and
low country for $16 and up. Arrangements can be made for a private
guide and a car, as well, said Betsy Clapcott, director of sales
and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL TO EUROPE BY SHIP
</P>
<P>
   Q. I would like to explore France and the British Isles on foot.
Since I've grown wary of air travel, can I take a ship across the
Atlantic from Montreal or Boston? _ Hillary Smith, Peacham, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   A. Most trans-Atlantic crossings these days are out of Florida
or New York, the latter mainly on the Queen Elizabeth II. I could
find only one ocean liner calling at Boston from Europe. But you
can leave nearly any week from Montreal on one of two
passenger-carrying freighters operated by Canada Maritime,
according to Kerry Touloumis of Travltips, freighter cruise
specialists in Flushing, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The ships, the Canmar Pride and the Canmar Honour, are
40,881-ton vessels built last year. Each has double and single
cabins, which are carpeted and air-conditioned, and have a
refrigerator and a sitting area, as well as private bath with
shower. Each also has a passenger lounge with television and VCR.
Passengers dine with the officers on Western and Indian cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   The ships leave Montreal on Sunday and are due in Thamesport,
Kent, England, a week later. On the return trips, they leave
England on Monday and stop in Antwerp, Belgium, and Le Havre,
France, before returning to Montreal. The cost is $1,740 one way,
$3,165 round trip.
</P>
<P>
   Contact Travltips at P.O. Box 580188, Flushing, NY 11358; (800)
872-8584; www.travltips.com.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd like to return in luxury and the timing is right, the
Seabourn Pride, a Cunard line ship, leaves London on Sept. 5 for a
14-day cruise to Scotland, Iceland and Newfoundland, arriving in
Boston on Sept. 19. The cost is from $11,550 a person, double
occupancy. Information and reservations: (800) 528-6273;

<P>
   SUMMER SKIING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. For my husband's 50th birthday, we would like to plan a ski
trip for July. Are there choices for summer skiing other than
Portillo, Chile? _ Susan Zimmer, New York, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. Portillo, where the U.S. ski team has trained, is but one of
more than a dozen ski resorts in Chile, including several _ La
Parva, El Colorado and Valle Nevado _ close to Santiago. And across
the border in Argentina are another dozen. The main centers for
skiing in Argentina are around Mendoza in the northwest (including
Valle de Las Lenas) and around Bariloche, farther south, in the
Lakes District.
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative is to head for the South Pacific, New
Zealand specifically. There are a number of ski areas, but the most
popular, according to Anna Synnott of the New Zealand Tourism
Board, are those on the South island, near Queenstown. These
include The Remarkables and Coronet Peak.
</P>
<P>
   Holidaze Ski Tours, 810 Belmar Plaza, Belmar, N.J. 07719, (800)
526-2827, www.holidaze.com, offers Southern Hemisphere ski trips.
Bob McErlean, the owner, said his most popular trip to New Zealand
was five nights in Queenstown. Including air fare from Los Angeles,
a Milford Sound cruise and transfers, it is $1,325 each, double
occupancy. Four days of lift tickets is $87 more.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also books summer ski trips to Chile and Argentina.
In Chile, seven nights at Valle Nevado, including air fare from
Miami, breakfast and dinner daily and lift tickets, start at
$1,716, a person double occupancy. Holidaze has similar trips to
Bariloche or Las Lenas in Argentina, with prices from $1,716.

 ANN ARBOR, Mich.: challenge since.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Supreme Court case was California Regents vs. Bakke, in
which Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. sided with one bloc of four
justices in concluding that a state medical school program that set
aside a number of places for minority applicants was unlawful.
</P>
<P>
   In so deciding, Powell disagreed with the other four-member
bloc, which said admissions officers could give preferences based
on race in order to make up for societal discrimination. But in a
separate opinion, he offered his own rationale for affirmative
action, arguing that to promote the ``robust exchange of ideas''
that might flow from the diversity of a student body, institutions
of higher learning could give some consideration to an applicant's
race.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New
Orleans rejected Powell's opinion in striking down the affirmative
action program at the University of Texas Law School. While that
ruling applied only to the 5th Circuit, critics of the Powell
opinion say it should no longer be considered paramount anywhere.
Noting that it had not been joined by other justices, lawyers for
the Michigan plaintiffs argued in court papers, ``There is no basis
for concluding that Justice Powell's `diversity' rationale
represents the `holding' of the Court.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs also contend that even if the Bakke opinion is
still law, Michigan violates its spirit by making race the decisive
factor.
</P>
<P>
   In assessing applicants, Michigan's admissions officers assign
points to various academic criteria, among them grade point
average, results on standardized tests like the SAT and the
relative difficulty of the applicant's high school courses. They
also give points for a number of other factors: whether a student
is black or Hispanic, for instance, or is from a low-income family,
or comes from a county in the state that historically sends few
students to the university. (Those counties tend to be
overwhelmingly white.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we take into account residency, certain underrepresented
counties in the state,'' said Bollinger, the president. ``We take
into account geography _ where you're from in the United States, or
if you're from a foreign country _ or if you're an athlete or a
musician, or if your parents went here. And yes, we try to get a
diverse student body by taking into account race.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics point out that the admissions system gives 20 points for
being black or Hispanic and only 12 points for scoring a perfect
1,600 on the SAT That, they say, is evidence that race is not just
an admissions factor but often the predominant one.
</P>
<P>
   University officials reply that such a comparison is misleading,
since the largest number of points _ 40 _ is given for high school
grades, and that standardized test scores generally do not reveal
much more than do grades about an applicant's scholastic abilities.
</P>
<P>
   As the date of court arguments draws closer, even some students
who support affirmative action say they wonder whether the robust
exchange of ideas envisioned by Powell, who died last August,
actually occurs here. A number of students interviewed on the last
day of classes in April say that, as at other universities, there
is a certain racial balkanization at Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Fraternities tend to be overwhelmingly white or overwhelmingly
black. African-American students tend to sit at their own tables in
the cafeteria or gather alone on the steps of the student union on
Saturday nights to socialize. Even the many clubs that are evidence
of diversity are also evidence of a certain separateness: there are
Hispanic groups, Asian groups, grous that are predominantly white.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most students here do not try to make it happen,'' Carl
Lawson, a black senior from Highland Park, Mich., said of students'
developing relationships across racial lines. ``We tend to stay
around people that are just like we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gurin, the professor who cited data in support of
affirmative action's benefits, acknowledged that there was some
self-imposed segregation on campus. But any talk that it is
widespread, she said, is ``overblown.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of the Michigan suits in the district
court, both sides agree, the matter is headed for appeal. And the
university is hoping for a friendlier reception in the 6th Circuit,
based in Cincinnati, than the University of Texas received in the
conservative 5th.
</P>
<P>
   But no one can predict that the program will survive the 6th
Circuit's judgment, or, if it is struck down, whether the Supreme
Court will hear an appeal. Michigan officials, though, are banking
that their strategy will carry the day. As Liz Barry, the
university's associate vice president and deputy general counsel,
put it, .
</P>
<P>
   ``We think our arguments that Bakke is good law and is the law
of the land right now are overwhelming.''

ON SCHEDULE, CHINESE PROTESTERS TAKE THEIR SHOTS AT U.S. EMBASSY

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Chinese officials choreographed protests against the
U.S. Embassy here on Monday, with a relentless procession of tens
of thousands of demonstrators that lasted into the night.
</P>
<P>
   The marchers, who protested the bombing of the Chinese embassy
in Belgrade during a NATO raid on Friday, were ushered by police
officers to within 25 feet of the embassy. Many chanted ``Down with
American imperialism!'' and sang the Chinese national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   The protests were more controlled than those over the weekend.
But young men continued to heave pieces of brick against the
battered facade right over the helmeted militiamen, who were
apparently under orders only to prevent an outright invasion.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the situation over the weekend, when tens of
thousands of spontaneous anti-NATO protesters roamed almost at
will, the Beijing authorities had protest groups keep to a schedule
and designated their route through the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The governing Communist Party appeared to be attempting to
harness public passions to its own use. On Sunday and Monday,
government offices and social organizations in Beijing were
reportedly ordered to hold meetings and issue denunciations of the
embassy damage, which were duly reported by the press.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the protesters on Monday were university students and
faculty members, and some state companies were also allowed to send
large delegations. Demonstrators said that as their organizations
applied for permission to come to the embassy, the Public Security
Bureau told them when and where to assemble.
</P>
<P>
   High school students, workers and others who showed up on their
own at the staging point were allowed either to tag along with an
approved group or to wait until enough strays had gathered to form
their own marching squad. As the night wore on, more agitated
workers and other citizens streamed in, some of them defying police
directions.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of how well the day's protests were staged,
representatives of major official religious groups arrived and
marched in sequence _ dozens of Buddhist monks, followed by a
contingent of Tibetan monks, then Taoist monks, then Catholic,
Protestant and Muslim leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I am a Chinese, why do you think I shouldn't come?''
snapped a Tibetan monk in a scarlet robe when he was asked why he
was marching.
</P>
<P>
   While Americans have been advised to exercise caution, the U.S.
Embassy has not ordered dependents to leave. International schools
have closed. Because of safety concerns, American consular
officials in Chengdu, where the official residence was burned early
Sunday, and in Shenyang have moved into hotels.
</P>
<P>
   At the American and British embassies, the government deployed
thousands of troops from the People's Armed Police, a special
anti-riot force under the military.
</P>
<P>
   The American ambassador remained in the embassy for the third
day, living on military rations.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon the Chinese foreign minister, Tang Jiaxuan,
telephoned the ambassador, James Sasser. Tang relayed four demands
to ``U.S.-led NATO'' regarding the bombing of China's embassy,
which killed three Chinese and set off the anti-American explosion
here.
</P>
<P>
   The demands, as described by Chinese authorities, were these:
</P>
<P>
   _An ``open and official apology'' to China and the victims'
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   _A thorough investigation.
</P>
<P>
   _Prompt disclosure of the results of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   _``To punish severely those responsible for the attack.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Sasser said he had complained in
return to the foreign minister that the state-run news media have
not reported the regrets already offered by President Clinton,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the ambassador himself.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sasser has been stuck in the embassy since Saturday, along with
two political officers, eight marines and two security officers.
The American security officials decided it was too dangerous for
those inside to move through the hostile crowds, which have never
dispersed entirely.
</P>
<P>
   At one point on Sunday, when a frenzied crush seemed in danger
of overwhelming Chinese police guards, the Americans destroyed
``extensive amounts of sensitive material,'' Sasser said.
</P>
<P>
   Some demonstrators have been calling for a military response to
the Belgrade bombing. But even the most temperate among the
demonstrators, along with many people who did not march, are saying
President Clinton has not done nearly enough to atone for the
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll stop demonstrating only when America admits it made a
mistake and apologizes,'' said Sun Qingqiang, 30, an official in a
state aerospace corporation, as he waited his turn to shout at the
embassy. Sun said he had heard on foreign radio broadcasts about
Clinton's letter of regret but said, ``Clinton's apology was fake,
it was insincere.''
</P>
<P>
   Peng Weijun, a 20-year-old student of traditional medicine,
cracked a brick from the sidewalk in half as he approached the
embassy. ``Even throwing rocks can't express my true feeling of
anger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state-run news media continued to stoke outrage, repeating
that the bombing was an intentional criminal act. If anything,
public passions seem to be intensifying.
</P>
<P>
   With an angry fax, cultural authorities canceled the invitation
for the Boston Symphony to perform this week in Beijing. Monday
night, some cab drivers refused to pick up Americans, and in the
embassy district, people gathered on street corners to discuss how
China could exact military revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers filled with inflammatory accounts of the embassy
bombing and one-sided coverage of the conflict over Kosovo are
selling out quickly. Many people spend their evenings avidly
watching television news programs that have shown, for example,
wrenching scenes of a Chinese victim's father in Belgrade sobbing
as he handles his dead daughter's blood-stained quilt.
</P>
<P>
   This evening's national news broadcast also showed chanting
soldiers as a voice said, ``The powerful army of the Chinese people
will never tolerate the atrocity committed by the U.S.-led NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the bombing of the Chinese embassy, President Jiang
Zemin was under strong pressure from the military and the public to
take a stronger stance against the American-led air attacks in
Yugoslavia, which China calls illegal aggression. But Jiang has few
practical options and may be reluctant to destroy the improved
relations he has cultivated with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   China announced Monday morning that it was suspending its
official dialogue with the United States over human rights and
postponing high-level military contacts and consultations on
weapons proliferation, arms control and international security. No
mention was made of the negotiations on China's entry to the World
Trade Organization, which are at a climactic phase.
</P>
<P>
   Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia's special envoy on the Yugoslav
crisis, suddenly arrived here today for consultations. Russia and
China are the strongest opponents of the NATO air attacks, and many
Chinese say the United States has proved to an unreliable
international partner, thus China must develop closer ties with
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   By general agreement, the champion of the day for creative
visual effects among the demonstrators was the contingent of
hundreds from the Central Academy of Arts. Ten years ago, in the
pro-democracy demonstrations on Tiananmen Square, students from
this institution erected the famous Goddess of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, academy students carried a panoply of creative
posters vilifying the United States. Some carried a giant replica
of Picasso's 1937 antiwar mural, ``Guernica,'' this one spattered
with red paint. Others had made a giant cardboard Statue of Liberty
with the face of Bill Clinton and with the figure holding a bloody
bomb instead of a torch.

ECONOMIC SCENE: 1ST ROUND IN BOTTLE BATTLE GOES TO RALPH LAUREN 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They could have avoided all of this by teaming up and calling it
Eternal Romance.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Calvin Klein, the designer, sued his rival, Ralph
Lauren, over perfume _ well, actually the bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agree that their fragrances smell nothing alike, but
Calvin Klein, maker of Eternity, is miffed at Ralph Lauren, which
introduced Romance last year. Calvin Klein contended the bottle for
the new perfume looked suspiciously like Eternity's.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge, though, has ruled that consumers are not likely
to be confused by the packaging and that surveys Calvin Klein used
to bolster its case were flawed. He denied the preliminary
injunction Calvin Klein sought in the case, which is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Klein's fragrance unit, Calvin Klein Cosmetics Co., and
one of its licensees, Conopco Inc., is suing Polo Ralph Lauren
Corp. and L'Oreal SA's Cosmair Inc., a Ralph Lauren licensee.
</P>
<P>
   In its motion for an injunction, Calvin Klein had sought to stop
Ralph Lauren from selling or advertising Romance, saying that the
bottle and product packaging infringe on its trademark. U.S.
District Judge John Sprizzo in New York rejected the contention
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives for Calvin Klein's cosmetics unit declined to
comment Monday. The company issued a statement saying simply that
the preliminary injunction had been denied and that no trial date
had been set.
</P>
<P>
   Ethan Horwitz, a lawyer for Ralph Lauren, said the decision
``comes down on every point our way.'' Horwitz added that Calvin
Klein's assertion that the bottles were identical was the
equivalent of saying different makes of cars look alike. ``The more
educated you are, obviously, you can tell the difference between a
Volkswagen and a Cadillac.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eternity bottle, tall and thin with a curved T-shape cap,
has an almost hourglass appearance. The Romance bottle is short and
squat, with a flat, square cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apart from the dissimilarity of the two bottles,'' the judge
said in his ruling, ``the likelihood of consumer confusion is also
minimized by the differing marking techniques'' on the packaging,
and the prominent ``Romance'' name on the bottle cap and box of the
Ralph Lauren product.
</P>
<P>
   While Calvin Klein maintains that it had developed a distinctive
bottle for its $180-an-ounce perfume, similar packaging apparently
has been around for, well, eternity.
</P>
<P>
   In the ruling denying the injunction, the judge said that the
Eternity bottle ``is quite similar to perfume bottles used by past
and present fragrance designers.''

   WASHINGTON _ NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade
threatens to drag out a diplomatic solution in Kosovo and to sour
an already-troubled relationship with China, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Although administration officials were confident at first that
the crisis would soon blow over, they now see signs that the
Chinese government will delay a U.N. Security Council resolution
requiring an international security force in Kosovo, a senior
administration official said. That resolution is at the heart of a
proposed diplomatic settlement to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than vetoing such a resolution outright, the Chinese
signaled Monday that they would try to obstruct the
administration's diplomatic strategy by demanding that NATO halt
its bombing against Yugoslavia before the Security Council could
consider any other action on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations on Monday, the Chinese ambassador, Qin
Huasun, said that suspending the air strikes was an essential
precondition to any discussion by the Security Council on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything short of that is impossible for the U.N. Security
Council to discuss any plan to solve the problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing may also imperil negotiations over the entry of
China into the World Trade Organization. Anti-Western officials in
Beijing are using the embassy bombing to make their case against
economic concessions that Prime Minister Zhu Rongji offered during
his trip to Washington last month.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Chinese would benefit from entry into the trade
organization, the Clinton administration has based much of its
strategy for improved relations with China on extending economic
ties. But just as anti-Americanism is riding high in Beijing,
anti-Chinese anger is simmering on Capitol Hill among those who
believe that Washington as been too lax on security and should not
be abetting China's grand entry onto the world economic stage..
</P>
<P>
   A deal with the Chinese on their entry into the trade group
needed to be accomplished in the next few months when Congress
would be most amenable, officials said Monday. But the events of
the last few days have jeopardized the administration's hope for a
speedy timetable.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, concerned that the Chinese continue to refuse
his explanation that the bombing was a mistake, apologized for the
third time Monday. He sent a letter to the Chinese president, Jiang
Zemin, Sunday and publicly expressed regrets Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say to the Chinese people and to the leaders of
China, I apologize. I regret this,'' Clinton said in remarks before
a ceremony on youth and violence at the White House, after China
demanded that the United States apologize.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic, used the
crisis over the air strike to pile more pressure on the
administration by announcing a partial withdrawal of his forces
from Kosovo. The announcement did not state how many of his
estimated nearly 50,000 troops in Kosovo would be removed.
</P>
<P>
   There were differences in tone in the reaction of various
Clinton officials. The secretary of state, Madeleine Albright,
dismissed the announcement as a ``half-measure.'' Clinton said,
``I'm encouraged by any good word.'' But he insisted, like other
NATO officials who were cautious in their reaction, that other
terms must be met to reach a settlement. ``I think that the
conditions that we set out are the minimal ones to make this
work,'' the president added.
</P>
<P>
   As the administration worked at holding its Kosovo policy
together, the Russian envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin, arrived in
Beijing to talk to Chinese officials about Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, who is looked upon by the administration as one of
the best hopes for pushing a diplomatic solution with Milosevic,
changed his travel plans after the embassy strike and headed for
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said they assumed that because
the Russians were eager to play a predominant role in finding a
solution in Kosovo, Chernomyrdin would encourage the Chinese to be
reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the image of senior officials of two anti-NATO
countries, China and Russia, meeting over Kosovo, the place where
NATO's future hangs in the balance, was a little unsettling for
administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the officials said, they were confident
Chernomyrdin would ask the Chinese not to block a Security Council
resolution on the international security force.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Russians, the United Nations is an important venue,
and it's important for them to argue back home that they've brought
this issue back to the United Nations and out of the hands of
NATO,'' a Russia expert in the administration said. ``I think their
position to the Chinese is going to be: `Don't screw up the
possibility of a Security Council resolution. Let's try and get it
closer to our terms.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council became a pivotal part of the solution
in Kosovo last week when the seven richest industrial countries and
Russia agreed in Germany to a set of principles that would end the
war.
</P>
<P>
   Among the principles was an international security force for
which Russia and the seven countries said they would seek to get a
U.N. mandate.
</P>
<P>
   When NATO accidentally bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade,
the strategy for a Security Council mandate was put in jeopardy
because of China's veto power. Beijing illustrated how it could use
that veto earlier this year when it vetoed the continuation of a
U.N. force patrolling in Macedonia.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said during the
weekend that he believed the Chinese would not exercise their veto
on the international force.
</P>
<P>
   Berger argued that the Chinese have been against the NATO
bombing since its start. ``Vetoing the force would put them in the
position of wanting to prolong the bombing and being against
peace,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   But others in the administration were not so sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hoping to get the ball rolling in New York at the
United Nations this week but that has all been put off,'' said a
State Department official. ``The question is how far has this set
us back and for how long. Whether the Chinese will calm down in a
week or two is not at all clear.'
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council met for two hours Monday to discuss the
bombing of the embassy but came to no conclusion on a Chinese draft
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese wanted the council to adopt a statement condemning
the bombing as a ``blatant encroachment on the sovereignty of a UN
member state.'' It asked NATO to ensure that ``all individuals
responsible for the incident be brought to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement was supported by Russia and Namibia and opposed by
five NATO members of the Council: the United States, Britain,
France, Canada and the Netherlands. All council statements, formal
or informal, require the agreement of all 15 members of the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the issue of Kosovo, the White House was faced with
repairing damage to the foundation of its relationship with
Beijing, one that Clinton has tried to cultivate as a legacy of his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Some administration officials took heart from the fact that the
policy of engagement and the two summit meetings by the two leaders
in the past two years meant that there was some depth from which to
work. But others said they were concerned that the anti-Americanism
unleashed by the embassy bombing portended for great difficulties
in restoring a semblance of trust.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the embassy also occurred at a trying time in
China's domestic politics _ when unemployment is soaring, the
conservatives are challenging the modernizers and the 10th
anniversary of the killings of hundreds of protesters in Tiananmen
Square looms next month.
</P>
<P>
   China's suspension of high-level military ties, and talks over
arms control, international security and human rights in protest of
the bombing meant that contacts between Washington and Beijing were
at their lowest since 1995 when relations plummeted over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The suspended meetings covered issues that the Clinton
Administration cares greatly about: accusations that China has
provided nuclear weapons or missile technology to Pakistan and
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   To show its pique, China called off a visit by the Boston
Symphony Orchestra and curtailed a visit by the German Chancellor,
Gerhard Schroeder. In another sign of irritation, when the White
House suggested that Clinton would like to call Zemin to express
his condolences, the Chinese said they would prefer that Clinton
send a letter.
</P>
<P>
   The president said in the letter that he looked forward to
speaking to him ``when he is ready,'' the White House spokesman,
Joe Lockhart said.

ALITALIA TO BE THIRD PARTNER FOR NORTHWEST AND KLM
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alitalia said Monday it intended to join Northwest
Airlines and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines in a broad partnership that
would combine their services over the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The three airlines said they would sell seats on one another's
flights, coordinate schedules and pricing, integrate their
frequent-flier programs, share facilities and combine marketing,
advertising and some back-office tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest and KLM have jointly operated in this way since 1993.
Their link helped usher in a wave of international airline
alliances that has picked up momentum recently.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement, which was made by representatives of the
three airlines at a news conference in Manhattan, had been expected
in the wake of an aviation treaty between the United States and
Italy completed in November.
</P>
<P>
   Under that open-skies accord, Italian and American carriers are
free to fly back and forth between the two countries without
restrictions on where and how often they can land. In exchange,
Washington agreed that Alitalia would be granted immunity from
antitrust laws if it entered into an alliance with a domestic
carrier. The three airlines involved in this tie-in must still
apply to the Department of Transportation for approval, but that is
seen as a formality.
</P>
<P>
   Alitalia has struggled financially in recent years, but its
Milan, Italy, airport hub is considered one of the most promising
in Europe because it has much room for expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Alitalia previously entered into a partnership with KLM and also
has an agreement with Continental Airlines, which in turn is allied
with Northwest. Later this year, the four airlines are expected to
announce a broader international alliance called Wings. It will
compete with the Star Alliance, which includes United Airlines and
Lufthansa, and One World, which is anchored by American Airlines
and British Airways.
</P>
<P>
   Separately Monday, American and Japan Airlines began selling
seats on each other's flights in Asia and North America. The
arrangement allows American to expand its network into Asia while
giving Japan Airlines greater reach in North and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Candace Browning, an aviation analyst with Merrill Lynch in New
York, said the Northwest-KLM partnership had proved to be one of
the most profitable alliances. Northwest now handles KLM's North
American sales, which allowed the Dutch carrier to lay off several
hundred employees in the United States. KLM in turn handles sales
for Northwest in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But the two airlines struggled for years to make the partnership
work, a challenge that they are expected to again face with
Alitalia.

 &HT;    Vaughn trying hard not to 'stink'
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Greg Vaughn promised anybody who would listen all
through his darkest days of April, ``I won't stink it up forever.''
</P>
<P>
   So, are better days ahead? Is the odor gone?
</P>
<P>
   Going into tonight's opener of a two-game series against the
Milwaukee Brewers, Vaughn has hit three home runs and driven in
four runs the past two games as the Cincinnati Reds try to put
something together.
</P>
<P>
   They've won one in a row. Big deal? Well, they haven't won three
in a row all season and only three times have won two in a row in
their first 29 games.
</P>
<P>
   And a lot of it had to do with the inability of their $5.75
million left fielder to put anything together after he hit 50 home
runs and drove in 119 runs for the San Diego Padres _ then became
the first player to hit 50 homers in a season and get traded at the
end of that season.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, though, dropped a tidbit on the media multitude in front
of his locker Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a fast starter, never have been,'' he said. ``Somebody
pulled my numbers the other day from April of last year and told me
I was only one home run and one RBI off my pace from last year. You
know, you still have to play the game. I'm not a moper or pouter .
. . there are a lot of other important things in the game in
addition to home runs and RBI and that's what I try to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Vaughn only hit five home runs in April last year. He had
four this April. And actually, he had only 12 RBIs last April. This
April he had 13.
</P>
<P>
   In May, June and July he scorched everything _ 12, 10 and 11
homers, 32, 24 and 23 RBIs. He tailed off in August and September
to a combined 12 homers and 28 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and Sammy Sosa are good friends and we talked at length
this weekend,'' Vaughn said. ``We told each other, 'It's going to
be all right for both of us. I looked at the schedule, man, and we
have a lot of baseball left. I'm sitting around banging my head
against the wall and I still have 115 games to play.' And Sammy
said, 'Look at me. Our numbers are just about the same.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said he took a different, more relaxed course after his
chat with Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told (hitting coach) Denis Menke before Sunday's game, 'I'm
going to see how easy I can hit the ball hard. I feel I've been
overswinging and my head's been pulling off the ball, trying to
make things happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With Vaughn and Barry Larkin suffering the April blues, the club
lounged in last place in the National League Central, but
Cincinnati has won four of its last six games and captured five of
the last six series and while the Reds remain last, they are only 4
games off the pace.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Reds continue to get offensive punch from an
unexpected source, a source that surprised Chicago Cubs manager Jim
Riggleman. Second baseman Pokey Reese, who begins tonight's game
with a seven-game hitting streak, went 7 for 11 in three games
against the Cubs, lifting his batting average to .326.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'd say Reese is the most improved player I've seen
this year,'' Riggleman said. ``He was an automatic out last year,
but he looks to me as if he knows what he is doing with the bat
this year. And he is doing it from the difficult No. 8 spot,
batting in front of the pitcher where you don't many good pitches
to hit.

 NEW YORK: Louima's injuries.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Monday, Kornberg and the other lawyers opted to focus largely
on discrepancies in Louima's accounts of the case.
</P>
<P>
   In the most explosive of the statements, Louima said one of the
officers had told him, ``This is Giuliani time! It's not Dinkins
time.'' Louima retracted that statement, which he had voiced to
reporters and to a state grand jury, after federal prosecutors took
over the case and presented it to a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   In the start of his testimony last week, Louima said the
brother-in-law of a nurse at Coney Island Hospital, where Louima
was being treated for his injuries, had advised him to make the
statement. Louima testified that the man told him, ``I must say it
to get the mayor's attention and also to get the attention of the
people responsible for justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning by another defense lawyer, Stephen C. Worth,
Louima acknowledged Monday that he had given more than one version
of the circumstances in which he had purveyed that falsehood.
</P>
<P>
   In a hospital news conference several days after he was
reportedly attacked, Louima said that an officer had made the
``Giuliani time'' remark in the stationhouse restroom as he was
being tortured. But when he falsely reported that statement to a
grand jury at about the same time, Louima said an officer had made
the statement earlier, when he was being arrested in the
disturbance on a street outside a nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put it in a different place, in the bathroom rather than
on the street?'' asked Worth, who represents Officer Charles
Schwarz, charged with holding Louima down while Volpe shoved the
stick into his rectum and then his mouth in the stationhouse
restroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Louima replied.
</P>
<P>
   But Louima refused to agree with Worth that the idea for the
``Giuliani time'' statement had come not from the nurse's
brother-in-law, but from lawyers who represented Louima at the
outset of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Worth said that those lawyers, who were replaced, had possibly
gotten the idea from the Rev. Al Sharpton in discussions about
``how they were going to spin your case,''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, sir,'' Louima responded.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Louima might face prosecution for his admitted
lies to the grand jury, a prosecutor, Loretta Lynch, declined to
comment. But it seems highly unlikely that the federal prosecutors
who have forcefully painted Louima as suffering grievously from
what they have called a ``depraved'' and traumatic assault would
prosecute him for perjury committed in the aftermath of that
alleged attack.
</P>
<P>
   In the only moment of drama in an otherwise long day of thrust
and parry by the defense lawyers and Louima, Worth asked if Louima
could identify Schwarz as the man who prosecutors say drove Louima
to the police station after his arrest and then held him down,
handcuffed, in the station's restroom while Volpe tormented him.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the witness box, Louima scrutinized the table where
all the defendants and nearly a dozen lawyers sat and said of
Schwarz, ``It looks like the driver, but I'm not sure.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first day of testimony last Thursday, Louima had
identified Volpe as the man who tortured him in the stationhouse
restroom.
</P>
<P>
   The other two officers on trial, Thomas Wiese and Thomas Bruder,
are charged with taking part with Volpe and Schwarz in beating
Louima in the police car. A fifth defendant, Sgt. Michael Bellomo,
is accused of trying to cover up the alleged beating in the police
car.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The contradictions and inconsistencies in Louima's accounts, as
cited by defense lawyers, had to do with matters like whether a
second officer restrained Louima in the restroom while Volpe
attacked him, whether Volpe or another officer put him in a cell
after the attack and how many officers allegedly kicked him in the
groin in the restroom.
</P>
<P>
   Often Louima said he did not remember answers he had given in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think you can just say I don't remember every time you
don't want to give an unpleasant answer?'' Worth said.

 NBC Plans New Net Company
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Deborah Solomon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Attempting to take its ``Must See TV'' might to cyberspace, the NBC
television network yesterday said it is partnering with two leading
Internet companies to create a consumer-friendly Web portal.
</P>
<P>
   NBC will form a separate, publicly held Internet entity called
NBC Internet. NBCi, as the firm will be known, will incorporate
content from two San Francisco firms: Xoom.com, an online community
center, and Snap.com, a joint venture between NBC and Cnet that
provides news and searching.
</P>
<P>
   The three companies are hoping to create a broad,
general-interest site that will attract millions of users by
leveraging NBC's brand-name with Snap.com's rich content and
searching, and Xoom.com's e-commerce expertise.
</P>
<P>
   NBCi will be headed by Chris Kitze, the chairman of Xoom.com,
and will be headquartered in San Francisco. Kitze said NBCi will
have about 300 employees, mostly in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   The site will operate under the Snap.com name and will have Web
searching capabilities, e-mail, e-commerce, online chat and NBC
content, such as video from ``Saturday Night Live,'' the companies
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``NBC's Internet strategy is to take their viewers and turn them
into users,'' said Lawrence Marcus, who follows Internet stocks for
BancBoston Robertson Stephens in San Francisco. ``They are driving
eyeballs from TV _ which is the most pervasive, powerful and
persuasive media there is _ online, where they can perform
transactions and get additional information, courtesy of NBC.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the ``Must See TV'' viewership was a main factor in
Xoom.com's decision to merge its site with NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to have a TV partner who could drive significant
amounts of viewers to the Web site,'' said Kitze. ``We believe at
the end of the day, the winners on the Internet are the ones that
have real brands. There are billions of dollars of brand equity
tied up in the NBC brand. I think it's safe to say you'll see a big
peacock on our site.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal does not include MSNBC, the 50-50 joint venture between
NBC and Microsoft Corp. However, Snap.com will continue to give
MSNBC ``premium positioning'' on the new site, the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   NBCi will spend $380 million to advertise on NBC TV over the
next four years and will buy another $500 million in advertising
over the following six years.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric, which owns NBC, will own about half of NBCi.
Xoom.com will own 34 percent and Cnet and Snap.com option holders
will own a 13 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Xoom.com zoomed $6.75 to $81.88. Cnet, which is based
in San Francisco, rose $22.44 to $136.20. GE shares fell $1.20 to
$108.75.
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers placed the value of the new company between
$3.5 billion and $4 billion _ far less than other major Internet
portals such as Yahoo, which has a market value of $31 billion.
However, analysts said Wall Street's ``dot com'' frenzy would most
likely propel NBCi's value far beyond its initial worth, giving its
backers the leverage to do additional mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination will be worth considerably more than these
properties are worth as they stand alone,'' said Ryan Jacob, a
portfolio manager for the Internet Fund, which owns shares of
Xoom.com.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies such as Yahoo and Excite are in a race to
build one-stop-shopping sites for Web surfers. These sites offer
news and other content, plus the ability to buy products, send
e-mail and chat. The more the sites offer, the more ``eyeballs'' or
users they attract. That translates into advertising dollars for
the site's operators, who can command more money for a highly
trafficked site.
</P>
<P>
   Kitze said NBCi would be the seventh-largest site on the
Internet and would be available within three to four months.
</P>
<P>
   Both Xoom.com and Snap.com are among the top 20 most visited
sites on the Web. Xoom.com, which has 7.5 million members, is an
online community offering free services such as home page building,
chat rooms, message boards and online greeting cards. It also does
direct e-commerce _ a service like direct mail, which targets an
individual user with products and services relevant to their
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Snap.com, which is 60 percent owned by NBC and 40 percent by
Cnet, is an Internet portal that provides news and other content,
as well as searching.
</P>
<P>
   The content of those sites will be fused with NBC's current
online assets, which include NBC.com, Videoseeker.com and CNBC.com,
in which NBC owns a 10 percent stake. NBC's other sites include
localized community guides, video clips from its shows and movie
trailers. The CNBC.com site will be launched later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``To users, this means that they will only have to go to one
place _ Snap.com _ on the Web to search, chat with users of like
interest, e-mail ... and purchase products,'' said Marty Yudkovitz,
president of NBC Interactive.
</P>
<P>
   If the merged entity passes regulatory hurdles, NBCi will begin
trading publicly &UR;  &LR; within three to four months, Kitze said. Xoom's
stock would close and NBCi would be traded under a new ticker.

 Why Chevron Wants to Buy Rival Texaco
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Rebecca Smith &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
A merger between Chevron and Texaco, the subject of heated rumors,
would create a company so huge that it could boost profits $1
billion a year simply by trimming expenses a modest 2.5 percent,
analysts said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to accomplish that feat would be to eliminate
duplicative functions. ``Do you really need two sets of oil
geologists for the Gulf of Mexico for instance,'' asked oil stock
analyst Edward Maran of A.G. Edwards in New York.
</P>
<P>
   And since Wall Street values oil companies at roughly 20 times
their earnings, stockholders would be rewarded with a $20 billion
windfall reflected through a higher stock valuation for the merged
company.
</P>
<P>
   Stock analysts said that may be the driving force behind the
rumored Chevron-Texaco deal as well the recent British
Petroleum-Amoco-Arco merger and Exxon-Mobil deal.
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers said Texaco and Chevron have one other big
reason to merge: familiarity with each other's operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two companies have known each other longer than any
other oil companies,'' said Fadel Gheit, oil analyst for Fahnestock
&AMP; Co. in New York. ``They know each other's operations and culture
and strengths and weaknesses. This deal makes better sense to me
than the other deals.''
</P>
<P>
   The two companies have been involved in a joint venture, Caltex,
since 1936, refining and marketing oil products cooperatively in
Asia, the Mideast and Africa. All told, the Caltex partnership
operates in 60 countries from its headquarters in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   The two firms have joined forces on many other projects, as
well, including an alliance formed last year to jointly market
marine fuels.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators certainly would look closely at the deal to make sure
the combined company didn't increase their control of the fuel
marketplace, a huge chunk of which is gasoline stations.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said antitrust problems are pithy since Texaco
surrendered control of many service stations and refineries to a
new partnership with Royal Dutch Shell, called Equilon Enterprises,
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Though they still look like they did, Texaco stations in the
West and Midwest now are operated by Equilon. Texaco has a 44
percent stake in the company and Shell has the remaining 56 percent
interest since its piece of the pie was worth more.
</P>
<P>
   A separate partnership controls Texaco's refineries and service
stations in the East and Gulf States. Motiva Enterprises was
created last year by the pooling of the refining and marketing
assets of Texaco, Shell and Saudi Aramco.
</P>
<P>
   Though these alliances have given Texaco some of the benefits of
a merger without having to actually go through a merger, it could
be a big stumbling block to a deal with Chevron.
</P>
<P>
   Stock analysts already are poring over market share numbers,
trying to ascertain what the impacts of a merger might be on the
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   If Chevron now stepped into Texaco's boots, it might be judged
too large and powerful by antitrust regulators at the Federal Trade
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, the partnering of Chevron, Texaco and Shell would
put 43 percent of all branded outlets in the hands of these
affiliates, far ahead of Mobil-Exxon at 12 percent market share and
Arco at 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That compares with 25 percent share for Chevron, Texaco and
Shell in the Gulf states, the next-highest area of concentration
posed by a Chevron-Texaco merger.
</P>
<P>
   The solution proposed by one analyst is that Shell and Texaco
swap out their holdings in such a way that Texaco would divest its
holdings where Chevron is strong _ to allay antitrust concerns _
and would pick up Shell assets where Chevron is weak.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, that would mean the Chevron-Texaco market share
would drop from 43 percent to 17 percent and Shell's would rise to
26 percent. In the Gulf States, the shedding of Texaco assets would
give Chevron-Texaco a 14 market share and give Shell a 12 percent
market share, according to numbers compiled from federal statistics
by CIBC Oppenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of regulators should be to eliminate some of the
overlap between these companies,'' said Fahnestock's Gheit. ``But
that can be done and if this doesn't go through, I'd be
surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, neither company was commenting on the merger
rumor yesterday, which appears to have been revived over the
weekend by a story appearing in Sunday editions of the Sunday Times
in London.
</P>
<P>
   With most of America's integrated oil companies apparently
``spoken for'' further merger activity will move down to the next
tier of oil companies, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The next names on the list: Conoco Inc., Phillips Petroleum Co.
and USX Marathon Oil.

 Column: Online Insurer InsWeb Gets the Ball Rolling for an  Initial
Offering 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Mark Veverka &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
InsWeb is going public.
</P>
<P>
   As anticipated in a July 3 Street Smarts column, the Redwood
City e-commerce startup has filed documents with the Securities and
Exchange Commission saying it intends to sell shares to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The number of shares, time frame and suggested price range for
the offering were not disclosed in the initial filing. Goldman
Sachs _ which is the lead underwriter for TheStreet.com offering _
will be the lead manager on the InsWeb deal.
</P>
<P>
   Co-managers of the insurance site's IPO are BancBoston Robertson
Stephens; Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette; and E-Offering, the online
underwriter launched by E-Trade and Sanford Robertson, co-founder
of Robertson Stephens. InsWeb executives and their bankers were
unable to comment because of quiet-period restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   InsWeb is a financial services concern that was started by
insurance executives _ as opposed to techies _ who believed that
their rather staid and conservative industry was ripe for the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   InsWeb was founded by chief executive Hussein Enan, a 30-year
underwriting industry veteran who scrapped his retirement plans
after hanging around the house watching his son surf the Net. Enan
cobbled together a group of major insurance companies to experiment
and invest in a Web site that would attempt to make buying
insurance easier and less costly for all involved.
</P>
<P>
   InsWeb doesn't sell insurance _ which some Web purists argue is
a shortcoming _ but instead is a matchmaker. It allows consumers to
compare insurance rates online from companies that have
prequalified them for a policy. The site aims to simplify the
process and tries to cut down the amount of time it takes to get a
quote from an insurer.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the business model clearly identifies how InsWeb
can make money. Insurance customers aren't charged anything.
Instead, revenues are collected from the insurance companies listed
on the site.
</P>
<P>
   InsWeb offers life, health and auto policies with more than 30
carriers, including such heavyweights as AIG, the Hartford, John
Hancock, State Farm, Mutual of Omaha, CNA and Nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   What makes InsWeb even more interesting is that two major
insurers are big shareholders. Insurance Information Exchange,
which is an affiliate of CNA, owns about 19 percent, and Nationwide
holds about an 11 percent stake. The two largest shareholders are
Enan and Softbank _ the Japanese venture capital group _ each
holding roughly 20 percent shares.
</P>
<P>
   Softbank has invested about $100 million in InsWeb during two
rounds of financing, which places a pre-IPO value on InsWeb of
about $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   An early stage investor was Sequoia Capital, the Menlo Park
venture capital company known for investing in such high-tech
superstars as Cisco, Apple and Oracle. However, Sequoia did not
show up in the filing as a shareholder with holdings of 5 percent
or more.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that the insurance market is massive _ U.S insurance
customers spend nearly $700 billion a year _ InsWeb is the rare
Internet offering that could show profits sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MATTHEWS FUND &LR; : Wow. I guess it's fair to say that Chronicle
readers are bullish on Japan. After last week's item on the
launching of the Matthews Japan Fund, Street Smarts' voice and
electronic mailboxes were inundated with queries about how to
invest in the fledgling offshore fund. Here's the skinny: The fund
has yet to be assigned a ticker symbol. But you may invest in the
no-load fund, which was launched April 15, via discount brokerages
such as Charles Schwab and Fidelity Investments. These outlets are
not supposed to charge any additional fees for taking your order.
</P>
<P>
   If you have questions about the fund, would like a prospectus or
would like to invest directly, you may do so by calling Matthews
International at (415) 788-6036. Of course, Street Smarts is
passing this information on as a courtesy and doesn't endorse this
or any fund.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Street Smarts runs every Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday. Mark
Veverka can be reached by mail at 901 Mission St., San Francisco,
Calif. 94103, by phone at (415) 777-8444 or by e-mail at

<HEADLINE>
EDWIN DALE JR., 75, REPORTER, AND AN EXPERT IN ECONOMICS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Edwin L. Dale Jr., a former economics reporter in
the Washington bureau of The New York Times who later explained the
intricacies of supply-side economics as a budget spokesman in the
Reagan administration, died Monday at the Washington Hospice.
</P>
<P>
   He was 75 and was visiting in Washington when he died. He had
homes in Delray Beach, Fla., and Osterville, Mass., on Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was lung cancer, said his wife, Meredith.
</P>
<P>
   Dale worked for the Times from 1955 to 1976. In his journalistic
work, economists often found him as knowledgeable as they were. For
example, Dale was credited by economists with being one of the
first to establish that the roots of inflation lay as much in the
service sector as in the pricing of goods. He came to this insight
in the 1950s and helped bring it to public awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Laitin, a spokesman for government agencies including the
treasury department, said, ``One budget director commented to me
after an interview that this man Dale was qualified to be budget
director.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Volcker, the economist, said, ``It was pretty wild and
woolly when I was chairman of the Federal Reserve, and he was a
voice of calm, common sense during that period.''
</P>
<P>
   Volcker said that when Dale became the spokesman for David
Stockman, director of the Office of Management and Budget under
President Ronald Reagan, ``I thought that was a waste of a good
journalist, going to the budget bureau.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale was born in Philadelphia and went to Yale University, where
he was managing editor of The Yale Daily News and graduated in
1944, in time to serve as a naval officer in the Pacific in World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   His first newspaper job was with The Worcester (Mass.) Evening
Gazette in 1947 and he was an economics reporter for The New York
Herald Tribune before joining the Times.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Dale assisted on an important scoop on the escalation
of the war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Karnow, in his 1983 book ``Vietnam: A History,'' wrote
that Rep. William Moorhead of Pennsylvania held a party at his home
in Washington that was attended by Dale and Townsend Hoopes, the
under secretary of the Air Force. Hoopes, Karnow said, had turned
against the war and ``hinted to Dale that a faction of the Pentagon
was forming to resist a troop buildup in Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   Acting on Dale's hint, the Times was able to report on March 10
that President Lyndon B. Johnson was considering a Pentagon request
to call up 206,000 more men at a time when the administration was
proclaiming that Communist forces had been crippled by losses
suffered in their recent Tet offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Dale was the author of ``Conservatives in Power'' (1960,
Doubleday) and the principal author of ``The People's Budget''
(1995, Regency). He was co-editor, with his Times colleague Richard
E. Mooney, of ``Inflation and Recession?'' (1958, Doubleday).
</P>
<P>
   Dale was married to Mary Todd Hastings from 1950 until her death
in 1983. In addition to Mrs. Dale, he is survived by a
stepdaughter, Rosalind C. Dujardin of Bermuda; a stepson, Daniel C.
Cross of Washington, and six step-grandchildren.

EDITORIAL: A CONFERENCE ON YOUTH VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial on Tuesday, May 11:
</P>
<P>
   In the past it was hard not to be struck by the way time seemed
to roll over a tragedy like a school shooting, by the disparity
between the enduring grief of parents who lost children in places
like Paducah and Jonesboro and the swift distraction of the rest of
us. This time, perhaps, things may be different. The Littleton
shootings have forced upon the nation a feeling that many parents
know all too well _ that of inhabiting the very culture they are
trying to protect their children from.
</P>
<P>
   What happened at Columbine High School has for a moment embodied
the violence in our society, allowing us to look directly at it.
The questions it raises make nearly everyone uncomfortable. Do we
have the power to change the culture we inhabit? And, harder still,
do we have the tools to change it without destroying basic freedoms
and without dividing a largely shared culture into warring
fragments?
</P>
<P>
   These questions lay behind Monday's White House strategy session
on children, violence and responsibility. The list of participants
who gathered for three hours in the East Room included
representatives from the administration, from television and motion
pictures, from the gun industry and from the anti-gun industry.
There were medical experts, religious leaders, students, parents,
teachers and executives from the worlds of the Internet and video
games. In short, those who were supposed to bear at least part of
the blame for the climate of the Littleton shootings were seated
next to those who were supposed to find at least part of the
solution.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative agreements that emerged from Monday's meeting are
a measure of the psychic wound inflicted at Littleton. Some
representatives of the gun industry agreed in principle to
legislation raising the legal age of handgun ownership to 21 and to
requiring background checks on the sale of guns at gun shows, as
well as several other measures. Internet executives promised to
develop a ratings system for online video games, and television
executives promised to promote the use of the V-chip.
</P>
<P>
   These commitments, as well as President Clinton's national
grass-roots campaign to prevent youth violence, are all signs of a
consensus that has emerged, in part, out of shock. They will, if
fulfilled, close several important legal loopholes that have made
it hard to keep guns and violent entertainment out of the hands of
children.
</P>
<P>
   But closing legal loopholes, valuable as that is, is not the
same as changing the culture of violence that is visible through
those loopholes. To address a problem so deeply entrenched in the
very habit of being American will require spending a great deal of
political capital, something the White House and Congress have been
reluctant so far to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Responsibility'' was a word used often at Monday's strategy
session, both as a counterbalance to ``blame'' and as a way to
suggest that youth violence cannot be curbed by government action
alone. Most parents feel, rightly, that responsibility begins at
home but that it also begins in the executive offices of the
entertainment and gun industries and in the halls of Congress and
the White House. If the grass-roots campaign the president has in
mind is to work, those are the places its influence must be felt.
</P>
<P>
   What parents want for their children is not just devices that
will screen out the worst choices in an open market. They want
better choices. The urge to do something about youth violence is
very strong, as Monday's meeting evinced, but it will require an
urge to do many things, and to do them with considerable ingenuity
and dedication, before symptomatic violence of the kind that
occurred at Littleton begins to seem truly improbable, not just as
unlikely as the last shooting.

   AVIANO AIR BASE, Italy _ NATO's air commanders plan to open two
new fronts in the bombing campaign against Yugoslavia, launching
strikes from Turkey and Hungary in an effort to surround Yugoslavia
militarily and further isolate it politically, according to allied
officials.
</P>
<P>
   So far, NATO's attacks have been launched from bases in Western
Europe, the United States and from aircraft carriers in the
Adriatic. But now air war commanders plan to attack from the east,
using air bases in western Turkey, and at the same time station
warplanes in Hungary that would strike Yugoslavia from the north.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to increase the political pressure on the Yugoslav
president, Slobodan Milosevic, and help NATO warplanes counter
Serbia's battered, but still resilient, air defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to make Yugoslavia a picture of isolation,'' said
a senior allied officer. ``The optics of the map will show that he
is surrounded, and the air defense systems he has left will be
spread very thin.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said, for example, that Yugoslavia had about 40
SA-6 and SA-3 surface-to-air missile batteries before the war and
that fewer than half were still operational.
</P>
<P>
   The SA-6, which is highly mobile, is the more capable of the
systems. And the Serbs have been moving the SA-6 batteries to both
conceal them and position them along the allies' expected attack
routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be more difficult for them if we attack along multiple
axes,'' said Brig Gen. Jean-Patrick Gaviard, a senior French
officer at NATO's air command center at Vincenza, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the SA-6s are in the south, we can come from the north,
Gaviard said. ``If they are in the center, we can come from the
south. If they only have about 10 SA-6s it will be more difficult
for them if we come from each side.''
</P>
<P>
   Opening up a new front in the air war will also help the
alliance cope with air traffic congestion over Yugoslavia. NATO
planners have done extensive planning to minimize the risk of a
collision by allied warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   And it gives NATO new bases for the hundreds of additional
planes the NATO commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, has requested.
</P>
<P>
   Though arrangements are still being completed, the basic
elements of the plan are clear. NATO plans to deploy U.S. F-15E
planes and F-16CJ fighters at air bases in western Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The role of the F-15Es is to bomb ground targets. F-16CJs
equipped with HARM anti-radiation missiles are used to strike enemy
air defenses. Turkey, which has actively supported the air campaign
against Yugoslavia, is expected to formally approve the
arrangement, NATO officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary has agreed to a similar deployment of U.S. warplanes. It
is allowing 24 FA-18 attack planes and three A-10s to be stationed
on its territory for use against targets in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   American KC-135 refueling tankers are already based at Budapest,
and the Hungarian government has also agreed to let NATO warplanes
use its air space.
</P>
<P>
   Bases, however, are just part of the problem. To enable its
warplanes in Turkey and Hungary to reach their targets, NATO has
asked Bulgaria and Romania for permission to fly over their
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Turkey and Hungary, they are not NATO members. Both,
however, are said to have agreed. Still, considerable coordination,
including agreement on flight paths, is required.
</P>
<P>
   As a former member of the Warsaw Pact, Bulgaria also has many of
the same type of Soviet-made radars as Yugoslavia, and NATO needs
to make sure that the Bulgarian radars are not attacked by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There have already been three cases in which HARM missiles have
accidentally struck Bulgaria, allied officials said.
</P>
<P>
   During the air war over Yugoslavia, NATO warplanes have fired
the HARMs, which home in on enemy radar beams, at Serbian
surface-to-air missile batteries. When the Serbs quickly turned
their radars off, the HARM missiles apparently picked up radar
emissions in Bulgaria and attacked targets there.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid a repeat of these episode, technical adjustment to the
Bulgarian radars might be made. NATO might also persuade Bulgaria
to turn off the radars while allied warplanes are flying nearby or
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   NATO air patrols would then assume the responsibility of
protecting Bulgaria against Yugoslav air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A major advantage of the new arrangement, allied officials said,
is that it will help NATO accommodate the new planes Clark has
requested.
</P>
<P>
   When Clark reviewed his options for reinforcement, allied
officials said, he had three options, code-named ``Baby Bear,''
``Mama Bear'' and ``Papa Bear.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark picked ``Papa Bear,'' the largest option. It will bring
the number of NATO planes to over 1,100 and has sparked an urgent
search for new airfields.
</P>
<P>
   Searching for places where U.S. planes might be based, the Air
Force has sent teams to about 10 countries, including Turkey,
Poland, the Czech Republic and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   The teams are considering a number of factors, including
billeting space for Air Force crews, fuel and maintenance
capabilities, ramp space for the planes and the layout of the
airfields.
</P>
<P>
   Launching attack missions from Turkey and Hungary will also help
the alliance better foil Serb efforts to anticipate the direction
of NATO's attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Serb air defenses have been degraded by weeks of attack. Even
though NATO has flown more than 4,000 bombing missions, only two of
its planes have been shot down by Yugoslav forces: a ``stealth''
F-117 and a F-16 plane.
</P>
<P>
   NATO warplanes also are no longer restricted to operating at
15,000 feet above ground. Some pilots have the flexibility to go
considerable lower, particularly to identify targets.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Yugoslav air defenses remain a worry for pilots. The
Yugoslav Air Defense Force is regarded as one of the most
professional elements of the Serbian military. Unlike the Iraqis,
for example, the Yugoslav force trained for years to counter a
large NATO air attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav military has also polished its tactics by
monitoring NATO air operations for years during the conflict in
Bosnia. And it is adept at hiding in hills and villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to honor it,'' said Maj. Mark Russell, the commander
of the detachment of ABCCC command and control planes here,
referring to the air defense threat.

 AVIANO AIR BASE, Italy: defense threat. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yugoslav air defense capabilities were outlined recently by Gen.
Salko Begic, the Air Force chief for the Muslim-Croat federation in
Bosnia and a former classmate of the Serbian generals now
commanding Yugoslavia's air defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the Yugoslav air defense, he said, is to create a
killing zone below 10,000 feet, using anti-aircraft artillery,
SA-7s and Swedish Bofors air defense missiles, which are very
portable.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs also had SA-3 and SA-6 surface-to-air missile
batteries, which, he said, draw on a network of more than 100
radars. The network also involves observers, including Serbian
agents who monitor NATO aircraft as they take off from bases in
Europe. It is tied together by underground communications lines and
fiber-optic cable.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's goal has been to break the network into pieces so that it
cannot function as an integrated system. Without access to
information from radars throughout the country, the utility of
individual surface-to-missile batteries would be seriously
degraded.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Steve Keim, the commander of the Marine Corps
``Prowler'' EA-6B electronic warfare planes at Aviano, said NATO
was making progress in thwarting the Yugoslav air defenses, but
that it was a complex mission.
</P>
<P>
   The Prowlers' mission is to protect NATO strike aircraft by
locating and jamming Yugoslavia's early warning and targeting radar
systems or by firing HARM missiles at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one thing we can take out that will stop their
systems,'' Keim said. ``If we try to jam an emitter in the south,
there may be a northern one than can relay the information through
a communications link and land line. They are fighting on their own
turf and know where to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the air defense forces have used all of their
ingenuity to survive. The SAM batteries hide during the day. When
they attack at night, they sometimes turn their radars on for 20
seconds and then quickly shut them down to elude attack by HARM
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a long range game,'' said Lt. Col. Steven Searcy, who
commands a squadron of F-16CJ planes, which are equipped with HARM
missiles. ``We've been picking away at him and making dents in his
defenses. Now we are starting to see holes. But it will take us a
long time to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaviard, the French commander, said that the Serbs have been
moving some SA-6s near Belgrade to fill in holes in their air
defense caused by attacks on the SA-3s.
</P>
<P>
   The SA-6s, however, can be loaded on a truck in minutes and
shifted to other regions where the Serbs are expecting an attack.
Attacking from multiple directions, he said, would make the allies'
task that much easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war is very mobile and the Serbs are being clever and
flexible,'' said Gaviard. ``But if we are more flexible we will win
the war.''

EDITORIAL: DIVISIVE POLITICS IN ISRAEL

   The New York Times says in an editorial on Tuesday, May 11: &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Next week's election in Israel will help determine the course of
the peace negotiations with Palestinians and Israel's Arab
neighbors. No less important, however, is the election's likely
impact on achieving peace among Israelis themselves. At a time when
Israelis have generally embraced conciliation with old enemies, it
is startling that the nation is more fragmented than ever on ethnic
and sectarian lines. Could the last curse bestowed by the 20th
century be for Jews to split into feuding tribal divisions, like so
many other countries? To help avoid that fate, Israelis can use the
campaign to reinforce the values of tolerance and inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   A hotly contested election campaign always underscores the
bitterness of any country's divisions. In the current campaign,
politicians representing Jews from Asia, Africa and the Middle East
are feuding with politicians representing Russians over who will
control the Interior Ministry, and the patronage t commands.
Religious Jews are fighting with non-observant Jews over which
customs the government should protect or promote. Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, who is behind in the polls, portrays himself as
the tribune of Israel's ethnic ``outsiders,'' mainly the Oriental
and religious subgroups. Ehud Barak, the Labor candidate, has
dubbed his coalition ``One Israel,'' but recently one of his
supporters created a furor by referring to some Jews as
``riffraff.''
</P>
<P>
   It is dismaying to think that American consultants to both
parties may be encouraging Israeli politicians to exploit their
divisions rather than heal them. But on another level, the
squabbling among subgroups represents a certain healthy maturing of
Israeli democracy. It would be impossible and unwise in any
representative government to avoid or suppress debate over the
benefits of government. The fact that Israelis are now fighting
over these things may also reflect a new consensus that security
issues are less urgent than they used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Israel can nevertheless take some steps to minimize sectarian
and ethnic infighting. The current parliamentary system, in which
the prime minister is elected by one ballot and members of
parliament are elected in a separate vote, seems to exacerbate the
problem and is already being reconsidered. At present, Israelis may
vote for Netanyahu, Barak or other candidates on the overriding
economic or political issues and then exercise their narrow
self-interests by voting for a splinter group for parliament. As a
result, at least 32 parties are fielding candidates for parliament,
and it seems likely that 20 or so parties will be elected in a
parliament with only 120 members. Neither Barak nor Netanyahu, the
front-runners for prime minister, is expected to command more than
a quarter of the seats.
</P>
<P>
   Founded after World War II in fulfillment of the dream of
Zionists, who were largely secular European Jews, Israel fragmented
into factions almost from the beginning. It could not have happened
otherwise, as waves of immigrants from the Mediterranean, Russia
and Africa sought refuge, bringing many of their own religious and
folk beliefs. Though Israel is a democracy with an established
religion, it can find positive values in its diversity.
</P>
<P>
   But for such a system to work, no one form of Judaism should
dictate to others, and Jews must learn to be sensitive to those of
different backgrounds. Israel may have some distance to go on that
score. A recent poll showed that only 56 percent of Israelis
believe that equality of rights existed in their country. An
election that understandably underscores the divisions of society
can nonetheless clear the way for a new civic identity of
inclusiveness and respect for pluralism.

EDITORIAL: TRIFLING WITH HUMANITARIAN AID

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial on Tuesday, May 11: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate negotiators will meet Tuesday to consider two
emergency spending bills that are ostensibly designed to help
people ravaged by natural disasters and by war. As currently
written, however, these bills would also serve as vehicles to
further the political and ideological agendas of powerful members
of both houses. It is an old congressional trick _ find an
emergency bill the president wants, then load it up with
special-interest riders. The White House has threatened a veto, and
rightly so. The conference committee should do everything it can to
avoid a confrontation by stripping the bills of provisions that
have no business being there in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   One bill would provide $600 million in badly needed aid to
Central American victims of Hurricane Mitch. The other would help
underwrite military and humanitarian operations in Kosovo. But the
hurricane relief bill includes compensating budget cuts _ or
``offsets'' _ that would reduce spending for an array of valuable
domestic and foreign programs. The administration argues,
correctly, that budget rules do not require such balancing cuts
when the legislation deals with emergency funding.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Senate version of the bill contains several
anti-environmental riders drafted by Western Republicans, who are
masters of the art of legislation by stealth. One of these would
overturn a legislative compromise that was crafted last year to
phase out commercial fishing in Glacier Bay National Park. A second
would allow oil companies to delay paying their fair share of
royalties on oil they extract from public lands. A third would
delay regulations aimed at curbing irresponsible mining practices.
</P>
<P>
   Other anti-environmental amendments are expected to be offered
Tuesday. One particularly outrageous rider, concocted by Sen. Slade
Gorton, R-Wash., would allow the Battle Mountain Gold Co. to open a
huge waste dump for mining residue in eastern Washington, in
violation of the 1872 Mining Law as well as a recent ruling by the
Interior Department denying the company an operating permit. If
this rider becomes a precedent, it could lead to more mining
pollution throughout the West.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane relief bill is expected to be combined with the
Kosovo bill, then sent to the House and Senate for a floor vote.
The Kosovo funding bill is itself flawed, since the House added
nearly $7 billion in unnecessary defense spending that the White
House opposes. The conference committee needs to clean up this
self-serving legislative mess.

KENNEDY HAS IDEAS ABOUT STADIUM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cal State Northridge plays its home games in one of the worst
college baseball facilities in the country.
</P>
<P>
   There hasn't been a significant movement by the university to
raise funds for the construction of a new stadium. Maybe the
athletic department should know who to ask.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Kennedy, an All-American shortstop at CSUN who got a
$650,000 signing bonus after he was drafted in the first round by
the St. Louis Cardinals in 1997, said the athletic department
hasn't called him since he went pro.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said he would give a portion of his bonus for a new
stadium _ if he knew Matadors head coach Mike Batesole would reap
the benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hate to give something to that school and have
(Batesole) not be around,'' Kennedy said. ``I owe him the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who is a starting middle infielder at Triple-A Memphis,
said his alma mater doesn't appreciate baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``How hard is it to build a nice stadium there?'' he said.
``Look at the Valley, how many kids play baseball. I guess (CSUN)
doesn't understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Batesole, who is finishing his fourth season as the head coach
and looking to sign a new contract, said he hasn't asked Kennedy
about giving back to the program that developed Kennedy into a
potential major-leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said Batesole ``knows where I stand.'' He wouldn't mind
helping out financially for a new stadium ``if coach Batesole was
to be there in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Munson and the draft:On June 2, Eric Munson will be a lottery
winner. His income-tax bracket will be elevated after one 10-minute
phone call.
</P>
<P>
   Munson, USC's All-American catcher, is projected to be among the
first five picks in major-league baseball's amateur draft. Before
the season, he was rated Baseball America as the No. 1 college
player available.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about it,'' he said the day before his return
to the Trojans' lineup earlier this month after he sat five weeks
with a broken hand. ``(The teams) know what I can do. Obviously
it's a big deal, but I'm not going to worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Munson's draft approach indicates two things: (a) He went
through this kind of anticipation before, in 1996. He was a senior
at San Diego's Mt. Carmel High and was drafted in the second round
by the Atlanta Braves. And (b) he has nothing to prove to the
scouts who have watched him play the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   A broken hand doesn't matter much when you're talking about a
guy who should be in the major leagues in two or three years.
</P>
<P>
   Munson will probably get a signing bonus of at least $2 million
from the team that drafts him. Considering he's a catcher, he might
get more because of the scarcity of young good players at his
position.
</P>
<P>
   But this is what Munson says he does care about: getting the
Trojans back to the College World Series. USC, the defending
national champion, will definitely get a bid to the NCAA playoffs,
which expanded from 48 teams to 64 in the offseason. The No. 23
Trojans (31-22) are in a battle to host a first-round regional.
</P>
<P>
   After missing 21 games with the injury, Munson returned to the
starting lineup as the designated hitter against UCLA on May 2. He
went 0 for 2 with a sacrifice fly. Two days later he had two hits,
including a double, and two runs scored in a nonconference win over
San Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Munson) needs some time to go back to being him,'' USC head
coach Mike Gillespie said after the UCLA game.
</P>
<P>
   __ Torresmania: CSUN signed Yucaipa High left-hander John Torres
to a letter of intent. Torres, who is 7-2 with a 1.60 ERA,
resembles Fernando Valenzuela, according to CSUN pitching coach
Jamie Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call him ``Little Fernando'' because he's got that pudgy
body,'' Nelson said, ``but we'll work that off.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Around the horn: UCLA's 3-2 win over USC on May 1 ended a
significant streak: The Bruins won for the first time in 404 games
when scoring three runs or less. . . . Pepperdine's Dane Sardinha,
a sophomore catcher, and Jay Gehrke, a junior reliever, have been
added to Baseball America's ``College Player of the Year watch.''
Sardinha leads the Waves in batting average and Gehrke leads the
nation in saves. . . . CSUN lost its exclusive hold on the NCAA
record for home runs in a game. Alabama slugged 13 homers in a 30-4
rout of Alabama-Birmingham, tying the Matadors' mark set against
Fresno State in 1996.

AIDES FEAR CLINTON'S CHINA DEAL HAS BECOME COLLATERAL DAMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., Mont.)   (jw) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the days just before NATO mistakenly bombed the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, administration officials were already
voicing fears that they might have missed their moment to strike a
political deal to get China into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Such a deal has been the centerpiece of President Clinton's
much-debated effort to build a ``web of engagement'' with Beijing.
Now the hopes of patching it together in a few months are fading,
and White House officials doubt that they will have the political
opportunity to get it through Congress after that.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing has clearly fueled the nationalist sentiments that
were forcing Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, China's leading economic
reformer, to pull back some of the concessions he offered a month
ago.
</P>
<P>
   That, in turn, creates a backlash here. Members of Congress who
were wavering about whether to support the deal that Clinton nearly
had in hand seem virtually certain to reject any accord with lesser
concessions.
</P>
<P>
   But that is only the beginning of the problem. The images of
Chinese tossing bricks at the U.S. Embassy may harden the views of
powerful figures including Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority
leader, who argue that the United States should not aid China's
efforts to seek prestige through membership in the group that sets
the rules of world trade.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has said he opposes China's entry because of Beijing's
alleged espionage efforts and human rights abuses. For its part,
the AFL-CIO has vowed to oppose the deal for fear that American
jobs will be lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the bombing of the Chinese Embassy, it was very
optimistic for the administration to think they could get this
together before the summer,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., who
has been leading the effort in the Senate to get China into the
trade group and whose constituents export farm products to Asia.
Now, he said, ``It's much harder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But to a great extent,'' he said, ``this is now in the hands
of the Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   Baucus is among many inside and outside the administration who
are critical of Clinton's decision to walk away from the
market-opening concessions that Zhu offered last month in
everything from agriculture to foreign ownership of cellular phone
concerns. Had a deal been initialed then, Baucus argues, it would
probably be far less vulnerable now.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to tell, some Clinton aides say, whether the
president himself harbors second thoughts about not having closed
an agreement while Zhu was here.
</P>
<P>
   By some accounts, Clinton castigated a few of his advisers after
Zhu's visit, saying that while the president was focused on Kosovo,
his aides should have been finding ways to quickly close the
negotiating gap.
</P>
<P>
   That outburst led to a last-minute effort to rescue a deal.
Clinton called Zhu in New York on April 13, offering to send
negotiators to Beijing immediately to finish up the talks. They
arrived days after Zhu's return but ran into obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese negotiators, under attack at home for giving so much
away, floated suggestions that the 14-page list of Chinese
concessions that the administration published during Zhu's visit
was no longer on the table. The American team returned home
empty-handed. In the aftermath of the Belgrade bombing, it is
unclear whether they will return to Beijing next week as scheduled.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The best face that administration officials could put on events
Monday was that the well-coordinated protests on the streets of
Beijing might amount to a means for the Chinese to vent their
anger, first at the bombing and second at the widespread sense in
China that the economic concessions demanded for membership in the
trade group were part of some grander plan to check China's
economic rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're hoping,'' one official said, ``is that the
anti-American protests run their course and Zhu can proceed with
his reforms.'' In that case, the reforms would include the kind of
opening of markets that entry into the trade group would require.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a chancy bet. And if it turns out that the embassy
bombing was a turning point _ that the deal within Clinton's grasp
a month ago has become part of the collateral damage of the Kosovo
conflict _ then the effects could be serious and lasting. For the
deal was less about trade than about global strategy, accommodating
China's rising economic power to a world system in which Beijing
still feels treated as an outsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case where they probably could have gotten it
through Congress,'' said Nicholas Lardy, a scholar at the Brookings
Institution. ``Whether they could get the same deal right now is
highly uncertain.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lardy noted that while China suspended various talks with
the United States on Monday, it did not withdraw from the trade
talks.

 By AN WILSON  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ We British had grown used to having a prime minister
who was ignorant, but now a far more worrying thought occurs. Has
he gone mad?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is a question that only doctors could answer. But
Prime Minister Tony Blair's recent self-justifying speeches,
delivered with laryngitic, manic jerkiness, persuade me that war is
almost always an act of madness.
</P>
<P>
   And the rhetoric that he has chosen to employ, with its
pseudo-Churchillian echoes and its allusions to the Second World
War, provoke disturbing, unwelcome thoughts, not merely about the
current conflict in Kosovo, but about the whole of 20th-century
history, and the brave sorrows which our parents' generation
underwent.
</P>
<P>
   The German culture minister, Michael Naumann, recently deplored
the fact that Hitler's war continues to obsess the British. Over
the last few weeks one sees not merely that Herr Naumann is right
but that the British way of viewing the Second World War is deeply
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Blair now seems to be by far the most hawkish of NATO's
leaders. The German peace proposals, which would have involved
bringing in the Russians to persuade Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic to the negotiating table, have been dismissed by Blair as
not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Blair wants blood, toil, sweat and tears; he wants Bill Clinton
to give him the tools and we'll finish the job.
</P>
<P>
   The early identification of Milosevic with Hitler was bizarre.
Milosevic has shown no desire for territorial expansion, let alone
world domination.
</P>
<P>
   The unending story of minor, nasty warfare in the Balkans is
part of the story of the last 1,000 years. It is quite unlike the
resurrection of German nationalism in the 1920s as a reaction
against the unjust Versailles Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Britain went to war against Hitler not because he was
persecuting the Jews, as Blair implies every day, but because of
treaties designed to check German expansionism.
</P>
<P>
   The treaties to ``protect'' Czechoslovakia were quietly
forgotten _ some said to Britain's shame. The treaty to protect
Poland was observed, and it was because Hitler invaded Poland that
Neville Chamberlain declared war.
</P>
<P>
   As AJP Taylor caustically observes in ``The Origins of the
Second World War'': ``In 1938 Czechoslovakia was betrayed. In 1939
Poland was saved. Less than 100,000 Czechs died during the war.
Six-and-a-half million Poles were killed. Which was better _ to be
a betrayed Czech or a saved Pole?''
</P>
<P>
   When we consider the 56 million people _ most of them civilians
_ who died during the Second World War we of a younger generation
can understand why those who watched their comrades die in it were
obliged to tell themselves not only that it was an inevitable
conflict, but that it was the only noble way of defeating an evil
tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   Even this way of thinking only leads to more intolerable
thoughts _ namely that Poland, Czechoslovakia, and all the Eastern
bloc countries were ``liberated'' only in the sense that they were
taken away from the Nazis and given into Soviet slavery at the
insistence of Stalin, who outstripped Hitler in the numbers he
killed.
</P>
<P>
   The one fact about Hitler which nobody believed during the
Second World War was that he meant what he said about the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The British Foreign Office and the BBC consistently refused to
believe the stories of extermination as they began to come through
from Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and elsewhere in the middle years of
the war.
</P>
<P>
   Only in 1945, when people watched the shocking newsreels of
liberated concentration camps did the extent of the Nazi atrocities
become clear.
</P>
<P>
   And of course _ another intolerable thought _ this slaughter
only began after the outbreak of war. Could it be _ intolerable
question _ that it was the cover of war alone which made the
massacres possible?
</P>
<P>
   For Tony Blair to liken Milosevic to Hitler is to trivialize
every one of those 56 million deaths between 1939-45 and to miss
the point which, tragically, they make.
</P>
<P>
   It is not an easy thought. It is literally unbearable, but it
must be thought if politicians are not to go on repeating the
mistakes of the past. It is this.
</P>
<P>
   If the Second World War had never been fought, not only would
those 56 million, most of them, have died in their beds; not only
would the beautiful cities of France, Germany, Italy and Poland
which were destroyed have remained intact, but Hitler and his crazy
regime would almost certainly have been overthrown in the fullness
of time by his own people.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Blair tells us that the Second World War was ``a war started
by a dictator visiting racial genocide on his people.'' He tell us
that. ``You have to come down to the simple clear choice, to act,
or not to act.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't even pseudo-Winston Churchill. It is government by
Biggles.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's and NATO's decision to ``act'' has escalated a war
which, in the three years previous to March 25, 1999, had killed
between two and three thousand people.
</P>
<P>
   To act or not to act. There are so many actions other than
bombing _ to increase aid, for example, to flood a distressed or
war-torn region with hospitals, schools, foreign observers who, if
they can't stop the fighting, can at least ensure that the
atrocities are kept to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO bombing raids have provided the biggest possible cover
for acts of genocidal slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   When one thinks of the war memorials all over Europe, and the
stories of self-sacrifice which they embody, and the unselfish
bravery of our parents' generation, one hardly dares to write these
words.
</P>
<P>
   But the lesson they teach is that war never works, that the
notion of a just war is a political con.
</P>
<P>
   God help us if our world order is now in the hands of those
whose history books are closed and whose moral values are
conceitedly summed up by the doctrine that whatever Blair thinks
and does is right and whatever anyone else does is ``evil.'' &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ Latina mothers across Southern California got a
chance to double dip from the well of pampering by celebrating
Mother's Day on Sunday and again Monday, when it is observed in
Mexico and other Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
   In Arleta, 15 moms gathered at Rosalba Ramirez's house with
their young children to enjoy each other's company, good food and
one of the biggest holidays in their native countries, a day after
the American version.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mothers with that background get to celebrate it twice,'' said
Norma Ramirez, who has been organizing (italics) Dia de las Madres
(end italics) for eight years. ``You get to make some phone calls
to your own mother in Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Carmen Alva, 37, has two sons at Canterbury Elementary School,
the common denominator among many of the mothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use this opportunity to teach our kids about both
celebrations,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   To make the holiday happen, the mothers had to work hard: A trio
of them slaved over a hot stove making (italics) mole (end
italics), the traditional chocolate-based dish. The heart-shaped
corsages they all wore they made for each other.
</P>
<P>
   But it was all about companionship and keeping one holiday alive
as another overshadows it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get into the spirit of friendship and love,'' said
Norma Ramirez, 41. ``It's really hard to do it like you used to do
it in Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Fate dictated that the American celebration of Mother's Day took
place this year a day before May 10, the traditional day of
observation in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Acuna, a Chicano studies professor at California State
University, Northridge, said the (italics) Dia de las Madres (end
italics) is just one of a string of Mexican holidays that fall in
May, including Cinco de Mayo and Labor Day, which is celebrated May
1.
</P>
<P>
   Partly it's a response to warming spring weather. Flowers, as in
the United States, are a Mother's Day staple in Mexico. Missing
from the American celebration, though, are the serenades children
have played for their mothers. No. 1 on the request list is ``Las
Mananitas,'' ``The Morning Serenades,'' Acuna said.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Pamiagua, 17, said her mother, also named Maria, accepted
the flowers her children gave her Sunday but was waiting for this
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's like a big thing,'' the younger Maria said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the two Mother's Days were rolled into one because of
their proximity. Santa Rosa Church in San Fernando usually holds a
special Mass for the Latino celebration but held it on Sunday this
year, said Terry Vinson, who edits the church bulletin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody came with roses for their mothers,'' she said.

 By AN WILSON  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ We British had grown used to having a prime minister
who was ignorant, but now a far more worrying thought occurs. Has
he gone mad?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is a question that only doctors could answer. But
Prime Minister Tony Blair's recent self-justifying speeches,
delivered with laryngitic, manic jerkiness, persuade me that war is
almost always an act of madness.
</P>
<P>
   And the rhetoric that he has chosen to employ, with its
pseudo-Churchillian echoes and its allusions to the Second World
War, provoke disturbing, unwelcome thoughts, not merely about the
current conflict in Kosovo, but about the whole of 20th-century
history, and the brave sorrows which our parents' generation
underwent.
</P>
<P>
   The German culture minister, Michael Naumann, recently deplored
the fact that Hitler's war continues to obsess the British. Over
the last few weeks one sees not merely that Herr Naumann is right
but that the British way of viewing the Second World War is deeply
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Blair now seems to be by far the most hawkish of NATO's
leaders. The German peace proposals, which would have involved
bringing in the Russians to persuade Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic to the negotiating table, have been dismissed by Blair as
not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Blair wants blood, toil, sweat and tears; he wants Bill Clinton
to give him the tools and we'll finish the job.
</P>
<P>
   The early identification of Milosevic with Hitler was bizarre.
Milosevic has shown no desire for territorial expansion, let alone
world domination.
</P>
<P>
   The unending story of minor, nasty warfare in the Balkans is
part of the story of the last 1,000 years. It is quite unlike the
resurrection of German nationalism in the 1920s as a reaction
against the unjust Versailles Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Britain went to war against Hitler not because he was
persecuting the Jews, as Blair implies every day, but because of
treaties designed to check German expansionism.
</P>
<P>
   The treaties to ``protect'' Czechoslovakia were quietly
forgotten _ some said to Britain's shame. The treaty to protect
Poland was observed, and it was because Hitler invaded Poland that
Neville Chamberlain declared war.
</P>
<P>
   As AJP Taylor caustically observes in ``The Origins of the
Second World War'': ``In 1938 Czechoslovakia was betrayed. In 1939
Poland was saved. Less than 100,000 Czechs died during the war.
Six-and-a-half million Poles were killed. Which was better _ to be
a betrayed Czech or a saved Pole?''
</P>
<P>
   When we consider the 56 million people _ most of them civilians
_ who died during the Second World War we of a younger generation
can understand why those who watched their comrades die in it were
obliged to tell themselves not only that it was an inevitable
conflict, but that it was the only noble way of defeating an evil
tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   Even this way of thinking only leads to more intolerable
thoughts _ namely that Poland, Czechoslovakia, and all the Eastern
bloc countries were ``liberated'' only in the sense that they were
taken away from the Nazis and given into Soviet slavery at the
insistence of Stalin, who outstripped Hitler in the numbers he
killed.
</P>
<P>
   The one fact about Hitler which nobody believed during the
Second World War was that he meant what he said about the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The British Foreign Office and the BBC consistently refused to
believe the stories of extermination as they began to come through
from Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and elsewhere in the middle years of
the war.
</P>
<P>
   Only in 1945, when people watched the shocking newsreels of
liberated concentration camps did the extent of the Nazi atrocities
become clear.
</P>
<P>
   And of course _ another intolerable thought _ this slaughter
only began after the outbreak of war. Could it be _ intolerable
question _ that it was the cover of war alone which made the
massacres possible?
</P>
<P>
   For Tony Blair to liken Milosevic to Hitler is to trivialize
every one of those 56 million deaths between 1939-45 and to miss
the point which, tragically, they make.
</P>
<P>
   It is not an easy thought. It is literally unbearable, but it
must be thought if politicians are not to go on repeating the
mistakes of the past. It is this.
</P>
<P>
   If the Second World War had never been fought, not only would
those 56 million, most of them, have died in their beds; not only
would the beautiful cities of France, Germany, Italy and Poland
which were destroyed have remained intact, but Hitler and his crazy
regime would almost certainly have been overthrown in the fullness
of time by his own people.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Blair tells us that the Second World War was ``a war started
by a dictator visiting racial genocide on his people.'' He tell us
that. ``You have to come down to the simple clear choice, to act,
or not to act.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't even pseudo-Winston Churchill. It is government by
Biggles.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's and NATO's decision to ``act'' has escalated a war
which, in the three years previous to March 25, 1999, had killed
between two and three thousand people.
</P>
<P>
   To act or not to act. There are so many actions other than
bombing _ to increase aid, for example, to flood a distressed or
war-torn region with hospitals, schools, foreign observers who, if
they can't stop the fighting, can at least ensure that the
atrocities are kept to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO bombing raids have provided the biggest possible cover
for acts of genocidal slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   When one thinks of the war memorials all over Europe, and the
stories of self-sacrifice which they embody, and the unselfish
bravery of our parents' generation, one hardly dares to write these
words.
</P>
<P>
   But the lesson they teach is that war never works, that the
notion of a just war is a political con.
</P>
<P>
   God help us if our world order is now in the hands of those
whose history books are closed and whose moral values are
conceitedly summed up by the doctrine that whatever Blair thinks
and does is right and whatever anyone else does is ``evil.'' &QL;

<P>
   To misquote Humphrey Bogart: ``Of all the embassies in all the
cities in all the world, we had to hit that one'' _ the mission in
Belgrade of China, the country, after Russia, whose consent is most
vital if a United Nations resolution imposing a Kosovo settlement
is to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   But, remarkably, the signs last night were that the diplomatic
destruction wrought by the misdirected bomb might be less
devastating than initially feared.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, on both sides of the Atlantic a damage limitation
exercise was in full swing, even as the air strikes continued
during the weekend, primarily against communications targets.
</P>
<P>
   As British Prime Minister Tony Blair sent a written apology to
Beijing for NATO's bombing blunder, diplomats labored to ensure
that the outline agreement for a settlement secured last week by
the foreign ministers of the leading Western powers and Russia was
not imperiled.
</P>
<P>
   The most hopeful note, perhaps, lay in what the Chinese
authorities did not say. For all their country's outrage at a ``war
crime'' in which at least three people died, Vice President Hu
Jintao insisted that China would maintain its policy of opening to
the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   Above all he gave no hint whatsoever that China was
contemplating direct diplomatic retaliation related to Kosovo _ the
nightmare scenario which must have flashed across the minds of a
thousand Western officials when they first heard the calamitously
embarrassing news of the strike.
</P>
<P>
   All along it had been assumed that notwithstanding its right of
veto in the Security Council, Beijing had no desire to become
directly embroiled in a crisis 6,000 miles away, in which it had no
direct stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the deal's good enough for the Russians, it'll be good
enough for the Chinese,'' was the typical prediction of one NATO
official last week, after the outline plan agreed in Germany by the
G-8.
</P>
<P>
   But the embassy bombing threatened to change that calculation _
and indeed still might, if the measured official reaction in
Beijing fails to keep demonstrations against American and British
missions under control.
</P>
<P>
   If so, then the Chinese leadership might have no choice but to
be obstructive in the U.N. over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The hope however is that once the indignation subsides, the
Chinese will act according to their interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leadership wants a decent relationship with the U.S.,''
one diplomat said, ``not least because China badly wants to join
the World Trade Organization, something for which Washington's
support is essential.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally reassuring, Russia's commitment to the G-8 deal does not
seem to have been soured by the bombing, despite a predictably
scathing condemnation from Moscow, and the abrupt cancellation by
Igor Ivanov, the foreign minister, of a weekend trip to Britain for
talks with the Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
   After talks in Germany with Chancellor Gerhard Schroder on
Saturday, Moscow's envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin spoke by phone with
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The next step will be a meeting with Strobe Talbott, the U.S.
deputy secretary of state, in Moscow Tuesday, after which
Chernomyrdin said he would be taking ``concrete proposals'' to the
Yugoslav leader before the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``New, very important, developments connected to the Balkan
settlement'' had emerged, he cryptically declared on his return to
Moscow Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   All of which suggests that a draft U.N. resolution could still
be forthcoming within a fortnight, as diplomats had hoped before
the Chinese embassy uproar.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N.'s newly appointed envoy, the former Swedish Prime
Minister Carl Bildt, met Chernomyrdin in Germany. Sunday night he
met the French President Jacques Chirac in Paris, before holding
talks Monday in London with Cook.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the attempts to portray this activity as ``business
as usual,'' the incident will surely affect the dynamics of the
search for an agreed U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
   However fleetingly, President Milosevic's hand has been
strengthened. Public support in the West for the bombing campaign
may falter, and the standing of the Russians has been indirectly
enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   These considerations may make it harder still to come up with a
formula which satisfies NATO, above all on the terms for a halt in
the bombing and on the makeup of the international force to enter
Kosovo to keep the peace and allow more than 700,000 refugees to
return home. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 725. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   For the alliance, the ``effective international civil and
security presences'' foreseen for Kosovo in the G-8 statement must
involve a well-armed force, with a NATO ``core'' and under NATO
command _ even though it may formally be under a U.N. aegis and
contain a substantial Russian contingent.
</P>
<P>
   That was spelled out again Sunday by Cook, who insisted U.S. and
British troops had to take part if the force was to be a credible
protector for the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Most distasteful for the allies, and above all for Britain, the
most hawkish of them, this weekend's developments make it more
likely that in some form or other NATO will at the end of the day
be obliged to negotiate with Milosevic, a man whom London openly
brands a war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Sunday, the Foreign Secretary insisted NATO's
objectives were non-negotiable.
</P>
<P>
   ```We are willing to reach a settlement tomorrow provided
Milosevic accepts those objectives...but this is not a negotiation,
and we will not make a compromise with him.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Cook made equally clear, a full-scale ground war is not in
the cards _ nor is any invasion other than a mopping-up operation
against a Serb resistance battered by months of bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether, after the Chinese embassy debacle,
Western public opinion is ready to wait that long. &QL;

search for an agreed U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
   However fleetingly, President Milosevic's hand has been
strengthened. Public support in the West for the bombing campaign
may falter, and the standing of the Russians has been indirectly
enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   These considerations may make it harder still to come up with a
formula which satisfies NATO, above all on the terms for a halt in
the bombing and on the makeup of the international force to enter
Kosovo to keep the peace and allow more than 700,000 refugees to
return home. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   For the alliance, the ``effective international civil and
security presences'' foreseen for Kosovo in the G-8 statement must
involve a well-armed force, with a NATO ``core'' and under NATO
command _ even though it may formally be under a U.N. aegis and
contain a substantial Russian contingent.
</P>
<P>
   That was spelled out again Sunday by Cook, who insisted U.S. and
British troops had to take part if the force was to be a credible
protector for the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Most distasteful for the allies, and above all for Britain, the
most hawkish of them, this weekend's developments make it more
likely that in some form or other NATO will at the end of the day
be obliged to negotiate with Milosevic, a man whom London openly
brands a war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Sunday, the Foreign Secretary insisted NATO's
objectives were non-negotiable.
</P>
<P>
   ```We are willing to reach a settlement tomorrow provided
Milosevic accepts those objectives...but this is not a negotiation,
and we will not make a compromise with him.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Cook made equally clear, a full-scale ground war is not in
the cards _ nor is any invasion other than a mopping-up operation
against a Serb resistance battered by months of bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether, after the Chinese embassy debacle,
Western public opinion is ready to wait that long. &QL;

BOMBING IMPEDES DEALS ON KOSOVO AND CHINA TRADE STATUS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade
threatens to drag out a diplomatic solution in Kosovo and to
inflict long-term damage an already-troubled relationship with
China, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Although administration officials were confident at first that
the crisis would soon blow over, they now see signs that the
Chinese government will delay a U.N. Security Council resolution
requiring an international security force in Kosovo, a senior
administration official said. That resolution is at the heart of a
proposed diplomatic settlement to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than vetoing such a resolution outright, the Chinese
signaled Monday that they would try to obstruct the
administration's diplomatic strategy by demanding that NATO halt
its bombing against Yugoslavia before the Security Council could
consider any other action on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations on Monday, the Chinese ambassador, Qin
Huasun, said that suspending the air strikes was an essential
precondition to any discussion by the Security Council on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything short of that is impossible for the U.N. Security
Council to discuss any plan to solve the problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, concerned that the Chinese continue to refuse
his explanation that the bombing was a mistake, apologized for the
third time Monday. He sent a letter to the Chinese president, Jiang
Zemin, Sunday and publicly expressed regrets Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say to the Chinese people and to the leaders of
China, I apologize. I regret this,'' Clinton said in remarks before
a ceremony on youth and violence at the White House, after China
demanded that the United States apologize.
</P>
<P>
   China also announced on Monday that it was suspending high-level
military ties and a number of ongoing talks about issues the
administration sees at the heart of the American-Chinese
relationship, including human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing may also imperil negotiations over the entry of
China into the World Trade Organization. Anti-Western officials in
Beijing are using the embassy bombing to make their case against
economic concessions that Prime Minister Zhu Rongji offered during
his trip to Washington last month.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Chinese would benefit from entry into the trade
organization, the Clinton administration has based much of its
strategy for improved relations with China on extending economic
ties.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has based much of its strategy for improved
relations with China on extending economic ties. Administration
officials had hoped to finish negotiations on the trade deal in the
next few months, when they believed that the Senate would be more
amenable. Congress' indirect approval would be necessary for China
to enter the trade organization.
</P>
<P>
   But just as anti-Americanism is riding high in Beijing,
anti-Chinese anger is simmering in Congress, with senators angry
over reports of Chinese efforts to steal American satellite and
nuclear technology.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic, used the
crisis over the air strike to pile more pressure on the
administration by announcing a partial withdrawal of his forces
from Kosovo. The announcement did not state how many of his
estimated nearly 50,000 troops in Kosovo would be removed.
</P>
<P>
   There were differences in tone in the reaction of various
Clinton officials. The secretary of state, Madeleine Albright,
dismissed the announcement as a ``half-measure.'' Clinton said,
``I'm encouraged by any good word.'' But he insisted, like other
NATO officials who were cautious in their reaction, that other
terms must be met to reach a settlement. ``I think that the
conditions that we set out are the minimal ones to make this
work,'' the president added.
</P>
<P>
   As the administration worked at holding its Kosovo policy
together, the Russian envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin, arrived in
Beijing to talk to Chinese officials about Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, who is looked upon by the administration as one of
the best hopes for pushing a diplomatic solution with Milosevic,
changed his travel plans after the embassy strike and headed for
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said they assumed that because
the Russians were eager to play a predominant role in finding a
solution in Kosovo, Chernomyrdin would encourage the Chinese to be
reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the image of senior officials of two anti-NATO
countries, China and Russia, meeting over Kosovo, the place where
NATO's future hangs in the balance, was a little unsettling for
administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the officials said, they were confident
Chernomyrdin would ask the Chinese not to block a Security Council
resolution on the international security force.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Russians, the United Nations is an important venue,
and it's important for them to argue back home that they've brought
this issue back to the United Nations and out of the hands of
NATO,'' a Russia expert in the administration said. ``I think their
position to the Chinese is going to be: `Don't screw up the
possibility of a Security Council resolution. Let's try and get it
closer to our terms.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council became a pivotal part of the solution
in Kosovo last week when the seven richest industrial countries and
Russia agreed in Germany to a set of principles that would end the
war.
</P>
<P>
   Among the principles was an international security force for
which Russia and the seven countries said they would seek to get a
U.N. mandate.
</P>
<P>
   When NATO accidentally bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade,
the strategy for a Security Council mandate was put in jeopardy
because of China's veto power. Beijing illustrated how it could use
that veto earlier this year when it vetoed the continuation of a
U.N. force patrolling in Macedonia.

 WASHINGTON: in Macedonia.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said during the
weekend that he believed the Chinese would not exercise their veto
on the international force.
</P>
<P>
   Berger argued that the Chinese have been against the NATO
bombing since its start. ``Vetoing the force would put them in the
position of wanting to prolong the bombing and being against
peace,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   But others in the administration were not so sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hoping to get the ball rolling in New York at the
United Nations this week but that has all been put off,'' said a
State Department official. ``The question is how far has this set
us back and for how long. Whether the Chinese will calm down in a
week or two is not at all clear.'
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council met for two hours Monday to discuss the
bombing of the embassy but came to no conclusion on a Chinese draft
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese wanted the council to adopt a statement condemning
the bombing as a ``blatant encroachment on the sovereignty of a UN
member state.'' It asked NATO to ensure that ``all individuals
responsible for the incident be brought to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement was supported by Russia and Namibia and opposed by
five NATO members of the Council: the United States, Britain,
France, Canada and the Netherlands. All council statements, formal
or informal, require the agreement of all 15 members of the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the issue of Kosovo, the White House was faced with
repairing damage to the foundation of its relationship with
Beijing, one that Clinton has tried to cultivate as a legacy of his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Some administration officials took heart from the fact that the
policy of engagement and the two summit meetings by the two leaders
in the past two years meant that there was some depth from which to
work. But others said they were concerned that the anti-Americanism
unleashed by the embassy bombing portended for great difficulties
in restoring a semblance of trust.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the embassy also occurred at a trying time in
China's domestic politics _ when unemployment is soaring, the
conservatives are challenging the modernizers and the 10th
anniversary of the killings of hundreds of protesters in Tiananmen
Square looms next month.
</P>
<P>
   China's suspension of high-level military ties, and talks over
arms control, international security and human rights in protest of
the bombing meant that contacts between Washington and Beijing were
at their lowest since 1995 when relations plummeted over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The suspended meetings covered issues that the Clinton
Administration cares greatly about: accusations that China has
provided nuclear weapons or missile technology to Pakistan and
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   To show its pique, China called off a visit by the Boston
Symphony Orchestra and curtailed a visit by the German Chancellor,
Gerhard Schroeder. In another sign of irritation, when the White
House suggested that Clinton would like to call Zemin to express
his condolences, the Chinese said they would prefer that Clinton
send a letter.
</P>
<P>
   The president said in the letter that he looked forward to
speaking to him ``when he is ready,'' the White House spokesman,
Joe Lockhart said.

STRAWBERRY CHARGED IN FLORIDA; ARRAIGNMENT IN 2 WEEKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry's unfolding legal situation advanced to the
next level Monday when he was officially charged with possession of
cocaine and with soliciting prostitution, according to Pam Bondi,
the assistant state attorney in Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, who was arrested in Tampa on April 14 on the charges
of possessing three-tenths of a gram of cocaine and soliciting
prostitution from an undercover police officer, will be arraigned
on May 26.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old outfielder/designated hitter was in Tampa
working out at the Yankees' minor-league facility at the time he
was arrested. Strawberry has said that the cocaine was not his and
that he was joking with the female officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We officially filed criminal charges on him today,'' Bondi
said. ``Evidently, there were rumors going around that we were
going to drop the charges against him, and that's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Bondi said that if Strawberry pleads not guilty, the case will
go to trial. The solicitation charge is a second-degree misdemeanor
and carries a maximum sentence of 60 days in the county jail. The
cocaine possession charge is a third-degree felony and is
punishable by up to five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   While it is possible that Strawberry's lawyer could try to reach
a plea bargain agreement before the arraignment date, Bondi
declined to discuss the likelihood of a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Ficarrotta, Strawberry's lawyer, did not return a
telephone call left Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, who is on administrative leave from baseball and is
forbidden to work out with the Yankees or their minor-league teams
until his situation is resolved, was suspended for 60 days in 1995
after he tested positive for cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   This development further complicates Strawberry's chances of
returning to play this season because, regardless of his plea, it
increases the lengthy span that he has been away from the Yankees
and from playing baseball.

 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Abner Louima endured a grueling day of
cross-examination Monday by defense lawyers, who hammered away at
lies he had admitted to telling and conflicts in his various
accounts of his alleged beating and torture by four police officers
in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Louima, a 32-year-old Haitian immigrant, calmly responded by
attributing some of the conflicts to a memory clouded by medication
in the days after he was injured, and said it was ``my choice'' to
follow a supporter's advice to falsely tell a grand jury that one
officer said, ``This is Giuliani time,'' during the alleged
assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time I give evidence before the grand jury, I was under
medication and my memory, it wasn't clear like it is now,'' Louima
said. Louima said he did not remember what the medication was, but
a defense lawyer, Marvyn M. Kornberg, said records showed it was
Tylenol with codeine.
</P>
<P>
   Answering Kornberg, who had demanded to know ``why your
testimony is different today than it was when you testified for the
grand jury,'' Louima said, ``Now I am not really worried too much
about my health.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Louima suffered injuries to his rectum and
bladder after he was beaten and tortured after his arrest in a
street melee in 1997. Referring to those injuries, Louima said of
his answers at this trial: ``I don't have to carry a colostomy bag,
like I was thinking maybe I have to carry for the rest of my life.
I am more peaceful now. I have a better chance to think.''
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg responded sarcastically, ``You were peaceful enough to
commit perjury in the grand jury, weren't you?''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange came as Kornberg, who represents Officer Justin
Volpe, cited several falsehoods and a series of inconsistencies in
the accounts Louima gave to state and federal grand juries and
investigators and to the media in the months after he was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe and three other officers are on trial in the racially
charged case in federal court in Brooklyn. The four officers are
charged with violating Louima's civil rights by beating him in a
police car; Volpe and another officer are also accused of torturing
him at the 70th Precinct station house in the Flatbush section of
Brooklyn. The officers are white; Louima is black.
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyers cited several contradictions by Louima, such
as whether a second officer had restrained him in the restroom
while Volpe attacked him, whether Volpe or another officer put him
in a cell after the attack and how many officers allegedly kicked
him in the groin in the restroom.
</P>
<P>
   In a day of relentless questioning, Kornberg did not ask Louima
to respond to Kornberg's most explosive suggestion in the trial:
that Louima's injuries were not the result of Volpe ramming a stick
into his rectum, as the prosecution says, but by a consensual sex
act with another man before Louima encountered the officers.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg later declined to say why he had not asked Louima about
this. But there was no doubt that Louima would have denied the
suggestion, and Kornberg has already indicated, in his opening
arguments to the jury last week, that he intended to support the
suggestion through testimony by medical experts who would tell the
jury that a sex act was consistent was Louima's injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The other two officers on trial, Thomas Wiese and Thomas Bruder,
are charged with taking part with Volpe and Schwarz in beating
Louima in the police car. A fifth defendant, Sgt. Michael Bellomo,
is accused of trying to cover up the alleged beating in the police
car. All five defendants say the charges against them are untrue.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Kornberg and the other lawyers opted to focus largely
on discrepancies in Louima's accounts of the case.
</P>
<P>
   In the most inflammatory statement, Louima said one of the
officers had told him, ``This is Giuliani time! It's not Dinkins
time.'' Louima retracted that statement, which he had made to
reporters and to a state grand jury, after federal prosecutors took
over the case and presented it to a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   In the start of his testimony last week, Louima said the
brother-in-law of a nurse at Coney Island Hospital, where Louima
was being treated for his injuries, had advised him to make the
statement. Louima testified that the man told him, ``I must say it
to get the mayor's attention and also to get the attention of the
people responsible for justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning by another defense lawyer, Stephen C. Worth,
Louima acknowledged Monday that he had given more than one version
of that false statement.
</P>
<P>
   In a hospital news conference several days after he was
reportedly attacked, Louima said that an officer had made the
``Giuliani time'' remark in the station house restroom as he was
being tortured. But when he falsely reported that statement to a
grand jury at about the same time, Louima said an officer had made
the statement earlier, when he was being arrested in the
disturbance on a street outside a nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put it in a different place, in the bathroom rather than
on the street?'' asked Worth, who represents Officer Charles
Schwarz, charged with holding Louima down while Volpe shoved the
stick into his rectum and then his mouth in the station house
restroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Louima replied.
</P>
<P>
   But Louima refused to agree with Worth that the idea for the
``Giuliani time'' statement had come not from the nurse's
brother-in-law, but from lawyers who represented Louima at the
outset of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Worth said that those lawyers, who were replaced, had possibly
gotten the idea from the Rev. Al Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, sir,'' Louima responded.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Louima might face prosecution for his admitted
lies to the grand jury, a prosecutor, Loretta Lynch, declined to
comment. But it seems highly unlikely that the federal prosecutors
who have painted Louima as suffering grievously from what they have
called a depraved and traumatic assault would prosecute him for
perjury.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the only moment of drama in an otherwise long day of thrust
and parry by the defense lawyers and Louima, Worth asked if Louima
could identify Schwarz as the man who prosecutors say drove Louima
to the police station after his arrest and then held him down,
handcuffed, in the station's restroom while Volpe tormented him.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the witness box, Louima scrutinized the table where
all the defendants and nearly a dozen lawyers sat and said of
Schwarz, ``It looks like the driver, but I'm not sure.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first day of testimony last Thursday, Louima identified
Volpe as the man who tortured him in the station house restroom.
</P>
<P>
   Often Louima said he did not remember answers he had given in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think you can just say I don't remember every time you
don't want to give an unpleasant answer?'' Worth said.
</P>
<P>
   The cross-examination of Louima is due to continue Tuesday.

GUARANTEED-KILL RANCHES THRIVE, BUT OPPONENTS WANT THEM BANNED
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DEBRA WEST   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eleven years ago, having given up on venison farming, Jerry
Contento found a new and lucrative use for his sprawling property
in Homer, N.Y. He imported some big-game animals, fenced in nearly
300 acres and opened a ranch where, for a fee, hunters can shoot
Russian boar, Rocky Mountain elk, American buffalo or any of a
dozen species of exotic deer and sheep.
</P>
<P>
   He never dreamed how good business would be. Contento's ranch,
Cold Brook Hunts, is booked solid this year, and weekends are
reserved well into next year.
</P>
<P>
   Hunters are lured by a guaranteed kill, an abundance of well-fed
animals to choose from, a year-round open season and the
opportunity to use a gun, bow and arrow or a spear. Amenities
include an on-site butcher, a walk-in freezer and hunts that can be
tailored to most any skill level (easy for people who use
wheelchairs, challenging for those who prefer several days of
stalking).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like sending them on a golf outing,'' said Contento,
40. ``You can hunt hard all day, but in a controlled environment,
where you can take a break and have a nice lunch. It's time spent
out in the country. It's a vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   Animal-rights advocates have a less genteel description of it:
they call it ``canned hunting'' and say it is more slaughter than
hunt because the properties are fenced and the animals have no
chance to escape. They say that animals hunted on ranches are tame,
that they are bred and raised in captivity, fed on a regular basis
and have lost their instinct to flee humans.
</P>
<P>
   The animal-rights advocates, outraged by what they perceive as
cruelty to animals, have stepped up their efforts to pass state and
national legislation that would ban canned hunting. Last month, the
American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals began
broadcasting a graphic advertisement in New York depicting a
Corsican ram, repeatedly shot in the rump with arrows, quivering
and bleeding with no place to run. The footage was taken by an
undercover investigator at a hunting ranch in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen hunting ranch owners in New York and Pennsylvania
did not return repeated calls, and those who agreed to be
interviewed declined to allow a reporter to witness a hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven states, including New Jersey and Connecticut, have banned
canned hunting. In April, after months of debate, the Oregon
Department of Fish and Wildlife adopted a regulation banning canned
hunting. The regulation will effectively put the state's only
exotic hunting preserve, the 2,200-acre Clover Creek Ranch, out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, where the practice is relatively new (Contento, who
opened his hunting ranch in Cortland County in central New York in
1988, claims to be the first), hunting ranches are not regulated by
the state.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Environmental Conservation, which
oversees hunting, regulates only indigenous or endangered animals
and migratory birds, said Patrick Martin, a wildlife biologist.
</P>
<P>
   And the state Department of Agriculture and Markets has
jurisdiction over farm animals and tests for diseases on all
animals brought into state, but does not keep track of which
animals go to hunting preserves, said Pete Gregg, a department
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Federal legislation that would ban ranch hunting on properties
smaller than 1,000 acres has also been introduced, but it has a
slim chance of passage, said Wayne Pacelle, a senior vice president
for the Humane Society of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politically, Texas is the major impediment,'' Pacelle said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas had 637 hunting ranches in 1995, the last time a survey
was taken, said Ike C. Sugg, executive director of the Exotic
Wildlife Association, an industry group.
</P>
<P>
   Ranch hunting in Texas is a tradition that dates from the 1930s
and is an estimated $100 million-a-year business.

UNDATED: $100 million-a-year business.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In New York, a bill that would prohibit hunting non-native
species on ranches that are 10 acres or less and would prohibit
shooting caged, tied or hobbled animals, was passed by the state
Assembly in March. It is expected to be voted on this month in the
state Senate. The bill would make hunting on small ranches a
misdemeanor under the state's environmental conservation law,
punishable with a fine of up to $2,500 and a year in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who are promoting the legislation do not know whether
there are actually any hunting ranches in New York state small
enough to be affected by the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original draft was an out-and-out prohibition on canned
hunts,'' said Lisa B. Weisberg, vice president for governmental
affairs for the ASPCA. The legislation was drafted six years ago,
but efforts of the National Rifle Association, the property rights
movement and sportsmen's groups have whittled it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see now is legislation that's been through two dozen
drafts,'' Ms. Weisberg said. ``This is the best we could get.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the ASPCA and Humane Society estimate that there
are four or five big-game hunting ranches in New York, but there is
no way to know for sure. Contento, who advertises at the Web site
www.spinners.com/lopinto/issue2/coldbrook/html, says he thinks most
former venison farmers in the state have converted to ranch
hunting.
</P>
<P>
   One reason ranch hunting has grown in popularity is that the
hunting can take place all year long. Hunting in the wild is
restricted to short seasons so that animals are not disturbed when
they are mating or bearing young. For example, in New York deer can
be hunted only in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Pacelle of the Humane Society attributes the growth in ranch
hunting to a quest for stuffed animal trophies that hunters like to
display.
</P>
<P>
   But Donald E. Todd, a taxidermist in Carmel, in Putnam County,
has a roomful of trophy animals that people hired him to stuff and
then for one reason or another left behind. Among the orphans are
two Russian boars, two Spanish goats and a Corsican ram that people
paid good money to hunt on game ranches in Pennsylvania and New
Hampshire, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, by the time I'm finished stuffing them, the wife
has decided she doesn't want it in the house,'' Todd said. ``It's
funny, because they go to so much trouble. Some of them know
exactly what they want, how they want the head facing, where they
want it looking. They already know where they are going to hang
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Fiduccia, a writer and producer of cable television
programs on hunting and fishing, has hunted twice at the Lucky Star
Ranch, a hunting preserve in the Chaumont, N.Y., north of
Watertown.
</P>
<P>
   The first time, he took a 200-pound fallow deer; the second, a
500-pound European red stag, and neither time was easy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, it's not a walk in the park,'' Fiduccia said,
describing his hunt for the red stag. ``We were there four days. I
saw something on the second day, and it was moving too quickly to
get. On the fourth morning at the crack of dawn, I used my black
powder firearm and took him.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize how big an acre is, let alone 2,700
acres. You don't hunt on a ranch because it's easier. When you want
to hunt an exotic animal, there's no other option.''
</P>
<P>
   David J. Miller, 36, a landscaper from Newburgh, began hunting
when he was 18. He has killed a grizzly bear in Alaska, a black
bear in Maine and an assortment of big-game animals in several
states in between.
</P>
<P>
   He visited a 500-acre hunting ranch in Vermont where hunters can
shoot a razorback boar and pay by the pound (but they pay nothing
if they do not kill anything), and then he vowed never to hunt on
enclosed property again.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're on a regular hunt, you know you're going after
wild game,'' Miller said. ``In a preserve, you know everything is
fenced in. It's challenging, but it's like hunting in a shoe box.
There's a fence around it that's maybe 10 or 12 feet high. Once I
passed through the gate, it felt like going into Jurassic Park.''
</P>
<P>
   But the experience is largely determined by the size of the
property, said the Baron Josef von Kerckerinck, the owner of the
Lucky Star Ranch. Kerckerinck is from Germany, where deer have
traditionally been hunted in private parks. He imported European
fallow deer in 1978 and started venison farming. Four years ago, he
switched to hunting and since then has expanded his fenced preserve
from 700 acres to 2,700 acres. He keeps four species of deer, about
300 deer in all.
</P>
<P>
   He bristled at charges of cruelty by animal rights advocates:
``I believe the animals killed by a hunter's bullet dies a more
humane death than an animal killed in a slaughterhouse.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ And we thought the Lakers were the
dysfunctional family of the Western Conference playoffs, the team
of petulance and petty jealousy, of potential unrealized.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Instead of stealing Game 1 on the Lakers' home court, the
Rockets face the second game of the best-of-five series having
stolen Los Angeles' script.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets were cast as the wise old men, too seasoned to crack
under postseason pressure, much less bicker and lay blame after one
defeat. But they lost Game 1 by a point Sunday, and forward Scottie
Pippen stunned his coach and teammates by pointing fingers around
the locker room instead of at his own slip and turnover in the last
eight seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We win together and lose together,'' Rockets center Hakeem
Olajuwon said. ``Nobody can blame anybody else. It's our loss. We
had the opportunity to win. We didn't win. Now, we have to stick
together. Nobody is going to point fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen apparently didn't get the memo. He pointed in several
directions but mostly at Charles Barkley's decision to foul
Shaquille O'Neal with 28.4 seconds left and the Rockets holding a
two-point lead. O'Neal sank one of two free throws, and the Lakers
scored the decisive points on their next possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that foul we gave Shaq was a very smart play,''
Pippen said Sunday. ``You'd have thought that somebody might have
told somebody that you don't want to do that with a two-point lead
and 28 seconds left.''
</P>
<P>
   Told of Pippen's postgame comments, Olajuwon was aghast.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that? Scottie?'' Olajuwon said. ``If you want to point
fingers, you have to start with yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Under that ``cloud,'' as Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich
described it, the Rockets on Monday began preparations for Game 2.
But rebounding from a crushing defeat had become an increasingly
difficult challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets more than believed they gave away a Game 1 victory
on the road, a win that would have given them the home-court
advantage and tested the Lakers' chemistry, which is still
potentially fragile. On top of that, they now had to carry the
burden of Pippen's postgame analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a frustrating night last night,'' Barkley said. ``I
stayed in the room all night just disappointed, because everybody
is going to talk about how well Glen Rice played, how well Shaq and
everybody played. If we would have taken care of our business, we
would have won the game. We gave that game away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably easier to come back from a loss like that
because we know we played well. We're not going to point fingers at
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Reminded, however, that Pippen already had, Barkley would not be
drawn into the fray.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, whatever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed further on the subject, he reiterated, ``You heard me.
Whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   While not changing his stance Monday, Pippen did say he hadn't
intended to blame Barkley for the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't criticizing anyone,'' Pippen said. ``It wasn't a real
smart move at that time. We should have made them work. Once we
fouled, we gave them the two-for-one advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't criticizing or pointing fingers at anybody. We lost
the game together as a team. Everybody felt like they played
poorly. It wasn't any individual. It was a team loss. We have to
play better as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Signed to help the Rockets tap into his six-championship
experience _ a motivation that seemed somewhat ironic after his
first playoff game with them _ Pippen maintained the team's
maturity would help it now.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Experience) is great,'' he said. ``When you realize somebody
has to lose yesterday, we happened to be caught in that position.
We feel like we're going to win a game here. That was our mission
coming here _ to try to split and steal the home-court advantage.
We allowed one to get away from us. We have to move on. We're
mature enough to realize the game is behind us, and we have to
concentrate on the next game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of positives. Our game plan worked to
perfection. We have to go out and put it all together.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich expressed similar sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to accentuate the positive,'' he said. ``Everybody
forgets about the positive. Everybody starts talking about this one
little play and that little play. We did a lot of good things. I
talked about this before the game, the emotional ups and downs and
how we have to stay together and understand not to let the clouds
get us off track. It's not a desperate situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction to playing so well and losing, however, can go
either way. Reminding that Olajuwon was unstoppable early and
Barkley late, or that the rookie backcourt of Michael Dickerson and
Cuttino Mobley had solid games, might inspire confidence. Or the
wasting of such performances could increase the frustration.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets seemed willing to blame that frustration for
Pippen's postgame comments. The last time Pippen vented, wondering
aloud why the Rockets signed him after a game in Phoenix, he and
the team played well in the games that followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't take that stuff personally,'' guard Brent Price said
of Pippen's critique. ``The thing is for us to focus on beating the
other team and sticking together through the rough stuff.
Obviously, we're at a rough point when you play well, you have a
game plan in place, and it works (and you still lose). Other than
that one stretch in the second quarter, we controlled that game and
had it in our hands and let it slip away. Now, we're at that rough
point; we have to stick together.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, however, the frustration was still hanging around the
day after.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an opportunity,'' Olajuwon said. ``Once it is lost, it
can never be regained. We had that game. Until you play the whole
series, you never know how big it was _ unless we win the game
tomorrow.''

HEAT RESPONDS WITH DEFENSE AND ACCURACY TO EVEN SERIES
</HEADLINE>

 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Touche. The Miami Heat took back its turf and mended its
confidence Monday night, answering an embarrassing performance in
the opener of this series with an emphatic 83-73 victory over the
Knicks at Miami Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat evened the three-of-five-game series at 1-1, after
having lost Game 1 by 20 points on Saturday, and will try to
maintain its success at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday night in
Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat, which led the entire game, put on a performance more
reflective of its regular season. It closed off the open shots that
had been offered to Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell in Game 1,
and made the big baskets when it had to in order to hold off a late
rush by the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell and Houston combined to shoot 8 for 22 for 27 points,
while Patrick Ewing scored a team-high 16 points. The Heat was led
by Alonzo Mourning's 26 points. The Knicks, who trailed by as many
as 14 in the third quarter, were down by 63-55, entering the fourth
quarter. They had pulled off comebacks at this arena before,
including one from 20 points down two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   This time, they were down by 13 with under three minutes left in
the game. Not flustered, they pushed onward against the odds and
were able to cut the Heat's lead to 78-70 with 2 minutes 4 seconds
remaining on a driving layup from a relatively quiet Sprewell.
Unlike in Game 1, the Heat responded when Dan Majerle nailed a
3-pointer with 1:46 to go.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat shot 50.8 percent to the Knicks' 39.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This was exactly the turn of events Knicks' Coach Jeff Van Gundy
dreaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The natural NBA thing is to lose tonight, come in to the
locker room and say, `We're happy with the split,''' Van Gundy said
before the game. ``I've never understood that. You come down here
to win Game 1. And whatever the result is, you move on to Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're at this point of the year, and you're having to warn
people, it's not going to get through anyway. You hope your team is
mature enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing was as it had been in Game 1 from the start. The Heat
led, 46-35, at the half, had the hot hand in hitting 53.3 percent
from the field and played on the edge defensively to hold the
Knicks to 40 percent. Two days earlier, the Knicks held a 48-31
halftime lead and shot 58 percent, while the Heat hovered at 32
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The steam was still coming out the Heat's ears when Miami came
out of the half, and it built a 14-point lead midway through the
third quarter. The Knicks had to either get it together or give in
to the Heat's bully tactics.
</P>
<P>
   So they pushed back. With Ewing playing gallantly but hobbling,
with the Knicks' guards nearly invisible, the Knicks went to Larry
Johnson. And he scored 7 consecutive points, including a 3-pointer
when Terry Porter inexplicably left him on the wing with 3:07 left
in the third to cap a 12-5 run as the Knicks pulled to 57-50. The
Knicks absorbed a jumper from Porter but maintained their inspired
play.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Ward hit a 3-pointer, which was followed up by Houston
finally shaking Majerle for a jumper. The Knicks were clapping
their hands and pumping their fists when they cut the Heat's lead
to 59-55 with a minute left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat edged back out to a 63-55 lead entering the fourth
quarter. This was as it was supposed to be _ a tight, intense
battle.
</P>
<P>
   This was not like Game 1 at all. The ease with which shots
opened up for the Knicks in Game 1 closed as Majerle harassed
Houston, and Coach Pat Riley's attack dog, Keith Askins, put a few
doubts into Sprewell's thoughts about driving to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   The fluid motion of the Knicks' up-tempo offense in Game 1 came
to a grinding halt in the first half. Instead of making their first
five shots, they missed four of their first five and were 5 for 14
at one point in the first quarter. Instead of the Knicks watching
the Heat misfire, Mourning's 17 first-half points were complemented
by 9 from Jamal Mashburn and 7 from Clarence Weatherspoon.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Knicks were not converting the Heat's misses into
easy transition baskets. Suddenly, the Heat was awake and back to
defend any time the Knicks tried.
</P>
<P>
   To amplify the difference between Monday night's start and
Saturday's game, the Knicks watched as Sprewell and Houston
combined to shoot 2 for 11 in the first half. They began 11 for 16
in Game 1. The ball movement that opened up the Knicks in Game 1
vanished. The Knicks had just 1 assist in the first quarter and 5
in the first half, while the Heat totaled 13.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case so often this year, once the guards were
shut down, all offense flowed through Ewing. There was no other
choice. Although his Achilles' tendon was sore and aching _ which
was apparent as Mourning ducked around him for dunks _ Ewing was
the only thing going for the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Two days ago, there were cries of, Who needs Ewing? Can't he
just rebound, block shots and disappear into the background? Not
when no one else can get off a shot. Ewing scored 11 first-half
points on a 5-for-10 effort. The rest of the team went 7 for 23.
What a reversal by the Heat. This time, the Knicks were overwhelmed
by the Heat's intensity and taken aback by the onslaught of Heat
offense. In the second quarter, during a span of 1:41, the Knicks
picked up five fouls in a row.

HSBC TO PURCHASE REPUBLIC NEW YORK FOR $10.3 BILLION

 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ HSBC Holdings PLC announced Monday that it would
purchase the parent company of Republic National Bank of New York
for $10.3 billion cash, the biggest foreign takeover deal for an
American banking company.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of Republic New York Corp. and an affiliate by HSBC
_ an international banking group based in London with antecedents
in Hong Kong and Shanghai, China _ would double the size of HSBC's
private-banking business. It would also give HSBC the third-biggest
retail branch network in the New York City region, serving lower-
and middle-income customers with low-cost checking and free
automated teller machine services.
</P>
<P>
   Banking industry analysts said the deal largely reflected HSBC's
efforts to expand its highly profitable private-banking operations,
which serve very wealthy clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strategically it fits,'' said James Johnson, an analyst with
Credit Lyonnais Securities. ``It complements them in an area they
have been pushing _ wealth management.''
</P>
<P>
   But the deal would likely result in layoffs at Republic's New
York operations, to eliminate duplication with HSBC Bank USA, the
network of American branches formerly known as Marine Midland.
Analysts also said that the potential effects of the deal on
Republic's less affluent customers remained unclear, though they
could include new services and higher fees.
</P>
<P>
   Republic's sale would mark the end of independence for a banking
business founded more than three decades ago by Edmond Safra, a
Lebanese-born Jewish businessman who is regarded as an enduring
figure in the banking world.
</P>
<P>
   Safra, now 66, suffers these days from Parkinson's disease, a
neurological disorder, and there had been growing speculation in
recent days that he might sell. Republic's stock rose 14 percent on
Friday, and HSBC's purchase plan was reported on Sunday evening by
Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   Under the $72-a-share agreement, HSBC is buying Republic New
York Corp. and an affiliated company, Safra Republic Holdings SA,
the parent of banks that serve clients in havens like Switzerland,
Luxembourg and Monaco.
</P>
<P>
   HSBC has grown aggressively out of its roots in the colonial
Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. It is now a major competitor in the
business of managing money for the wealthy, a profitable business
that helps offset the risks in such other operations as loans to
emerging-market countries in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would surpass the previous record for a foreign
takeover of an American bank, the $10.1 billion purchase of Bankers
Trust by Deutsche Bank announced late last year. It also would be
HSBC's biggest purchase since it acquired Marine Midland Bank of
Britain for $6.1 billion in 1992, which led to the relocation of
its headquarters from Hong Kong to London.
</P>
<P>
   The combined operations of HSBC and Republic would have assets
of $554.4 billion and employ, as of the moment, 136,700 people.
HSBC said it would finance the purchase partly through borrowings
and a $3 billion stock sale.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Russell, HSBC's spokesman, said the move would maintain
the bank's avowed intention to balance its holdings in the
developed world with investment in emerging markets. And, he said,
``it gives us an extra million customers in the world's biggest
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal requires regulatory approval in Britain, the United
States, Hong Kong and elsewhere, but Russell said HSBC hoped to
complete it by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   HSBC had previously announced that it would list its shares for
trading in the United States, and there has since been speculation
that it planned a big American acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   After rising Friday on takeover speculation, Republic shares
fell $1.9375, to $68.0625, in New York on Monday. Safra Republic
shares, traded in Luxembourg, soared 17.5 euros, to close at 66
euros. Both HSBC Holdings and HSBC's separate class A shares fell
more than 2 percent here.
</P>
<P>
   By purchasing Safra Republic Holdings, HSBC will acquire 30,000
international clients in high-margin private banking that generally
caters to people with more than $1 million in liquid investment
funds. The affiliate has 44 offices holding client funds that total
$56.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they want to capture is an ever growing number of
millionaires in Asia and, to some extent, in Latin America,'' said
Simon Samuels, a banking analyst at Salomon Smith Barney here.
Wealth management, he said, was also seen as ``the flavor of the
next century'' because of projections that, with the ever shrinking
ability of governments to provide pensions, there would be a
corresponding boom in private savings investment by individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The acquisitions we have announced today will bring together
two complementary private banking franchises,'' said HSBC's
chairman, John Bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the stroke of a pen it doubles the size of our consumer
banking operations in the United States and it doubles the size of
our private banking business around the world.''

APPLE INTRODUCES NEW POWERBOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ A resurgent Apple Computer introduced a new,
lighter Powerbook Monday that the company maintained would permit
it to retain its performance lead over the larger Intel-based
computing world.
</P>
<P>
   The company's co-founder and interim chief executive, Steven
Jobs, announced two new models at the company's annual development
conference, which began here Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The machines, which are priced at $2,499 and $3,499, are both
built around a PowerPC microprocessor that employs the advanced
copper-based chip technology developed by IBM Corp., which
significantly reduces the power requirements and thus increases
battery life.
</P>
<P>
   The new machines, which have 333-megahertz and 400-megahertz
processors, are about 20 percent thinner than Apple's current line
of G3 Powerbooks. However, at 5.9 pounds they are still heavier
than the ultralight Windows-compatible notebooks, typically around
four pounds or less, from companies like Sony, Toshiba, Sharp and
IBM.
</P>
<P>
   On the retail computing front, Jobs said the iMac consumer line
of computers would soon be carried by more than 800 Sears, Roebuck
stores. That will give Apple a distribution channel into the
no-computer consumer world, which it needs following a decision
last month by the Best Buy chain to stop carrying the iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs was also vague about the announcement date of the company's
long-rumored ``consumer portable,'' with which Apple is planning to
duplicate the company's iMac strategy in the low-end retail
computing arena. While Apple's sales have increased significantly
in the last year, it is still under pressure from the Intel world,
where prices of Intel's own processors and those of competitors
like Advanced Micro Devices have continued to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, however, pricing pressure did not appear to be a
concern. Jobs at one point in a two-hour presentation told the
audience of 2,500 Apple developers that the company had beaten the
current leader in the Intel world, Dell Computer, on maintaining
minimum inventories in the last three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple has become the most operations-efficient computer
company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the morning session was devoted to the company's
software strategy, and Jobs said that for the first time in years
the company now had a consistent message.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to introduce an enhanced version of its
Sherlock Internet search technology later this year. The software
will enable Macintosh users to query multiple shopping sites or to
gather other kinds of information.
</P>
<P>
   Apple announced that it was shipping a new update to its
operating system, version 8.6, and Jobs demonstrated two future
versions, one code-named Sonata and another that will be released
as Mac OS X sometime early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the features of Mac OS X, including a new windowing
system dubbed Quartz and some new interface features, are
reminiscent of Jobs' Next software, which received high technical
marks but failed in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence that Apple has made significant progress in wooing
software developers, Jobs said that Dragon Systems Inc., publisher
of a popular speech recognition system, would once again produce a
version for the Macintosh. Janet Baker, the company's chief
executive, said the company would release its software for the
Macintosh early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs went to some lengths Monday to thank the developers for
standing by the company during several rough years. He said that
the new Apple Computer had shaken off the software doldrums and
noted that in the last year since the introduction of the iMac,
software companies had announced some 3,100 new applications for
the Macintosh.

KELLER LOSES BID TO GET BACK ON U.S. SOCCER TEAM
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Debbie Keller, the No. 2 scorer on the United States women's
soccer team last year, lost an arbitration decision Monday in which
she sought reinstatement to the team.
</P>
<P>
   Keller, 23, had contended that she was excluded by the national
team in its preparations for the Women's World Cup because she had
filed a sexual harassment suit last year against Anson Dorrance,
the women's soccer coach at the University of North Carolina and a
former coach of the women's national team.
</P>
<P>
   After hearings in Chicago last week, however, three lawyers
representing the American Arbitration Association ruled Monday that
the United States soccer federation had committed no wrongdoing in
not selecting Keller to participate in the six-month training camp
that began in January in preparation for next month's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The federation maintained that she was not invited to the camp
for soccer-related reasons, not for retaliatory reasons. The
20-woman roster will be named next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this matter behind us, our players, coaches and
administrative staff can continue to focus on the most important
task at hand, which is winning the 1999 Women's World Cup,'' said
Hank Steinbrecher, secretary-general of the federation.
</P>
<P>
   Keller was invited to the camp for a week in March after scoring
14 goals for the team last year. She filed the suit against
Dorrance last August in federal court in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was unprecedented by the coaching staff, not to invite
the No. 2 scorer from the team to the residency camp, not to offer
her even a chance to get on the World Cup team,'' said Dane
Butswinkas, a Washington lawyer who represented Keller at the
arbitration hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit had caused tension among national team players, a
number of whom, like Keller, played for Dorrance at North Carolina
and who remain fiercely loyal to their former coach. Tracy Ducar, a
backup goalie with the national team and a North Carolina
assistant, was also a defendant in the Federal lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Tony DiCicco, now the head coach of the national team, formerly
served as an assistant to Dorrance on the national team. In a
letter he wrote Keller last fall, DiCicco praised her intelligence
and said she played with a strong sense of purpose, but said he was
concerned that she had reached ``close to your full potential.'' He
also said there were ``chemistry issues,'' mentioning the lawsuit
and ``underlying issues with other players on the team.'' He did
not name those issues.
</P>
<P>
   Butswinkas declined to say whether Keller would continue her
effort to regain a spot on the team. Her options include an appeal
of Monday's ruling and seeking relief under federal
antidiscrimination statutes. &QL;

 SIXTH SENSE FOR THE NEW YIELDS SOMETHING OLD: THE CAFTAN   (jw) 
 By CATHY HORYN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just because Muriel Brandolini lives in an elegant
brownstone in the East 80s and is married to an Italian banker _
``a scion,'' Vogue called him _ is no reason to think that she has
everything. Before Mrs. Brandolini became a much-in-demand
decorator, she was a fashion stylist, and before that she was a
Vietnamese immigrant selling sheets at Descamps in Manhattan. Plain
old, run-of-the-mill cotton is to the former Muriel Phan-van-Thiet
what a radish was to Scarlett O'Hara.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God, there's no messing around with her,'' said Marian
McEvoy, the editor in chief of Elle Decor. ``She's iron-willed _
and funny.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Mrs. Brandolini's equally audacious decorating style,
which favors eccentric combinations of European and Far Eastern
furnishings all surrounded by yards of lurid Indian pastel prints,
it might be called Upper East Side Souk. ``It's sort of violent,
actually,'' said Andrea Botta, a friend and client.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, while in India to finesse the details of her
second collection of home fabrics, Mrs. Brandolini had a bright
idea. She was in a textile factory in Jaipur, poring over the
tissue-thin voiles _ rajah pinks, wading-pool blues _ when it
occurred to her that they would make great caftans. ``I loved the
fabrics so much I wanted to wear them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Caftans are hardly new. They've been around, at least in
Christian times, since the dawn of the Byzantine era, when
fashionable Romans took up the ankle-length Persian style. They're
loose-fitting garments generally made of semi-transparent fabric,
like cotton voile, and they have a long and glamorous association
with the world's chic watering holes, from Palm Beach to Marrakech,
wherever the jet set has landed.
</P>
<P>
   Such, in brief, is the story of how an East Side decorator took
an idea and ran with it _ straight to Neiman Marcus and Barneys New
York, which will have her vivid block-print caftans on sale in
early June for $265. (Because caftans are traditionally sheer, Mrs.
Brandolini has also designed loose floor-length coats in
contrasting prints).
</P>
<P>
   The funny part is, the people in Jaipur initially tried to put
her off, saying they couldn't possibly produce samples in the week
or so before she left.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Brandolini smiled at the memory. ``I said, `No, you don't
understand,' '' she recalled. `` `They have to be in stores in
June. I want them now, now, now!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Since her days as a stylist for Italian Vogue and other
farsighted magazines, Mrs. Brandolini, the daughter of a Vietnamese
lawyer and a French-Venezuelan pianist, has demonstrated a sixth
sense for the new. ``She's always been at the top of the crest of
the wave,'' said Carlos Souza, Valentino's longtime press aide in
Rome. But now her timing seems all the more perfect.
</P>
<P>
   At the Paris haute couture collections in January, Oscar de la
Renta showed a creamy white caftan of pashmina cashmere for Balmain
that was embroidered with Indian paisley. Next to some of the more
overblown concoctions of the week, that simple caftan looked
utterly modern. ``Although it was very, very expensive, it sold
well,'' de la Renta said. About eight women, mostly from the
designer's American retinue, ordered it (at $15,000).
</P>
<P>
   ``The caftan is a very luxurious way of dressing when you're at
home and relaxing with friends,'' de la Renta said, adding that he
has always included a couple of styles in his own collections, and
that although stores seldom order them, they are among the top
sellers at trunk shows.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, Sotheby's plans to auction caftans worn by the
American heiress Barbara Hutton in her home in Tangier. They were
made for her in traditional Moroccan silks by the French houses of
Lanvin and Givenchy. ``I think part of their appeal is the
arts-and-crafts look that is coming back, and that we want to look
less uniform,'' said Tiffany Dubin, the director of Sotheby's
fashion sales. ``That's Muriel's style.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's maybe a little bit of a 1970s thing,'' said Judy
Collinson, Barneys general merchandising manager. ``It's all
related to lounging and luxury.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Of course, some of the enduring fashion images of the late 1960s
are of Yves Saint Laurent lounging in white Moroccan caftans in his
home in Marrakech. The intimation that there was little under that
gauzy shroud was part of its erotic appeal. And who among the
glamorous and jet-propelled didn't wear one? Babe Paley, Mirella
Agnelli, Chessy Rayner, Mica Ertegun. Diana Vreeland, the high
priestess of fashion, wore them like nothing. ``It was Diana who
introduced me to the caftan life,'' de la Renta said. ``Every
collection I would make one for her, so she had a lot of my
caftans.''
</P>
<P>
   Boaz Mazor, executive at large for Oscar de la Renta, recalled
an evening at Mrs. Vreeland's apartment when she came out in a
white caftan over a red leotard. ``You could see all of her,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Brandolini, who is 39, had to look no further for
inspiration than her own chic mother-in-law, Cristiana Brandolini,
a legendary beauty and a sister of Gianni Agnelli, the Fiat tycoon.
``Her style of living has refined my eye _ just to watch and live
with her in her surroundings,'' Mrs. Brandolini said one morning
last week as her 3-year-old daughter, Filippa, played next to her.
(She also has a son, Brando, who is 6.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' she said, ``Cristiana has a greenhouse in the
countryside where all the furniture is slipcovered in blue-jean
fabric. Who would think of that?'' Mrs. Brandolini laughed. ``And
she wears caftans all the time. In Venice, at Palazzo Brandolini,
she wears them with maybe flat shoes and just some beads. She's
superchic.''
</P>
<P>
   From her home in Switzerland, Countess Brandolini said by phone,
``It's such an easy thing to wear.'' She sounded a little bemused
at the attention being paid to something that is, after all, almost
an anti-fashion garment. ``You can wear a caftan at home or to the
beach or, in the winter, with a sweater. I think it's a good moment
to wear it again because it's more modern to have your own style.''
</P>
<P>
   In her town house, with its flea-market lamps, Venetian shades,
and chaotic mix of pattern and color, Muriel Brandolini projects
some of the bravura for which she is known as a decorator, a flair
that has won her young clients like Christopher and Pia Getty and
Ms. Getty's sister and brother-in-law Marie-Chantal and Crown
Prince Pavlos of Greece, for whom Mrs. Brandolini recently
completed a sleek apartment in mostly navy, brown and cream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Muriel's style is a bit orgasmic,'' Botta, her first client,
said with a laugh. ``When she starts running, she runs.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if people found it hard to say no to her, Mrs.
Brandolini thought for a minute, as if the question were a
criticism. Then she flicked aside a strand of hair and said, ``My
husband would say I don't take no for an answer.'' Yet even she
seemed to marvel at the way she seized on her naive caftans and got
them swiftly under the noses of buyers, all in a matter of weeks
after returning from India.
</P>
<P>
   With four decorating projects in the works and plans to expand
her line of fabrics, with pillows and possibly table linens, Mrs.
Brandolini won't guess whether she will design more clothes in the
future except to say it's all part of a piece _ and maybe, who
knows, it might lead to a range of products sold together in
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Flipping through a stack of the fabrics which had inspired her
caftans, she said, with obvious understatement, ``It's beautiful in
abundance.''

IN LAS VEGAS, SHOPPING, TOO, CAN BE A HIGH-STAKES PASTIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANNE-MARIE SCHIRO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS, Nev. _ It's easy to drop a bundle in Las Vegas
without ever hitting the slot machines or the baccarat table. The
other high-stakes game in town is shopping. Although the Fashion
Show Mall has been around since 1981 with stores like Neiman Marcus
adding glamour to the usual mall mix, the ante has been raised
recently by high-fashion boutiques that have opened in the new
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Like hard-core gamblers who rarely take time to sleep, serious
shoppers can spend their money from 10 a.m. to midnight, 365 days a
year.
</P>
<P>
   A woman staying at Bellagio or Caesars Palace _ the two hotels
with the greatest number of shops _ could buy designer sportswear,
evening dresses, lingerie, shoes, handbags and real jewels without
ever leaving her hotel. A man's choices are more limited.
</P>
<P>
   The concentration at the seven-month-old Bellagio is on high-end
shops like Fred Leighton, Giorgio Armani, Chanel, Prada and
Tiffany's, while Caesars caters to nickel bettors as well as high
rollers, with shops ranging from Guess to Versace and Louis
Vuitton.
</P>
<P>
   How well the merchants are doing is questionable. Andrew
Hagopian, the director of retail stores at Bellagio, said the
hotel's stores were off to a better-than-expected start. But on a
recent weekend, the only ones that seemed busy were Chanel,
Tiffany's and Prada.
</P>
<P>
   At Caesars Palace, there were crowds walking through the
shopping area but few people in most of the boutiques.
</P>
<P>
   Via Bellagio, as the main shopping arcade in the Bellagio is
called, has a glass ceiling inspired by the Galleria in Milan,
potted palm trees and Italianate mosaic-tile floors. Sunlight
streams down during the day, creating the feeling of being in an
elegant European city. Each leased boutique has its own distinctive
decor, so regular shoppers feel at home.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Chow's sleek design is a highlight of Armani's spacious
store. Hermes features warm woods (and currently, for $2,025, a
man's bicycle in black with a tan leather seat). Prada has the pale
celadon walls and cutout figures in the window that have become its
signatures (and this spring's mirror-decorated clothes).
</P>
<P>
   The black and beige Gucci shop carries only accessories, mainly
bags; clothing is sold at the larger store in Caesars Palace.
Tiffany's looks like Tiffany's and offers china, glassware and
silver as well as jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Bellagio also runs several shops of its own, including Bellagio
Collections, with women's clothing by designers like Donna Karan,
Calvin Klein and Richard Tyler; a lingerie store that carries La
Perla and Fernando Sanchez, and a shoe store with Andrea Pfister,
Robert Clergerie and Stuart Weitzman.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a men's store named D. Fine with Italian-made
clothing and accessories ranging from Brioni suits to $450 handmade
shirts to $20,000 crocodile sport jackets.
</P>
<P>
   No crocodile jackets have been sold yet, but six ostrich jackets
at $13,000 have been snapped up, the store said. To paraphrase
Cindy Adams, only in Las Vegas, kids, only in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The Forum Shops at Caesars meander under a ceiling that changes
from day to night skies as strollers pass Roman statuary, marble
columns, a gurgling fountain with Neptune reigning over winged
horses, and the occasional simulated volcanic eruption.
</P>
<P>
   Among the shops are Coach, Christian Dior Accessories, Escada,
Shaun Stein (which carries Dolce &AMP; Gabbana, Jean Paul Gaultier and
Moschino), Ferragamo, Fendi, Hugo Boss and Victoria's Secret.
</P>
<P>
   The newest hotel in town is the Venetian, which opened earlier
this month with its re-creation of the Piazza San Marco and
miniature Grand Canal and a roster of more than 50 shops scheduled
to open later, including Ann Taylor, Sephora, Jimmy Choo and Banana
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Still under construction is the Paris Hotel, with copies of the
Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe in front and, no doubt, more
shops.
</P>
<P>
   The Fashion Show Mall, with 140 small shops and five large
anchors, attracts more local people than tourists. ``We're quite
sedate, like a normal mall,'' said Terri Monsour, the general
manager of the mall's Neiman Marcus store. ``We have travertine
marble but no volcanos and no roller coasters.''

NEW ENERGY FOR A NEW YORK BANK 
</HEADLINE>
  (With HSBC-REPUBLIC) 
(mk) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ HSBC Holdings PLC's agreement to buy Republic New
York Corp. may mean that one of New York's slowest-moving consumer
banks gets a much-needed shot in the arm.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition also means that a significant number of Republic
employees are likely to be laid off, although the bank said Monday
that it was too early to say how many layoffs there will be.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Republic said it would eliminate about 560 jobs, or
nearly 10 percent of its 5,800-member work force. The bank said
that 384 of those job cuts would be layoffs. Analysts said Monday
that more layoffs were likely as the two banks consolidated
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer banking has been something of an orphan at Republic, a
bank best known for inhabiting more exotic financial realms like
securities and currency trading and international private banking.
Because Republic's consumer business has not been nearly as
profitable as competitors' consumer units, HSBC is likely to beef
up Republic's recent efforts to sell higher-fee products at the
branches _ moves that might come as a shock to Republic's 800,000
customers in New York state who have grown accustomed to such
things as no-fee automated teller machines. HSBC declined to
comment on its fee plans.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Republic has the eighth-largest consumer banking
business in New York state, with about $13.6 billion in deposits
statewide, according to Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods, the research firm.
Most of Republic's 109 branches are concentrated in New York City's
five boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   HSBC, which recently renamed its American subsidiary from Marine
Midland Bank to HSBC Bank USA and employs 9,500 people here, is the
fifth-largest consumer bank in New York state, with some $21.3
billion in deposits. Most of its 405 branches are in upstate New
York, in areas like Rochester and Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, the banks would rank No. 3 in New York state in terms
of deposits, behind Chase Manhattan and Citigroup, according to
Keefe, Bruyette. In New York City, the combined bank would be the
fourth largest in terms of deposits and the third largest in
branches.
</P>
<P>
   Although the combined bank's 149 New York City branches seem
like an impressive number, ranking behind Chase's 363 and
Citigroup's 162, the bank would lag far behind in deposits. Chase
has $78.45 billion worth of deposits in New York City, Citigroup
has $34.25 billion, and a combination of HSBC and Republic would
have $17.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say it's cutting edge,'' said Marni Pont O'Doherty,
a Keefe, Bruyette analyst, referring to Republic's consumer
operation. ``Republic has run it in a sort of stodgy fashion, and
HSBC will probably be able to add some dynamism.''
</P>
<P>
   HSBC has one of banking's best-regarded management teams. Its
expected overhaul of Republic's New York City consumer-banking
business is likely to include greater lending, more aggressive
marketing and higher fees.
</P>
<P>
   Republic once advertised its low fees and has not joined New
York banks like Citigroup and Chase Manhattan in the rush to charge
for services like the use of automated teller machines. But Ms.
O'Doherty and other analysts noted that other banks offered better
bargains on low-fee checking accounts and that Republic no longer
used low fees as part of its marketing strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their metropolitan New York retail strategy was one of
acquiring old-line savings banks, which they haven't transformed,''
said Gerard Cassidy, an analyst with Tucker Cleary Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Republic once tried to foster a sense of homey service
in its consumer business, including piano players and free
doughnuts in branches _ quaint touches that have disappeared in
recent years.

 &HT;    Florida `inviting' for bioterrorism attack, experts warn
 &HT;    By Sanjay Bhatt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Imagine hearing a day after shopping at
the mall that terrorists have exposed 9,000 shoppers to deadly
anthrax using the mall's air conditioning system.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the week, 855 shoppers are dead. Another 4,950 are
hospitalized. FBI agents close the mall indefinitely, bankrupting
scores of businesses.
</P>
<P>
   This devastating attack, so simple in its execution, is just one
scenario military experts have developed using computer models.
</P>
<P>
   The inclination is to call it far-fetched. But because
biological weapons are remarkably cheap, easy to make and easy to
use, it could happen. In fact, the state's assistant health officer
calls an attack in Florida ``likely'' within the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're an invitation for a bioterrorism event, no question,''
Dr. Leslie Beitsch said Friday in Tampa at the first
state-sponsored conference on the medical response to bioterrorism
and weapons of mass destruction. Bioterrorism means the use of
toxins and microbiological agents, such as anthrax bacterium, to
destroy people, plants or animals in order to achieve political
goals.
</P>
<P>
   Florida is more attractive to terrorists than other states,
Beitsch said, because of its proximity to Cuba, which is considered
a safe haven for terrorists; porous borders that allow an influx of
undocumented migrant workers; a semi-tropical climate good for
breeding mosquitoes that can transmit disease; and numerous tourist
attractions, such as Walt Disney World, that would make it possible
to harm many people at once.
</P>
<P>
   And government statistics show the number of terrorist incidents
directed at Americans is at an all-time high, said Bernard
Schechterman, a University of Miami professor and coauthor of the
recently published Annual Editions: Violence and Terrorism, 99/00.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the government is taking threats to use biological
and chemical weapons more seriously than ever: President Clinton
proposes spending more than $1 billion next year, most of it for
research. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services would
get $230 million, a 46 percent increase over spending this year, to
improve surveillance, stockpile medicine, develop treatments and
get hospitals and public health workers ready to work together.
</P>
<P>
   That means money for Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast.
Rescue workers are receiving awareness training. Palm Beach County
Fire Rescue recently received a $250,000 grant from the Justice
Department to buy special equipment to protect rescue workers and
decontaminate victims of biological or chemical attacks.
</P>
<P>
   And if the state receives a $2.5 million grant, it would upgrade
the health department's West Palm Beach laboratory so technicians
can detect some germs more quickly, improving survival odds for
local victims. Some grant money also would pay for computer systems
to speed up communications with county health departments and
private physicians, Beitsch said.
</P>
<P>
   But last week's two-day conference in Tampa indicates local
planning for bioterrorism has barely begun, particularly in rural
counties that don't get much federal money. Palm Beach and Martin
County officials say they've educated some health and rescue
workers, but they're still trying to get others especially hospital
administrators and emergency room staff to discuss how to deal with
something many people consider too remote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we have those capabilities right now,'' said Al
Sierra, a Palm Beach County Fire Rescue officer. While rescue
workers and the county's two trauma hospitals have trained for mass
casualty events, such as hurricanes or plane crashes, Sierra said
there's been no planning for dealing with hundreds, maybe
thousands, of victims from biological or chemical attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't all sat at the table to do a biological exercise,''
said Valerie Gryniuk, director of the Martin County Health
Department. ``This (conference) is designed to bring greater
awareness because you need to know where your community is with
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, when a speaker asked how many hospital
administrators were among some 200 people at the conference, no one
raised a hand. One Veterans Administration hospital official did
attend, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, I have never been able to get (through) to
hospital administrators,'' said Dr. L. W. Stringer, an emergency
medical services director in Winston-Salem, N.C., who heads the
East Coast's federal special operations response team. With
hospitals' tight budgets and a national shortage of nurses, ``it's
going to be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The root of the problem: Biological weapons can be more deadly
because they can infect their victims and lie dormant for days or
months before causing health problems. So perpetrators can escape
quietly. Victims can infect others. And if the weapon is
genetically engineered, it could be resistant to normal treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Smallpox is the most worrisome threat. The highly contagious
virus lies silent for more than a week before causing pustules to
appear all over its victim's body and can last for a month. It
kills one in four adults and four of five young children.
</P>
<P>
   People are no longer routinely vaccinated against smallpox
because public health workers eradicated it worldwide in 1979. As a
result, many doctors have never seen a smallpox patient.
</P>
<P>
   Only the United States and Russia are known to have the virus,
but health experts say if those stocks were obtained and used by a
terrorist, one incident could infect 40 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Anthrax is considered the other big threat: Forty thousand
clusters of the bacteria can fit on the head of a pin. Though
infected people can't spread it, it is fatal unless treated
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people should be going paranoid,'' Gryniuk said.
``They need to be aware, they need to take threats seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Local health workers already have seen hoaxes. Last month, a
Lake Worth law firm received a package containing a white powder
that police worried might be anthrax. The FBI said lab tests showed
the powder isn't anthrax, but have not determined what it is.
</P>
<P>
   And last year, a Stuart doctor's office received a package
thought to contain Ebola virus, a highly contagious virus that
causes massive internal bleeding. It turned out to be a false
alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Only one successful U.S. bioterrorist attack has been
documented: In 1984, the Rajneeshees cult used bacteria to poison
10 restaurants' salad bars in the Oregon town of The Dalles to
reduce voter turnout for an election. At least 750 people got sick.
A string of non-biological terrorist attacks in the '90s the World
Trade Center bombing, a nerve gas attack in Tokyo's subway and the
Oklahoma City bombing have made government officials jittery and
spurred increases in federal spending. In 1994, Congress made it
illegal to unlawfully possess biological or chemical agents that
could be used as weapons of mass destruction and to make threats to
use such weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Planners are particularly concerned about how unprepared the
nation's hospitals are.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County hospitals already are overwhelmed during the
tourism season, and county officials have been discussing how to
divert less sick patients to less crowded hospitals. But diversion
policies may not work in a biological attack because historically
more than half of an attack's victims arrive on their own and are
contaminated, Stringer said.
</P>
<P>
   He criticized hospital administrators for not addressing
inadequacies in decontamination facilities, controlling how many
patients move from one hospital room to the next, supplies of drugs
like atropine, and staff training.
</P>
<P>
   Inexperienced emergency room staff will face unique problems:
How will they get hundreds of victims to disrobe en masse in a
parking lot? How will they quarantine these witnesses to a crime
and preserve their clothing, considered evidence?
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County is trying to prevent hospitals from being
overwhelmed: Last month, county commissioners approved spending
$68,000 for supplies and equipment for two mobile hospitals. The
units can provide full hospital care to hundreds of patients for
six to 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   But even with awareness, equipment and planning, rescue workers
are sure they won't be able to anticipate everything. ``Preparation
for something like that is always something you need to improve
upon,'' said Mike Arena, a Palm Beach County Fire Rescue battalion
chief.

PENTAGON ADMITS ITS MAPS OF BELGRADE ARE OUT OF DATE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In confusing the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade for a
Yugoslav arms agency, the CIA relied on old maps and educated
guesses rather than on first-hand information, government officials
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen attributed the bombing to
``institutional error'' and announced corrective measures. He said
he hoped such steps would shore up the procedures used to identify
targets and prevent incidents like the bombing of the embassy on
Friday, which killed three people and wounded 20.
</P>
<P>
   Among the measures he outlined were improved procedures for
gathering information about targets, including new methods to
update maps. Instead of sometimes identifying targets only through
second-hand information, intelligence analysts will be required to
try to verify possible targets with people who are familiar with
specific areas of a city.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary also said two Pentagon agencies would quickly set
up new procedures to update critical databases on buildings that
must not be hit, like embassies, mosques, churches, schools and
hospitals. This is important because the geographic coordinates of
targets are checked against the databases to try to avoid civilian
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Chinese Embassy, the Pentagon map was drawn
in 1992, updated in 1997 and reviewed last year, but it still did
not include the current site of the embassy and left the building
there unmarked, officials said. The new embassy was built in 1996;
the maps still had the embassy in its former location, American
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of those maps indicated that it was the Chinese Embassy
that was being targeted,'' Cohen said after briefing President
Clinton. ``It was not a human error or mechanical error _ it was an
institutional error.''
</P>
<P>
   The intended target, the headquarters of a Yugoslav arms agency,
is about 200 yards south of the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the new review, all addresses for all embassies are
being checked, intelligence officials said. From now on, Cohen
said, the State Department will tell intelligence agencies when
foreign embassies move or when new ones are built.
</P>
<P>
   But senior intelligence officials said that in the rush of war,
they could not guarantee such an accident would not occur again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This target was vetted and worked against the databases,'' a
senior intelligence official said, ``but there is always a
compromise between time and speed, and how far you want to check
one more map, one more source, and things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence officials said it is impossible to develop a
fail-safe system, especially because analysts are being stretched
thin by demands to review targets in potential hot spots from the
Balkans and Persian Gulf to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``A worldwide database, even a database for a city the size of
Belgrade or a country the size of Yugoslavia, is a daunting
challenge to maintain, current and accurate,'' the intelligence
official said. ``We can only do the best we can. And we can't, you
know, guarantee that something like this will not happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Pentagon agency that drew up the map of Belgrade,
the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, is the same one that
prepared the maps for the Marine Corps jet that struck a ski-lift
cable last year near Aviano, Italy. Defense lawyers contended that
the crew was not to blame because the cable did not appear on the
Pentagon map.
</P>
<P>
   If failing to locate the Chinese Embassy was the first mistake,
misidentifying the intended target, the Yugoslav Federal
Directorate of Supply and Procurement, was the second.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence officials said Monday that they had determined the
street address of the arms headquarters, No. 2 Boulevard of the
Arts, and then sought to match it on the out-of-date maps using the
addresses of other sites in the same area. But the target was put
on NATO's bombing list after the air war began on March 24, after
which the United States Embassy in Belgrade closed, so no American
official on the ground could verify the site.
</P>
<P>
   An American official said no one considered using a Yugoslav to
check, and no one considered checking the planned targets with the
American officials who had just left the city.
</P>
<P>
   So in essence, officials said Monday, it was bombing by
deduction. ``Because this extrapolation process is less than
precise, that's why you have a system that has multiple checks,
both within the CIA, within the intelligence community'' and within
the Department of Defense, a senior intelligence official said.
</P>
<P>
   But after the backup systems failed in this case, one
intelligence official acknowledged that from now on there will be
an ``iron-clad requirement'' to review targets with people who have
with first-hand knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   That step may help solve the problem of identifying buildings on
the ground. But on airborne reconnaissance photographs used to
derive the geographic coordinates that were plugged into satellite
guidance systems for the bombs, officials said Monday, there were
similarities between the embassy and the arms agency.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, intelligence experts said, a decision made in
1996 may have contributed to the problem of reading such
photographs: The CIA photographic intelligence center, which
analyzes reconnaissance photographs, was folded into the Pentagon's
mapping agency, prompting many of the government's most experienced
photographic analysts to leave.

U.S. PLANS AIRDROPS TO REFUGEES INSIDE KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States is planning to begin dropping
supplies to the half-million Albanians forced from their homes and
hiding in the Kosovo hills with little food or medicine, the State
Department announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. has been preparing a strategy for airdrops, and we
are going to be doing airdrops, hopefully, starting two weeks from
tomorrow,'' said Julia Taft, assistant secretary of state for
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The decision follows the quiet inauguration of daily truck
convoys by the governments of Greece, Russia and Switzerland to
carry food and medicine to Kosovo, Serbia and Montenegro in hopes
of heading off starvation or death from hunger-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
   In a departure from the previous stances of both sides, the
Yugoslav government and NATO agreed last week to permit the convoys
to pass safely into Kosovo. But the convoys alone are not thought
to be enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``In plain terms of need there are hundreds of thousands in
Kosovo itself, and they are in desperate need,'' said Alex Rondos,
the envoy for humanitarian affairs for the Greek Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Rondos calculates that the Kosovo Albanians who have been
displaced from their homes but who are still in Kosovo will need a
minimum of 10,000 tons of foodstuff per month. At best, the convoys
will be able to bring in 4,000 tons each month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned that these isolated populations are in very
bad shape,'' said a Pentagon official. ``We're looking at all the
options now _ ground and airdrops.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last three weeks, the Air Force has been making practice
airdrops in the United States to be prepared if NATO decides to
begin airdrops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it's possible to make the airdrops,'' said one
Pentagon official. ``But we can't promise that the food will reach
the right people or that the flights will be risk-free.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Monday, the Pentagon and the State Department had
expressed doubt about airdrops because the bundles could be picked
up by Yugoslav troops and Serbian police and because they would be
risky for the pilots flying the cargo airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been exploring quite a number of options but there
seemed no reliable suggestion short of ground troops to get the
food where it was needed,'' said Bill Frelick of the U.S. Committee
for Refugees, a private relief group, who has consulted with Ms.
Taft. ``Airdrops indicate the level of desperation we're in.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials warned that the details have yet to
be completed and that the plan could be stymied if the Yugoslav
government refuses permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might involve the U.S. government funding a private group,
pursuing this option the way the Greeks have pursued their ground
convoys,'' said James Rubin, the State Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the Greek government and a Greek relief organization
began sending aid to Kosovo with permission from the Yugoslav
government and NATO. Now the governments of Switzerland and Russia
have banded together with Greece to send in the daily convoys. The
operation informs NATO about the convoy schedules, and NATO then
tries to insure that its bombers do not hit the relief trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs have told us we can go where we want and we are
going to test that proposition,'' Rondos said. ``That makes it a
bit of a high-wire act.''
</P>
<P>
   The separatist Kosovo Liberation Army rebels have opened up a
supply corridor into Kosovo with the capture of a border post, NATO
officials say. Aid group officials say the rebels have used the
corridor to ship in arms and ammunition but might be willing to let
in relief supplies for civilians.
</P>
<P>
   For the past year, the Yugoslavs have used food as a weapon in
ejecting Albanians from Kosovo, systematically destroying their
food stocks, burning down silos and haystacks, and killing
livestock. By the end of last year, Kosovo was dependent on food
assistance from international aid organizations. In March, when the
bombing began, the aid groups fled to Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since then, the Serbs either took over the food stocks or
destroyed them,'' Frelick said.
</P>
<P>
   With the war engulfing most of the province, it is unlikely that
there will be much of a harvest this summer, according to
classified American reports. ``In the last few weeks the theme has
been consistent _ again and again it is food,'' said Fred Abrahams,
who heads the Human Rights Watch delegation on the Albanian border.
``Tens of thousands of people in central and northern Kosovo are in
danger of running out of food.''

 &HT;    K-9 officers get bullet-proof vests
 &HT;    By Sonja Isger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ After five years pounding a beat for the
Boynton Beach (Fla.) Police Department, Officer Sado got his first
police-issue, bullet-proof vest Monday morning. It's a custom-job,
leaving plenty of room for his legs _ all four of them.
</P>
<P>
   Sado, two other Boynton Beach police dogs and all 16 of the Palm
Beach County sheriff's K-9 unit have been fitted for the $350
special vests courtesy of a canine-loving chiropractor and his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   Gary and Raelynn Gagliardi say their heartstrings _ and their
purse strings _ were tugged after they heard about Solo, a police
dog killed in the line of duty in New Jersey. After Solo's death,
the local humane society raised money to buy a vest for the rest of
the department's four-legged unit.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, dog lovers like the Gagliardis have stepped forward
in communities nationwide, hoping to pay for doggie vests that
departments either can't afford or find too embarrassing to ask the
public to pay for. The Gagliardis' bill to suit up 19 dogs topped
$5,600.
</P>
<P>
   Sado has worked for years unscathed. But at least two police
dogs in Palm Beach County have died. Smokey, with Boynton Beach's
K-9 Unit, was shot in 1981 while pursuing a criminal. Cello, who
worked for Delray Beach police, died in 1984 from internal injuries
he suffered when he caught two hubcap thieves.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, police dog deaths hit an all-time high of at least
eight, said Russell Hess, executive director of the U.S. Police
Canine Association. This year, the association says two dogs have
died.
</P>
<P>
   Solo, a 3-year-old German shepherd working for the Asbury Park,
N.J., police, was brought in to break a 12-hour standoff between
police and a gunman holed up in an apartment. Solo went in and
within minutes, the dog responsible for the capture of 19 criminals
was fatally shot.
</P>
<P>
   Though a vest wouldn't have saved him (he was shot in the head),
his death spurred the local humane society to provide vests for
every police dog in the state. Since then, pet lovers from coast to
coast have picked up the cause, Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   Dog vests have been around for a few years, but only now has
technology made them truly feasible, said Sgt. Bob Anderson, who
heads the sheriff's K-9 unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first ones were quite heavy and the dogs might not have
been able to perform with the weight and heat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The vests Sado and Kazan sported Monday weigh a couple of pounds
at most. They're also color-coordinated to their handlers' uniforms
_ Boynton's wear black; the sheriff's wear Army green.
</P>
<P>
   But they did take some getting used to.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he first put it on, it was kind of like a body cast,''
Sado's handler, Boynton Officer Rich O'Connor said. ``Take a step,
stop, take a step, stop.''
</P>
<P>
   After three or four go-rounds, Sado stopped nipping at his getup
and got to work.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said he's thankful for the peace of mind the
Velcro-fitted vest gives him, and the protection it provides his
7-year-old German shepherd partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you go into a wooded area in pursuit of a criminal
and you are protected, but they're not,'' O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell 'em everything's going to be OK,'' added sheriff's
Deputy Chris Soares, who works with Kazan, a 3-year-old German
shepherd. ``But they are out there to protect officers. Having a
vest gives them a better chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the dogs have vests, Gagliardi has begun campaigning
for another cause: replacing the makeshift metal and plywood
back-seat cages the sheriff's dogs travel in with aluminium crates.

FBI IS CRITICIZED AT HEARINGS ABOUT FLIGHT 800 CRASH
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Some government experts who worked on the
investigation of the explosion of TWA Flight 800 told senators
Monday that the FBI had ignored them, mishandled evidence and
suppressed their conclusions. But the FBI agent who had been in
charge of the inquiry denounced the congressional proceeding as ``a
kangaroo court.''
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses told an oversight subcommittee of the Senate
Judiciary Committee Monday that James K. Kallstrom, the agent in
charge of the FBI's New York office, withheld a report written by
another agency, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, that
said that the center fuel tank of the 747 had exploded, apparently
for mechanical reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, the chairman of the subcommittee, said
that ``FBI leadership, in the case of TWA Flight 800, was a
disaster.'' He said the bureau, with a blind fixation on finding
evidence of a bomb or missile, lacked the skills necessary to
investigate a plane crash, and, more disturbingly, the ability to
coordinate with others.

<P>
   Kallstrom, in a telephone interview, sharply criticized the
hearings and said he was sorry he had not been allowed to testify.
He said his exhaustive hunt for clues of a possible terrorist
attack had fulfilled his promise to the families of the 230 people
who died, and to the public.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that at the time of the crash, July 16, 1996, a
bomb had just exploded at a park in Atlanta, where the Olympics
were beginning, and a terrorist, Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, was on trial
in a plot to blow up American jets over the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley's press secretary, Jill Kozney, said the committee had
asked the FBI for Kallstrom's testimony a week and a half ago, but
that the FBI had said Kallstrom would not be available because he
was giving a commencement speech Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A key matter of disagreement among investigators is the status
of a report prepared by fire and explosion experts from the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, known as ATF, that concluded that
the TWA explosion appeared to be caused by a mechanical flaw in the
center fuel tank. The FBI, in response to a subcommittee request,
produced a March 1997 cover letter from Kallstrom to James E. Hall,
the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, that it
said was transmitted with the report. But the letter is not signed,
and Senator Grassley expressed doubt that it had ever been sent.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials testifying Monday said it had, and Kallstrom said
he had forwarded the report within a day or two of receiving it.
</P>
<P>
   Safety board officials say they have no record of having
formally received the report, although they acknowledge having got
a copy ``over the transom.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the cover letter was hardly generous to the experts
who prepared the report. It said, ``The publication of this
unsolicited and premature report by the ATF violates the agreement
made by them regarding their participation in this investigation.''
It was, the cover letter said, ``an extraordinary violation of
investigative protocol.''
</P>
<P>
   Kallstrom, now an executive with a bank in Delaware, said
Monday, ``The only problem I had with the report was we weren't
done with the investigation; we were nowhere near finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``The center fuel tank blew up, we all agreed with that,'' he
said. ``To reach the conclusion that it was not criminal, with tons
of wreckage still in the water, after we gave our word to victims'
families that we were going to do everything possible, well, we
weren't at 70 percent of doing everything possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Grassley said the FBI's reluctance to give up on the bomb or
missile theories had made it hard for the safety board to persuade
the Federal Aviation Administration to take corrective steps, but
safety board officials were not clear on that point.
</P>
<P>
   Three investigators testified that they were sometimes shoved
aside by the FBI, and they criticized the bureau's approach to the
case. A safety board metallurgist, Frank Zakar, said the bomb or
missile idea was ``dominant from the very beginning'' with the FBI
</P>
<P>
   But two FBI officials who testified said the investigation had
gone so well that it was a model for the future. Donald M. Kerr,
the assistant director of the FBI laboratory division, said that
the ATF report could have turned into a problem if a terrorism
suspect had been arrested, because a defense lawyer could have used
it to cast doubt on a prosecutor's argument.

CLINTON APPROVES TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER TO CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration notified Congress Monday
that it had approved the export of technology to China to permit
the launching of a communications satellite aboard a Chinese rocket
next month.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said in a letter to Congress that the transfer
would not harm national security nor significantly improve China's
military capability in space. The president was required under a
1998 law to certify that all such technology exports are in the
national interest.
</P>
<P>
   The certification was the first such notice to Congress under
the law, which was passed in the aftermath of a congressional
uproar last year over the transfer of sensitive missile technology
to China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's notification also follows by less than a week the
release of a report by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence,
which concluded that lax monitoring of the launching of
American-made satellites aboard Chinese rockets had enhanced the
accuracy of China's ballistic missile arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   And the action comes three days after the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia, was inadvertently bombed in a NATO raid,
touching off three days of angry street protests in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The president's action will affect the June 7 launching of a
Motorola Iridium satellite, which is to fly into low orbit to
provide paging and cellular telephone service. Clinton said he had
approved the export of satellite fuel and explosive bolts, which
eject the satellite from its launch vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's action was the final approval needed for the launch,
which was first authorized in July 1993. A license for the export
of the satellite itself was granted in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing of this certification is not connected in any way
to the tragic accident of the bombing of the Chinese Embassy,''
said David Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council.
``Approval was recommended by the Departments of Commerce, State
and Defense and is consistent with our policy of supporting the
launch of U.S. communications satellites by China subject to strong
safeguards being in place.''
</P>
<P>
   A staff member of the intelligence panel said it was unlikely to
contest the approval of the technology. But he said questions might
be raised over whether the explosive bolts might someday be used to
help eject nuclear warheads from a missile.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cezanne's ``Still Life With Curtain, Pitcher and Bowl
of Fruit'' sold for $60.5 million on Monday night _ a record sale
price for the artist _ as Sotheby's auctioned all 50 works from one
of the world's fabled art collections.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary group of Impressionist and modern paintings,
drawings and sculptures was from the estate of Betsey Cushing
Roosevelt Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   The auction brought $128 million, far above its high estimate of
$90 million, making it the second-highest single owner sale in
history. (The record still belongs to the sale of 20th century art
from New York collectors Victor and Sally Ganz that sold at
Christie's a year and a half ago for $206 million.)
</P>
<P>
   Records were set Monday night for five artists, including
Cezanne and Seurat. Seurat's ``Landscape, Island of the Grande
Jatte'' (1884) sold for $35.2 million; it, like Cezanne's
``Landscape,'' was estimated at $25 million to $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could feel the desire pulsating in the room,'' said Lisa
Dennison, a deputy director and chief curator of the Solomon R.
Guggenheim Museum. ``In a sense it was a historic auction because
nothing failed to sell. It was also a sale where two museum
pictures didn't end up in museums.''
</P>
<P>
   The Whitney collection was one of the last great private
collections to come to auction. Collectors and dealers from around
the world gathered in Sotheby's York Avenue salesroom to try to buy
a piece.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Whitney, the New York socialite and philanthropist who died
in March 1998, was married to John Hay Whitney, the financier,
publisher and former ambassador to Britain, who died in 1982. The
couple formed their collection largely on the advice of John
Rewald, a teacher, curator and expert on Impressionist and
post-Impressionist art, who died four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Their collection was rivaled only by those of the Greek shipping
magnate Stavros Niarchos, who died in 1996, and Walter H.
Annenberg, another former ambassador to Britain, who has promised
to leave his collection of Impressionist and post-Impressionist
paintings to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where he keeps them on
view six months a year.
</P>
<P>
   At her death, Mrs. Whitney left paintings worth more than $300
million to four American museums: the National Gallery of Art and
the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, the Museum of Modern
Art and the Yale University Art Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   But that was just a part of the couple's holdings. Another group
of paintings was bequeathed to the Greentree Foundation, run by her
two daughters, Kate Whitney and Sara Wilford, and her lawyer Robert
Carswell. Another group _ the paintings, drawings and sculptures
sold Monday night _ were left to her daughters, who put them up for
sale to help pay their taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Final prices Monday include the auction house's commission, 15
percent of the first $50,000 plus 10 percent of the rest. Estimates
do not reflect commissions.
</P>
<P>
   By far Monday's most dramatic moment came when four people
(three bidding by telephone) fought long and hard to buy Cezanne's
``Still Life,'' (1893-94), considered a first-rate example of the
artist's mature still lifes.
</P>
<P>
   After a slow, steady bidding battle that heated up when the
price topped $42 million, the painting finally sold to an
unidentified buyer who was bidding through Diana D. Brooks,
Sotheby's chief executive, for $60 million, well above its high $35
million estimate. The salesroom burst into applause.
</P>
<P>
   Before the sale, there were rumors that several museums would be
bidders. The J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles was said to be one
of the bidders for the Cezanne, and the Metropolitan Museum was
said to be making a stab at buying the Seurat. But Sotheby's
officials said Monday night that they didn't think any museums were
buyers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One person said to be giving both institutions some competition
was Stephen A. Wynn, chief executive of Mirage Resorts, who has
been paying top dollar for big-name artists for years now and is
displaying many of them in his museum in the Bellagio, one of his
hotel and casino complexes in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn has a history of buying art from some of this country's
most distinguished families. In 1996, he bought a Manet once owned
by Henry and Louisine Havemeyer.
</P>
<P>
   Seurat's ``Landscape'' (1884) is one of two large final studies
for the artist's famous ``Sunday on la Grande Jatte,'' which hangs
in the Art Institute of Chicago. The other study, a composition
with figures, is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Two important Picassos, both acquired in 1968 from the
collection of Gertrude Stein, also were sold. ``Still Life With
Bottle of Rum'' (1914), a Cubist work that recreated the effects of
collage and paint, made the third highest price of the evening,
selling for $7.9 million, nicely above its $6 million high
estimate. The other, ``The Newspaper'' (1912), a widely exhibited
painting from the artist's high period of analytical Cubism, was
estimated at $4 million to $6 million and went for $6.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Berthe Morisot's ``Hide and Seek'' (1873), a classic
Impressionist scene of the artist's sister and niece playing
hide-and-seek in a country landscape, sold for $3.85 million, above
its $2.2 million estimate.

GILBERT MILLSTEIN, 83, REVIEWER WHO GAVE EARLY BOOST TO KEROUAC
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gilbert Millstein, who wrote an early review of Jack
Kerouac's novel ``On the Road'' that helped establish the fame of
both Kerouac and the Beat Generation, died May 7 at Tisch Hospital
of New York University Medical Center. He was 83 and lived in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was kidney failure, said his wife, Barbara Head.
</P>
<P>
   Millstein was also the news editor of the ``NBC Nightly News''
for a decade beginning in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Millstein's 1957 review of ``On the Road'' in The New York Times
described the novel as ``an authentic work of art, the most
beautifully executed, the clearest and the most important utterance
yet made by the generation Kerouac himself named years ago as
`beat,' and whose principal avatar he is.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 The Los Angeles Times said Millstein was still
remembered as the critic who ``propelled both Kerouac and his Beat
Generation beatitudes from limbo to limelight.''
</P>
<P>
   Millstein worked for the Sunday department of The New York Times
from 1949 to 1963, writing book reviews and articles on a variety
of topics; he continued to do so after leaving its staff. His other
work included articles for magazines like The Saturday Evening
Post, two novels and the text for ``New York: True North'' (1964),
a book of photographs by Sam Falk, a photographer for The Times.
</P>
<P>
   Millstein was born and reared in the Bronx and graduated from
City College.
</P>
<P>
   He worked as a writer for newspapers in Philadelphia and New
York and for Time Inc. before joining The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   His marriages to Ruth Moret and Patricia Kip ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife he is survived by three sons, Ezra, of
Manhattan; Joshua, of East Hampton, N.Y., and Jonathan, of
Brooklyn; a stepdaughter, Tamar Losee of Queens; five
grandchildren, and a brother, Ezra, who lives near Los Angeles.

FORMER NFL STAR DIAL THROWN FOR LOSS OVER PENSION 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A federal appellate court has vacated an order
allowing Texas football legend Buddy Dial to recover full benefits
from the National Football League's disability plan.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, U.S. District Judge Vanessa Gilmore of Houston
ordered reinstatement of all disability funds for the former Rice
University, Pittsburgh Steelers and Dallas Cowboys receiver,
totally disabled by football injuries.
</P>
<P>
   But in a ruling released Monday, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in New Orleans vacated Gilmore's order and remanded the
case back to her ``to render judgment in favor of'' the NFL and
Dial's ex-wife, Janice Marye.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a defeat for Buddy, but it's not the end of the world,''
said Dial's attorney, Tom Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   He said he may ask for a new hearing before the appellate court,
or he may try to take the case to state court.
</P>
<P>
   Dial, 62, sued the NFL's disability plan in 1996 after its
administrator decided in 1994 that Dial's ex-wife _ divorced from
him since 1979 _ was entitled to 50 percent of his $4,000-a-month
disability income.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore ruled that the NFL-players union agreement that led to
creation of the disability plan in 1993 had been misinterpreted.
</P>
<P>
   Marye's being awarded half of Dial's retirement income upon
their divorce had no bearing on the then-nonexistent disability
income, Gilmore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``NFL's interpretation,'' she said, ``suggests that any other
separate property that comes into existence after the parties are
divorced and is later discovered would be subject to equal
division.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the 5th Circuit said the NFL's disability plan
administrators correctly interpreted the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the NFL and Marye could not be reached for comment
late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Dial was an All-America end for Rice in 1958 and played
professionally for Pittsburgh and then Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   He was declared permanently disabled because of his
football-related injuries after the plan was initiated in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He is among a handful of players who receive complete NFL
disability pensions as a result of playing football.

   SEEN AS NEXT HOT DIET PILL, XENICAL RAISES CONCERNS
</P>
<P>
   Although orlistat, a diet pill approved for sale in the United
States two weeks ago and marketed under the brand name Xenical, is
available only by prescription, it is being made easily available.
</P>
<P>
   Some promoters are already treating the new drug as the next
magic potion for fighting obesity, and some health care
professionals and advocates for the obese worry that many Americans
will start popping Xenical without giving adequate consideration to
the costs, benefits and side effects.

   CHEVRON AND TEXACO SEEN IN TALKS
</P>
<P>
   Chevron, the nation's third-biggest oil company, and Texaco, the
fourth largest, have had preliminary talks about a possible deal, a
person close to one of the companies said, but no agreement is
imminent. Still, many analysts and industry consultants said that
any deal would be difficult to achieve.

   SANGSTAT MEDICAL SHARES RISE 23 PERCENT

   Shares in Sangstat Medical, a biotechnology company in
California, gained 23 percent after Abbott Laboratories agreed to

United States. Shares of Sangstat rose $2.75, to $14.5625.

   HOPES FADE FOR CHINA TRADE PACT
</P>
<P>
   In the days before NATO mistakenly bombed the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia, administration officials voiced fears that
they had already missed their moment last month to strike a
political deal to get China into the World Trade Organization. Now
the hopes of patching together that deal in the next few months are
quickly fading.

   MICROSOFT TO BUY 4 PERCENT STAKE IN NEXTEL

   Microsoft agreed to pay $600 million to buy 4 percent of Nextel

   A PACKAGING DISPUTE FOR PERFUMES
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Klein's fragrance Eternity smells nothing like Ralph
Lauren's Romance, but Calvin Klein contends that the bottle for
Romance is too similar to the one for its perfume and could confuse
consumers. So it sued. A federal judge rejected an injunction that
had sought to stop Ralph Lauren from selling or advertising
Romance, but the suit is still pending.
</P>
<P>
   FDA BACKS QUICK DRUG APPROVAL
</P>
<P>
   When the Food and Drug Administration was forced to ban five
prescription drugs in a recent one-year period, critics said the
agency had compromised patient safety as it hurried new medicines
to market. The agency's new commissioner has responded, making
public an internal review that found the emphasis on speedy drug
approvals is not to blame.

   NEW YORK _ Unrelenting and indignant, defense lawyers Monday dug
into the smallest details of Abner Louima's allegations of abuse
and torture by New York City police officers.
</P>
<P>
   They asked him to recall precisely where he was punched, to
describe every snippet of conversation, to recount to the minute
how long he stood in a particular spot. One defense lawyer asked
Louima if he was somehow being coached in his answers by a
courtroom spectator.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one inflammatory topic defense lawyers have
studiously avoided in their continuing cross-examination of Louima:
Of the hundreds of questions they have posed so far, not one has
been about sex.
</P>
<P>
   The silence on this subject is noteworthy. Last week, during
opening arguments in federal court in Brooklyn, a lawyer for the
officer accused of driving a stick into Louima's rectum suggested
that Louima's extensive internal injuries were caused by consensual
gay sex.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Marvyn M. Kornberg, told jurors that a trace of
Louima's feces _ found in the police precinct bathroom where the
alleged assault occurred _ contained ``the DNA of another male.''
He also said Louima's injuries were ``not consistent'' with
``nonconsensual insertion'' _ an argument that prompted prosecutors
to ask Louima about his wife and children, presumably to deflect
the idea that he had had sex with a man.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, though, Kornberg ended more than four hours of
questioning without asking Louima about his sex life. Kornberg
declined to discuss why he had not raised the subject, but others
involved in the defense of his client, Officer Justin A. Volpe,
said Monday that the silence was a calculated tactic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an answer to that, but I'm not prepared to give it,''
Les Levine, a private investigator for Kornberg, said when asked
why Louima had not been questioned about his sexual habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an oversight,'' said Robert Volpe, Officer Volpe's
father. ``You're at the beginning of the movie,'' he said with a
wink. ``Let the movie play.''
</P>
<P>
   But a lawyer for another of the five police officers charged
with violating Louima's civil rights said it was too risky to raise
the subject with Louima. No doubt, Louima would have denied the
contention, said the lawyer, who did not want to be identified. And
in the absence of contradictory testimony, such questions might be
perceived by jurors to be a cheap shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no profit in it,'' the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe Tardieu, a lawyer who attended Monday's testimony as a
spectator, put it more bluntly: ``You run the risk now of having
the jury hate the defendant.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Consequently, defense lawyers focused on safer subjects Monday,
such as Louima's admission that he lied _ in public and before
grand juries _ when he said that one officer told him during the
alleged assault, ``It's Giuliani time.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers also reminded jurors that the ``dream team'' of
Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., Barry Scheck and Peter J. Neufeld _ which
represented O.J. Simpson _ is representing Louima in his civil suit
against the city.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, though, the hours of cross-examination produced more
yawns than drama. Treating the defense lawyers with extreme
caution, Louima answered questions as if they entered his brain on
a time delay. After even the simplest questions, Louima would sit
silent and still for several seconds, his eyes searching the
ceiling. Finally, just as his questioner seemed about to lose
patience, Louima would offer a quiet reply, most often a simple
``Yes, sir'' or ``No, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   Over and over, he asked the defense lawyers to repeat questions,
or he asked them to show him documents to refresh his recollection
or he said he did not understand what they were asking.
</P>
<P>
   In basketball terms, Louima pursued a slow-paced half-court game
while defense lawyers tried to run the floor, peppering him rapid
fire with questions. In this regard, Louima was the clear victor
Monday, and at times his implacable, respectful manner appeared to
get on the nerves of his interrogators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes or no?'' Kornberg asked several times in evident
exasperation at Louima's deliberate responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you let him finish the answer?'' Judge Eugene H.
Nickerson told Kornberg more than once.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen C. Worth, a lawyer for Officer Charles Schwarz, became
so aggressive and loud that Nickerson sternly admonished him,
``Keep it down.''
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how strenuous the questioning, Louima remained as
unflappable as a diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't he being intentionally forgetful to avoid damaging
answers, he was asked. ``If I remember, I say what I remember,'' he
replied.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't his civil lawyers coach him on how to avoid answering
questions?
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that they tell me is tell the truth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't he provoke police officers by fighting and cursing at
them?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' he said, his voice steady as ever.

STEWART KLEIN, 66, TV CRITIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stewart Klein, a music, film and theater critic for WYNY-TV in
New York since 1967, died on Sunday at his home in Fort Lee, N.J.
He was 66.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was colon cancer, his wife, Barbara, said.
</P>
<P>
   Klein won three local Emmy awards for his work, including one
for a memorable review in 1978, in which he skewered ``Sebastian,''
a film that had been made entirely in Latin, by reciting his review
in Latin. Like the film, his review carried subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Osgood, the anchor of ``CBS News Sunday Morning,'' said
Klein's special quality lay in being ``very down to earth and at
the same time very well read.'' When the two worked together at ABC
Radio in the early 1960s, Klein introduced him to the writing of
A.J. Liebling and I.F. Stone, Osgood said, ``to give me some sense
of what journalism was really about.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein was widely considered the dean of the critics on New York
television stations, although at the start of his career he
confided to a fellow critic, Judith Crist, that he had no idea how
to review a film. He became, she said on Monday, ``the ultimate
critic.''
</P>
<P>
   Born and reared in Philadelphia and a graduate of Temple
University, Klein came to New York as a radio reporter in 1961. He
was at WNEW-AM when its sister station WNEW-TV decided to start a
10 p.m. news broadcast, and he was on the original team. He
remained as the station later became a Fox affiliate; it is now
WYNY. He also did theater and movie reviews for ``Good Day New
York,'' the station's morning news program, and ``Fox 5 Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein, an enthusiastic fan of both jazz and Latin music, met his
wife of 16 years at the jazz club Michael's Pub in Manhattan, where
she was a lighting designer who sat down at his table one evening
to chat. She and their son Matthew survive him, as do three
children from a previous marriage, Marjorie Klein of New York;
Joseph, of Miami Beach, and Joann Cueva of Danbury, Conn., and two
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Although some critics on television confined themselves to
reviewing high-profile Broadway productions, Klein often reviewed
Off Broadway shows and sometimes foreign films. And if he really
disliked a movie, he enjoyed giving it a curt review, said Bob
O'Brien, a WYNY reporter who worked with Klein for 31 years. He
recalled that Klein reviewed the expensive 1987 flop ``Ishtar''
with these words: ```Ishtar.' Stinkar.''

STATE TO TEST CHANGES TO EASE BURDEN OF GRAND JURY DUTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ALAN FINDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an attempt to make service on grand juries less
burdensome, New York state court officials said on Monday that they
would set up experiments in six counties around the state to try
out different ways of reducing the length of a grand jury's term.
</P>
<P>
   While the officials did not offer many concrete details of how
the experiments would work, the announcement was the court system's
first response to a lengthy report, also released on Monday, from a
panel of lawyers, judges and other legal experts on how to improve
the grand jury system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should minimize the time that jurors should have to
serve,'' said Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye, who created the panel in
December 1997 to consider ways of making service on grand juries
less onerous. The effort to rethink grand juries followed a series
of successful initiatives by Judge Kaye to improve the lot of New
Yorkers called to sit on conventional juries, which are known
formally as petit juries.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike service on conventional juries, where people are screened
to sit on a single trial, those called for grand juries hear
evidence on dozens of criminal cases and vote on whether defendants
should be indicted. The statewide average for service on a trial
jury is 2 days; grand jurors serve an average of 12 days, state
court officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, grand jurors in Brooklyn and Queens serve for
a month, meeting all day every weekday. In some rural counties, a
grand jury meets one day a week for three or even four months.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the states around the country have eliminated most
grand juries because of the cost, the inconvenience for the jurors
and the difficulty of assembling witnesses. They rely instead on
hearings and other forms of judicial review.
</P>
<P>
   The New York state constitution requires, however, that
prosecution of a felony be sanctioned through an indictment by a
grand jury. So Judge Kaye asked the panel to research ways of
enhancing the existing system in New York and improving the
experience of individuals who find themselves on a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems wise to do what we could do to make the existing
system a better one for everyone,'' Judge Kaye said at a news
conference during which the report was released and the experiments
announced.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, which was led by Stephen E. Kaufman, a prominent
defense lawyer, proposed several steps, including the creation of
pilot programs in several counties, upstate and downstate, large
and small, to test different strategies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the panel proposed creating two kinds of grand
juries. One would consider only relatively minor, uncomplicated
cases that take a day or less to present to jurors; it should be
possible to control the maximum term of such a grand jury, the
panel said. A second kind of grand jury would examine only the more
complex cases, the type that can take two or three days to
consider.
</P>
<P>
   The six counties selected for the pilot program are Albany,
Kings (Brooklyn), Monroe, Onondaga, Saratoga and Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   The panel created by Judge Kaye also proposed increasing the pay
for some grand jurors, who now receive $40 a day. It suggested an
increase to $60 a day for each day of service between 11 and 20
days, and $80 a day for service beyond 20 days. Judge Kaye endorsed
the increase, but she also noted that the proposal would require
approval of the State Legislature.  &QL;

PITCHER'S BLOCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tim Belcher walked off the mound after giving up a
run in a recent game and yelled an expletive that could be heard
clearly all the way up to the press box.
</P>
<P>
   Signed to a two-year, $10.2 million contract to be the Anaheim
Angels' No. 2 starter, Belcher, 37, has been cursing a lot lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim Belcher competes,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said.
``He's a little bit of a perfectionist. That's what makes him so
good.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also what's driving Belcher crazy these days.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-year veteran, Belcher was supposed to give the Angels
innings _ he's one of only four pitchers to throw 200 or more
innings every year since 1991 (excluding strike-shortened 1994 and
'95).
</P>
<P>
   Yet this season, he's made it out of the sixth inning only once
and gotten out of the fifth only twice in seven starts. He's 1-3
with a staff-worst 9.89 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   So what's wrong? Has a pitcher who won 42 games in the past
three seasons with the weak-hitting Kansas City Royals lost it? The
Angels say no; he just needs a little time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not concerned,'' Collins said. ``He's a veteran guy,
he's been through this before. You could say maybe he's off to a
slow start, because his health is good and he's throwing well. He's
just making mistakes. As long as he feels good, he's going to pitch
his way out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of Belcher's worst games came when the offense gave him a
big hand. In Toronto on April 22, Belcher took a 7-2 lead into the
fifth inning and couldn't get three more outs. He gave up four in
the inning and the Angels eventually lost 8-7.
</P>
<P>
   At home against the same Blue Jays on April 28, Belcher took a
10-0 lead into the fifth and again couldn't get the victory. He
gave up six in the inning before Collins took him out. The Angels
eventually won that one 12-10.
</P>
<P>
   In four of his seven starts, Belcher took the mound for the
fifth but had to leave before getting out of the inning. His
fifth-inning ERA is 40.50, while his ERA in the first four innings
is 4.82.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher, though, says the problem isn't the fifth inning. Though
he hasn't given up nearly as many runs in innings 1-4, he says
those innings aren't much different than the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The misconception is that I'm throwing `four brilliant
innings,' '' he said. ``They're not so brlliant. The first time
through the order I might be able to get away with some things that
you're not able to get away with the second and third time through
the order. I think that's what's happening more than anything. I
just need to make better pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   When Belcher is missing with his pitches, he's missing right
down the middle. He's working with pitching coach Dick Pole and
bullpen coach Joe Coleman to correct the problem, but that's all he
can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not searching for any major flaw,'' Belcher said. ``I'm
not going to make any major changes. You get into trouble doing
that kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody knows why (Belcher is struggling),''
Collins said. ``You look at film and see what feels good and what
doesn't. Sometimes you just keep working. There's no easy fix. You
just grind your way through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher, whose next start is Friday at home against Tampa Bay,
says he will pitch every game with the same idea that has helped
him win 137 major-league games, including one this year in which he
gave up just two runs and four hits in seven innings against
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't approach it any differently,'' he said. ``Every start,
every game I have the idea of throwing a shutout. If I give up one,
I try not to give up two. If that goes by the board, I try to give
up less than the other guy.''

 &HT;    Texas House votes to lower DWI limit
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Aiming to improve the state's dismal drunken
driving record, the Texas House on Monday voted to lower the legal
intoxication threshold to a blood alcohol level of .08 from the
current .10.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has already approved the change, and Gov. George W.
Bush is expected to sign it into law. Texas would join more than a
dozen other states that have lowered their legal limits to .08.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Senate Bill 114, authored by Sen. Mario Gallegos
Jr., D-Houston, argue that it will save the lives of hundreds of
Texans. In 1997, Texas led the nation in alcohol-related traffic
deaths, with 1,748. Of those, 379 involved drivers with blood
alcohol levels of under .10.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government estimates that a 170-pound person could
have four drinks in one hour without hitting the .08 threshold. The
same person could have five drinks without breaking the .10 limit.
A 137-pound person could have three drinks in an hour as opposed to
four.
</P>
<P>
   The alcoholic beverage industry and other opponents contend that
the .08 limit will net social drinkers, and that studies focusing
solely on the effect of lowering the threshold are inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The .08 campaign is not effective because it's not targeting
the right people,'' American Beverage Institute spokesman John
Doyle said last month. ``More needs to be done on drunk driving,
not on drinking and driving.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Scott Hochberg, who shepherded Gallegos' bill through
the House, pointed to a National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration survey that concluded drunken driving deaths
declined in five of seven states that only lowered the limit. The
National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism has found that
alcohol can hamper steering ability at a level of .035, and impairs
vision at between .03 and .05.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you want your child to get on a school bus if the driver
had just had four shots of whiskey in an hour on an empty
stomach?'' asked Hochberg, D-Houston. ``And yet you're doing that
when you put your child on the road in a car when there are other
drivers who have done that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the social drinker. It is not a glass of wine with
dinner. It is a significant amount of alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   No lawmaker rose to oppose lowering the limit, and the bill
passed on a voice vote. The House rejected two amendments by Rep.
Harold Dutton, D-Houston, which would have lowered the limit to
zero and .05.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has urged states to adopt the .08 limit, and by
lowering its threshold Texas will be eligible for about $12 million
in federal highway grant money.
</P>
<P>
   But Hochberg didn't mention the highway money during the floor
debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't the right thing to do, I don't think we should
have done it for the money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most Texans favor lowering the legal threshold _ even though
many of them are skeptical that the change will reduce the number
of alcohol-related accidents, according to a recent Texas Poll.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-seven percent of those who responded to the telephone
survey said they support lowering the limit to .08. But only a
third of the 1,003 people polled believe the change will make the
roads safer.

CHEVRON AND TEXACO REPORTED IN MERGER TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Chevron Corp., the nation's third biggest oil company, and
Texaco Inc., the fourth largest, have held preliminary talks about
a possible deal, according to a person close to one of the
companies. It is unclear whether such talks are continuing, but the
person said that no agreement was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, amid reports of a possible merger, many analysts and
industry consultants said on Monday that any such deal would be
very difficult to achieve. They noted that the cost savings that
other oil mergers have attained would be difficult with two
streamlined companies and that antitrust issues would be more
pronounced than with other oil mergers because of Chevron's and
Texaco's heavy presence on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the stocks of both companies steadied on Monday after
sharp moves on Friday, when speculation about a possible deal was
rampant.
</P>
<P>
   Texaco shares fell $1.375 on Monday, to $65.875. On Friday, the
stock surged 8 percent. Chevron shares rose $1.375 on Monday, to
$96.25, after falling 3 percent on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Chevron was in
talks to acquire Texaco for about $80 a share, or about $42
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for both companies declined to comment on whether they
were in talks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since the $42.8 billion takeover of the Amoco Corp. by British
Petroleum in August, which then also reached an agreement to buy
the Atlantic Richfield Co. last month, there has been pressure on
other major oil companies to merge. The Exxon Corp., the largest
oil company in the United States reached an $80 billion agreement
early in December to take over the Mobil Corp., the second largest
U.S. oil company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's a game of musical chairs when the music has
stopped,'' said Michael Young, an oil analyst for Deutsche Bank
Securities in Boston. He referred to the remaining major oil
companies that had not found merger partners.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, he said, is that it was hard to demonstrate how
Chevron and Texaco, which had both cut costs extensively in recent
years and announced another round of cuts last year when crude oil
prices plunged, could achieve further large savings by combining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both companies are already operating on a lean basis,'' he
said. In December, Texaco executives outlined a belt-tightening
that would take another $650 million out of costs annually and to
cut 3,000 jobs. A good part of its corporate headquarters in White
Plains, N.Y., will be rented out.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron, which is based in San Francisco, said it plans to cut
another $500 million out of its cost structure on top of the $2.4
billion it has already achieved since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Quarls, a senior vice president for Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton,
a consulting firm, said that if Chevron paid a premium of about $10
billion for Texaco it would have to find about $1 billion in cost
savings to justify the merger. That would not be easy, he added.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that it would be a challenge to work out the
management transition since there were strong and independent
minded executives on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Bijur, the chairman and chief executive of Texaco who is
57 and who took over in July 1996, ``is young and just starting his
tenure,'' Quarls said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth T. Derr, the chairman and chief executive of Chevron and
who is 62, has spearheaded Chevron's entry into the Caspian region
where it has bought into production major fields in Kazakhstan. It
is the first Western oil company to get large amounts of oil from
the region into foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the two executives could work out a way to overcome
their independence and find a way to manage together, they would
face major problems in coming up with a way to demonstrate to the
Federal Trade Commission that their presence in refining and
marketing on the West Coast and other parts of the country would
not be anticompetitive.
</P>
<P>
   Another complication is an alliance that Texaco formed last year
with the Shell Oil Co., the U.S. arm of the Royal Dutch/Shell
Group, to combine and revamp their refining, which now controls
about 15 percent of the American market.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the work has been done. It would be complicated for
Texaco to find a way to get the alliance to fit into a merger with
Chevron, which is one of the largest refiners and marketers of
gasoline in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, some analysts believe that the attempts to bring the
companies together are slim.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be just a lot of smoke and we'll never see a
fire,'' said Fred Leuffer, an oil analyst for Bear Stearns.

SANGSTAT SHARES SOAR ON NEWS OF ABBOTT DISTRIBUTION DEAL
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Calif., Ill.)  (nk) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Shares in the Sangstat Medical Corp. gained 23
percent Monday after Abbott Laboratories Inc. agreed to distribute
the company's generic versions of a drug that helps prevent organ
rejection in transplant patients in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Sangstat, a biotechnology company based in Menlo Park, Calif.,
received approval from the Food and Drug Administration in November
for Sangcya, its liquid form of the anti-rejection drug
cyclosporine. But shares of Sangstat have declined from a high of
$32.125 in January because of concerns that Novartis A.G., the
Swiss pharmaceuticals giant that invented cyclosporine, would be
able to block Sangcya sales through patent litigation and superior
marketing muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Sangstat shares rose $2.75, to $14.5625, in Nasdaq trading.
Abbott fell 37.5 cents, to $46.50, on the New York Stock Exchange.
The American depository receipts of Novartis fell 62.5 cents, to
$76.375.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a very intelligent move for Sangstat,'' said
Sergio Traversa, an analyst with Mehta Partners. ``The old story is
alive again.''
</P>
<P>
   Abbott, based in Abbott Park, Ill., will co-promote and
distribute Sangcya and cyclosporine capsules, which Sangstat said
it expected to introduce next year. Abbott will buy $14 million of
Sangstat stock, give up-front and milestone payments and make a
long-term loan to Sangstat. The companies did not disclose the
amount of the payments and loan. Abbott now makes and markets
products that aid in the care of transplant patients.
</P>
<P>
   Gaining Abbott as a marketing partner should increase confidence
in Sangstat's ability to compete with Novartis. Sangstat had
already reached a deal to have Abbott make Sangcya, but there had
been speculation that either Novartis, through its generic unit,
Geneva, or Abbott itself would introduce a generic cyclosporine
capsule. Novartis sued Sangstat for patent infringement earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it takes away a lot of the worries that have flowed
from rumors for the last three months,'' Philippe Pouletty,
Sangstat's chairman, said in a telephone interview. ``It shows that
Sangstat and Abbott can compete very effectively with Novartis. On
the legal side it doesn't change the fact that they have filed a
suit, but it tells investors that maybe the lawsuit from Novartis
is not very serious, which we have said all along.''
</P>
<P>
   Traversa said that investors were less concerned by the lawsuit
then by the potential competition for the capsules.
</P>
<P>
   Cyclosporine has approximately $1.35 billion in global sales and
more than $500 million in sales in the United States, but the
liquid form is less than 5 percent of that, he said. By pairing
with Abbott, Sangstat ``has almost exclusivity, because no one
else, except for Novartis, of course, has the ability to
manufacture cyclosporine in quantity,'' he said. ``Until the
capsule is on the market, we won't see big sales.''

WHITMAN WINS CLOSE FIGHT TO PUT ALLY ON HIGH COURT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Ending one of the most contentious battles of
Gov. Christie Whitman's six years in office, the
Republican-controlled state Senate on Monday narrowly approved
Whitman's nominee for the state Supreme Court, Attorney General
Peter Verniero.
</P>
<P>
   Brushing aside complaints that Verniero is too inexperienced to
serve on the high court and was too slow to investigate complaints
of racial profiling by state troopers, Republicans delivered just
enough votes _ 21 _ to insure a majority of the 40-member Senate.
Three Republicans broke ranks and opposed the confirmation, joining
all 15 Democratic senators who were present.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, which came after a weekend of intense lobbying of six
undecided Republicans, was a hard-fought victory for Whitman. With
Verniero's confirmation she has now appointed three of the court's
seven justices, putting a decidedly more conservative imprint on a
court that had developed a national reputation for judicial
activism. And because of impending retirements, she will have the
opportunity to appoint even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate's confirmation of Peter Verniero will insure that
the court will continue to function as one of the greatest courts
in the nation,'' Whitman said in a statement Monday night.
``Notwithstanding the bitter partisan debate that seems to have
defined far too much of the discussion on this nomination, I have
full confidence that Peter Verniero will be a unifying force for
justice in New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats condemned the vote as a display of brute political
power by Republicans who ignored the New Jersey Bar Association's
determination that Verniero was not qualified for the state Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Richard J. Codey said legislators would
ultimately weaken the court if they began appointing justices based
on political loyalty rather than credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes loyalty demands too much,'' Codey said.
</P>
<P>
   The intense debate over Verniero's qualifications, which has
dominated the state's political agenda for the last two months,
also focused attention on the Whitman administration's handling of
allegations that the state police discriminated against black and
Hispanic drivers by stopping them disproportionately, a practice
known as racial profiling. Despite mounting evidence of the
practice, Whitman and Verniero only acknowledged in recent weeks
that racial profiling had occurred.
</P>
<P>
   At public hearings last week, Verniero refused to accept blame
for the discrimination by some troopers, insisting instead that he
deserved credit for releasing the first official state document to
admit the existence of racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   During a news conference that followed the confirmation vote
Monday night, he dismissed the notion that he might atone for his
belated response to the racial profiling issue by becoming a
champion for civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already been a champion for civil rights as attorney
general,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But many Democrats, and some Republicans, suspect that the issue
may later hurt Whitman as she runs for the U.S. Senate in 2000,
especially in minority districts, where she has never enjoyed
strong support.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Reginald Jackson, leader of the Black Ministers'
Council of New Jersey, said he considered the confirmation vote a
slap in the face and urged black voters to remember it the next
time candidates ask for their support. ``The minority community in
this state has to recognize that unless people in power feel they
have some price to pay for things like this, things will just
continue to go on as they are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Verniero, 40, has devoted more than half his life to working for
Republican Party causes but has never served as a judge or tried a
case before a jury. He has spent six years as Whitman's chief of
staff, chief counsel and attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   The final Senate tally was one vote short because a Democratic
senator, Wynona Lipman of Newark, died over the weekend.

 &HT;    Compaq takes step to streamline delivery in its battle with Dell
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In a major effort to simplify a strategy that
straddles two opposing business models, Compaq Computer Corp.
dramatically pared the number of companies that distribute its
business computers to four from 39, the company announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The move, which was expected, is the first major change since
Compaq's board forced Chief Executive Eckhard Pfeiffer to resign
April 18 and was viewed with approval by investors. Compaq stock
closed up $1.50 at $26.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that partnering with four major companies, each of
which operates from Compaq's 280-acre Houston headquarters, makes
Compaq more efficient, gives it better control of its inventory and
may shore up its ability to compete on prices with Round Rock-based
Dell Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The four distributors will be responsible for supplying Compaq's
large network of resellers, companies that sell directly to
Compaq's business customers and install computers they purchase.
Large retailers that sell Compaq PCs, such as CompUSA, are not
expected to be affected by Monday's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Kay of International Data Corp., an industry research
company near Boston, said Compaq no longer will have to keep 39
distributors supplied with a full selection of its portable,
desktop and server computers for businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made good sense, even from the sheer economies of it,'' he
said. ``In each location they had to have a full set of products.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, said Steve Dube of Wasserstein Perella Securities in
New York, Compaq's announcement is a welcome signal that the No. 1
computer maker is no longer waffling on its commitment to the
``channel,'' a network of partners that sell and install its
machines to corporate and business accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, after backing and filling for two years, they've
accepted the fact that the channel was, is and will be important in
the future,'' Dube said.
</P>
<P>
   The four distributors are Ingram Micro Inc., Tech Data Corp.,
Merisel Inc. and Inacom Corp. Each will be responsible for
maintaining its own inventories as they market and sell Compaq
products.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq predicted that the move will simplify product shipment,
improve forecasting of demand for PCs and reduce transportation
costs. Analysts cited poor forecasting when Compaq surprised Wall
Street a month ago with the warning that first-quarter earnings
would be less than half what investors expected.
</P>
<P>
   That surprise, which caused Compaq's stock price to plunge, was
seen as a contributing factor in the ouster of Pfeiffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``By streamlining our logistics, Compaq is making the business
less complex, more manageable, and more profitable for the reseller
community, which remains a key advantage of Compaq over pure direct
competitors,'' Compaq Senior Vice President Peter Blackmore said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   While it remains the top PC maker in the United States and
worldwide, Compaq has struggled for months to find the right
response to the challenge from Dell Computer Corp. Dell, which
early on recognized the Internet's potential to connect with
customers, focused on the World Wide Web and telephone sales to
avoid retailers and third-party distributors and sell directly to
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Dell was not seen as a serious threat to big
companies such as Compaq. Watching Dell in their rear-view mirrors,
competitors argued that there were limits to how far direct sales
could penetrate the mainstream markets of consumers, small
businesses and large corporate accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But Dell has consistently grown in market share while achieving
the highest profits among the major PC companies.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing directly with customers and building each PC to order
enabled Dell to charge lower prices and offer new technology faster
than Compaq, IBM Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co., the other members
of the top tier of companies. At the same time, Dell avoided a
build-up of unsold PCs, which lose value daily as component costs
decline and new technology becomes available at a steady pace.
</P>
<P>
   Like Compaq, IBM and H-P have copied some aspects of Dell's
direct sales model.
</P>
<P>
   Dube said he believes Compaq may reduce Dell's advantage by
concentrating on only four distributors, and that IBM and H-P may
follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will ratchet up competition for Dell,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst warned the move to streamline its distribution
system carries risks for Compaq if it angers other distributors who
once accounted for a significant amount of business. ``They are
potentially going to alienate a number of partners that are going
to be forced to deal with these . . . master distributors,'' said
Robert Anastasi of Robertson Humphrey, an Atlanta securities firm.

LIKE IT OR NOT, TUINEI'S DEATH FURTHER MARS COWBOYS' IMAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To a world already accustomed to tsk-tsking about Jerry Jones
and the Cowboys, nothing in today's toxicology report will likely
come as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Jones. Cowboys. Drugs. Headlines.
</P>
<P>
   To the rest of the world, it won't matter that the Mark Tuinei
we knew wasn't about heroin or designer drugs. It won't matter that
a lot of us will remember Tuinei not for his death, but for the way
he seemed to embrace his life.
</P>
<P>
   It won't even matter that Tui had retired and, hence, his
behavior was incapable of affecting anything that happened to the
Cowboys on the field.
</P>
<P>
   To be accurate, Tuinei wasn't even a Jones-era Cowboy. He was
signed as a free agent during Tom Landry's watch, for what that's
worth.
</P>
<P>
   But you watch. Owner Jones will be blamed. The world will
tsk-tsk. And the Cowboys' proud image will take another blow to the
gut.
</P>
<P>
   Crass as those reactions seem, none of them would be out of
line.
</P>
<P>
   Tuinei was family. He still socialized with current Cowboys. He
worked out at Valley Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   However unfair the notion, notoriety is a two-edged sword.
Tuinei rose to football prominence as a member of the Cowboys. Now,
even in death, he can't hide from their spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Retired or active, the Cowboys are deemed to be public figures.
Very public figures. And when a public figure, at age 39, whether
he be a Cowboy or a councilman or a columnist, is found dead in his
driveway, the cameras and notepads are going to be asking why.
</P>
<P>
   This was not some spare lineman who passed through camp on his
way to NFL anonymity. This was a guy with three Super Bowl rings
and two Pro Bowl appearances whose retirement papers still bore
fresh ink.
</P>
<P>
   The media truly liked Mark Tuinei, who smiled and seemed bemused
by our daily intrusions. But that should not exempt him from the
same scrutiny that a Leon Lett, a Michael Irvin or a Deion Sanders
would certainly have to endure.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, on the marred surface, Tuinei's death impacts neither the
on-field product nor the Cowboys' depth chart. But there's a topic
for a lengthy debate.
</P>
<P>
   Tuinei's death will further soil the franchise's image. A
Cowboys team with image problems will eventually scare away a
Pepsi, a Nike or a long line of corporate underwriters. And without
the sponsor money, Owner Jones would have to rein in the signing
bonuses and salary-cap shufflings.
</P>
<P>
   If Jones wasn't worried about image, why did he fire Barry
Switzer? Why did he pass on Randy Moss?
</P>
<P>
   Jones, of course, had undertaken a mission of restoring the
luster to the Cowboys' silver star. He declared the team's most
popular hangout off-limits and fired a spare blocker who defied the
ban. He made a public show of fining and disciplining Switzer after
Coach Boomer was nabbed at the airport with a gun.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones, the maverick and wildcatter, has never himself set
any Mother Teresa example. The horses _ and the limos _ were
already out of the barn.
</P>
<P>
   Jones. Cowboys. Drugs. Headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin. Lett. Tuinei?
</P>
<P>
   To the rest of the world, right or wrong, this is the same story
with just another chapter.
</P>
<P>
   This can't be good for Lett, for whom Owner Jones seemed to be
expecting some sort of clemency.
</P>
<P>
   Nicky Sualua, who says he was with Tuinei on the fatal night, is
a backup fullback on the active roster. A third party, alleged to
be with Sualua and Tuinei last week, performs work for the Cowboys'
video department.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys. Headlines. And this time, a tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   You were about to say something, Owner Jones?
</P>
<P>
   After yesterday's TV reports, today's toxicology results are not
expected to include any pleasant news.
</P>
<P>
   Those who knew Tuinei will tell you that they are surprised.
Tui's life, as we knew it, wasn't about heroin or late-night drives
for designer drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Kind and gracious, Mark Tuinei deserves to rest in peace.
</P>
<P>
   But he was a Dallas Cowboy. The spotlight follows, even until
the end.

WRITINGS PROMPTED WARNINGS FROM LITTLETON TEACHER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs lede graf to correct attribution)   (jw) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ School district officials said Monday that the English
teacher of Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris had warned their parents
one month before their shooting attack about the violent nature of
their sons' writings at Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan Klebold's school compositions, which included descriptions
of a killing, were brought to the attention of his mother, Susan
Klebold, and of his school guidance counselor, said Marilyn
Saltzman, a spokeswoman for the Jefferson County Public Schools.
The high school senior dismissed the writing as ``just a story'' in
conversations with his counselor, whom Ms. Saltzman declined to
identify.
</P>
<P>
   An essay in which Eric Harris portrayed himself as a shotgun
shell prompted the same teacher to have a similar talk with his
father, Wayne Harris. Once the teacher learned that Harris was a
retired Air Force officer and that his son hoped to enlist in the
military, she concluded that the essay was consistent with his
future career aspirations, Ms. Saltzman said.
</P>
<P>
   A student in the class, Kevin Hofstra, recalled recently that
Eric Harris wrote about ``some strange stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One assignment was to write about an inanimate object,''
Hofstra said. ``Most people would choose a bicycle or something. He
chooses a shotgun shell and writes about his relationship with the
barrel. He often wrote about shotguns.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest video to come from the school also had elements of
foreboding. The syndicated program ``Inside Edition'' broadcast a
two-year-old video, intended to be humorous, that shows students
wearing black trench coats and carrying guns as they move through
the school's hallways. As four students walk away from Columbine,
the school explodes in orange flashes.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold did not appear in the film, which
was partly edited by Brooks Brown, a classmate who knew the pair
well. In a coincidence, another editor of the film, a 1997
Columbine graduate, is the son of Dwayne Fuselier, the lead FBI
investigator in the killings. An FBI spokesman has said that the
agency has full confidence in Fuselier, a 51-year-old psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   School officials have declined to allow interviews with the
teen-agers' English teacher or with their film teacher.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the shootings, the family of Isaiah Shoels, the
only black victim in the killings at the high school in Littleton,
Colo., has hired Geoffrey Fieger, the Michigan lawyer who won the
Jenny Jones talk show case last Friday and who was until last fall
Dr. Jack Kevorkian's lawyer. Fieger has said he may sue Jefferson
County Public Schools for negligence. Michael Shoels, Isaiah's
father, has accused a Columbine dean of ignoring a complaint he
made in early April that his son had received racist death threats
from the trench coat mafia, a school clique that included Eric
Harris and Dylan Klebold and that was noted for long black trench
coats.
</P>
<P>
   Almost three weeks since the killings in Littleton, about 80
investigators are working on the case, evaluating about 10,000
pieces of evidence, 1,800 tips and 1,300 interviews.
</P>
<P>
   In the only arrest so far, Mark Manes, a 22-year-old neighbor of
the gunmen was formally charged Monday with providing a minor with
the handgun used in the shootings. According to the police, Manes
supplied one of the boys on Jan. 23 with a Tec-DC9 assault pistol.
</P>
<P>
   Searching for clues and confederates of the two gunmen,
investigators have also submitted a friend of the pair to a lie
detector test and have scoured the park areas of Eric Harris'
neighborhood for the remains of old pipe bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks Brown, a neighbor of the Harrises, has said that the pair
used to set off bombs in the neighborhood. Employees at a Blackjack
Pizza delivery outlet, where the young gunmen worked, have said
that on one occasion in the past year Eric Harris displayed a pipe
bomb to co-workers at the store. He was on juvenile probation at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   New evidence has emerged that, in the minutes before their
attack on Columbine, the gunmen used timers to set off two
diversionary bombs, one four miles away, the other two miles away.
The goal apparently was to confuse and delay police and fire
workers responding to emergency calls from the high school.
</P>
<P>
   Each bomb, disguised in a backpack, was based on two 16-ounce
camp-stove-size propane tanks. Passers-by have said that one of the
bombs sent up two successive fireballs, each 40 feet high and seven
feet in diameter. The gunmen had less luck with a 25-pound propane
bomb in the school kitchen. Judging by a pattern of bullet holes in
the kitchen wall and from a security videotape recovered from the
cafeteria, investigators believe that, when this bomb failed to
detonate, the frustrated attackers repeatedly shot at the propane
tank.
</P>
<P>
   Still shocked by the attack, Columbine students and their
families received several morale boosters in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, in an event closed to the news media and
billed ``Columbine Surprise Party,'' players from two of Denver's
professional teams, the Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos and the
Colorado Rockies baseball team, mingled with 1,500 Columbine
students and family members at a nearby high school, signing
autographs and eating pizza.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Shania Twain, a country singer who was in Denver for
a concert, visited the five Columbine students who remained
hospitalized. On May 20, the one-month anniversary of the killings,
President Clinton is scheduled to visit, the White House announced
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, dozens of volunteers started dismantling a shrine
covering the size of a football field in a park adjoining Columbine
High School. On Sunday, for the second time, votive candles sparked
a fire, which consumed a canopy tent, floral bouquets, scraps of
poetry and stuffed teddy bears.

   DETROIT _ If Jeff Weaver and Gabe Kapler believed those who
evaluated their baseball talents, they might be pumping gas
somewhere or flipping hamburgers.
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't, and now Weaver, 22, and Kapler, 23, are two
bright young stars playing for the Detroit Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver, a 1994 graduate of Simi Valley High in California's
Ventura County, is 3-2 with a 2.48 ERA in five starts. Kapler, a
1993 graduate of Taft High in L.A.'s San Fernando Valley, is
hitting .262 with three homers and nine RBI as the starting center
fielder. But the fact Weaver and Kapler are in the big leagues at
all says more than any numbers can.
</P>
<P>
   Take Kapler, who admittedly needed a wake-up call to realize his
potential. He earned a baseball scholarship to Cal State Fullerton
after finishing up at Taft, but he didn't stay there long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically blew it,'' said Kapler, who stands 6-foot-2,
weighs 209 pounds and is an avid body-builder. ``I didn't go to
class, I didn't work hard and I partied way too much. They politely
asked me to leave. It woke me up. It got me to change my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapler ended up at Moorpark College. After one year there he was
a 57th-round draft pick of the Tigers in 1995. Players drafted in
the 57th round usually don't last long, but Kapler made an
impression on Tigers manager Larry Parrish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Jamestown, New York (the Tigers' short-season
Single-A team), to look at some other players,'' Parrish said. ``I
saw six games and I could tell he was a player. I don't know how he
got missed (in the draft). I saw him play a week and he was the
best player on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapler took it from there. After productive seasons in the
minors in 1996 and '97, he put up huge numbers last season. He hit
.322 with 28 homers and 146 RBI for Double-A Jacksonville and was
named the Minor League Player of the Year by USA Today, Baseball
Weekly and The Sporting News.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Weaver had embarked on his own journey to the big
time. He played on the junior varsity team at Simi Valley during
his sophomore year but was discouraged enough to skip baseball
altogether as a junior.
</P>
<P>
   Then, it happened. Between his junior and senior years, Weaver
grew from 5-foot-10 to 6-3. He played his senior season on the
varsity but pitched only 192/3 innings, serving as the team's
closer.
</P>
<P>
   He received no college offers to play but had good enough grades
to go to Fresno State, where he majored in physical therapy. He
made Fresno State's club as a walk-on and manager Bob Bennett
turned him into a pitcher _ one good enough to make the 1996
Olympic team and strike out an NCAA-postseason record 21 against
Texas A&AMP;M in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really was a late bloomer,'' said Weaver, who is now 6-5,
200 pounds. ``I started to grow into my body my senior year in high
school, and in college I started gaining strength. . . . When I
showed up at college I was really raw. I wasn't a pitcher, just a
thrower. And coach Bennett is all about mechanics. He made me into
a pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver was a first-round pick (14th selection overall) of the
Tigers last June and made five starts at Single-A last summer. He
began this season at Triple-A Toledo. After only one start, the
Tigers called him up.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where Weaver and Kapler's paths crossed. In order to
make room for Weaver on the 25-man roster, the Tigers sent Kapler,
who had made the team out of spring training, back to the minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still trying to recover from everything emotionally,''
Kapler said. ``It's going to take awhile to get comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   He can breathe a little easier now. On April 29, the Tigers
traded center fielder Brian Hunter to the Mariners, opening the
door for Kapler as the everyday starter in center.
</P>
<P>
   Now, both are in the big leagues. And both, it seems, are there
to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, they have the physical tools, but what we really
like _ and you could see it in the both of them in spring training
_ is they weren't intimidated when they walked on the field,''
Parrish said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they still had respect for the game at the same time. A
lot of guys are either too cocky or they don't feel they belong.
These guys knew it wasn't going to be easy, but they also felt they
could play here.''
</P>
<P>
   How is it possible? How can a 57th-round pick and a mediocre
high school player reach the big leagues? And do it so quickly?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good question,'' Kapler said. ``A lot of hard work. A
lot of not believing what people were saying about you. I think I
still have a lot of doubters, especially in the Valley. I have a
lot of doubters, but now I think I have a lot of believers, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep in touch with a lot of my friends back home,'' Weaver
said. ``We laugh about it, talking about where I was five years ago
and where I am now.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver and Kapler never faced each other in high school, but
they are impressed with each other now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Weav's biggest fan,'' Kapler said. ``He's such a stud.
He's going to be an incredible force in this game for years to
come. He's such a tough competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone here has been awesome,'' Weaver said. ``They've made
me feel comfortable, which has made it that much easier. I don't
feel I have to prove myself.''

FBI IS CRITICIZED AT HEARINGS ABOUT FLIGHT 800 CRASH
</HEADLINE>
 
(Subs 5th graf to correct date of crash)  (ms) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Some government experts who worked on the
investigation of the explosion of TWA Flight 800 told senators
Monday that the FBI had ignored them, mishandled evidence and
suppressed their conclusions. But the FBI agent who had been in
charge of the inquiry denounced the congressional proceeding as ``a
kangaroo court.''
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses told an oversight subcommittee of the Senate
Judiciary Committee Monday that James K. Kallstrom, the agent in
charge of the FBI's New York office, withheld a report written by
another agency, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, that
said that the center fuel tank of the 747 had exploded, apparently
for mechanical reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, the chairman of the subcommittee, said
that ``FBI leadership, in the case of TWA Flight 800, was a
disaster.'' He said the bureau, with a blind fixation on finding
evidence of a bomb or missile, lacked the skills necessary to
investigate a plane crash, and, more disturbingly, the ability to
coordinate with others.
</P>
<P>
   Kallstrom, in a telephone interview, sharply criticized the
hearings and said he was sorry he had not been allowed to testify.
He said his exhaustive hunt for clues of a possible terrorist
attack had fulfilled his promise to the families of the 230 people
who died, and to the public.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that at the time of the crash, July 17, 1996, a
bomb had just exploded at a park in Atlanta, where the Olympics
were beginning, and a terrorist, Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, was on trial
in a plot to blow up American jets over the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley's press secretary, Jill Kozney, said the committee had
asked the FBI for Kallstrom's testimony a week and a half ago, but
that the FBI had said Kallstrom would not be available because he
was giving a commencement speech Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A key matter of disagreement among investigators is the status
of a report prepared by fire and explosion experts from the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, known as ATF, that concluded that
the TWA explosion appeared to be caused by a mechanical flaw in the
center fuel tank. The FBI, in response to a subcommittee request,
produced a March 1997 cover letter from Kallstrom to James E. Hall,
the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, that it
said was transmitted with the report. But the letter is not signed,
and Senator Grassley expressed doubt that it had ever been sent.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials testifying Monday said it had, and Kallstrom said
he had forwarded the report within a day or two of receiving it.
</P>
<P>
   Safety board officials say they have no record of having
formally received the report, although they acknowledge having got
a copy ``over the transom.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the cover letter was hardly generous to the experts
who prepared the report. It said, ``The publication of this
unsolicited and premature report by the ATF violates the agreement
made by them regarding their participation in this investigation.''
It was, the cover letter said, ``an extraordinary violation of
investigative protocol.''
</P>
<P>
   Kallstrom, now an executive with a bank in Delaware, said
Monday, ``The only problem I had with the report was we weren't
done with the investigation; we were nowhere near finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``The center fuel tank blew up, we all agreed with that,'' he
said. ``To reach the conclusion that it was not criminal, with tons
of wreckage still in the water, after we gave our word to victims'
families that we were going to do everything possible, well, we
weren't at 70 percent of doing everything possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Grassley said the FBI's reluctance to give up on the bomb or
missile theories had made it hard for the safety board to persuade
the Federal Aviation Administration to take corrective steps, but
safety board officials were not clear on that point.
</P>
<P>
   Three investigators testified that they were sometimes shoved
aside by the FBI, and they criticized the bureau's approach to the
case. A safety board metallurgist, Frank Zakar, said the bomb or
missile idea was ``dominant from the very beginning'' with the FBI
</P>
<P>
   But two FBI officials who testified said the investigation had
gone so well that it was a model for the future. Donald M. Kerr,
the assistant director of the FBI laboratory division, said that
the ATF report could have turned into a problem if a terrorism
suspect had been arrested, because a defense lawyer could have used
it to cast doubt on a prosecutor's argument.

SPORTS COLUMN: KNICKS FIND ELBOW ROOM WITH DUDLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: SUBS throughout to UPDATE with Monday's Heat win; with
BKN-KNICKS-HEAT.) 
 (ms) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In the wake of a 10-point loss Monday night, the Knicks'
locker room was an interesting dichotomy of perspectives regarding
what the loss really meant. The scorers _ Latrell Sprewell, Allan
Houston, Marcus Camby _ were talking about intensity and needing to
be more aggressive. The point guard, Charlie Ward, was talking
about patience and trust.
</P>
<P>
   This was the aftermath of Game 2, a winnable game the Knicks had
lost to the Miami Heat, 83-73. Now they go back to New York, the
best-of-five-game series tied at a game each, and on the surface
the Knicks' mission was accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, we wanted to at least get one and we did that,''
Sprewell said. ``If you had told me before it started we were going
to get one down here, I wouldn't turn that down. I'd much rather be
going home 1-1 than 0-2. We got the one, we have the chance to
finish it at home. We just need to take care of that first game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heat, with visions of a humiliating sweep clearly before
them, came out Monday night at a blistering pace, attacked the
Knicks' middle, drove the ball at every opportunity and put the
Knicks on their heels.
</P>
<P>
   The smooth coordination of Saturday's game, with Sprewell,
Houston and Larry Johnson playing like a tight, well-rehearsed
trio, gave way to a succession of solos that seemed disconnected
from the theme. They were a combined 14 of 35 shooting _ Johnson
made six of 13 shots, Houston four of 13 and Sprewell four of nine.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday the Knicks routed the Heat and played as if they had
figured out the world. Last night they looked like a team at the
beginning of a transition.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell said there was nothing to be alarmed about.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the nature of this game,'' he said. ``You're going
to have nights when you come in and everything's perfect, other
nights when you can't seem to do anything right, and there's some
stuff in between there. You just have to get a feel for what's
going on and make adjustments as you go along.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell added: ``I'm not going to say we didn't come out ready
to play. I thought we were ready, they just got off to a better
start. We didn't shoot the ball as well as we did in Game 1; they
shot a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby, who scored 5 points in 16 minutes, said the difference
was distribution. ``In the first half we only had five assists and
ended up with 11 for the game. We definitely have to pass the ball
more.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Camby's second playoff game _ a far cry from the first
on Saturday, when he played so fluidly. ``I didn't think it was any
different,'' he said. ``It was just as intense. We just weren't
playing unselfish ball. On Saturday the ball was swinging, guys
were getting high percentage shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately there were no Knick answers. Not Muscle. Not Finesse.
And whatever hope there was provided by Patrick Ewing _ no new
light shed there. Ewing scored 9 points in the first half, and
finished with 16.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive juggernaut unleashed on Saturday _ Houston, Camby
and Sprewell _ was derailed for the evening. For at least a day,
things were back to normal. Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy all but
predicted this loss for the last two days. Predicted that the Heat
wouldn't shoot as terribly as they did on Saturday and the Knicks
might not play as well, or at last with the same degree of
intensity as they did on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   They cut it to seven, then to four, but never could get lower
that eight down the stretch. The Heat, showing neither fear nor
respect of the middle, drove the ball relentlessly. They left it up
to the Knicks point guard _ Ward and Childs _ to beat them. They
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   No. This loss isn't the end of the series. The Knicks got what
they wanted, a split on the road. But there still is no resolution
about style of play. In fact the loss is likely to stir dialogue
anew regarding whether the Knicks are on the right path. Sprewell
and Houston, so lethal on Saturday, when they scored 44 points
between them, scored 27 on Monday and turned the ball over 10
times.
</P>
<P>
   Houston said the Knicks' problem was lack of aggressiveness.
``They just came out a lot harder than we did, and they played a
lot more aggressively than we did,'' he said. ``We've got to get
that aggressiveness back.''
</P>
<P>
   In Wards's view, the Knicks' aggressiveness was not the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we play well, we play together,'' he said. ``When we
don't play well we go back to individual basketball, trying to do
it by ourselves. We have scorers _ that's a scorer's mentality, but
it's all about patience. Passing is about trust; when we don't play
well, we go back to individual basketball, trying to do it by
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Between Saturday and last night, the Knicks were like two teams
in one _ one fluid, agile, graceful and the other uncohesive,
individual and lacking any semblance of muscle.
</P>
<P>
   The question raised Monday night is do the Knicks have enough
offense? If not, do they have enough muscle?
