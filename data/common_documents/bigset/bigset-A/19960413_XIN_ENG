<HEADLINE> Ceasefire Agreed Upon In Monrovia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Factions fighting in the Liberian
capital of Monrovia since a week ago have agreed upon a ceasefire
after US helicopters ferried more than 1,000 foreigners out of
the country, a report reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Ghana's Deputy Foreign Minister Mohamed
Ibn Chambas late yesterday following negotiations which also
involved the United Nations, aid agencies and the high command of
the peacekeeping force ECOMOG, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"An immediate ceasefire has been agreed among the combatants,"
Chambas was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Chambas, Liberia's ruling council had also agreed
that ECOMOG should cordon off the Barclay Training Center
barracks, the target of shelling since fighting broke out a week
ago when the government armed police tried to arrest Krahn
militia warlord General Roosevelt Johnson on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
Chambas said Johnson had agreed to cooperate fully in
implementing the new truce agreement.
</P>
<P>
The ceasefire agreement was seen as a result of the mediation
team sent on Thursday by Ghana's President Jerry Rawlings who
helped broker the peace accord signed last August in Nigeria. The
peace accord has been derailed by the renewed violence.
</P>
<P>
After a week's fighting, looting and anarchy has been
widespread in Monrovia, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"No one knows what is going to happen to the civilian
population. People (gunmen) are going around drunk or drugged.
It's a big jungle there," the report quoted Roland Waver,
spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross, as
saying in Geneva.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Libya Condemn Israeli Attacks on S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani and Libyan Leader Muammar al-Gaddafi today jointly
condemned Israeli attacks in south Lebanon during their
telephone conversation.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that Rafsanjani
attacked Israel's brutal and merciless killings of innocent
Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
He severely criticized the international fora and countries,
which staunchly advocated so-called human rights, for maintaining
a continued silence towards the blatant aggression on Lebanon,
the report added.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani was quoted as saying that certain Islamic and
Arab states do not show sufficient interest in trying to find
a common strategy to challenge the aggressive policies of the
occupying Israeli regime.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for a joint action by the Islamic
states to defend the rights of the suppressed people of
Lebanon and Palestine and deal effectively with the Israeli
adventurism.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi said in a telephone call that the recent Israeli
aggression is based on state terrorism supported by the
U.S. in the region and that the practice of state terrorism
by the Zionists recognizes neither borders nor limitations.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan leader was quoted as saying that the silence of the
international fora and community, the indifference of the regional
 states are the outcome of Sharm El-Sheikh summit held last month
in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi hoped that the Islamic states need to adopt a firm and
independent policy in line with Islam alongside Iran.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israel Continues Aggressions against South Lebanon (Part II) (by Shao Jie) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hariri and Boueiz left Beirut after they had their second
meeting in a few hours with President Elias Hrawi. House Speaker
Nabih Berri attended the first meeting in the Beirut presidential
Palace this morning.
</P>
<P>
Before the second meeting in the Presidential Palace, the
foreign minister announced that he had made contact with Lebanese
representative in the United Nations, Samir Mubarak, on lodging a
complaint with the Security Council against the Israeli agressions.
</P>
<P>
He said he had also held contact with Lebanese representative
in the Arab league, Hisham Damashqia, and instructed him to ask an
urgent session of the Arab League in order to put an end to the
Israeli agressions against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said that contacts with Lebanese envoys to other
countries were being intensively conducted.
</P>
<P>
He added that he would call meetings today and Sunday of
diplomatic envoys of the five permanent member states of the
U.N. Security Council, member states of the European Union and the
Arab League and other countries in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had also held contacts with French Foreign
Minister Herve De Charette and Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa, and briefed them the real situation in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz announced earlier, after the first meeting with
Lebanon's three top leaders, that his country had decided to lodge
a complaint with the U.N. Security Council against Israel's
continuous agressions.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon made the decision when Israel was continuing air raids
and bombardments at southern Lebanese villages .
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said he believes that the United States
would use its "veto" right on holding a meeting of the Security
Council, or on any resolution the council could adopt.
</P>
<P>
"But we should hold the Security Council its responsibility,
and We will never accept a current logic that the (Israeli)
agressions contribute to consolidating the peace process," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no justifications at all for the Israeli attacks at
Lebanon and its agressions against Lebanon's territories and
people," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that contacts and coordinations were "continuing with
a number of countries in a purpose to put an end to the Israeli
agressions, and to prevent any (Israeli) candidate from
benefiting from these mistakes in the (upcoming Israeli)
elections."

<HEADLINE> Ramaphosa To Help Black Business Drive: Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Constitutional Assembly
Chairman Cyril Ramaphosa was the best man to spearhead a
government endorsed drive aimed at black business empowerment,
President Nelson Mandela said today.
</P>
<P>
Mandela made the remarks at his official Cape Town residence
after the announcement that Ramaphosa would soon quit parliament
and take up a position as senior executive in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Ramaphosa, a former trade unionist, would reportedly join top
black entrepreneur Dr. Nthato Motlana's New Africa Investment
Ltd. (NAIL).
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at a press conference, Mandela said the
government wanted to ensure that the wide gap between white and
black business was closed.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said big business was by definition white, while
blacks, including colored and Indians, were confined to small
and medium-sized business.
</P>
<P>
"We want the economy to be improved and it cannot be improved
if this wide gap still exists," said the president.
</P>
<P>
To this end, no one was better qualified to achieve this than
Ramaphosa, who is also Secretary-general of the African National
Congress, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Mandela said Ramaphosa's new position within the
NAIL, though to be announced soon, would only come into effect
once the final constitution was finalized.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ramaphosa, said he had chosen NAIL because it was
one of the largest black companies involved in strategic
investments and which would use this to assist with black
empowerment.
</P>
<P>
"NAIL is well placed to assist people like myself to assist
in the role we'd like to play," said Ramaphosa.
</P>
<P>
Motlana, who was also present when Mandela made the
announcement, said although blacks had "won the political
battle, real power is economic."
</P>
<P>
"We need to mobilize young men as able as Cyril Ramaphosa, who
can help to economically empower black people" said Motlana.
</P>
<P>
NAIL and the National Union of Mineworkers are part of a black
consortium who are attempting to buy out Johannesburg
Consolidated Investment subsidiary JOHNNIC.
</P>
<P>
JOHNNIC is the parent company of Times Media Limited which
owns publications like the Financial Mail and Business Day.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's former Posts
and Telecommunications Minister Pallo Jordan was one of the most
capable leaders of the African National Congress, and could not
simply be thrown out into the streets, President Nelson Mandela
said today.
</P>
<P>
Mandela made the remarks at his official Cape Town residence.
Jordan was dismissed from the cabinet post in a cabinet reshuffle
announced by Mandela on March 28.
</P>
<P>
The president, who met Jordan on Friday, said his discussions
with Jordan about the future assignment were still "a very
sensitive matter".
</P>
<P>
However, agreement on Jordan's new assignment had yet to be
reached, Mandela said, adding "until we are able to reach some
agreement on his future assignment, it will be premature for me
to comment."
</P>
<P>
The president's office said yesterday in a statement the
meeting was one of "a series of private discussions to explore
various options regarding Jordan's new area of deployment".
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime Pallo Jordan will continue serving as a
member of parliament," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
However, Jordan declined to comment on his political future
after the discussions with Mandela.

PARIS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China's Vice Premier and Foreign

three-day visit to broaden cooperation between China and the
Balkan republic.
</P>
<P>
Since setting up diplomatic relations in 1993, the two

<P>
The Chinese government also sent several cultural and economic
delegations to the former Yugoslav republic, paving the way for
future cooperation.
</P>
<P>
However, bilateral trade between the two countries has not been
fully promoted because the Macedonian economy was seriously
affected by international sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who accompanied Premier Li Peng to France, will also
visit Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan and the Czech Republic.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Law Priority in Fighting Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said here today that it must be a top law enforcement priority for
the United States to fight against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In a radio message tape recorded Friday, Clinton warned that
terrorism had entered a technologically sophisticated "new era"
with open borders and simple means of travel.
</P>
<P>
He said that he wants anti-terrorism legislation that stops
terrorist groups from raising money in the United States, as well
as deportation laws for foreigners connected with terrorist
activities.
</P>
<P>
The president made the statement just a few days before the
one-year anniversary of the April 19 explosion that left 158 dead
in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
He blamed House Republicans for stalling his proposed
anti-terrorism bill under pressure from the gun lobby.
</P>
<P>
"Under pressure from the Washington gun lobby, House
Republicans took that bill apart, piece by piece," Clinton said,
adding that "it's time to put it back together."

<HEADLINE> Moscow's Envoy Fails to Meet Dudayev </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Fighting and bad weather in
Chechnya blocked face to face talks between Moscow's peace envoy
and Chechen separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev, Itar-Tass news
agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
But Rafael Khakimov, adviser to Moscow-appointed mediator
Tatar President Mintimer Shaimiyev, said talks with Dudayev's
personal aide Vagap Tutakov were a "positive step and evident
advancement."
</P>
<P>
Khakimov said his planned meeting with Dudayev had not taken
place due to "the fighting and rains that had made roads in
Chechnya impassable."
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Tutakov, member of a contact group
preparing for negotiations between Moscow and Dudayev mediated by
Shaimiyev, Khakimov said, "It is not easy to speak with them (the
separatists), there are a number of problems, but I see the
prospects," the envoy said.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass reported that the rebels "did not refuse in principle
Tatar President Shaimiyev's mediating in negotiations with Moscow."
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin announced on March 31 a plan
for the peaceful settlement of the 16-month Chechen war which
included talks with Dudayev.

<HEADLINE> Israel Continues Attacking Hezbollah Targets in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli army today continued
air strikes against Hezbollah targets in the towns and villages in
southern Lebanon, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the Israeli army helicopters attacked a number
of Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon, while the Israeli
army artilleries increased their shelling on villages that provided
shelters to Hezbollah gunmen.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Lebanon said that two people were killed and
another wounded this afternoon when an Israeli helicopter
rocketed an ambulance in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, an Israeli army spokesman announced that an Israeli
helicopter bombed a car belonging to a Hezbollah activist in
the Lebanese village of Hiniya, and it appeared that the
Hezbollah activist was wounded.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army said earlier that it would fire at every
suspicious vehicle traveling in southern Lebanon, and warned
people not to use the main coastal road linking southern
Lebanon to Beirut, capital of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During the day, bad weather hampered Israeli air strikes
against Hezbollah targets, as a heavy fog over northern Israel
and southern Lebanon severely restricted visibility.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army today once again called on residents of the
town and villages in southern Lebanon to leave the area by 4:15
p.m. local time (1315GMT), so as to avoid further civilian
casualties.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lebanese Radio reported that the Israeli Navy has
imposed a blockade around Beirut's harbor since 4:00 a.m.
(0100GMT) this morning, with its warships stopping ships
from entering all ports from Tyre to Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Israeli airplane also flew over Beirut this afternoon, and
the Lebanese authorities warned residents of the possibility of
new Israeli attacks on the southern suburb of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Reports indicated that about 20 people have been killed and
more than 40 others wounded in the Israeli military operation
against Hezbollah, which started Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, meanwhile, has been reporting of Katyusha rocket
attacks against northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
A senior Lebanese official said that more than 200,000
Lebanese residents have fled towns and villages in the
southern part of the country to escape the Israeli military
operation.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Lebanon, the Lebanese government has
formally requested the U.N. to launch international operation to
get humanitarian assistance for the Lebanese displaced.

<HEADLINE> Barak Plays Down Significance of Diplomatic Initiatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Ehud Barak
stated today that Israel does not attach great significance to
diplomatic activities at this stage of the Lebanese war, reported
Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
"Now that our guns and aircraft are hitting Hezbollah, I
believe that time will come for diplomatic contacts only when the
government in Beirut realizes its responsibility to take over
Hezbollah," said Barak, the former chief of general staff who
directed the 1993 Operation Accountability in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, Barak will leave for Washington Monday for talks with
top American officials and, possibly, other officials from the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Barak told the radio that he had already had contacts with
European foreign ministers, U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher and his counterparts of the Israel's neighboring
states.
</P>
<P>
"Basically, it is an exchange of information about what is
going on," he said.
</P>
<P>
He denied pressure from the international community for halting
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Barak, widely regarded as a hawk in the Labor Party, said that
every effort had been made to avoid hurting civilian populations
in Lebanon, but Israel cannot fully guarantee that no civilians
are victimized. He holds the Lebanese government responsible for
any civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli foreign minister said that it would be "quite good"
if Israel keeps tranquility in the north for more than two years
up till 1999 by relentlessly countering Hezbollah this
time.

MOSCOW, April 13 (Xinhua) -- A Russian general was today
appointed as Chechnya's new prime minister by the Moscow-backed
Chechen government, reports reaching Moscow said.
</P>
<P>
The appointment of Lieutenant-General Nikolai Koshman is aimed

population, said the Chechen republic's leader and former prime
minister Doku Zavgayev.

<P>
Before Koshman's appointment, the Moscow-backed Chechen
government consisted only of ethnic Chechens.

Koshman was formerly deputy head of Russia's Railway Troops and
an adviser to Oleg Lobov, the Russian presidential envoy in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Zavgayev won controversial elections in Chechnya last December
which were boycotted by separatists loyal to rebel leader Dzhokhar

<HEADLINE> Filipinos Start to Construct Subic Techno-Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines today started to
construct the Subic Techno-Park (STEP) with President Fidel Ramos
attending the groundbreaking ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The 50-hectare industrial estate is a joint project of the
Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA), Japan International
Development Organization (JAIDO) and Bank of Tokyo with an
investment of 22 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the president described the venture as "another
bold step toward 'Philippines 2000'."
</P>
<P>
According to Ramos, approximately 50 supporting industry
companies will set up facilities in the Subic Bay and generate
about 10,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
The STEP is intended for the country's small and medium
enterprises (SMES). The promotion of SMES in Subic will in turn
encourage the development of supporting industries in the
Philippines through technology transfer, the president said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his appreciation to the Japanese investors for
choosing the Philippines in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The development of the industrial estate further boosts the
freeport's bid to become a major investment destination in the
Asia-Pacific region, Ramos said.

<HEADLINE> More Air Traffic For Inland Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Air traffic has grown rapidly in
the southwest province of Guizhou in recent years, with 26 routes
now opened between this provincial capital and other Chinese
cities and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Guiyang airport receives over 30 regular and charter
flights and handles about 2,500 passengers each day.
</P>
<P>
Located in China's hinterland, Guizhou used to have only a few
air connections with some other inland cities.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990 the provincial civil aviation authorities have
invested 88 million yuan in the renovation and the expansion of
airport facilities and other services.
</P>
<P>
These projects included renovation and expansion of the runway
and parking apron, and decoration and expansion of the terminal
building and an airport hotel, construction of a navigation tower,
improvement of its lighting system for night flights, and
installation of 400 lines of program-controlled telephones.
</P>
<P>
Newly established services include a computerized ticket
reservation system that is connected with other systems
nationwide, consignment of cargoes for international transport,
express mail, and so on.
</P>
<P>
With improved infrastructure, annual passenger and cargo flows
at the Guiyang airport have risen 30 percent and 20 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The airport opened charter flights to Hong Kong, the first
destination for its routes outside the Chinese mainland, in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Last year the airport handled 9,600 flights, three times the
number in 1990, 850,000 passengers and 9,000 tons of cargo and
mail.
</P>
<P>
To boost its air traffic, a second airport with a total
investment over one billion yuan is being built in the city, and
is scheduled to go into operation next year.
</P>
<P>
Then air passenger and cargo flows to and from Guiyang are
expected to increase by some 60 percent.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: PC Selection Committee Panel Holds Advice-Seeking Meetings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Selection Committee Panel
of the Preparatory Committee (PC) of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) held eight meetings here today to
seek advice from Hong Kong people on the methods of producing
Selection Committee members.
</P>
<P>
About 400 delegates from over 160 associations and
organizations attended today's meetings, including chambers of
commerce, associations of trade, tourism and banks, accounting and
labor agencies, trade unions, grass-root societies and district
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Vice-chairmen of the Preparatory Committee Lu Ping, Zhou Nan,
Tung Chee-hwa and Li Fook-sean were present at some of the
meetings.
</P>
<P>
During the consultations, delegates were active at voicing
their suggestions on the qualification and representativeness of
the members of the Selection Committee which is to be responsible
for selecting first chief executive and provisional legislative
council.
</P>
<P>
Some of the delegates elaborated on the general principle for
choosing Selection Committee members while others presented their
concrete views on the subject. Many of them handed over their
written suggestions after their speeches.
</P>
<P>
Most of the speakers at the meetings claimed that the members
of the Selection Committee must support the Basic Law and endorse
the related decisions made by the HKSAR Preparatory Committee,
adding that it should be set as a basic condition for the
qualification of the members.
</P>
<P>
Some of the delegates stressed the Selection Committee should
embody broader representativeness which finds manifestation in
adhering to the fundamental and long-term interests of Hong Kong
citizens, the principle of "one country, two systems" and "Hong
Kong people running Hong Kong," and efforts to promote Hong
Kong's smooth transition, long-term prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
They called for taking into account the interests of various
sectors and layers so that the Selection Committee could
represent the will of the masses of Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
Chui Kwok Kan, chairman of Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway Staff
General Association, said that he and his fellow staff stood for
setting it a basic condition to support the Basic Law and the
establishment of the Provisional Legislative Council for choosing
Selection Committee members.
</P>
<P>
Tsang Hin-chi, PC member and chairman of the Chinese General
Chamber of Commerce, said that the advice-seeking program in Hong
Kong is significant to PC's work in the coming months as well as
helpful to the formation of the Selection Committee.
</P>
<P>
Tsui Sze-min, PC member and publisher of the monthly Mirror
magazine, said that the advice-seeking meetings will promote the
exchanges between the preparatory committee and the Hong Kong
residents.
</P>
<P>
He said that absorbing advice from various sectors will bring
Hong Kong people's wisdom to full play in the preparatory work for
the establishment of the HKSAR.

<HEADLINE> China to Develop High-Quality Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China will focus on developing
high-quality housing in the next five years, to attain the goal of
14 sq m of living area for each person at the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
China will build 1.2 billion sq m of housing between 1996 and
2000, and renovate 40 million sq m of dilapidated houses.
</P>
<P>
The figures were released by the Ministry of Construction at a
national conference on construction planning, which was concluded
Friday in this capital city of south China's Hainan Province.
</P>
<P>
Construction of housing for ordinary families is of more
importance to China than development of commercial mansions and
villas, said an official with the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Having one of the world's fastest-growing economies, China has
been swept by a real estate craze with the rising demand for
business buildings in recent years, manifested by the mushrooming
highrises in big cities and luxurious villas in scenic areas.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, many ordinary Chinese are still plagued with
the problem of a lack of proper housing, especially in big
cities. For many Chinese, a proper house is their biggest lifelong
ambition.
</P>
<P>
Realizing the significance of ordinary housing, China's
policy-makers have taken macro-economic control measures to cool
down the real estate market, which has shown signs of unrestrained
and unbalanced growth since many building projects have been
driven by speculation and profiteering.
</P>
<P>
Last year's growth rate in China's real estate market was
roughly the same as in 1994, and the area of ordinary housing
development projects accounted for over 80 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Much attention should be paid to the improvement of houses'
functions and living surroundings in housing projects, said Li
Zhendong, vice-minister of construction.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Al-Hariri and Foreign Minister Fares Boueiz Left here this
afternoon for Damascus to meet Syrian leaders on continuous
Israeli aggressions in Lebanon which have entered its third
successive day.
</P>
<P>
A Syrian-Lebanese enlarged summit, which had been scheduled to
be held in Damascus today, was postponed due to the Israeli
escalations.
</P>
<P>
Hariri and Boueiz left Beirut after they had their second
meeting in few hours with President Elias Hrawi. House Speaker
Nabih Berri attended the first meeting in the Beirut Presidential
Palace this morning.
</P>
<P>
Before the second meeting in the Presidential Palace, the
foreign minister announced that he had made a contact with the
Lebanese representative in the United Nations on lodging a
complaint with the Security Council against the Israeli
aggressions.
</P>
<P>
He said he had also held a contact with the Lebanese
representative in the Arab league and instructed him to ask an
urgent session of the Arab League in order to put an end to the
Israeli aggressions against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said that contacts with Lebanese envoys to other
countries were being intensively conducted.
</P>
<P>
He added that he would call meetings today and tomorrow with
diplomatic envoys of the five permanent member states of the
U.N. Security Council, member states of the European Union and
the Arab League and other countries in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Foreign Minister Boueiz announced earlier, after the
first meeting with Lebanon's three top leaders, that his country
had decided to lodge a complaint with the U.N. Security Council
against Israel's continuous aggressions.
</P>
<P>
And Lebanon made this decision when Israel was continuing air
raids and bombardments at southern Lebanese villages.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Boueiz expected that the United States would
use its "veto" right on holding a meeting of the Security
Council, or on any resolution the council could adopt.
</P>
<P>
"But we should hold the Security Council its responsibility,
and we will never accept a current logic that the (Israeli)
aggressions contribute in consolidating the peace process," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no justifications at all for the Israeli attacks at
Lebanon and its aggressions against Lebanon's territories and
people."
</P>
<P>
Boueiz accused the Jewish state of attempting "to throw
Lebanon into confusion on the political, economic and social
levels, and to push the country to a confrontation with the
resistance movement."
</P>
<P>
He announced that he would summon in the Foreign Ministry a
meeting of representatives of Arab and International
organizations and institutions to support, socially, healthily and
 humanitarianly, the southern Lebanese villagers dispelled by the
Israeli aggressions from their houses in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
He said that contacts and coordinations were "continuing with
a number of countries in a purpose to put an end to the
Israeli aggressions, and to prevent any (Israeli) candidate from
benefitting from these mistakes in the (upcoming Israeli)
elections."

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Urges Shift in Agricultural Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Jiang
Chunyun has said that two fundamental shifts in the economic
system and economic growth mode are the key to the fulfillment of
China's agricultural development goals for the next 5-to-15 years.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made this remark during an inspection tour of the Chinese
capital from April 10 to 12.
</P>
<P>
The two shifts, namely from a centrally-planned economy to a
market one and from a quantity-oriented extensive economic growth
pattern to a quality-oriented intensive one, should be combined
organically so as to further liberalize and develop the
agricultural productive forces, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Wei Jianxing, Party secretary of Beijing, Mayor
Li Qiyan, and Agriculture Minister Liu Jiang, the vice-premier
inspected suburban Tongxian County and the Fangshan District.
</P>
<P>
In Hugezhuang Township, Tongxian County, Jiang told local
farmers that the development of greenhouse vegetables is both an
effective way for them to become prosperous and an effective
measure for the city to supply sufficient vegetables round the
year.
</P>
<P>
He also highly appraised the successful experience of three
villages in the Fangshan District in developing agriculture,
animal husbandry, forestry and rural industry in accordance with
the actual conditions of their respective areas.
</P>
<P>
On Friday afternoon Jiang was briefed on the capital's work and
achievements in promoting the "rice bag" and "vegetable basket"
projects. He said that Beijing, with a large urban area and
relatively small suburban area, has scored marked progress in
reinforcing and developing agriculture. Statistics show that last
year the capital's total rural output value and the per capita
income of farmers increased by 10 percent and 39 percent
year-on-year, respectively.
</P>
<P>
"The acceleration of the development of agriculture and the
rural economy lies in promoting the two shifts," Jiang said. "The
two shifts amount to a profound revolution, which may naturally be
challenged by the cropping up of new situations and problems."
</P>
<P>
Whether or not the problems can be overcome in time and
effectively depends on whether officials at all levels, especially
leading ones, can keep up with new developments in perception and
ideology, Jiang said, urging all rural officials to continue to
emancipate their minds.
</P>
<P>
He said that while efforts should be made to stabilize the
current household contract responsibility system, the scale of
agro-business should be increased gradually, adding that
appropriate economies of scale should be permitted in areas where
the conditions are ripe.

<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Farouq Kaddoumi, chief of the
Political Department of the Palestine Liberation Organization,
asserted the necessity of holding a new Madrid peace conference to
save the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
With an effective European and U.N. participation, such a
conference will be able to take practical measures to boost the
peace process and avoid the grave consequences that may result
from the failure of this process, he said in a statement published
today.
</P>
<P>
As for the Israeli blockade on the Palestinian self-rule areas,
Kaddomi warned that it would bring the Palestinian-Israeli peace
track to a blind alley, thus endangering the Middle East peace
process as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian official noted that the Israeli
aggression against Lebanon indicated that Israel did not want to
establish peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumi met yesterday with Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjoern
Tore Godal who was on a visit to Tunisia from April 9 to 12.
</P>
<P>
The meeting discussed the latest developments in the region in
the light of the Israeli blockade of the self-rule areas and ways
of providing support to the besieged Palestinian people through
the forthcoming conference of the donor countries in Brussels.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo stressed
that the key to the reform of state-owned enterprises is to
strengthen leadership and pay great attention to the
implementation of the reform measures by taking into consideration
the actual situations of various localities.
</P>
<P>
Wu, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China, made the remark during
his inspection tour of east China's Jiangsu Province from April 9
to 13.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier visited a series of large enterprises in
Nanjing, Yangzhou and Xuzhou, including the Panda Brand
Electronics Enterprise Group, the Yangtze Petrochemicals Corp. and
Yizheng Joint Corporation of Chemical Fiber Industry.
</P>
<P>
He noted that through years of experiments and exploration, the
country has made great headway in reforming state-owned
enterprises. And the Central Party Committee and the State Council
have set explicit policies and principles for reforming them.
</P>
<P>
Wu stressed that this year priority should be given to certain
aspects in enterprise reform: First, further liberate minds, be
bold in blazing new trails and quicken the pace of reform; and
second, strengthen leadership, step up co-operation and
coordination by easing disputes between various departments and
sectors.
</P>
<P>
He urged various localities to invigorate both large and small
enterprises and adhere to the principle of combining reform and
renovation with reinforcement of enterprise administration, and
take active and prudent steps in pushing forward annexation and
bankruptcy of enterprises and in enliving liquid assets.
</P>
<P>
As for the problems cropping up in the management of the
state-owned enterprises, the vice-premier urged the efficient
enterprises to adopt various forms and try all means to solve the
problem of circulation funds.
</P>
<P>
Wu called for various enterprises to increase economic returns
by further tapping the potentials of the existing facilities
instead of developing new projects.
</P>
<P>
He also called for earnest efforts to be made to stimulate the
transformation of economic growth modes.

<HEADLINE> India Continues Crackdown on Telephone Racket </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 13 (Xinhua) -- India's Central Bureau of
Investigation (CBI) is continuing to probe a telephone racket
involving the Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL) in the
capital, the Press Trust of India reported today.
</P>
<P>
The CBI arrested an MTNL employee, identified as Ashok Rai, who
allegedly used to obtain telephone connections using forged
documents and sell it to people at exorbitant rates, a CBI
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Rai, who masterminded the whole racket, owned a four-storey
house in south Delhi and a garment manufacturing factory besides
having three telephone connections at his residence, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
When the anti-corruption branch of CBI Delhi unit raided his
premises, he tried to escape by jumping from the roof-top to the
adjacent house but was finally nabbed.
</P>
<P>
During the raids, the CBI team found a large number of
telephone instruments besides rubber stamps and letter-heads of
fake firms in whose names the accused secured the phone
connections.
</P>
<P>
The probe carried out so far revealed that Rai had issued over
50 connections using fake documents and about 20 such connections
were at present functioning in different parts of the capital.
Three factories in the capital were also searched and unauthorized
instruments installed there seized.
</P>
<P>
The investigating agency earlier detected a massive racket
involving long distance calls in which the bills, amounting to a
total of over 1.5 crore rupees (about 430,000 US dollars), were
passed on to various MTNL subscribers in south Delhi allegedly by
some private persons with the help of some MTNL employees.

<HEADLINE> College Students Improving Their Behavior </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nanning, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Avenues now are clear of even one
piece of litter, garbage cans which used to stand
higgledy-piggledy now stand tidily along the roadsides, and in the
dining hall students are in good order for their meals.
</P>
<P>
During study time the library and all the classrooms are filled
with busy students, and there are many students still studying in
their dormitories.
</P>
<P>
The Karaoke song and dance halls in the surrounding area of the
university, which were crowed and noisy previously, now have
become very quiet, and some have even closed down.
</P>
<P>
All these are indications of a new atmosphere at Guangxi
University in this capital of southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, as a result of an anti-uncivilized behavior
campaign, starting in March last year.
</P>
<P>
A year ago, when the new semester had just begun, the Students
Affairs Section together with the Youth League of the university,
listed 25 types of uncivilized behavior to be eliminated on the
campus.
</P>
<P>
Among the forbidden behaviors, booing and hooting at
gatherings, over-intimate contact with the opposite sex, doodling
and scribbling on desks and walls, and shining mirrors at the
opposite sex's dormitories came top of the list.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, campaigns to encourage self-cultivation and
good manners among the students were also carried out.
</P>
<P>
Regular heart-to-heart talks on selected topics between the
students and university leaders, for example, drew wide interest
and won high appraise from the students.
</P>
<P>
Dong Wenfang, a junior female student in the department of
chemistry, said she believed that "these efforts will play a
guilding role in modeling the students' outlook on both world and
life".
</P>
<P>
Chen Haihui, another junior student, in the department of
international trade, said, "At the beginning I felt that my
privacy was infringed upon and objected to those strict
regulations, but as time passed I came to understand that it will
finally benefit us students by creating a better general mood and
environment for us to study."
</P>
<P>
The significance of such a campaign is also found in the job
market. "Employers judge the students' quality by the general mood
of their university, and uncivilized behavior on campus will
greatly influence the students' chances in the job market," said
senior student Liu Ying, who is currently seeking a job.
</P>
<P>
According to Liang Qiguang, deputy Party secretary of Guangxi
University, it is the university's bounden duty to stress the
moral training of students. "Without a generation of successors
with good moral, intellectual and physical education, China will
not be able to achieve its long-term goal of stability and
development", he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 13 (Xinhua) -- After nearly three decades of
efforts, India is very close to conquering iodine deficiency that
affects millions, an eminent Indian scientist said today.
</P>
<P>
India is likely to meet the World Health Organization's goal of
eliminating the deficiency by the end of the century, professor V.
Ramalingaswamy, former director-general of Indian Council of
Medical Research (ICMR), said.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a keynote address at a symposium on iodine
deficiency disorders and thyroid diseases here, professor
Ramalingaswamy said "the historic decision of the government of
India to iodize all edible salt in a phased manner in 1990 can be
said to be the watershed in controlling iodine deficiency."
</P>
<P>
The professor, now working at the famous All India Institute of
Medical Sciences (AIIMS), said iodine deficiency disorder not only
causes goiter but also affects the brain of unborn babies.
</P>
<P>
Ramalingaswamy and his colleagues at AIIMS were the first to
show that the endemic goiter in India was due to deficiency of
iodine in the soil and waters of affected areas, and not due to
genetic factors or presence of goiter-causing factors in local
diet.

SEOUL, April 13 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam said today he will do his utmost for the rest of his

<P>
Kim, leader of the ruling New Korea Party (NKP), made the

</P>
<P>
The main opposition National Congress for New Politics (NCNP)

</P>
<P>
President Kim pledged to continue to work toward national
harmony and to eradicate malpractice and corruption.
</P>
<P>
He also called on party members to make continued efforts for
reforms while maintaining stability, saying that "the (ruling)
party will have to take humble attitudes towards the election
outcome and think over what the people need."
</P>
<P>
He said any wrongdoing and illegal activities in the elections
will have to be thoroughly investigated. "Those who violated
election laws will be punished whoever they are," Kim added.
</P>
<P>
During the 16-day election campaign, which ended on April 10,
502 people were found by the Central Election Management Committee
(CEMC) to have broken election laws. Of those, 15 were referred

During telephone conversations with U.S. President Bill Clinton

responsibility.

Israel launched air attacks in southern Lebanon Friday in
retaliation for Hezbollah rocket attacks against centers of

The Lebanese government immediately asked for French
intervention following the air bombardment, according to press

<HEADLINE> EU Accused of Financing Recent Fighting in S. Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 13 (Xinhua) -- General Mohamed Farah Aidid
has accused foreigners of being involved in the recent fighting
in south Mogadishu between his supporters and those of Osman
Hassan Ali Atto.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with an African newspaper "the Hom" that Backs
his government published today, General Aidid pointed out that
Mr. Sigurd Illing, special envoy of the European Union to
Somalia, was among those involved deeply in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
The general also accused the European Union of financing the
civil war in south Mogadishu, saying, "even ordinary civilians
know how much money they have paid for refueling the fighting."
</P>
<P>
General Aidid claimed that what his political adversaries want
is to misguide the Somali people as "practised by the United
Nations and late dictator Mohamed Said Barre".
</P>
<P>
He said his government vowed to defend the Somali people from
what he called the foreign-manipulated elements who will be
"eradicated from the country very soon".
</P>
<P>
The General did not mention the name of Osman Atto but just
labelled his faction as an armed group who are "determined to
destablize the security of the capital and close the functioning
seaport of Merca so as to make the people further suffer."
</P>
<P>
This armed group has aligned themselves with the "manifesto
group", referring to Ali Mahdi's faction, which is "popular" in
what he called sympathizing with the imperialists and has "deep
hatred to the Somali sovereignty".
</P>
<P>
Speaking of his long presence in Baidoa and Bakol, Aidid who
returned to the capital last week said his tour to the Rahanwein
region was a complete success, saying the government forces have
restored law and order there and expelled 21 aid people who he
said were flinging mud at the legitimacy of his government.
</P>
<P>
He claimed the 21 aid workers he seized during his capture of
Baidoa last September, were caught attacking his government while
teaching the people of Baidoa christianity.
</P>
<P>
The relations between General Aidid and the world community
have been anything but good. The general has recently refused the
visit of a high-level delegation from the European Community to
south Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, he also banned Mr Sigurd Illing from visiting Somalia
without the consent of his government.
</P>
<P>
This is the first interview General Aidid gave to the media in
more than a year and this time he gave the interview to his
paper. He refused to meet all other journalists for reasons
unknown.

HOHHOT, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Baita (White Pagoda) Airport
in this capital city of north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous

passenger and cargo transport.
</P>
<P>
The expansion project has received approval from the Civil

chosen by the State Council as a frontier airport in 1992.
</P>
<P>
In recent years the local government has invested 200 million
yuan in upgrading airports in Hailar and Baotou as well as

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Two Chinese designers won the
championship at the Fourth Brothers Cup Young Fashion Designers
Contest, the largest international fashion contest ever held in
China, in the finals held here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Brothers Wu Xuewei and Wu Xuekan, from Heilongjiang Province,
presented an original fashion collection with the theme of
"Paper-Cut". Combining the traditional Chinese paper-cutting
patterns with smart suiting materials, their designs convey a
strong contrast between the old and new worlds. "These hand-made
garments are a reflection of the ideological dilemma all modern
people are facing," commented a fashion expert here.
</P>
<P>
Another fashion line, "Red Ladies" designed by 25-year-old
Belgian designer Vanessa Neirynck, won the second prize. The
designer said this collection is her personal vision of China. "I
have been working all in red with some touches of white and gold.
I think my inspiration is from China's red lanterns, textile
materials and the spirit of Chinese culture."
</P>
<P>
Thirty-six young designers from 17 countries and regions,
including China, Britain, France, Finland, Italy, Nigeria, Canada,
Singapore, Japan and Hong Kong, entered the finals after a
preliminary contest this morning.
</P>
<P>
The panel of judges was formed of 13 senior Chinese and foreign
fashion experts.
</P>
<P>
Li Xin, chairwoman of the selection board, said that the
contest aimed at promoting exchanges between the fashion cultures
of the East and West, and bringing more outstanding young
designers, who always enjoy less opportunities than the older
ones, into the limelight.
</P>
<P>
The annual contest received 1,132 entries from both at home and
abroad this time.

<HEADLINE> Russian Credit Bank to Open Beijing Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Credit Bank, one of
the five leading banks in Russia, is soon to open an office in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The new office is to render credit service on the basis of
equality and mutual benefit between China and the Russian
Federation to promote bilateral trade development, said the
director of the International Development Department of the bank.
</P>
<P>
The bank, founded in 1990, is a share-holding commercial bank
with branches in all the major cities in Russia. It was the only
bank to make money payment and settlement of accounts in the 15
states of the federation in the 1995-96 period. The bank has
opened offices in Britain, Sweden, Hungary, Lebanon, Bahrain and
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The world economic and financial center in the 21st Century
will move to China, which has attracted world attention with its
fast economic growth, the director said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the president of the bank expressed the wish to open
a Beijing office when Chinese Premier Li Peng visited Russia in
1995, and Li accepted the request, he said.
</P>
<P>
With enhanced co-operation among companies and enterprises
between the two countries, both sides wish to get more information
on each other's financial development, and laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
The primary task of the office is to offer information and
consultancy in these fields, the director noted.
</P>
<P>
The bank has forged close links with the Bank of China, the
Export-Import Bank of China and other leading banks, and
participated in the development of the Pudong New Area.
</P>
<P>
Financial circles in Russia attach great importance to the
forthcoming visit to China by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, he
said, adding the bank president and vice-president in charge of
the bank's Asian-Pacific affairs will be part of Yeltsin's
entourage.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Freeze Issuing of Firearms Licenses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said here today that his government has decided
to freeze the issuing of firearms licenses nationwide for an
indefinite period.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir told reporters that the decision was made by the Home
Affairs Ministry recently because too many license holders had not
been taking care of their firearms and losing them.
</P>
<P>
"We have sometimes been too lax (in issuing the licenses) and
too many people are losing their firearms. So we want to ensure
that only those who are eligible get the license," said Mahathir,
who is also minister of home affairs.
</P>
<P>
The freeze order came after Malaysian businessman Alfred Chin
was arrested in Taiwan for alleged arms smuggling last month.
Malaysian police confirmed that these arms were smuggled from the
State of Sabah, where, a report said, at least 15,000 firearms
licenses have been issued in the past.
</P>
<P>
Local reports also said some politicians might also be involved
in issuing firearms licenses and urged the authorities to make a
thorough investigation.
</P>
<P>
When asked if anyone found involved would be dealt with under
the internal security act, Mahathir said the decision would be
made only after police completed their investigation.

<HEADLINE> 2,500-year-old Tombs of Nomads Excavated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Two tombs belonging to a tribe
which roamed north China some 2,500 years ago have been unearthed
in Xinzhou City, Shanxi Province, according to the "China
Archeology News".
</P>
<P>
In one of the tombs local archaeologists found a three-layer
wooden coffin, 11 pieces of bronze ware and the remains of a
40-year-old female thought to have been buried alive with the
coffin occupant.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that it is hard to tell the sex of the coffin
occupant because the remains had decayed too much.
</P>
<P>
The system of the burial of live people along with the deceased
lasted up until the Ming Dynasty (1644-1911) in some parts of
China.
</P>
<P>
The other tomb contained three coffins. A female wearing
jewelry was buried in the middle one, while a couple and another
person lay separately on each side.
</P>
<P>
Seven pieces of bronze ware were found in the tomb.
</P>
<P>
The tombs, probably belonging to the Rong or Di nomadic tribes,
were found among a group of tombs dating back to the Spring and
Autumn Period (771-476 BC).

<HEADLINE> Jordanian-U.S. Joint Exercises Start Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Jordan announced here today the
joint Jordanian-U.S. military exercises "Eager Tiger" starts
today.
</P>
<P>
Major General Mahammed Abadneh, Chief of Staff of Royal
Jordanian Air Force, said at a press conference that 1,100
American servicemen and 34 U.S. planes arrived here Friday will
start joint military exercises with Jordanian air forces.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not give the number of Jordanian pilots who
will take part in the exercises.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here today with the Commander of
the U.S. expeditionary forces, General Bill Loony, he said the
Jordan's joint military exercises with the United States are not
new, noting that Jordan has held similar exercises with friendly
forces, including the U.S. air forces since 1991.
</P>
<P>
He added that what is new about this year's exercises is its
coincidence with the deployment of American aircraft in Jordan to
monitor the U.N. imposed "no-fly zone" over southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the surveillance flights over southern Iraq
would not be launched directly from Jordan.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that neither Jordanian pilots nor any other
air force would take part in the surveillance flights, which
had to be launched from land two months instead of Gulf-based
aircraft carriers because of the temporary absence from the
region of an aircraft during that period.
</P>
<P>
Looney said the 34 U.S. planes and 1,100 servicemen are not
in Jordan to provide support to the temporary mission, which
he said would last until sometime in June.
</P>
<P>
The planes participating in the exercises and surveillance
flights are 18 F-16s, 12 F-15s and 4 KC-135 tanker jets,
according to the daily Jordan Times today.
</P>
<P>
The American contingent, named "Airpower Expeditionary Force"
will also carry out some repairs at the air base so as to enable
the base to receive F-16s that Jordan is expected to receive this
year from the United States in line with the assistance package
between the two countries, Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti has
said.
</P>
<P>
It is widely expected that the U.S. planes will use the
airspace of Saudi Arabia to enter Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The surveillance flights are also scheduled to start today.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time Jordan allows itself to be used as a
launching base for the surveillance flights over southern Iraq
since the "no-fly zone" was declared down 32nd parallel by the
U.N. Security Council in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The "no-fly zone" aimed at protecting Shiite Moslem rebels in
southern Iraq who rose up against the Saddam regime in the wake
of the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has reiterated that the Kingdom would not be a party to
any military operations against Iraq and would not allow its
territory to be used in any strike on its east neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
The surveillance flights, Jordanian officials said, come in
line with the U.N. resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Lodge Complaint with U.N. Against Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares
Boueiz announced here this morning, after a meeting with
Lebanon's three top leaders, that his country has decided to lodge
a complaint with the U.N. Security Council against Israel's
continuous aggressions.
</P>
<P>
In the presence of the foreign minister, Lebanese President
Elias Hrawi, House Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Rafik
Al-Hariri held a meeting in the Beirut Presidential Palace this
morning, to consult on the present situations in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
And Lebanon made this decision when Israel was continuing air
raids and bombardments at southern Lebanese villages.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Boueiz announced that his country "has
decided to file a complaint with the U.N. Security Council against
the recent Israeli aggressions."
</P>
<P>
He said that he would conduct contacts with the council
members. Among the five permanent members of the Security
Council, the United States has reportedly expressed a "negative
position" on any call for a council meeting, according to an
earlier statement by Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
At the end of today's meeting of the Lebanese leaders, the
foreign minister also called for an urgent meeting of the Arab
League, in an addition to other international consultations.
</P>
<P>
He expected that the United States would use its "veto" right
on holding a meeting of the Security Council, or on any resolution
the council could adopt.
</P>
<P>
"But we should hold the Security Council its responsibility,
and we will never accept a current logic that the (Israeli)
aggressions contribute in consolidating the peace process," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no justifications at all for the Israeli attacks at
Lebanon and its aggressions against Lebanon's territories and
people."
</P>
<P>
Boueiz accused the Jewish state of attempting "to throw
Lebanon into confusion on the political, economic and social
levels, and to push the country to a confrontation with the
resistance movement."
</P>
<P>
He announced that he would summon in the Foreign Ministry a
meeting of representatives of Arab and International
organizations and institutions to support, socially, healthily and
humanitarianly, the southern Lebanese villagers dispelled by the
Israeli aggressions from their houses in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
He said that contacts and coordinations were "continuing with
a number of countries in a purpose to put an end to the Israeli
aggressions, and to prevent any (Israeli) candidate from
benefitting from these mistakes in the (upcoming Israeli)
elections."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: No Israeli Air Raids over Last Night, Bombardments Continue (by Shao Jie) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 13 (Xinhua) -- No Israeli air raids at targets in
Lebanon taken place since 10 pm (19:00 GMT) last night and until
this morning, but the Israeli forces were continuing bombarding
southern Lebanese villages.
</P>
<P>
Thunders and Lightnings have been raging in the sky over
Lebanon since last night, and a rainstorm has been poured down on
this country. Lebanese army sources saw that the bad whether
forced the Israeli forces to temporarily stop the air raids.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the south said that the Israeli forces were
continuing making reinforcements to the Israeli self-proclaimed
"security zone" in south Lebanon, and threatened to launch more
strikes at the Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
But a newest report from the south said that around 10:50 am
(7:50 GMT), Israeli warplanes launched an air raid at the
southern Lebanese villages of Haris, Zidqin and Shaitiyeh, in
which the Israeli planes launched air-to-surface missiles, but no
casualties were mentioned.
</P>
<P>
A Syrian-Lebanese enlarged summit, which had been scheduled to
be held in Damascus today, was cancelled due to the deteriorating
situations.
</P>
<P>
And Lebanon's three top leaders, namely President Elias Hrawi,
House Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Rafik Al-Hariri are
due to hold a meeting, in the presence of Foreign Minister Fares
Boueiz, today to consult on the situations.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources expected that the Lebanese leaders would
discuss the latest developments in light of the Israeli
aggressions against Lebanon, which have entered their third
successive day, and study lodging a Lebanese complaint with the
U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
And they would also review outcomes of current diplomatic
activities in a purpose to put an end to the Israeli military
escalation.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese leaders would make an assessment on results of
the diplomatic contacts on various levels, including one made by
Prime Minister Rafik Al-Hariri with French President Jacques
Chirac in which, the well-informed sources said, Chirac briefed
Hariri the former's contact with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Nabih Berri, in a statement issued today,
ironically pointed out that Israel did not need to make an excuse
by announcing a violation (by the Hezbollah) of the so-called
"July understanding," a U.S.-mediated tacit agreement which put an
end to an Israeli blitz in South Lebanon in July, 1993.
</P>
<P>
He noted that no matter whether the July understanding would
remain or collapse, Israel was determined to expand its
aggressions in Lebanon in a bid to press for the Israeli
conditions and to use Lebanon to exert more pressure upon Syria.
</P>
<P>
Under the July understanding, Israel promised to refrain from
attacking civilian targets in Lebanon in exchange for a hezbollah
guarantee on security of the Jewish settlements in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
After making a telephone contact on Friday night with French
Foreign Minister Herve De Charette, Lebanese Foreign Minister
Boueiz received a call from his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz expressed a fear on an Israeli attempt to enlarge the
buffer zone in South Lebanon in order to make it wider than the
range of the (Hezbollah's) Katyusha rockets.
</P>
<P>
He accused the U.S. administration of adopting a "negative
position" toward any call for a meeting of the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli occupation forces are continuing its
bombardments in South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the south reported that the Israeli forces
at 7:15 am (4:15 GMT) bombarded the village of Yater and an area
between the towns of Jibshit and Shukin. And earlier bombardments
at southern Lebanese villages led to the wounding of two
civilians.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese army sources reported that Israel carried out 40 air
raids at targets in Lebanon Friday, 30 of which targeted southern
Lebanese areas, and two others aimed at Beirut's south suburbs.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Businessmen Urged to Promote Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 13 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa
has urged the indigenous business community to take advantage of
the country's rich natural endowments and translate them into a
better life for the people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a dinner hosted by the Tanzania Chamber of
Commerce, Industry and Agriculture here on Friday, Mkapa said it
was individuals, groups or institutions that could make Tanzania
a better or worse place to live in.
</P>
<P>
"God the Almighty has been kind to us giving us a beautiful
country, richly endowed with resources, geographically well
positioned and above all, a country at peace with its neighbors
and itself," he observed.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa pointed out that these advantages should be
translated into a better life for the people.
</P>
<P>
He said the appeal was intended to awaken the indigenous
businessmen to their responsibility of building a truly national
economy.
</P>
<P>
"We need foreign investment because we can't do without
foreign capital, technology and markets, but foreign investors
have their own countries, and are not here for charity," he said,
pointing out that whereas foreigners will eventually return to
their countries of origin, tanzanians will remain with whatever
they contributed to make the Tanzania of tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The president added that the pursuit of short-term individual
benefits should not blind the people to their responsibilities
for long-term development and prosperity of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
He noted whereas it was true that profit and large fortunes
constituted strong motivation for entrepreneurship and business,
indigenous Tanzanians should embrace the public good.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa called for a genuine partnership between the business
community and the government so as to develop a truly national
economy.
</P>
<P>
He said he needed full support of the private sector in his
crusade against corruption because great corruption that is
eating away the country's economy revolves around business
people.
</P>
<P>
The business community has urged the government to rationalize
the taxation system and change would be seen in the next budget,
said Mkapa.

<HEADLINE> More Projects To Improve Tourism Facilities On Mount Wuyi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Four major construction projects
will be launched to improve tourism facilities in the tourism zone
around Wuyi Mountain, a famous scenic spot in east China's Fujian
Province.
</P>
<P>
The four projects are a international conference center, a
bowling center, an entertainment complex and a water recreation
center.
</P>
<P>
Set up in 1992, the Wuyi Mountain Tourism Zone was the among
the first 11 national ones. With an area of 12 sq km, the zone is

<HEADLINE> Internet Brings Zhejiang Unexpected Business Opportunities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The world-wide internet has
given a Chinese hotel an amazing leap forward.
</P>
<P>
The Wanghu Hotel in Hangzhou, capital city of east China's
Zhejiang Province, has seen its business volume in the first
quarter of this year reach the equivalent of the whole of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The hotel owners say the four-fold increase is because its
information can reach more than 60 million subscribers on the
world-renowned Internet.
</P>
<P>
The hotel is one of the local companies to benefit from the
"Golden Pigeon" Project, launched by the province to publicize its
economic information on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Soon after Zhejiang Automotive Trade Corporation announced its
commercial information on the network, three foreign companies
sent representatives to the corporation to negotiate possible
cooperation in auto spares and parts.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang, one of the most affluent provinces in east China, now
regularly publicizes information on the developments of local
economic reforms and investment environment, which is accessible
to Internet subscribers in some 150 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
China has 20,000 subscribers linked to the web, which has been
a hot topic since it was first introduced into the country several
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Provincial government officials said that this project is run
by two returned overseas Chinese students, who were the first to
register a Chinese commercial information distribution center on
the network.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Tea Production Drops Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's tea production dropped
by 768 tons in 1995 while exports fell by 289 tons in comparison
with those of 1994, reported the local daily "the New Vision"
today.
</P>
<P>
A 1995 report on the tea industry by Uganda Tea Authority was
quoted as attributing the fall in production to shortage of
labor, drought, lack of fertilizers and inputs and high
production costs.
</P>
<P>
The country's tea production in 1995 was 12,692 tons,
including 3,445 tons of Uganda Tea Growers Corporation, 3260 tons
of Rwenzori Highlands Tea Company, 2,807 tons of Toro and Mityana
Tea Company Ltd, 1,962 tons of Uganda Tea Corporation and the
rest 1,218 tons, while the production in 1994 was 13,460 tons.
</P>
<P>
Tea exports in 1995 were 10,682 tons while the figure for 1994
was 10,971 tons.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fall in last year's crop, the report predicts a
boom in this year's production and exports.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the industry has been hampered by
uncompleted rehabilitation of relatively small private tea
estates which account for 22 percent of tea production in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"This group stillna limps due to lack of support from financial
institutions and source," said the report, it also points out the
high duty and taxes on tea machinery spares, leaf bags and other
inputs.

<HEADLINE> China Now World's 3rd Largest Elevator Manufacturer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The more than 30,000 elevators
that are produced each year in China, mean that it has become the
third largest manufacturer in the world, after the United States
and Japan, "China Machinery and Electronics" has reported.
</P>
<P>
This is a great leap forward from the 10,000 elevators produced
in the 30 years from 1949, when New China was founded, to 1979,
when the reform and opening up policy was initiated.
</P>
<P>
What is even more important is that China is now capable of
large-scale production of more sophisticated elevators, the paper
says.
</P>
<P>
However, it notes that both the quality and quantity of
domestic elevators still cannot meet domestic demand because the
country is also the largest elevator market in the world.
</P>
<P>
To make up for that shortcoming, China has to spend more than
400 million US dollars each year in importing 7,000 to 8,000
elevators, and imports of spare parts are also enormous.
</P>
<P>
To improve the quality of elevator production and maintenance,
the Chinese government has published its "Provisional Regulations
for Better Management of Elevators", imposing stiff requirements
on manufacture, installation, and maintenance.

<HEADLINE> Dismissed Worker Wins Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, April 13 (Xinhua) -- A worker in this coastal city in
northeast China's Liaoning Province has won a lawsuit against his
former employer and been compensated for wrongful dismissal.
</P>
<P>
Qu Shiwei, a contracted worker, was fired by the Dalian Zhongce
Rubber Co. Ltd for failing to show up for work for 58 consecutive
days in February last year.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhongce failed to notify Qu of the decision within
seven days, nor did it transfer Qu's personal file and other data
to the unemployment insurance institution of the area where he has
a residence permit. Both of which are mandatory according to local
labor regulations.
</P>
<P>
Zhongce did not complete the required process until mid-January
this year, a delay of 90 days, preventing Qu from claiming
unemployment benefit for months.
</P>
<P>
On February 6 this year, Qu filed a complaint with the labor
dispute arbitration bureau of his district, demanding compensation
for loss of unemployment benefit for 24 months.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month the arbitration bureau reached a verdict,
holding Zhongce accountable for the economic loss Qu had suffered,
some 4,134 yuan (about 500 US dollars) in all.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that as China shifts to a market economy, Chinese
enterprises must be careful to strictly observe laws and
regulations, or they will be brought to justice accordingly.

<HEADLINE> Chinese More Ready to Change Jobs (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, April 13 (Xinhua) -- When it comes to changing or not
changing a job, it may take a Chinese father years to understand
his daughter.
</P>
<P>
Dian Chunling, a 26-year-old girl who has already changed her
job three times in the five years since her graduation from
college, said that she feels better each time after a change of
job.
</P>
<P>
"I'm quite satisfied with my present work," said Dian, who now
works as a beauty counselor in a cosmetics company in this, her
hometown in the northeastern Chinese province of Liaoning.
</P>
<P>
Dian recalled that her father, Dian Yalin, was firmly opposed
to her decision of leaving the Dalian Steel Wire Plant, her first
employer and a state-owned enterprise, nearly five years ago.
</P>
<P>
The elder Dian, 54, has worked at the Dalian Second Machine
Tool Plant since he was 19. He did not come to understand his
daughter's dissatisfaction with her job until his own plant was
merged by a local competitor last year, realizing jobs can be
insure.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that the time-honored tradition of being faithful
to "one job for life" is being smashed in China. Even the people
of the older generation are becoming less loyal to their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Such a change in people's attitude can be felt even on a city
bus. In the past people used to greet each other with "How about
your work unit?" But today people ask, "Do you still work at the
same unit?".
</P>
<P>
Teng Yupin, 50, was a government employee until China launched
its reform and opening-up drive in the late 1970s. Eager to
embrace the country's drive for a market economy, he then "dived
into the sea of business" as chief representative in Dalian of a
company headquartered in south China's island province of
Hainan. Today he is a deputy manager of the local Caesar's Palace
Night Club.
</P>
<P>
"A change of work environment enables me to learn something
new," Teng said.
</P>
<P>
In the old days of the centrally-planned economy, a Chinese
employee was dependent on his unit -- the enterprise for which he
worked -- for almost everything, ranging from old-age pension to
medical insurance.
</P>
<P>
As China shifts to a market economy and reforms its social
security system, gone are the days when work units provided a
comprehensive social security umbrella for their employees.

<P>
Therefore, no matter how long Dian Yalin has worked for his
firm, he has to rely on a yet-to-mature social security regime for
his days after retirement, just like his daughter.
</P>
<P>
"Old-age pension has become something regardless of where and
how long you work, and this makes it unnecessary for job-hoppers
to worry about their wellbeing," Dian said.
</P>
<P>
In many parts of China, the social security institutions now
provide workers with old-age pensions and unemployment, medical,
injury and maternity insurance.
</P>
<P>
A government official reminded, however, that the end of the
"one job for life" concept relies much on the establishment and
perfection of a social security and employment system and new
capital and labor relations.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that the relationship between employee and
employer is now bonded by labor contracts, which were unknown to
Chinese until just two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Labor has revealed that 80 percent of Chinese
workers have signed labor contracts with their companies, and the
old system whereby employment was arranged by the government has
been replaced by a market-oriented employment system, under which
the employee and employer bargain individually.
</P>
<P>
Official data show that more and more Chinese have become ready
to change their jobs so long as such a change is beneficial to the
fulfilment of their personal wishes and ambitions.
</P>
<P>
"I'll not hesitate to change my job again if a more ideal one
crops up," Dian Chunlin said, quoting an ancient Chinese proverb
of "A tree may wither away provided it is moved, whereas a change
of job can make a human more vigorous and hopeful."

PYONGYANG, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) insists on signing a peace treaty to
replace the armistice agreement signed at the end of Korean War in
1953, a DPRK foreign ministry spokesman said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The statement was regarded as a response to the reactions taken by
the United States and South Korea on the entrance of DPRK soldiers
into the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) separating DPRK and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman accused the violations of the Armistice Agreement
by the United States and South Korea, especially the latest series
of large-scale military exercises, saying that it is the United
States and South Korea who should be responsible for the tension
in the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said in a written statement that his country will
continue to honor the armistice agreement till a new peace treaty,
which was proposed by the DPRK, is signed to replace the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. should adopt a prudent policy toward the
situation in the peninsula, adding that DPRK will persist in its
position on replacing the armistice agreement with a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
DPRK announced on April 4 it would no longer maintain the
status of both the military demarcation line and the DMZ
stretching across the divided Korean peninsula.

<HEADLINE> FM: Israel Not to Confront Syrian Army in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Ehud Barak
said last night that Israel has no interest in striking the
Syrian army in Lebanon, but will continue to hit Hezbollah bases
wherever they are.
</P>
<P>
Barak made the statement on Israel Television. He said anyone
who objects to the hits should put an end to Hezbollah activities
against Israel. The foreign minister was apparently referring to
Syria's reluctance to rein in Hezbollah in accordance with the
understanding brokered by the U.S. in 1993 in the wake of Israel's
Operation Accountability.
</P>
<P>
In response to a Lebanese government call for negotiations,
Barak indicated that there is no point to hold a dialogue with the
Lebanese government until it takes steps to prevent the launching
of Katyusha attacks against Israel.
</P>

According to a Beirut report, the Lebanese Prime Minister
Rafik Al-Hariri called on Israel to discuss a resolution to the
situation. He spoke at a press conference that a political
solution should be found as the problem cannot be solved by
military means. He accused Israel of what he called a crazy war
which cannot lead to anywhere because it cannot destroy Hezbollah
or make Israeli border safer, but can only escalate the situation.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that Israel continued attacking Hezbollah
 positions in south Lebanon through the night, only to stop over
midnight due to stormy weather.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day yesterday, Israel launched a total of 16
attacks in south Lebanon and two missions in the Beirut area.
More artillery units were despatched to the north.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Tin, CPO, Rubber Markets in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The tin price on the Kuala
Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) ended the week slightly higher today but
trading was thin.
</P>
<P>
The tin price closed the week at 15.96 Malaysian ringgit (about
6.38 US dollars) per kilogram, one sen higher than that of last
week. The market was traded in a tight range throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
The highest price quoted this week was 15.98 ringgit (about
6.39 US dollars) per kilogram Tuesday and Wednesday but slid to
15.93 ringgit (about 6.37 US dollars) per kilogram Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The total turnover for the week fell to 477 tons from 494 tons
in the previous week, and the KLTM price differential to the
London Metal Exchange (LME) narrowed to a premium of 70 US dollars
per ton Friday against a premium of 95 US dollars previously.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian rubber market ended the week lower. The price
for May RSS1 fell nine sen to end the week at 365 sen (about 1.46
US dollars) per kilogram from last week's close of 374 sen (about
1.49 US dollars), while the SMR20 dropped 12 sen to 333.5 sen
(about 1.33 US dollars) per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said there were some hopes that the prices would
rebound in the near term, and they expected some buying interests
from China and some other fresh demands from the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of rubber supply due to the rainy season did not
help much to push prices upward as buyers were on the sidelines
waiting for the price to fall further, while suppliers held on to
their position waiting for higher prices.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile on the crude palm oil (CPO) market, the CPO physicals
ended the week weaker. The price for April South ended 10 ringgit
lower to 1,285 ringgit (about US 514 dollars) per ton.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China's sole island province of
Hainan, in south China, will promote ten tourism programs this

</P>
<P>
The ten programs include holidays on tropical beaches, folk
customs of ethnic minorities, leisure time spent by hot springs,
viewing tropical plants, tasting local foods, touring cultural
sights and relics, business meetings and investigation tours.
</P>
<P>
Hainan has improved both its travel facilities and services.
</P>
<P>
With eight international air routes soon to be opened by
Phoenix Airport in Sanya City, the second-biggest airport after
the Haikou Airport, all round-island tours will have Haikou and
Sanya as their starting and ending points.
</P>
<P>
The province has conducted a thorough check of its travel
services, hotels, tourist shops, and tourist spots, in accordance
with a set of tourism regulations issued last year. Those

<HEADLINE> Expedition to Clear Garbage from Mount Qomolangma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China will send an expedition to
remove garbage from around the mountaineering base camp on Mount
Qomolangma, also known as the Everest overseas, the world's
highest mountain, on the Sino-Nepalese border, on June 5, the
World Environment Day.
</P>
<P>
The expedition, organized by a Yunnan travel service, a
Beijing-based company and the China Association for Mountaineering
and Exploration, will erect a monument on the mountain to mark
their efforts and call for public awareness of the importance of
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
As more and more climbers tackle the challenge of the world's
highest mountain, an increasing amount of non-biodegradable waste
materials is piling up on both the southern and northern
slopes. And environmental protection on the mountain has become an
issue of international concern.
</P>
<P>
Some of China's top veteran mountaineers who have climbed Mount
Qomolangma, including Wang Fuzhou, Goinbo and Pandog, scientists
and reporters will join scientists on the expedition.
</P>
<P>
The 50-odd members of the expedition, in two teams, will leave
this provincial capital of Yunnan May 18. One team will take the
Yunnan-Tibet Highway to reach Lhasa, capital of the Tibet
Autonomous Region, and the other will fly to Lhasa via Chengdu,
capital of Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The expedition will stay on the mountain for four days, during
which time 5,000 commemorative envelopes, postmarked by the
world's highest post office, at the base camp, will be issued to
mark the expedition.
</P>
<P>
Other activities will include release of a hot-air balloon, an
amateur radio station broadcast on the mountain for the first time
and a thorough check of the local environment.
</P>
<P>
The Yunnan Exploration Travel Agency, the chief organizer of
the expedition, caters for overseas travelers who come to China
for exploration tours. Founded in April 1995, it has received more
than 50 travel groups from Japan, the United States, Britain,
France, Switzerland and Singapore in the past year.

<HEADLINE> Death of Thai State Media Chief Mourned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The death of the assassinated
Thai state media chief Saengchai Sunthornwat was mourned by his
family members, friends and colleagues here today as the rest of
the nation were celebrating the Thai New Year of Songkran.
</P>
<P>
The 53-year-old director-general of the Mass Communication
Organization of Thailand (MCOT) was killed Thursday evening when
he was returning home in his car driven by his wife.
</P>
<P>
A gunman fired a single bullet through the left rear door
window of Saengchai's car before fleeing on a motorcycle. The
bullet pierced through his lung and cut a coronary artery.
</P>
<P>
Senior MCOT and government officials described Saengchai's
death as a great loss.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa, who attended the bathing
rites for Saengchai Friday, said Saengchai "was a very talented
and creative person and his death is regrettable."
</P>
<P>
Banharn said his government had intended to extend Saengchai's
office for another term because he had proven to be an efficient
and capable administrator of the MCOT, a state enterprise that
operates TV channel 9, the Thai News Agency and a few FM and AM
radio stations.
</P>
<P>
Saengchai took up the post in June 1993.
</P>
<P>
Many people, including the police, speculate that a conflict of
interest could have occurred after Saengchai ordered changes in
the programming of TV and radio stations under the MCOT.
</P>
<P>
Saengchai was a well-known columnist on politics and world
affairs in the widely-circulated Thai Rath newspaper. He was also
popular for his column on the usage of English vocabulary and
idioms.

<HEADLINE> Fruit Trees Fatten Farmers' Wallets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The planting of cash crop trees
such as date, apple, Chinese chestnut and walnut has enriched the
wallets of farmers in northwest China's Shaanxi Province as well
as improved the natural environment.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi, which covers eight latitudes, is home to some 400
varieties of trees of economic value.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-year Plan (1991-1995) period, the area
of cash crop forests in the province increased at an annual rate
of 92,000 ha, accounting for some 35 percent of the new forest
areas. At present, there are 1.46 million ha of forests of
economic value in the province, which yield 4.2 billion yuan-worth
of output value a year.
</P>
<P>
The forestry construction is closely related with rural
economic development. In Hancheng City more than 4,000 rural
households each earn over 10,000 yuan, a handsome income for a
country with a per capita GNP of just over 800 US dollars, from
Chinese prickly ash trees every year.
</P>
<P>
To stimulate farmers' enthusiasm for planting trees, local
authorities encourage them to contract the rehabilitation of
barren mountains, sometimes for as long as 70 years. In Yan'an, a
veteran Communist revolutionary base, more than 66,000 barren
mountains have been afforested, half of which are covered by
apple, apricot and date trees.

<HEADLINE> Shougang Iron, Steel Company Earns 700 Million US Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The Capital Iron and Steel
Company, also known as Shougang, posted foreign exchange earnings
of nearly 700 million US dollars during the 1991-1995 period,
according to the latest official release.
</P>
<P>
The amount is equal to seven percent of the company's total
sales volume in the five years.
</P>
<P>
Last year Shougang, one of the largest iron and steel complexes
in China, earned over 230 million US dollars-worth of foreign
exchange, up from 47.7 million US dollars-worth in 1991, said the
release, according to which the company was the Chinese capital's
largest foreign exchange earner over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Between 1991 and 1995, Shougang exported 2.05 million tons of
steel rods, twisted steel, steel plates and steel billets, with
1995's exports standing at 700,000 tons of rolled steel, about 4.6
times the 1991 figure.
</P>
<P>
Shougang's exports have reached more than 40 countries and
regions in Asia, Europe, America and Africa, with top importers
including Hong Kong, Macao, the United States, Canada, the
Republic of Korea and some Southeast Asian nations in the past few
years, the release said.

<HEADLINE> Rural Beijing Benefits from Pollution-Free Energy Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The development of pollution-free
energy resources has brought great benefits to both environmental
protection and economic growth in the suburban areas of the
Chinese capital, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal Office for Rural Energy Resources said
that such programs can save more than 3 million tons of coal
annually and create 690 million yuan in profits. Moreover, these
programs also have reduced the discharge of wastes and pollutants.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that at present some 73,000 of Beijing's rural
households have set up methane-generating pits, with the annual
output of methane equalling more than 12,000 tons of standard coal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, construction of large-scale methane-generating
projects is going on rapidly. Liuminying Village in Daxing County
built a 100-cu-m high-temperature fermenting methane-generating
project in 1993. Now the village's 240 households and local
restaurants are using piped methane for cooking.
</P>
<P>
Comprehensive utilization of methane in rural Beijing has
proved successful.
</P>
<P>
A survey among 760 rural households showed that each year they
can raise 64,000 pigs and 118,000 chickens with methane sediment,
and feed fish in 470 ha of fish ponds with liquid gas waste,
saving some 9,000 tons of fodder. The rest of the sediment can be
used in planting more than 60000 ha of vegetables and crops.
</P>
<P>
More local industrial enterprises have also devoted great
efforts to using methane-generating technology to treat industrial
waste.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the city has explored ways to make use of solar energy
in cultivating vegetables in winter. In suburban Beijing 870 ha of
greenhouses have been built, saving some 500,000 tons of coal and
saving 30 million kg of waste gas.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, rural Beijing has also set up solar energy geysers

<HEADLINE> India Unearths Massive Telephone Racket </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 13 (Xinhua) -- India's Central Bureau of
Investigation (CBI) has detected a massive racket involving the
diversion of long distance telephone facility from genuine
subscribers to illegal telephone lines, the Hindustan Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Unaccounted bills of some 15 million rupees (about 430,000 US
dollars) were passed on to various subscribers of the Mahanagar
Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL) in the southern part of the
capital.
</P>
<P>
The investigation followed a string of complaints from
subscribers to the MTNL in the last few months against excessive
billing and being charged for long distance calls they never made.
</P>
<P>
After days of undercover operations and sustained surveillance,
the CBI succeeded in detecting the telephone numbers and places
from where the calls were actually being made.
</P>
<P>
The bills were being diverted by at least four conniving MTNL
employees to subscribers who never made the calls.
</P>
<P>
The investigative agency raided the premises of a restaurant
and a communications center in south Delhi, where a large number
of incriminating documents were recovered and unauthorized
telephone lines were found installed.
</P>
<P>
The restaurant owner, allegedly the kingpin of the racket, has
absconded.
</P>
<P>
A CBI spokesman indicated that this could only be the tip of
the iceberg and that there were reports of similar rackets
thriving in other exchanges as well.
</P>
<P>
The probe into this malpractice would continue, he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vetoes Foreign Relations Authorization Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Friday vetoed controversial legislation that would have
reorganized the country's foreign affairs agencies and contains a
number of anti-Chinese provisions.
</P>
<P>
"This legislation contains many unacceptable provisions that
would undercut U.S. leadership abroad and damage our ability to
assure the future security and prosperity of the American people,"
Clinton said in a message to Congress.
</P>
<P>
"It would unacceptably restrict the president's ability to
address the complex international challenges and opportunities of
the post-Cold War era," he said.
</P>
<P>
Among the anti-Chinese provisions is an amendment to the Taiwan
Relations Act, which states that the Act supersedes the provisions
of the 1982 Joint Communique between China and the United States.
Clinton pointed out that the 1982 Communique has been "one of the
cornerstones of our bipartisan policy toward China for over 13
years."
</P>
<P>
"The ongoing management of our relations with China is one of
the central challenges of United States foreign policy, but this
bill would complicate, not facilitate, that task," he said.
</P>
<P>
The bill was designed to upgrade U.S. relations with Taiwan and
increase pressure on China in areas like human rights and Tibet,
which would have constituted gross violations of China's
sovereignty and interference in China's domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
The provisions have been strongly opposed by the Chinese
government.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also objected to the limits set in the bill on U.S.
participation in international organizations.
</P>
<P>
The provisions are "at odds with ongoing discussions between
the Administration and the Congress aimed at achieving consensus
on these issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In its current form," he said, "the bill is inconsistent with
the decades-long tradition of bipartisanship in U.S. foreign
policy," and "would seriously impair the conduct of U.S. foreign
affairs."
</P>
<P>
This was the 14th time that Clinton had used his veto power
since becoming president in early 1993. Congress is not likely to
muster enough votes to override the veto.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis:  South Korean Parties to Race to Forge Alliances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 12 (Xinhua) -- With no party securing a majority
in the South Korean general elections, competition is heating up
to woo new independent legislators.
</P>
<P>
The governing New Korea Party led by President Kim Young-sam
lost its majority in the National Assembly and is now faced with
the struggle of courting the 16 independent legislators to form a
majority in the new parliament to stabilize the rest of Kim's
five-year presidency.
</P>
<P>
The NKP won 139 seats in the general election, 11 less than it
had in the outgoing parliament and 11 short of an absolute
majority in the 299-seat National Assembly. The number was well
down on the 175 seats predicted by the nation's three major
television networks after polls closed on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
All 16 independents who stood were elected into office,
indicating that the major political parties are not fully trusted
by the public.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party in the 1988 and 1992 parliamentary elections
also failed to gain a majority, but succeeded in taking in the
independents and even opposition members.
</P>
<P>
However, this time it won't be easy for the NKP to woo the
independents. Apart from those in open conflict with the
ruling party, some independents like Won Yoo-chol, Park Jong-woo,
Hwang Sung-Kyun and Lim Jin-chul were forced to leave the NKP to
run in the election after their candidacies were denied.
</P>
<P>
One alternative for the NKP is to strike an alliance with the
minor Democratic Party (DP). The DP won only 15 seats, five seats
short to form a negotiation group in the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the leading opposition party, the National Congress
for New Politics (NCNP) fell short of winning the one-third of
seats its leader Kim Dae-jung vowed he would use to force an
investigation into the funding of President Kim's 1992 campaign.
</P>
<P>
The NCNP won 79 seats, up from 55 at the last election but
fewer than the expected 100 seats which could cost 71-year-old Kim
Dae-jung the nomination for a fourth run for the presidency next
year.
</P>
<P>
Kim Dae-jung, Kim Young-sam's chief rival, accused the
president of using millions of dollars from a slush fund gathered
by his predecessor Roh Tae Woo, who is now on trial on bribery
charges.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said although the NKP lost its majority, Kim
Young-sam's internal and external policies are unlikely to change.
</P>
<P>
Four major political parties and 16 independents ran in the
parliamentary elections yesterday. The big winner seems to be the
conservative opposition, the United Liberal Democrats, led by
aspiring presidential candidate Kim Jong-pil. The party won 50
seats than the estimated 33.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Armed Forces Urged to Be Put Under  Caretaker Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi Defense Ministry
must be placed under the chief adviser of the caretaker government
to keep the armed forces above controversy, the country's former
largest opposition party -- the Awami (People's) League (AL) --
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution issued after its presidium meeting Friday, the
AL said the president of the country had virtually expressed
no-confidence in the caretaker government by keeping the Defense
Ministry under himself.
</P>
<P>
It "is also contrary to the spirit of parliamentary democracy
and the constitution," said the resolution.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry was placed under Prime Minister Begum
Khaleda Zia during the last regime of the Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP) although President Abdur Rahman Biswas has kept the
post of the commander in chief of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
After the caretaker government was set up last Wednesday
following the dissolution of the parliament and the resignation of
the prime minister, the Defense Ministry has been under the
president who is a member of the former ruling party.
</P>
<P>
The national armed forces would be controversial and lose its
image if they remain under the president, the AL resolution said,
adding that this has cast doubts among the people over the holding
of free and fair parliamentary polls.

<HEADLINE> Extent of Damage at Chernobyl Remains Unclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Top experts from around the world
still have no conclusive figures concerning the damage caused by
the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl 10 years ago after a four-day
meeting here.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 politicians, experts and other delegates wound up
the meeting today on the aftereffects of the worst civilian
nuclear accident in history with appeals and recommendations for
tightening nuclear safety controls.
</P>
<P>
Although there was lack of decisive action, they did agree that
initial estimates may be too high on Chernobyl's impact on humans
and the environment.
</P>
<P>
Reading a closing statement, German Environment Minister Angela
Merkel, who presided over the meeting, said there is evidence
linking 31 deaths directly to the accident.
</P>
<P>
The toll was among firemen and personnel taking part in the
clean-up efforts immediately after a reactor at the Chernobyl
plant caught fire and exploded on April 26, 1986.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 237 people in the same group suffered various
radiation-related illnesses as high doses of radiation were
released from the reactor in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
These casualty figures are much lower than those circulating in
the news media over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
However, participants of the meeting debated heatedly, but
failed to agree, on how many of others joining in the later stages
of clean-up operations have become victims.
</P>
<P>
In the closing statement, they called for decommissioning other
reactors that are still operational at the Chernobyl plant, and
constructing a second shield on the damaged No. 4 reactor.
</P>
<P>
The first shield on the reactor, built with cement right after
the accident to prevent further release of radioactive materials
into the air, may pose a long-term safety risk, they said.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, about 200 tons of nuclear fuels are still
in the reactor and part of them still active.
</P>
<P>
As to nuclear reactors similar to those at Chernobyl, or the
so-called PBMK reactors, the closing statement urged operators to
improve safety measures, so as to meet safety standards.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen PBMK reactors, mostly built by the former Soviet Union,
are still operational in Russia, Ukraine and Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
Merkel admitted that lack of financing has been a major factor
that makes countries involved reluctant to discuss the option of
shutting down all these reactors.
</P>
<P>
The just-concluded meeting was co-sponsored by the
International Atomic Energy Agency, the World Health Organization
and the European Commission to mark the 10th anniversary of the
Chernobyl disaster.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister P.V.
Narasimha Rao Friday ruled out any move to scale up the limit of
election expenses in the coming general elections, the Hindustan
Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Rao made the remarks when asked at a press conference here
whether the government was inclined to raise the ceiling of
expenditure for parliamentary and assembly elections through an
ordinance.
</P>
<P>
"This is no time for any such action. If I do raise it, you
will be the first to criticize it," Rao replied.
</P>
<P>
Rao, also president of the ruling Congress Party, said the
expenditure ceiling and other matters relating to the elections
would have to be dealt with comprehensively and left to the new
Lok Sabha (lower house).
</P>
<P>
There has been a demand for raising the election expenses from
450,000 rupees (12,900 US dollars) to 1.5 million rupees (42,900
US dollars) for Lok Sabha candidates and from 150,000 rupees
(4,300 US dollars) to 600,000 rupees (17,200 US dollars) for
candidates contesting the assembly (state parliament) seats.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Rao also ruled out the possibility of
his retirement from active politics.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question of retirement because there are no
service rules in politics," he said.

BANGKOK, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Traffic in the Thai capital of
Bangkok has been flowing freely in the last two days as the
four-day Songkran (Thai New Year) holiday began Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, there has been slight congestion on main roads leading
out of Bangkok to the provinces.
</P>
<P>
Even though traffic on highways has not been as heavy as
expected, highway police, who work around the clock during the
holiday to provide assistance to motorists, have described traffic
on highways as being "slow."
</P>
<P>
No traffic disaster has been reported in the last two days.
</P>
<P>
Buses, trains and planes were booked solid weeks before the
Water Festival holiday began.
</P>
<P>
More flights have been added to Chiang Mai, Phuket and other
major resort towns to meet the demand.
</P>
<P>
Chiang Mai, known as the Rose of the North, is the best place
in the country to experience the excitement and fun of water
splashing of the Songkran Festival.
</P>
<P>
Artists from Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia and the Dai
ethnic group in China's Yunnan province will give a cultural show
today in Chiang Mai.
</P>
<P>
In towns and other communities, there are processions of
beautiful girls, dancers, carnival floats, bands and beauty
contest. From amidst the beauty contestants, a "queen" of the
festival is chosen.
</P>
<P>
With April being one of the hottest month in Thailand, when
temperatures run as high as over 40 degrees centigrade, people,
especially youngsters, splash water on each other with whatever
utensils, including hoses connected to taps and big jars
containing water placed on pick-up trucks.
</P>
<P>
Everyone in the country is caught in a merry-making mood and
even foreign tourists get a drenching to help quench the heat.
</P>
<P>
On the morning of Songkran Day, young people gently sprinkle
scented water into the hands of the elders and parents as a mark
of respect for them.
</P>
<P>
There are also religious rites held at temples throughout the
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Villagers from northeastern
Thailand today broke off their talks with the Thai government over
land rows while demonstrators said they would stay in the capital
until the dispute is settled, the local press reported.
</P>
<P>
The Forum of Poor, which represents thousands of villagers in
northeastern Thai provinces, said it would not resume the talks
with the government unless local officials stop filling land in a
disputed area in Suphan Buri province.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with the Prime Minister's Deputy Secretary-General
Jongchai Thiengtham, the villagers said they would stay in Bangkok
unless the government finds a new plot of land for them to
resettle.
</P>
<P>
Jongchai offered 16 million baht (640,000 US dollars) in
compensation for the villagers to move out but the villagers said
the sum was too small.
</P>
<P>
The villagers have been demonstrating in front of the
Government House for more than a week, demanding a swift solution
to their problems.
</P>
<P>
The trouble was triggered by local officials' plan to build a
new government center in Pho Kiew district, Suphan Buri province,
on the disputed land, which the villagers claimed belonged to them
before it was declared public land in 1984.

<P>
NEW DELHI, April 13 (Xinhua) -- India's Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP) Friday ruled out the possibility of his party's sharing
power with the current ruling Congress Party in the event of no
party getting majority to form a government after the coming
general elections, the Patriot reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a campaign trip outside Delhi, BJP President
L.K. Advani said "if any such situation arises, we will certainly
try to get the support of like-minded parties other than the
Congress Party to form a government at the center."
</P>
<P>
The BJP was getting offers from several political parties in
this regard, he added without elaboration.
</P>
<P>
The BJP was fighting the 50 years of Congress Party misrule
which was responsible for the ills of the country, Advani said,
noting that sharing power with such a party was out of question.
</P>
<P>
However, Advani reiterated that he was optimistic about getting
clear majority to form a government.

<HEADLINE> Poll Indicates Majority Have Hopeful Outlook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- The public continues to have
positive expectations about sustained stability in social
development this year, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
More than 83 percent of those sampled in last November's survey
expected social development this year to be more or less as stable
as it was in 1995, suggested a survey conducted by researchers
with the State Commission for Economic Restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, random samples have been taken every six months, in
40 cities throughtout 29 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities, said Sun Li, director of the Commission's Social
Survey System.
</P>
<P>
For each survey, Sun added, 2,000 families are selected, and
the selection is changed for each survey to diminish subjective
error.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, the majority of respondents
anticipated that such major aspects of social life as economic
stability, the responsibility of the media and quality of consumer
goods would continue to improve this year.
</P>
<P>
More than one third of the respondents believed that their
family living standards would improve to a degree in 1996,
compared to a meagre 4.3 percent who expected a decline.
</P>
<P>
A bright future for reform was expected by about 70 percent of
those surveyed.
</P>
<P>
However, people were less pleased with economic development
last year than they were with development in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, 27 percent were satisfied with last year's
economic stability, a 7 percent rise over the year before.
</P>
<P>
The principal areas of dissatisfaction concern economic
stability, the quality of consumer goods, the rising prices and
the increasing gap among the people.
</P>
<P>
To alleviate these discontents, most people felt that direct
complaints or reports to the media were effective.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Warns Against Russian Interference With NATO  Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Prime Minister Horn
Gyula said today that Russia has no right to intervene
over the issue of other states joining the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with his Polish
counterpart, Wlodzimierz Cimoszeicz, Horn said Hungary's decision
to join NATO is a matter of sovereignty and no other country has
the right to interfere.
</P>
<P>
Cimoszeicz told the press conference that Russia, which
has repeatedly expressed objection to NATO's eastward expansion, has
failed to show any change in its stand on the issue although
Poland, with its president's visit to Russia earlier this month, has
recently increased dialogue with Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Polish prime minister also stressed that no intervention
from a third country could prevent Poland and Hungary from joining
NATO.
</P>
<P>
On Hungarian-Polish ties, Horn said the two nations, which
wholeheartedly support European-Atlantic integration, will closely
cooperate in the process of entering the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Hungary enjoys close political and economic relations with
Poland. The trade volume between the two countries reached 550
million U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
The Polish prime minister, who arrived here today for a two-day
visit, has met Hungarian President Goncz Arpad and National
Assembly President Gal Zoltan.

alliance at the same time, Romanian President Ion Iliescu said
today.

<HEADLINE> Millions of Chinese Tourists Flocking into Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of Chinese
tourists are flocking to the Sino-Vietnamese frontier areas,
thanks to the improvement of bilateral relations and the reopening
of the Beijing-Hanoi railway, According to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that last year about 1.8 million Chinese
crossed the border for one-day tours of Mong Cai or Lang Son, and
many ventured further down to visit Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City
(Saigon).
</P>
<P>
"Improved diplomatic relations between the two countries have
literally transformed the frontier areas from old battlefields to
a hot tourist destination," the English-language newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Easier travel, including the reopening of the railway between
Beijing and Hanoi in February for the first time since 1979, is
luring cross-border trekkers.
</P>
<P>
More and more domestic tourists are interested in touring the
frontier areas, especially those from Shanghai, Guangdong and
other coastal provinces, the newspaper quoted China Travel Service
guide Wang Hongji as saying.
</P>
<P>
In another development, an expressway from Guilin to Beihai,
via Nanning, is under construction in south China's Guangxi, an
autonomous region bordering Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
When the expressway is completed next year, it is expected that
200,000 French tourists and 180,000 US tourists in Vietnam will
also travel to Beihai and Guilin every year.
</P>
<P>
It also also reported that more than 10,000 Vietnamese tourists
visited China's Nanning, Guangzhou and Shanghai cities last year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier on Human Rights Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Li Peng
said here today that China opposes the practice of interfering in
other countries' internal affairs by making use of the human
rights issue.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with French reporters here, Li said China and
other developing countries differ with Western countries over the
concept of human rights.
</P>
<P>
This, he said, is due to differences in culture and historical
traditions and different stages of economic development, and is
therefore not surprising.
</P>
<P>
He said China is willing to exchange views with Western
countries on human rights issues on the basis of equality and
mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed, China and other developing countries can
not tolerate interference in the internal affairs of other
countries under the pretext of human rights.
</P>
<P>
During the interview, the Chinese premier also answered a
question on the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated China's basic policy, saying that Beijing adheres
to the principle of "peaceful co-existence and one country, two
systems" but makes no commitment to give up the use of force to
solve the Taiwan issue.

<HEADLINE> Management of Paging Industry to Be Strengthened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Pocket pagers are becoming a new
source of noise pollution in China's urban areas, and people's
complaints, though not as loud as the beepers, show that these
pagers have become a part of city life, "China Daily" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Since the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) gave
up the beeper monopoly several years ago, 2,136 private radio
paging stations have now been set up by non-telecom Chinese
enterprises, with a total of 11 million subscribers, compared with
7.3 million at the end of 1994.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the paper said, paging stations established by
telecommunications departments now have 17.4 million subscribers,
compared with 10.3 million in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth in the sector has not come without cost. there
are too many paging stations, and fierce competition has led to
inefficient use of radio frequencies and increases in operating
cost, MPT officials were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Some local authorities have suspended approval for new paging
stations.
</P>
<P>
According to a report in MPT-funded People's Posts and
Telecommunications News, south China's Guangdong Province now has
400 private radio paging stations and 5 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
Most of these stations are small, with each having less than
10,000 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve service and efficiency, the MPT is
encouraging the merger of paging stations.
</P>
<P>
Roaming service, which allows customers to move from city to
city without interruption of paging service, started this month on
a trial basis, and is available in 271 cities.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier: WTO Incomplete Without China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said here
today that the World Trade Organization (WTO) is not true to its
name as China is still excluded from the organization.
</P>
<P>
WTO can not be referred to as a world trade body in real sense,
the premier said, as such a big trading power as China still has
not been accepted as one of its members.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks here this afternoon when he gave an
interview to French reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier said it is unfair that China, which has a
population of 1.2 billion, has yet to be accepted by WTO.
</P>
<P>
Li explained that China is still a developing nation in terms
of per capita gross national product despite the remarkable
development of its economy.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, the demand that China enter WTO in the
capacity of a developed nation is unfair and thus not acceptable.
</P>
<P>
China has lowered its general level of import tariffs from 35.9
percent to 23 percent, Li said, noting that the 36-percent
deduction rate is rare in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that as its economy further develops, China will
continue to cut down its import tariffs.

<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 13 (Xinhua) -- China's northwestern Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region is expected to sponsor an export commodity
fair and hold trade talks in New Siberia in June.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianguo, director of the Autonomous Regional Bureau of
Foreign Economic Cooperation and Trade, said that Xinjiang, which
has close economic ties with Central Asian countries, is focusing
on trade cooperation with the Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the region's fifth Urumqi Economic and
Foreign Trade Talks, to be held in September, will open a special
exhibition hall for Russian products.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that Sino-Russian business people concluded
trade volume totalling more than four million US dollars at its
fourth trade talks last September.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, Xinjiang had invited officials from
the Ministry of Foreign Economic Cooperation and Trade, and
commercial counsellors from Russia and related countries, to
Xinjiang to study and explore to develop economic cooperation and
trade.
</P>
<P>
"Through the trade intercourse with Central Asian countries
over the years, we have come to see that, to further develop trade
among the Common Wealth of the Independent States, it is essential
to strengthen our cooperation with Russia," said Habay, deputy
director of the regional bureau of foreign cooperation and trade.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang concluded trade volume with Russia totalled 38.69
million US dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
"Although the trade contact between Xinjiang and Russia started
later, it is promising because Xinjiang has a railway link," Wei
noted.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the autonomous regional government, foreign trade
enterprises are positively seeking cooperation with leading
industrial enterprises and factories in Russia.

<HEADLINE> Barkley, Richmond on Dream Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Charles Barkley of the Phoenix
Suns and Mitch Richmond of the Sacramento Kings are the choices to
fill the final two spots on the United States Olympic Basketball
squad, local reports said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that that USA Basketball will name Barkley and
Richmond to join 10 other NBA stars in Atlanta this summer on
"Dream Team III."
</P>
<P>
The Dallas Morning Post story contradicts a report on Khtk
Radio in Sacramento Thursday that Richmond and Shawn Kemp of the
Seattle Supersonics were the two choices.
</P>
<P>
Barkley, who is averaging 23.6 points and 11.6 rebounds for
Phoenix, won the league's Most Valuable Player of the Year Award
in 1992-93. Barkley is one of just nine players in NBA history
with 20,000 points and 10,000 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
Richmond, who is averaging 23.3 points per game for Sacramento,
was the Most Valuable Player of the 1995 NBA All-Star Game and his
selection was supported by some of the league's most visible
performers, most notably Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Richmond is on pace to become just the seventh player in NBA
history to average 21 or more points per contest in each of his
first eight seasons.
</P>
<P>
Barkley was a member of Dream Team I that won the gold medal at
the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. Richmond was a member of the 1988
Olympic team that won a bronze medal, the last U.S. Olympic team
comprised entirely of amateur players.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The head of Italy's soccer players'
union said on Friday that a planned serie A strike on April 20 had
been "temporarily suspended".
</P>
<P>
Sergio Campana told reporters after leaving the Italian soccer
federation's headquarters that the AIC union had decided tolift
the immediate threat of a strike because agreement had been
reached on a number of important issues.
</P>
<P>
The suspension was also agreed because the league was meeeting
government officials on April 18. Campana said the union would
meet again in the final week of April to discuss the strike which
could still be held in May.
</P>
<P>
The Italian soccer season ends on May 12.
</P>
<P>
Campana said the union had reached agreement on a key
guarantee fund to help players whose clubs folded.
</P>
<P>
Italian serie A players staged an unprecedented strike on
March 16 and 17 over a range of grievances.
</P>
<P>
They made up the lost matches last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The issues include maintaining limits on players from outside
the European Union in the wake of the European Court's recent
Bosman ruling and they are seeking the immediate abolition of
transfer fees at the end of the current season.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Follow Bonds Higher as Inflation Fears Retreat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street gained
strength Friday with bond prices, as fresh economic data and lower
commodities prices eased fears of a resurgence of inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 45.52 points to 5,532.59,
recouping a fraction of the sell-off that occurred from Monday
through Wednesday. For the week, the Dow lost 150.29 points.
</P>
<P>
The closely watched indicator also is 157.15 points, or 2.8
percent, below the all-time closing high of 5,689.74, which was
set April 3.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts regarded the rebound as technical. But technical
or not, the advance was broad.
</P>
<P>
Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 2 to 1. Volume was strong
at 411.95 million shares, but well below Thursday's 519.66 million
figure, the sixth-busiest day ever.
</P>
<P>
Broad market indexes followed the blue-chips higher. The NYSE's
composite index rose 3.03 to 342.41. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index rose 5.53 to 636.71. The Nasdaq composite index
rose 2.75 to 1,099.89, while the American Stock Exchange's market
value index rose 2.07 to 572.26.
</P>
<P>
Stocks got a big boost from the bond market, where the 30-year
Treasury bond yielding was 6.81 percent, down from 6.93 percent
late Thursday and an eight-month high of 6.94 percent Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Blue-chip stocks rose broadly. The Dow industrials were led
higher by stocks representing a diverse group of industries.
</P>
<P>
Interest-sensitive stocks, such as banking and finance
companies and utility shares, moved aggressively higher as
interest rates dropped in the bond market.
</P>
<P>
But computer-related stocks retreated, led by IBM.
</P>
<P>
Oil stocks fell as oil prices stumbled on heavy profit-taking.
May crude futures fell 1.94 U.S. dollars to 23.40 U.S. dollars a
barrel in New York. The price hit a five-year high of 25.34 U.S.
dollar a barrel on Thursday.

NEW YORK, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar rose Friday
against the German mark and Japanese yen on enhanced confidence in
the U.S. economy, ending a week of powerful gains for the
greenback.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 108.55 yen, up

<P>
Against the mark, the dollar rose to 1.5035 marks from 1.5020
marks on Thursday. It gained 1.3 percent from last Friday's level.
</P>
<P>
Some traders expect the German central bank will reduce
interest rates. A cut in German rates would help the dollar
against the mark because relatively higher rates in the United
States would attract more funds.
</P>
<P>
The dollar's gains against the yen were more technically
driven, according to analysts.

</P>
<P>
Mugabe highly praised the friendly relations between the two
peoples. He said, "Zimbabwe constantly regards China as a most
reliable friend."

On trade between the two countries, he hoped that China would
import more Zimbabwe's agricultural products and Zimbabwe would
import some necessities from China on the basis of mutual
benefit.

He stressed the point that there exist immense potential and
broad prospects in trade and economic cooperation between the two
countries.

The state councillor also praised the Zimbabwean government to
implement the practical and flexible policy, making many
achievements in economic development in the country.

cooperation. "The Zimbabwe's experience in production,
purchasing, processing and selling of tobacco and cotton merits
our learning," the Chinese state councillor said.

After the meeting, Chen Junsheng called on Speaker of
Zimbabwean Parliament Cyril Ndebele.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Rawlings Flies To Liberia On Peace Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings
flew to the Liberian Capital Monrovia today to appeal to rival
groups in that country to end their fighting, said a report
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, the West African peacekeeping force in
Liberia known as ECOMOG, and international diplomats have also
called on the rival factions to stop their armed clashes around
Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings, who is currently the Chairman of the West African
Economic Community (ECOWAS), partly directs the ECOMOG peace-
keeping force. ECOWAS sent the peacekeepers to Liberia in August
1990, eight months after the Liberian civil war broke out.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG troops have not yet moved into the Mamba Point embassy
quarter of Monrovia, where up to 20,000 refugees are camped out
without access to food and water.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said that some people had already died because of
the bad conditions and doctors without borders said stopping
disease from spreading there was becoming impossible.
</P>
<P>
As thousands of heavily armed militia members have roamed the
capital for days, murdering people and plundering shops, tens of
thousands of local residents have been unable to gain access to
food and water.
</P>
<P>
Aid organizations have warned that the Liberian capital faced
mass starvation if the hostilities continued.
</P>
<P>
In the six years of the Liberian civil war, the capital has
been relatively safe until fighting erupted nearly a week ago
after the Liberian interim government tried to arrest Krahn tribe
militia warlord Roosevelt Johnson on murder charges.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Cars Take Top Place in Car Satisfaction  Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Japanese carmakers and their
dealers continue to deliver levels of customer satisfaction that
their British and other rivals "singularly fail to match",
according to the third annual survey of car satisfaction in the
UK.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which is regarded as the motorist's bible in
America, was carried out by J.D. Power and Associates, the U.S.
marketing information company and was based on responses from more
than 14,000 owners of L-registration (1993-94) cars in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Japanese vehicles took all top 10 places in the survey's
ranking of more than 70 cars on factors such as quality of
construction and reliability.
</P>
<P>
Only two European companies, Volkswagen's Skoda subsidiary and
BMW, made it into the top 10 list of companies with which
consumers felt most overall satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
The Toyota Corolla was the individual car scoring highest on
the satisfaction index, followed by the Honda Civic, Toyota Corona
and a variety of models from other Japanese carmakers including
Subaru and Daihatsu.
</P>
<P>
Britain's best-selling car, the Ford Escort, is third from the
bottom. Of the ten worst cars in the league table, six are
Vauxhalls and two Fords.
