Tourists dive down to see Titanic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS to UPDATE with quote from diver &QL; 
 &UR; By HELEN O'NEILL &QC; 
 &UR; AP National Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OFF THE COAST OF NEWFOUNDLAND (AP) _ Four tourists have been
ushered to the Atlantic floor to see the rusting hulk of the
Titanic _ suddenly a sightseeing attraction, 86 years after its
ill-fated voyage.
	   ``Awesome,'' whooped 35-year-old Pat Brown after clambering out
of the cockpit of the 23-foot (7-meter) submersible where he had
spent Wednesday squashed beside fellow passenger Buck Kamphausen
and pilot Anatoly Sagalevitch.
	   ``And humbling too, period. You see the plates and beds and
bottles scattered all around the wreck and you really begin to
understand the tragedy that happened here.''
	   Two Americans and two Germans boarded submersibles that took
them 2 1/2 miles under the North Atlantic's surface, 368 miles (592
kilometers) off Newfoundland, Canada's easternmost province. The
price: dlrs 32,500 per person.
	   The dives were made in defiance of a federal judge's order
barring anyone from visiting the site, because of another company
that owns salvage and other rights to the wreck of the legendary
ocean liner.
	   ``What right has an American court to stop me from visiting a
piece of history on international seas?'' asked Anne White of
England, one of a dozen tourists who joined 85 crew members and
scientists on the expedition.
	   ``After all,'' she said, ``the British built the ship.''
	   The first to go down were two Californians. Their fellow
tourists cheered them on as they climbed into the submersible along
with a Russian pilot, and then were lowered by crane into the
ocean.
	   An hour later, a German student and a photographer followed in
another mini-submarine. The trip to the wreckage takes about 2 1/2
hours.
	   Each of the egg-like submersibles, Mir 1 and Mir 2, has tiny
portholes with thick windows and floodlights to allow a view of the
Titanic's carcass.
	   The trip was planned about a year ago by Mike McDowell, an
Australian living in Germany who organizes adventurous expeditions
around the world.
	   McDowell and his company, Deep Sea Expeditions Ltd., had planned
to bring 60 tourists on the trip, but that was before an injunction
was sought by RMS Titanic Inc., a U.S. company that holds salvage
and photographic rights to the shipwreck.
	   This summer, that company brought up a number of pieces from the
wreck, including a 26-by-20-foot (7.9 by 6.1-meter) segment of
rusted hull.
	   Judge J. Calvitt Clarke Jr. ruled RMS Titanic had exclusive
rights to excavate, view and photograph the ship because it was
``preserving the artifacts salvaged from the wreck for the benefit
of all mankind.''
	   He barred anyone from going within 10 nautical miles of the
wreck. The ship, billed as unsinkable, hit an iceberg and went down
on its maiden voyage in 1912, with a loss of more than 1,500 lives.
	   McDowell is appealing the ruling. He argues that a U.S. court
has no right to prevent anyone from viewing the wreck in
international waters.
	   His ship ``has every right to be here on international waters
doing scientific research and programs, especially in this area
where no attempt at salvaging is being undertaken,'' he said as he
paced the deck.
	   The ship _ the Akademik Keldysh, owned by the Shirshov Institute
of Oceanology _ has made numerous trips to the site, and even took
James Cameron, director of the film ``Titanic,'' to see the wreck.
	   McDowell says the money from tourists is funding scientific
exploration, though he concedes that he envisions long-term profits
from other such expeditions.
	   Almost all of the tourists pulled out of the trip after the
lawsuit, but a few _ five Americans, five Germans, the Englishwoman
and an Australian _ agreed to go ahead. Some won trips in
competitions, while others paid the full price by themselves.
	   ``They are going to have to catch up with me in Sydney,'' said
Andrew Rogers, a 34-year-old Australian restaurateur who won his
voyage.
	   Nonetheless, the trip was planned at the last minute in a cloak
of secrecy, lest word get out and the law move in. The tourists
boarded the ship in stormy weather Sunday at St. John,
Newfoundland, and spent nearly 48 hours steaming south.
	   The dives take eight to 10 hours, depending on the vagaries of
weather and technology, and are scheduled for the rest of the week.
The ship is to go back to Newfoundland late next week.

	   TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) _ Mexican troops, doctors and rescue
workers were struggling to reach scores of southern towns swamped
by floods, and heavy rains pelted some areas for the seventh
straight day.
	   At least 33 people were confirmed dead and dozens more were
missing in flooding across the country. The Pacific coastal zones
of the southern state of Chiapas have been the most devastated.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo flew to Tapachula, 10 miles (16
kilometers) from the Guatemalan border, on Wednesday night to help
coordinate rescue and relief efforts.
	   ``I think the important thing is for all Mexicans and our
brothers from Chiapas ... to know that we're here and that the
government will be working at full capacity,'' he told the Azteca
television network.
	   Tapachula, a city of 250,000 people, was itself a mess. In the
last three days, it has received 18 inches (45 centimeters) of
rain. Lines were a block long outside grocery stores as residents
waited to buy food.
	   Other towns were also hard hit.
	   ``If the river keeps rising, it's going to reach the center of
town,'' Marco Antonio Santiso told Associated Press Television. He
lives in Huixtla, a town 20 miles (32 kilometers) west of Tapachula
on the Pacific coast.
	   State officials said the death toll could rise. More dead and
injured may be found as rescue workers, many of whom are blocked by
raging rivers and downed bridges, push into the most affected
areas, they said.
	   ``The fact that 25 townships are cut off prevents us from
finding out what has happened to villagers there. They're
completely isolated,'' Roberto Munoz Lievano, Chiapas state
interior secretary, said.
	   In Huixtla, some residents huddled in their homes, ignoring
calls by police to evacuate even as the swollen Huixtla River tore
away and swallowed huge pieces of riverbank and the brick walls of
homes. Torrential downpours lashed the area.
	   Zedillo late Tuesday ordered 1,100 troops and two large jets
loaded with doctors, medical equipment and specialized personnel to
Chiapas.
	   Chiapas Gov. Roberto Albores Guillen declared a disaster zone
along the Pacific coast. He said at least 25,000 people in more
than 50 towns and villages were driven from their homes by rising
rivers and creeks.
	   Zedillo said 26 people had drowned by Wednesday night in Chiapas
and dozens more were missing.
	   Another seven people died in flash flooding in other parts of
Mexico, which is being battered by a tropical storm in the Pacific
and a tropical depression in the Gulf of Mexico.
	   In the Pacific coast state of Sinaloa, the threat of overflowing
dams forced workers to cut away road repairs so that new waters
could escape.
	   Guatemalan authorities evacuated 2,000 people from areas near
the Mexican border after rivers there overflowed their banks.
	   But the worst devastation was in Chiapas.
	   ``People are dying because their houses suddenly were swept
up,'' said Gilberto de los Santos, mayor of the coastal town of
Pijijiapan, where 18 people have drowned.
	   ``There is no way to bury the corpses ... the river keeps rising
and the rain still keeps coming,'' he said.

Japan's central bank eases monetary policy; analysts skeptical
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By JOJI SAKURAI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's leaders guardedly defended Thursday their
decision to loosen up monetary policy by lowering the target for a
key lending rate, admitting it isn't a cure-all but saying it will
give the economy a much-needed boost.
	   Many experts saw even that claim as overly optimistic.
	   In a surprise announcement, the Bank of Japan on Wednesday
lowered the target for the overnight call money rate _ the rate
banks charge each other for overnight lending without collateral.
The new target is a tiny 0.25 percent, down from around 0.5
percent.
	   The decision _ the first easing of policy since 1995 _ does not
affect the official discount rate, which is at a record low of 0.5
percent. The discount rate is the central bank's charge on loans to
banks.
	   Officials said the loosening was aimed at helping companies
borrow money by making it cheaper for banks to obtain funds.
	   Japanese banks, foundering under huge piles of bad debt, have
been reluctant to loan out more money, and that in turn has become
a major drag on efforts to pull Japan out of its worse recession in
decades.
	   But Bank of Japan Gov. Masaru Hayami said that if banks have
ample funds, the so-called ``credit crunch'' may disappear.
	   ``The biggest goal for the easing is to provide even more funds
to the markets and help reduce pressures on corporate fund
raising,'' he said. ``The rate cut gives banks time to improve
their financial condition.''
	   He admitted, however, that larger structural reforms are
necessary to really bring Japan's economy back around.
	   Taichi Sakaiya, head of Japan's Economic Planning Agency, was
even more cautious.
	   While calling the new target a step in the right direction,
Sakaiya said it should have been conducted ``much earlier,'' and
added that he doesn't expect much impact from the easing on the
economy.
	   Analysts tended to agree.
	   ``BOJ easing without structural reform will have very little
effect,'' Cameron Umetsu, senior strategist in charge of money and
foreign exchange at Warburg Dillon Read in Tokyo.
	   Other experts said the rate cut illustrated the limited options
Japan faces in using monetary policy to buoy the economy. Three
years of record-low interest rates have done little to help
Japanese finances.
	   ``It's clearly a belated effort by BOJ to prop up a financial
system that's bereft of liquidity,'' said William Sullivan of
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. Witter said the move was ``meaningless
and an acknowledgement of how bad the banking system is.''
	   Other analysts suggested the real significance is that it may
signal broader action to counter worldwide deflationary pressures.
	   Japanese officials denied the move was linked to similar plans
elsewhere, but speculation to that effect has been intense.
	   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan hinted last week that
the United States might cut interest rates if the global economic
crisis starts hurting the U.S. economy.
	   ``With world markets unstable, the BOJ's easing has a very
significant meaning in that it helps cut off the contagion of
global financial instability,'' said Mamoru Yamazaki of Paribas
Capital Markets.

Cathay Pacific airliner seconds from colliding with Russian jet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A Cathay Pacific jet carrying 260 passengers
and crew members was just seconds from a mid-air collision when an
unidentified Russian airliner flew dangerously close in skies over
Russia, an airline spokeswoman said Thursday.
	   The Cathay Pacific jet was flying on Sunday night over Samara, a
province about 800 kilometers (500 miles) southeast of Moscow, when
the pilot spotted the Russian Tupolev 154 just 1 mile ahead, said
Katherine Wang of the Hong Kong-based air carrier.
	   The Cathay Pacific plane, an Airbus A340 en route from Zurich to
Hong Kong, was not alerted by Russian air controllers about the
other jet. Wang said she doesn't know which company owns the
Russian airliner.
	   Wang said Cathay is not yet sure what had caused the near-miss
but added ``it is clearly the Russian air controllers'
responsibility to monitor the paths'' of the airliners.
	   The South China Morning Post, quoting an unidentified crew
member, reported Thursday the Cathay plane was flying at 800
kilometers (500 miles) per hour when the Russian plane crossed its
path at about the same speed.
	   If the Russian jet had crossed seven seconds later, there would
have been a direct hit, the Post reported.
	   ``When we got on the ground, we drank champagne to celebrate
being alive,'' an unidentified crew member told the Post.
	   Wang said she could not disclose further information until the
pilots submit a full report.
	   The pilots immediately called the Russian air controllers and
pilots on the passing plane, she said. Turbulence rocked the plane,
but the passengers were not told of the incident, she added.
	   ``The most important thing at the time was to alert the traffic
control tower,'' Wang said.
	   Cathay has filed reports to the Hong Kong and Russian aviation
authorities, and it's up to the Russian authorities whether to take
up further investigation, she said.
	   The Post also reported the air controllers had apologized to the
pilots for the near-miss and asked repeatedly for Cathay not to
file an official report.
	   She refused to comment whether Russian controllers had requested
a cover-up, saying the company is awaiting investigative reports.

Foreign media accused of trying to topple Malaysian government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's information minister
accused foreign media of having a political agenda and trying to
topple the government by playing up the recent firing of a
prominent official, a news report said Thursday.
	   Mohamed Rahmat said he suspected the foreign media were
conspiring to force a reformation movement and undermine the
leadership of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the
government-controlled News Straits Times reported.
	   Mahathir has said he fired Anwar Ibrahim from his posts of
deputy and finance minister and expelled him from the ruling
political party for ``moral'' reasons. Anwar is under police
investigation for allegations ranging from sexual misconduct to
leaking state secrets.
	   Mohamed was quoted as saying Anwar had not been charged in court
``but the foreign media is making like Anwar has been punished ...
there is some kind of political agenda out there.''
	   Fearing arrest, Anwar has been holed up in his home since his
dismissal last week. In daily press conferences and nightly
speeches, he has declared his innocence and outlined a political
reform campaign.
	   Mohamed lambasted foreign news services for writing one-sided
reports on Anwar's dismissal and said the ousted politician was
``using the foreign media'' to spread his message.
	   The information minister said the government believed in press
freedom as long as the reports were fair. He said the government
imposed no curbs on its own media except on sensitive issues that
could threaten national security.
	   But senior reporters from two of the country's top newspapers
said they were given strict orders not to print stories that put
Anwar in a positive light.
	   Malaysia's local dailies have all but ignored Anwar's side of
the story, relegating his rallies with 6,000 people to a few
paragraphs on the inside pages without photographs. The
government-controlled News Straits Times ran its first full-fledged
story on Anwar Wednesday, on page four.

Troops guard Indonesia's presidential palace as students protest

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ More than 1,000 troops and police
guarded the state palace Thursday as more than 500 students
protested against President B.J. Habibie in an adjacent park.
	   It was the fourth straight day of bold student protest against
the embattled leader as he struggles to tackle Indonesia's worst
economic crisis in 30 years while reforming its autocratic
political system.
	   About 200 riot police with sticks and shields moved in front of
the palace as the students assembled in the park, the site of
Indonesia's National Monument.
	   A road in front of the palace was blocked off by police as a
line of security personnel moved within a few meters (yards) of the
students.
	   As many as 600 troops armed with rifles were stationed nearby
the white pillared colonial, Dutch-built palace that houses
Habibie's offices.
	   The students, many wearing brightly colored jackets that are the
uniforms of their universities, demanded lower food prices and
called on Habibie's authoritarian predecessor President Suharto to
be put on trial for corruption.
	   They also demanded that the armed forces give up a
constitutionally-sanctioned role in politics under which they are
represented in the Cabinet and the Parliament.
	   Unlike other student demonstrations this week, Thursday's
protesters stopped short of demanding that Habibie quit.
	   ``We are not asking for him to step down because we need someone
to lower prices,'' said one student, who identified himself by the
single name of Husein.
	   ``People are hungry, lower prices,'' read one banner.
	   The demonstration was peaceful, although witnesses said police
stopped another 100 students from entering the park from a nearby
railroad station.
	   Habibie came to power in May after riots and student protests
forced Suharto to resign after 32 years in power. Although Habibie
has said he has done much to attack corruption and nepotism, there
has been growing discontent as prices for food and other essentials
soar and unemployment climbs.
	   On Monday, thousands of students marched on Parliament and tore
down the gates of the legislature.
	   Troops and police used sticks, shields and tear gas to evict
hundreds of students from its grounds on Tuesday.
	   On Wednesday a visit by Habibie to Indonesia's second-largest
city, Surabaya, was marred when 4,000 students and opposition
supporters protested.

Two more boats seized for allegedly poaching prized Patagonian

Toothfish near Antarctica &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ The French navy has seized two boats on
suspicion of poaching Patagonian Toothfish in waters near
Antarctica, an Australian-based fisheries oversight group said
Thursday.
	   The boats were taken into custody about 10 days ago around
Kerguelen, a French territory near Australia's Heard Island, which
is a prime area for the prized fish, said Alistair Graham,
coordinator of the International Southern Oceans Longline Fisheries
Information Clearing House.
	   Both ships, the Antonio Lorenzo and the Ercilla, were owned by
Chilean companies well known for poaching, Graham said.
	   He said the French government was expected to punish the
operators. He called on Chile to take away their fishing licenses
and prosecute the boats' owners and managers for sanctioning
illegal acts.
	   At least three other commercial fishing boats have been caught
in the past year for allegedly poaching the Toothfish in
Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone.
	   Patagonian Toothfish is exported to the United States, Japan and
Europe.
	   It was only discovered in Australian waters two years ago, and
the level of stocks in the Heard and McDonald Islands area are
unknown.
	   Japan imports 12,000 tons of the fish a year. Called ``mero,''
it sells in supermarkets for about 1,700 yen a kilogram (U.S. dlrs
6 a pound). It is usually boiled with soy and sugar or roasted.

Japanese, British glass makers to form a joint venture in Spain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Asahi Glass Co. of Japan and Pilkington Plc. of
Britain, two of the world's biggest glass makers, plan to jointly
build a sheet glass factory in Spain, a Japanese company official
said Thursday.
	   The two companies will construct the dlrs 100 million plant in
Sagunt, an eastern port city near Valencia, with operations slated
to begin 2000, said Asahi Glass spokesman Kenichi Imoto.
	   Under a basic agreement between the two companies, Imoto said a
joint investment company will be set up to own the new plant, which
will have a daily production capacity of 500 tons of sheet glass.
	   Imoto said the two companies have obtained approval for the
joint project from the European Commission.
	   Asahi Glass, Japan's largest comprehensive glass maker, now
controls about 20 percent of the sheet glass market in the world.
Pilkington holds about the same share of the global market, Imoto
said.
	   It will be Asahi Glass's first production of glass in Spain. The
company now exports sheet glass to Spain from its subsidiary in
Belgium, Imoto said.

Ford, three Korean carmakers to bid again for Kia Motors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Ford Motor Co. and three South Korean
carmakers submitted letters of intent Thursday to take part in a
new auction of bankrupt Kia Motors Corp.
	   It is the second time Kia, South Korea's second largest auto
maker, has been put on the block. The first auction earlier this
month failed to find a buyer.
	   New bids must be submitted by Sept. 21. The winner will be
announced a week later.
	   Besides Ford of the United States, the other potential buyers
are Hyundai Motor Co., Daewoo Motor Co. and Samsung Motors Inc.
	   Kia's creditor banks rejected previous bids by the same four
companies because they included demands for a writeoff of at least
part of Kia's 11.8 trillion won (dlrs 8.4 billion) debt.
	   The creditors had offered to write off interest on that debt
over the next 10 years, an estimated 6.5 trillion won (dlrs 4.6
billion), but none of the principle.
	   Thursday, however, the creditors said they would write off 2.9
trillion won (dlrs 2.1 billion) of the principle debt along with
any interest on the remainder.
	   Kia and its creditors said the successful bidder must buy at
least 51 percent of the equity of Kia and its commercial vehicle
subsidiary, Asia Motors Corp. Ford already owns 16.9 percent of
Kia.
	   The move to sell Kia is part of the government's effort to
restructure its battered economy under a dlrs 58 billion bailout
from the International Monetary Fund.
	   Kia's collapse in July 1997 helped erode investor confidence in
South Korea's bloated, inefficient industries, leading to a flight
of capital.
	   Kia and Asia have 7.7 trillion won (dlrs 5.7 billion) in assets.
Kia produced 780,000 cars in 1997. Asia Motors can turn out 250,000
vehicles, mostly trucks and buses. The two companies employ more
than 18,000 workers.

Singh: A major winner and everyday player
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OAKVILLE, Ontario (AP) _ Vijay Singh, you've just won your first
major championship. What are you going to do next?
	   Taking time off to celebrate winning the PGA Championship
apparently was not on the agenda.
	   Tiger Woods won the Masters and disappeared for a month. Singh
won the PGA at Sahalee Country Club and can't stay away.
	   He went straight to Colorado for the Sprint International, then
on to the World Series of Golf. Milwaukee was just up the road, so
why not?
	   When the Canadian Open opened Thursday at Glen Abbey Golf Club,
Singh planned to tee it up for the sixth week in a row. That's
quite a stretch of golf, until you consider that he played seven
straight weeks earlier this year.
	   ``I don't feel tired,'' Singh said with a shrug. ``It hasn't
bothered me. And I'm playing well.''
	   No doubt about that.
	   Singh followed up his PGA victory by making it two in a row at
the International. He finished in a tie for 14th at the World
Series and then had his worst finish in 11 tournaments, a tie for
42nd at the Greater Milwaukee Open.
	   ``I'm going to have a week off next week,'' he said with a hint
of apology in his voice.
	   If he's not on the practice range, the hardest-working man in
golf may be able to take a few minutes to consider the six-week
stretch that has thrust him to No. 3 on the money list and into the
top 10 in the world rankings for the first time in his career.
	   And maybe he'll have time to finally watch the videotape of the
final round at Sahalee _ the approach that ricocheted out of the
trees and onto the green on the par-5 11th, the wedge he hooked
from 50 yards deep in the trees onto the green at No. 14, the par
putt on No. 17 that gave him a 2-stroke cushion.
	   The tape might also reveal the even temperament that enables
Singh to treat every tournament the same. When the final putt fell
at Sahalee, he simply smiled and waved his hand. He had just won
one of golf's biggest prizes, but looked like he already was trying
to sort through the Stableford scoring system used at the
International.
	   ``I don't get too excited about anything,'' he said. ``I haven't
yet, anyway.''
	   The only emotion Singh showed Wednesday was when he was asked
how he managed to keep playing so well after the distractions of
winning his first major _ more time with the media, more autographs
to be signed.
	   Singh twirled his putter for everyone to see and smiled.
	   ``This thing here,'' he said.
	   The Canadian Open, the third-oldest national championship in the
world behind the British Open and U.S. Open, doesn't have near the
strength of field it did last year at Montreal. A year ago, Steve
Jones held off the likes of Greg Norman, Davis Love III and Justin
Leonard, and Tiger Woods missed the cut for the first time in his
professional career.
	   Back at the Abbey, this year's Open looks more like the B.C.
Open. Only two of the top 10 players on the money list are here _
Jim Furyk and, of course, Singh.
	   ``Greg Norman is hurt,'' Singh said, running down the list of
no-shows. ``I don't know why Tiger didn't come, or Lee Janzen or
Mark O'Meara. Some guys have had good seasons, and a lot of guys
will probably be traveling overseas.''
	   Singh will save most of his international travel until after the
season-ending Tour Championship. He'll play one tournament in Asia,
the Grand Slam of Golf for the winners of this year's majors, and
then the Presidents Cup.
	   ``We just want to go out and win it,'' he said.
	   One of his teammates on the International team is in Canada this
week, but Ernie Els of South Africa hasn't been able to keep up
quite the rigorous schedule. While Singh is at the Abbey because it
was on his schedule, Els added the Canadian Open out of necessity.
	   Plagued by an aching back since June, Els has taken the entire
summer off except for the three majors and Loch Lomond, which
served as a tune-up for the British Open.
	   The Sprint and the World Series gave him 14 tournaments, one
short of the minimum to keep his PGA Tour membership. Now, Els may
add yet another tournament _ the Disney Classic _ to help him get
into the top 30 on the money list and qualify for the Tour
Championship.
	   Els is 31st in money, only dlrs 175 behind Trevor Dodds, but
needing by his own estimate about dlrs 140,000 to secure his place
in the top 30 for a fifth straight year.
	   ``I didn't make a lot of money because I didn't play that
much,'' Els said. ``I missed out on my summer run, and that's
probably why I'm in this situation.''

Gambia's president flies to Libya in violation of U.N. sanctions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Gambian president has flown to Libya,
becoming the latest of several African presidents to violate the
U.N. air embargo against the North African country, Egypt's
official news agency reported Thursday.
	   President Yaya Jammeh arrived in the Libyan capital of Tripoli
on Wednesday and met Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, the Middle East
News Agency reported.
	   During his visit of several days, Jammeh will take part in the
extended celebrations of the 29th anniversary of the coup that
brought Gadhafi to power, MENA said.
	   Last Saturday _ the anniversary _ the presidents of Sudan, Chad,
Niger, Mali and the Central African Republic flew to Libya in
violation of U.N. Security Council sanctions that ban direct
flights to and from Libya.
	   The council imposed the embargo in 1992 in a bid to force Libya
to hand over for trail two suspects wanted for the 1988 bombing of
an American airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, that left 270 people
dead.
	   Libyan sources told MENA that Jammeh's flight was ``an
implementation of the last African summit resolutions.''
	   The Organization of African Unity decided at its June summit to
no longer abide by the sanctions when travel was required for
humanitarian activities or official business.
	   A delegation of legislators from Chad also violated the
sanctions Wednesday by flying to Tripoli from the Chadian capital
of N'Djamena, MENA reported.
	   Until recently most statesmen and officials have respected the
embargo by flying to Tunisia and crossing overland into Libya.

Most Asian markets lower on Wall Street losses, weaker yen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A weakening Japanese yen, overnight losses on
Wall Street and a host of local worries _ from escalating riots in
Indonesia to lingering concern over the ailing financial system in
Japan _ dragged Asian markets lower Thursday.
	   News of the Bank of Japan's interest rate cut, a move usually
welcomed by equities markets because it cuts borrowing costs for
companies, failed to boost regional bourses. Share prices in the
top three Asian markets, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore, were all
lower at midday.
	   Analysts said the minuscule cut indicated Japan isn't ready to
take more drastic steps to save its bleeding economy, and that hurt
regional market sentiment.
	   Investors also fear the rate cut, the first in three years, and
the ensuing fall in the yen early Thursday will bring more
instability to the already battered regional currencies.
	   ``I think the situation (in Asia) is tense because there is a
bit of volatility in the yen and people are still contemplating the
socio-political problems across the regions, primarily in Malaysia
and Indonesia,'' said Andrew Fernow, research director for Vickers
Ballas in Hong Kong.
	   The 1.9 percent drop overnight in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average also added selling pressure, he said.
	   ``Markets will basically retreat due to a lack of incentives.
There isn't a lot of reason to buy at the moment,'' he said.
	   Late Wednesday, the BOJ decided it will nudge overnight call
money rates, the rates banks charge each other to borrow money
overnight without collateral, lower to around 0.25 percent from the
previous 0.5 percent, a measure taken to prevent Japan's economy
from falling into a deflationary spiral.
	   The news edged share prices in Japan higher in early trading,
but the excitement wore off quickly and selling resumed amid
persistent worries about the bad loans burdening Japan's banks and
the recent turbulence in global financial markets.
	   The Nikkei Average of 255 selected issues was at 14,704 in early
afternoon, off 0.3 percent.
	   In early afternoon trading, the dollar was at 135.03, above
132.35 in Tokyo late Wednesday, but below 136.85 in New York
overnight.
	   In Singapore, the Straits Times Index was down 2.1 percent at
the midday close, mostly on currency fears stemming from Japan's
rate cut.
	   Hong Kong's volatile blue-chip Hang Seng Index was down off 0.17
percent at 7,892.37 at the midday.
	   In Malaysia, the blue-chip Composite index skidded 3.4 percent
as short-term retail investors took profits from Wednesday's rise,
while foreign funds stayed sidelined, frustrated with the
ever-changing market rules since the government slapped currency
and equities controls last week.
	   In Indonesia, the JSX Composite Index opened a touch higher in
quiet trading, but investors were cautious amid rising concerns
about political instability as widespread riots continued. The
index had reached a five-year low Wednesday.

Students protest in East Timor for rebel leader's release
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Indonesia-Protest

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of students held a peaceful
demonstration outside East Timor's provincial Parliament Thursday
and demanded freedom for a jailed guerrilla leader.
	   Dozens of recently freed political prisoners joined in the
protest in Dili, the capital of the former Portuguese colony that
Indonesia invaded in 1975.
	   The demonstrators demanded the release of more political
prisoners including Xanana Gusmao, a separatist leader who was
arrested in 1992 and is serving a 20-year term in Jakarta's
Cipinang penitentiary.
	   East Timor, about 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) east of
Jakarta, has endured years of social unrest, guerrilla warfare and
human rights abuses since Indonesia annexed the territory in 1976.
	   The United Nations does not recognize the annexation but is
sponsoring negotiations between Indonesia and Portugal with the aim
of securing a peaceful future for East Timor.
	   President B.J. Habibie, who replaced former autocratic President
Suharto in May, has released dozens of political prisoners in East
Timor and other parts of Indonesia.
	   He has also offered to release Gusmao and grant some autonomy to
East Timor in return for international recognition that the
territory is part of Indonesia.
	   Meanwhile 31 political prisoners being held in Becora jail are
continuing an 11-day hunger strike in support of demands for
Gusmao's release.
	   Activists said seven have been given medical treatment.

North Koreans in Japan report harassment because of missile launch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Koreans in Japan have been the target of death
threats and other forms of harassment since North Korea launched a
ballistic missile over Japan last week, a Korean residents' group
said Thursday.
	   In the worst case, 20 schools for ethnic Koreans living in the
Tokyo area had to check their water supplies after an anonymous
caller said he had poisoned them with cyanide, according to So
Chong On, a spokesman for the General Association of Korean
Residents in Japan.
	   No trace of poison was found, but the incident was particularly
frightening because it comes amid a national scare over a recent
string of poisonings across the country, So said.
	   So said schools and offices run by Koreans loyal to the North
have also received threats of kidnapping or murder and children now
commute in groups for safety.
	   He said envelopes containing razor blades and letters
threatening murder have been mailed to North Korean organizations
and ultra-rightists shout anti-North slogans through loudspeakers
near schools.
	   So, whose group is closely affiliated with North Korea, said a
girl in a traditional Korean school uniform was hit in the head
with an umbrella and spat upon by a man on a bicycle last Tuesday,
the day after the missile launch.
	   He said no other injuries or damages have been reported,
however.
	   ``We are angered by the harassment targeted at innocent
children,'' he said.
	   The North's launch last week, which it claims was conducted to
put a satellite in orbit, caused an uproar in Japan. The missile
passed over northern Japan, indicating the North has gained the
technological know-how to hit any major Japanese city.
	   About 640,000 Koreans live in Japan, many of whom were born
here. About 180,000 are believed to loyal to the North, though
there is no official tally.

ASEAN ministers agree to accept truck, bus inspections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURINDA KEYS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Nine Southeast Asian nations agreed Thursday to
stop requiring inspection certificates for buses and freight trucks
crossing each other's territory in a step aimed at saving time and
money in the midst of the regional economic crisis.
	   The agreement signed by transport ministers of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations at the end of their three-day annual
meeting is part of a series of moves to reduce the mass of rules
governing transportation within the region.
	   No estimate has been made of how much the regulations cost in
time and money.
	   But at a news conference, Malaysia's deputy transport minister,
Wira Mohamed Ali Rustam, gave an example. He said his country
requires commercial vehicle inspections every six months. They cost
60 ringgit (dlrs 15.79) and take a half-hour to complete.
	   While the economic crisis has dampened demand for transport
services, ``the ministers agreed that there was a greater urgency
to enhance the region's economic competitiveness through closer
economic cooperation,'' they said in a joint press release.
	   The first step in implementing the agreement will be for
officials to work out compromises on the different criteria and
standards of inspection, said Singapore's Communications Minister
Mah Bow Tan, who hosted the meeting.
	   The new agreement only covers vehicles passing through a
country, not stopping there to deliver or pick up goods and
passengers. Those activities are now covered by scores of bilateral
agreements among the member states: Brunei, Burma, Laos, Malaysia,
Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand.
	   The ministers agreed that their officials would work on
concluding and implementing a separate agreement on state-to-state
transport by the year 2000.
	   A general ``Framework Agreement on the Facilitation of Goods in
Transit'' is to be signed by the ASEAN leaders at a Dec. 15-16
summit in Hanoi, Vietnam.
	   Singapore's Mah said it is aimed at simplifying all the
procedures and most of the regulations that now govern the movement
of goods across ASEAN borders to ``eventually minimize all delays
and restrictions.''
	   The ministers also agreed:
	   _To urgently set up a task force to look into the year 2000
computer bug problem in air traffic control and airport systems.
	   _To study in detail the liberalization of air freight services,
but not air passenger services, within ASEAN.
	   _To study cooperation in maritime training.
	   _To form a working group to look into development of the ASEAN
cruise industry.
	   _To strengthen port cooperation.
	   _To look into sustainable urban transport development and road
safety.

Indonesia central bank governor rules out capital controls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia has no plans to implement
capital controls similar to those imposed in neighboring Malaysia,
central bank Governor Sjahril Sabirin said Thursday.
	   Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a parliamentary
hearing, Sjahril said Indonesia used such controls in the past but
found they did not work.
	   Indonesia, like other Southeast Asian nations, is enduring its
worst economic crisis in years, partially triggered by a dramatic
fall in the value of its currency, the rupiah.
	   Indonesia is now in the process of reforming its battered
economy in line with a multi-billion dollar reform program put
forward by the International Monetary Fund.
	   The governor said his rejection of capital controls was not
simply based on the presence of the IMF.
	   ``It's not because of the IMF,'' he said. ``It's because we had
already had that experience before and it didn't work well.''
	   Since Malaysia implemented sweeping capital controls last week,
market participants have speculated that Indonesia may follow suit
with some form of controlled system, although the government and
Bank Indonesia officials deny this.
	   Indonesia operated a form of foreign exchange control during the
late 1960s and early 1970s. That system led to a black market in
foreign currency and smuggling, and the central bank eventually
abandoned it.
	   Meanwhile Sjahril said the central bank was exchanging between
dlrs 5 million and dlrs 15 million a day for rupiah in the spot
market. He said the funds were part of international lending to
Indonesia. The governor said this wasn't market intervention,
however.
	   ``The bank is not intervening, just supplying money to the
market for exports or imports,'' Sjahril said.
	   He said the amount of dollars supplied to the market daily will
depend on the amount of foreign aid released.

Officials forced to change draw
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Commonwealth Games officials were
forced to drastically alter the draw for the three-day rugby union
sevens competition Thursday following the withdrawal of two teams.
	   Gambia and Zimbabwe pulled out of rugby, changing the structure
from five pools of four teams to three pools of six.
	   The new draw features seedings all through the draw with top six
teams being Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, South Africa, England and
Western Samoa.
	   The tournament will still take place from Saturday to Monday.
	   The redraw takes the pressure off Australia, which was in Fiji's
pool for the initial draw.
	   Australia will now face the Cook Islands and the Cayman Islands
in the first stage, while world champions Fiji have drawn Wales and
Swaziland.
	   England, which is sending a team devoid of test players, has to
meet Tonga and Kenya, South Africa faces Papua New Guinea and
Trinidad and Tobago and New Zealand has an easy draw against Sri
Lanka and Malaysia.
	   The pools will be redrawn after the first round on Saturday with
the teams then ranked depending on first stage results. After a
second round-robin series the top eight teams will contest the
finals.

Iraq reacts to UN suspension of sanctions review
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A leading Iraqi newspaper reacted Thursday
to the U.N. Security Council's decision to suspend sanctions
reviews, saying the move was ``neither strange nor a surprise.''
	   Iraqi media, which is closely controlled, seemed to be waiting
for instructions Thursday morning on how to respond to the
suspension. National radio and television did not even mention the
Security Council's decision and government spokesmen declined to
comment.
	   The Security Council voted unanimously Wednesday to suspend the
six monthly reviews of the comprehensive trade sanctions imposed on
Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The council's move retaliated for Iraq's decision Aug. 5 to
withdraw cooperation with U.N. inspectors seeking to check the
elimination of Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction.
	   The newspaper Babil, which is owned by the son of President
Saddam Hussein, was the only publication to react to the suspension
early Thursday.
	   Its editorial said the move was ``neither strange nor a surprise
because the understanding is that the sanctions will continue until
the United Nations, with the United States behind it, feel that
they are losing more than they are winning.''
	   The newspaper tried to link the sanctions to Israel, saying Iraq
was ``the spearhead against a (Middle East peace) settlement and
all the Zionist schemes to weaken any country which is outside this
political equation.
	   ``This proves that Zionism is the key to the sanctions on Iraq
(being lifted),'' the editorial added.
	   The council's stand hardens the lines between the world body and
the Iraqi government over the 8-year sanctions regime. President
Saddam Hussein promised earlier this year to have the embargo
lifted by early 1999.
	   But the council also gave Iraq an incentive to change its mind.
It agreed to conduct a ``comprehensive review'' of sanctions after
Iraq lets inspectors go back to work. Such a move could force the
council to acknowledge Iraq's progress of ridding itself of weapons
of mass destruction while generating pressure for a lifting of
sanctions.
	   U.N. arms experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the council will lift sanctions, which were imposed after
Iraq invaded Kuwait.
	   Iraq withdrew cooperation by refusing to provide the U.N.
inspectors with escorts, whose presence is essential to conduct
inspections.

Angry crowds grow larger, rowdier after police shoot protester
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with marches, opposition legislator
prevented from leaving country. Trims
 &UR; AP Photos PHN101-112
 &UR; By ROBIN McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Police fired gunshots point-blank
into a crowd of protesters Thursday demanding the ouster of
strongman Hun Sen, critically wounding a student in the fourth day
of violent clashes.
	   After initially dispersing, the protesters regrouped and
regained momentum, dashing on motorcycles and on foot to different
parts of the capital, including the Angkor-style Independence
Monument. They were increasingly rowdy and the potential for more
violence increased.
	   An opposition legislator, Khem Sokha, was prevented from leaving
the country when he tried to catch a flight at Phnom Penh's
airport. Hun Sen said earlier this week that several opponents
would be barred from leaving country. They have described
themselves as hostages.
	   The shooting occurred shortly after several hundred people
gathered outside the U.S. Embassy and the residence of opposition
leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh, a new focal point of unrest since
a protest camp was destroyed Tuesday.
	   About 40 club-wielding riot police arrived, first smashing a
makeshift shrine erected where two Buddhist monks were shot by
police Wednesday. Protesters rebuilt it as soon as they left. The
police returned to destroy it again. A few rocks were thrown.
	   Five police opened fire with Kalashnikov rifles, two of them
firing straight into the crowd. A student, Tour Khunnaruth, 18, was
struck in the neck and rushed in an embassy car to a hospital,
where his mother said later his condition was critical.
	   Reports that a monk died in violence Wednesday cannot be
confirmed, but Cambodians believe several were killed, escalating
anger against Hun Sen following disputed national elections July
26.
	   The Association of Southeast Asian Nations urged both sides to
``exercise restraint, avoid violence, including extremists acts,
and resolve their problems through dialogue and consultations in
order to prevent further deterioration of the situation.''
	   ASEAN urged all sides to accept the elections, in which Hun Sen
won a slight parliamentary majority but lacks the two-thirds needed
to form a new government. The opposition alleges massive fraud and
is withholding support.
	   ASEAN, which postponed Cambodia's membership after Hun Sen
deposed Ranariddh in a coup last year, noted that the international
community had endorsed the vote as sufficiently free and fair.
	   The verdict was disputed on the streets.
	   ``They're trying to crush democracy by arms,'' said Sengta Damy,
26, a law student. ``We're very angry at the soldiers. We want an
end to dictatorship and corruption.''
	   Security forces played cat-and-mouse with the protesters after
the shooting, pushing them out of the neighborhood and patrolling
the area with truckloads of troops, then allowing them to return.
	   The numbers of protesters swelled to more than 500, and they
appeared to be looking for a fight. Shops were closed.
	   ``Who is the dictator?'' chanting leaders shouted.
	   ``Hun Sen!'' the crowd replied.
	   ``Who is the murderer?''
	   ``Hun Sen!''
	   They eventually left the U.S. Embassy neighborhood and traveled
to the U.N. Center for Human Rights, then marched toward the
Independence Monument.
	   But they appeared to lack clear leadership now that opposition
leader Sam Rainsy, a master at public protest, is threatened with
arrest and seeking refuge at the local U.N. offices.
	   Weeks of relatively peaceful protest turned violent when Hun Sen
cracked down Monday after grenades were thrown at his house. He
blamed Sam Rainsy, who has called the attack a ``ridiculous
pretext'' to smash weeks of hitherto peaceful protests.
	   Lakhan Mehrotra, the U.N.'s special envoy, met Ranariddh's
father, King Norodom Sihanouk, on Wednesday and returned with a
proposal for new talks including the U.N., electoral officials and
the major parties.
	   Ranariddh unilaterally made two concessions Wednesday, dropping
demands for a recount of ballots and revoting in some areas. But he
held firm to demands that the opposition be given more
parliamentary seats in reflection of their greater share of the
popular vote.
	   Ranariddh called for a massive peaceful rally Sunday. The
Interior Ministry quickly denied permission.

American satellites destroyed in Russian launch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A rocket launched by Russia to put 12 U.S.
commercial satellites into orbit failed minutes after blast-off on
Thursday and burned up in the atmosphere along with its cargo,
officials said.
	   The Ukrainian-made Zenit-2 booster was launched by Russian space
forces from the Baikonur cosmodrome which Moscow rents from the
former Soviet republic of Kazakstan shortly after midnight.
	   In the fifth minute of flight the rocket's control system
failed, shutting down the engines.
	   Fragments of the rocket and the Globalstar satellites, built by
the Space Systems Loral company, fell in a deserted area in
southern Siberia, the Russian Space Agency said in a statement
carried by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   An official investigation was started.
	   The contract's value wasn't announced, but a usual price for
such launches stands at around dlrs 30 million, the report said.
	   Five more launches are planned by mid-1999 to put 36 more
Globalstar satellites into orbit. Two Zenit-2 rockets will carry 12
satellites each, and another 12 satellites will be put into orbit
by three of Russia's Soyuz rockets.
	   Thursday's launch the eighth failure of the two-stage Zenit-2
out of a total of 31, but Russian and Ukrainian officials declare
it the best in its class and have ambitious plans for the booster.
	   The same rocket, equipped with the third stage, is to be used in
the Sea Launch international program which would carry out
commercial launches from sea platforms.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ At the end of one cul-de-sac in a posh
Kuala Lumpur suburb, the growing crowds chanting ``Reformasi!''
have become a national spectacle.
	   At first hundreds, now thousands have descended on the home of
ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim every night since his
dismissal last week, some to support his reform campaign _ many
just to witness the show.
	   ``I came to see the fiesta,'' said Cheng Poh Hand, a corporate
lawyer, seated beneath a blue-and-white striped tent top on a
leather couch, doubling as lawn furniture on Anwar's back porch.
	   Anwar was sacked as finance and deputy prime minister and
expelled from the ruling party on lurid allegations ranging from
sexual misconduct with men and women to treason.
	   Since then he has held nightly rallies, often preaching barefoot
atop a coffee table, asserting his innocence and outlining his
campaign for political reform.
	   Anwar's residence, a spacious, white-stucco duplex, has been
transformed into a political command post where he mingles with
supporters _ many equipped with instamatic cameras to pose with the
fallen leader _ and journalists, staked out round-the-clock,
listening for police sirens.
	   For days, Anwar has said he fears his imminent arrest. But Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Thursday that police would avoid
arresting Anwar to prevent international media from labeling
Malaysia as ``repressive.''
	   Unable to read about Anwar's speeches in the pro-government
local press, Malaysians, many of whom traveled to Kuala Lumpur from
other states in country, have converged on Anwar's home to hear his
story firsthand.
	   University students distribute photocopies of foreign news
articles downloaded from the Internet to the crowd mixed with
political supporters, middle-class businessmen and housewives
clutching their children's hands.
	   ``Most of them, they want to hear his speech, what he has to
say,'' said Azman Ali Mohamad, a financial consultant, gesturing at
the more than 6,000 people spilling into the upscale neighborhood
around Anwar's home during a recent speech. ``I came to see him,
his house _ and all this.''
	   Mercedes and motorbikes jammed the usually quiet streets,
prowling for parking spots. Unable to enter Anwar's tightly-packed
backyard, onlookers crouched on the high stucco walls surrounding
his home. Others, craning their necks to see, held tape recorders
or video cameras in Anwar's general direction.
	   Vendors outside hawked bottled water with a sign that read:
``Reformation Water'' and bootlegged cassettes and videotapes of
Anwar's fiery speeches from the past week. One vendor estimated he
had sold 5,000 cassettes in four days.
	   The Domino's Pizza around the corner extended business hours
from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m. to feed the massive flow of customers.
	   To secure a good seat, onlookers have taken to arriving several
hours early and making themselves at home on Anwar's living room
couches or on plastic chairs lining his torn-up lawn.
	   A cluster of men on a recent afternoon sat in the backyard
watching a professional wrestling match on a giant-screen TV set up
to view back videotapes of Anwar's speeches.

Estrada wants proof Imelda Marcos will pay victims of human rights
</HEADLINE>
abuse

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said Thursday the widow of dictator Ferdinand Marcos should put
into writing an offer to pay dlrs 150 million to victims of human
rights abuses under her husband's rule.
	   ``She only made a verbal promise, and I believe the amount is
too small. Considering there are so many of them, the victims will
just get a small amount,'' Estrada said in a radio interview.
	   Imelda Marcos said earlier this week she is willing to pay dlrs
150 million to 9,539 Filipinos who won a class action suit in a
Hawaii court against the Marcos estate for human rights violations.
	   The former first lady said she is offering the money ``out of
compassion, not guilt.''
	   She has denied that her husband was responsible for torture,
summary executions and disappearances of political opponents and
dissidents.
	   The money would be taken from dlrs 540 million in Marcos' Swiss
bank deposits, which were frozen by Swiss authorities in 1986 and
recently transferred into an escrow account in a Philippine bank.
	   The Swiss deposits are being claimed by the government, Mrs.
Marcos and the human rights plaintiffs, who were awarded dlrs 2
billion in damages by the Hawaii court.
	   The Swiss Federal Supreme Court has ruled that the money can be
released to the Philippine government if Mrs. Marcos is convicted
of criminal wrongdoing in connection with the deposits and if the
human rights victims are compensated. An out-of-court settlement
with the Marcoses could also free the funds.
	   Estrada, a former Marcos supporter, said officials will study
the legal implications of Mrs. Marcos' offer.
	   Presidential Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora has held
separate talks with representatives of two rival groups among the
human rights plaintiffs in an effort to work out a procedure for
dividing the Marcos money.
	   One group, Selda, a group of former political detainees,
proposed that one-third of the Swiss accounts be given to the
Marcos victims before the government and the Marcos family
negotiate a division of the remainder.
	   Another group, Claimants 1081, represented by their American
lawyer, Robert Swift, say compensation should be paid through the
Hawaii court.
	   Swift said there was an ``understanding'' between him and Zamora
``that that is the only way that compensation could be paid out
from the escrow.''
	   Zamora, however, said no agreement has been reached with either
group.
	   Marcos was ousted in a ``people power'' revolt in February 1986
and fled to Hawaii where he died three years later.
	   He denied any wrongdoing during his 20-year administration,
including charges that the Swiss bank accounts were part of what
the government says is billions of dollars of ill-gotten wealth.

Canadian player back after suffering severed finger
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Canadian field hockey sweeper
Lauralee Kopeck was back in action Thursday just four days after
losing the top of her finger in a Commonwealth Games trial match.
	   Kopeck had the top of her little finger sliced off when it was
caught between her hockey stick and a fast moving ball.
	   Team doctor Peter Fowler sewed the missing piece back onto
Kopeck's finger after Canadian officials found it on the playing
field.
	   ``She was defending a short corner and an opponent smashed the
ball, it hit her little finger and sheared off the end of it,''
Fowler said Thursday. ``The doctor at the game saw the bone exposed
and sent her to our clinic at the village in an ambulance. After
the game, they found her finger on the field, brought it around and
we sewed it back on.''
	   Fowler said that although the section of finger had died,
Kopeck's operation was successful.
	   ``She's playing in tonight's match,'' Fowler said. ``She wanted
to play yesterday but I guess the team figured they had the
opposition under control.''
	   Kopeck, whose nickname is Jumbo, warmed up with the Canadian
team before its 3-0 win over Namibia on Wednesday.
	   Team leader Margie Schuett used Kopeck, a veteran of two World
Cups and the 1992 Olympics, as an example of the Canadian spirit in
the face of questioning over the withdrawals of several big name
talents.
	   Canada's world 100-meter record holder Donovan Bailey and fellow
sprint star Bruny Surin have decided not to compete here after a
long season while Olympic swim medalist Curtis Myden has stayed
away to study.
	   ``This kid hasn't winced, hasn't whined, hasn't complained,''
said Schuett. ``She has her finger taken off and goes right back
out there and competes again.''

Iraq reacts to U.N. suspension of sanctions review
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A leading Iraqi newspaper reacted Thursday
to the U.N. Security Council's decision to suspend periodic
sanctions reviews, saying the move was ``neither strange nor a
surprise.''
	   Iraqi media, which is closely controlled by the government,
seemed to be waiting for instructions Thursday morning on how to
respond to the suspension. National radio and television did not
even mention the Security Council's decision and government
spokesmen declined to comment.
	   The Security Council voted unanimously Wednesday to suspend the
reviews of the comprehensive trade sanctions that have crippled the
Iraqi economy. The sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
	   The resolution suspends a major, 6-month review scheduled for
October, and all subsequent 60-day reviews until Iraq resumes
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The council's move retaliated for Iraq's decision Aug. 5 to
withdraw its cooperation with U.N. inspectors seeking to check
whether Baghdad has destroyed its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The newspaper Babil, which is owned by the son of President
Saddam Hussein, was the only publication to react to the suspension
early Thursday.
	   Its editorial said the move was ``neither strange nor a surprise
because the understanding is that the sanctions will continue until
the United Nations, with the United States behind it, feel that
they are losing more than they are winning.''
	   The newspaper tried to link the sanctions to Israel, saying Iraq
was ``the spearhead against a (Middle East peace) settlement and
all the Zionist schemes to weaken any country which is outside this
political equation.
	   ``This proves that Zionism is the key to the sanctions on Iraq
(being lifted),'' the editorial added.
	   The council's stand hardens the lines between the world body and
the Iraqi government over the 8-year sanctions regime. Saddam
promised earlier this year to have the embargo lifted by early
1999.
	   But the council also gave Iraq an incentive to change its mind.
It agreed to conduct a ``comprehensive review'' of sanctions after
Iraq lets inspectors go back to work. Such a move could force the
council to acknowledge Iraq's progress in ridding itself of its
weapons of mass destruction while generating pressure for a lifting
of sanctions.
	   U.N. arms experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
capabilities before the council will lift sanctions, which were
imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
	   Iraq withdrew cooperation with inspectors after the chief
inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify that Iraq had
destroyed its banned weapons. The inspections cannot take place
unless Iraqi escorts accompany inspectors.

Names of 229 crash victims read one by one at memorial service

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Many mourners wept as names of the
229 victims were read one by one during a memorial service for
those who died aboard Swissair Flight 111.
	   Political leaders, rescue workers and hundreds of local
residents joined grieving family members for the service, held
Wednesday at a school sports field in Indian Harbour, one of the
towns near the North Atlantic site where the plane crashed Sept. 2.
	   In attendance were Canadian Minister Jean Chretien, Swiss
President Flavio Cotti and U.S. Ambassador Gordon Giffin. More than
130 Americans died in the crash.
	   Among the speakers was the Rev. Richard Walsh, an Anglican
pastor whose parish includes Peggy's Cove, the tiny fishing village
close to the crash site that now is base for a search and recovery
operation.
	   ``To the families, your loved ones are spiritually part of our
community,'' Walsh said. ``We will never forget them, we will
always remember.''
	   Claire Mortimer, whose father, John Mortimer, was killed in the
crash, thanked the local community on behalf of victims' families.
	   ``Your grace, and your generosity, and your compassion mean so
much to us,'' said Mortimer. ``Your outpouring of help will never
be forgotten.''
	   Moments later, Mortimer sobbed quietly as a helicopter dropped a
wreath over St. Margaret's Bay.
	   Offshore from Peggy's Cove, search operations were slowed
Wednesday by rough seas, but authorities expressed hope that divers
would soon be back on the ocean floor seeking the plane's cockpit
voice recorder and pieces of the fuselage.
	   The USS Grapple, a Navy salvage ship that helped raise sections
of TWA Flight 800 when it crashed in 1996 near Long Island, arrived
Wednesday from Philadelphia to assist in the recovery of Swissair
wreckage.
	   In New York, a dlrs 50 million lawsuit over the crash was filed
Wednesday by former boxing champion Jake LaMotta, whose son,
Joseph, was among those killed. The suit alleges that the crash was
caused by technical defects in the aircraft.
	   The suit names as defendants Swissair; its partner, Delta
Airlines; McDonnell Douglas, which manufactured the aircraft; and
Boeing Co., which now owns McDonnell Douglas.
	   Speculation about the cause of the crash continues, with several
aviation experts blaming Kapton, which is widely used as insulation
in commercial jets.
	   The U.S. military banned the use of Kapton 11 years ago because
it was prone to breakdown.
	   The crash occurred about 90 minutes after the plane left Kennedy
International Airport for Geneva, Switzerland, when the aircraft
was attempting to make an emergency landing at Halifax but fell
into the sea some 30 miles (50 kilometers) away.

Lawyers make final appeal to keep Imelda Marcos out of jail
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CLARO CORTES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Lawyers for Imelda Marcos made their
final appeal Thursday before the Philippine Supreme Court to keep
the widow of the former leader from serving a 12-year jail term for
graft.
	   In 1993, Mrs. Marcos was found to have violated the anti-graft
law on two counts involving the lease of government property and
sentenced to up to 24 years in prison.
	   In January of this year, the high tribunal acquitted the widow
of dictator Ferdinand Marcos of one charge but upheld her
conviction in the second charge, which carried a maximum prison
term of 12 years. She was also fined 189 million pesos (dlrs 4.3
million).
	   Mrs. Marcos and former Transportation Minister Jose Dans were
accused of entering into five ``unfavorable'' contracts involving
the government-run commuter railway and the private Philippine
General Hospital Foundation.
	   Each faced two corruption charges stemming from the award of
leases on property owned by the rail line to the hospital
foundation at favorable rates. Dans was acquitted.
	   The court, however, allowed Mrs. Marcos, 68, to appeal the
ruling one final time.
	   She is free on bail.
	   On Thursday, the court heard oral arguments of Mrs. Marcos'
lawyers and state prosecutors.
	   During the hearing, former Marcos solicitor-general Estelito
Mendoza argued that since Dans was acquitted, Mrs. Marcos alone
could not be convicted of conspiracy.
	   He also said Mrs. Marcos, who signed the deal as chairman of the
hospital foundation could not be tried by the anti-graft court
which was specifically tasked to try government officials.
	   He said Mrs. Marcos did not personally benefit from the deal.
Prosecutors did not challenge this argument, but they maintained
the lease amount should have been higher.
	   The prosecution said the deal Mrs. Marcos made was ``manifestly
and grossly disadvantageous to the government.''
	   Government lawyers said Dans could not have signed the deal
without Mrs. Marcos' approval since she was also the chairman of
the railway system.
	   Government lawyers told the Supreme Court that Mrs. Marcos
granted leases on government-owned land at very low rates to
benefit a hospital foundation she also headed.
	   ``No comment,'' Mrs. Marcos said after the three-hour hearing by
the entire 14-member bench.
	   The court gave her lawyers and prosecutors 10 days to file the
summary of their arguments.
	   President-elect Joseph Estrada has indicated he favors a pardon
or dismissal of the case against Mrs. Marcos.
	   The case is the only one in which Mrs. Marcos, 68, has been
convicted on corruption charges, although she faces numerous other
criminal and civil cases related to the 20-year strongman rule of
her husband.
	   She and her late husband have been accused of stealing billions
of dollars during his presidency. They were ousted in a 1986
``people power'' revolt, and Marcos died three years later in exile
in Hawaii.

	   In San Diego, Greg Vaughn hit his 48th homer and Steve Finley
had a solo shot as San Diego tied a franchise record with its 92nd
victory.
	   The Padres snapped a three-game losing streak and reduced their
magic number to four for winning their second NL West title in
three seasons. They also avoided being swept for the first time
this season.
	   The game was punctuated by a wild eighth inning, when San
Francisco reliever Julian Tavarez was ejected for reacting angrily
after walking Chris Gomez. Tavarez slammed his glove to the ground,
tossed his cap toward the plate and ended up chest-to-chest with
umpire Sam Holbrook before being pulled away by manager Dusty
Baker.
	   After Tavarez was ejected, the Padres scored four runs on four
walks and Carlos Hernandez's two-run single. Trevor Hoffman earned
his major league-leading 47th save for San Diego.

Lawyers make final appeal to keep Imelda Marcos out of jail

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Lawyers for Imelda Marcos made their
final appeal Thursday before the Philippine Supreme Court to keep
the widow of the former leader from serving a 12-year jail term for
graft.
	   In 1993, Mrs. Marcos was found to have violated the anti-graft
law on two counts involving the lease of government property and
sentenced to up to 24 years in prison.
	   In January of this year, the high tribunal acquitted the widow
of dictator Ferdinand Marcos of one charge but upheld her
conviction in the second charge, which carried a maximum prison
term of 12 years. She was also fined 189 million pesos (dlrs 4.3
million).
	   Mrs. Marcos and former Transportation Minister Jose Dans were
accused of entering into five ``unfavorable'' contracts involving
the government-run commuter railway and the private Philippine
General Hospital Foundation.
	   Each faced two corruption charges stemming from the award of
leases on property owned by the rail line to the hospital
foundation at favorable rates. Dans was acquitted.
	   The court, however, allowed Mrs. Marcos, 68, to appeal the
ruling one final time.
	   She is free on bail.
	   On Thursday, the court heard oral arguments of Mrs. Marcos'
lawyers and state prosecutors.
	   During the hearing, former Marcos solicitor-general Estelito
Mendoza argued that since Dans was acquitted, Mrs. Marcos alone
could not be convicted of conspiracy.
	   He also said Mrs. Marcos, who signed the deal as chairman of the
hospital foundation could not be tried by the anti-graft court
which was specifically tasked to try government officials.
	   He said Mrs. Marcos did not personally benefit from the deal.
Prosecutors did not challenge this argument, but they maintained
the lease amount should have been higher.
	   The prosecution said the deal Mrs. Marcos made was ``manifestly
and grossly disadvantageous to the government.''
	   Government lawyers said Dans could not have signed the deal
without Mrs. Marcos' approval since she was also the chairman of
the railway system.
	   Government lawyers told the Supreme Court that Mrs. Marcos
granted leases on government-owned land at very low rates to
benefit a hospital foundation she also headed.
	   ``No comment,'' Mrs. Marcos said after the three-hour hearing by
the entire 14-member bench.
	   The court gave her lawyers and prosecutors 10 days to file the
summary of their arguments.
	   President Joseph Estrada has indicated he favors a pardon or
dismissal of the case against Mrs. Marcos.
	   The case is the only one in which Mrs. Marcos, 68, has been
convicted on corruption charges, although she faces numerous other
criminal and civil cases related to the 20-year strongman rule of
her husband.
	   She and her late husband have been accused of stealing billions
of dollars during his presidency. They were ousted in a 1986
``people power'' revolt, and Marcos died three years later in exile
in Hawaii.

40 stray dogs put to sleep in Manila suburb

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Authorities put to sleep 40 stray
dogs Thursday in a campaign against rabies in a Manila suburb.
	   Dr. Jaime Inocencio, a veterinarian of Makati City, metropolitan
Manila's financial center, said one of the dogs was found positive
for rabies and could have infected the others.
	   ``We did this in the most merciful way of euthanizing the
dogs,'' Inocencio said, adding that sedatives and anesthesia were
used.
	   Some of the dogs, which were sickly, had been held at the city
pound for several weeks, said Dr. Vivien Manalastas, another
veterinarian.
	   She said 50 more dogs remain at the pound, but no decision has
been made on whether they will also be put to sleep.
	   She said one teen-age girl died of rabies earlier this year
after being bitten by a dog in the city.
	   Nita Hontiveros-Lichauco, president of the Philippine Animal
Welfare Society, was invited to observe the procedure.
	   ``The sad thing about this is these dogs didn't have to be
here,'' she said. ``We blame the dog owners who don't care.''
	   The dogs were later buried in a common grave at the local
cemetery.

Former dissident gets mixed review on record as president
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By PAULINE JELINEK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ President Kim Dae-jung, a former
dissident and political prisoner, has ``lost touch with the
reality'' of human rights abuses in his own country, a leading
rights group said Thursday.
	   While rights in South Korea have improved in some respects, they
have worsened in others during Kim's six-month administration, said
Pierre Sane, secretary general of London-based Amnesty
International.
	   ``My impression is that to a certain extent, the president has
lost touch with the reality on the ground,'' Sane told a news
conference.
	   ``He says that the National Security Law is not being abused and
will not be abused by his government,'' he added, ``but the
National Security Law is being abused every day _ and every week
new prisoners of conscience are sent to jail.''
	   Kim promised during last year's election campaign to reform the
anti-espionage law, long criticized by rights groups and used by
past authoritarian regimes to suppress political expression.
	   But since Kim came to office, there have been more than 240
arrests under the most controversial section of the law, Sane said.
	   That provision makes it illegal to ``praise or encourage''
communist North Korea and has been interpreted so broadly as to
make possession of Marxist literature a crime.
	   Previous presidents have said it's needed to protect against
continuing hostile northern tactics that have included
infiltrations, assassinations and sabotage since the Korean War
ended 45 years ago with an armistice instead of a peace treaty.
	   Kim's spokesman said the president repeated the assertion
Wednesday in a meeting with Sane, adding that he was unwilling to
battle political conservatives on the issue now, while South Korea
struggles to overcome its worst economic crisis in decades.
	   Sane dismissed both arguments in Thursday's news conference,
calling the economic and security problems ``excuses'' and saying
Kim had failed to make human rights ``a top priority.''
	   Kim has often been compared to South African President Nelson
Mandela because he was jailed repeatedly, exiled and even sentenced
to death once during his 40 years as a pro-democracy leader in
South Korea.
	   ``We are critical even though we recognize that when we discuss
with President Kim, we are discussing with a friend,'' Sane said.
	   ``It is a friendly criticism, but it has to be severe,'' he
said, ``because the lack of action has led to further human rights
violations being committed in the past six months.''
	   Sane said he welcomed two amnesties issued by Kim in which about
150 political prisoners were freed.
	   But he noted they did not include some of the longest-held
prisoners whose release has been sought by local and international
human rights groups.
	   The government also is working to establish a national human
rights commission.
	   But Sane said the legislation is being drafted ``behind closed
doors'' without consultation from human rights organizations.
	   He also said rights abuses among workers have increased with the
arrest of strikers, ``at a time when people want to express their
dissatisfaction and participate in the debate on the future
economic reform in the country.''

Iraq reacts to UN suspension of sanctions review
</HEADLINE>

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A leading Iraqi newspaper reacted Thursday
to the U.N. Security Council's decision to suspend sanctions
reviews, saying the move was ``neither strange nor a surprise.''
	   Iraqi media, which is closely controlled, seemed to be waiting
for instructions Thursday morning on how to respond to the
suspension. National radio and television did not even mention the
Security Council's decision and government spokesmen declined to
comment.
	   The Security Council voted unanimously Wednesday to suspend the
six monthly reviews of the comprehensive trade sanctions imposed on
Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The next review was
scheduled for October.
	   The council's move retaliated for Iraq's decision Aug. 5 to
withdraw cooperation with U.N. inspectors seeking to check the
elimination of Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction.
	   The newspaper Babil, which is owned by a son of President Saddam
Hussein, was the only publication to react to the suspension early
Thursday.
	   Its editorial said the move was ``neither strange nor a surprise
because the understanding is that the sanctions will continue until
the United Nations, with the United States behind it, feel that
they are losing more than they are winning.''
	   The newspaper tried to link the sanctions to Israel, saying Iraq
was ``the spearhead against a (Middle East peace) settlement and
all the Zionist schemes to weaken any country which is outside this
political equation.
	   ``This proves that Zionism is the key to the sanctions on Iraq
(being lifted),'' the editorial added.
	   The council's stand hardens the lines between the world body and
the Iraqi government over the 8-year sanctions regime. Saddam
promised earlier this year to have the embargo lifted by early
1999.
	   But the council also gave Iraq an incentive to change its mind.
It agreed to conduct a ``comprehensive review'' of sanctions after
Iraq lets inspectors go back to work. Such a move could force the
council to acknowledge Iraq's progress of ridding itself of weapons
of mass destruction while generating pressure for a lifting of
sanctions.
	   ``They have left the door open to us,'' Babil commented. In a
reference to Russian, French and Chinese efforts to ease the
sanctions, the editorial said the council needed ``some way to
release the pressure.''
	   ``They have said the sanctions will stay until Iraq agrees to
the return of the inspectors. This means they are taking us back to
the point of disagreement,'' the editorial continued.
	   ``We need an action and not a reaction.''
	   Iraq withdrew cooperation after the chief inspector, Richard
Butler, refused to declare that Iraq had destroyed its banned
weapons. Baghdad stopped providing the U.N. inspectors with their
required Iraqi escorts.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the council will lift the sanctions.

Waters rising, but Bangladeshis have no place to flee

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ With floodwaters threatening to engulf
their homes Thursday, nearly 600,000 Bangladeshis living near the
capital were fearfully looking for safe havens.
	   Momtaz Ahmed, a 50-year-old businessman, hesitated to take his
family to one of the crowded, potentially dangerous refugee camps
that have sprouted up across the country since the worst flooding
in a decade began in July.
	   ``I am trying to leave the area with my family any time today
for a safer place which I have not been able to find yet,'' Ahmed
said.
	   Flood waters have submerged much of this overcrowded delta
nation since monsoon rains began on July 10. The deluge has claimed
more than 850 lives and displaced more than a quarter of the
country's 124 million people. Waterborne diseases have spread; so
far hospitals have reported 175,000 serious diarrhea cases.
Diarrhea can lead to fatal dehydration.
	   The United Nations, appealing to the world to help Bangladesh
cope with the floods, noted this week that emergency shelters were
severely overcrowded.
	   ``This overcrowding combined with shortages of food, safe
drinking water and adequate safe sanitation facilities are the
almost perfect breeding ground for major disease outbreak and
public health crisis,'' the United Nations said in a statement.
	   The nearly 600,000 people living near the weakening earthen
embankment that protects the capital Dhaka and the nearby towns of
Narayanganj and Demra were warned Wednesday night to prepare for
evacuation. Soldiers, government workers and area residents plugged
more than 100 leaks and cracks with sandbags Wednesday.
	   Dhaka Deputy Commissioner Mobarak Ahmed said that 10 more
buildings _ all of them newly constructed but not yet occupied _
have been requisitioned by officials for use as emergency shelters
for women, children and the elderly in Dhaka and the two adjoining
towns.
	   A senior engineer at the Water Development Board, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity, said that if the embankment
collapsed, up to eight feet (2.4 meters) of water would cover the
area. But he said it would take at least eight hours to reach that
height, giving people time to evacuate.
	   Dhaka's Flood Forecasting and Warning Center said Thursday a
2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) stretch of the 35-kilometer (22-mile)
embankment had been further weakened by the overflowing of the
Buriganga and Sitalakhiya rivers.
	   The center said that both rivers were likely to swell further
under the impact of gushing waters from their upper reaches.
	   The flooding has destroyed an estimated 2.3 million tons of
rice.
	   The government has asked for dlrs 889 million in foreign aid and
has so far received pledges totaling dlrs 172 million. Government
officials have stressed that thanks to the response of the
international community, they do not fear a repeat of the famine
that killed 30,000 people following flooding in 1974.
	   Five ships with 100,000 tons of grain reached the southern port
city of Chittagong Wednesday. Port sources said the food was
purchased by the government and private sources before the flooding
struck when shortages were already predicted in this disaster-prone
country.
	   U.S. Embassy officials said Thursday that planes carrying
American aid _ automatic water purifying units, plastic sheets to
set up emergency shelters, and medicine _ were scheduled to reach
Dhaka within a few days.

Amsterdam exchange down sharply again Thursday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Prices on the Amsterdam Stock
Exchange opened down sharply again Thursday following declines on
Wall Street and the overall downward trend on European bourses.
	   At 0738 GMT, 8 minutes after the start of trading, the 27-share
AEX Index was at 1049.63 points, down 26.96 points, or 2.5 percent.
The AEX had closed down 1.7 percent at the final bell Wednesday.
	   Shares were being pushed lower mainly by the 1.9 percent drop of
the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday and the subsequent
decline on the European markets early Thursday.
	   Among the main losers Thursday was Anglo-Dutch consumer products
giant Unilever, down 5.1 percent. On Wednesday, Unilever said
Russia's economic crisis has sent its sales there plunging ``dozens
of percentage points'' in the past month.

Flooding swamps southern Mexico; death toll of 33 expected to rise

	   TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) _ Ripping walls from concrete houses,
smashing highways into pieces and dragging major bridges into their
depths, muddy torrents are raging across southern Mexico in
flooding that has shocked the entire nation by its intensity.
	   At least 33 people have drowned in the waters unleashed by seven
straight days of rain, and because dozens of towns are entirely cut
off by the water, it is impossible to know for sure how many more
may have been swept to their deaths.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo, who flew to Tapachula in Chiapas
state on Wednesday night, said dozens of people were missing and
predicted it would be days before rescuers could reach some towns.
	   ``The weather is furious, and the water is killing us,'' said
Juan Dominguez, a 76-year-old Tapachula resident who lost all his
belongings when the waters raged through his house.
	   He stood barefoot in a torn white T-shirt and mud-caked pants in
one of Tapachula's 15 emergency shelters. In his shelter alone,
about 600 people were waiting for food and water to arrive.
	   The flooding has driven at least 25,000 people in more than 50
towns and villages from their homes, according to Chiapas Gov.
Roberto Albores Guillen.
	   In many towns the situation was much worse than in Tapachula, a
city of 250,000 people 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the Guatemalan
border.
	   ``If the river keeps rising, it's going to reach the center of
town,'' Marco Antonio Santiso told Associated Press Television in
Huixtla, 20 miles (32 kilometers) to the west.
	   Police ordered an evacuation of Huixtla, but some residents
still huddled in their homes Wednesday, ignoring the orders even as
the swollen Huixtla River tore away and swallowed huge pieces of
riverbank and the brick walls of homes. Heavy rain continued to
fall.
	   One of the hardest-hit Chiapas towns was Pijijiapan, another 50
miles (80 kilometers) up the coast, where at least 18 people have
drowned.
	   ``People are dying because their houses suddenly were swept
up,'' Mayor Gilberto de los Santos said by telephone. ``There is no
way to bury the corpses. ... The river keeps rising and the rain
still keeps coming.''
	   Zedillo said 26 people had drowned by Wednesday night in
Chiapas. Another seven people died in flash flooding in other parts
of Mexico, which is being battered by a tropical storm in the
Pacific and a tropical depression in the Gulf of Mexico.
	   ``I think the important thing is for all Mexicans and our
brothers from Chiapas ... to know that we're here and that the
government will be working at full capacity,'' he told the Azteca
television network.
	   The president said the death toll could rise. More dead and
injured may be found as rescue workers, many of whom are blocked by
raging rivers and downed bridges, push into the most affected
areas, officials said.
	   ``The fact that 25 townships are cut off prevents us from
finding out what has happened to villagers there,'' Roberto Munoz
Lievano, Chiapas state interior secretary, said in a telephone
interview.
	   Guatemalan authorities evacuated 2,000 people from areas near
the Mexican border after rivers there overflowed their banks.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Police fired gunshots point-blank
into a crowd of protesters demanding the ouster of strongman Hun
Sen, critically wounding a student Thursday in the fourth day of
violent clashes.
	   After initially dispersing, the protesters regrouped and
regained momentum, dashing on motorcycles and on foot to different
parts of the capital, including the Angkor-style Independence
Monument. They were increasingly rowdy and undeterred by a monsoon
storm.
	   Human-rights workers unearthed two bodies from a shallow grave
near the airport. One was a 19-year-old man shot in the abdomen and
beaten until his skull was destroyed. The other was still being
exhumed.
	   They appeared to have been killed Wednesday. Human-rights
workers had said Wednesday that a Buddhist monk had been killed by
riot police, but an exhaustive search of hospitals and morgues
never produced a body.
	   Widespread belief that several monks praying at a demonstration
Wednesday were killed in a police assault with guns, clubs and
water cannon has escalated anger against Hun Sen stemming from his
disputed victory in parliamentary elections July 26.
	   Meanwhile, opposition legislator Khem Sokha was prevented from
leaving Cambodia when he tried to catch a flight. Hun Sen said
earlier this week that several opponents would be barred from
leaving. They have described themselves as hostages.
	   ``This is illegal,'' said Khem Sokha, who chairs the National
Assembly's human-rights committee. ``I am not a convicted person.''
	   The shooting occurred after several hundred people gathered
outside the U.S. Embassy and the residence of opposition leader
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, a focal point of unrest since a protest
camp was destroyed Tuesday.
	   Club-wielding riot police arrived, smashing a makeshift shrine
erected where monks were attacked by police Wednesday. Protesters
rebuilt it as soon as they left. The police returned to destroy it
again. A few rocks were thrown.
	   Five police opened fire with Kalashnikov rifles, two of them
firing straight into the crowd. A student, Tour Khunnaruth, 18, was
struck in the neck and rushed in an embassy car to a hospital,
where his mother said later his condition was critical. She
fainted.
	   The Association of Southeast Asian Nations urged both sides to
``exercise restraint, avoid violence, including extremists acts,
and resolve their problems through dialogue and consultations in
order to prevent further deterioration of the situation.''
	   ASEAN urged all sides to accept the elections, in which Hun Sen
won a parliamentary majority but lacks the two-thirds needed to
form a new government. The opposition alleges fraud and is
withholding support.
	   ASEAN, which postponed Cambodia's membership after Hun Sen
deposed Ranariddh in a coup last year, noted that the international
community had endorsed the vote as sufficiently free and fair.
	   The verdict was disputed on the streets.
	   ``They're trying to crush democracy by arms,'' said Sengta Damy,
26, a law student. ``We're very angry at the soldiers. We want an
end to dictatorship and corruption.''
	   The numbers of protesters swelled to more than 500 and they
appeared to be looking for a fight. Shops were closed.
	   ``Who is the dictator?'' chanting leaders shouted.
	   ``Hun Sen!'' the crowd replied.
	   ``Who is the murderer?''
	   ``Hun Sen!''
	   Weeks of peaceful protest turned violent when Hun Sen cracked
down Monday after grenades were thrown at his house. He blamed
opposition leader Sam Rainsy, who has called the attack a
``ridiculous pretext.''
	   Sam Rainsy has been threatened with arrest and is seeking refuge
at the local U.N. offices.
	   Lakhan Mehrotra, the U.N.'s chief official, met Ranariddh's
father, King Norodom Sihanouk, on Wednesday and returned with a
proposal for new talks including the U.N., electoral officials and
the major parties.
	   Ranariddh unilaterally made two concessions Wednesday, dropping
demands for a recount of ballots and revoting in some areas. But he
held firm to demands that the opposition be given more
parliamentary seats in reflection of their greater share of the
popular vote.
	   Ranariddh called for a massive peaceful rally Sunday. The
Interior Ministry quickly denied permission.

	   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) _ Jeff Cunningham scored the lone goal as
the Columbus Crew shut out the Miami Fusion 1-0 Wednesday in Major
League Soccer.
	   Cunningham's goal on a give-and-go with Crew forward Stern John
in the 49th minute led Columbus to its fifth straight win and
within three points of clinching second place in the MLS Eastern
Conference.
	   The Crew (15-12) can clinch homefield advantage for the first
round of the playoffs with a win Saturday at New England.
	   Columbus goalkeeper Juergen Sommer made six saves for his fourth
shutout of the season.
	   Cunningham, who entered the game in the second half as a
replacement for defender Ricardo Iribarren, beat Miami goalkeeper
Bill Andracki with a low shot to the left side.
	   Miami (13-16) played most of the game a man down because Fusion
defender Joey Martinez was ejected in the 33rd minute after a
tackle from behind on Columbus forward Robert Warzycha. Martinez
had drawn a yellow card earlier in the half for a hard foul.
	   Andracki, who finished with five saves, kept the Fusion from
going down 2-0 with a diving save on a shot off a rebound by John
in the 55th minute.

Sri Lankan cricket board can release Muralitharan only for two

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's cricket board can release
spin-bowler Muttiah Muralitharan for only about two months after
the World Cup to play for England's Lancashire county team, a top
official said.
	   After the World Cup in May-June, the Sri Lankan cricket team
will travel to Australia in late August to play three Tests and
take part in a four-nation one-day competition. Then Sri Lanka will
visit Zimbabawe to play three Tests and an equal number of one-day
internationals.
	   ``At best we can release him for two months after the World
Cup,'' Dammika Ranatunga, chief executive of the Board of Control
for Cricket, told The Associated Press Wednesday.
	   The comments came after news reports from Manchester, England
that Muralitharan has signed a one-year contract to play for
Lancashire.
	   Other Sri Lankan cricket officials said the Sri Lankan board is
yet to formally communicate its decision to release Muralitharan.
He is the leading bowler in international cricket with 68 wickets
this year.
	   ``My goal is to improve my bowling further and also to improve
my fielding, and I am sure playing in England will help in
attaining both,'' Muralitharanhe said when reached by the
telephone.
	   ``I want to polish my bowling to a level that I can achieve my
goal of getting 300 Test wickets,'' the 26-year-old said. He is the
first Sri Lankan and 24th in the cricket world to claim 200 Test
wickets; he has played 42 tests.
	   Old Trafford officials have been tracking Muralitharan since
current captain Wasim Akram announced he would be unavailable next
season due to his World Cup commitments for Pakistan.
	   Akram, who has played for Lancashire for 10 seasons, has since
decided to have another season in England, but will now have to
play for another county.

the crash was under investigation.

Mexico City police offered cash bonuses for arrests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAIGE BIERMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Cops who do their jobs right in Mexico City
can now count on a little something extra: 300 pesos (dlrs 30) for
each felony arrest.
	   As part of an innovative plan devised by the city's new police
chief, officers will get cash bonuses for catching bad guys _ but
will also be booted off the force if they're caught accepting
bribes for letting them go.
	   The cash bonus is part of a program aimed at fighting corruption
and renewing citizen confidence in the Mexico City police. Several
high-profile cases this year have shown police to be involved in
kidnappings, rapes and corruption.
	   Meanwhile, crime continues at unprecedented rates in this city
of 8.5 million residents, where in 1997 an average of 700 violent
crimes were reported daily. Analysts believe the real figure is
much higher.
	   Police Chief Alejandro Gertz Manero took over as Mexico City's
top cop late last month, replacing Rodolfo Debernardi who had
failed to live up to promises to reduce crime.
	   Both chiefs were appointed by Mexico City's leftist mayor
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the first opposition mayor in seven decades.
Cardenas is under great pressure to lower crime rates, especially
since he's often mentioned as a candidate for the 2000 presidency.
	   Much of that success may depend on the new anti-corruption and
officer-incentive policies.
	   ``The idea is to elevate police productivity and combat
corruption inside the force,'' said Ricardo Pascoe Pierce,
president of the Benito Juarez borough where the incentive program
began this week.
	   According to Pascoe _ and to many officers themselves _ patrol
officers are typically forced to pay their superiors a daily quota,
which in turn forces officers to extort money from suspects and
ordinary citizens. He said drastic measures are needed.
	   ``Our feeling is that it wouldn't work to just fire everyone and
start over with a new police force,'' said Pascoe, a member of
Cardenas' Democratic Revolution Party.
	   ``Past administrations have fired thousands and then we just end
up with thousands of armed, unemployed cops on the streets, many of
whom become criminals themselves.''
	   But many are skeptical that the incentive program can turn bad
cops around.
	   ``This could be dangerous because officers could just start
arresting anyone to earn the 300 pesos,'' said Mexico City
councilman Armando Salinas, a member of the center-right National
Action Party.
	   ``I'd also like to know where they plan to get the money to pay
all of those bonuses.'' He pointed out that officers who make one
arrest a day could triple their salaries, which average dlrs 350 a
month.
	   City officials, however, insisted the bonuses would be paid only
for arrests in which there's enough evidence to book the suspect.
	   The police department couldn't say where the money for the
bonuses would come from, but said no new funds would need to be
added to the budget.
	   Some officers were enthusiastic.
	   ``I guess I could pull in an extra 2,000 pesos (dlrs 200) a
month,'' said one officer, a 10-year veteran of the force who
declined to give his name for fear of punishment from a superior.
	   ``I could probably get more (than dlrs 30) from a crook,'' the
officer said, ``but I'd rather turn him in so he can't come back
later and accuse me of blackmailing him.''

South Korean chip makers protest anti-dumping ruling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Two South Korean computer chip makers
on Thursday protested a U.S. ruling that they have been selling
their products below cost, an illegal practice known as dumping.
	   LG Semicon and Hyundai Electronics Co. planned to dispute the
ruling in the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York,
accusing the U.S. Commerce Department of making ``serious errors''
in its pricing review.
	   ``We will not stand idly by while our reputation as a fair and
competitive supplier of DRAMs is impugned,'' a statement from LG
Semicon said.
	   On Wednesday, the U.S. Commerce Department imposed a 9.28
percent anti-dumping tariff on DRAM, or dynamic random access
memory, chips from LG Semicon and a 3.95 percent duty on products
from Hyundai Electronics.
	   It was the first time the two South Korean chip makers were
forced to pay a penalty on their shipments to the U.S. market.
South Korea's leading DRAM maker, Samsung, was not subject to the
penalty.
	   LG alleged errors in the U.S. calculations and said the U.S.
government falsely based its ruling on LG products ``unlawfully
diverted to the U.S. market by third parties.''
	   LG sells about dlrs 200 million worth of chips in the United
States annually. Hyundai's share of the U.S. market is worth about
dlrs 800 million.
	   Hyundai called the U.S. ruling ``unacceptable'' but said it
would not be seriously affected because 90 percent of the chips it
sells in the United States will come from its new dlrs 1.3 plant in
Eugene, Oregon.
	   The two Korean firms have been cited for alleged dumping each
year since 1993. Until this year, they had been cleared of the
charge each time.
	   The Commerce Department began its investigation after Micron
Technology Inc. of Boise, Idaho, and other U.S. chip makers alleged
dumping by their South Korean competitors.
	   In July 1997, the Seoul government filed a complaint with the
World Trade Organization, demanding that the United States stop its
annual investigation.
	   Computer memory chips are South Korea's key export item. The
country accounted for 34 percent of the world's dlrs 20.9 billion
DRAM market last year.
	   Micron and other U.S. chip makers have accused their South
Korean competitors of creating a global oversupply.
	   The price of DRAM chips _ which allow computers and other
electronic devices to store data for quick retrieval _ has dropped
80 percent in the past year, industry officials say.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Venus Williams, wearing the fifth of seven
outfits in her U.S. Open wardrobe, began her quarterfinal match
against Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario as if she had no intention of
showing off the last two.
	   In the first set, she won 18 points and made 18 unforced errors.
This, she decided, was a ratio that simply would not work against
the French Open champion.
	   So Williams shifted into overdrive and turned the match around,
winning 2-6, 6-1, 6-1 to move into the semifinals against Lindsay
Davenport.
	   It was, Williams said, simply a matter of making up her mind to
play better.
	   ``The first set, I was impatient, making a lot of errors,''
Williams said. ``Arantxa was out there to win and I just had to
want it more and stop missing.
	   ``I decided I was going to make my shots and do what I had to
do. The errors had to stop or I'd be heading home. There were no
other options available. I felt I had the capacity to do so.''
	   It was a complete reversal of form, with Williams taking charge
of the match in the last two sets. The turning point came at the
end of the second set when Williams lost five set points before
converting the sixth. She then broke Sanchez-Vicario to start the
third set and cruised to victory after that.
	   Williams made just 10 errors in the second set and seven in the
third, taking the match away.
	   Sanchez-Vicario was as surprised as anybody.
	   ``I think I played a very good first set,'' she said. ``I was
dominating her, moving her around. So I think I surprised her a
lot.
	   ``That way of playing, I'm not much used to it, to play like
that. I guess I probably got a little bit tired in the second set.
I continued to force, but I started missing.''
	   And Williams started connecting.
	   ``She played well. It's not like she played badly,'' Williams
said. ``I knew what to expect. I was ready.
	   ``You know when you go out there (against her) you're going have
to hit a plethora of balls,'' she said. ``You really have to make
sure you're patient and ready to go and just ready to stay out
there, no matter what happens.''
	   Next comes Davenport, who also relies on a power game and rode
it to a 6-0, 6-4 victory over Amanda Coetzer in the quarters.
	   Williams has a plan.
	   ``All I have to do is play well, make my shots and be interested
in winning,'' she said.
	   Interested?
	   ``Sometimes it's a problem because if you don't have the right
amount of interest, it can go badly,'' she explained.
	   ``I have to give my best. That's what I did (Wednesday night).
That's what I'll do in the semifinals. That's what I'll do the rest
of my career.''

World Wildlife Fund to help China protect golden monkeys
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The World Wildlife Fund will provide a dlrs 1
million grant to China to help protect the endangered golden
monkey, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported Thursday.
	   The survival of the rare species, found mainly in mountain
forests in southwestern Yunnan province, is threatened by logging _
the main source of income for minority groups in the area.
	   The World Wildlife Fund grant will finance tree planting and
construction of hydropower stations and new irrigation systems to
help raise farmers' crop yields and protect the monkeys' natural
habitat, the report said.
	   Only several thousand golden monkeys remain in the wild. Xinhua
said the five-year program also would fund research on the species'
behavior and numbers.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ World squash No. 1 Peter Nicol of
Scotland cruised through the first round of the Commonwealth games
tournament Thursday, winning in 13 minutes.
	   Nicol beat Guyana's Regan Pollard 9-0, 9-0, 9-1.
	   ``I moved well, conditions were great, they suit my game,''
Nicol said of his speedy win.
	   Prince Edward, a Commonwealth patron and keen squash player,
arrived in time to watch England's world No.5-ranked Simon Parke
advance with a 9-0, 9-0, 9-1 win over South African schoolboy James
Letlake.
	   Letlake has emerged from a development program launched in the
Soweto township in 1992 and is the first colored player to
represent his country at squash.
	   Canada's Jonathon Power, the world No.3 who beat Nicol last
month at the Hong Kong tournament, was also an easy winner, downing
Sri Lanka's Saman Thilekaratna 9-0, 9-1, 9-0.

Hingis seeking Grand Slam in doubles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Martina Hingis is looking for a Grand Slam with
a victory in the U.S. Open.
	   No, not singles, which she lost before the final at Wimbledon
and the French Open. But she won the doubles at the first three
Grand Slam tournaments this year and was in the doubles semifinals
Thursday with Wimbledon singles champion Jana Novotna, who faces
Hingis in the singles semifinals.
	   Although known more for her singles success, Hingis actually has
won more doubles titles than singles _ 20-19. She has won eight
titles this year with four different partners. In 1997, she won six
with five different partners.
	   This year Hingis won the Australian Open with Mirjana Lucic as a
wild-card entrant. Then, with Novotna as a partner, she won both
the French Open and Wimbledon.
	   In 1996 Hingis became the youngest person to win a Grand Slam
title when she captured the Wimbledon doubles with Helena Sukova at
15 years, 10 months.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; HOCKEY FANS: Wayne Gretzky and his wife, Janet, were in the
players' box cheering for Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario on Wednesday
night in weather more suited for hockey games than tennis matches.
	   Gretzky is a big tennis fan and participated in a charity event
for the Vitas Gerulaitis Youth Foundation. Gerulaitis, a former
tennis star who won the 1977 Australian Open, died after inhaling
fumes from a swimming pool heater while napping in 1994.
	   New York Ranger teammates Mike Richter and Brian Leetch were
also on hand during the day to support Gretzky.
	   Another hockey player-turned-tennis fan has already had his
tournament ended. Detroit Red Wing Sergei Fedorov followed the
matches of his friend Anna Kournikova, who lost to Sanchez-Vicario
in the fourth round.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ More than 1,000 troops and police
guarded the state palace Thursday to block some 700 student
protesters who demanded President B.J. Habibie lower soaring food
prices or quit.
	   It was the fourth straight day of bold student protest against
the embattled leader, struggling against Indonesia's worst economic
crisis in 30 years while trying to reform its autocratic political
system.
	   There were no reports of arrests or injuries.
	   Riot police with sticks and shields moved in as students
assembled in an adjacent park, the site of Indonesia's National
Monument, and marched toward the palace.
	   A roadway was blocked by army trucks as lines of security
personnel moved within a few meters (yards) of the students and
contained them on three sides after their numbers swelled.
	   Chanting demonstrators sat down on the pavement several hundred
meters from the palace itself. They peacefully dispersed after
about three hours.
	   Discontent with Habibie's crisis-bound presidency is growing.
	   On Monday, students marched on Parliament and tore down the
gates of the legislature.
	   Troops and police used sticks, shields and tear gas to evict
them from its grounds on Tuesday.
	   On Wednesday a visit by Habibie to Indonesia's second-largest
city, Surabaya, was marred when 4,000 students and opposition
supporters protested.
	   Thursday's demonstration was the first major protest outside the
palace complex since Habibie took office more than three months ago
and comes despite warnings from the powerful military which has
pledged its support for the president.
	   As many as 600 troops armed with rifles were stationed near the
white pillared colonial, Dutch-built palace, which is flanked by a
collection of buildings that house the offices of Habibie and other
senior government officials.
	   Habibie held a series of meetings inside the complex as the
protest went on.
	   The students, many wearing brightly colored jackets that are the
uniforms of their universities, demanded lower food prices and
called on Habibie's authoritarian predecessor President Suharto to
be put on trial for corruption.
	   They also demanded that the armed forces give up a
constitutionally sanctioned role in politics under which it is
represented in the Cabinet and the Parliament.
	   Unlike other student demonstrations this week, Thursday's
protesters stopped short of demanding that Habibie quit
immediately.
	   ``We are putting pressure on Habibie,'' said Indra Fatrimanto, a
protest organizer. ``He must stabilize prices. If he can't then he
must step down.''
	   ``People are hungry, lower prices,'' read one banner.
	   The demonstration was peaceful, although witnesses said police
stopped another 100 students from entering the park from a nearby
railroad station.
	   Habibie came to power in May after riots and student protests,
in which 1,200 people were killed, forced Suharto to resign after
32 years in power.
	   Although Habibie has said he has done much to attack corruption
and nepotism, there has been growing discontent as prices for food
and other essentials soar and unemployment climbs.
	   Officials fear that as many as half of Indonesia's 202 million
people could fall into poverty.
	   Reports of food shortages have been matched by looting and
crime.
	   Habibie has warned that unless checked, the crisis could
threaten national unity in the world's fourth most populous country
that consists of more than 300 ethnic groups on about 17,000
islands.
	   Habibie has said that he is doing his best to fix Indonesia's
problems, but his calls for patience have being ignored by students
and opponents.

	   ``I cannot harm Russia. Russia has had enough upheavals this
century. This is my choice,'' Chernomyrdin said.
	   Yeltsin made the decision to nominate Primakov after meeting
with him and Chernomyrdin at the Kremlin.
	   The Communist-dominated lower chamber of parliament, the State
Duma, had already indicated it would agree to Primakov as premier.
Yeltsin and the Duma have been locked in a bitter two-week battle
that stalled the formation of a new government after Chernomyrding
was rejected twice.
	   Primakov, 68, a former Soviet foreign policy expert, is seen as
a technocrat, not ideologically linked to any political faction. He
has been criticized in the West for taking a less liberal line on
foreign relations.
	   He was named foreign minister in January, 1996 and has been
praised by most of Russia's political factions for doing a good
job.

General accuses Suu Kyi of working with terrorists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ While Myanmar's military government
continued its arrests of the country's democracy activists, a top
general accused Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi of
working with terrorists, state-run newspapers reported Thursday.
	   Gen. Tin Oo, one of the top four generals in the 21-member
ruling military council, said Suu Kyi was working ``in
collaboration with underground terrorists and some super power
countries,'' the New Light of Myanmar reported.
	   Their goal, he said, was to cause instability and the
disintegration of the nation.
	   Tin Oo is army chief of staff and a leader of what is considered
the hard-line faction in the State Peace and Development Council,
the official name of the junta.
	   Suu Kyi and her party follow a doctrine of political change
through nonviolence. She has cited U.S. civil rights leader Martin
Luther King and Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi as her influences.
	   The military has arrested more than 500 members of Suu Kyi's
political party, the National League for Democracy, since May,
party leaders said Wednesday.
	   More than 300 of the arrests have taken place since Sunday. The
military began rounding up NLD members this week to prevent the
party from convening the parliament elected in 1990.
	   The NLD said 129 members of parliament were arrested in the
latest sweep. A total of 187 have been arrested since May.
	   In addition, the All Burma Students Democratic Front, an exiles
group, said the junta had arrested more than 300 students since
June for campaigning for democracy.
	   ``The ABSDF estimates that more than 900 political arrests have
taken place since May, including MPs from all opposition parties,
opposition party officials, students, Buddhist monks and other
political activists,'' the group said.
	   The military has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1962.
	   The United States, Britain, France, Germany, Japan and other
nations, along with human rights group such as Amnesty
International, have condemned the arrests and called on the
military to begin a dialogue with the NLD.
	   On Thursday, the Burma Lawyers Council, composed of exiles,
called on the country's lawyers to endorse the convening of
parliament.
	   The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in the parliament, but
despite promising to hand over power to the winners before the poll
took place, the military refused to honor the result.
	   The party set Aug. 21 as a deadline for the military to call the
assembly into session. When the generals refused, the NLD said it
would convene parliament, known as the People's Assembly, on its
own.
	   The military warned the NLD that such a move would be illegal
and could result in the party being outlawed. It claims it has
arrested no one, but merely ``invited'' NLD members to military
guest houses for an ``exchange of views.''
	   Suu Kyi, whose movements are severely restricted by the
government, has not been seen in pubic since the crackdown began.

Gambia's president flies to Libya in violation of U.N. sanctions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The president of Gambia has flown to Libya,
becoming the latest of several African presidents to violate the
U.N. air embargo against the North African country, Egypt's
official news agency reported Thursday.
	   Gambian President Yaya Jammeh arrived in the Libyan capital of
Tripoli on Wednesday and met Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, the
Middle East News Agency reported.
	   During his visit of several days, Jammeh will take part in the
extended celebrations of the 29th anniversary of the coup that
brought Gadhafi to power, MENA said.
	   Last Saturday _ the anniversary _ the presidents of Sudan, Chad,
Niger, Mali and the Central African Republic flew to Libya in
violation of U.N. Security Council sanctions that ban direct
flights to and from Libya.
	   The council imposed the embargo in 1992 in a bid to force Libya
to hand over for trail two suspects wanted for the 1988 bombing of
a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, that left 270 people
dead.
	   Libyan sources told MENA that Jammeh's flight was ``an
implementation of the last African summit resolutions.''
	   The Organization of African Unity decided at its June summit to
no longer abide by the sanctions when travel was required for
humanitarian activities or official business.
	   Until recently most statesmen and officials have respected the
embargo by flying to Tunisia and crossing overland into Libya.

Amsterdam exchange down sharply again Thursday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Prices on the Amsterdam Stock
Exchange opened down sharply again Thursday following declines on
Wall Street and the overall downward trend on European bourses.
	   At 0738 GMT, eight minutes after the start of trading, the
27-share AEX Index was at 1049.63 points, down 26.96 points, or 2.5
percent. The AEX had closed down 1.7 percent at the final bell
Wednesday.
	   Shares were being pushed lower mainly by the 1.9 percent drop in
the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday and the subsequent
decline on European markets early Thursday.
	   Among the main losers Thursday was Anglo-Dutch consumer products
giant Unilever, down 5.1 percent. On Wednesday, Unilever said
Russia's economic crisis has sent its sales there plunging ``dozens
of percentage points'' in the past month.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo share prices fell for the second consecutive
day Thursday, showing little reaction to a rate cut by Japan's
central bank. The U.S. dollar rose against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 89.51 points, or 0.61
percent, closing at 14,666.03. On Wednesday, the index had shed
157.95 points, or 1.07 percent.
	   ``Getting action on banking reform is much more important than a
small rate cut,'' said Keiko Kondo, a strategist at Merrill Lynch.
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the main opposition
parties remain deadlocked over bills to restructure the nation's
ailing banking system, now saddled with piles of bad debts.
	   Late Wednesday, the Bank of Japan announced a decision to lower
overnight call money rates _ the rates banks charge each other to
borrow money overnight without collateral _ to about 0.25 percent
from about 0.5 percent.
	   The measure is designed to prevent Japan's economy from falling
into a deflationary spiral.
	   But market players said that was not enough to offset worries
about Japan's banking system and the global financial turmoil.
	   Trading was modest, with an estimated 364 million shares
changing hands on the exchange's first section, down from
Wednesday's 417 million shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers 763
to 359, with 162 issues unchanged.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 6.10 points, or 0.55 percent, to 1,109.91.
The TOPIX lost 15 points, or 1.33 percent, the previous day.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 135.70 yen, up 2.30 yen
from late Wednesday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of
137 yen overnight. Trades ranged from 134.57 yen to 136.20 yen
during the day in Tokyo.
	   The dollar's retreat from its New York highs came as some
traders speculated that the U.S. Federal Reserve may also soon cut
interest rates.
	   Lower interest rates erode returns for investors and make the
country's currency less attractive.
	   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan indicated on Friday that the
financial turmoil in Asia and Russia may pose more of a threat to
the U.S. economy than inflation. Traders interpreted the statement
as an expression of willingness to cut interest rates.
	   Also affecting the dollar was uncertainty over the direction of
U.S. President Bill Clinton's sex scandal, traders said. Congress
will start reviewing evidence sent from Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr that could lead to impeachment proceedings.
	   The yield on the No. 182 10-year Japanese government bond
dropped to a record low of 0.840 percent from Wednesday's finish of
1.005 percent, driving its price up to 114.27 yen from 113.04 yen.
The previous record-low yield was 0.995 percent on Sept. 1.

Court says eyeglass company can make fun of tax man in ads
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UTRECHT, Netherlands (AP) _ The verdict is in: It's OK to make
fun of the tax man, even on national television.
	   The Dutch Tax Service took Pearle Vision Centers to court after
the eyeglass company lampooned the tax agency's TV spots and
modified its slogan in ads promoting a sale on glasses and contact
lenses.
	   But a court in this central Dutch city threw out the lawsuit
Wednesday, ruling that ``the law should leave room for a laugh.''
	   The tax service had argued that Pearle stole its six-year-old
slogan, ``We can't make it nicer, just easier.'' Pearle's TV spots
say, ``We can't make it nicer, just cheaper.''
	   The ads, which have amused many Dutch since they first began
airing late last month, feature a woman with the same hairstyle and
mannerisms as the announcer in the tax service's public service
spots.
	   Further exasperating the tax people, the Pearle spots even show
the dreaded blue envelopes the tax agency sends to every Dutch
household at tax time.
	   ``Pearle apparently thought: We can't make a nicer ad, so this
(copy) is really easy,'' said Mathijs Wallheimer, a lawyer for the
tax service.

Iraq reacts to U.N. suspension of sanctions review
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS more quotes from editorial. &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A leading Iraqi newspaper reacted Thursday
to the U.N. Security Council's decision to suspend periodic
sanctions reviews, saying the move was ``neither strange nor a
surprise.''
	   Iraqi media, which is closely controlled by the government,
seemed to be waiting for instructions Thursday morning on how to
respond to the suspension. National radio and television did not
even mention the Security Council's decision and government
spokesmen declined to comment.
	   The Security Council voted unanimously Wednesday to suspend the
reviews of the comprehensive trade sanctions that have crippled the
Iraqi economy. The sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
	   The resolution suspends a major, 6-month review scheduled for
October, and all subsequent 60-day reviews until Iraq resumes
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The council's move retaliated for Iraq's decision Aug. 5 to
withdraw its cooperation with U.N. inspectors seeking to check
whether Baghdad has destroyed its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The newspaper Babil, which is owned by the son of President
Saddam Hussein, was the only publication to react to the suspension
early Thursday.
	   Its editorial said the move was ``neither strange nor a surprise
because the understanding is that the sanctions will continue until
the United Nations, with the United States behind it, feel that
they are losing more than they are winning.''
	   The newspaper tried to link the sanctions to Israel, saying Iraq
was ``the spearhead against a (Middle East peace) settlement and
all the Zionist schemes to weaken any country which is outside this
political equation.
	   ``This proves that Zionism is the key to the sanctions on Iraq
(being lifted),'' the editorial added.
	   The council's stand hardens the lines between the world body and
the Iraqi government over the 8-year sanctions regime. Saddam
promised earlier this year to have the embargo lifted by early
1999.
	   But the council also gave Iraq an incentive to change its mind.
It agreed to conduct a ``comprehensive review'' of sanctions after
Iraq lets inspectors go back to work. Such a move could force the
council to acknowledge Iraq's progress in ridding itself of its
weapons of mass destruction while generating pressure for a lifting
of sanctions.
	   ``They have left the door open to us,'' Babil commented. In a
reference to Russian, French and Chinese efforts to ease the
sanctions, the editorial said the council needed ``some way to
release the pressure.''
	   ``They have said the sanctions will stay until Iraq agrees to
the return of the inspectors. This means they are taking us back to
the point of disagreement,'' the editorial continued.
	   ``We need an action and not a reaction.''
	   U.N. arms experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
capabilities before the council will lift sanctions.
	   Iraq withdrew cooperation with inspectors after the chief
inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify that Iraq had
destroyed its banned weapons. The inspections cannot take place
unless Iraqi escorts accompany inspectors.

Violence continues in Macau: Reports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Despite tightened security, gang-related
violence has continued to spread in Macau, including an apparent
arson Thursday at a travel agency, reports said.
	   A motorcycle was set ablaze in front of the travel agency, which
was the target of a failed bomb attack, TVB, or Television
Broadcast Ltd., reported.
	   Several people were evacuated from the building, but the fire
was quickly put out, TVB reported. There were no injuries, and
police were investigating the incident, it said.
	   The arson came only two days after a home-made bomb injured five
police officers and 10 journalists after they were lured to the
scene by a nearby blast.
	   Macau Police said it was a ``two-pronged'' attack by the
criminal underworld on police and journalists covering criminal
activities.
	   No arrests have been made, and Macau police have tightened
security in the tiny Portuguese enclave, 40 miles (70 kilometers)
west of Hong Kong.
	   The enclave famous for its gambling and tourism industries has
come to the spotlight after a spate of gangland-style shooting
deaths, arson and other attacks _ many targeting government
officials.
	   Police say they believe the recent series of violence is linked
to gang wars over gambling profits that have been shrinking because
of Asia's economic slump.
	   Three government officials, including a gambling inspector, have
been killed since March.

Yeltsin nominates Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov as premier
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; EDs: COMBINES urgent series, adds additional details, adds byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY RENFREW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin nominated Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov to become prime minister on Thursday in a bid to end a
bitter dispute with parliament that has stalled efforts to stem the
country's economic crisis.
	   Yeltsin nominated Primakov after acting premier Viktor
Chernomyrdin asked the president not to nominate him as prime
minister for a third time.
	   ``I cannot harm Russia. Russia has had enough upheavals this
century. This is my choice,'' Chernomyrdin said.
	   Yeltsin made the decision to nominate Primakov after meeting
with him and Chernomyrdin at the Kremlin.
	   The Communist-dominated lower chamber of parliament, the State
Duma, had already indicated it would agree to Primakov as premier.
Yeltsin and the Duma have been locked in a bitter two-week battle
that stalled the formation of a new government after Chernomyrdin
was rejected twice.
	   Primakov, 68, a former Soviet foreign policy expert, is seen as
a technocrat, not ideologically linked to any political faction. He
has been criticized in the West for taking a less liberal line on
foreign relations.
	   He was named foreign minister in January, 1996 and has been
praised by most of Russia's political factions for doing a good
job.
	   But while Primakov was expected to be approved, it was not clear
if he would be able to do much to fix the country's economic
crisis. Although seen as a competent administrator, his field of
expertise is foreign relations, not economic policy.
	   In December 1991 he was named head of the Russian Foreign
Intelligence Service after years of working in Soviet government
agencies and political think-tanks. Former Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev picked him as one of his closest aides during the reform
period of the 1980s.
	   In 1989-1990 he worked as a speaker of one of the houses of the
Soviet parliament.
	   In 1990 he became Gorbachev's special advisor for foreign policy
issues and in 1991 became widely known in the West for his efforts
to avert a Gulf War by direct negotiations with Saddam Hussein.
	   Unlike most of Gorbachev's allies, he managed to remain in the
government after the Soviet collapse and has worked closely with
Yeltsin in recent years.
	   Yeltsin had been urged by political leaders on all sides to
agree to a compromise candidate and not propose Chernomyrdin for
the third and final vote. Russia endured a frenzy of political
speculation during the past two days as Yeltsin considered his
options.
	   The political stalemate has exacerbated Russia's economic
collapse, reflected in rising prices and a spread of emergency
measures, such as price controls, in some regions of the country.
	   Surprisingly, however, the country's tattered currency, the
ruble, continued Thursday to bounce back. Rubles, which were
selling at about 20 to the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, rose in street
sales to as strong as 10 to the dollar, although rates varied
widely.
	   Foreign currency dealers said the improved rate suggested that
people had exhausted their ruble supply in panic buying and had
begun to exchange their dollar savings.
	   The lack of rubles sent the currency's value up _ and added a
new dimension to people's worries.
	   ``I've been trying in the last few days to buy more,'' said
25-year-old Dmitry, a police officer who wouldn't give his last
name. ``But I can't change my money at a bank because there aren't
any rubles.''
	   Meanwhile, some stores in Moscow were restocking shelves and
people seemed less worried about food shortages.
	   ``I'm buying but I haven't been in panic. We see people
hoarding, but we don't do it. There's no reason for it, you can't
buy for your entire life,'' said Tatyana Shishkova, 57, a retired
teacher.
	   The Duma had twice rejected Chernomyrdin. If it rejects
Yeltsin's nominee a third time, the president would be forced by
law to dissolve parliament and call new elections.
	   Chernomyrdin spent five years as prime minister before Yeltsin
fired him last March, and many Russians blame him for the country's
economic problems. Yeltsin brought him back as acting prime
minister last month after firing Sergei Kiriyenko.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov warned that the Duma would
begin immediate impeachment proceedings against Yeltsin if he had
nominated Chernomyrdin a third time. A vote to start impeachment
proceedings blocks Yeltsin from dissolving the Duma, although it
was not clear if the opposition has enough votes to get such a
motion passed.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Tang Ningshen, whose record-breaking effort at
the 1996 Atlanta Olympics won him a gold medal, has announced his
retirement, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported Thursday.
	   Tang won China its first weightlifting gold medal in 12 years
when he lifted 677 3/4 pounds in the 130-pound class in the snatch
and clean-and-jerk.
	   The lift broke the mark of 672 1/4 pounds set by Nikolay
Pechalov of Bulgaria in 1993.

Sleuths question lawmaker from party accused of plotting with
</HEADLINE>
rebel &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Detectives have questioned an
opposition lawmaker who met with Tamil guerrillas after President
Chandrika Kumaratunga accused her political rivals of conspiring
with the rebels to overthrow her government, officials said
Thursday.
	   Jayalath Jayawardene, who traveled to the rebel-held northern
jungles last week to meet guerrilla leaders, was questioned for an
hour at his home in the capital on Wednesday evening, a member of
his staff said.
	   Jayawardene, a member of the opposition United National Party
involved with war-related issues, was not charged with any crime.
	   Jaywardene's driver was arrested Tuesday for taking the lawmaker
to the rebel-held area without permission from the military.
	   ``It is a serious issue. We have ordered a full investigation to
get to the bottom of the matter,'' Justice Minister Lakshman Peiris
said at a briefing Thursday.
	   Jayawardene was not immediately available for comment.
	   The UNP has not given details of Jayawardene's talks with the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. But after the meeting UNP party
leader Ranil Wickremasinghe called on the government to hold
unconditional negotiations with the rebels.
	   The Tigers have said they are not averse to a political
settlement of their demand for an independent homeland for minority
Tamils in the north and east of the country. They accuse the
Sinhalese majority of discriminating against Tamils, and took up
arms 15 years ago.
	   In a speech to her supporters seen as a response to
Wickremasinghe's call for peace talks, President Kumaratunga
reportedly said she had evidence of ``an understanding between the
LTTE and the UNP to work together with the aim of toppling the
Peoples' Alliance government.'' She did not elaborate.
	   The president has repeatedly said she will only negotiate when
the rebels surrender their weapons. The guerrillas scuttled the
last talks in 1995 by staging surprise attacks on the military.
	   The military then launched a series of offensives and drove the
rebels into jungle towns, but attempts to crush them there have
stalled. The war has been stalemated in the last year.
	   More than 54,000 people have been killed since the war began in
1983.
	   Last month, Kumaratunga extended a state of emergency from areas
directly affected by the fighting to the remaining parts of the
island nation, saying the country faced a difficult security
situation. She also postponed provincial council elections, saying
that the government's war effort would be weakened by shifting
30,000 security men from the battlefront to election duty.
	   Emergency powers allow security forces to search and detain
suspects and investigate matters relating to national security.

Philippines officials hope stability will attract investors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Philippines remains an attractive place for
Japanese investors because the country has established a stable
political system, the Philippines foreign minister said Thursday.
	   Foreign Affairs Secretary Domingo Siazon told reporters in Tokyo
that the Philippines won't elect a new leader for nearly six years,
ensuring investors need not fear political turmoil.
	   He said that the country has transferred power peacefully three
times since the ``people's power'' revolution in 1986, showing that
democracy has taken root in the Philippines.
	   ``For investors, political stability is a main consideration,''
Siazon said.
	   Siazon compared the business environment in the Philippines
favorably to that of other Southeast Asian countries, many of which
are undergoing a period of political uncertainty.
	   ``In Southeast Asia today you are seeing a transformation not
only in the economic process, but in the political process,''
Siazon said.
	   But he said he was optimistic that the countries of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations would be able to resolve
their problems within three years, making the regional grouping
stronger than ever.
	   He said this also could lead to an ``ASEAN plus three'' that
would include Japan, China and Korea and ``would form one common
market, one community and hopefully one currency.''
	   Siazon also warned that an excessive depreciation of the yen
against the U.S. dollar could scare away Japanese investors in the
Philippines and hurt the country's exports to Japan.
	   ``It is estimated that at 120 yen to the dollar, the likelihood
of Japanese investors going to the Philippines is much higher than
when it's at 140 yen to the dollar,'' Siazon said.
	   Siazon is on a Philippine economic mission to Japan with Finance
Secretary Edgardo Espiritu, Trade and Industry Secretary Jose
Pardo, Central Bank Gov. Garbiel Singson and other senior
officials.
	   The Philippines is asking Japan to co-finance three loans under
negotiation from the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank.
	   The mission had meetings scheduled with Foreign Minister
Masahiko Komura, Trade Minister Kaoru Yosano, Finance Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa and officials of the Export-Import Bank of Japan
and the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Commonwealth Games officials were
forced to drastically alter the draw for the three-day rugby union
sevens competition Thursday following the withdrawal of two teams.
	   Gambia and Zimbabwe pulled out of rugby, changing the structure
from five pools of four teams to six pools of three.
	   The new draw features seedings all through the draw with top six
teams being Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, South Africa, England and
Western Samoa.
	   The tournament will still take place from Saturday to Monday.
	   The redraw takes the pressure off Australia, which was in Fiji's
pool for the initial draw.
	   Australia will now face the Cook Islands and the Cayman Islands
in the first stage, while world champions Fiji have drawn Wales and
Swaziland.
	   England, which is sending a team devoid of test players, has to
meet Tonga and Kenya, South Africa faces Papua New Guinea and
Trinidad and Tobago and New Zealand has an easy draw against Sri
Lanka and Malaysia.
	   The pools will be redrawn after the first round on Saturday with
the teams then ranked depending on first stage results. After a
second round-robin series the top eight teams will contest the
finals.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ At the end of one cul-de-sac in a posh
Kuala Lumpur suburb, the growing crowds chanting ``Reformasi!''
have become a national spectacle.
	   At first hundreds, now thousands have descended on the home of
ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim every night since his
dismissal last week, some to support his reform campaign _ many
just to witness the show.
	   ``I came to see the fiesta,'' said Cheng Poh Hand, a corporate
lawyer, seated beneath a blue-and-white striped tent top on a
leather couch, doubling as lawn furniture on Anwar's back porch.
	   Anwar was sacked as finance and deputy prime minister and
expelled from the ruling party on lurid allegations ranging from
sexual misconduct with men and women to treason.
	   Since then he has held nightly rallies, often preaching barefoot
atop a coffee table, asserting his innocence and outlining his
campaign for political reform.
	   Anwar's residence, a spacious, white-stucco duplex, has been
transformed into a political command post where he mingles with
supporters _ many equipped with instamatic cameras to pose with the
fallen leader _ and journalists, staked out round-the-clock,
listening for police sirens.
	   For days, Anwar has said he fears his imminent arrest. But Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Thursday that police would avoid
arresting Anwar to prevent international media from labeling
Malaysia as ``repressive.''
	   Unable to read about Anwar's speeches in the pro-government
local press, Malaysians, many of whom traveled to Kuala Lumpur from
other states in country, have converged on Anwar's home to hear his
story firsthand.
	   University students distribute photocopies of foreign news
articles downloaded from the Internet to the crowd mixed with
political supporters, middle-class businessmen and housewives
clutching their children's hands.
	   ``Most of them, they want to hear his speech, what he has to
say,'' said Azman Ali Mohamad, a financial consultant, gesturing at
the more than 6,000 people spilling into the upscale neighborhood
around Anwar's home during a recent speech. ``I came to see him,
his house _ and all this.''
	   Mercedes and motorbikes jammed the usually quiet streets,
prowling for parking spots. Unable to enter Anwar's tightly-packed
backyard, onlookers crouched on the high stucco walls surrounding
his home. Others, craning their necks to see, held tape recorders
or video cameras in Anwar's general direction.
	   Vendors outside hawked bottled water with a sign that read:
``Reformation Water'' and bootlegged cassettes and videotapes of
Anwar's fiery speeches from the past week. One vendor estimated he
had sold 5,000 cassettes in four days.
	   The Domino's Pizza around the corner extended business hours
from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m. to feed the massive flow of customers.
	   To secure a good seat, onlookers have taken to arriving several
hours early and making themselves at home on Anwar's living room
couches or on plastic chairs lining his torn-up lawn.
	   A cluster of men on a recent afternoon sat in the backyard
watching a professional wrestling match on a giant-screen TV set up
to view back videotapes of Anwar's speeches.

Ross, Netanyahu meet; U.S. weighing whether to start draft
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. envoy Dennis Ross held talks with Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday amid signs that the gaps on
the scope of an Israeli withdrawal in the West Bank were narrowing.
	   Ross will determine after his meeting with Netanyahu whether to
start drafting at least part of an agreement on a pullback, said a
U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Ross is accompanied by Jonathan Schwartz, a U.S. State
Department legal adviser who drafted the 1997 agreement on an
Israeli withdrawal from most of the West Bank town of Hebron.
	   The Haaretz daily said Ross hopes to get something on paper by
the weekend, but that some issues would have to be finalized at the
highest levels, perhaps at a summit later this month when
Netanyahu, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill
Clinton attend the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
	   On the table is a U.S. proposal for an Israeli withdrawal from
13 percent of the West Bank and detailed provisions for Palestinian
cooperation with Israel and the United States on security.
	   Israel initially rejected a 13 percent pullback, but then said
it would agree, provided that 3 percent of that area is declared a
nature reserve in which Israel retains security control and the
Palestinians are not be allowed to build.
	   The Palestinians have said they accepted temporary restrictions,
but wanted assurances that the area eventually come under full
Palestinian control.
	   Asked about the Palestinian demands, Netanyahu adviser David
Bar-Illan, said Thursday: ``We don't believe that would be an
obstacle. The main thing is that we would have security control and
the veto on construction which would prevent the building of
military installations.''
	   The most difficult issue facing Ross is Israel's demand to
renegotiate an agreement on security cooperation.
	   A blueprint for Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation and a
Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants was worked out by
Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. security officials last December, but
was rejected by Netanyahu as insufficient.
	   The Palestinians initially said they would not agree to changes,
but in recent days have softened their position.
	   The Yediot Ahronot daily said the Palestinians would consider
renegotiating the security understanding, provided that Israel
agreed to all elements of the U.S. peace initiative, including
proposals on how to determine the size of an additional withdrawal.
	   The Palestinians ``will not allow the fragmentation of the
American initiative,'' Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said
Wednesday evening, after Ross talked for three hours with Arafat.
	   Leaving the meeting with Arafat, Ross did not answer directly
when asked whether the Clinton administration was committed to all
points of the U.S. plan, first presented in January.
	   But Erekat said later the American envoy had pledged to deal
with issues ``in a comprehensive manner.''
	   Before the Ross-Arafat meeting, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright spoke with Arafat by telephone, stressing the importance
of settling remaining differences, U.S. State Department spokesman
James P. Rubin said in Washington.
	   In other developments Thursday:
	   _ A Palestinian woman hurt during clashes in a Jerusalem refugee
camp died of her wounds. The woman, 41-year-old Kamila Nather, was
walking in the street on Saturday when she was struck in the face
by a rubber-coated steel pellet fired by Israeli troops trying to
disperse Palestinian stone throwers.
	   _ Near the West Bank town of Hebron, Israeli army bulldozers
uprooted olive and fig trees on a 1.5 acre plot the Palestinian
owner said has been confiscated for security reasons. The plot is
adjacent to a road bypassing Hebron and leading to the Jewish
settlement of Kiryat Arba.

Thai private sector agrees to debt restructuring framework
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank and five
private sector associations on Thursday signed an agreement to make
it easier for Thai corporations to deal with their massive debts.
	   Guidelines already exist for restructuring debt under a recently
implemented bankruptcy law. But Thursday's framework is an attempt
to get companies to enter voluntarily into negotiations with their
creditors.
	   David Proctor, chairman of the Foreign Bank Association, said
the guidelines encouraged debtors to disclose full information to
creditors who, in turn, should ``stand still'' on demanding loan
repayments while companies try to restructure debt.
	   The government previously announced tax incentives to encourage
corporate participation, while creditors are anxious to lower
non-performing loans through the process.
	   Bank of Thailand Gov. Chatu Mongol Sonakul said at the signing
ceremony that the 19-point framework was a first step to getting
Thailand's debtors and creditors to come together to deal with
problem loans.
	   The governor, who is also chairman of the debt restructuring
advisory committee, said he hoped the initiative could clean up 65
percent of Thailand's corporate debt.
	   He declined, however, to give a figure for non-performing loans
in the system, which some analysts see peaking at 40 percent of all
lending next year.
	   The Foreign Bank Association's Proctor said the agreement should
focus on getting high-profile companies to restructure debt, as
this would have a trickle-down effect on the rest of the economy.
	   ``This would set a precedent and means a large sector of
companies with problem loans could get back on a viable footing,''
he said.
	   The five associations that signed the agreement with the central
bank were the Thai Bankers Association, Association of Finance
Companies, the Foreign Bank Association, the Board of Trade and the
Federation of Thai Industries.

Yeltsin nominates Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov as premier
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with opposition leaders welcoming Primakov nomination,
ADDS Yeltsin quote, new details throughout. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos Available &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Bowing to bitter opposition from parliament, Boris
Yeltsin nominated his former spy chief Thursday as prime minister
to head emergency efforts to stem the country's economic crisis.
	   Yeltsin nominated Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov to be prime
minister after his first choice, Viktor Chernomyrdin, asked not to
be nominated for a third time. Leaders on all side had warned of a
political explosion if Yeltsin had again nominated Chernomyrdin.
	   ``In view of the repeated rejection of (Chernomyrdin) ... I ask
the State Duma to confirm the appointment of Yevgeny Maximovich
Primakov as chairman of the government,'' Yeltsin said in a brief
letter.
	   Opposition and pro-government political leaders promptly
welcomed Primakov's nomination, predicting the lower chamber of
parliament, the state Duma, would approve him. Confirmation
hearings were set for the weekend.
	   ``I think he will get the Duma's support. Common sense has
prevailed in our state,'' said Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov,
who spearheaded the opposition to Chernomyrdin. Primakov is ``known
in the country and in the world and can carry out policies
defending the interests of the nation.''
	   Yeltsin announced the nomination after meeting in the Kremlin
with Primakov and Chernomyrdin. Chernomyrdin said he asked the
president not to nominate him after two crushing defeats in
parliament.
	   ``I cannot harm Russia. Russia has had enough upheavals this
century. This is my choice,'' Chernomyrdin said.
	   Yeltsin and the Duma have been locked in a bitter two-week
battle over the premier's post that stalled the formation of a new
government after Chernomyrdin was rejected twice by the Duma.
	   If the Duma rejects Primakov _ an unlikely scenario _ the
president would be forced by law to dissolve parliament and call
new elections.
	   Primakov, 68, a former Soviet foreign policy expert, is seen as
a technocrat, not ideologically linked to any political faction. He
has been criticized in the West for taking a less liberal line on
foreign relations, showing support for Iraq and other regimes at
odds with the West.
	   He was named foreign minister in January 1996 and has been
praised by most of Russia's political factions for doing a good
job.
	   But while Primakov was expected to be approved, it was not clear
if he would be able to do much to fix the country's economic
crisis. Although seen as a competent administrator, his field of
expertise is foreign relations, not economic policy.
	   Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev picked him as one of his
closest aides during the reform period of the 1980s.
	   In 1989-1990, Primakov worked as a speaker of one of the houses
of the Soviet parliament. In 1990 he became Gorbachev's special
advisor for foreign policy issues and in 1991 became widely known
in the West for his efforts to avert a Gulf War through direct
negotiations with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
	   In December 1991, Primakov was named head of the Russian Foreign
Intelligence Service after years of working in Soviet government
agencies and political think-tanks.
	   Unlike most of Gorbachev's allies, he managed to remain in the
government after the Soviet collapse and has worked closely with
Yeltsin in recent years.
	   Yeltsin had been urged by political leaders on all sides to
agree to a compromise candidate and not propose Chernomyrdin for
the third and final vote. Russia endured a frenzy of political
speculation during the past two days as Yeltsin considered his
options.
	   The political stalemate has exacerbated Russia's economic
collapse, reflected in rising prices and a spread of emergency
measures, such as price controls, in some regions of the country.
	   Surprisingly, however, the country's tattered currency, the
ruble, continued Thursday to bounce back. Rubles, which were
selling at about 20 to the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, rose in street
sales to as strong as 10 to the dollar, although rates varied
widely.
	   Foreign currency dealers said the improved rate suggested that
people had exhausted their ruble supply in panic buying and had
begun to exchange their dollar savings.
	   Chernomyrdin spent five years as prime minister before Yeltsin
fired him last March, and many Russians blame him for the country's
economic problems. Yeltsin brought him back as acting prime
minister last month after firing Sergei Kiriyenko.

Palestinian woman wounded by Israeli police dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Palestinian woman who was critically hurt by
Israeli police during clashes in a Jerusalem refugee camp has died
of her wounds, hospital officials said Thursday.
	   Kamila Nather, 41, was on her way to a clinic in the Shuafat
refugee camp on Saturday when she was struck in the face by a
rubber-coated steel pellet fired by Israeli police trying to
disperse Palestinian stone throwers in the area.
	   Jerusalem police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said the clashes
began when camp residents stoned an Israeli ambulance called to
Shuafat to pick up a man suffering from a heart attack.
	   A resident of the camp, Khaled Khaldi, said the heart attack
patient was already dead when the ambulance arrived and that
residents threw stones because the police tried to push their way
into the local clinic to remove the body.
	   Mrs. Nather was a widow and mother of four handicapped children.

	   Carlton Communications gave no details of the talks with Arsenal
or say whether the discussions involved the possible purchase of
the Premier League champions.
	   ``We have discussed with Arsenal Football Club a range of ways
in which our two companies could work together,'' a company
statement said. ``These discussions are at an early stage.''
	   The announcement came a day after the board of Manchester United
accepted a 623-million-pound (dlrs 1 billion) bid from BSkyB, the
highest amount ever paid for a sports franchise.
	   The Manchester United takeover, which still needs approval by
the club's shareholders and the government, sparked speculation of
the possibility of a series of takeovers of soccer teams by media
companies.

Sampras, Williams move into U.S. Open semifinals

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Pete Sampras is going for a record-tying 12th
Grand Slam tournament title. Venus Williams is seeking her first.
	   Both are right on target in the U.S. Open.
	   Sampras and Williams solved the swirling winds in Arthur Ashe
Stadium and stayed on course with surprisingly easy victories
Wednesday.
	   ``With the conditions, it wasn't fun to play,'' Sampras said.
``Wasn't the best of tennis. I got through it. That's the main
thing.''
	   The top-seeded Sampras set up a semifinal match against
defending champion Patrick Rafter with a 6-3, 7-5, 6-4 victory over
No. 9 Karol Kucera. Rafter advanced earlier in the day with a 6-2,
6-3, 7-5 win over No. 12 Jonas Bjorkman.
	   Williams needed three sets to get past Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario,
who added a hyphen to her last name and a third French Open title
this year. But after dropping the first set, Williams had no
problems winning 2-6, 6-1, 6-1 to complete the women's semifinal
pairings.
	   A finalist last year, Williams will meet No. 2 Lindsay Davenport
in Friday's semis. Davenport gained a berth by pounding No. 13
Amanda Coetzer 6-0, 6-4.
	   The other women's semifinal will pair 1997 winner and top seed
Martina Hingis against reigning Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna.
	   The men's quarterfinals were scheduled to be completed Thursday.
No. 10 Carlos Moya faced Magnus Larsson in a day match, while two
unseeded players, Sweden's Thomas Johansson and hard-serving Mark
Philippoussis of Australia, meet at night.
	   Sampras gained a measure of revenge against Kucera, who beat the
world's top player in the quarterfinals at this year's Australian
Open.
	   ``I always remember my losses,'' Sampras said. ``He picked me
apart down in Australia. I was probably a little bit more on my
toes tonight than I was in Australia.''
	   Sampras presented too many problems for Kucera. The top seed had
13 aces and had 48 winners, compared to 27 winners for the Slovak
who eliminated Andre Agassi a day earlier.
	   Two more victories, and Sampras will tie Roy Emerson with 12
Grand Slam tournament singles crowns. He would also match the five
U.S. Open titles won by Jimmy Connors.
	   ``I'm not going to say I'm going to win every major I play, but
I certainly come in here with a very pumped-up attitude,'' Sampras
said. ``Certainly this is what the year boils down to for me, the
majors.''
	   Rafter, who had 44 winners and only 14 unforced errors, was too
much for Bjorkman, who played in long sleeves on a chilly afternoon
made even colder by a 24 mph (38 kph) wind. Rafter used his
exceptional speed to control the match, running down Bjorkman's
passing shots and darting to the net for winning volleys.
	   Rafter said he was used to playing in the wind, which he said
was like those in Mount Isa, the Australian town where he grew up.
	   ``I've been brought up in the wind, whether it's winter or
summer it's very windy conditions,'' he said. ``I've played in that
since I'm 10 years old.''
	   Williams committed more than half of her unforced errors in the
opening set, which saw Sanchez-Vicario win five of the last six
games, losing only her serve in the fourth game.
	   She found the range after that, powering her groundstrokes deep
into the corners and taking the net at just the right times.
Whenever it appeared Sanchez-Vicario had the upper hand, Williams
would raise her game and win the important points.
	   ``In the first set I was missing a lot, I wasn't patient. I
stayed away from my game plan,'' Williams said. ``I just had to
stop missing. I just had to make up my mind that I wasn't going to
miss anymore.''
	   And she didn't.
	   Davenport also used her power to down Coetzer. Consistent, if
not spectacular, Davenport never lost her serve, despite struggling
with the wind.
	   ``It's tough. When you're with the wind, you can't hit the ball
too far or it flies long. On the other side, you have to hit the
ball hard,'' Davenport said. ``You never know what's going to
happen out there in the wind.''
	   There were two short rain delays during the Davenport-Coetzer
match.
	   ``The wind and the delays probably helped me a little bit. I was
definitely struggling with the way she was hitting the ball,''
Coetzer said. ``Often the wind is a little bit of an equalizer. And
the rain delays gave me a little bit of an opportunity to slow
things down, have a chance to speak to my coach.''
	   She needed more than a pep talk against Davenport.

Protesters march in rain after student shot, demand peace

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Thousands of protesters soaking from
monsoon rains marched and shouted for peace Thursday after riot
police fired point-blank into a crowd of demonstrators, critically
wounding a student.
	   The marchers, who built up strength from a few hundred to more
than 6,000 people as bystanders joined in, were applauded and
cheered from balconies and storefronts. They included hundreds of
saffron-robed Buddhist monks.
	   The unexpected frenzy of support reflected intensifying anger
against strongman Hun Sen since he launched a violent crackdown
Monday to crush weeks of calls for his ouster following his
disputed victory in parliamentary elections July 26.
	   Belief is widespread that several monks were killed Wednesday
when riot police attacked thousands of protesters in the streets
near the U.S. Embassy and home of opposition leader Prince Norodom
Ranariddh.
	   Human-rights workers unearthed two bodies from a shallow grave
near the airport Thursday. One was a 19-year-old man shot in the
abdomen and beaten until his skull was destroyed. The other was
still being exhumed. They appeared to have been killed Wednesday.
	   Human-rights workers had said Wednesday that a monk had been
killed by riot police, but an exhaustive search of hospitals and
morgues never produced a body. A motorcycle taxi driver was killed
by police gunfire Monday.
	   Earlier Thursday, hundreds of protesters, mostly motorcycle taxi
drivers and students, had gathered near the U.S. Embassy, a focal
point of unrest since riot police using clubs, guns, shock batons
and water cannon destroyed a protest camp Tuesday.
	   Police soon arrived and smashed a makeshift shrine honoring
monks shot Wednesday. As soon as the police left, the crowd rebuilt
it. The police returned and kicked it apart again. A few rocks were
thrown.
	   Five police opened fire with Kalashnikov rifles, two aiming into
the crowd. An 18-year-old student, Tour Khunnaruth, was struck in
the neck and critically wounded. He was rushed to a hospital. His
mother fainted while describing his injuries to The Associated
Press.
	   The protesters played cat-and-mouse with police for several
hours, then launched their march from the Angkor-style Independence
Monument as the skies opened with seasonal rains.
	   They marched past the National Assembly and the mounds of dirt
that remain from the protest camp, dubbed Democracy Square,
destroyed by Hun Sen's security forces Tuesday in a failed bid to
crush demands for an end to his 13 years in power.
	   Police stationed at Democracy Square fired a few warning shots
in the air but let the cortege pass. It picked up strength as it
passed the Royal Palace, followed a road along the Mekong River,
and veered into the city's main covered market.
	   They shouted: ``Peace! Peace!''
	   Earlier, opposition legislator Khem Sokha, chairman of the
National Assembly's human-rights committee, was prevented from
catching a plane. He is one of several opponents Hun Sen has barred
from leaving the country. They have described themselves as
hostages.
	   The Association of Southeast Asian Nations urged both sides to
``exercise restraint, avoid violence, including extremists acts''
and to respect the outcome of the elections.
	   Hun Sen won a parliamentary majority but lacks the two-thirds
needed to form a new government. The opposition alleges massive
electoral fraud and is withholding support.
	   ASEAN postponed Cambodia's membership after Hun Sen deposed
Ranariddh in a coup last year. The violence this week has been the
worst since then, undermining the new legitimacy Hun Sen was
seeking from the election.
	   ``They're trying to crush democracy by arms,'' said Sengta Damy,
26, a law student, outside the U.S. Embassy early Thursday. ``We're
very angry at the soldiers. We want an end to dictatorship and
corruption.''
	   Chanting protest leaders shouted: ``Who is the dictator?''
	   Came the reply: ``Hun Sen!''
	   ``Who is the murderer?''
	   ``Hun Sen!''
	   However enthusiastic, the crowds seemed to lack direction now
that Ranariddh's opposition ally, Sam Rainsy, a master at public
protest, is threatened with arrest and seeking refuge at local U.N.
offices.
	   Hun Sen accused Sam Rainsy of being behind a grenade attack
Monday against Hun Sen's house. Hun Sen was not home and no one was
hurt. Sam Rainsy has called the allegations a ``ridiculous
pretext.''

EU delegation arrives in Moscow for crisis talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Senior diplomats from Austria, Britain, and
Germany began consultations Thursday in Moscow as part of the
European Union's response to Russia's economic crisis.
	   The political directors from the ``troika'' were to meet with
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Avdeyev.
	   Russia hopes to work out agreements ``between Russia and the EU
toward support efforts to stop the crisis and continue the reform
strategy,'' the Interfax news agency reported, citing unidentified
sources in the Russian Foreign Ministry.
	   The meetings will prepare for a visit from the troika's foreign
ministers to discuss Russia's crisis in greater detail, Interfax
said.
	   The delegation's leader is the political director of the
Austrian foreign ministry, Peter Hohenfellner, since Austria holds
the rotating EU presidency.
	   European Union leaders have repeated they will not give
financial aid to Russia until it makes serious efforts at economic
reform.

Home run ball No. 62 finally comes to rest _ in Hall of Fame
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN KEKIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COOPERSTOWN, New York (AP) _ The baseball that Mark McGwire hit
for his 62nd home run finally landed right where he said it
belonged _ in the Hall of Fame.
	   ``I'm excited!'' 9-year-old Danny Rys said Wednesday as he stood
at the entrance to the Hall of Fame awaiting the arrival of the
celebrated baseball.
	   The more than 200 people who gathered near the entrance to the
Hall broke into a chorus of the song ``Take Me Out to the Ball
Game'' just before the ball arrived. Around 3:35 p.m., a state
police sport utility vehicle rolled down Main Street with the
precious cargo.
	   ``All right! 62! 62! 62!'' they shouted in unison as a big red
St. Louis Cardinals duffel bag full of baseball goodies was carried
inside.
	   The ball, which was autographed by McGwire and dated ``9-8-98,''
was significant.
	   ``It's probably one of the most important artifacts in the
history of the game,'' Hall of Fame president Don Marr said.
	   And it was only part of the haul.
	   Accompanying it were McGwire's brown, flamed-treated Rawlings
bat, with his signature just above the label; his hat, uniform,
size 13 cleats and batting gloves; the uniform his batboy son Matt
was wearing; and the official scorecard of the game kept by Jack
Buck, who noted the home run with a jubilant ``62!''
	   ``This is like Christmas,'' said Marr, who put on a pair of
white gloves to hold the bat aloft for cameras to record the
historic moment. ``We knew Mark McGwire was going to be generous,
but we didn't know it would be so spontaneous, in the heat of the
celebration.
	   ``It means a lot,'' Marr said. ``The artifacts are terribly
important in assisting us in telling the story.''
	   They all will be part of a new exhibit _ ``The March on Maris''
_ to be unveiled to the public at 11 a.m. Thursday, which would
have been Maris' 64th birthday. The display will remain in the
front lobby for at least one year, exhibits curator Ted Spencer
said.
	   Also part of the bonanza was the black Big Stick Rawlings bat
Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs was using when he hit his 57th home
run of the season. That drive broke Hack Wilson's Cubs record,
which had stood since 1930 as the NL record until McGwire and Sosa
came along.
	   The two bats were placed on a table alongside the Louisville
Slugger that Maris used in 1961 to hit No. 61, which broke Babe
Ruth's record of 60 set in 1927.
	   ``This is a particularly monumental day for the Hall of Fame,''
Marr said. ``This speaks volumes about baseball players. They're
our greatest supporters. Both players could not have been more
generous. Fortunately, the ball was retrieved and given to Mark. We
found that refreshing.''
	   A photo of the Babe giving his farewell address at Yankee
Stadium just before his death a half-century ago hung on a wall to
the left of Marr, making the moment that much more poignant.
	   ``Mark McGwire has said these artifacts belong here,'' said
Marr, who slept with them Tuesday night just to make sure. ``He's a
man of his word. It was a spontaneous reaction by McGwire in the
locker room. We didn't expect to be coming home with this.''
	   Marr and two of his colleagues at the Hall of Fame traveled to
St. Louis on Tuesday carrying the Maris bat. Marr said the idea was
to share the memory with McGwire, Sosa and the Maris family, also
in attendance at Busch Stadium.
	   ``They were really touched by the bat,'' Marr said. ``We told
Sammy it was the same size, weight and length. He really got
excited, ran out, and brought in the bat he hit No. 57 with.
	   ``Mark took Maris' bat, rubbed his chest with it, and said,
`Roger, you're with me today.'''
	   And he was.

Ukrainian police detain over 100 criminal suspects in Odessa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Police in the Black Sea port of Odessa
detained more than 100 alleged mafia figures who gathered to
discuss dividing up their turf, news reports said Thursday.
	   The alleged mafia leaders, protected by some 80 guards, were
just about to start their gathering in a suburban residence when
dozens of special police and security service troops broke in, the
daily Fakty said.
	   The participants were scheduled to conduct a ceremony elevating
some of their colleagues to a higher status in group's hierarchy,
the report said.
	   The police operation lasted a few minutes and the suspects,
shocked by the raid, offered no resistance, Fakty said.
	   The men arrived in Odessa from all over the former Soviet Union,
including Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova,
Azerbaijan, Armenia, many European countries as well as the United
States, the daily Segodnya said.
	   Odessa is considered a hotbed of organized criminal activity. It
has a large port and is the route for many goods going in and out
of Ukraine.
	   Ukraine's Security Service spokesman Oleksandr Skrypnyk said the
operation was among the largest of its kind conducted by Ukrainian
police.
	   The 109 arrests included more than 40 men suspected of being
regional mafia leaders.
	   However, many of those arrested will probably be released soon
because police may not have enough evidence to charge them,
Skrypnyk, the spokesman, was quoted as saying in Fakty.

Ross, Netanyahu meet; U.S. weighing whether to start draft of
</HEADLINE>
pullback agreement &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. envoy Dennis Ross met with Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday amid signs that the gaps on the
scope of an Israeli withdrawal in the West Bank were narrowing.
	   Ross will determine after his meeting with Netanyahu whether to
start drafting at least part of an agreement on a pullback, said a
U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Ross is accompanied by Jonathan Schwartz, a U.S. State
Department legal adviser who drafted the 1997 agreement on an
Israeli withdrawal from most of the West Bank town of Hebron.
	   The Haaretz daily said Ross hopes to get something on paper by
the weekend, but that some issues would have to be finalized at the
highest levels, perhaps at a summit later this month when
Netanyahu, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill
Clinton attend the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
	   On the table is a U.S. proposal for an Israeli withdrawal from
13 percent of the West Bank and detailed provisions for Palestinian
cooperation with Israel and the United States on security.
	   Israel initially rejected a 13 percent pullback, but then said
it would agree, provided that 3 percent of that area is declared a
nature reserve in which Israel retains security control and the
Palestinians are not to be allowed to build.
	   The Palestinians have said they accepted temporary restrictions,
but wanted assurances that the area eventually would come under
full Palestinian control.
	   Asked about the Palestinian demands, Netanyahu adviser David
Bar-Illan, said Thursday: ``We don't believe that would be an
obstacle. The main thing is that we would have security control and
the veto on construction which would prevent the building of
military installations.''
	   The most difficult issue facing Ross is Israel's demand to
renegotiate an agreement on security cooperation.
	   A blueprint for Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation and a
Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants was worked out by
Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. security officials last December, but
was rejected by Netanyahu as insufficient.
	   The Palestinians initially said they would not agree to changes,
but in recent days have softened their position.
	   The Yediot Ahronot daily said the Palestinians would consider
renegotiating the security understanding, provided that Israel
agreed to all elements of the U.S. peace initiative, including
proposals on how to determine the size of an additional withdrawal.
	   The Palestinians ``will not allow the fragmentation of the
American initiative,'' Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said
Wednesday evening, after Ross talked for three hours with Arafat.
	   Leaving the meeting with Arafat, Ross did not answer directly
when asked whether the Clinton administration was committed to all
points of the U.S. plan, first presented in January.
	   But Erekat said later the American envoy had pledged to deal
with issues ``in a comprehensive manner.''
	   Before the Ross-Arafat meeting, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright spoke with Arafat by telephone, stressing the importance
of settling remaining differences, U.S. State Department spokesman
James P. Rubin said in Washington.
	   In other developments Thursday:
	   _ A Palestinian woman hurt during clashes in a Jerusalem refugee
camp died of her wounds. The woman, 41-year-old Kamila Nather, was
walking in the street on Saturday when she was struck in the face
by a rubber-coated steel pellet fired by Israeli troops trying to
disperse Palestinian stone throwers.
	   _ Near the West Bank town of Hebron, Israeli army bulldozers
uprooted olive and fig trees on a 1.5-acre (0.6-hectare) plot the
Palestinian owner said has been confiscated for security reasons.
The plot is adjacent to a road bypassing Hebron and leading to the
Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.

Hackett misses relay bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ World 1500-meter champion Grant
Hackett missed a chance to make Australia's 4x200-meter freestyle
relay team for the Commonwealth Games at a time trial Thursday.
	   The relay team beat the United States to claim the world title
in January when Hackett was a member. With Michael Klim, Ian Thorpe
and Daniel Kowalski having secured places, Hackett and Olympic
1500-meter champion Kieren Perkins were attempting to beat a time
set by Matthew Dunn at the Commonwealth trials.
	   Dunn survived the cut as Hackett beat home Perkins but too slow
to make the team.
	   The Australian relay team is considered a chance to break the
world record in Saturday's race.

Shares end slightly lower on absence of market direction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong shares closed marginally lower
Thursday on listless trading, with cautious investors staying away
on the absence of any direction in the market.
	   The Hang Seng Index _ the market's key indicator of blue chips _
was down 55.49 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 7,849.96.
	   Analysts said news of Japan's interest rate cut did little to
stimulate the market, with many investors standing by the wayside,
waiting for outside clues on future market direction.
	   ``The market was very silent,'' said Josephine Hui of Celestial
Asia Securities Ltd. ``(But) the fundamentals of Hong Kong's
economy are still very bad.''
	   Trading volume was valued at 4.29 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs. 557 million), compared with 4.71 billion (U.S. dlrs 611
million) in the previous session.
	   The day's biggest losers were HSBC Holdings shedding 2.50 to
close at 155.50, Cheung Kong Holdings losing 0.60 to end at 34.00,
and China Light losing 0.70 to end at 35.70.
	   Gainers were few with Hang Seng Bank up 1.40 to close at 47.70,
Bank of East Asia up 0.25 to close at 10.45, and China Resources up
0.25 to close at 7.20.
	   Hong Kong's flag-carrier Cathay Pacific was down 0.07 to close
at 6.90.

Military says 60 Tamil rebels killed in last two weeks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ The military Thursday claimed to have
killed 60 Tamil Tiger rebels and destroyed more than a dozen rebel
bases in the last two weeks in the north and east, a defense
ministry spokesman said Thursday.
	   The military said 10 soldiers were killed in various battles.
	   ``We launched many operations during the past two weeks and
destroyed more than a dozen terrorist bases,'' Brigadier Sunil
Tennekoon, the military spokesman, told reporters at a weekly
briefing. He declined to give exact dates, but said the fighting
took place during the past two weeks.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the military claim. The
government bars reporters from the war theater.
	   The guerrillas have been fighting for an independent homeland
for minority Tamils since 1983. They accuse the majority Sinhalese
of widespread discrimination in education and jobs.

Polish lawmakers uphold ban on beer ads
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Reversing a previous vote, parliament's
lower chamber voted Thursday to keep a ban on beer advertising
despite arguments that breweries were getting around it by using
bottles of non-alcoholic beers in their ads.
	   The Sejm had approved a liberalization of the 5-year-old ban in
July. But the Senate, expressing concern about Poland's high rate
of alcohol consumption, rejected it and sent the bill back to the
lower house for another vote.
	   After two months of discussions, the Sejm voted 192-177 with 27
abstentions Thursday to accept the Senate's position to continue
the prohibition.
	   The debate over the beer ads had divided Poland's government
coalition.
	   The centrist Freedom Union party, the junior partner in the
Solidarity-led government coalition, had proposed the relaxation,
arguing the ban was hard to enforce.
	   Some breweries, for example, dodge the law by using bottles of
non-alcoholic beer in their ads. The non-alcoholic labels are
almost identical to the regular brews, and many of the
non-alcoholic brands are not available in stores.
	   But Solidarity supported the ban, saying that beer ads encourage
young people to drink more. Studies show 60 percent of customers in
pubs are below 19 years of age.

Prosecutors arrest four more in defense scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A former executive of a major Japanese electronics
maker and three other officials were arrested Thursday on charges
of breach of trust in a widening scandal ensnaring military
officials and contractors.
	   Arrested by Tokyo prosecutors was Tatsumi Nagatoshi, a former
executive at NEC Corp., who is suspected of arranging a contract
that overcharged the government for military equipment.
	   The three others arrested were Hiroshi Nagasawa, an NEC manager,
and Toyo Communication Equipment Co. executives Shuichi Isobe and
Kozo Honda, prosecutors said.
	   The arrests follow the arrest last Friday of Masuo Morodomi, a
former Defense Agency official overseeing defense contracts, on
charges of helping a supplier overcharge the government for
military equipment.
	   Prosecutors refused to give further details. But the defense
officials are suspected of going along with that deal in exchange
for private-sector jobs after retirement.
	   Kyodo News Agency reported that Nagatoshi met with Kenichi Ueno,
then deputy director of the procurement department at the Defense
Agency, shortly after the overcharging problem surfaced in February
1994.
	   Ueno was arrested last Thursday, along with three executives of
Toyo Communication Equipment Co., which is 38.96 percent owned by
NEC.
	   Toyo Communications had been ordered to repay 2.5 billion yen
(dlrs 18.2 million) to the government for having sold overpriced
equipment over a five-year period.
	   But it was forced to return only 874 million yen (dlrs 6.4
million). Ueno is suspected of helping reduce Toyo's reimbursement
to the government.
	   Nagatoshi, the executive arrested Thursday, became president of
Japan Aviation Electronic Industry, a firm 50.2 percent owned by
NEC, three years ago.
	   The maximum penalty for breach of trust upon conviction is five
years in prison.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. envoy Dennis Ross held talks with Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday amid signs that the gaps on

Philippines stocks plunge on peso, Wall Street fall
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with peso closing lower &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks fell sharply to a
new six-year low Thursday, pressured by overnight losses on Wall
Street and the weaker peso, dealers said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index dropped 57.26
points, or 4.9 percent, to 1,100.17, its lowest level since closing
at 1,099.685 on March 30, 1992.
	   The peso, meanwhile, closed lower against the U.S. dollar in
moderate trading, pressured by the weaker yen and uncertainty over
the impact of a cut in Japanese interest rates.
	   Traders said Wall Street's 155.76-point fall Wednesday triggered
a wave of selling in Manila stocks, with blue chips suffering the
brunt of the sell down.
	   Decliners outnumbered gainers 64 to 22, while 30 issues were
unchanged.
	   ``Investors are giving up on the stock market ... and are now
clinging to cash,'' said Ian Kane, trader for Anscor-Hagedorn
Securities Inc.
	   He said lobbying by some Philippine businessmen for currency
controls to quell volatility in the peso-dollar rate is unsettling
fund managers, spurring them to further reduce their holdings of
Philippine stocks.
	   However, the central bank has reiterated its opposition to any
form of foreign-exchange controls following Malaysia's curbs
implemented on Sept. 1.
	   Kane said the stock market has already largely discounted a
slide in the PSE Index to three-digit levels within a matter of
months.
	   The weaker peso also helped fuel the sell off. The dollar
averaged 43.935 pesos for the day, up from 43.538 pesos on
Wednesday.
	   The peso briefly fell through the psychologically important
level of 44 pesos per dollar in morning trading following the Bank
of Japan's decision late Wednesday to cut overnight interest rates.
	   It was last traded at 43.860 pesos after reaching an intraday
high of 44.030 pesos.

Mozambique, once Portuguese property, competes in Commonwealth
</HEADLINE>
Games &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Mozambique's colonial masters were
from Lisbon, not London, but it has sent a squad of athletes to the
Commonwealth Games all the same.
	   Whatever their fortunes in Kuala Lumpur, the Mozambicans see
sport as a chance to promote ties that could help their nation,
poor and bruised from a civil war that ended four years ago.
	   ``It's the best force,'' manager Daniel Firmino said.
	   Shrugging off the legacy of Portuguese rule, the battered
southern African nation joined more than 50 former British colonies
as a member of the Commonwealth in 1996. Mozambique was keen to
push trade with neighboring Commonwealth nations.
	   Membership entitled it to participate in the games in the
Malaysian capital. So while the English language prevails in the
shops and hallways at the ``village'' where athletes are lodged,
the lush tones of Portuguese beckon here and there.
	   ``We came here to get experience,'' said Humberto Mota, a
Mozambican lawyer who took time off to shepherd his team through
the games, which open Friday and end Sept. 21.
	   The Mozambicans may get more than that.
	   Their star is runner Maria Mutola, 25, a three-time world indoor
champion in the 800 meters who was a fearsome soccer player at
school. She now lives in the United States.
	   The squad includes two more runners, two boxers, two badminton
players and one swimmer.
	   In the late 1890s, the Portuguese offered to sell Mozambique to
Britain's empire builder, Cecil Rhodes. He turned it down.
	   Now Mozambique is surrounded by Commonwealth countries,
including South Africa, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Swaziland and Tanzania,
all of which have athletes at the games.
	   Trying to adapt, students in Mozambique begin to learn English
at an early age.
	   ``It's a Latin culture,'' Mota said. ``(But) English is the
language of the world.''
	   He gestured proudly at the Mozambican flag, a single speck of
black, green, red and yellow draped from a 16th-floor window.
Mirroring its country's location, it was surrounded by dozens of
other flags belonging to its Commonwealth brethren.

Human rights group appeals on behalf of beaten dissident
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELAINE KURTENBACH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Chinese dissident group appealed Thursday to
U.N. human rights chief Mary Robinson to intervene on behalf of a
dissident's wife who was detained and beaten by police for trying
to meet her.
	   In a separate protest Thursday, a group of 128 dissidents from
throughout China sent a letter to the government demanding Chu
Hailan be compensated for injuries she suffered when plainclothes
police forcefully prevented her from meeting Robinson, Human Rights
in China said.
	   ``Since President Clinton's visit to China, harassment of
political prisoners and their families has grown much worse. The
Chinese government has made absolutely no actual progress in
improving human rights,'' said the open letter sent to foreign news
media by the New York-based rights group.
	   Chu, wife of imprisoned dissident Liu Nianchun, was standing
quietly by the entrance to Beijing's Hilton Hotel Wednesday before
Robinson arrived to give a speech.
	   She was waiting to seek Robinson's help in gaining her ailing
husband's release from a labor camp when she was dragged away.
	   Chu later said police beat her severely on the head and stomach
and took her to a local police station, where she was held for
eight hours.
	   Asked about the incident, Robinson said she spoke to Assistant
Foreign Minister Wang Guangya and was assured she was released. ``I
know her concerns are very serious concerns,'' Robinson said.
	   Liu Nianchun, one of China's most prominent dissidents, has been
in detention for more than three years without trial. Chu has been
seeking a medical parole to treat high blood pressure, stomach
problems and other ailments.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao claimed Chu was blocking
the hotel's entrance and disturbing order.
	   ``When an important visit is going on, anything that may
interfere with or undermine the visit, security staff will adopt
measures to prevent it from happening,'' Zhu said Thursday at a
routine news briefing.
	   When asked about the beating, Zhu said Chu Hailan made the
allegation of mistreatment, ``and I do not know if it is right.''
	   In a separate letter addressed to Robinson, Human Rights in
China urged that she demand Beijing investigate the incident,
punish those responsible and compensate Chu.
	   It urged Robinson to seek a guarantee from the Chinese
government that it will improve treatment of political prisoners
and their families.
	   The U.N. human rights chief, who left Wednesday for a two-day
visit to Tibet, has the delicate task of pushing for improved
protection of rights without offending her hosts' sensitivities
over international criticism of China's human rights record.
	   Robinson's visit has drawn numerous pleas from dissidents to
promote tolerance and curb police powers. But Chinese officials
indicated they did not want her to meet with government critics.
	   While in Tibet, Robinson was to follow up on a report that
Tibetan prisoners were interrogated and beaten after a visit last
year by a U.N. team on arbitrary detention.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu disputed that report, but did not
elaborate. He said he had no information on Robinson's activities
in Tibet, which were not open to foreign press coverage.

	   Major economic powers and global lenders, including the
International Monetary Fund, cut off support to debt-laden Pakistan
as part of sanctions imposed after the nation tested six nuclear
devices in May in response to similar tests by its hostile neighbor
India. Economic sanctions were also imposed on India.
	   Pakistan, a country of 130 million people, is struggling with
dlrs 32 billion in foreign debt and a shortage of foreign currency.
It needs international loans and credits to meet its foreign debt
obligations. Top government officials have already said Pakistan
may have to stall foreign debt payments and restructure its massive
foreign debt.
	   On Wednesday, the South Asian nation signed a dlrs 1.5 billion
financing package with a consortium of Islamic and Middle Eastern
Banks. Pakistan was seeking additional funds from the IMF and World
Bank in the talks that open Friday in Islamabad.
	   ``We don't want to raise expectations about the outcome of our
talks with the IMF-World Bank team which is arriving here on
Friday,'' Ashfaque Hasan Khan, the finance ministry spokesman, told
The Associated Press.
	   Last week, Ahsan Mansur, the IMF's resident director in
Pakistan, said he was hopeful that Pakistan will get a bailout
package. Last month, the U.S. State Department said Washington
would not block IMF financing for Pakistan.
	   But Samina Ahmed, an independent defense analyst in Islamabad,
said Pakistan will not get special low interest financing, known as
soft loans, needed to meet September's foreign debt payments until
it agrees to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty on nuclear
weapons.
	   Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Wednesday abruptly left
Pakistan for London, officially to visit the ailing ruler of Abu
Dhabi, Sheik Zaid Bin Sultan. However, Pakistani news media
suggested that Sharif's real purpose could be talks on debt
restructuring or on signing the nuclear ban.
	   Parliament has also been summoned for a special session to begin
debate Friday on signing the treaty. The debate, expected to last
into next week, was widely seen in Pakistan as a government effort
to build public support for signing the nuclear treaty.
	   The United States and other major powers want a firm commitment
from Pakistan on the treaty before agreeing to a debt restructuring
package. Pakistan is due to pay more than dlrs 750 million in
foreign debt this month, while it has just dlrs 700 million in
foreign currency reserves.
	   Khan, of the finance ministry, said the IMF-World Bank team will
stay in Pakistan for two weeks to take stock of the economy and
develop a crisis plan to present to the IMF board at its October
meeting in Washington.
	   The IMF stopped the third phase of a dlrs 1.56 billion loan to
Pakistan as part of the international sanctions. Analysts say
Pakistan now needs to restructure its foreign debt and get new
financing to revive its battered economy.
	   ``Now the country is passing through difficult times and the
government has taken steps to minimize the impact of sanctions. We
have slashed our expenses, trying to reduce the trade gap,'' Khan
said.
	   The global banking team is likely to press the government to
broaden the tax base, increase revenues, cut spending, and
privatize and revamp state-run institutions.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Police and soldiers scattered
thousands of protesters who had marched and shouted for peace
Thursday after riot police fired point-blank into demonstrators,
critically wounding a student.
	   The marchers, who built up strength from a few hundred to more
than 6,000 people as bystanders joined in, were applauded and
cheered from balconies and storefronts. They included hundreds of
saffron-robed Buddhist monks.
	   Police left them largely unmolested for about two hours until
they massed at the Angkor-style Independence Monument, when about
150 elite Flying Tiger police arrived, joined by 150 police on
motorcycles and soldiers in trucks.
	   They circled the crowd, then started moving toward it. The
marchers scattered into a nearby park and toward the Mekong river.
No shots were initially fired and the police did not immediately
start using clubs.
	   The unexpected frenzy of public support for the marchers
reflected intensifying anger against strongman Hun Sen since he
launched a violent crackdown Monday to crush weeks of calls for his
ouster following his disputed victory in parliamentary elections
July 26.
	   Belief is widespread that several monks were killed Wednesday
when riot police attacked thousands of protesters in the streets
near the U.S. Embassy and home of opposition leader Prince Norodom
Ranariddh.
	   Human-rights workers unearthed two bodies from a shallow grave
near the airport Thursday. One was a 19-year-old man shot in the
abdomen and beaten until his skull was destroyed. The other was
still being exhumed. They appeared to have been killed Wednesday.
	   Human-rights workers had said Wednesday that a monk had been
killed by riot police, but an exhaustive search of hospitals and
morgues never produced a body. A motorcycle taxi driver was killed
by police gunfire Monday.
	   Earlier Thursday, hundreds of protesters, mostly motorcycle taxi
drivers and students, had gathered near the U.S. Embassy, a focal
point of unrest since riot police using clubs, guns, shock batons
and water cannon destroyed a protest camp Tuesday.
	   Police soon arrived and smashed a makeshift shrine honoring
monks shot Wednesday. As soon as the police left, the crowd rebuilt
it. The police returned and kicked it apart again. A few rocks were
thrown.
	   Five police opened fire with Kalashnikov rifles, two aiming into
the crowd. An 18-year-old student, Tour Khunnaruth, was struck in
the neck and critically wounded. He was rushed to a hospital. His
mother fainted while describing his injuries to The Associated
Press.
	   The protesters played cat-and-mouse with police for several
hours, then launched their march from the Independence Monument as
the skies opened with seasonal rains.
	   The weather cleared as they marched past the National Assembly
and the mounds of dirt that remain from the protest camp, dubbed
Democracy Square, destroyed by Hun Sen's security forces Tuesday in
a failed bid to crush demands for an end to his 13 years in power.
	   Police stationed at Democracy Square fired a few warning shots
in the air but let the cortege pass. It picked up strength as it
passed the Royal Palace, followed a road along the Mekong River,
and veered into the city's main covered market before heading back
to the monument.
	   They shouted: ``Peace! Peace!''
	   Earlier, opposition legislator Khem Sokha, chairman of the
National Assembly's human-rights committee, was prevented from
catching a plane. He is one of several opponents Hun Sen has barred
from leaving the country. They have described themselves as
hostages.
	   The Association of Southeast Asian Nations urged both sides to
``exercise restraint, avoid violence, including extremists acts''
and to respect the outcome of the elections.
	   Hun Sen won a parliamentary majority but lacks the two-thirds
needed to form a new government. The opposition alleges massive
electoral fraud and is withholding support.
	   ASEAN postponed Cambodia's membership after Hun Sen deposed
Ranariddh in a coup last year. The violence this week has been the
worst since then, undermining the new legitimacy Hun Sen was
seeking from the election.
	   ``They're trying to crush democracy by arms,'' said Sengta Damy,
26, a law student, outside the U.S. Embassy early Thursday. ``We're
very angry at the soldiers. We want an end to dictatorship and
corruption.''
	   However enthusiastic, the crowds seemed to lack direction now
that Ranariddh's opposition ally, Sam Rainsy, a master at public
protest, is threatened with arrest and seeking refuge at local U.N.
offices.
	   Hun Sen accused Sam Rainsy of being behind a grenade attack
Monday against Hun Sen's house. Hun Sen was not home and no one was
hurt. Sam Rainsy has called the allegations a ``ridiculous
pretext.''

Rugby sked redrawn, rain again affects cricket but squash star
</HEADLINE>
Nicol cruises through &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new material &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Organizers had to redraw the rugby
schedule and rain disrupted two more cricket matches as the first
Commonwealth Games to be staged in Asia continued its shaky start
Thursday.
	   With just two days to go before rugby makes its debut, Gambia
and Zimbabwe pulled out of the 7-a-side event, changing the
structure from five pools of four teams to six pools of three.
	   The redraw helped Australia, one of the favorites, avoid
7-a-side world titlist Fiji. The two were originally grouped
together but the Aussies now are in a different group as the seeded
team against two minnows, the Cook Islands and the Caymans and Fiji
has a tricky match against Wales.
	   Cricket also made its first appearance Wednesday when two of the
opening day games were washed out by thunderstorms that left
puddles on the field. The same looked a possibility Thursday when
powerhouse South Africa faced outsider Northern Ireland at the Club
Aman.
	   The Irish were struggling at 89 for five off 38.1 overs when the
rain sent the players off the field. While the players waited for
it to stop, the South Africans wondered if they would be left to
split the two points with a team they were strongly expected to
beat.
	   The players were off the field for almost three hours before
resuming and South Africa was given a revised target, reaching it
for the loss of six batsmen to win by four wickets.
	   It was even worse Wednesday for Pakistan and India, two more
test playing nations who had to share the points with their
opponents in washed out matches. Pakistan was in control of its
game against Scotland while India was in a well-balanced match
against Antigua, which had Richie Richardson and Curtly Ambrose on
the lineup.
	   In other cricket matches Thursday, New Zealand scored a
five-wicket over Kenya, which upset the West Indies at the last
World Cup, and Barbados beat Bangladesh by four wickets.
	   Redrawing of the rugby schedule and disruptions to the cricket
were hardly what organizers wanted to see.
	   With Malaysia caught up in the economic uncertainty affecting
Asian in general as well as a much-publicized political scandal
surrounding finance and deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim,
organizers wanted the Games to run smoothly.
	   At least some things went easier than expected.
	   Peter Nicol, the world's No. 1 squash player, needed only 13
minutes to win his first match Thursday, crushing Guyana's Regan
Pollard 9-0, 9-0, 9-1.
	   ``This was my quickest match for a long time,'' said the Scot
whose biggest rivals here, in the absence of Pakistan's Jansher
Khan who has decided not to compete, is Canada's Jonathan Power and
Australia's Rodney Eyles.
	   Power's victory over Sri Lanka's Saman Thilekaratna was just as
easy 9-0, 9-1, 9-0 while No. 3 seed Eyles scored an even more
one-sided victory, beating Amos Lwiza of Tanzania, without losing a
point in 23 minutes.
	   Some 5,000 athletes from 70 nations are competing here, easily a
record and well up on the 3,200 at the last games in Victoria,
Canada, in 1994.
	   The number of sports has been increased from 10 to 16 with men's
and women's field hockey, squash, tenpin bowling and women's
netball joining rugby and cricket as newcomers.
	   But the track action has been weakened by the absence of many
big stars, such as Olympic and world champion and 100-meter record
holder Donovan Bailey of Canada, his Namibian rival Frankie
Fredericks and maybe even Ato Boldon of Trinidad, who also isn't
certain to run.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Ousted deputy Anwar Ibrahim
appears safe from arrest _ at least until the hordes of foreign
press in town for the Commonwealth Games head home.
	   Anwar, who has been holed up for a week at his home in a Kuala
Lumpur suburb, is under police investigation in allegations ranging
from bisexual misconduct to treason.
	   Police have said he could be arrested at any time.
	   But Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad acknowledged Thursday that
the foreign press would jump all over his arrest and paint the
Southeast Asian country as ``repressive.''
	   Hundreds of journalists are in town to cover the sporting event
that kicks off Friday and runs through Sept. 21.
	   When told of Mahathir's comments, Anwar laughed and said,
``That's good news.''
	   Mahathir sacked Anwar last week from his posts of deputy prime
minister and finance minister, saying that he had conducted his own
investigation and determined that his handpicked successor was
immoral and unfit to lead.
	   Mahathir said the police were still investigating the charges
laid out in the book, entitled, ``50 Reasons Why Anwar Shouldn't be
PM.''
	   ``I'm quite sure when they have sufficient evidence, they will
charge him in court,'' he said.
	   Anwar has denied the charges, saying they were trumped up to sap
his growing challenge to Mahathir's 17-year rule. His virtual house
arrest has led his supporters to come to him.
	   Thousands of people gather at his home each night to listen to
hours of speeches on political reform and the injustice of being
tarred by the government without trial.
	   Mahathir Thursday waved aside the possibility of imminent
arrest, saying his former deputy was free to move about as he
pleases.
	   ``I can assure you that if he wants to go around walking alone
in any part of Malaysia, he can,'' Mahathir said.
	   ``If anybody gets hurt, then he'll get full publicity,
especially in the international press.''
	   The test may come Friday.
	   Anwar intends to travel to Kajang, about 30 kilometers (18
miles) south of the capital, Friday night to meet with an Islamic
scholar.
	   On Saturday, he plans to drive to his hometown in the
northwestern state of Penang to meet with supporters and launch his
national reform campaign.
	   ``It's totally urgent to get the message out,'' he told The
Associated Press. ``I'm going to meet my constituents in Penang.''

Media group confirms talks with Arsenal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with further background, details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ One day after Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB network
announced a dlrs 1 billion takeover bid for Manchester United,
another media group said Thursday it was negotiating with London
club Arsenal.
	   Carlton Communications gave no details of the talks with Arsenal
or say whether the discussions involved the possible purchase of
the Premier League champions.
	   ``We have discussed with Arsenal Football Club a range of ways
in which our two companies could work together,'' a company
statement said. ``These discussions are at an early stage.''
	   The announcement came a day after the board of Manchester United
accepted a 623-million-pound (dlrs 1 billion) bid from BSkyB, the
highest amount ever paid for a sports franchise.
	   The Manchester United takeover, which still needs approval by
the club's shareholders and government regulators, sparked
speculation of the possibility of a series of takeovers of soccer
teams by media companies.
	   Arsenal, which also won the prestigious FA Cup last season and
is coached by Frenchman Arsene Wenger, played a scoreless tie with
London rival Chelsea on Wednesday night.
	   Along with Manchester United and Liverpool, Arsenal is one of
the clubs which could take part in a proposed European Super League
starting in 2000.
	   The Gunners, who start their European Champions League campaign
next week against French side Lens, are listed on the Ofex stock
exchange, smaller and more informal than the principal London stock
market.
	   On Wednesday, the club was valued at 162.4 million pounds (dlrs
271 million). After the announcement of the talks with Carlton,
shares soared Thursday and the club was revalued at 176.4 million
pounds (dlrs 294.5 million).
	   There are 56,000 shares in Arsenal. The club is run by chairman
Peter Hill-Wood and vice chairman David Dein.
	   Carlton Communications owns the Carlton Television company in
London and the Midland's Central Television and Westcountry
Television.
	   The group is a major seller of advertising airtime on TV and
cinema, and a 50 percent partner with Granada Group in ON Digital,
the digital TV consortium.

Chinese traders to finance Philippine police helicopter patrols
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A group of Chinese-Filipino traders,
who have often been targeted by kidnappers, agreed Thursday to
provide money for police to fly helicopters to fight crimes and
monitor traffic.
	   National Police Director Roberto Lastimoso said the group of
Chinese-Filipino businessmen pledged to provide 100,000 pesos (dlrs
2,326) a month to buy gasoline for three police helicopters, which
often are grounded for lack of fuel.
	   The traders signed an agreement to provide the money for six
months, he said.
	   Lastimoso said a police assault team will ride in each
helicopter, which will patrol metropolitan Manila daily. If no
crimes are spotted, the helicopters will be asked to monitor
traffic during rush hour.
	   Despite on and off police campaigns, kidnappings, bank robberies
and other serious crimes remain rampant. Police are often
criticized for delayed responses to crimes, and for the involvement
of some officers in criminal gangs.

Trimble, Adams discuss Northern Ireland's new government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Another symbol of Northern
Ireland's polarized past was shattered Thursday as Protestant
leader David Trimble and Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams discussed in
detail the formation of a new compromise government.
	   ``I think we can do business,'' predicted Adams, who spoke
directly with Trimble for the first time Monday at the Stormont
Parliament Building in east Belfast.
	   Thursday's encounter at the same venue went into much more
detail and involved far fewer officials _ including just the two
old adversaries breaking the ice alone for about 45 minutes.
	   Trimble, who in July was elected ``first minister'' of Northern
Ireland's envisioned cross-community government, had long refused
to speak to Adams' IRA-allied party unless the Irish Republican
Army started disarming.
	   That remained his key concern during the two men's discussion,
his aides said.
	   Trimble's Ulster Unionist Party is the chief representative of
Northern Ireland's British Protestant majority. The IRA began
bombing and shooting in 1970 in hopes of abolishing Northern
Ireland, but called a truce last year to permit Sinn Fein's entry
into multi-party negotiations that reached agreement in April.
	   After the two men met Thursday, Adams said their the encounter
was ``only the beginning.''
	   ``Obviously, I have to listen more to David Trimble, and he has
to listen more to me,'' he said. ``We have to try and have not just
an understanding of each other's positions, but also to see how we
can marry those positions.''
	   On Monday, Trimble and Seamus Mallon, a moderate Catholic and
``deputy first minister,'' met all the party leaders who supported
the peace agreement.
	   Trimble's first words to Adams on that occasion reportedly were
``Excuse me'' _ as he encountered his nemesis in a doorway.
	   Thursday's session began with Trimble and Mallon jointly meeting
Adams and four other Sinn Fein members. But in a gesture heavily
hyped by Sinn Fein and heatedly downplayed by Trimble's aides, the
two leaders went into another room to talk confidentially.
	   Trimble entered a side door of Stormont Parliament Building _
the old headquarters of a Protestant-dominated administration
closed down by the British government in 1972 _ without speaking to
reporters.
	   After Sinn Fein, Trimble and Mallon were jointly meeting four
other party delegations Thursday: Trimble's own Ulster Unionists;
Mallon's Social Democratic and Labor Party, Sinn Fein's larger
rival for Catholic votes; Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists, who
condemn Trimble for considering compromise with Sinn Fein; and the
Progressive Unionists, who represent a pro-British paramilitary
group, the outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force.
	   Each party had representatives elected in June to Northern
Ireland's new 108-member legislative Assembly, which will convene
Monday.

Twin giant pandas born in China's Sichuan province
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Giant panda Cheng Cheng gave birth to twin cubs
Thursday at a breeding research center in southwestern Sichuan
province, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   The twins, weighing 140 grams (4.9 ounces) and 58 grams (2.03
ounces), were conceived through artificial insemination at the
Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding Base, the report said.
	   It was the fourth time 13-year-old Cheng Cheng had given birth
and both mother and cubs were ``in good shape,'' it said. Often,
when pandas give birth to twins, only one survives.
	   So far, five pandas have been born this year at the research
center, the report said.
	   The giant panda is native only to China, with only about 1,000
surviving in the wild. The shrinking of their habitat and poaching
have devastated the species, spurring efforts to develop artificial
breeding techniques.
	   Those efforts have been frustrated by the reproductive habits of
pandas, which often have trouble conceiving and rearing healthy
cubs in captivity.

Guerrillas blast United States, Kosovo's moderate Albanian leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with KLA criticism of Washington, Rugova; trims.
Changes byline
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Separatists fighting for Kosovo's
independence blasted the United States and the province's moderate
Albanian leader on Thursday, saying their support of a deal with
Serbia will destroy the guerrilla struggle.
	   The statement by the political wing of the Kosovo Liberation
Army expressed fury at the marginalization of the guerrilla
movement by foreign powers.
	   The United States and its allies support both moderate leader
Ibrahim Rugova and a deal to end the conflict that falls far short
of KLA demands for full independence from Serbia.
	   The drive to find a solution to six months of fighting that has
left hundreds dead and upward of 265,000 homeless received fresh
impetus on Wednesday with news of a new exodus of tens of thousands
of ethnic Albanians from villages under fire in southwestern
Kosovo.
	   The victims fled villages in an area about 30 kilometers (18
miles) south of Pec, Kosovo's second-largest city on tractors and
wagons, clogging a dirt road in a column 12 kilometers (seven
miles) long, according to Western observers.
	   One official said the situation threatens to create as many as
25 new ghost towns in Kosovo, where scores of villages already have
emptied by shelling or clashes between ethnic Albanian rebels and
an alliance of Serbian police and the Yugoslav army.
	   Kosovo is a province in southern Serbia, the dominant of two
republics left in the Yugoslav Federation. Its population is 90
percent ethnic Albanian, most of whom back the rebels' armed
struggle for independence after decades of repression by Serbian
authorities.
	   ``They're panicking and going everywhere, but they don't know
which way to go,'' said Fernando del Mundo, a spokesman for the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, who heard shelling and saw
billows of smoke in the area Wednesday.
	   Foreign governments and aid organizations fear the worst if
urgent help isn't provided for the 50,000 or so refugees now living
in the hills and forests and facing starvation or freezing this
winter.
	   Western officials have held out the threat of military
intervention for months if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
doesn't halt the offensive. But such plans have been stymied by the
failure to reach an international consensus and by the difficulties
of mounting an effective military action in the mountainous region.
	   Most foreign efforts have focused on supporting Ibrahim Rugova,
the moderate Kosovo Albanian leader, and guiding him and Milosevic
to agreement on ending the conflict.
	   After months of shuttle diplomacy by U.S. envoy Christopher
Hill, the men recently announced tentative agreement on a draft
deal that would stop fighting and restore some of the autonomy
Kosovo enjoyed until 1989, when Milosevic abolished it.
	   But this is rejected by the KLA, which wants full independence.
The statement, issued by the KLA's political wing in Switzerland
and published by the daily Koha Ditore, said the interim deal is
``aimed at demobilizing the masses who have joined the liberation
war ... (and) destruction of the KLA.''
	   Heavily outgunned, the guerrillas have been on the run for much
of the past six months.
	   ``The talks going on between Rugova and the occupiers, arranged
by the U.S. ... present a cover for the Serb occupiers' terror over
the civilian population,'' said the statement.

Vietnam names new army chief of staff
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam has named a new army chief of
staff more than three months after the previous one died in a plane
crash in neighboring Laos, the newspaper Youth reported Thursday.
	   Lt. Gen. Le Van Dung was appointed to the post by President Tran
Duc Luong last Tuesday, the paper reported.
	   The appointment makes Dung, the former deputy chief of the
army's Political Affairs Department, the second highest ranking
military official behind the defense minister.
	   Dung is also a member of the powerful Communist Party Central
Committee.
	   He replaces Lt. Gen. Dao Trong Lich, who was killed along with
13 other senior Vietnamese army officers when the Russian-built
YAK-40 plane crashed in the northern Laotian province of
Xiengkhoung on May 25.
	   Lich, who also served as deputy defense minister, was heading a
high-ranking delegation from the Vietnam People's Army on an
official visit to Laos at the time of the crash.
	   Twelve Laotian officers, including a deputy chief of staff, were
also killed.
	   Vietnam's army is one of the biggest in the world, even though
at 500,000 troops it is about half the size it was a decade ago.

Swiss court blocks transfer of money linked to ex-Ethiopian
</HEADLINE>
minister &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's supreme court said
Thursday it has suspended legal aid to Ethiopia in the case of a
former minister accused of abuse of power and corruption.
	   The court also blocked the return of dlrs 8 million in Swiss
banks belonging to former Ethiopian deputy prime minister Tamrat
Layne.
	   The Federal Tribunal was ruling on an appeal by two people close
to Tamrat, who were not identified. It ordered that the money
remain frozen and imposed a series of conditions for its return.
	   In April, the Swiss Office of Police Affairs ordered that the
money and relevant bank documents be handed over to Ethiopian
authorities. It argued that ``the criminal origin of these funds is
clearly established.''
	   The office in December froze the money in a Geneva bank
following a request for legal aid from the Ethiopian government in
the case of Tamrat.
	   Tamrat, who was also Ethiopian defense chief, was fired in
October 1996 for involvement in high-level corruption. Since then
the Ethiopian government has been trying to get at his money.
	   The Swiss court called on Ethiopia to file a new legal aid
request with information on plans for the return of the funds.
	   Expressing reservations about the observance of human rights in
Ethiopia, the court said it would have to provide guarantees that
Swiss official representatives could visit those imprisoned in the
case without hindrance.

Supporters fast in protest of jailed opposition leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Human rights activists and
political supporters began an 18-day fast Thursday to vent their
``outrage'' at the jailing of an opposition lawmaker on sedition
charges.
	   Lim Guan Eng, deputy secretary-general of the Democratic Action
Party and a member of Parliament for 12 years, was sentenced by
Malaysia's highest court last month to 18-months jail for
criticizing the judiciary.
	   ``To express their dismay, shock, grief and outrage at the
injustice of the Lim Guan Eng case,'' three supporters at a time
will fast for 36 hours for a span of 18 days, said Lim Kit Siang,
the opposition leader in Parliament and the father of Lim Guan Eng.
	   The first three to begin the fast Thursday were Ahmad Nor, the
DAP vice chairman; Fan Yew Teng, a social activist and DAP member;
and Irene Fernandez, the nation's leading immigrants' right
activist.
	   Fernandez is on trial on charges of accusing guards of torturing
illegal aliens at detention camps.
	   The Federal Court overturned Lim's second appeal last month,
upholding an 18-month jail sentence on charges of sedition and
printing false news.
	   Lim had distributed a pamphlet in 1995 that criticized the
attorney general and the government for not pressing statutory rape
charges against a top government official.
	   It also queried why the underage girl involved was detained for
more than two years, but not the politician.
	   Amnesty International and Malaysia's Bar Council have criticized
the case, predicting it will further stifle free speech.
	   Lim's sentence makes him Malaysia's first sitting member of
Parliament to be sent to prison.
	   His case has been overshadowed by the sacking last week of
deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, under investigation on charges
of sexual misconduct and leaking state secrets.
	   Earlier this week, supporters appealed to King Tuanku Ja'afar,
with a petition signed by nearly 204,000 people asking him to
overturn Lim's sentencing. Malaysia's king has the power to
override the judiciary.
	   ``Gaun Eng in prison should be a daily reminder to Malaysians of
the need for greater public consciousness and activism to help
bring about justice, freedom, democracy and good governance for all
Malaysians,'' Lim Kit Siang said in a statement Thursday.
	   Lim, in the third week of his prison term, has been sleeping on
a cement floor in solitary confinement in a cell that has a light
on 24-hours a day, according to the statement.

Dutch pilots gripe about strict rules and regs in U.S. military
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Being confined to camp and
constantly having to salute your superiors is one thing.
	   But obligatory booze-free evenings and a steady diet of American
country and western music go way beyond the call of duty, the
laid-back Dutch pilots stationed with U.S. troops in Bosnia are
complaining.
	   A Dutch Defense Ministry magazine this month reveals the clash
of military cultures as easygoing Dutch troops share a base with
their ultra-disciplined U.S. brothers in arms.
	   In an article about living with the U.S. 6th Air Cavalry
Regiment at its Commanche Base in the northeastern Bosnian city of
Tuzla, Royal Dutch Air Force helicopter pilots praised the
professionalism of the Americans, who lead the NATO force charged
with preserving the peace.
	   But the Dutchmen griped bitterly about having to salute their
U.S. superiors, go without beer and endure ``obligatory country and
western evenings.''
	   Bemoaning their loss of creature comforts, the seven-man Dutch
contingent also grumbled about having to bunk down in ``tents that
look like they come from the TV show MASH'' _ and about being
roused at 6 a.m. for an hour of ``highly competitive'' physical
training.
	   The liberal Dutch armed forces are famous the world over for
their acceptance of long hair, earrings, 40-hour work weeks and gay
soldiers.
	   They're also allowed to drink two beers a night after 8 p.m.
Camp Commanche is dry.
	   The U.S. military ``doesn't appear to understand a happy
medium,'' Capt. Elmar Hermans, an Apache helicopter pilot, was
quoted as saying.

Keiko, the movie star whale, comes home

<TEXT>
	   HEIMAEY, Iceland (AP) _ In a Hollywood-style finish, ``Free
Willy'' star Keiko returned home to the waters of Iceland after 16
years in captivity and a career as movie star.
	   An Air Force cargo plane with the world's most famous killer
whale in a holding tank, landed on this windswept archipelago
shortly before 1000 GMT after an eight-hour flight from Oregon.
	   Keiko's handlers hope his return to Iceland will lead to his
transformation from an aquarium performing animal and movie star to
an animal of the wild again.
	   The plane appeared to land normally at Heimaey's airport, but
apparently blew some tires, which could alter the off-loading
plans.
	   ``They blew a few tires. I don't know the status the plane,''
said Gisli Signvgeirsson, a spokesman for the city.
	   A large flatbed truck bearing a ``Welcome Home Willie'' banner
waited to carry his container across town to the waterfront. He
will be loaded onto a barge and taken to a free pen in a protected
cove.
	   In his new sea pen, Keiko will be reintroduced to the sights and
sounds of the waters where he was captured as a 2-year-old. He will
live in his football-field sized bay pen off the rugged Westmann
Islands until his handlers determine he is able to live on his own
in the wild.
	   Keiko began his latest step toward freedom on Wednesday when he
swam into a holding tank, shimmied into a nylon stretcher and
calmly chirped as he was hoisted out of his home at the Oregon
Coast Aquarium.
	   ``He isn't putting up any kind of fight or hesitation in the
least,'' Free Willy Keiko Foundation vice president Bob Ratliffe
said after the whale was loaded onto an Air Force C-17 transport
plane. ``We're doing the right thing.''
	   Bidding the whale goodbye was tough for the children who fell in
love with Keiko from watching his movies and seeing him in his
spacious pool over the past 2{ years.
	   Hundreds of people, some with signs reading ``Keiko, we love
you'' and ``We will miss you,'' lined the highway as a truck
carried the whale on a slow, three-mile procession to the airport.
	   Keiko's bid for freedom has its roots in Hollywood and the hopes
of children around the world.
	   In the 1993 box-office hit ``Free Willy,'' about an orca
threatened by a villainous amusement park owner, the whale played
by Keiko leaps over a breakwall to freedom in the open ocean.
	   Real life, it seemed, wasn't so tidy. It was learned that Keiko
was languishing and deteriorating in a cramped Mexico City tank and
had no prospects of getting out.
	   School kids collected pennies to help save Keiko. Warner Bros.
and cell-phone billionaire Craig McCaw kicked in millions more to
bring the whale to the Oregon tank to recuperate from lung
infections and warty lesions, all with the aim of one day setting
him free.
	   Two and a half years and dlrs 12 million later, Keiko has
regained his strength, put on at least a ton of muscle and blubber
and has taken lessons to catch _ instead of being hand-fed _ his
daily diet of 145 pounds of fish.
	   Still, trying to transform a long-captive whale back into a wild
predator has never been tried before, and whale handlers at
aquariums across the nation have slammed Keiko's move as only a
feel-good exercise that puts the whale at risk.
	   Critics say that Keiko isn't skilled enough at catching fish,
has no experience interacting with other orcas and could be shocked
by the frigid, harsh conditions of the North Atlantic.
	   Even Keiko's most enthusiastic handlers say it will be at least
two years before they can determine if he can survive in the open
ocean. And they concede he may have spend the rest of his life _ 10
years or more _ in the pen.

Woman on 100-most dangerous list arrested in Naples
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAPLES, Italy (AP) _ Police here Thursday arrested a woman who
was among the 100 most dangerous suspected mobsters in the Naples
area, Italian news reports said.
	   Assunta Cecere, 35, considered by investigators to be a top
leader of the Sarno crime family in the Camorra syndicate, was
captured as she went to visit relatives, the ANSA and AGI agencies
reported.
	   For decades women played almost no major roles in Italy's
organized crime but in the last several years have been carving out
a place for themselves. One reason cited for the change has been a
state crackdown which has put thousands of male mobsters behind
bars.
	   Cecere was suspected of being an international drug trafficker,
AGI said. Her former longtime companion last year started
collaborating with investigators, leading to the arrest of the man
suspected of being the Sarno clan's top boss, Ciro Sarno, reports
said.

Gunmen in Philippines kidnap Taiwanese businessman's family

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Unidentified gunmen kidnapped the
family of a Taiwanese businessman in the southern Philippines,
where suspected Muslim rebels abducted an Italian missionary a day
earlier, police said Thursday.
	   Regional police commander Dominador Domingo said the kidnapping
was discovered late Wednesday after businessman Sammy Yang reported
his family missing.
	   Police, quoting witnesses, said the men seized Yang's
80-year-old mother, wife, 3-year-old daughter, and maid outside
their home in the village of Guiwan in Zamboanga City.
	   The kidnappers escaped with the victims in a van, which they
abandoned about 1.5 kilometers (1 mile) away, Domingo said.
	   Yang is the manager and part-owner of a resort and a food
manufacturing company in Zamboanga City, about 880 kilometers (550
miles) south of Manila.
	   No group immediately claimed responsibility for the kidnapping,
but police intelligence sources said they suspect members of a
Muslim extremist group, Abu Sayyaf, because the abduction was
carried out in the same way as the kidnapping of a German fish
cannery executive last year.
	   The German, Robert Buehs, was held for 108 days on the island of
Sacol off Zamboanga City until he was released after his family
paid ransom.
	   On Tuesday, suspected Muslim rebels kidnapped an Italian priest,
Luciano Benedetti, 54, of Ravenna, Italy, and 12 Filipinos in
Sibuco in Zamboanga del Norte province, about 50 kilometers (30
miles) northwest of Zamboanga City.
	   The Filipinos were later abandoned unharmed in a mountainous
area and rescued by police special forces, Domingo said.
	   Southern Philippine military commander Lt. Gen. Angelo Reyes
said officials had identified the abductors, and police and
military teams were preparing to try to rescue Benedetti in some
suspected hideouts.
	   Local officials also have been asked to prepare to negotiate
with the abductors, officials said.
	   Italian Embassy spokesman Andreas Ferarese said the embassy
would not pay if the kidnappers demand ransom.
	   Benedetti, who was assigned to the Philippines in 1977, belongs
to a missionary group called the Pontifical Institute for Foreign
Missions and is one of about 70 Italian priests assigned to the
southern region of Mindanao.
	   The kidnappings occurred amid a high-profile campaign against
crime by President Joseph Estrada. Kidnappings, bank robberies and
other crimes remain rampant despite on and off anti-crime drives.

 &UR; Students protest in East Timor for rebel leader's release

 &UR; With BC-Indonesia-Protest

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of students held a peaceful
demonstration outside East Timor's provincial Parliament Thursday
and demanded freedom for a jailed guerrilla leader.
	   Dozens of recently freed political prisoners joined in the
protest in Dili, the capital of the former Portuguese colony that
Indonesia invaded in 1975.
	   The demonstrators demanded the release of more political
prisoners including Xanana Gusmao, a separatist leader who was
arrested in 1992 and is serving a 20-year term in Jakarta's
Cipinang penitentiary.
	   The protest took place hours before the opening of a two-day
conference of rival East Timorese factions who either want or
oppose independence from Indonesia.
	   Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo, East Timor's spiritual leader
and 1996 Nobel Peace Prize winner, called on the 50 delegates to
put old rivalries and conflicts aside.
	   ``We came to this meeting to find reconciliation. Then we can
try to find a solution for our homeland's problem through peaceful
ways, negotiation, open dialogues and responsibility,'' Belo said.
	   East Timor, about 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) east of
Jakarta, has endured years of social unrest, guerrilla warfare and
human rights abuses since Indonesia annexed the territory in 1976.
	   The United Nations does not recognize the annexation but is
sponsoring negotiations between Indonesia and Portugal with the aim
of securing a peaceful future for East Timor.
	   President B.J. Habibie, who replaced former autocratic President
Suharto in May, has released dozens of political prisoners in East
Timor and other parts of Indonesia.
	   He has also offered to release Gusmao and grant some autonomy to
East Timor in return for international recognition that the
territory is part of Indonesia.
	   Meanwhile, 31 political prisoners being held in Becora jail are
continuing an 11-day hunger strike in support of demands for
Gusmao's release.
	   Activists said seven have been given medical treatment.

China urges Cambodian parties to negotiate peace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China expressed concern Thursday over the
violence besetting Cambodia and urged political parties to end
their standoff.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao deplored the worsening
tensions in Cambodia this week, saying ``We oppose any violent or
terrorist acts.''
	   China ``hopes that all political parties will fully respect the
wishes of the people and take as their priority the interest of the
nation,'' Zhu said. He suggested that the various parties submit to
negotiations under King Norodom Sihanouk.
	   Although once a staunch opponent of Hun Sen, China began tilting
toward the powerful Cambodian leader after he ousted Sihanouk's son
in a coup last year.

Anti-Aircraft fire on Israeli planes over Beirut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes broke the sound barrier
over the Lebanese capital on Thursday, drawing anti-aircraft fire
from gun batteries.
	   The supersonic booms over Beirut came amid heightened tension in
southern Lebanon where two Israeli-backed militiamen were killed
and five others wounded in a roadside bombing Wednesday.
	   It was not clear why the Israeli jets flew north to Beirut,
provoking anti-aircraft fire from guns on the hills above the city.
	   Witnesses said they saw no sign of the planes being hit.
	   Israeli planes attacked suspected guerrilla targets Wednesday in
southern Lebanon.
	   Guerrilla groups such as the Iranian-backed Hezbollah are trying
to oust 1,500 Israeli troops and the 2,500 militiamen from a border
zone that Israel has occupied since 1985 in a bid to prevent
attacks on its northern settlements.

Trimble, Adams discuss Northern Ireland's new government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Trimble comment, police announcement on army
patrols &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Another symbol of Northern
Ireland's polarized past was shattered Thursday as Protestant
leader David Trimble and Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams discussed in
detail the formation of a new compromise government.
	   ``I think we can do business,'' predicted Adams, who spoke
directly with Trimble for the first time Monday at the Stormont
Parliament Building in east Belfast.
	   Thursday's encounter at the same venue went into much more
detail and involved far fewer officials _ including just the two
old adversaries breaking the ice alone for about 45 minutes.
	   Trimble, who in July was elected ``first minister'' of Northern
Ireland's envisioned cross-community government, had long refused
to speak to Adams' IRA-allied party unless the Irish Republican
Army started disarming.
	   ``The question is when, when will we start to see progress on
that front?'' Trimble said after the meeting, which he called
``encouraging'' and ``civilized.''
	   At a separate press conference minutes earlier, Adams said their
encounter was ``only the beginning.''
	   ``Obviously, I have to listen more to David Trimble, and he has
to listen more to me,'' Adams said. ``We have to try and have not
just an understanding of each other's positions, but also to see
how we can marry those positions.''
	   Also Thursday, Northern Ireland's police chief announced that
British army patrols in support of his forces would be withdrawn
this weekend in Belfast. Soldiers, who had been used only sparingly
in recent weeks, would remain deployed in the city's many fortified
barracks as a precaution.
	   Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan said the decision was ``made
possible by the fact that we are continuing to have a significantly
reduced terrorist threat.''
	   However, soldiers would continue to patrol in force along
Northern Ireland's border with the Irish Republic, where the threat
of IRA ambushes has long forced British forces to travel by
helicopter rather than the roads.
	   Trimble's Ulster Unionist Party is the chief representative of
Northern Ireland's British Protestant majority. The IRA began
bombing and shooting in 1970 in hopes of abolishing Northern
Ireland, but called a truce last year to permit Sinn Fein's entry
into multi-party negotiations that reached agreement in April.

Most Asian markets lower on Wall Street losses, weaker yen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing prices of Asian markets; RECASTS and
TRIMS &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A weakening Japanese yen, overnight losses on
Wall Street and worries over Japan's ailing financial system
dragged Asian markets lower Thursday.
	   News of the Bank of Japan's interest rate cut _ a move usually
welcomed by markets because it cuts borrowing costs for companies _
failed to boost regional bourses.
	   ``I think the situation (in Asia) is tense because there is a
bit of volatility in the yen,'' said Andrew Fernow of Vickers
Ballas in Hong Kong. ``People are still contemplating the
sociopolitical problems across the regions, primarily in Malaysia
and Indonesia,''
	   The 1.9 percent drop overnight in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average in New York also added selling pressure, Fernow said.
	   In Tokyo, the Nikkei average of 225 selected issues fell for the
second straight day to end 89.51 points, or 0.6 percent, lower at
14,666.03.
	   Late Wednesday, the BOJ decided it will lower overnight call
money rates _ the rates banks charge each other to borrow money
overnight without collateral _ to around 0.25 percent from 0.5
percent.
	   Selling continued however amid persistent worries over the bad
loans burdening Japan's banks and the recent turbulence in global
financial markets.
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the opposition remain
deadlocked over legislation to restructure the banking system.
	   ``Getting action on banking reform is much more important than a
small rate cut,'' said Keiko Kondo of Merrill Lynch in Tokyo.
	   Analysts said the minuscule cut indicated Japan wasn't ready to
take more drastic steps to save its bleeding economy, and that hurt
regional market sentiment.
	   Investors also feared the rate cut and the ensuing fall in the
yen early Thursday would bring more instability to the already
battered regional currencies.
	   Late Thursday, the U.S. dollar bought 135.70 yen, up 2.30 yen
from late Wednesday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of
137 yen overnight. Trades ranged from 134.57 yen to 136.20 yen
during the day in Tokyo.
	   ELSEWHERE:
	   BANGKOK: Thai shares ended higher with the market benchmark
surging four points in the last minute of trade on an unexplained
purchase of Thai International Airways stock. The SET index gained
4.93 points, or 2.3 percent, to end at 218.91.
	   HONG KONG: Shares closed marginally lower on listless trading,
with cautious investors staying away on the absence of any
direction in the market. The Hang Seng Index was down 55.49 points,
or 0.7 percent, to close at 7,849.96.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed marginally higher despite fears
about the domestic political situation, as buying in cement shares
pushed up the index. The JSX Composite Index was up 1.509 points,
or 0.4 percent, to close at 327.271.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Shares finished broadly lower with local investors
cashing in on recent gains and foreigners staying away on worries
regarding separate settlement accounts. The Composite Index was
down 9.45 points, or 2.43 percent, to close at 380.20 points.
	   MANILA: The Philippine share index fell to a fresh six-year low,
pressured by overnight losses on Wall Street and the weaker peso.
The PSE Index ended down 57.26 points, or 4.9 percent, to close at
1,100.17, its lowest level since 1,109.93 on April 1, 1992.
	   SINGAPORE: Shares closed mostly lower as investors locked in
profits after three days of strong gains. The Straits Times Index
was down 20.46 points, or 2.3 percent, to end at 865.00.
	   SYDNEY: Share prices ended broadly weaker after negative
sentiment from lower overseas markets affected the sentiment in the
local market. The All Ordinaries Index was down 16.2 points, or 0.6
percent, to close at 2,526.3.
	   TAIPEI: Shares ended lower on Wednesday's losses in the U.S.
stock markets and profit-taking mostly in electronics and financial
shares. The Weighted Price Index was down 90.74 points, or 1.3
percent, to close at 6,803.83.
	   WELLINGTON: Shares closed lower on the absence of domestic
buyers and a credit rating outlook downgrade by Standard and
Poor's. The NZSE-40 was down 32.29, or 1.8 percent, to close at
1,760.76.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Separatists fighting for Kosovo's
independence criticized the United States and the province's
moderate ethnic Albanian leader on Thursday, saying their support
of a deal with Serbia will destroy the guerrilla struggle.
	   The statement by the political wing of the Kosovo Liberation
Army expressed anger at the marginalization of the guerrilla
movement by foreign powers.
	   The United States and its allies support both moderate leader
Ibrahim Rugova and a deal to end the conflict that falls far short
of KLA demands for full independence from Serbia.
	   ``The talks going on between Rugova and the occupiers, arranged
by the U.S. ... present a cover for the Serb occupiers' terror over
the civilian population,'' said the statement, issued by the KLA's
political wing in Switzerland and published by the daily Koha
Ditore.
	   The drive to find a solution to six months of fighting that has
left hundreds dead and upward of 265,000 homeless received fresh
impetus on Wednesday with news of a new exodus of tens of thousands
of ethnic Albanians from villages under fire in southwestern
Kosovo.
	   The Albanians fled villages in an area about 30 kilometers (18
miles) south of Pec, Kosovo's second-largest city, on tractors and
wagons, clogging a dirt road in a column 12 kilometers (seven
miles) long, according to Western observers.
	   One official said the situation threatens to create as many as
25 new ghost towns in Kosovo, where scores of villages already have
been emptied by shelling or clashes between ethnic Albanian rebels
and an alliance of Serbian police and the Yugoslav army.
	   Kosovo is a province in southern Serbia, the dominant of two
republics left in the Yugoslav Federation. Its population is 90
percent ethnic Albanian, most of whom back the rebels' armed
struggle for independence after decades of repression by Serbian
authorities.
	   ``They're panicking and going everywhere, but they don't know
which way to go,'' said Fernando del Mundo, a spokesman for the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, who heard shelling and saw
billows of smoke in the area Wednesday.
	   Foreign governments and aid organizations fear the worst if
urgent help isn't provided for the 50,000 or so refugees now living
in the hills and forests and facing starvation or freezing this
winter.
	   Western officials have held out the threat of military
intervention for months if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
doesn't halt the offensive. But such plans have been stymied by the
failure to reach an international consensus and by the difficulties
of mounting an effective military action in the mountainous region.
	   Most foreign efforts have focused on supporting Rugova, the
moderate Kosovo Albanian leader, and guiding him and Milosevic to
agreement on ending the conflict.
	   After months of shuttle diplomacy by U.S. envoy Christopher
Hill, the men recently announced tentative agreement on a draft
deal that would stop fighting and restore some of the autonomy
Kosovo enjoyed until 1989, when Milosevic abolished it.
	   But this is rejected by the KLA, which wants full independence.
	   The KLA statement said the interim deal is ``aimed at
demobilizing the masses who have joined the liberation war ...
(and) destruction of the KLA.''
	   Heavily outgunned, the guerrillas have been on the run for much
of the past six months.

Keiko, the movie star whale, comes home

<TEXT>
	   HEIMAEY, Iceland (AP) _ In a Hollywood-style finish, ``Free
Willy'' star Keiko returned home to the waters of Iceland on
Thursday after 16 years in captivity and a career as movie star.
	   An Air Force cargo plane with the world's most famous killer
whale in a holding tank, landed on this windswept archipelago
shortly before 1000 GMT after an eight-hour flight from Oregon.
	   Keiko's handlers hope his return to Iceland will lead to his
transformation from an aquarium performing animal and movie star to
an animal of the wild again.
	   ``He's fine. It was an absolutely smooth trip. The staff is
euphoric!'' said Diane Hammond, spokeswoman for the Free Willy
Keiko Foundation, which owns the whale and is orchestrating his
homecoming.
	   The plane appeared to land normally in stiff headwinds at
Heimaey's airport, but it bounced a little and apparently blew some
tires.
	   The foundation paid the U.S. Air Force to fly Keiko here is a
huge C-17 because it can land on short runways like Heimaey's.
	   ``They blew a few tires. I don't know the status the plane,''
said Gisli Signvgeirsson, a spokesman for the city.
	   A large flatbed truck bearing a ``Welcome Home Willie'' banner
waited to carry his container across town to the waterfront. He
will be loaded onto a barge and taken to a free pen in a protected
cove.
	   In his new sea pen, Keiko will be reintroduced to the sights and
sounds of the waters where he was captured as a 2-year-old. He will
live in his pen, the size of a football field, off the rugged
Westmann Islands until his handlers determine he is able to live on
his own in the wild.
	   Keiko began his latest step toward freedom on Wednesday when he
swam into a holding tank, shimmied into a nylon stretcher and
calmly chirped as he was hoisted out of his home at the Oregon
Coast Aquarium.
	   Bidding the whale goodbye was tough for the children who fell in
love with Keiko from watching his movies and seeing him in his
spacious pool over the past 2{ years.
	   Hundreds of people, some with signs reading ``Keiko, we love
you'' and ``We will miss you,'' lined the highway as a truck
carried the whale on a slow, three-mile (5 km) procession to the
airport.
	   Keiko's bid for freedom has its roots in Hollywood and the hopes
of children around the world.
	   In the 1993 box-office hit ``Free Willy,'' about an orca
threatened by a villainous amusement park owner, the whale played
by Keiko leaps over a breakwall to freedom in the open ocean.
	   Real life, it seemed, wasn't so tidy. It was learned that Keiko
was languishing and deteriorating in a cramped Mexico City tank and
had no prospects of getting out.
	   School kids collected pennies to help save Keiko. Warner Bros.
and cell-phone billionaire Craig McCaw kicked in millions more to
bring the whale to the Oregon tank to recuperate from lung
infections and warty lesions, all with the aim of one day setting
him free.
	   Trying to transform a long-captive whale back into a wild
predator has never been tried before, and whale handlers at
aquariums across the nation have criticized Keiko's move as a
feel-good exercise that puts the whale at risk.
	   Critics say Keiko isn't skilled enough at catching fish, has no
experience interacting with other orcas and could be shocked by the
frigid, harsh conditions of the North Atlantic.
	   Even Keiko's most enthusiastic handlers say it will be at least
two years before they can determine if he can survive in the open
ocean. And they concede he may have spend the rest of his life _ 10
years or more _ in the pen.

Media group confirms talks with Arsenal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS further background

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ One day after Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB network
announced a dlrs 1 billion takeover bid for Manchester United,
another media group said Thursday it was negotiating with London
club Arsenal.
	   Carlton Communications gave no details of the talks with Arsenal
or say whether the discussions involved the possible purchase of
the Premier League champions.
	   ``We have discussed with Arsenal Football Club a range of ways
in which our two companies could work together,'' a company
statement said. ``These discussions are at an early stage.''
	   The announcement came a day after the board of Manchester United
accepted a 623-million-pound (dlrs 1 billion) bid from BSkyB, the
highest amount ever paid for a sports franchise.
	   The Manchester United takeover, which still needs approval by
the club's shareholders and government regulators, sparked
speculation of the possibility of a series of takeovers of soccer
teams by media companies.
	   Arsenal, which also won the prestigious FA Cup last season and
is coached by Frenchman Arsene Wenger, played a scoreless tie with
London rival Chelsea on Wednesday night.
	   Along with Manchester United and Liverpool, Arsenal is one of
the clubs which could take part in a proposed European Super League
starting in 2000.
	   The Gunners, who start their European Champions League campaign
next week against French side Lens, are listed on the Ofex stock
exchange, smaller and more informal than the principal London stock
market.
	   On Wednesday, the club was valued at 162.4 million pounds (dlrs
271 million). After the announcement of the talks with Carlton,
shares soared Thursday and the club was revalued at 176.4 million
pounds (dlrs 294.5 million).
	   There are 56,000 shares in Arsenal. The club is run by chairman
Peter Hill-Wood and vice chairman David Dein.
	   Carlton Communications owns the Carlton Television company in
London and the Midland's Central Television and Westcountry
Television.
	   The group is a major seller of advertising airtime on TV and
cinema, and a 50 percent partner with Granada Group in ON Digital,
the digital TV consortium.
	   While Carlton is smaller than Murdoch's media empire, it has the
television franchise for London as well as a number of others
across Britain.
	   ``After yesterday's Manchester United deal, the big clubs are
realizing it is better to pick your partner and be one of the first
in, rather than hang around,'' said William Davies, a soccer
analyst with London stockbroker Albert E. Sharp.
	   Financial experts now expect Liverpool, Newcastle and possibly
Chelsea to be the next clubs sought after by media companies.
	   Granada, which owns TV franchises in both the Liverpool and
Newcastle area, is considered a potential bidder.

Canadian coach looks for improvement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Canadian swim coach Dave Johnson
rated the rival Australian men's team the best in the world
Thursday ahead of their Commonwealth Games battle.
	   ``You've got to give recognition to the Australian men's team,
whom I consider to be the best in world,'' Johnson said. ``The
United States probably wouldn't like that but that's too bad.''
	   Canada won a single gold medal in the pool at the 1994
Commonwealth games at home. Its total of 19 overall medals was
second to Australia, which finished with 53 medals including 25
gold.
	   Johnson is without two of his leading swimmers here. Olympic
medalist Curtis Myden and female freestyler Shannon Shakespeare
stayed home.
	   ``We will miss Curtis Myden's quiet leadership,'' Johnson
acknowledged. ``He's not an extrovert but puts his money where his
mouth is in the pool.''
	   Australian coach Don Talbot believes Canada and England have
caught up with his team since the pounding those two received four
years earlier. Talbot and Johnson believe the Australian women's
team is vulnerable, and the other countries medal hopes' have
improved accordingly.
	   ``We only won one gold in Victoria and we should be able to
improve on that. But the 19 medals will be a reach for this team,''
Johnson said.
	   Johnson suggested that his squad's biggest rivalry at this meet
will be England _ for second place.
	   ``The English team is very good and we just beat them in
Victoria,'' Johnson said. ``They tell me they're better than us but
we'll find out.''
	   Talbot's biggest concern is Australia's female distance
swimmers, who have failed to match the efforts of the men, such as
15-year-old Ian Thorpe, the 400-meter freestyle world champion, and
1,500-meter champion Grant Hackett.
	   Australia leads the Commonwealth rankings in seven of the 13
men's events and is expected to sweep the relays.
	   Canadian backstroker Mark Versfeld, who holds the Commonwealth
record in the 100-meter event and is top ranked this year in the
200, claimed a silver and bronze at the World Championships and
should beat his Australian rivals here.
	   English butterfly swimmers Stephen Parry and James Hickman are
expected to battle each other for gold in the 200-meter event.
	   In the women's events, England's Susan Rolph is favored to win a
50- and 100-meter freestyle double, although the latter will be one
of the tightest races of the games.
	   Rolph equaled compatriot Karen Pickering's Commonwealth record
of 55.79 seconds at the games trials.
	   Breaststroker Lauren van Oosten and medley star Joanne Malar
could give Canada two more gold.

Volkswagen board to meet on fund for slave laborers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WOLFSBURG, Germany (AP) _ Volkswagen's supervisory board was to
decide Friday on details of a fund to compensate former slave
laborers forced to worked for the firm by the Nazis during World
War II.
	   VW announced in July it would set up a fund to give
``humanitarian aid'' to the survivors, but has not yet said how
much money it will involve or how it will be administered. Company
officials said the questions would be settled at Friday's meeting.
	   Lawsuits and threatened lawsuits have raised the pressure on
German firms to address the claims of concentration camp inmates,
mostly Jews, forced to toil in their factories.
	   German attorney Klaus von Muenchhausen threatened early this
year to file a lawsuit on behalf of 30 Hungarian Jews forced to
work for Volkswagen, but held off on those plans after VW announced
it would set up a fund.
	   Last month, two lawsuits seeking class-action status were filed
in the United States against VW and other German firms on behalf of
former slave laborers.
	   An attorney in one of those lawsuits, Munich-based Michael
Witti, has said Volkswagen's fund plans would be acceptable only if
his clients have substantial input into how the money is doled out.

Indonesia can resolve problems with investors says US official
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A U.S. government agency said Thursday
it was confident Indonesia could solve problems with foreign
investors caused by its economic crisis.
	   George Munoz, chief executive officer of the Overseas Private
Investment Corp., or OPIC, said he hoped ``the Indonesian
government will honor the sanctity of contracts'' with U.S.
companies that have invested in Indonesia, hit badly by Asia's
financial meltdown.
	   Problems ``can be resolved'' through negotiations, Munoz said at
a news conference.
	   OPIC is a U.S. government agency that provides finance and
political risk insurance to U.S. firms in emerging markets.
	   Munoz is visiting Jakarta to meet with Indonesian officials and
representatives of U.S. firms to discuss possible solutions to
problems related the crisis.
	   The Indonesian government is having serious problems paying for
some goods and services from U.S. firms contracted before the
financial crisis struck in July 1997, driving the economy into the
worst crisis in 32 years.
	   The state-owned power company, Perusahaan Listrik Negara, or
PLN, has said it cannot pay money owed to foreign companies
including U.S. power companies, CalEnergy and El Paso, for power
plant projects.
	   PLN says a dramatic fall of the rupiah, Indonesia's currency,
has made it impossible for it to meet dollar-based contracts.
	   Investors say Indonesia's political risk has risen sharply after
mass riots swept the capital city of Jakarta in May, forcing long
reigning President Suharto to step down.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Bowing to bitter opposition from parliament, Boris
Yeltsin nominated his former spy chief Thursday as prime minister
to head emergency efforts to stem the country's economic crisis.
	   Yeltsin nominated acting Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, a
former KGB official, to be prime minister after his first choice,
Viktor Chernomyrdin, asked not to be nominated for a third time.
Leaders on all sides had warned of a political explosion if Yeltsin
again nominated Chernomyrdin.
	   ``In view of the repeated rejection of (Chernomyrdin) ... I ask
the State Duma to confirm the appointment of Yevgeny Maximovich
Primakov as chairman of the government,'' Yeltsin said in a brief
letter.
	   Opposition and pro-government political leaders promptly
welcomed Primakov's nomination, predicting the lower chamber of
parliament, the state Duma, would approve him. A confirmation vote
could come as early as Friday.
	   ``I think he will get the Duma's support. Common sense has
prevailed in our state,'' said Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov,
who spearheaded the opposition to Chernomyrdin. Primakov is ``known
in the country and in the world and can carry out policies
defending the interests of the nation.''
	   The only opposition came from nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky
of the Liberal Democratic Party, who castigated Primakov as an
American puppet.
	   As foreign minister, Primakov was seen as a nationalist, working
to restore some of the international status Moscow lost after the
collapse of the Soviet Union.
	   He briefly was first deputy director of the KGB, the main Soviet
security organization, but it is widely reported he was linked to
the organization for years. Primakov later headed Russia's Foreign
Intelligence Service.
	   Yeltsin announced the nomination after meeting in the Kremlin
with Primakov and Chernomyrdin. Chernomyrdin said he asked the
president not to nominate him after two crushing defeats in
parliament.
	   ``I cannot harm Russia. Russia has had enough upheavals this
century. This is my choice,'' Chernomyrdin said.
	   Yeltsin and the Duma have been locked in a bitter two-week
battle over the premier's post that stalled the formation of a new
government after Chernomyrdin was rejected twice by the Duma.
	   If the Duma rejects Primakov _ an unlikely scenario _ the
president would be forced by law to dissolve parliament and call
new elections.
	   Primakov, 68, a former Soviet foreign policy expert, is seen as
a technocrat, not ideologically linked to any political faction. He
has been criticized in the West for taking a less liberal line on
foreign relations, showing support for Iraq and other regimes at
odds with the West.
	   He was named foreign minister in January 1996 and has been
praised by most of Russia's political factions for doing a good
job.
	   But while Primakov was expected to be approved, it was not clear
whether he would be able to do much to fix the country's economic
crisis. Although seen as a competent administrator, his field of
expertise is foreign relations, not economic policy.
	   Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev picked him as one of his
closest aides during the reform period of the 1980s.
	   In 1989-1990, Primakov was speaker of one of the houses of the
Soviet parliament. In 1990 he became Gorbachev's special advisor
for foreign policy issues and in 1991 became widely known in the
West for his efforts to avert a Gulf War through direct
negotiations with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
	   In December 1991, Primakov was named head of the Russian Foreign
Intelligence Service after years of working in Soviet government
agencies and political think-tanks.
	   Unlike most of Gorbachev's allies, he managed to remain in the
government after the Soviet collapse and has worked closely with
Yeltsin in recent years.
	   Yeltsin had been urged by political leaders on all sides to
agree to a compromise candidate and not propose Chernomyrdin for
the third and final vote. Russia endured a frenzy of political
speculation during the past two days as Yeltsin considered his
options.
	   The political stalemate has exacerbated Russia's economic
collapse, reflected in rising prices and a spread of emergency
measures, such as price controls, in some regions of the country.
	   The country's tattered currency, the ruble, continued Thursday
to bounce back and the Moscow stock market rose in thin trading on
news of Primakov's nomination. Rubles, which were selling at about
20 to the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, rose in street sales to as strong
as 10 to the dollar, although rates varied widely.
	   Foreign currency dealers said the improved rate suggested that
people had exhausted their ruble supply in panic buying and had
begun to exchange their dollar savings.
	   Chernomyrdin spent five years as prime minister before Yeltsin
fired him last March, and many Russians blame him for the country's
economic problems. Yeltsin brought him back as acting prime
minister last month after firing Sergei Kiriyenko.

Top Iraqi Kurd warns of Turks' creating a new Cyprus in Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Turkey's military intervention in northern
Iraq could lead to a Cyprus-style occupation, the Iraqi Kurdish
leader Jalal Talabani warned in remarks published Thursday.
	   The Turkish presence is ``dangerous, in our opinion, and it
threatens Iraqi sovereignty and national unity,'' Talabani told the
London-based, Arabic-language newspaper Al-Hayat.
	   Turkey has apparently maintained several thousand troops in
northern Iraq since May 1997 in a bid to prevent Turkish Kurd
insurgents from crossing into its territory. The Ankara government
refuses to confirm a permanent force in Iraq, saying only that
troops cross into the country whenever necessary.
	   ``We fear that this could be a pretext to create a new Cyprus in
this region,'' said Talabani, who leads the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan. Turkey has occupied the northern third of Cyprus since
1974 when it invaded the island after a coup by supporters of union
with Greece.
	   Talabani was speaking in Iran before heading to Washington for
talks with U.S. officials and his rival, Massoud Barzani of the
Kurdistan Democratic Party.
	   In the past, Talabani's PUK has fought against Turkish forces
carrying out incursions in northern Iraq whereas Barzani's KDP has
supported the Turks.
	   Talabani accused Turkey of using its ``Turkmen brothers'' _
Iraqis of Turkish origin _ as a pretext for entering northern Iraq,
whose population is mostly Kurd.
	   ``The Turkmen number several hundreds of thousands while Turkey
claims that they number three to four million.''
	   Talabani's talks in Washington are expected to deal with ways of
consolidating a cease fire brokered by the United States in May
1997. The PUK and KDP have wrestled for control of the Kurdish
autonomous zone in northern Iraq since the Western allies set it up
in 1991 after Iraqi government forces severely crushed a Kurdish
revolt.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A weakening Japanese yen, overnight losses on
Wall Street and a host of local worries _ including the ailing
financial system in Japan _ dragged Asian markets lower Thursday.
In Tokyo, the Nikkei average of 225 selected issues fell for the
second straight day to end 89.51 points, or 0.6 percent, lower at
14,666.03. Late Wednesday, the Bank of Japan decided it will lower
rates that banks charge each other to borrow money overnight to
around 0.25 percent from the previous 0.5 percent, to prevent a
deflationary spiral. Selling continued however amid persistent
worries over the bad loans burdening Japan's banks and the recent
turbulence in global financial markets. Late Thursday, the U.S.
dollar bought 135.70 yen, up 2.30 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo.
In Kuala Lumpur, the Composite Index was down 9.45 points, or 2.43
percent, to close at 380.20 points. The Philippine share index fell
to a fresh six-year low, pressured by overnight losses on Wall
Street and the weaker peso. The PSE Index ended down 57.26 points,
or 4.9 percent, to close at 1,100.17, its lowest level since
1,109.93 on April 1, 1992. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's leaders guardedly defended Thursday their
decision to loosen up monetary policy by lowering the target for a
key lending rate, admitting it isn't a cure-all but saying it will
give the economy a much-needed boost. Many experts saw even that
claim as overly optimistic. In a surprise announcement, the Bank of
Japan on Wednesday lowered the target for the overnight call money
rate _ the rate banks charge each other for overnight lending
without collateral. The new target is a tiny 0.25 percent, down
from around 0.5 percent. The decision _ the first easing of policy
since 1995 _ does not affect the official discount rate, which is
the central bank's charge on loans to banks. Officials said the
loosening was aimed at helping companies borrow money by making it
cheaper for banks to obtain funds. Japanese banks, foundering under
huge piles of bad debt, have been reluctant to loan out more money,
and that in turn has become a major drag on efforts to pull Japan
out of its worse recession in decades. (JAPAN-CENTRAL BANK)
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Under severe economic pressure due to
its atomic tests, Pakistan will open talks with international
donors Friday on a desperately needed financing package that
appears to hinge on the nation signing a treaty banning nuclear
tests. Major economic powers and global lenders, including the
International Monetary Fund, cut off support to debt-laden Pakistan
as part of sanctions imposed after the nation tested six nuclear
devices in May in response to similar tests by its hostile neighbor
India. Economic sanctions were also imposed on India. Pakistan, a
country of 130 million people, is struggling with dlrs 32 billion
in foreign debt and a shortage of foreign currency. It needs
international loans and credits to meet its foreign debt
obligations. Top government officials have already said Pakistan
may have to stall foreign debt payments and restructure its massive
foreign debt. (PAKISTAN-ECONOMY-NUCLEAR)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Ford Motor Co. and three South Korean
carmakers submitted letters of intent Thursday to take part in a
new auction of bankrupt Kia Motors Corp. It is the second time Kia,
South Korea's second largest auto maker, has been put on the block.
The first auction earlier this month failed to find a buyer. New
bids must be submitted by Sept. 21. The winner will be announced a
week later. Besides Ford of the United States, the other potential
buyers are Hyundai Motor Co., Daewoo Motor Co. and Samsung Motors
Inc. Kia's creditor banks rejected previous bids by the same four
companies because they included demands for a writeoff of at least
part of Kia's 11.8 trillion won (dlrs 8.4 billion) debt. Thursday,
however, the creditors said they would write off 2.9 trillion won
(dlrs 2.1 billion) of the principal along with any interest on the
remainder. Kia and its creditors said the successful bidder must
buy at least 51 percent of the equity of Kia and its commercial
vehicle subsidiary, Asia Motors Corp. Ford already owns 16.9
percent of Kia. (SKOREA-KIA)
	   MORAINE, Ohio (AP) _ The chairman of General Motors Corp. said
the past performance of employees at the company's engine plant in
the Dayton suburb of Moraine made it the logical choice for
production of a new diesel engine. The engine will be a joint
venture between GM and Isuzu Motors Ltd. of Japan. It will be
designed to power medium- and heavy-duty trucks with greater fuel
economy and reduced pollution. The two companies said the 6.6-liter
engine will be produced in a dlrs 300 million plant employing 700
workers, replacing the existing Moraine engine plant, which employs
500 people. Isuzu will own 60 percent of the joint venture, to be
known as DMAX Ltd., and will take the lead in developing the
engine. GM will own the remaining 40 percent. The engine will
feature a process in which fuel is directly injected into the
combustion chamber under high pressure, resulting in a cleaner,
more complete burn. (US-ENGINE PLANT)

Free agent Laettner faces rehabilitation after injury
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DURHAM, North Carolina (AP) _ Christian Laettner, who played the
last 2 1/2 seasons with the Atlanta Hawks, could face up to nine
months of rehabilitation after rupturing his Achilles' tendon in a
pickup basketball game at Duke last week.
	   The former Duke All-American returned to his Atlanta home after
surgery at Duke University Medical Center last week.
	   Neither Laettner nor his agent, Herb Rudoy, was available for
comment.
	   The timing of the injury is bad for Laettner, who became a free
agent after playing out his contract. No free agent signings are
possible until the NBA's current labor impasse is resolved.
	   Laettner missed eight games last season with injuries and lost
his starting forward job over the final 33 games of the season. He
averaged 13.8 points and 6.6 rebounds in 74 games, and 9.8 points
and 4.3 rebounds in four playoff games.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Bowing to bitter opposition from parliament, Boris
Yeltsin nominated his former spy chief Thursday as prime minister
to lead emergency efforts to stem the country's economic crisis.
Yeltsin nominated Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov to be prime
minister after his first choice, Viktor Chernomyrdin, asked not to
be nominated for a third time. Leaders on all side had warned of a
political explosion if Yeltsin had again nominated Chernomyrdin.
Opposition and pro-government political leaders promptly welcomed
Primakov's nomination, predicting the lower chamber of parliament,
the state Duma, would approve him. Confirmation hearings were set
for the weekend. Primakov, 68, a former Soviet foreign policy
expert, is seen as a technocrat, not ideologically linked to any
political faction. (RUSSIA-POLITICS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Thrust into the first presidential impeachment
case since Watergate, the U.S. House of Representatives is moving
rapidly to release some of the ``substantial and credible''
information gathered by prosecutors against President Bill Clinton.
A day after Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr delivered 36 boxes of
impeachment material with extraordinary security, lawmakers planned
Thursday to make public at least 445 pages Friday. The information
would be posted on the Internet. Sources familiar with the report
said it lays out evidence of alleged obstruction of justice,
perjury and abuse of power by Clinton in his effort to conceal his
affair with Monica Lewinsky. Clinton's personal attorney, David
Kendall, immediately went before microphones Wednesday at the White
House to insist, ``There is no basis for impeachment.''
(US-CLINTON-CONGRESS)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian police and soldiers
scattered more than 6,000 protesters who had marched and shouted
for peace Thursday after riot police fired pointblank into
demonstrators, critically wounding a student. Police left them
largely unmolested for about two hours until they massed at the
Independence Monument. An unexpected frenzy of public support for
the marchers reflected intensifying anger against strongman Hun Sen
since he launched a violent crackdown Monday to crush weeks of
calls for his ouster following his disputed victory in
parliamentary elections July 26. Belief is widespread that several
Buddhist monks were killed Wednesday when riot police attacked
thousands of protesters in the streets near the U.S. Embassy and
home of opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh. Human rights
workers on Thursday unearthed two bodies of people who appear to
have been killed Wednesday. (CAMBODIA)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Separatists fighting for Kosovo's
independence criticized the United States and the province's
moderate ethnic Albanian leader on Thursday, saying their support
of a deal with Serbia will destroy the guerrilla struggle. The
statement by the political wing of the Kosovo Liberation Army
expressed anger at the marginalization of the guerrilla movement by
foreign powers. The United States and its allies support both
moderate leader Ibrahim Rugova and a deal to end the conflict that
falls far short of KLA demands for full independence from Serbia.
The drive to find a solution to six months of fighting that has
left hundreds dead and upward of 265,000 homeless received fresh
impetus on Wednesday with news of a new exodus of tens of thousands
of ethnic Albanians from villages under fire in southwestern
Kosovo. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ While Myanmar's military government
continued to arrest the country's democracy activists, a top
general accused Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi of
working with terrorists, state-run newspapers reported Thursday.
Gen. Tin Oo, a top general in the 21-member ruling military
council, said Suu Kyi was working ``in collaboration with
underground terrorists and some superpower countries,'' the New
Light of Myanmar reported. Their goal, he said, was to cause
instability and the disintegration of the nation. Suu Kyi and her
party follow a doctrine of political change through nonviolence.
The military has arrested more than 500 members of Suu Kyi's
political party, the National League for Democracy, since May,
party leaders said Wednesday. The military began rounding up NLD
members this week to prevent the party from convening the
parliament elected in 1990. In addition, the All Burma Students
Democratic Front, an exile group, said more than 300 students have
been arrested. (MYANMAR)

Japan's premier outlines twin plans for economic revitalization
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's prime minister outlined a set of economic
proposals Thursday designed to revitalize the country's
recession-hit industries and improve quality of living standards
for the average Japanese.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi unveiled the plans after a meeting
of a special economic strategy task force which drafted the
recommendations. The centerpiece of the package is a vaguely worded
proposal for doubling the amount of housing, working and recreation
space within five years.
	   ``We have been looking for ideas to overcome the current, very
severe economic conditions and create a brighter future,'' Obuchi
said in a statement.
	   The twin plans are a key part of the embattled Obuchi
administration's answer to mounting concern over the outlook for
the Japanese economy, which shows few signs of pulling out of a
prolonged slump, and longstanding quality of life issues.
	   The recommendations are to be implemented through government
spending and as yet unspecified deregulatory efforts, Obuchi said.
	   In addition to expanding areas for work and play in a nation
accustomed to cramped apartments and offices, the effort aims to
increase the number of new jobs by 500,000 in the next two years,
he said.
	   It will also promote improvements in industrial productivity and
technological prowess, along with encouraging the development of
new business enterprises.
	   On Friday, the Cabinet was expected to formally instruct
government agencies and ministries to begin fleshing out the still
sketchy details in their budgetary requests for the fiscal year
beginning in April.
	   Obuchi's proposals resemble government goals laid out in a
five-year plan approved in 1992 that promised to turn Japan into a
``lifestyle superpower'' _ an attempt to deal with complaints that
living standards have not kept pace with economic growth.
	   High land prices make individual home ownership out of the
question for many Japanese, including some who saw themselves as
middle class.
	   Few public parks and limited greenery in big cities like Tokyo
and the high costs for staple goods such as rice add to the
perception of a low quality of life.
	   But the highly-touted 1992 plan, recommended by a special
advisory panel to then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, was later
abandoned mid-stream after many of its goals appeared unlikely to
be met.
	   By 1994, Japan was feeling the negative impact of the collapse
of its boom-time ``bubble'' economy of the late 1980s.
	   Miyazawa now serves as finance minister in the Obuchi Cabinet.
	   Thursday's proposals came from Obuchi's newly-established
Economic Strategy Council, a 10-member Japanese version of the
United States' Council of Economic Advisers. The panel is dominated
by leading academics and business leaders such as Hiroshi Okuda,
president of Toyota Motor Corp.
	   The wording of the council's lifestyle improvement plan is
similar to that used by former Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda in his
1960 ``Income Doubling Plan'' _ one of Japan's most successful
five-year plans in the postwar era.

Kabila wanted rebel leaders arrested at Zimbabwe peace talks _
</HEADLINE>
report &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Congolese President Laurent Kabila's
government asked Zimbabwe to arrest Congolese rebels who flew to
Zimbabwe for peace talks earlier this week, an independent
newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Justice Minister Emmerson Mnangagwa confirmed receiving the
request Tuesday but said Zimbabwe had no jurisdiction to take the
action, the Financial Gazette reported.
	   He said Zimbabwean authorities were approached by Congolese
judicial official Mwenze Kongolo.
	   A rebel delegation arrived in the northwest Zimbabwe resort of
Victoria Falls on Monday for a two-day peace summit of seven
regional presidents, including Kabila.
	   The talks, convened in hopes of signing a cease-fire deal, broke
down after Kabila and allies who have sent troops to support him _
Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe _ refused to meet face to face with
the eight-member rebel delegation.
	   The rebels walked out of the meeting site after complaining of
harassment by Zimbabwean authorities.
	   Rwanda and Uganda are accused by Kabila of fighting alongside
the rebels to topple him. In Victoria Falls, their presidents
wanted direct talks between the warring sides to end the fighting.
	   Rwanda denies it has sent troops into Congo but Uganda concedes
it has deployed soldiers to protect its borders from Congo-based
Ugandan insurgents.
	   The Financial Gazette reported that Zimbabwe, which has sent
more than 2,800 troops to support Kabila, has videotaped evidence
showing the presence of Rwandan and Ugandan forces deep inside
Congo.
	   It quoted Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe saying he was willing
to release the videos soon.
	   ``Rwanda is just afraid to admit it has troops there but they
are the one with more troops in the Congo than anyone else,''
Mugabe told the paper.
	   Angolan and Zimbabwean troops repulsed a rebel advance on the
Congolese capital of Kinshasa last month.
	   Before the intervention of the allied force, Kabila had lost
hope and was preparing to flee into exile, according to
unidentified Zimbabwe military sources, the paper reported.

Doctor: minister in coma had two consultations ahead of surgery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement, in a
coma after an allergic reaction to anesthesia, had two
consultations ahead of his surgery, the doctor in charge was quoted
Thursday as saying.
	   But Dr. Yves Cudennec of Val de Grace military hospital was
quoted in the weekly magazine Impact Medecin as saying that one of
the consultations was on July 30 -- more than a month ahead of the
planned operation.
	   On Tuesday, the left-leaning newspaper Liberation reported that
Chevenement did not receive the two required anesthesia
consultations before his scheduled gallbladder surgery and was not
given a test for a potential allergic reaction to the anesthesia.
	   Chevenement, 59, has been in a coma since Sept. 2, when he
suffered an allergic reaction to the anesthesia, had a heart attack
and went into a coma. The operation never took place.
	   Chevenement is a regular patient at the elite hospital, Cudennec
was quoted by Impact Medecin as saying, ``and we have an anesthesia
file on him,'' explaining why the patient was not tested for
allergies.
	   The minister had a consultation July 30 and another the day
before the planned surgery, Cudennec said.
	   ``The heart attack occurred two minutes after the injection of
Norcuron ...,'' the magazine quoted the doctor as saying.
	   Norcuron, a curare or muscle relaxer, is a common component of
anesthesia. According to Impact Medecin, it is not one of the
muscle relaxers considered most likely to cause an allergic
reaction, as Liberation had said.
	   The Val de Grace medical team has come under criticism for
failing to provide ample information on Chevenement, a key minister
in the leftist government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
	   Cudennec said the discretion is meant to respect the wishes of
the Chevenement family, France's law on medical secrecy and the
military code.
	   The last bulletin from the hospital was Monday, the third in the
nine days since the incident. It cited improvement but provided no
details.

Indonesia's president calls on Muslim clergy to help restore calm
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Indonesia-Unrest

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Facing mounting protests for him to
quit as food prices skyrocket, President B.J. Habibie Thursday
asked the Muslim clergy to help restore calm across crisis-ridden
Indonesia.
	   ``The advice of religious leaders is like a candle in the
darkness,'' he told a group of 40 Muslim scholars as troops blocked
a protest by hundreds of students outside the state palace in
Jakarta.
	   ``You word can make the people feel at peace and make them
forget about the unrest,'' he said.
	   Habibie said his government is working nonstop to overcome the
worst economic crisis in decades.
	   ``What we need is the people's patience and cooperation,'' he
said.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim,
making it the world's most populous Islamic nation.
	   Habibie said he believed God would reward Indonesians if they
worked hard to overcome Asia's financial meltdown, which has
resulted in soaring inflation, mass unemployment and growing
poverty.
	   Habibie came to power in May after riots and student protests,
in which 1,200 people were killed, forced Suharto to resign after
32 years in power.
	   Although Habibie has said he has done much to attack corruption
and to reform the economy, there has been growing discontent with
his presidency.
	   For the past four days he has been the target of student
protesters who have demanded that he bring down prices of basic
food commodities or resign.

New Zealand, Barbados and South Africa notch wins

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ New Zealand overcame a tenacious
young Kenyan team to win their opening Pool D tie by five wickets
in the Commonwealth Games cricket tournament Thursday.
	   Set a winning target of 145 in 50 overs, New Zealand scored the
required runs in 47.2 overs against its non-Test playing opponent.
	   In Pool C encounters, South Africa downed Northern Ireland by
four wickets and Barbados beat Bangladesh by the same margin in
matches which were delayed by up to three hours by rain. Both
winners had to reach revised victory targets.
	   New Zealand medium pacer Chris Harris was the major contributor
for his team, taking 3-7 off 10 overs and the Kiwis stayed calm
during their run-chase.
	   ``Our patience and deliberate batting, chasing a small total
under difficult conditions, also contributed,'' said New Zealand
captain Stephen Fleming.
	   The Kiwi innings was in early trouble when opener Nathan Astle
was run out for seven in the third over.
	   After the setback, Matthew Horne (39) and left-hander Fleming
(24) stabilized the innings and Craig McMillan added a useful 33.
	   Despite aggressive fielding and a creditable total of 144 for
eight on a slow pitch, and a rain-drenched outfield that prevented
many boundaries, Kenya could not match the experience of the Kiwi
team, which included many Test stars.
	   Kenya's main batting hopes, Stephen Tikolo (9) and Maurice
Odumbe (10), failed to stay at the crease and it was right-hander
Ravindy Shah who topped the scoring with 35 before being run out.
	   Harris got rid of Tikolo, Alpesh Vadher and Sandip Gupta in an
amazing spell which put the brakes on the Kenyan innings.
	   For Kenya, the Suji brothers, Martin and Tony, opened the
medium-pace attack.
	   New Zealand reached the 100-run mark with three wickets down in
the 32nd over. At the same stage the Kenyans had lost five wickets
and scored 15 fewer runs.
	   Barbados, with West Indian batsmen Philo Wallace and Sherwin
Campbell, won the toss and sent Bangladesh in to bat at the
Selangor Turf Club ground.
	   Bangladesh opener Shahrier Hossain scored an unbeaten 70 in his
team's 144-7 off 47 overs before the innings was disrupted by rain.
	   Barbados was set a winning target of 160 in 47 overs and passed
the mark in 41.3 overs. Bangladesh had early joy when Campbell was
out for a duck.
	   Northern Ireland made 89-5 in 38.1 overs against South Africa
before the rain hit. South Africa had a tough revised target of 133
and lost six wickets.
	   After a top-order collapse, captain Shaun Pollock (33) and Dale
Benkenstein (44 not out) guided the South Africans to safety.
	   Sixteen teams are participating in the cricket, a game that is
making its debut in the 1998 Commonwealth Games. But important
cricket playing countries, like England, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and
India have either not send teams or flown in weaker squads.

China calls on Canada to call off minister's Taiwan trip
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China urged Canada Thursday to cancel a visit to
rival Taiwan by a Cabinet-level official to avoid harming
Chinese-Canadian relations.
	   Canadian Industry Minister John Manley was due to make a two-day
trip starting Thursday, in a rare visit to Taiwan by a
Cabinet-level official.
	   Like most countries, Canada has diplomatic relations with
Beijing and, at China's insistence, not with Taipei.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao reiterated that
China's diplomatic partners should limit high-level contacts with
Taiwan, regarded by Beijing as a renegade province with no right to
foreign political ties.
	   ``At present, Sino-Canadian relations have developed smoothly,''
Zhu said at a twice-weekly media briefing. He added that with that
in mind Ottawa should ``adopt concrete measures to cancel this
visit to Taiwan.''
	   Canada's ties with Taiwan should be limited to unofficial
business and trade ``so as to ensure the sound and stable
development of relations between China and Canada,'' Zhu said.
	   Chinese leaders have been urging Taiwan's government to enter
into talks on unification and have relentlessly attacked Taiwanese
efforts to cast off the Beijing-engineered isolation of the island.
The two sides split when Mao Tse-tung's Communists forced Chiang
Kai-shek's Nationalists from the mainland in 1949.
	   Zhu criticized Taiwan's recent appointment of three
ambassadors-at-large, calling it ``only another trick adopted by
the Taiwan authorities'' to promote separatism.
	   The foreign ministry spokesman denounced Nicaragua by name and
other unspecified countries for once again urging the U.N. General
Assembly to consider Taiwan's entry into the United Nations.
	   Nicaragua and the other countries, ``openly defying the wishes
of the majority of U.N. member states, flagrantly interfere with
China's internal affairs'' by supporting Taiwan's bid, Zhu said.
	   ``This kind of draft resolution has been refused by the General
Committee of the United Nations for five consecutive years and this
year it is doomed to failure,'' he added.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Yevgeny Primakov, the man chosen to lead Russia's
government at a time of deep economic crisis, is a former spymaster
and Arab affairs expert who has caused some uneasiness in the West.
	   The low-key, publicity shy Primakov is also a tough and skillful
administrator who enjoys the reputation of a survivor. As foreign
minister he has won respect from both Russian hard-liners and
liberals, and even Western counterparts who are not particularly
fond of his policies.
	   Primakov, 68, has served as foreign minister since the beginning
of 1996 and has weathered repeated Kremlin shakeups. But almost
nothing is known about his plans for reviving Russia's feeble
economy.
	   He has rarely expressed his views on Russian domestic matters,
apart from some hard-line complaints that his huge country must not
simply become a source of raw materials for the West.
	   Still, Russia's divided politicians were full of praise for
Primakov, who appeared likely to win parliamentary approval with
little trouble.
	   ``Primakov stands at an equal distance from all political
forces. He can be trusted with forming a government,'' said
Alexander Shokhin of the centrist Our Home is Russia faction in
parliament.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov hailed Primakov as a
``consolidating figure'' and a sober-minded politician.
	   ``He knows how to implement the state's line, has his own
stance, clearly expresses his opinions and is an experienced
diplomat and politician,'' added Zyuganov.
	   In the West, Primakov is best known as the man who negotiated
with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in December 1990 and January 1991,
in a vain attempt to avert the Gulf War. Primakov made several
trips to Baghdad seeking what he called a ``face-saving'' way for
Saddam to withdraw from occupied Kuwait.
	   Primakov has a cordial, but cool stance toward the West, saying
Russia must not be guided by foreign powers and advocating the
concept of a ``multi-polar'' world, which has become the Kremlin's
official line since he became foreign minister in January 1996.
	   ``There's an effort ... to make the world unipolar'' and
centering around the United States, he wrote in a 1996 article.
``The world should be based on the interests of many states. In a
multi-polar world Russia has to be one of the poles and not join
the others.''
	   Primakov has clashed with Western politicians on several issues
in recent years.
	   He has favored moves toward easing international sanctions on
Iraq, he often disagreed with Western policies during the war in
the former Yugoslavia, and he's a staunch opponent of NATO's
expansion into central and eastern Europe.
	   Primakov also has tried to bring Russia closer to Asian giants
such as China and India as way to counterbalance U.S. global
influence.
	   He also has sought to revive Moscow's ties with traditional
Soviet clients in the Middle East, such as Syria and Iraq.
	   Despite his wary stance toward the West, he's seen as a
pragmatist who maintains friendly relations with Western
politicians, including U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
	   ``He enjoys tremendous respect in the country and abroad,'' said
centrist Russian lawmaker Vladimir Ryzhkov.
	   Primakov, who turns 69 next month, was born in Kiev, Ukraine,
and graduated from Moscow's prestigious Eastern Studies Institute.
	   Primakov began working as a broadcast journalist in 1956, and
from 1962-70 was a correspondent for the Soviet Communist Party
newspaper, Pravda, while based in Arab countries.
	   He became deputy head of the Soviet Union's World Economics and
International Relations Institute in 1970, and was named director
of his former alma mater, the Oriental Studies Institute in 1977.
He returned to head the World Economics Institute in 1985.
	   A longtime Communist Party member, Primakov rose to become an
alternate member of the ruling Politburo in 1989.
	   Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev made Primakov one of his
closest aides during the reform period of the late 1980s,
appointing him a special foreign policy advisor in 1990.
	   Primakov also held a variety of senior posts in the Soviet
parliament and, shortly before the failed August 1991 hard-line
coup, reportedly warned Gorbachev not to trust the KGB secret
service.
	   Primakov denounced the putsch and was soon named first deputy
KGB chief, formally embarking on a career as a spymaster.
	   He was put in charge of Soviet foreign intelligence at the end
of 1991, later heading Russia's new Foreign Intelligence Service.
He was named foreign minister in January 1996. Unlike many of
Gorbachev's former allies, Primakov managed to develop and maintain
a close relationship with Yeltsin.

Russian Gazprom delegation to discuss gas supplies with Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A high-ranking delegation from Russia's gas
giant Gazprom arrives in Kiev late Thursday for talks over future
gas supplies to Ukraine, officials said.
	   The delegation is to meet Ukrainian government officials Friday
to discuss resumption in full of gas supplies to Ukraine and a
possible decrease in price of the Russian gas to the country next
year, said Bohdan Klyuk, deputy chairman of Ukraine's state oil and
gas monopoly Naftogaz Ukrainy.
	   Gazprom reduced gas supplies to Ukraine by 30 percent last week
because of the country's huge debt.
	   Ukrainian officials have put the current debt to Gazprom at dlrs
640 million, of which the government owes about dlrs 500 million
and private traders the rest.
	   The sides are also expected to discuss a long-term bilateral
agreement for supplies of Russian gas to Ukraine. Until now,
Ukraine and Russia have signed one-year contracts for supplies of
gas.
	   Ukraine, the world's sixth largest country in terms of gas
consumption, relies on Russia for about 70 percent of its gas
supplies.
	   The former Soviet republic annually consumes about 80 billion
cubic meters of gas, of which only 18 billion cubic meters comes
from domestic sources.
	   Ukraine's mounting gas debt to Russia has prompted tension
between the two countries. Ukrainian officials said last week the
country's gas debt to Russia would be repaid by October.

Romania and Hungary to form joint military force
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania and Hungary plan to form a
joint military force to help bring stability to the troubled
Balkans, the Romanian defense ministry said.
	   ``Military cooperation between Romania and Hungary represents a
factor of stability in the world we live in,'' a ministry statement
quoted Col. Gen. Ferenc Vegh, Hungary's military commander, as
saying Wednesday.
	   Vegh and his Romanian counterpart, Gen. Constantin Degeratu, are
meeting in Oradea, near the Hungarian border, for talks on the
force and other military cooperation, the statement said.
	   Historical foes, the two nations have patched things up since
reformists came to power in Romania in November 1996.
	   In the past, they have disagreed about who controls the region
of Transylvania. Since it rejoined Romania in 1918, there have been
rifts over Romania's treatment of the 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians
living there.
	   The joint force, which will be set up by the end of this year,
will comprise 800-1,000 soldiers. English will be the language of
communication, the statement said.
	   The first mission will be a military exercise in Bulgaria in
December. Degeratu said ethnic Hungarians living in Romania and
some the few ethnic Romanians living in Hungary will be included.

 &UR; By JASMINA KUZMANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Hong Kong will remain an ideal place for
investments as long as China does not go into recession, a Hong
Kong business leader said Thursday.
	   ``The strongest factor in Hong Kong's favor is its integration
with mainland China,'' said Brian Stevenson, chairman of the
International Committee of the Hong Kong General Chamber of
Commerce.
	   Stevenson, who spoke at a gathering of businessmen and
journalists organized by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in
Singapore, also heads Hong Kong and China operations for the
international auditing firm, Ernst and Young.
	   Among other advantages of Hong Kong, Stevenson noted its rule of
law, a high quality civil service and free flow of information, as
well as good infrastructure and advantageous taxes.
	   But the key business attraction is its connection to China, he
said.
	   China is Hong Kong's biggest trading partner, and Hong
Kong-based firms employ about 5 million people in China. The city
is also likely to benefit from the recent Chinese decision to
privatize another 350,000 state companies.
	   ``Hong Kong companies are uniquely well placed to lead this epic
endeavor, and regardless of recent turbulence, Hong Kong's capital
markets will be the main external source of funding for these
enterprises,'' Stevenson said.
	   But he added that all Hong Kong's prospects will become
questionable if China goes into recession.
	   In addition to feeling the effects of the regional crisis, the
once booming economy of Hong Kong also had to weather the
reunification shock.
	   The return of the former British colony to China in July 1997
initially scared off investors, despite reassurances that the city
would retain a special administrative status for the next 50 years.
	   At present, Hong Kong's projected gross domestic product for
1998 is minus 4 percent, unemployment is the worst in the last 15
years at 4.5 percent, and tourism has been down by 21 percent from
before the handover.
	   Despite these ``extremely depressing readings,'' Hong Kong is
taking actions to ride out the crisis, Stevenson said.
	   He said many companies have cut their work forces and minimized
pay raises, which will enable Hong Kong to recover its economy and
attract new investors.
	   Commenting on the possible devaluation of the yuan, the Chinese
currency, Stevenson said that even that scenario is unlikely to
make Hong Kong drop its peg to the U.S. dollar.
	   ``Hong Kong has reserves ... and it would do everything it can
to not remove the peg,'' he said.

Athletes throwing in towels even before competitions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Forget the medals. It is towels
that are in high demand at the Commonwealth Games village.
	   Athletes and officials are claiming that the attractive
multi-colored striped bath towels issued to them have been lost,
misplaced or stolen; and they want new ones.
	   At first officials obliged but now, they say, enough is enough.
``The rule now is: `If you lose your towel, you buy your own,'''
said Mohammad Idris Hassan, the manager of residential zone at the
village.
	   The suspicion is that some people are stashing away their towels
in their bags as souvenirs and getting fresh ones for use during
the games. Or, they leave towels unattended at swimming pools or at
training centers and others succumb to temptation.
	   ``It has become like a collectors item,'' Hassan said.
``Everybody seems to want them.''
	   Hassan put up a large notice in the lobbies of the high-rise
apartments for participants, saying authorities have ``been rather
generous'' in issuing new towels to those who asked.
	   ``As a result ... our stock has depleted and we are no longer
able to entertain any more such requests,'' the notice said.
	   The games began on Wednesday but the athletes arrived several
days earlier and the first medals will be won only on Saturday.
	   Hassan said there was a lesson from the towel episode for Sydney
2000 Olympics and Manchester 2002 Commonwealth Games organizers:
don't make towels so attractive that they become souvenir items.
	   The towels come in different colors and are emblazoned with the
official logo of the Commonwealth Games. Some 16,000 were donated
by a sponsor and each of the 5,000 plus athletes and officials was
given three each.
	   Hassan said that since he put up the notice on Tuesday, he
hasn't had ``a single report'' of stolen towels.

Clinton names choice for U.S. Ambassador to Malaysia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. President Clinton said he
will nominate career diplomat B. Lynn Pascoe as U.S. Ambassador to
Malaysia, the U.S. Embassy said Thursday.
	   Pascoe will succeed John Malott, who has served in the Southeast
Asian nation for three years.
	   Pascoe has been a member of the Foreign Service for 30 years and
is the special negotiator for Armenia and Azerbaijan over
Nagorno-Karabakh and regional conflicts in the newly independent
states.
	   Pascoe has worked as senior adviser in the State Department's
East Asian and Pacific Affairs Bureau and at the U.S. mission to
the United Nations. He has also served at U.S. embassies in
Beijing, Moscow, Hong Kong and Bangkok.
	   Clinton announced the nomination Wednesday. Following
confirmation by the Senate, Pascoe will replace Malott, whose
three-year term ends in January 1999.
	   Malott plans to leave government service to enter the private
sector, the statement said.

Former MI5 agent can seek legal aid to avoid extradition from
</HEADLINE>
France &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A judge on Thursday granted a renegade former
British intelligence agent permission to try to get the government
to pay for his legal battle against extradition to Britain from
France.
	   Judge Stephen Richards overturned a ruling last month by a
magistrate that David Shayler, wanted in Britain to face charges
under the Official Secrets Act, was not eligible for legal aid from
the state because he has not been charged with an offense in
England.
	   The judge said Shayler's case was at least arguable. The appeal
will be heard within two weeks.
	   Shayler's lawyer, John Wadham, said he was determined to prevent
his client from ``being convicted for merely telling the truth.''
	   Shayler, 32, who worked for Britain's internal MI5 intelligence
agency from 1994 until 1997, fled to France last year after selling
stories about the agency's operations to a British newspaper, The
Mail on Sunday.
	   He maintains, among other things, that Britain plotted the
assassination of of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi _ an allegation
the goverment denies.
	   Libya also has asked France to extradite Shayler, or to allow
Libyan judicial authorities to question him in France.
	   Shayler was arrested in Paris on Aug. 1 after living with his
girlfriend in a remote part of rural France. He is being held in La
Sante prison without charge.

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ While fighting raged in Congo,
African and U.N. leaders made a renewed effort Thursday to achieve
a cease-fire despite three previous failures.
	   Rebels trying to oust Congolese President Laurent Kabila were
not invited, said Ibrahim Dagash, spokesman of the Organization of
African Unity, host of the latest round of peace talks.
	   A Congolese rebel delegation stormed out of negotiations in
Zimbabwe on Tuesday, just before a draft of a cease-fire agreement
was expected to be signed. Fighting immediately surged in eastern
Congo.
	   Rebel-run Radio Bukavu said insurgents and government-backed
militiamen clashed near Bukava, a lakeside town on the border with
Rwanda.
	   Refugees fleeing across Lake Tanganyika to Tanzania told U.N.
workers that the government recaptured the southeastern town of
Kalemie on Wednesday.
	   Neither report could be confirmed independently.
	   Although the rebels left the Zimbabwe summit, neighboring
countries embroiled in the Congolese conflict agreed to try to work
out a cease-fire, withdrawal of foreign troops and political reform
in Congo.
	   The rebels trying to unseat Congo's year-old government claim
Kabila has failed to implement democratic reforms and has worsened
ethnic hatred.
	   Among those expected to attend the two-day peace conference,
scheduled to begin Thursday afternoon, were the defense ministers
of Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, whose armies have backed Kabila.
Congo also sent its defense minister.
	   The defense ministers of Uganda and Rwanda, which supported
Kabila's ouster of dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and whom Kabila claims
are now supporting the rebels, also were expected. Rwanda denies
its troops are backing the rebels. Uganda admits it has troops in
Congo, but says they are only protecting its borders from attack by
Ugandan rebels.
	   Zambia, which has remained neutral, also sent its defense
minister.
	   OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim and a team of U.N.
advisers also were expected to participate.
	   ``What we see is a process moving in the right direction, and
the secretary-general wants to offer whatever support he can,''
Fred Eckhard, a spokesman for U.N. chief Kofi Annan said Wednesday.
	   The failed summit in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe marked the third
formal attempt at a peace deal since the conflict began Aug. 2, and
the only time rebels were invited.

South Korean guards return home from Russia

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Four South Korean men returned home
Thursday, a week after they were held captive and taken to Russia's
Far East by a runaway ship, maritime police said.
	   Kang Jung-min, 53, and three others were on board the Russian
trawler Gerol Shronintsy last week when it sailed away from
court-ordered custody in Pusan port on South Korea's southeast
coast.
	   A Pusan court hired them to enforce its order to impound the
4,475-ton vessel after is failed to pay dlrs 1.45 million in ship
repair to Daewoo Heavy Industries in Keoje on the south coast.
	   The ship sailed back to the Russian Far East port of Vladivostok
Sept. 3 with its 38 crew and the Koreans on board and sent back the
guards by another Russian ship that arrived in Pusan Thursday.
	   In June, a Russian refrigerator ship, Tibiya, broke similar
court-ordered custody and ran away with two South Korean guards on
board after failing to pay dlrs 1.5 million in repair debt.
	   The two Koreans were set free a week after the ship arrived in
Vladivostok.

Keiko, the movie star whale, comes home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HEIMAEY, Iceland (AP) _ In a Hollywood-style finish, ``Free
Willy'' star Keiko returned home to the waters of Iceland on
Thursday after 16 years in captivity and a career as a movie star.
	   A U.S. Air Force cargo plane, with the world's most famous
killer whale in a holding tank, landed on this windswept
archipelago shortly before 1000 GMT after an eight-hour flight from
Oregon.
	   Keiko's handlers hope his return to Iceland will lead to his
transformation from an aquarium performing animal and movie star to
an animal of the wild again.
	   ``He's fine. It was an absolutely smooth trip. The staff is
euphoric!'' said Diane Hammond, spokeswoman for the Free Willy
Keiko Foundation, which owns the whale and is orchestrating his
homecoming.
	   ``For the children of the world, this is a wonderful event and
these airflifters showed that they can take anything anyplace
anytime,'' said Air Force Secretary F. Whitten Peters. He said the
Air Force was proud the mission went so smoothly.
	   The huge plane appeared to land normally in stiff headwinds at
Heimaey's airport, but there was a small problem.
	   ``A piece of the right landing gear failed as the plane
landed,'' said U.S. Air Force spokeswoman Capt. Maria Karl. ``But
the landing itself was very smooth.''
	   ``Water came squishing out of Keiko's box when we landed but
actually the landing felt great,'' said Bob Ratliffe, executive
director of the Keiko foundation.
	   And the star passenger?
	   ``He was calm throughout the night. He's feeling terrific,''
Ratliffe said.
	   The foundation paid the U.S. Air Force to fly Keiko here because
the huge C-17 can land on short runways like Heimaey's.
	   A couple of hundred curious townsfolk dotted the landscape as
Keiko's tank was maneuvered from the plane to the waiting flatbed
truck with its ``Welcome Home Willie'' banner. After a trip through
town, Keiko will be loaded onto a barge and taken to a sea pen _
the size of a football field _ in a protected cove.
	   There he will be reintroduced to the sights and sounds of the
waters where he was captured as a 2-year-old. He will live in his
pen, off the rugged Westmann Islands, until his handlers determine
he is able to live on his own.
	   Keiko began his step toward freedom on Wednesday when he swam
into a holding tank, shimmied into a nylon stretcher and calmly
chirped as he was hoisted out of his home at the Oregon Coast
Aquarium.
	   Bidding the whale goodbye was tough for the children who fell in
love with Keiko after watching his movies and seeing him in his
spacious pool over the past 2 1/2 years.
	   Hundreds of people, some with signs reading ``Keiko, we love
you'' and ``We will miss you,'' lined the highway as a truck
carried the whale to the airport.
	   Keiko's bid for freedom has its roots in Hollywood and the hopes
of children around the world.
	   In the 1993 box-office hit ``Free Willy,'' about an orca
threatened by a villainous amusement park owner, the whale played
by Keiko leaps over a breakwall to freedom in the open ocean.
	   Real life wasn't so tidy. It was learned that Keiko was
languishing in a cramped Mexico City tank.
	   School kids collected pennies to help save Keiko. Warner Bros.
and cell-phone billionaire Craig McCaw kicked in millions more to
bring the whale to the Oregon tank to recuperate from lung
infections and warty lesions, all with the aim of setting him free.
	   Trying to transform a long-captive whale back into a wild
predator has never been tried before, and whale handlers at
aquariums have criticized Keiko's move.
	   Critics say Keiko isn't skilled enough at catching fish, has no
experience of other orcas and could be shocked by the frigid, harsh
conditions of the North Atlantic.
	   Even Keiko's most enthusiastic handlers say it will be at least
two years before they can determine if he can survive in the open
ocean. And they concede he may have spend the rest of his life _ 10
years or more _ in the pen.

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Border guards detained 79 illegal
aliens on Thursday in two separate incidents.
	   Fifty five Kosovo Albanians were caught trying to illegally
cross into Slovakia, where they need an entry visa, said Col.
Attila Krisan, a border guards spokesman. They were caught at
Nagyloc, 80 kilometers (50 miles) northeast from Budapest, while
waiting for their guide.
	   The Afghans crossed the Ukrainian-Hungarian border at

Moriguchi, Higo share lead in Japan LPGA Championship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIHOMURA, Japan (AP) _ Kaori Higo and veteran Yuko Moriguchi
shot 2-under par 70s Thursday to share a one-stroke lead after the
opening round of the 70 million yen (dlrs 518,000) Japan LPGA
Championship.
	   Moriguchi, winner of 41 tournaments in 23 years as a pro, sank
four birdies against a double bogey over the hilly 6,550-yard
(5,961-meter) Miho Golf Club course.
	   ``I think I played well, especially on the front nine, except
the out of bounds at No. 13,'' said the 43-year-old Moriguchi, in
contention for her first victory in four years.
	   On the par-5 13th, Moriguchi reached the green in five shots and
two-putted for double bogey.
	   ``You have to keep the ball in the fairway off the tee,''
Moriguchi added. ``The rough is so punitive, it's going to be
difficult to score from it.''
	   Higo, seeking her first title of the season and sixth overall,
had a round of four birdies and two bogeys. ``It's nice to get off
to a good start in a big tournament like this.''
	   The tournament is one of three major events on the Japan LPGA
Tour.
	   Yumiko Akagi, a non-winner in eight years on the tour, shot a
71.
	   Another stroke back at 72 were Michiko Hattori and Ayako
Shibata.
	   Hiromi Kobayashi, winner of the Rainbow Foods LPGA Classic on
the U.S. tour last month, fired a 75.
	   Defending champion Akiko Fukushima shot a 76.
	   The winner will receive a top prize of 12.6 million yen (dlrs
93,300) and a five-year exempt status on the tour.

FC Barcelona hopes Kluivert and Pellegrino are ready for league's
</HEADLINE>
debut &QL; 
 &UR; By MAR ROMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ It's Spain's top soccer club, but you'll be
hard pressed to find any Spaniards in the lineup.
	   Fullfilling Dutch coach Louis Van Gaal's pledge to renovate the
club, FC Barcelona is expected to field two new foreign imports _
Dutch striker Ptrick Kluivert and Argentine forward Mauricio
Pellegrino _ in Saturday's game against Extremadura.
	   Kluivert, who was signed from AC Milan, joins other five Dutch
players at Barcelona: Ruud Hesp, Michael Reiziger, Winston Bogarde,
Boudewijn Zenden and Philip Cocu. Pellegrino is the first Argentine
to join the defending league champion this season.
	   Madrid sports daily Marca reported Thursday that Van Gaal's
starting lineup against Extremadura may include only one Spaniard,
defender Sergi Barjuan.
	   Saturday's clash against Extremadura will give Barcelona its
first appearance at home and an opporunity to further re-establish
its credibility after a disspapointing goaless draw with Racing de
Santander in the opening round.
	   Founded in 1928, the humble, working-class Extremadura club has
regained the Spanish top division after a year in the second
division, a feat that set off celebrations last June in the small
southwestern farm town of Almendralejo.
	   It gets a first test of its capabilities Sunday when facing
15-time league champion FC Barcelona in only its second match of
the new season.
	   Elsewhere, Real Madrid will travel to Valladolid. Real Madrid
easily defeated a humble Villareal in the first round with young
ace Raul Gonzalez, Brazilian striker Savio and Yugoslav Predraj
Mijatovic as scorers.
	   The European champions, who came in fourth last season in the
domestic league, are widely tipped as having the best shot at
snatching the leage title from Barcelona.
	   Fans will be looking to Spanish international Jose Luis Caminero
back to Valladolid after six years at Atletico de Madrid.
	   Atletico de Madrid will be playing first division newcomer
Salamanca on Saturday. A team that gained both the League and the
King's Cup in 1996, Atletico fell to seventh last year and has lost
its first game already this season against Valencia.
	   While not spending as much as Barcelona or Real Madrid on new
players, Atletico was just as aggressive, acquiring six new
foreigners, including Yugolsav international Vladimir Jugovic.
	   Zaragoza, which defeated Athletic de Bilbao 2-0 last week,
travels to Sevilla to face Betis on Saturday,
	   Having never won a Spanish league title since its founding in
1932, it's a situation the Zaragoza club doesn't want to get too
excited about just yet.
	   ``We've got to stay calm,'' said Zaragoza's coach Jose Francisco
Rojo 'Txetxu'. ``It's important to be on top but more so to be
there at the end of the season.''
	   Other Saturday matchups: Tenerife vs. Real Sociedad, Deportivo
de La Coruna vs. Valencia, Villareal vs. Celta, Athletic de Bilbao
vs. Racing de Santander.
	   On Sunday, Oviedo will host Alaves and Mallorca receives
Espanyol.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes roared low over
Lebanon's capital Thursday after guerrillas killed four pro-Israeli
militiamen in southern Lebanon.
	   Lebanese anti-aircraft guns opened fire on the eight Israeli
jets as they zoomed over Beirut, rattling windows as one fighter
broke the sound barrier twice.
	   Witnesses said they saw no sign of the planes being hit. Air
traffic controllers at Beirut airport said the eight jets flew on
toward the northern port of Tripoli.
	   The flight appeared to be a show of force after Iranian-backed
guerrillas killed four members of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon
Army in a roadside bombing about midday (0900GMT) near Jezzine, a
town about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Beirut.
	   Israeli artillery retaliated for the bombing by firing on
suspected guerrilla hideouts in nearby hills. There was no word of
casualties.
	   The Hezbollah group said its guerrillas had carried out the
attack on an SLA vehicle.
	   It was the second time in two days that Hezbollah have killed
SLA members. On Wednesday a similar bomb attack killed two
militiamen and wounded five others.
	   Hezbollah is trying to oust 1,500 Israeli troops and 2,500
militiamen from a border zone that Israel has occupied in Lebanon
since 1985 in a bid to protect its northern settlements from
guerrilla attacks.

Stephens will survive under pressure, says coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australian cycling coach Shayne
Bannan believes drug-tainted rider Neil Stephens will be able to
put the Tour de France controversy behind him at the Commonwealth
Games.
	   Stephens has been chosen for the road race despite testing
positive for excessive EPO as a member of the Festina team.
Stephens said he was given the banned substance without his
knowledge, an excuse accepted by Australia's Commonwealth Games
Association.
	   Earlier this week, Malaysian Sports Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin
Yassin objected to Stephens' selection. Top Australian Olympic
officials have also raised concerns.
	   ``He's really looking forward to this race and riding with his
fellow Australians and friends,'' Bannan said Thursday. ``He's a
pretty tough, experienced guy. He's come here with one objective in
mind and that's to do as much as he can for his teammates. If
you're ever going to have 100 percent confidence about a bloke
getting on the line to do a job, he's that guy.''
	   The international cycling governing body, UCI, has ordered
Australia to prepare a report on possible sanctions against
Stephens, but the report is not due until Oct. 1, after these
games.
	   It is believed Stephens met with Cycling Australia officials
Thursday to discuss the matter.
	   Stephens was among nine members of the French-Spanish Festina
team kicked out of the Tour de France in July after team boss Bruno
Roussel admitted to doping within the squad.
	   He later spent a night in French police custody to answer
questions as authorities investigated the possible smuggling of
illegal performance-enhancing substances by team members.
	   EPO, or erythropoietin, is a naturally occurring hormone that
boosts the red blood cell count, increasing endurance.
	   Athletes can improve their performance greatly by taking the
synthetic version, but if the dosages are not monitored the
practice can be fatal. There now is no accurate test to distinguish
between synthetic and natural EPO. Cycling authorities test for EPO
and suspend riders who register counts about a certain level.

Turkish minority leader sees ethnic peace endangered
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ A leader of Bulgaria's ethnic Turks
warned on Thursday that the destruction of a monument on orders of
regional authorities had left ethnic peace endangered.
	   Ahmed Dogan, leader of the mainly Turkish Movement for Rights
and Freedoms party, alluded to last week's destroying of a Turkish
memorial in the village of Tranak in Eastern Bulgaria.
	   ``The government undermines the main democratic values and puts
a most serious challenge for the ethnic peace in the country,''
Dogan told a news conference.
	   But he added that his party ``will not initiate the destroying
of peace.''
	   Local authorities last week ordered the dismantling of a
memorial for three Turks, executed in 1985 by the then ruling
Communists as terrorists. The country's Turkish minority _ some 10
percent of the 8.5 million population _ honors them as heroes.
	   For years in the 1980s, Bulgaria's Turks were under pressure to
change their names and were deprived of the rights to use their
language, religion and customs. The forced assimilation campaign
ended in 1989, after 320,000 Turks fled to Turkey.
	   The three Turks were found guilty of several bombings that
killed eight people and injured more than 50.
	   ``We respect the victims of the `assimilation process' but we
cannot allow that terrorists are honored,'' Interior Minister
Bogomil Bonev said recently on state radio.

Pesticides and chemicals are target of new treaty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Aiming to protect people and the
environment in developing countries, representatives from 80
nations prepared to sign a new treaty Friday that tightens rules on
pesticides and other hazardous chemicals.
	   The international treaty, sponsored by the United Nations'
Environment Program and the Food and Agriculture Organization, will
require companies to get official government permission before
exporting such material.
	   If a country consents, chemical companies will have to provide
information about the potential health and environmental damages of
the product.
	   The accord covers 22 pesticides and five industrial chemicals,
including the pesticide DDT.
	   Currently, there are about 70,000 chemicals on the market. The
treaty is intended to protect developing nations who cannot control
all of the chemicals entering their borders.
	   Many pesticides that are banned or restricted in industrialized
countries, such as DDT, are still being marketed to developing
nations, said Ennelie Kohl of the Dutch environment ministry.
	   ``This treaty is very important, especially for developing
countries,'' Kohl said.
	   Developing countries made a strong showing at a treaty
conference which began Thursday. All African countries were
represented, Kohl said, and almost all of them sent ministers to
sign the agreement on Friday.
	   After the representatives sign the treaty, the countries must
then ratify it.

Doctors to strike against hospital reform
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Doctors across Greece will begin multiple
strikes against a government plan to scrap a rotating emergency
room duty system at hospitals, it was reported Thursday.
	   Unions everywhere but Athens plan a five-day strike at all
public hospitals starting Friday, with physicians in the capital
beginning their own three-day walk out on Monday. Staff will only
treat serious cases.
	   Doctors are protesting a government decision to abolish a system
under which a region's hospitals rotate emergency room duty. If a
hospital is not on duty, it will often not accept emergency cases.
	   The system has been criticized for wasting time and sometimes
forcing patients to travel great distances to reach a duty
hospital.
	   The government wants each major hospital to have a permanent and
fully functioning emergency room by the end of the year.
	   Doctors don't disagree with the government proposal, but argue
that hospital resources are dangerously over-stretched and that
extra staff and funds are needed for the new system.
	   They also want a 10 percent pay hike and satisfaction of several
other long-standing demands.
	   According to the World Bank, Greece gives less than 5 percent of
its gross national product for health, the lowest level of funding
in the European Union after Portugal.

Twin brothers lifting weights for opposing teams, England and

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) - The Yule twins used to be rival
weightlifters in their father's garage. Now, a decade later, the
22-year-old men are competing on an international stage.
	   Stuart Yule is representing Scotland in the Commonwealth Games,
but his brother, Tom, is on the team from England because he lives
there and residency rules require it.
	   ``I suppose I do feel Scottish, but I definitely don't feel like
an Englishman,'' said Tom, who dodges the dilemma of his national
identity by trying to win simply for himself.
	   ``Three years ago, I knew I wouldn't be able to lift for
Scotland,'' he said in an interview at an apartment complex called
the ``village'' where thousands of athletes are staying.
	   ``I wasn't very happy at the time,'' he said. ``But then you
come to realize that it doesn't really matter who you're competing
for.''
	   The games, held every four years, open Friday and end Sept. 21.
Some preliminary events have already been held.
	   The Yule twins' father lifted weights and their mother
represented Scotland in the shot put at the Commonwealth Games in
the 1970s. Twelve years ago, the couple and their South
African-born sons moved to England.
	   While Stuart returned to his homeland, Tom chose to stay on and
study engineering science at Oxford University before taking a
research job at Manchester Metropolitan University. His time in
England obliged him to compete under the Union Jack.
	   The two brothers won't compete directly, because Tom is in a
higher weight category than Stuart, whose training was disrupted
years ago when he took time off because of injuries.
	   ``Even if you have two weeks off, because of the strength
levels, you go way down,'' Tom said. ``If you have a whole year
off, it's like starting again. I've always been training so I'm
always making continual progress.''
	   Seated at his brother's side, Stuart said he would end up
cheering for Tom.
	   ``When it comes to an individual sport, I think it's the
individual that you see, not the nationality,'' said Stuart, who is
this year's Scottish Open champion in the 94-kilogram (207-pound)
class. He graduated last year from the University of Edinburgh with
a degree in general science.
	   The bulky twins are genial, at ease with one another as they
describe how they used to trail their father, also named Tom, into
the garage of their house to work out alongside him.
	   ``It is a bit weird, twin brothers representing different
nations,'' Tom said. ``But there's nothing that can be done about

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Police and soldiers scattered
thousands of protesters who had marched and shouted for peace
Thursday after riot police fired point-blank into demonstrators,
critically wounding a student.
	   The marchers, who built up strength from a few hundred to more
than 6,000 people as bystanders joined in, were applauded and
cheered from balconies and storefronts as they filed through the
city. They included hundreds of saffron-robed Buddhist monks.
	   The unexpected frenzy of public support for the marchers
reflected intensifying anger against strongman Hun Sen.
	   Hun Sen has launched a violent crackdown Monday to crush weeks
of calls for his ouster following his disputed victory in
parliamentary elections July 26.
	   Police left them largely unmolested for about two hours until
they massed at the Angkor-style Independence Monument, when about
150 elite Flying Tiger police arrived, joined by 150 police on
motorcycles and soldiers in trucks.
	   They circled the crowd, then started moving toward it. The
marchers scattered into a nearby park and toward the Mekong river.
No shots were initially fired and the police did not immediately
start using clubs.
	   The police, backed up by four fire trucks with water cannon,
kept the protesters on the move, following them to different parts
of town and keeping them from regrouping and settling in anywhere.
An occasional stone was hurled their way.
	   Eventually, the police seemed to tire of the game and left. The
marchers regathered at Independence Monument and cheered what they
considered a victory.
	   ``If we're afraid, we'll never find peace,'' said Vann Heng, 18.
``This could be the last chance we have to express our opinions.''
	   Belief is widespread that several monks were killed Wednesday
when riot police attacked thousands of protesters in the streets
near the U.S. Embassy and home of opposition leader Prince Norodom
Ranariddh.
	   Human-rights workers unearthed two bodies from a shallow grave
near the airport Thursday. One was a 19-year-old man shot in the
abdomen and beaten until his skull was destroyed. The other was
still being exhumed. They appeared to have been killed Wednesday.
	   Human-rights workers had said Wednesday that a monk had been
killed by riot police, but an exhaustive search of hospitals and
morgues never produced a body. A motorcycle taxi driver was killed
by police gunfire Monday.
	   Earlier Thursday, hundreds of protesters, mostly motorcycle taxi
drivers and students, had gathered near the U.S. Embassy, a focal
point of unrest since riot police using clubs, guns, shock batons
and water cannon destroyed a protest camp Tuesday.
	   Police soon arrived and smashed a makeshift shrine honoring
monks shot Wednesday. As soon as the police left, the crowd rebuilt
it. The police returned and kicked it apart again. A few rocks were
thrown.
	   Five police opened fire with Kalashnikov rifles, two aiming into
the crowd. An 18-year-old student, Tour Khunnaruth, was struck in
the neck and critically wounded. He was rushed to a hospital. His
mother fainted while describing his injuries to The Associated
Press.
	   The protesters played cat-and-mouse with police for several
hours, then launched their march from the Independence Monument as
the skies opened with seasonal rains.
	   The weather cleared as they marched past the National Assembly
and the mounds of dirt that remain from the protest camp, dubbed
Democracy Square, destroyed by Hun Sen's security forces Tuesday in
a failed bid to crush demands for an end to his 13 years in power.
	   Police stationed at Democracy Square fired a few warning shots
in the air but let the cortege pass. It picked up strength as it
passed the Royal Palace, followed a road along the Mekong River,
and veered into the city's main covered market before heading back
to the monument.
	   They shouted: ``Peace! Peace!''
	   The Association of Southeast Asian Nations urged both sides to
``exercise restraint, avoid violence, including extremists acts''
and to respect the outcome of the elections.
	   Hun Sen won a parliamentary majority but lacks the two-thirds
needed to form a new government. The opposition alleges massive
electoral fraud and is withholding support.
	   ASEAN postponed Cambodia's membership after Hun Sen deposed
Ranariddh in a coup last year. The violence this week has been the
worst since then, undermining the new legitimacy Hun Sen was
seeking from the election.
	   However enthusiastic, the crowds seemed to lack direction now
that Ranariddh's opposition ally, Sam Rainsy, a master at public
protest, is threatened with arrest and seeking refuge at local U.N.
offices.

Konishiki receives fair play trophy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) - The first foreign sumo wrestling
champion received the Pierre de Coubertin fair play trophy Thursday
for his ``lifelong contribution to sumo'' and ``fair-play
wrestling.''
	   Konishiki, who weighs 265 kilos (584 pounds), arrived in Prague
from Rome with his wife late Wednesday and boarded a special van
with only one long seat inside for the ride to his hotel.
	   The Hawaiian-born 36-year-old, whose real name is Salevaa
Atisanoe, ended his 15-year career last year.
	   He peaked in 1987 when he became the first foreign wrestler to
reach the rank of ozeki, or champion, sumo's second highest rank.
He became a Japanese citizen in 1994.
	   Time eventually caught up with the wrestler. He lost his ozeki
ranking in 1993 and had been struggling with injury and illness
since. He has chronic problems with his knees and legs.
	   ``I want to lose weight down to 100 kilos (220 pounds) within
the next three or four years,'' Konishiki told the CTK news agency
after arrival.
	   He said his 45-kilogram (100-pound) wife had already prepared a
special diet for him.

Yeltsin assures Germany that Primakov would stick to reform course
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin assured
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl by phone Thursday that his new choice
for prime minister would stick to market reforms if confirmed, the
government said.
	   In the telephone conversation, Yeltsin also promised the new
government will do everything to overcome the dangers for Russia's
economic development, Kohl spokesman Otto Hauser said in a news
release.
	   Bowing to pressure from the Russian parliament, Yeltsin
nominated Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, his former spy chief,
to be prime minister Thursday after his first choice, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, withdrew his name.
	   Russia's opposition-dominated parliament twice refused to
confirm Chernomyrdin. But both opposition and pro-government
politicians in Russia welcomed Primakov's nomination. A
confirmation vote could come as early as Friday.
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said Primakov could be the
man to reconcile Russia's parliament and executive branch.
	   He said he has long been friends with Primakov and is convinced
that he will not support a return to a Soviet-style command
economy.
	   ``Primakov definitely earns our trust,'' Kinkel said.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ More than 1,000 troops and police
guarded the state palace Thursday to block some 700 student
protesters who demanded President B.J. Habibie lower soaring food
prices or quit.
	   It was the fourth straight day of bold student protest against
the embattled leader, struggling against Indonesia's worst economic
crisis in 30 years while trying to reform its autocratic political
system.
	   There were no reports of arrests or injuries.
	   Riot police with sticks and shields moved in as students
assembled in an adjacent park. Some waved banners at the base of
Indonesia's towering National Monument and then marched toward the
palace.
	   A roadway was blocked by army trucks as lines of security
personnel moved within a few meters (yards) of the students and
contained them on three sides after their numbers swelled.
	   Chanting demonstrators sat down on the pavement several hundred
meters from the palace itself. They peacefully dispersed after
about three hours.
	   Discontent with Habibie's crisis-bound presidency has been
mounting. Looting and riots fueled by climbing food prices have hit
several areas in recent weeks.
	   On Monday, students marched on Parliament and tore down the
gates of the legislature.
	   Troops and police used sticks, shields and tear gas to evict
them from its grounds on Tuesday.
	   On Wednesday a visit by Habibie to Indonesia's second-largest
city, Surabaya, was marred when 4,000 students and opposition
supporters protested.
	   Thursday's demonstration _ the first major protest outside the
palace complex since Habibie took office more than three months ago
_ came despite warnings from the powerful military pledging support
for the president.
	   As many as 600 troops armed with rifles were stationed near the
white pillared colonial, Dutch-built palace, which is flanked by a
collection of buildings that house the offices of Habibie and other
senior government officials.
	   Habibie held a series of meetings inside the complex as the
protest went on.
	   He asked a group of Muslim leaders to help calm the nation and
to convince overwhelmingly Islamic Indonesia to be patient with his
efforts to fix things.
	   Habibie later discussed the progress of a painful economic
reform program with International Monetary Fund officials.
	   Like the students outside, the IMF's top man in Asia, Hubert
Neiss, called for immediate action to stop the price of rice from
rising to prevent the potential of more unrest.
	   The protesting students, many wearing brightly colored jackets
that are the uniforms of their universities, demanded lower food
prices and called on Habibie's authoritarian predecessor President
Suharto to be put on trial for corruption.
	   They also demanded that the armed forces give up a
constitutionally sanctioned role in politics under which it is
represented in the Cabinet and the Parliament.
	   Unlike other student demonstrations this week, Thursday's
protesters stopped short of demanding that Habibie quit
immediately.
	   ``We are putting pressure on Habibie,'' said Indra Fatrimanto, a
protest organizer. ``He must stabilize prices. If he can't then he
must step down.''
	   ``People are hungry, lower prices,'' read one banner.
	   The demonstration was peaceful, although witnesses said police
stopped another 100 students from entering the park from a nearby
railroad station.
	   Habibie came to power in May after riots and student protests,
in which 1,200 people were killed, forced Suharto to resign after
32 years in power.
	   Although Habibie has said he has done much to attack corruption
and nepotism, officials fear that as many as half of Indonesia's
202 million people could fall into poverty.
	   Habibie has warned that unless checked, the crisis could
threaten national unity in the world's fourth most populous country
that consists of more than 300 ethnic groups on about 17,000
islands.

Violence continues in Macau: Reports
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS travel agency targeted in May, other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Despite tightened security, gang-related
violence has continued to spread in Macau, including a suspected
arson Thursday at a travel agency, Hong Kong media reports said.
	   A motorcycle was pushed in front of the travel agency and set on
fire but no one was injured, Television Broadcast reported.
	   The travel agency was also targeted in May, when it was one of
22 premises hit in a two-hour arson rampage, it said.
	   Television reports showed police in bullet-proof vests armed
with machine guns patrolling the streets, while police dogs sniffed
for bombs.
	   Several people were evacuated from the building, but the fire
was quickly put out, TVB reported.
	   The arson came only two days after a home-made bomb injured five
police officers and 10 journalists after they were lured to the
scene by a nearby blast.
	   Macau Police said it was a ``two-pronged'' attack by the
criminal underworld on police and journalists covering criminal
activities.
	   No arrests have been made, and Macau police have tightened
security in the tiny Portuguese enclave, 40 miles (70 kilometers)
west of Hong Kong.
	   The enclave famous for its gambling and tourism industries has
come to the spotlight after a spate of gangland-style shooting
deaths, arson and other attacks _ many targeting government
officials.
	   Police say they believe the recent series of violence is linked
to gang wars over gambling profits that have been shrinking because
of Asia's economic slump.
	   Three government officials, including a gambling inspector, have
been killed since March.

South African trade federation announces protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa's largest trade
federation called for a 24-hour strike to protest privatization of
government services and demanded an immediate moratorium to the
sale of state enterprises.
	   The nationwide ``mass action'' -- a day of marches, picketing
and demonstrations -- is a sign of increasing strain between the
Congress of South African Trade Unions and the African National
Congress, which dominates government.
	   Cosatu, the ANC's ally in fighting apartheid, has a formal role
in policy-making.
	   No date was announced, but the strike should take place in the
next several weeks, the federation said.
	   Cosatu charged that the government was abdicating its
responsibilities by turning over services to private contractors in
poor, black areas while local authorities handle them in wealthier,
mainly white locales.
	   ``We believe the private sector should only supplement the role
the government plays,'' the union said, alleging that private
services would bring higher costs and lack of accountability.
	   Cosatu noted the plight of around 12 million South Africans
still waiting to be connected to water services.
	   Cosatu said it would call on all local governments to suspend
any privatization plans while it holds talks with the government of
President Nelson Mandela.
	   ``We are also mobilizing our members to support this campaign,''
the union said. ``We believe it is in the interest of all South
Africans, particularly the poor, that government remains the key
provider of basic services.''
	   Cosatu is the umbrella organization for about 2 million people,
including health, mine, municipal, education and metal workers.

Ukraine's parliament rejects nominee for privatization post
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The leftist-dominated parliament on
Thursday failed to approve the state privatization chief, raising
doubts about the government's plans to speed up privatization in
the country.
	   Oleksandr Bondar, President Leonid Kuchma's nominee to head the
State Property Fund, received 210 votes in parliament, 16 less than
needed for a simple majority.
	   Kuchma is to propose a new nominee within two weeks.
	   Under Ukraine's constitution, the head of the state
privatization agency must be approved by parliament.
	   Kuchma has been in a non-stop feud with parliament over how to
conduct privatization since he was elected president in 1994.
	   Lawmakers rejected Kuchma's previous candidate for the top
privatization post, Volodymyr Lanoviy, four times, making him serve
as an acting State Property Fund chairman. The legislators
frequently found fault with his work, and he had limited authority.
	   In addition, parliament has introduced a number of measures in
the past that seriously hampered the State Property Fund's efforts
to quicken privatization.
	   Privatization in Ukraine, which showed signs of revival at the
beginning of 1998, has nearly ground to a halt due. Foreign
investors have fled the region due largely to the continuing
financial crisis in neighboring Russia.
	   The former Soviet republic has earned about 250 million hryvna
(dlrs 99 million) from privatization since the beginning of 1998,
and the figure has remained virtually unchanged since June.
	   The government earlier set the privatization revenue target for
this year at 1 billion hryvna (dlrs 395 million).

World War II shell kills three Ukrainians, injures one
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Three people were killed and another
injured when they tried to take apart a World War II artillery
shell found in eastern Ukraine, officials said Thursday.
	   The incident occurred Wednesday near the village of
Hromadyanskiy in Kharkiv region, the Emergency Situations Ministry
reported.
	   A villager was killed and another badly wounded in the same
region last month in a similar accident. Two people, who tried to
dismantle a war-time shell in central Ukraine, were killed in July.
	   World War II shells and bombs are frequently found in Ukraine,
which was the scene of heavy fighting between Soviet and German
armies in World War II. Dozens of shells have been discovered in
the summer following rainfalls, floods and repair works.
	   Emergency officials say Ukrainians often ignore warnings not to
handle such bombs and shells.

Nazi war crimes trial postponed indefinitely
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LIUDAS DAPKUS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ A court on Thursday ordered an
indefinite postponement in the Nazi war-crimes trial of Aleksandras
Lileikis, whom his lawyers say is to ill to attend the proceedings.
	   The court said it would appoint a medical commission to
determine if the 91-year-old Lileikis is too sick to speak in his
own defense.
	   The trial was to have opened Wednesday, after a number of delays
that prompted criticism from Jewish groups who contend that
Lithuanian authorities are trying to draw out the procedures until
Lileikis dies.
	   The trial was postponed for one day on Wednesday after Lileikis'
attorneys said he was hospitalized. On Thursday, the court accepted
a hospital report saying he suffers from a number of ailments,
including poor circulation to the brain.
	   If the commission determines that Lileikis is unable to speak in
his own defense, the trial likely would never be held. Lileikis
could be tried in absentia only if were trying to unlawfully evade
trial, or if he were abroad and refused to return to Lithuania, the
three-judge panel said Thursday.
	   Lileikis, who was head of the Vilnius security police during the
1941-44 Nazi occupation, is charged with genocide for allegedly
ordering scores of Jews to be arrested and handed over to a Nazi
execution squad.
	   About 90 percent of Lithuania's prewar Jewish population of
240,000 died during the Nazi occupation.
	   Lileikis emigrated in 1955 to the United States, and lived in
Norwood, Massachusetts, where he worked for a Lithuanian publishing
house.
	   Based on documents that came to light after the dissolution of
the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States began steps to revoke
Lileikis' citizenship on the grounds that he lied about his past.
	   Lileikis returned to Lithuania in 1996, but it was not until
early this year that he was charged. Jewish groups have accused
Lithuanian authorities of dragging their feet in hopes of avoiding
a trial.
	   The criticism continued on Thursday, with Efriam Zuroff of the
Nazi-hunting Simon Wiesenthal Center asking ``If Lileikis feels
innocent, why doesn't he come here and prove it?''
	   But spectator Petras Cidzikas, reflecting the views of many,
said he was pleased that the proceedings against Lileikis could be
over.
	   ``I believe this is the last sitting of this shameful trial,''
he said.

Paper alleges doctor on anti-doping panel prescribed illegal drugs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A doctor on France's just-installed commission to
examine the use of performance-enhancing drugs in sports allegedly
prescribed illicit drugs to a cyclist ahead of the 1997 Tour de
France, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The 1998 edition of the cycling classic was tainted by a doping
scandal that spurred officials to look for ways to resolve the
widening problem of use of such drugs in sports.
	   Le Monde said that Dr. Armand Megret prescribed Diprostene and
Decadron to a cyclist whose name was not revealed.
	   The drugs were placed on a French list of drugs containing
doping substances that was set up in 1994.
	   Megret, questioned by Le Monde, said he ``assumes full
responsibility,'' saying the drugs were supplied to treat a medical
problem.
	   ``I was suffering from bronchitis that I couldn't beat with
antibiotics,'' the cyclist was quoted by the newspaper as saying.
``For the start of the Tour, I absolutely needed to be well.''
	   Megret was quoted as saying that in sports medicine such
prescriptions are sometimes given to treat real ailments. ``That
has nothing to do with the doping that's been going on for the past
two years,'' he was quoted by Le Monde as saying.
	   Megret is on a commission installed Tuesday and set up by Sports
Minister Marie-George Buffet and Health Minister Bernard Kouchner
to ``curb the plague of doping.''
	   The apparently widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs in
sports became clear during the summer's Tour de France. The Festina
team was expelled after its sports director revealed an organized
system of providing drugs to team cyclists. Other teams are under
investigation.

Guerrillas blast United States, Kosovo's moderate Albanian leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with ethnic Albanian reports on refugee situation,
Tanjug denial
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Separatists fighting for Kosovo's
independence blasted the United States and the province's moderate
Albanian leader on Thursday, saying their support of a deal with
Serbia will destroy the guerrilla struggle.
	   The statement by the political wing of the Kosovo Liberation
Army expressed fury at the marginalization of the guerrilla
movement by foreign powers.
	   The United States and its allies support both moderate leader
Ibrahim Rugova and a deal to end the conflict that falls far short
of KLA demands for full independence from Serbia.
	   The drive to find a solution to six months of fighting that has
left hundreds dead and upward of 265,000 homeless received fresh
impetus on Wednesday with news of a new exodus of tens of thousands
of ethnic Albanians from villages under fire in southwestern
Kosovo.
	   The victims fled villages in an area about 30 kilometers (18
miles) south of Pec, Kosovo's second-largest city on tractors and
wagons, clogging a dirt road in a column 12 kilometers (seven
miles) long, according to Western observers.
	   One official said the situation threatens to create as many as
25 new ghost towns in Kosovo, where scores of villages already have
emptied by shelling or clashes between ethnic Albanian rebels and
an alliance of Serbian police and the Yugoslav army.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to Rugova, reported that
``tens of thousands'' of refugees were encircled Thursday morning
by Serb forces in Istinic village, south of Pec.
	   Another 10,000, mostly women, children and elderly, were
reportedly stuck on Streoc mountain, west of the Pec-Decani road
without food or water, and thousands more were streaming toward the
mountain, which leads to the border with Montenegro.
	   The center also said Serb forces were burning houses as they
advanced.
	   Yugoslavia's official Tanjug news agency criticized the reports
of a new refugee exodus as meant to deflect attention from Serbian
claims of massacres of civilians by the KLA.

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes blasted suspected
guerrilla hideouts and roared low over Beirut Thursday after
guerrillas killed four pro-Israeli militiamen in southern Lebanon,
security officials said.
	   Two Israeli jets fired a missile each at guerrilla targets
outside the town of Mashghara at 2:30 p.m. (1130GMT), the officials
said.
	   The jets appeared to be pursuing guerrillas who had detonated a
roadside bomb that killed four members of the Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army about three hours earlier.
	   Black smoke billowed from the area which is over the mountains
from the site of the bombing outside the town of Jezzine, a town
about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Beirut. There was no
word of casualties from the air strike.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman said warplanes struck
``terrorist targets'' in southern Lebanon, but gave no other
details.
	   Earlier Thursday, Lebanese anti-aircraft guns opened fire on
eight Israeli jets as they flew low over Beirut, rattling windows
as one fighter broke the sound barrier twice.
	   Witnesses said they saw no sign of the planes being hit. Air
traffic controllers at Beirut airport said the eight jets flew on
toward the northern port of Tripoli.
	   The flight appeared to be a show of force after the roadside
bombing, the second such attack in two days. On Wednesday a similar
bomb killed two militiamen and wounded five others.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah group said its guerrillas had
carried out Thursday's attack on a militia vehicle.
	   Hezbollah is trying to oust 1,500 Israeli troops and 2,500
militiamen from a border zone that Israel has occupied in Lebanon
since 1985 in a bid to protect its northern settlements from
guerrilla attacks.

Six Anderlect fans in jail follwing hooligan riots

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Six Anderlecht fans remained in jail
Thursday after hooligans rioted during a Belgian league match
against FC Brugge and injured 13 policemen.
	   Anderlecht fans leaving the Constant Vanden Stock stadium when
their team was already trailing 3-0 Wednesday, turned violent and a
few hundred of them tried to break into the clubhouse and parking

	   Police held them off and fought pitched battles with them all
around the Vanden Stock stadium before a water cannon dispersed the
fans. A few dozen fans were detained and six of them remained
behind bars on Thursday.
	   The fans were outraged because Anderlecht was losing against
archrival FC Brugge, worsening the crisis at Belgium's most famous
club, which is currently last in the league standings.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes blasted suspected
guerrilla hideouts and roared low over Beirut Thursday after
guerrillas killed four pro-Israeli militiamen in southern Lebanon,
security officials said.
	   Two Israeli jets fired a missile each at guerrilla targets
outside the town of Mashghara at 2:30 p.m. (1130GMT), the officials
said.
	   The jets appeared to be pursuing guerrillas who had detonated a
roadside bomb that killed four members of the Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army about three hours earlier.
	   Black smoke billowed from the area which is over the mountains
from the site of the bombing outside the town of Jezzine, a town
about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Beirut. There was no
word of casualties from the air strike.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman said warplanes struck
``terrorist targets'' in southern Lebanon, but gave no other
details.
	   Earlier Thursday, Lebanese anti-aircraft guns opened fire on
eight Israeli jets as they flew low over Beirut, rattling windows
as one fighter broke the sound barrier twice.
	   Witnesses said they saw no sign of the planes being hit. Air
traffic controllers at Beirut airport said the eight jets flew on
toward the northern port of Tripoli.
	   The flight appeared to be a show of force after the roadside
bombing, the second such attack in two days. On Wednesday a similar
bomb killed two militiamen and wounded five others.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah group said its guerrillas had
carried out Thursday's attack on a militia vehicle.
	   Hezbollah is trying to oust 1,500 Israeli troops and 2,500
militiamen from a border zone that Israel has occupied in Lebanon
since 1985 in a bid to protect its northern settlements from
guerrilla attacks.

Ford, three Korean car makers to bid for Kia Motors Corp.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS spelling of `principal' in 6th-7th grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Ford Motor Co. and three South Korean
car makers submitted letters of intent Thursday to take part in a
new auction of bankrupt Kia Motors Corp.
	   It is the second time Kia, South Korea's second largest auto
maker, has been put on the block. The first auction earlier this
month failed to find a buyer.
	   New bids must be submitted by Sept. 21. The winner will be
announced Sept. 28.
	   Besides Ford of the United States, the other potential buyers
are Hyundai Motor Co., Daewoo Motor Co. and Samsung Motors Inc.
	   Kia's creditor banks rejected previous bids by the same four
companies because they included demands for a writeoff of at least
part of Kia's 11.8 trillion won (dlrs 8.4 billion) debt.
	   The creditors had offered to write off interest on that debt
over the next 10 years, an estimated 6.5 trillion won (dlrs 4.6
billion), but none of the principal.
	   Thursday, however, the creditors said they would write off 2.9
trillion won (dlrs 2.1 billion) of the principal debt along with
any interest on the remainder.
	   Kia and its creditors said the successful bidder must buy at
least 51 percent of the equity of Kia and its commercial vehicle
subsidiary, Asia Motors Corp. Ford already owns 16.9 percent of
Kia.
	   The move to sell Kia is part of the government's effort to
restructure its battered economy under a dlrs 58 billion bailout
from the International Monetary Fund.
	   Kia's collapse in July, 1997, helped erode investor confidence
in South Korea's bloated, inefficient industries, leading to a
flight of capital.
	   Kia and Asia have 7.7 trillion won (dlrs 5.7 billion) in assets.
Kia produced 780,000 cars in 1997. Asia Motors can turn out 250,000
vehicles, mostly trucks and buses. The two companies employ more
than 18,000 workers.

	   HEIMAEY, Iceland (AP) _ In a Hollywood-style finish, ``Free
Willy'' star Keiko returned home to the waters of Iceland on
Thursday after 16 years in captivity and a career as a movie star.
	   A U.S. Air Force cargo plane, with the world's most famous
killer whale in a holding tank, landed on this windswept
archipelago shortly before 1000 GMT after an eight-hour flight from
Oregon.
	   Keiko's handlers hope his return to Iceland will lead to his
transformation from an aquarium performing animal and movie star to
an animal of the wild again.
	   ``He's fine. It was an absolutely smooth trip. The staff is
euphoric!'' said Diane Hammond, spokeswoman for the Free Willy
Keiko Foundation, which owns the whale and is orchestrating his
homecoming.
	   ``For the children of the world, this is a wonderful event and
these airflifters showed that they can take anything anyplace
anytime,'' said Air Force Secretary F. Whitten Peters. He said the
Air Force was proud the mission went so smoothly.
	   The huge plane appeared to land normally in stiff headwinds at
Heimaey's airport, but there was a small problem.
	   ``A piece of the right landing gear failed as the plane
landed,'' said U.S. Air Force spokeswoman Capt. Maria Karl. ``But
the landing itself was very smooth.''
	   ``Water came squishing out of Keiko's box when we landed but
actually the landing felt great,'' said Bob Ratliffe, executive
director of the Keiko foundation.
	   And the star passenger?
	   ``He was calm throughout the night. He's feeling terrific,''
Ratliffe said.
	   The foundation paid the U.S. Air Force to fly Keiko here because
the huge C-17 can land on short runways like Heimaey's.
	   A couple of hundred curious townsfolk dotted the landscape as
Keiko's tank was maneuvered from the plane to the waiting flatbed
truck with its ``Welcome Home Willy'' banner. After a trip through
town, Keiko will be loaded onto a barge and taken to a sea pen _
the size of a football field _ in a protected cove.

Yeltsin nominates Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov as premier
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES at end with Chernomyrdin warning of communist plot to
seize power &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos Available &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY RENFREW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Bowing to bitter opposition from parliament, Boris
Yeltsin nominated his former spy chief Thursday as prime minister
to head emergency efforts to stem the country's economic crisis.
	   Yeltsin nominated acting Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, a
former KGB official, to be prime minister after his first choice,
Viktor Chernomyrdin, asked not to be nominated for a third time.
Leaders on all sides had warned of a political explosion if Yeltsin
again nominated Chernomyrdin.
	   ``In view of the repeated rejection of (Chernomyrdin) ... I ask
the State Duma to confirm the appointment of Yevgeny Maximovich
Primakov as chairman of the government,'' Yeltsin said in a brief
letter.
	   Opposition and pro-government political leaders promptly
welcomed Primakov's nomination, predicting the lower chamber of
parliament, the state Duma, would approve him. A confirmation vote
could come as early as Friday.
	   ``I think he will get the Duma's support. Common sense has
prevailed in our state,'' said Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov,
who spearheaded the opposition to Chernomyrdin. Primakov is ``known
in the country and in the world and can carry out policies
defending the interests of the nation.''
	   The only opposition came from nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky
of the Liberal Democratic Party, who castigated Primakov as an
American puppet.
	   As foreign minister, Primakov was seen as a nationalist, working
to restore some of the international status Moscow lost after the
collapse of the Soviet Union.
	   He briefly was first deputy director of the KGB, the main Soviet
security organization, but it is widely reported he was linked to
the organization for years. Primakov later headed Russia's Foreign
Intelligence Service.
	   Yeltsin announced the nomination after meeting in the Kremlin
with Primakov and Chernomyrdin. Chernomyrdin said he asked the
president not to nominate him after two crushing defeats in
parliament.
	   ``I cannot harm Russia. Russia has had enough upheavals this
century. This is my choice,'' Chernomyrdin said.
	   Yeltsin and the Duma have been locked in a bitter two-week
battle over the premier's post that stalled the formation of a new
government after Chernomyrdin was rejected twice by the Duma.
	   If the Duma rejects Primakov _ an unlikely scenario _ the
president would be forced by law to dissolve parliament and call
new elections.
	   Primakov, 68, a former Soviet foreign policy expert, is seen as
a technocrat, not ideologically linked to any political faction. He
has been criticized in the West for taking a less liberal line on
foreign relations, showing support for Iraq and other regimes at
odds with the West.
	   He was named foreign minister in January 1996 and has been
praised by most of Russia's political factions for doing a good
job.
	   But while Primakov was expected to be approved, it was not clear
whether he would be able to do much to fix the country's economic
crisis. Although seen as a competent administrator, his field of
expertise is foreign relations, not economic policy.
	   Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev picked him as one of his
closest aides during the reform period of the 1980s.
	   In 1989-1990, Primakov was speaker of one of the houses of the
Soviet parliament. In 1990 he became Gorbachev's special advisor
for foreign policy issues and in 1991 became widely known in the
West for his efforts to avert a Gulf War through direct
negotiations with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
	   In December 1991, Primakov was named head of the Russian Foreign
Intelligence Service after years of working in Soviet government
agencies and political think-tanks.
	   Unlike most of Gorbachev's allies, he managed to remain in the
government after the Soviet collapse and has worked closely with
Yeltsin in recent years.
	   Yeltsin had been urged by political leaders on all sides to
agree to a compromise candidate and not propose Chernomyrdin for
the third and final vote. Russia endured a frenzy of political
speculation during the past two days as Yeltsin considered his
options.
	   The political stalemate has exacerbated Russia's economic
collapse, reflected in rising prices and a spread of emergency
measures, such as price controls, in some regions of the country.
	   The country's tattered currency, the ruble, continued Thursday
to bounce back and the Moscow stock market rose in thin trading on
news of Primakov's nomination. Rubles, which were selling at about
20 to the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, rose in street sales to as strong
as 10 to the dollar, although rates varied widely.
	   Foreign currency dealers said the improved rate suggested that
people had exhausted their ruble supply in panic buying and had
begun to exchange their dollar savings.
	   Chernomyrdin spent five years as prime minister before Yeltsin
fired him last March, and many Russians blame him for the country's
economic problems. Yeltsin brought him back as acting prime
minister last month after firing Sergei Kiriyenko.
	   Speaking in a televized address to the nation, Chernomyrdin said
the parliament's refusal to confirm him was part of a Communust
plot to force Yeltsin to resign and seize power. ``It's a creeping
coup,'' he said.
	   He reproached Yeltsin for making concessions to the opposition.
``Show will! Remember what the Munich pact led to,'' he said in a
reference to the 1938 deal when Britain and France appeased Nazi
Germany, adding that Russia faces a growing fascist threat.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ World squash No. 1 Peter Nicol of
Scotland cruised through the first round of the Commonwealth Games
tournament Thursday, winning in 13 minutes.
	   The top three seeds dropped just two points among them as No. 2
seed Jonathon Power and No. 3 Rodney Eyles also passed effortlessly
into round two.
	   Nicol beat Guyana's Regan Pollard 9-0, 9-0, 9-1.
	   ``I moved well, conditions were great, they suit my game,''
Nicol said of his speedy win. ``Today's match was more of a warm-up
for me.''
	   Prince Edward, a Commonwealth patron and keen squash player,
arrived in time to watch England's world No. 5-ranked Simon Parke
advance with a 9-0, 9-0, 9-1 victory over South African schoolboy
James Letlake.
	   Letlake has emerged from a development program launched in the
Soweto township in 1992 and is the first colored player to
represent his country in squash.
	   Canada's Power, the world No. 3, who beat Nicol last month at
the Hong Kong tournament and is 6-0 against the Scot, was also an
easy winner, downing Sri Lanka's Saman Thilekaratna 9-0, 9-1, 9-0
in 14 minutes.
	   ``I'm all fired up for the big event,'' said Power. ``The
environment and the court seem to suit me very well here.''
	   Australian Eyles crushed Tanzania's Amos Lwiza without dropping
a game.
	   ``I am playing well,'' he said. ``I could not be happier with
the way I performed in this game.''

Orthodox and Eastern Rite Catholics brawl over contested church
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Orthodox faithful brawled with Eastern
Rite Catholics in northwest Romania in an outburst of violence over
who owned a church, police said Thursday.
	   The fracas broke out Tuesday in the town of Ardud, 450
kilometers (280 miles) northwest of Bucharest, after Orthodox
faithful changed the lock on the church, being used by both
religions while a court decides ownership.
	   Unable to enter for evening service, Catholics confronted the
local Orthodox priest. More than 50 people were involved in the
subsequent fight, said Maj. Ion Ardlean, speaking by phone from the
town of 7,000.
	   No arrests were made and the incident is being investigated, he
said. There were no reports of injuries.
	   Eastern Rite Catholics, whose authority is the Pope, have
worshipped freely since 1989 when communism ended. Romania's second
largest religion, they are seeking the return of some 70 churches
and two cathedrals taken by the Communists and given to the
Orthodox in 1948.
	   Nine tenths of Romanians are Orthodox. The Orthodox say each
community should decide to whom the church belongs.
	   The pope is expected to visit Romania next year and Orthodox
bishops are saying that the pontiff's visit should go ahead only if
Catholics cease taking such disputes to the courts.

Officers seize more than 200,000 pirated video compact discs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Customs officials seized more than 200,000
pirated video compact discs worth 2 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 259,000) after raiding stores Thursday in a busy shopping
mall.
	   Twenty-nine people, aged between 17 and 25, were arrested when
customs officers of the Intellectual Property Investigation Bureau
raided 26 shops in Hong Kong's busy Mongkok district, a government
statement said.
	   The pirated discs were of a Japanese television drama series.
The raid was carried out following weeklong negotiations between
the Hong Kong government and Japan's Council for the Protection of
Copyright of Television Programs, the statement said.
	   Hong Kong has come under international pressure, especially from
the United States, to do a better job of protecting intellectual
property. Washington has placed Hong Kong on a watch list for
copyright violations.
	   Despite frequent raids, stores selling pirated compact discs or
CD-ROMs still thrive in Hong Kong. Copies of local or Hollywood
movies are widely available for under 40 Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 5) _ sometimes before they're released in local cinemas.
	   On Wednesday, customs officials seized more than 50,000 pirated
compact discs worth about dlrs 116,000 (U.S.) after a series of
raids in the same district.
	   The biggest seizure of pirated discs was in April, when officers
of Hong Kong's anti-corruption agency seized 7 million pirated
video discs and production equipment worth U.S. dlrs 83 million.

Minister: top Italian fugitive Licio Gelli arrested
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian and French police captured one of Italy's
leading fugitives, financier Licio Gelli, who had been convicted in
one of the country's top corruption scandals, Italy's interior
minister announced Thursday.
	   RAI state TV said Gelli was arrested in Cannes, a French resort
near the Italian border.
	   Napolitano told RAI it was ``premature'' to say when Gelli might
be extradited to Italy.
	   Gelli was under house arrest in his Tuscan mansion when he
disappeared in May. In April, Italy's highest court upheld his
conviction on charges of complicity in the 1982 fraudulent
bankruptcy of the Milan-based Banco Ambrosiano, once Italy's
largest private bank, and sentenced him to 12 years and eight
months in prison. The collapse followed the bank's failure to
collect dlrs 1.3 billion in loans made to dummy companies in Latin
America.

Leading Iranian dissident denied bail, access to lawyers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Amir-Entezam is cq. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ A former deputy prime
minister, who was Iran's longest-held political prisoner before
being freed in 1996, is being detained without bail or access to
his lawyers, an Iranian newspaper and a human rights group say.
	   Abbas Amir-Entezam was arrested Tuesday, reportedly on
defamation charges, Iran's Akhbar daily said.
	   Amir-Entezam was Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan's deputy when
Bazargan briefly held power after the 1979 Islamic revolution.
	   He was was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1979 on charges of
spying for the United States, then released in 1996, without
explanation. Amir-Entezam, who is in his mid-50s, has since been an
outspoken critic of Iran's Islamic government.
	   The paper quoted his wife, Elahe, as saying that Amir-Entezam
was summoned to the court to answer charges of defamation against
Assadollah Lajevardi, a former prosecutor assassinated last month.
	   Following Lajevardi's death in Tehran, Amir-Entezam publicly
condemned prison conditions and the treatment of prisoners during
Lajevardi's tenure as head of Iran's Prisons Organization.
	   The defamation charges were filed by Lajevardi's son,
Amir-Entezam's wife told the newspaper.
	   She said the judge had refused a request for bail, and that
Amir-Entezam was taken to jail after being brought home for a brief
meeting with her. She has not heard from him since, the paper said.
	   Meanwhile, New York-based Human Rights Watch said Amir-Entezam's
wife went to see her husband in jail the next day, but was told
that a suspended life sentence against him had been reinforced.
	   ``Amir-Entezam is being punished for his statements exposing
harsh conditions in Iranian prisons and the widespread use of
torture,'' said Hanny Megally, an executive director at HRW.
	   Amir-Entezam, who never received a trial, has vowed to fight on
against Iran's Islamic government until it clears his name.
	   Despite official permission to leave the country, he has refused
to do so, afraid he would not be allowed to return. He has not seen
his three children, who live in the United States, for 20 years.
	   The Berkeley-educated Amir-Entezam was awarded one of Austria's
highest human rights awards in 1997.

Alleged middleman in drug judge bribery case surrenders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai man wanted by police as a
suspected middleman in an alleged bribery of two Thai judges has
surrendered to police, a television report said Thursday.
	   Police say the bribery was to win bail for reputed drug lord Li
Yun-chung, a suspect in the smuggling of the biggest heroin
shipment ever seized in the United States, in 1991.
	   Nattarat Charuensuk has been charged with being the middleman in
bribing two judges to allow Li's release on 5 million baht (then
worth dlrs 200,000) bail on Feb. 7, 1997, despite an outstanding
request from the United States for his extradition, ITV television
station said.
	   Li, a Burmese-born ethnic Chinese with Thai residence, was
sought by the United States in connection with the shipment of 486
kilograms (1,070 pounds) of heroin seized in Oakland, California.
	   Li, also know as Phongsak Rogjanasakul, fled to Myanmar after
being granted bail, but was arrested by the military government
there and deported to Thailand in May 1997.
	   He was soon sent on to the United States, where he had been
indicted by a federal court for narcotics trafficking.
	   The two Thai judges involved were fired last November by
Thailand's Judicial Commission for their roles in the affair.

British runner breaks world long distance record
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ British runner Robert Garside broke the
world long distance running record Thursday in the West Australian
outback, but said he couldn't crack open a bottle of champagne.
	   ``About 15 to 20 kids had come out from the local school to join
me for the record,'' Garside said Thursday night. ``I would have
liked to have had some champagne, but felt I couldn't do it in
front of the kids.''
	   The record fell about 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) outside Norseman
on the Eyre Highway when he eclipsed the old mark of 17,814.4
(11,134 miles) held by American Sarah Lovington-Fulcher.
	   Garside, who embarked on his quest from London's Piccadilly
Circus in December 1996 with a backpack and US dlrs 25 in his
wallet, said his journey is only half completed.
	   He plans to traverse North and South America and parts of Africa
after his Australian leg, which will take him across the Nullarbor
plain to Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney.
	   He estimates he'll cover 54,000 kilometers (33,750 miles) in 53
countries. (djp)

Trimble, Adams discuss Northern Ireland's new government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES grafs 14-15 with Mallon comment, trims pvs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Another symbol of Northern
Ireland's polarized past was shattered Thursday as Protestant
leader David Trimble and Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams discussed in
detail the formation of a new compromise government.
	   ``I think we can do business,'' predicted Adams, who spoke
directly with Trimble for the first time Monday at the Stormont
Parliament Building in east Belfast.
	   Thursday's encounter at the same venue went into much more
detail and involved far fewer officials _ including just the two
old adversaries breaking the ice alone for about 45 minutes.
	   Trimble, who in July was elected ``first minister'' of Northern
Ireland's envisioned cross-community government, had long refused
to speak to Adams' IRA-allied party unless the Irish Republican
Army started disarming.
	   ``The question is when, when will we start to see progress on
that front?'' Trimble said after the meeting, which he called
``encouraging'' and ``civilized.''
	   At a separate press conference minutes earlier, Adams called
their encounter ``only the beginning.''
	   ``Obviously, I have to listen more to David Trimble, and he has
to listen more to me,'' Adams said. ``We have to try and have not
just an understanding of each other's positions, but also to see
how we can marry those positions.''
	   Also Thursday, Northern Ireland's police commander announced
that British army patrols in support of his forces would be
withdrawn this weekend in Belfast. Soldiers, who had been used only
sparingly in recent weeks, would remain deployed in the city's many
fortified barracks as a precaution.
	   Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan said the decision was ``made
possible by the fact that we are continuing to have a significantly
reduced terrorist threat.''
	   However, he said, soldiers would continue to patrol in force
along Northern Ireland's border with the Irish Republic, where the
threat of IRA ambushes has long forced British forces to travel by
helicopter rather than the roads.
	   Trimble's Ulster Unionist Party is the chief representative of
Northern Ireland's British Protestant majority. The IRA began
bombing and shooting in 1970 in hopes of abolishing Northern
Ireland, but called a truce last year to permit Sinn Fein's entry
into multi-party negotiations that reached agreement in April.
	   On Monday, Trimble and Seamus Mallon, a moderate Catholic and
``deputy first minister,'' talked together with all the party
leaders who supported the peace agreement, including Adams.
	   Thursday's session began with Trimble and Mallon jointly meeting
Adams and four other Sinn Fein members. But in a gesture heavily
hyped by Sinn Fein and downplayed by Trimble's aides, the pair went
into another room to talk confidentially.
	   Mallon appealed directly to Adams and Trimble to make ``this
meeting today be the line in the sand beyond which we move ... to
create a new political dispensation.''
	   And in an apparent sideswipe at Trimble's emphasis on IRA
disarmament, Mallon said: ``Let's start making it (the agreement)
work and stop concentrating on issues which may prevent it
working.''
	   After Sinn Fein, Trimble and Mallon jointly met four other party
delegations Thursday: Trimble's Ulster Unionists; Mallon's Social
Democratic and Labor Party, Sinn Fein's larger rival for Catholic
votes; Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists, who condemn Trimble for
considering compromise with Sinn Fein; and the Progressive
Unionists, who represent a pro-British paramilitary group, the
outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force.
	   Each delegation included representatives elected in June to
Northern Ireland's new 108-member legislative Assembly, which will
convene Monday.

Waters rising, but Bangladeshis have no place to flee

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA , Bangladesh (AP) _ With floodwaters threatening to engulf
their homes Thursday, nearly 600,000 Bangladeshis living near the
capital were fearfully looking for havens.
	   Momtaz Ahmed hesitated to take his family to one of the crowded,
potentially dangerous refugee camps that have sprouted up across
the country since the worst flooding in a decade began in July.
	   ``I am trying to leave the area with my family any time today
for a safer place which I have not been able to find yet,'' Ahmed
said.
	   The United Nations, appealing to the world to help Bangladesh
cope with the floods, noted this week that the emergency shelters
were severely overcrowded.
	   ``This overcrowding combined with shortages of food, safe
drinking water and adequate safe sanitation facilities are the
almost perfect breeding ground for major disease outbreak and
public health crisis,'' the U.N. said in a statement.
	   The nearly 600,000 people living near the weakening earthen
embankment that protects the capital Dhaka and the nearby towns of
Narayanganj and Demra were warned Wednesday night to prepare for
evacuation. Soldiers, government workers and area residents had
plugged more than 100 leaks and cracks with sandbags Wednesday.
	   Dhaka Deputy Commissioner Mobarak Ahmed said that 10 new
buildings have been identified by the officials for use as
emergency shelters for women, children and the elderly in Dhaka and
the two adjoining towns.
	   A senior engineer at the Water Development Board, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity, said that if the embankment
collapsed, up to 8 feet (2.5 meters) of water would cover the area.
But he said it would take at least eight hours to reach that
height, giving people time to evacuate.
	   Dhaka's flood Forecasting and Warning Center said Thursday a
2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) stretch of the 35-kilometer (22-mile)
embankment had been further weakened by the overflowing of the
Buriganga and Sitalakhiya rivers.
	   The center said that both the rivers were likely to swell
further under the impact of gushing waters from their upper
reaches.
	   Flood waters have submerged much of this overcrowded delta
nation. The deluge has claimed more than 850 lives and displaced
more than a quarter of the country's 124 million people.
	   The flooding also has increased the spread of waterborne
diseases and destroyed an estimated 2.3 million tons of rice.
	   The British embassy said it would evacuate women and children.
The German and Australian embassies said they were closely
monitoring the situation. The American embassy said it had no plans
to evacuate staff from Dhaka.
	   Most embassies are located in Dhaka's Baridhara and Gulshan
neighborhoods, which are waist-deep in water. Most diplomats ride
boats to go to work.
	   The government has asked for dlrs 889 million in foreign aid and
has so far received pledges totaling dlrs 172 million. Government
officials have stressed that thanks to the response of the
international community, they do not fear a repeat of the famine
that killed 30,000 people following 1974 flooding.
	   Five ships with 100,000 tons of grain reached the southern port
city of Chittagong on Wednesday. Port sources said the food was
purchased by the government and private sources before the flooding
struck when shortages were already predicted in this disaster-prone
country.
	   U.S. embassy officials said Thursday said that planes carrying
American aid _ automatic water purifying units, plastic sheets to
set up emergency shelters and medicines _ were scheduled to reach
Dhaka within a few days.

Israeli planes raid south Lebanon after 4 militiamen killed

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes blasted suspected
guerrilla hideouts in southern Lebanon on Thursday after guerrillas
killed four pro-Israeli militiamen.
	   Earlier, Lebanese anti-aircraft guns opened fire on eight
Israeli jets as they flew low over Beirut, rattling windows as one
fighter broke the sound barrier twice.
	   Witnesses said they saw no sign of the planes being hit.
	   The flight over the Lebanese capital appeared to be an Israeli
show of force after a second roadside bombing in two days killed
members of its South Lebanon Army allies.
	   Two Israeli jets fired a missile each at guerrilla targets
outside the southern town of Mashghara at 2:30 p.m. (1130GMT),
Lebanese security officials said.
	   The jets appeared to be pursuing guerrillas who had detonated a
roadside bomb that killed four members of the Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army about three hours earlier.
	   Black smoke billowed from the area which is over the mountains
from the bombing site outside the town of Jezzine, a town about 40
kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Beirut. There was no word of
casualties from the air strike.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman said warplanes struck
``terrorist targets'' in southern Lebanon. He confirmed reports
from Lebanese security officials that four SLA militiamen were
killed in the bombing.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah group said its guerrillas had
carried out Thursday's attack on a militia vehicle.
	   On Wednesday a Hezbollah bomb killed two militiamen and wounded
five others.
	   Hezbollah is trying to oust 1,500 Israeli troops and 2,500
militiamen from a border zone that Israel has occupied in Lebanon
since 1985 in a bid to protect its northern settlements from
guerrilla attacks.

Report: Taiwanese businessmen murdered in China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A Taiwanese businessman was found stabbed
to death in his factory in eastern China on Thursday, the latest
victim in a growing wave of crime against Taiwanese in China, media
reports in Taiwan said.
	   Cheng Chih-cheng was found tied to a chair in the dormitory of
the curtain factory he owned in the city of Xiamen in coastal
Fujian province, the TVBS television network said.
	   Chinese police have targeted several workers at the factory as
potential suspects, the station said.
	   Cheng's family said they spoke to him Wednesday night, and
learned of his death early Thursday from a member of the factory
staff.
	   Assaults, murders and accidental deaths of Taiwanese businessmen
and visitors in China have risen sharply, and television stations
reported Cheng's death was the 35th such attack this year.
	   The killing of a Taiwanese politician on July 29 in northeastern
China prompted demands in Taiwan for safeguards for Taiwanese in
China.
	   Chan Chi-hung, an official of the Straits Exchange Foundation,
said Cheng's death reinforced the need for talks with China on
setting up a mechanism for dealing with emergencies befalling
Taiwanese in China.
	   The semiofficial foundation is Taiwan's body for handling
exchanges with China.
	   China has recently denied the foundation permission to accompany
victims' family members to China to assist them with arrangements.

	   Earlier Thursday, Lebanese anti-aircraft guns opened fire on
eight Israeli jets as they flew low over Beirut, rattling windows
as one fighter broke the sound barrier twice.
	   Witnesses said they saw no sign of the planes being hit. Air
traffic controllers at Beirut airport said the eight jets flew on
toward the northern port of Tripoli.
	   The flight appeared to be a show of force after the roadside
bombing, the second such attack in two days. On Wednesday, a
similar bomb killed two militiamen and wounded five others.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah group said its guerrillas carried
out Thursday's attack on a militia vehicle.
	   Hezbollah is trying to oust 1,500 Israeli troops and 2,500
militiamen from a border zone that Israel has occupied in Lebanon
since 1985 in a bid to protect its northern settlements from
guerrilla attacks.

Timing of German terror suspect's arrest raises political
</HEADLINE>

	   BERLIN (AP) _ The sudden arrest of a German terror suspect who
was preparing to turn himself in may have been an election-year
move designed to embarrass Germany's leftist Green party and aid
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the suspect's lawyer said.
	   Eberhard Kempf said his client Hans-Joachim Klein _ believed to
be a former accomplice of Cold War terrorist ``Carlos the Jackal''
_ had been negotiating his surrender for months when he was
arrested Tuesday in a cafe in France.
	   ``And with the September 27 (parliamentary) elections just two
weeks away, one starts to wonder,'' Kempf said on German television
Wednesday night.
	   Frankfurt prosecutors denied any political motivation in
arresting Klein, who had been a fugitive for 22 years. Spokesman
Job Tilmann said the hunt for Klein had continued because no
agreement had been made or surrender date set.
	   But with polls showing Kohl's center-right coalition continuing
to trail the Social Democrats and their potential coalition
partner, the Greens, some in Kohl's camp sought to use the arrest
to refocus attention on the radical past of Greens party
parliamentary leader Joschka Fischer.
	   A leader of Kohl's Christian Democrats in Hesse state, Franz
Josef Jung, has demanded Klein be interrogated before the Sept. 27
election to find out whether Fischer told the truth when he denied
links to left-wing terrorism in the 1970s.
	   Fischer was investigated in 1973 after police found some guns
stolen from a U.S. military base in his VW station wagon.
	   At the time, Fischer said he had given the car to Klein to get
the engine fixed and didn't know what he intended to use it for.
	   One of the stolen guns was later used in 1982 in the
still-unsolved murder of the Hesse state economics minister. It was
never clear if the murder weapon had been in Fischer's car.
	   Federal and state prosecutors said they had no evidence to link
Fischer to the killing.
	   ``Till now we only have Fischer's version about this event. Now
we want to know what Klein has to say about it,'' Jung said.
	   A spokeswoman for Fischer in Bonn declined to comment. ``That's
an old story and the facts are known,'' she said. ``All has already
been said.''
	   German officials said Thursday they would give French
authorities an extradition request for Klein in a week or two.

South Korea says it will spur rocket development
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SANG-HUN CHOE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Stung by rival North Korea's recent
launch of a missile, South Korea will speed up work on its own
rocket technology, officials said Thursday.
	   South Korea's initial plans were to put a satellite in orbit by
a domestically developed rocket by 2010.
	   South Korea now has four satellite orbiting the Earth, but all
of them were launched aboard foreign rockets.
	   On Thursday, officials said the government was advancing the
schedule by five years.
	   ``After the North Korean launch, we feel a public opinion
growing that we should put a spur on our space projects,'' said
Yoon Hun-joo, an official at the Science and Technology Ministry.
	   On Aug. 31, North Korea launched what it calls its first
scientific satellite.
	   U.S. and Japanese defense officials believe the launch was the
test-firing of a ballistic missile that sailed over northern Japan
and crashed into the Pacific Ocean.
	   Whether a missile or satellite, it showed a worrisome increase
in North Korea's missile capability.
	   North Korea's new Taepo Dong 1 missile is believed to have an
estimated range of 2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles), enough to hit
any targets in South Korea and Japan.
	   South Korean media have since lamented what they called a
10-year gap in space technology between the two Koreas.
	   Yoon said his ministry was putting together a task force of
scientists to advance key technological developments needed to
build rockets and satellites.
	   Also Thursday, South Korean officials reiterated their demand
that Washington allow the country to develop missiles with longer
ranges.
	   South Korea is bound not to develop a missile with a range
longer than 180 kilometers (112 miles) under its 1979 agreement
with the United States.
	   The country hopes to develop a missile with a range of up to 300
kilometers (187 miles), a limit set by the Missile Technology
Control Regime.
	   In October last year, South Korea successfully test-fired its
first locally developed guided missile with a range of only 10
kilometers (6 miles).
	   South Korea is technically at war with North Korea, with no
peace treaty signed at the end of a three-year war in the early
1950s.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Peru's President Alberto Fujimori agreed
Thursday to work with Polish counterpart Aleksander Kwasniewski
toward expanded trade and tourism between their two countries, in
the first visit to Poland by a Peruvian head of state.
	   The two presidents, meeting at the start of Fujimori's four-day
trip, also discussed international cooperation to combat organized
crime and drug trafficking.
	   Peruvian and Polish officials plan to sign a treaty on avoiding
double taxation, protecting investments and expanding tourist
exchanges. The two presidents will host a Polish-Peruvian economic
forum on Friday.
	   Fujimori told a news conference that he appreciated Poland's
evolution from a communist system to a free-market democracy, and
said that it shares Peru's desire for rapid growth.
	   The Peruvian president, accompanied by his foreign, social and
economic affairs ministers, also was scheduled to meet with Prime
Minister Jerzy Buzek and parliamentary leaders.
	   Fujimori is to visit the former Nazi death camp of Auschwitz on
Saturday.
	   Fujimori said a Polish economic delegation was expected in the
Peruvian capital of Lima in November, and that he invited
Kwasniewski to visit Peru.

Army: 3 Pakistanis killed, 1 arrested in Indian-held Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Three Pakistanis who slipped across
India's border to join a Muslim insurrection in Indian-held Kashmir
were killed by soldiers, the army said Thursday.
	   India repeatedly accuses the Pakistani government of fomenting
violence in the only Muslim-majority state in this predominately
Hindu country. Islamic Pakistan says it gives only moral support to
anti-Indian militants in Kashmir.
	   On Thursday, Brig. N.S. Rana also presented to reporters in
Srinagar a man he said was a fourth Pakistani militant captured in
the operation a day before.
	   Rana said soldiers had received a tip that the Pakistanis and
three Indian comrades were hiding in a house in Nagham, 110
kilometers (70 miles) north of Srinagar, summer capital of
Indian-held Kashmir.
	   In a joint operation, army and border security forces surrounded
the house. One Pakistani and three Indians surrendered, but when
the other three refused to come out, the soldiers fired 16 rockets
at the house, destroying it and killing its three occupants, Rana
said.
	   Since 1989, Kashmir has been aflame in secessionist violence
that has killed more than 16,000 people.

UN: Vietnam's fight against poverty may be stymied by crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Progress in fighting poverty in Vietnam
could be hurt by the Asian economic crisis, the United Nations
Development Program said Thursday.
	   UNDP senior economist Robert Glofcheski said he expects the
construction, industry, tourism and services sector to be
especially hard hit.
	   Economic growth is expected to come in at 5.5 percent in 1998,
down from 8.8 percent in 1997.
	   He said farmers could benefit if they are allowed to share in
the profits from Vietnam's increasing rice exports but so far this
has not been the case.
	   Vietnam is the second largest rice exporter in the world after
Thailand and sold more than 3.5 million tons of rice in 1997.
	   However, exports are handled by two state-run monopolies and
economists have said farm incomes would rise in rice exporting
regions if the private sector was allowed to export rice.
	   Some 80 percent of Vietnam's population lives in rural areas and
most of the people there are involved in rice farming.
	   Glofcheski noted that some 50 percent of Vietnam's more than 78
million population live under the poverty line, according to a 1993
survey.
	   This was sharply lower than the 75 percent living under the
poverty line before Vietnam began restructuring its economy in the
mid 1980s.
	   The Vietnamese government's poverty threshold is lower.
According to its standards, Vietnam has only 20 percent of its
population below the poverty line and only 5 percent without enough
food to eat.
	   Glofcheski was speaking at a news conference to launch the
UNDP's Human Development Report which ranked Vietnam 122 out of 174
countries in terms of a Human Development Index.
	   The index measures life expectancy, literacy and the ability to
buy goods and services.
	   The report suggested that although the country is poor, it is
still spending an appreciable amount of money on health care and
education.

Top Iraqi Kurd warns of Turks' creating a new Cyprus in Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes from Turkey's deputy prime minister grafs 7-8 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Turkey's military intervention in northern
Iraq could lead to a Cyprus-style occupation, the Iraqi Kurdish
leader Jalal Talabani warned in remarks published Thursday.
	   The Turkish presence is ``dangerous, in our opinion, and it
threatens Iraqi sovereignty and national unity,'' Talabani told the
London-based, Arabic-language newspaper Al-Hayat.
	   Turkey has apparently maintained several thousand troops in
northern Iraq since May 1997 in a bid to prevent Turkish Kurd
insurgents from crossing into its territory. The Ankara government
refuses to confirm a permanent force in Iraq, saying only that
troops cross into the country whenever necessary.
	   ``We fear that this could be a pretext to create a new Cyprus in
this region,'' said Talabani, who leads the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan. Turkey has occupied the northern third of Cyprus since
1974 when it invaded the island after a coup by supporters of union
with Greece.
	   Talabani was speaking in Iran before heading to Washington for
talks with U.S. officials and his rival, Massoud Barzani of the
Kurdistan Democratic Party.
	   In the past, Talabani's PUK has fought against Turkish forces
carrying out incursions in northern Iraq whereas Barzani's KDP has
supported the Turks.
	   In Turkey on Thursday, Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit
accused Talabani of helping the Turkish Kurdish insurgents to flee
from Iraq into Iran from where they can relaunch their operations.
	   ``Since our cooperation with Barzani, it has become more and
more difficult (for the insurgents) to infiltrate (into Turkey)
from Iraq. Therefore, with the help of Talabani, they are crossing
into Iran,'' Ecevit told the private Turkish television channel,
NTV.
	   Talabani accused Turkey of using its ``Turkmen brothers'' _
Iraqis of Turkish origin _ as a pretext for entering northern Iraq,
whose population is mostly Kurd.
	   ``The Turkmen number several hundreds of thousands while Turkey
claims that they number three to four million.''
	   Talabani's talks in Washington are expected to deal with ways of
consolidating a cease fire brokered by the United States in May
1997. The PUK and KDP have wrestled for control of the Kurdish
autonomous zone in northern Iraq since the Western allies set it up
in 1991 after Iraqi government forces severely crushed a Kurdish
revolt.

Branson teams with archrival for balloon trip
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Virgin boss Richard Branson said Thursday that he
has joined forces with archrival Steve Fossett for another shot at
piloting a hot air balloon around the world.
	   Branson, the flamboyant tycoon whose Virgin company name adorns
everything from record stores and clothing to an airline, has
failed to accomplish the feat in four tries.
	   Fossett's latest attempt ended last month in a 29,000-foot
(8,800-meter) plunge into the Coral Sea.
	   The two men, along with Swedish balloonist Pers Lindstrand, plan
to take off in November in the Virgin Global Challenger. For the
first time, they will have a backup balloon in case of damage,
which has halted so many attempts in the past.
	   Branson's previous attempts have been hampered by weather, and
the only time he managed to take off _ in January 1997 _ his
balloon crash-landed in the Algerian desert.
	   ``We have learned from our own mistakes and other people's
mistakes,'' he said. ``We just hope that we get better luck this
year than we have had for the past four years.''
	   Fossett, a Chicago entrepreneur, said he was still on the rescue
boat after his crash landing last month when Branson called to
suggest the partnership.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ At the end of one cul-de-sac in a
posh Kuala Lumpur suburb, the growing crowds chanting
``Reformasi!'' have become a national spectacle.
	   At first hundreds, now thousands have descended on the home of
ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim every night since his
dismissal last week, some to support his reform campaign _ many
just to witness the show.
	   ``I came to see the fiesta,'' said Cheng Poh Hand, a corporate
lawyer, seated beneath a blue-and-white striped tent top on a
leather couch, doubling as lawn furniture on Anwar's back porch.
	   Anwar was sacked as finance and deputy prime minister and
expelled from the ruling party on lurid allegations ranging from
sexual misconduct with men and women to treason.
	   Since then he has held nightly rallies, often preaching barefoot
atop a coffee table, asserting his innocence and outlining his
campaign for political reform.
	   Anwar's residence, a spacious, white-stucco duplex, has been
transformed into a political command post where he mingles with
supporters _ many equipped with instamatic cameras to pose with the
fallen leader _ and journalists, staked out round-the-clock,
listening for police sirens.
	   For days, Anwar has said he fears his imminent arrest. But Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Thursday that police would avoid
arresting Anwar to prevent international media from labeling
Malaysia as ``repressive.''
	   Unable to read about Anwar's speeches in the pro-government
local press, Malaysians, many of whom traveled to Kuala Lumpur from
other states in country, have converged on Anwar's home to hear his
story firsthand.
	   University students distribute photocopies of foreign news
articles downloaded from the Internet to the crowd mixed with
political supporters, middle-class businessmen and housewives
clutching their children's hands.
	   ``Most of them, they want to hear his speech, what he has to
say,'' said Azman Ali Mohamad, a financial consultant, gesturing at
the more than 6,000 people spilling into the upscale neighborhood
around Anwar's home during a recent speech. ``I came to see him,
his house _ and all this.''
	   Mercedes and motorbikes jammed the usually quiet streets,
prowling for parking spots. Unable to enter Anwar's tightly-packed
backyard, onlookers crouched on the high stucco walls surrounding
his home. Others, craning their necks to see, held tape recorders
or video cameras in Anwar's general direction.
	   Vendors outside hawked bottled water with a sign that read:
``Reformation Water'' and bootlegged cassettes and videotapes of
Anwar's fiery speeches from the past week. One vendor estimated he
had sold 5,000 cassettes in four days.
	   The Domino's Pizza around the corner extended business hours
from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m. to feed the massive flow of customers.
	   To secure a good seat, onlookers have taken to arriving several
hours early and making themselves at home on Anwar's living room
couches or on plastic chairs lining his torn-up lawn.
	   A cluster of men on a recent afternoon sat in the backyard
watching a professional wrestling match on a giant-screen TV set up
to view back videotapes of Anwar's speeches.

Irish inflation hits 6-year high
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Irish inflation climbed to a six-year
high of 3.2 percent in August, the government statistics office
said Thursday.
	   The figures represented an 0.5 percent jump from July.
	   The Irish are paying more money for housing and imports from
Britain, and falling interest rates are adding inflationary
pressures to the economy.
	   The Irish punt has fallen in value by 15 percent this year
versus its traditional sister currency, the British pound. That
directly reflects the Dublin government's decision to take part in
European monetary union while Britain and Northern Ireland stay
out.
	   In other data released Thursday, residential property values in
the Irish Republic have risen by 19 percent since January _ and by
26 percent in the capital of Dublin.
	   And the inflation picture looks likely to worsen. Economists
expect Irish interest rates to fall about 2 percentage points more
in coming months as Ireland's monetary policy draws closer to that
of other European nations joining the single currency.

were tied another stroke back at 69 for third place along with
Carlos Franco of Paraguay and seven others.
	   Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki, Japan's winningest golfer with 108
victories, fired a 70 for an eight-way tie for 13th.
	   Defending champion Hiroyuki Fujita carded a 71 and was in a
group of 15 sharing 21st.

Elway won't totally rule out playing in '99
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN MOSSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ John Elway agonized for four months over whether
to return for the 1998 season. Now he's actually giving
consideration to playing next year as well.
	   Elway, who earlier this year ruled out playing beyond this
season, is leaving the door open _ if only slightly _ for 1999.
	   After finally winning a Super Bowl ring last January, Elway
announced on June 1 he would play another season and said he was
99.9 percent certain it would be his last. When a reporter asked
him if that meant there was still a chance of his playing beyond
1998, he amended it to 100 percent to avoid persistent speculation.
	   But in an interview with ESPN's Jim Kelly, aired on Sunday,
Elway said if this season, his 16th, goes as well as he hopes and
he remains healthy, he would consider returning for 1999. However,
he called that likelihood a longshot.
	   ``Chances are I'm not coming back,'' Elway said after Monday
night's 27-21 victory over New England. ``But I haven't totally
ruled it out. If I throw for 4,000 yards and 40 touchdowns and we
win the Super Bowl ... ''
	   Asked if he was prepared for the inevitable questions about
1999, the 38-year-old Elway said, ``I'm not going to answer those.
I'm going to wait 'til the end of the year, and we'll go from
there. I'm here and I want to talk about this year and what's going
to happen this year.''
	   Broncos coach Mike Shanahan, whose team plays host to the Dallas
Cowboys on Sunday, said Tuesday night he doesn't know what Elway
will do, ``and I don't think John knows what he wants to do. I
think he just wants to enjoy the moment. He doesn't want to make a
commitment right now. I don't think he wants to put himself in a
situation where he says he's definitely going to retire.
	   ``I know he's having fun and he's enjoying the game. That might
change when he takes a few hits.''
	   Elway completed 22 of 34 passes for 257 yards and a touchdown in
the win over New England. Looking friskier than in recent years, he
repeatedly scrambled to make big plays downfield, and even made a
head-first dive for a 13-yard gain to keep a drive alive.
	   ``He was energized,'' Broncos wide receiver Ed McCaffrey said.
``The guy is amazing. He's in better shape than ever, and he's
making plays like he's 21 years old.''
	   Added tight end Shannon Sharpe, ``Did he look 38? No way. We put
the game on his shoulders, and John Elway did the rest.''
	   Patriots coach Pete Carroll said Elway ``was all over the place.
He made stuff happen. Forget how old he is.''
	   Like most of his teammates, Broncos running back Terrell Davis
was taking a wait-and-see attitude about the possibility that Elway
might play next season.
	   ``Let's just play this year out and when the offseason comes,
let's talk him into another year,'' Davis said.

Kabila: Congo is ready for a `long-haul' war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congo is preparing for a ``long-haul
war'' against anti-government rebels and will launch further
offensives in the east of the country, President Laurent Kabila
said Thursday.
	   The offensive ``is being prepared and it continues,'' Kabila
said on state radio.
	   Hi1|rmies have backed Kabila.
Congo also sent its defense minister.
	   The defense ministers of Uganda and Rwanda were also expected.
	   The meeting in Ethiopia comes just two days after a round of
peace talks, held in Zimbabwe and attended by seven African
presidents, failed after Kabila refused to meet the rebels.
Fighting then surged in eastern Congo.
	   Rebel-run Radio Bukavu said insurgents and government-backed
militiamen clashed near Bukavu, a lakeside town on the border with
Rwanda.
	   Refugees fleeing across Lake Tanganyika to Tanzania told U.N.
workers that the government recaptured the southeastern town of
Kalemie on Wednesday.
	   Neither report could be confirmed independently.
	   In his Thursday broadcast, Kabila also reiterated his accusation
that Rwanda and Uganda were the real force behind the rebellion,
saying they want to ``unseat the government of the Democratic
Republic of Congo because it is more popular and more powerful.''
	   Both countries deny they are supporting the rebels.
	   In Kinshasa, where electricity was returned to much of the city
Wednesday night after weeks of darkness, the government has ordered
the arrest of about a dozen gas station owners, saying they had
been selling fuel to black market speculators instead of to the
general public.
	   The cost of fuel, food and water shot up in Kinshasa as the
rebels approached the city.
	   On Wednesday, Belgian officials warning of a potential
humanitarian crisis said they were ready to airlift 700 tons of
food donated by the U.N. food agency to the capital.
	   However, with the power back on and at least one commercial
airline _ the Belgian company Sabena SA _ resuming service to
Kinshasa, it appeared that crisis may have been averted.
	   The rebels accuse Kabila of corruption, nepotism and fostering
ethnic divisiveness.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A skinny boy, Isam Ilwi strains to pull a
water cart on rickety wheels along the narrow lane. At 12, Isam is
earning his living in a pottery workshop.
	   Rasha, 8, sits atop a mountain of garbage, her hands and feet
scratched from broken glass as she seeks out plastic yogurt
containers for recycling. Hanan Mukhtar, at 10 a nanny and maid,
works in more rarefied surroundings. She watches over Seif _ who is
half her age _ clumsily riding his bike at the posh Gezira Club.
	   ``Work is hard, but there's no choice. We need the money,''
Hanan says. The most difficult part is living away from home, she
confesses, her eyes filling with tears.
	   This is the childhood lived by two million Egyptian youngsters,
many of whom do far dirtier or more dangerous work.
	   Human rights groups regularly condemn such practices and demand
an outright ban on child labor. And Western countries _ where
incomes are larger and families smaller _ impose sanctions on
companies to try stop the hiring of children.
	   But social and economic realities beg for a more sympathetic
understanding of child labor in poor countries like Egypt, where
children have always been part of the work force.
	   Experts say that banning child labor and imposing sanctions on
factories could have even more heartbreaking results _ throwing
children into mean streets or taking away the meager earnings that
feed them and their families.
	   ``Who are you punishing when you impose sanctions on child
labor?'' asks Adel Azer, a U.N. consultant. ``We don't want to make
life more difficult for these people.''
	   That's a view shared by many, including officials at the
Ministry of Social Affairs who admit that despite a law that bans
children under 15 from working, they are helpless to stop it.
	   ``Poor families have no choice and are forced to send their
children to work.... No one has any control over this,'' said Anwar
el-Sherif, deputy minister of social affairs.
	   The picture is repeated throughout the Middle East, from poor
countries like Yemen to oil-rich ones like Saudi Arabia. Poverty
and political turmoil force children into the most menial jobs or
into begging on the streets.
	   In Iran, young girls with tiny fingers work in carpet workshops,
often family enterprises. In the Gulf states of Oman, the United
Arab Emirates and Qatar, camel jockeys as young as 5 take part in
weekend camel races.
	   But Egypt, with six million of its 63 million people living
below the poverty line, is where the problem of child labor stands
out most starkly.
	   ---
	   Sabah Abdelwahab, 30, crouches on the floor holding her head in
one hand as she explains why she sent her son Osama to work five
years ago _ at age 8 _ after her husband left her to marry another
woman.
	   ``What can we do? He's a help. His father doesn't give us
anything. Who's going to help?'' she asks, smiling nervously.
	   Osama says he gets dizzy spells since he was hit by a car last
year. Still he works for 15 pounds (dlrs 4.50) a week at an auto
repair shop, from 9 a.m. to 10 at night, to help feed his two
younger sisters and smaller brother.
	   His mother brings in about 20 pounds (dlrs 5.80) a week baking
bread for the neighbors. A big mud oven for the baking takes up
most of one of the family's two rooms. A tiny kerosene burner is
used for cooking.
	   They pay five pounds (dlrs 1.4) a month for their lodging, which
is infested with flies and littered with garbage. The whole family
sleeps in one big bed.
	   Osama's dream is to go to school, but he sees no point in
dreaming. ``There's no money,'' he says.
	   What keeps him going is his day off on Friday _ when he plays
soccer with neighborhood children _ and the hope that his brothers
and sisters may go to school.
	   ``I feel responsible for the family. They are still young and
have to be taken care of,'' he says, rubbing his hands stained with
black motor grease.
	   ---
	   Isam Ilwi _ the potter's helper _ wants an education, too.
	   But his academic history offers little hope: his father sent him
to work in Cairo after he failed in school three years in a row. He
lives with his young uncle in a small room near the pottery
workshop.
	   He says he misses his family in Fayoum, about 100 kilometers (60
miles) from Cairo. He complains his work is too hard, the load is
too heavy and his body aches.
	   He would have liked to become a school teacher and has a simply
answer when asked why he would choose teaching.
	   ``A comfortable life,'' he says.
	   ---
	   Hanan Mukhtar, the maid and nanny to Seif, seems luckier than
some of the other young workers. She wears a clean blue shirt, long
skirt and gold earrings.
	   But her small, severe face looks sad.

Minister: top Italian fugitive Licio Gelli arrested
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: ADDS time of arrest, other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian and French police Thursday captured one of
Italy's leading fugitives, financier Licio Gelli, who had been
convicted in a huge banking scandal, Italy's interior minister
announced Thursday.
	   RAI state TV said Gelli was wearing a false beard and carrying
false documents when he was arrested in Cannes, a French resort
near the Italian border. The 79-year-old financier was in the
company of his son, the report said.
	   Napolitano told RAI it was ``premature'' to say when Gelli might
be extradited to Italy.
	   Gelli was under house arrest in his Tuscan mansion when he
disappeared in May. In April, Italy's highest court upheld his
conviction on charges of complicity in the 1982 fraudulent
bankruptcy of the Milan-based Banco Ambrosiano, once Italy's
largest private bank, and sentenced him to 12 years and eight
months in prison.
	   It was Italy's largest post-war banking scandal. The collapse
followed the bank's failure to collect dlrs 1.3 billion in loans
made to dummy companies in Latin America.

Salomon appointed as financial adviser
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's prime minister on
Thursday appointed a major U.S. investment bank, Salomon Smith
Barney, to find ways to raise funds for the country's troubled
banking sector.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said the U.S. financial giant, a
unit of Traveler's Group, will become the adviser to Danamodal, a
new government agency that is trying to pour in fresh funds for
cash-strapped banks.
	   The amount of cash needed hasn't been decided yet, Mahathir
said.
	   ``We expect to have a fund-raising program as soon as
possible,'' said Deryck Maughan, co-chairman and CEO of Salomon
Smith Barney. ``We have a volatile capital market, and we need them
to settle down.''
	   Funding for such projects has nearly evaporated. Malaysia
recently ditched a plan to issue bonds worth dlrs 2 billion bonds
after international ratings agencies slashed Malaysia's foreign
exchange ratings to just above junk status.
	   The central bank said Wednesday that about 9.4 billion ringgit
(dlrs 2.5 billion) has to be pumped into several local banks over
the next two to six weeks.
	   Since the Asian currency turmoil swept through Malaysia last
July, the country's banking sector have been lumbered with soaring
bad debt accrued by hemorrhaging companies. This has made banks
extremely cautious of approving new loans.
	   On Thursday, the central bank said it was forcing commercial
banks to extend new loans at a rate of at least 8 percent each year
to try and get the depressed economy growing again.
	   ``If banks don't lend, they're not doing their duty as
bankers,'' Mahathir told reporters.

Oil slick threatens marine life on Emirates' east coast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ An oil slick was threatening
marine life off the coast of the Emirates on Thursday.
	   The slick, which has polluted some 8 kilometers (5 miles) of
seashore in the emirate of Fujairah, was caused by oil tankers
washing out their tanks, the Gulf News quoted fishermen as saying.
	   An official at Fujairah's municipality confirmed that a slick
was threatening marine life, but he said his department had
inadequate resources to deal with the pollution.
	   Earlier this year, a barge ran aground and spilled 4,000 tons
(28,000 barrels) of fuel oil off the northern emirate of Umm Al
Quwain, killing millions of fish larvae and destroying thousands of
mangrove trees.

New faces in new places as Serie A gets underway
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC;

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Now the fun starts.
	   The great Udinese-comes-to-Milan experiment begins in earnest,
Christian Vieri and Marcelo Salas team up at Lazio of Rome,
Giovanni Trapattoni returns to Italy, Juventus of Turin bids for a
third straight title.
	   After an offseason fraught with doping investigations, upheaval
in the national team and some major roster makeovers, the Italian
League opens the 1998-99 season with five games Saturday and four
Sunday.
	   There will be plenty of new faces in new places, including coach
Alberto Zaccheroni, German striker Oliver Bierhoff and Danish
midfielder Thomas Helveg, who all moved from Udinese to AC Milan,
which hosts Bologna Saturday night.
	   Saturday's other games, pushed up a day to give clubs an extra
day of rest and preparation ahead of their UEFA Cup debuts Tuesday,
are Fiorentina vs. Empoli, AC Parma vs. Vicenza, AS Roma vs.
Salernitana, and Udinese vs. Sampdoria of Genoa.
	   Games Sunday are Bari vs. Venezia, Cagliari vs. Internazionale
of Milan, Perugia vs. Juventus, and Piacenza vs. Lazio .
	   The last time Milan played a league game at home, a 1-1 draw
with Parma last season, its fans blocked the bus taking Milan
players to the stadium and then forced an eight-minute suspension
of the match by throwing bottles and vegetables onto the field.
	   Milan was once Italy's proudest club, dominating on the domestic
and international stages. But such success is often cyclical, and
the franchise's four titles in five years early in the decade seem
a distant memory.
	   Media magnate and former Premier Silvio Berlusconi's team will
be missing out on European cup play for the second straight season
and Zaccheroni and Co. were brought in to try to turn things
around.
	   But if a 2-0 loss to second-division Torino this week in Italian
Cup play is any indication, the rebuilding could be painful.
	   ``We didn't have our heads or our legs in the game. Not one of
us was fully on the field,'' said striker Maurizio Ganz, who'll
line up with Bierhoff and Liberian striker George Weah in attack
Saturday. ``It was a bad game for everyone. But now we have to
concentrate on Bologna. And we can't have any fear.''
	   Bierhoff is perhaps Zaccheroni's biggest supporter.
	   ``We just need to be patient,'' said the German, who led Serie A
with 27 goals last season. ``Zaccheroni did well at Udinese. He
certainly will not fail at Milan.''
	   Making things tougher at San Siro Stadium are the
disqualifications _ carried over from last season _ of veteran
defender Alessandro Costacurta and midfielder Massimo Ambrosini.
And captain Paolo Maldini (leg muscle injury) is not at 100
percent.
	   Trapattoni will get his first taste of Serie A soccer since he
was forced out at Cagliari two years ago. After a stormy second
stint in Germany's Bundesliga, the former Juventus and Inter coach
is back with rebuilt Fiorentina. The team's regional derby against
Empoli will see the often-conservative Trapattoni unleash a potent
South American attack trio of Gabriel Batistuta, Edmundo and Luis
Oliviera.
	   Three of the new clubs in Serie A open with tough games against
title contenders. Perugia faces Juventus and last season's top
striker duo of Alessandro Del Piero and Filippo Inzaghi; Cagliari
goes up against Inter Milan and its own star duo of Ronaldo and
Roberto Baggio; while Salernitana and rising star Marco Di Vaio, a
native of Rome, take on AS Roma at Olympic Stadium.

Iran schedules more military exercises near Afghan border
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran said Thursday it will hold a second set
of military exercises on its border with Afghanistan as rhetoric
over diplomats missing in the neighboring country heated up.
	   Maj. Gen. Ali Shahbazi, Iran's army chief of staff, said new
maneuvers would be held, but he did not give a starting date.
	   Some 70,000 elite Iranian soldiers _ backed by tanks and
helicopter gun ships _ held three days of maneuvers near the border
earlier this month in a show of strength against Afghanistan.
	   Iran accuses the Taliban militia, which controls most of
Afghanistan, of holding some 70 Iranians, including 11 diplomats.
	   The new exercises will be ``unprecedented in terms of scope and
variety of operations'' and will include artillery units and
armored units, Shahbazi said.
	   He added that the maneuvers, code named Zolfaqar, were
``inevitable, considering the increased security disturbances on
our eastern borders.''
	   Earlier this week, the U.S. State Department expressed concern
about rising tensions between Iran and Afghanistan and urged both
sides to exercise restraint.
	   The statement came after U.S. intelligence officials warned that
the Iran had not moved its troops after the first set of maneuvers
and appeared poised to invade.
	   The U.N. Security Council has called for Afghanistan to give the
Iranians safe passage out of the country.
	   Anger has been rising in Tehran since Aug. 8, when the Taliban
militia overran the city of Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan
and the 11 Iranian diplomats and a journalist went missing.
	   The Iranians later said that a number of Iranian drivers also
were being held by the Taliban.
	   On Thursday, Iranian radio said that the leader of the Taliban _
Mullah Mohammed Omar _ personally ordered his forces to detain the
Iranian diplomats and the journalist.
	   It said that Omar ordered 15 armed men to enter the Iranian
consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif to take them as ``hostages.''
	   The agency quoted ``informed sources'' that were not otherwise
identified.
	   The Taliban, which accused the Iranians of aiding opposition
forces, denies any knowledge of the diplomats. Last Thursday, it
freed five Iranian prisoners in a goodwill gesture.
	   Meanwhile, Ghorbanali Dorri Najafabadi, Iran's intelligence
minister, said he had information that Taliban forces had entered
the consulate with the help of Pakistani intelligence forces.
	   He repeated Iran's earlier assertion that it ``will use any
means to save the diplomats' lives.''
	   Pakistan is seen as a major backer of the Taliban, while Iran
has supported the Afghan opposition forces.

Keiko, the movie star whale, comes home

<TEXT>
	   HEIMAEY, Iceland (AP) _ In a Hollywood-style finish, ``Free
Willy'' star Keiko returned home to the waters of Iceland on
Thursday after 19 years in captivity and a career as a movie star.
	   Hundreds of excited children welcomed the world's most famous
killer whale to town after the U.S. Air Force cargo plane landed on
this windswept archipelago following an eight-hour flight from
Oregon.
	   Keiko's handlers hope his return to Iceland will lead to his
transformation from an aquarium performing animal and movie star to
an animal of the wild again.
	   ``He's fine. It was an absolutely smooth trip. The staff is
euphoric!'' said Diane Hammond, spokeswoman for the Free Willy
Keiko Foundation, which owns the whale and is orchestrating his
homecoming.
	   ``For the children of the world, this is a wonderful event and
these airflifters showed that they can take anything anyplace
anytime,'' said Air Force Secretary F. Whitten Peters. He said the
Air Force was proud the mission went so smoothly.
	   The huge plane appeared to land normally in stiff headwinds at
Heimaey's airport, but there was a small problem.
	   ``A piece of the right landing gear failed as the plane
landed,'' said U.S. Air Force spokeswoman Capt. Maria Karl. ``But
the landing itself was very smooth.''
	   A couple of hundred curious townsfolk dotted the landscape as
Keiko's holding tank was maneuvered from the plane to the waiting
flatbed truck with its ``Welcome Home Willy'' banner.
	   The truck with its famous passenger drove into the small town
past throngs of children waving little Icelandic and American flags
and welcoming him with ``velkommen keiko'' banners.
	   Some of the youngsters ran alongside the slowly moving truck
under crystal blue skies on a brisk late summer day.
	   Keiko will be loaded onto a barge and taken to a sea pen _ the
size of a football field _ in a protected cove.
	   There he will be reintroduced to the sights and sounds of the
waters where he was captured as a 2-year-old. He will live in his
pen, off the rugged Westmann Islands, until his handlers determine
he is able to live on his own.
	   Keiko began his step toward freedom on Wednesday when he swam
into a holding tank, shimmied into a nylon stretcher and calmly
chirped as he was hoisted out of his home at the Oregon Coast
Aquarium.
	   Bidding the whale goodbye was tough for the children who fell in
love with Keiko after watching his movies and seeing him in his
spacious pool over the past 2 1/2 years.
	   Hundreds of people, some with signs reading ``Keiko, we love
you'' and ``We will miss you,'' lined the highway as a truck
carried the whale to the airport.
	   Keiko's bid for freedom has its roots in Hollywood and the hopes
of children around the world.
	   In the 1993 box-office hit ``Free Willy,'' about an orca
threatened by a villainous amusement park owner, the whale played
by Keiko leaps over a breakwall to freedom in the open ocean.
	   Real life wasn't so tidy. It was learned that Keiko was
languishing in a cramped Mexico City tank.
	   School kids collected pennies to help save Keiko. Warner Bros.
and cell-phone billionaire Craig McCaw kicked in millions more to
bring the whale to the Oregon tank to recuperate from lung
infections and warty lesions, all with the aim of setting him free.
	   Trying to transform a long-captive whale back into a wild
predator has never been tried before, and whale handlers at
aquariums have criticized Keiko's move.
	   Critics say Keiko isn't skilled enough at catching fish, has no
experience of other orcas and could be shocked by the frigid, harsh
conditions of the North Atlantic.
	   Even Keiko's most enthusiastic handlers say it will be at least
two years before they can determine if he can survive in the open
ocean. And they concede he may have spend the rest of his life _ 10
years or more _ in the pen.

Arafat adviser: monopolies to be phased out by late 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Palestinian Authority will phase out its
monopoly on gas and cement by the end of 1999, said the senior
economic adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   The Palestinian Authority made the decision after talks with the
World Bank and foreign donor countries which have pushed for
greater economic openness, said the adviser, Mohammed Rashid.
	   ``We had to have those monopolies during this period of time,''
Rashid said Wednesday during a lecture on the fifth anniversary of
the peace agreements with Israel. He did not elaborate.
	   A Palestinian watchdog group said in a report last year that top
Palestinian officials used their positions to establish monopolies
for personal gain.
	   The report said contractors working on the Palestinian airport
in the Gaza Strip were forced to buy cement from Israel rather than
from a cheaper source in Egypt. The pressure came from officials
who stood to gain a commission, the report said.
	   There has been speculation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip that
the Palestinian Authority is also restricting competition in other
areas or awarding sought-after distributorships to top officials
and their relatives.
	   Rashid denied this Wednesday. ``I challenge any one who says
that the authority has any other monopolies,'' Rashid said.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A former executive of a major Japanese electronics
maker and three other officials were arrested Thursday on charges
of breach of trust in a widening scandal ensnaring military
officials and contractors.
	   Arrested by Tokyo prosecutors was Tatsumi Nagatoshi, a former
executive at NEC Corp., who is suspected of arranging a contract
that overcharged the government for military equipment.
	   The three others arrested were Hiroshi Nagasawa, an NEC manager,
and Toyo Communication Equipment Co. executives Shuichi Isobe and
Kozo Honda, prosecutors said.
	   Prosecutors refused to give further details. But the defense
officials are suspected of going along with the deal in exchange
for private-sector jobs after retirement.
	   NEC denied involvement in the scandal.
	   ``We have nothing to say other than it is very regrettable,''
NEC spokesman Masakatsu Miwa told reporters.
	   Miwa also defended his firm's practice of hiring former Defense
Agency officials and added the company will continue to do so.
	   ``Such people are necessary for our business for advice
requiring specialized knowledge,'' Miwa said, adding that about 30
former agency officials are now working at NEC.
	   NEC has signed contracts valued at 74.5 billion yen (dlrs 544
million) from the Defense Agency for fiscal 1997 ending in April
this year. NEC is the fourth largest contractor with the agency.
	   Kyodo News Agency reported that Nagatoshi met with Kenichi Ueno,
then deputy director of the procurement department at the Defense
Agency, shortly after the overcharging problem surfaced in February
1994.
	   Ueno was arrested last Thursday, along with three executives of
Toyo Communication Equipment Co., which is 38.96 percent owned by
NEC.
	   Toyo Communications had been ordered to repay 2.5 billion yen
(dlrs 18.2 million) to the government for having sold overpriced
equipment over a five-year period.
	   But it was forced to return only 874 million yen (dlrs 6.4
million). Ueno is suspected of reducing Toyo's reimbursement to the
government.
	   Nagatoshi, the executive arrested Thursday, became president of
Japan Aviation Electronic Industry, a firm 50.2 percent owned by
NEC, three years ago.
	   The maximum penalty for breach of trust upon conviction is five
years in prison.

<TEXT>
	   Major events in Russia's financial and political crisis:
	   Monday, Aug. 17 _ After months of financial pressure, the
government effectively devalues the ruble and defaults on its first
debt payments.
	   Sunday, Aug. 23 _ President Boris Yeltsin fires Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko and reinstates the prime minister he fired five
months earlier, Viktor Chernomyrdin.
	   Monday, Aug. 24 _ Yeltsin explains his decision by saying Russia
needs a ``heavyweight'' in this time of crisis. Reformer Boris
Nemtsov quits as first deputy prime minister. Value of the ruble
falls from 6.29 to 7.14 to the dollar.
	   Tuesday, Aug. 25 _ Ruble falls 9.2 percent to close at 7.86, its
biggest one-day plunge in nearly four years. Currency trading
suspended twice when banks overwhelmed by demand for dollars.
	   Wednesday, Aug. 26 _ Central bank cancels already-agreed dollar
sales for first time. Ruble falls to 8.26 to dollar.
	   Thursday, Aug. 27 _ Opposition demands that Yeltsin resign,
drafts power-sharing agreement and package of Soviet-style economic
measures.
	   Friday, Aug. 28 _ Yeltsin goes on national television to declare
he won't resign. Currency trades suspended for third straight day.
	   Saturday, Aug. 29 _ Chernomyrdin begins negotiating
power-sharing agreement with parliament, declares Russia will not
return to a Soviet-style economy. Ruble's street value at about 10
to the dollar.
	   Sunday, Aug. 30 _ The interim government and parliamentary
leaders agree to a tentative, 18-month truce that would include
confirming Chernomyrdin as prime minister. Communists scuttle the
deal late in the evening.
	   Monday, Aug. 31 _ The State Duma, or lower house of parliament,
rejects Chernomyrdin 253-94. Yeltsin immediately resubmits
Chernomyrdin's candidacy.
	   Tuesday, Sept. 1 _ Yeltsin says he insists on Chernomyrdin.
Currency trading suspended for fifth straight day. Ruble's street
value falls to 12 to the dollar.
	   Wednesday, Sept. 2 _ Duma schedules vote on Chernomyrdin's
candidacy for Friday, but urges Yeltsin to come up with a new,
compromise candidate. The Central Bank orders six commercial banks
to close their branches temporarily. The ruble falls to 12.8.
	   Thursday, Sept. 3 _ Official ruble rate falls to 13.5 rubles to
the dollar, with the street value much lower.
	   Friday, Sept. 4 _ The Duma postpones vote on approving
Chernomyrdin. The Central Bank revokes its order to freeze accounts
at commercial banks. Official ruble rate falls to 16.99 to the
dollar.
	   Saturday, Sept. 5 _ Communists and other hard-liners propose
nine alternates to Chernomyrdin, including several Soviet-era
bureaucrats. Ruble's value is down to 18 to a dollar in street
trading.
	   Monday, Sept. 7 _ Yeltsin holds face-to-face meeting with
opposition lawmakers and trade union leaders in an attempt to agree
on forming a new government. But the effort is unsuccessful and the
Duma again rejects Chernomyrdin 278-138. The ruble crashes to about
21 to a dollar in street trading.
	   Tuesday, Sept. 8 _ Yeltsin hesitates over prime minister choice,
huddling with his top aides at a country residence.
	   Wednesday, Sept. 9 _ Yeltsin goes a second day without
nominating a prime minister, spurring speculation that he may be
willing to select a compromise candidate. The ruble strengthens
dramatically to about 15 to a dollar.
	   Thursday, Sept. 10 _ Bowing to opposition, Yeltsin nominates
acting foreign minister and former spy chief Yevgeny Primakov as
prime minister. Opposition and pro-government factions welcome the
choice, predicting easy approval for Primakov. The ruble continues

IMF calls on Indonesia to curb soaring rice prices amid protests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Indonesia-Protests

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund on
Thursday called on Indonesia, plagued by looting, riots and
protests, to take quick steps to curb the soaring price of rice.
	   Speaking after meeting senior Indonesian officials, including
President B.J. Habibie, the IMF's top man in Asia, Hubert Neiss,
said Indonesia needs to take ``immediate measures to stop the rise
in rice prices and to increase the supply.''
	   Rice shortages and rising prices have become a major source of
discontent among Indonesia's 202 million people as the sprawling
Southeast Asian island nation grapples with the worst economic
crisis in more than 30 years.
	   Shortages have led to sporadic looting and riots around the
country.
	   Rice is the country's No. 1 staple and its high price has drawn
anger from many Indonesians.
	   The problem is shaping up as a key political issue for Habibie
as he attempts to turn around Indonesia's ailing economy and
institute democratic reforms following the resignation of his
autocratic predecessor President Suharto last May.
	   On Thursday, students staged a fourth day of protest against
Habibie saying he must lower food prices or quit.
	   A peaceful march by about 700 students was blocked by troops and
police outside Habibie's state palace in Jakarta.
	   Earlier in the week security personnel used sticks and tear gas
to evict hundreds of students from the grounds of the national
Parliament.
	   On Wednesday, a trip by Habibie to Indonesia's second largest
city, Surabaya, was marred when 4,000 people took to the streets in
what was the biggest protest against his three-month presidency.
	   The government has been importing rice and selling subsidized
rice to long queues of poor people in cities and town across
Indonesia for months.
	   However, this attempt to keep a lid on prices has so far failed.
	   Neiss suggested that more rice supplies be put onto the
Indonesian market. The distribution of subsidized rice to the needy
must be ``rapidly expanded'' and adequate rice stockpiles must be
maintained, he said.
	   Indonesia needs to import 4.1 million tons this year to make up
for a shortfall in domestic rice production following a drought
last year. Through August, Indonesia had imported 2.44 million tons
of rice.

Media group confirms talks with Arsenal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Arsenal confirmation; report of 275 million pound
bid; fan reaction, Wenger quote &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ First Manchester United, now Arsenal.
	   One day after United's board accepted a record dlrs 1 billion
takeover bid from Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB television, Arsenal said
Thursday it was in negotiations with another media group.
	   Arsenal and Carlton Communications issued statements saying they
were in preliminary discussions. They gave no details of the talks
or whether they involved the possible purchase of the reigning
Premier League and FA Cup champions.
	   ``We have discussed with Arsenal Football Club a range of ways
in which our two companies could work together,'' a Carlton
statement said. ``These discussions are at an early stage.''
	   Arsenal's statement said, ``The board of Arsenal FC confirm that
it has held preliminary discussions with Carlton Communications Plc
concerning a range of ways in which the two companies might work
together. These discussions are at an early stage.''
	   The London Evening Standard said the talks involved a possible
275-million-pound (dlrs 459.2 million) takeover. The paper said
negotiations to buy Arsenal ``have been under way for some time but
a deal is not believed imminent.''
	   The announcement came a day after the board of Manchester United
accepted a 623-million-pound (dlrs 1 billion) bid from BSkyB, the
highest amount ever paid for a sports franchise.
	   The Manchester United takeover, which still needs approval by
the club's shareholders and government regulators, sparked
speculation of the possibility of a series of takeovers of soccer
teams by media companies.
	   ``After yesterday's Manchester United deal, the big clubs are
realizing it is better to pick your partner and be one of the first
in, rather than hang around,'' said William Davies, a soccer
analyst with London stockbroker Albert E. Sharp.
	   While some Manchester United fans have vowed to fight the
proposed Murdoch takeover, there was a sense of inevitability among
Arsenal fans gathered outside the club's Highbury stadium Thursday
in north London.
	   ``I suppose now that Manchester United have done it, we have to
as well,'' teenage student Lynette Dowden said. ``But it's all
about money these days. It's not the football that matters any
more.''
	   Shelley Johnson, a 21-year-old student teacher, concurred.
	   ``I don't particularly like it, but if Manchester United get all
the money from Sky they might run away with everything. We've got
to compete somehow.''
	   Along with Manchester United and Liverpool, Arsenal is one of
the clubs which could take part in a proposed European Super League
starting in 2000.
	   A lucrative takeover could help the club finance a new stadium
to replace Highbury, which has a capacity of just 38,000 and is
considered too small to meet current demand.
	   The current Arsenal team is coached by Frenchman Arsene Wenger
and features a lineup of international stars including Dutch
striker Dennis Bergkamp and French World Cup winners Patrick Vieira
and Emmanuel Petit.
	   Earlier this week, Wenger warned of an outbreak of takeovers by
media companies.
	   ``I would be worried because there is a danger that the rules
change,'' he said. ``We can all see what influence television
already has on the game and I think it would be a threat to the
game if there was more heavy involvement with media in other
clubs.''
	   The Gunners played a 0-0 tie with London rival Chelsea on
Wednesday night. They travel to Leicester on Saturday and open
their European Champions League campaign next week against French
side Lens.
	   Arsenal is listed on the Ofex stock exchange, smaller and more
informal than the principal London stock market.
	   On Wednesday, the club was valued at 162.4 million pounds (dlrs
271 million). After the announcement of the talks with Carlton,
shares soared Thursday and the club was revalued at 176.4 million
pounds (dlrs 294.5 million).
	   There are 56,000 shares in Arsenal. The club is run by chairman
Peter Hill-Wood and vice chairman David Dein.
	   Carlton Communications owns the Carlton Television company in
London and the Midland's Central Television and Westcountry
Television.
	   The group is a major seller of advertising airtime on TV and
cinema, and a 50 percent partner with Granada Group in ON Digital,
the digital TV consortium.
	   While Carlton is smaller than Murdoch's media empire, it has the
television franchise for London as well as a number of others
across Britain.
	   Financial experts now expect Liverpool, Newcastle and possibly
Chelsea to be the next clubs sought after by media companies.
	   Granada, which owns TV franchises in both the Liverpool and
Newcastle area, is considered a potential bidder.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A rocket launched by Russia to put 12 U.S.
commercial satellites into orbit failed minutes after blast-off on
Thursday and burned up in the atmosphere along with its cargo.
	   The Ukrainian-made Zenit-2 booster was launched shortly after
midnight by Russian space forces from the Baikonur cosmodrome which
Moscow rents from the former Soviet republic of Kazakstan.
	   In the fifth minute of flight the rocket's control system
failed, shutting down the engines.
	   Fragments of the rocket and the Globalstar satellites, built by
the Space Systems Loral company, fell in a sparsely populated area
in southern Siberia, the Russian Space Agency said in a statement
carried by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The Russian Space Agency blamed the Ukrainian manufacturer of
the rocket, the state-owned design and production center Yuzhnoye,
for the failed launch, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   ``The launching was considered Ukraine's responsibility; the
Russian side exercised only general coordination of the work under
the project,'' the agency's spokesman Vyacheslav Mikhailichenko
said.
	   An official investigation was underway.
	   The contract's value wasn't announced, but a usual price for
such launches stands at around dlrs 30 million, the report said.
	   The launch insurance would cover the loss of satellites for
Loral, which may build another 12 satellites, and Ukraine will
provide another Zenit booster for a new launch, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Five more launches are planned by mid-1999 to put 36 more
Globalstar satellites into orbit. Two Zenit-2 rockets will carry 12
satellites each, and another 12 satellites will be put into orbit
by three of Russia's Soyuz rockets.
	   Thursday's launch was the eighth failure of the two-stage
Zenit-2 out of a total of 31, but Russian and Ukrainian officials
declare it the best in its class and have ambitious plans for the
booster.
	   The same rocket, equipped with a third stage, is to be used in
the Sea Launch international program which would carry out
commercial launches from sea platforms.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. envoy Dennis Ross held talks with Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday amid signs that the gaps on
the scope of an Israeli withdrawal in the West Bank were narrowing.
	   ``It looks like both sides are interested in finding a way
forward,'' Ross said, hinting at progress.
	   The envoy will now decide whether to start drafting at least
part of an agreement on a pullback, said a U.S. official who spoke

Yeltsin assures Germany that Primakov would stick to reform course
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout with Primakov, Kinkel speaking by phone. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin assured
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl by phone Thursday that his new choice
for prime minister would stick to market reforms if confirmed, the
government said.
	   In the telephone conversation, Yeltsin also promised the new
government will do everything to overcome the dangers for Russia's
economic development, Kohl spokesman Otto Hauser said in a news
release.
	   Bowing to pressure from the Russian parliament, Yeltsin
nominated Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, his former spy chief,
to be prime minister Thursday after his first choice, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, withdrew his name.
	   Russia's opposition-dominated parliament twice refused to
confirm Chernomyrdin. But both opposition and pro-government
politicians in Russia welcomed Primakov's nomination. A
confirmation vote could come as early as Friday.
	   Primakov himself spoke by phone with German Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel, assuring him that Russia would stick to its current
course on economic and foreign policy matters, the Foreign Ministry
said.
	   Kinkel offered Germany's continued support for Russia's reform
process, the ministry said.
	   Before the phone conversion, Kinkel said in a statement that he
has long been friends with Primakov and is convinced that he will
not support a return to a Soviet-style command economy.
	   ``Primakov definitely earns our trust,'' Kinkel said.

Israeli planes raid south Lebanon after 4 militiamen killed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Israel confirming 4 deaths; RECASTS
lead to CLARIFY position of hideouts. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes blasted suspected
guerrilla hideouts Thursday in southern Lebanon after guerrillas
killed four pro-Israeli militiamen.
	   Earlier, Lebanese anti-aircraft guns opened fire on eight
Israeli jets as they flew low over Beirut, rattling windows as one
fighter broke the sound barrier twice.
	   Witnesses said they saw no sign that the planes were hit.
	   The flight over the Lebanese capital appeared to be an Israeli
show of force after a second roadside bombing in two days killed
members of its South Lebanon Army allies.
	   Two Israeli jets fired a missile each at guerrilla targets
outside the southern town of Mashghara at 2:30 p.m. (1130GMT),
Lebanese security officials said.
	   The jets appeared to be pursuing guerrillas who had detonated a
roadside bomb that killed four members of the Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army about three hours earlier.
	   Black smoke billowed from the area over the mountains from the
site of the strike near Jezzine, a town about 40 kilometers (25
miles) southeast of Beirut. There was no word of casualties.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman said warplanes struck
``terrorist targets'' in southern Lebanon. He confirmed reports
from Lebanese security officials that four SLA militiamen were
killed in the bombing.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah group said its guerrillas had
carried out Thursday's attack on a militia vehicle.
	   On Wednesday a Hezbollah bomb killed two militiamen and wounded
five others.
	   Hezbollah is trying to oust 1,500 Israeli troops and 2,500
militiamen from a border zone that Israel has occupied in Lebanon
since 1985 in a bid to protect its northern settlements from
guerrilla attacks.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The domestic national product of all Arab
countries has risen by 3.4 percent from dlrs 575 billion in 1996 to
about dlrs 600 billion in 1997, a report said Thursday.
	   The combined Arab economic report, discussed by the Arab
League's Economic and Social Council in meetings that ended
Wednesday, said the population of Arabs at the end of 1997 reached
264 million, with a 2.5 percent annual growth rate.
	   Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted the report as saying Arab
industrial production rose by 4 percent while agricultural
production last year fell by 9.2 percent. It said cultivated lands
shrank by 12.4 percent due to low rain fall and bad weather

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The price index of the Kuwait Stock Exchange
closed at 2,174.1 points at the end of the trading week, up 46.7
points, or 2.2 percent, from the previous week, the National
Investments Co. said Thursday.
	   In a weekly report, the company said investors were buying
cheaper stocks of local companies, and speculation was strong on
those of United Arab Emirates firms.
	   Trading volume rose 70 percent this week reaching 730.97 million
shares, the company said. The increase in the value of these shares
was even higher at 76 percent and 133.11 million dinars (dlrs 435
million).
	   Of the 76 companies listed on the exchange, 65 were traded this
week. Twenty closed higher, 26 lower, and 19 were unchanged,
according to the report.
	   The exchange is described as the most active in Arab countries.
However, trading is limited to Kuwaitis and nationals of other Arab

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations has approved 21
contracts worth dlrs 35.6 million for spare parts needed to rebuild
Iraq's oil industry, a U.N. spokesman said Thursday.
	   The parts will arrive in Iraq as soon as the companies can ship
them, said the spokesman, Eric Falt.
	   The contracts approved still fall far short of the dlrs 300
million earmarked for the industry during the fourth and enhanced
phase of U.N. exemptions known as the oil-for-food deal.
	   Iraq has complained the Untied States and Britain deliberately
slowed down the process by which the U.N. committee approves the
contracts to hamper production of oil, Iraq's main money earner.
	   The fourth phase allows Iraq up to dlrs 5.2 billion in oil
sales. But Iraq and the United Nations said it could not produce
more than dlrs 2.8 billion, delaying the implementation of projects
in some sectors like electricity and communications.
	   Allocations for food and medicines will not be delayed.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Share prices slightly increased, but
turnover slipped on the stock exchange this week because of
sluggish activity resulting from uncertainty over a settlement
between neighboring Israel and the Palestinians, brokers said
Thursday.
	   A market report, reflecting activity for five business days
ending Wednesday, said the 60-company general share prices index
increased by 0.31 percent to 177.73 points.
	   Shares of commercial banks nudged up by 0.91 percent. But shares
of industrial firms dropped by 1.3 percent, the services sector by
0.60 percent and insurance firms by 0.07 percent.
	   Turnover declined by 29.2 percent to 3.71 Jordanian dinars (dlrs

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The U.N. Fund for Population Activities has
granted Jordan dlrs 800,000 to promote housing projects, the
state-run Petra news agency said Thursday.
	   The grant is part of a U.N. package worth dlrs 4 million that
will be dispersed to Jordan by 2002, Petra said.
	   The dlrs 800,000 will be spent on state-proposed programs to
improve living conditions and the infrastructure of poor districts
in Jordan and provide affordable housing for medium and low-income
Jordanians, the agency said.
	   ``The money will also be spent on four government projects which
aim at reducing the population growth rate, fighting poverty and
preserving the environment,'' Abdul-Razzaq Bani Hani, a Planning
Ministry secretary-general, was quoted as telling Petra.
	   The agency said the U.N. Fund for Population Activities has
granted Jordan dlrs 16 million since 1976 which was spent on
population projects and educational television and radio programs
on population and development.

Israeli planes raid south Lebanon after 4 militiamen killed

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes blasted suspected
guerrilla hideouts in southern Lebanon on Thursday after guerrillas
killed four pro-Israeli militiamen.
	   Earlier, Lebanese anti-aircraft guns opened fire on eight
Israeli jets as they flew low over Beirut, rattling windows as one
fighter broke the sound barrier twice.
	   Witnesses said they saw no sign of the planes being hit.
	   The flight over the Lebanese capital appeared to be an Israeli
show of force after a second roadside bombing in two days killed
members of its South Lebanon Army allies.
	   Two Israeli jets fired a missile each at guerrilla targets
outside the southern town of Mashghara at 2:30 p.m. (1130GMT),
Lebanese security officials said.
	   The jets returned about an hour later and fired two more
missiles at guerrilla infiltration trails in a mountainous area
near Jezzine, a town about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of
Beirut, the officials said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   There was no word on casualties from the air strikes.
	   The jets appeared to be pursuing guerrillas who had detonated a
roadside bomb that killed four SLA militiamen about three hours
earlier.
	   Black smoke billowed from the area which is over the mountains
from the bombing site outside Jezzine, which is controlled by SLA
militiamen.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman said warplanes struck
``terrorist targets'' in southern Lebanon. He confirmed reports
from Lebanese security officials that four SLA militiamen were
killed in the bombing.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah group said its guerrillas had
carried out Thursday's attack on a militia vehicle.
	   On Wednesday a Hezbollah bomb killed two militiamen and wounded
five others.

Report: Taiwan's intelligence chief visits Moscow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's civilian intelligence chief held
talks with Russian officials in Moscow on how the two nations can
work together to fight crime, Taiwan Television reported Thursday.
	   Wang Kuang-yu, head of the Bureau of Investigation, said he met
with officials in the Russian intelligence agency's department of
international cooperation.
	   ``We've always believed that there are no national borders in
crime fighting,'' Wang told the station.
	   ``If we were to establish a cooperative relationship, it would
have positive results for everyone.''
	   The station reported Wang's arrival in Moscow on Tuesday, but
Taiwanese government officials have declined to comment.
	   Former cold war antagonists, Russia and Taiwan have slowly built
up trade relations over the past decade, and unofficial ties
between their two governments have been established in recent
years.
	   Like most countries, Russia has diplomatic ties with China,
which considers Taiwan a breakaway province to be reunited with by
force if necessary.
	   The United Evening said Wang's trip is just the most recent
exchange in the gradual development of relations between the
Taiwanese and Russian intelligence agencies.

Thai convicts trained to grow food during economic recession
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai convicts are being taught how to
farm so they can survive the country's economic recession after
their release.
	   The Correction Department said Thursday that those who complete
serving their prison terms will be able to work on a farm next to
the prison in the northern Bangkok suburb of Pathum Thani.
	   The farm will supply food for the prison, with the surplus sold
on the open market, it said.
	   Officials say the plan will kill two birds with one stone _
supplying the prison with cheap food and ensuring employment to
ex-convicts in a tough job market.
	   The pilot self-reliance project emphasizing farming will start
next Monday, said Surang Ekachote, director of the vocational
investment division.
	   There will be 100 convicts taking part in the program, selected
from among 3,500 convicts on the basis of their good behavior.
	   ``Most of these young convicts are to finish their jail terms
within a year or two,'' said Surang. ``They will soon step out into
their world of freedom which has been hit hard by the economic
recession.''
	   About 2 million Thais are expected to be jobless by the end of
the year.

Nazi war crimes trial postponed indefinitely
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LIUDAS DAPKUS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ A Lithuanian court on Thursday ordered
an indefinite postponement in the Nazi war-crimes trial of
Aleksandras Lileikis, whom his lawyers say is too ill to attend the
proceedings.
	   The court said it would appoint a medical commission to
determine if the 91-year-old Lileikis is too sick to speak in his
own defense.
	   Lileikis, who was head of the Vilnius security police during the
1941-44 Nazi occupation, is charged with genocide for allegedly
ordering scores of Jews to be arrested and handed over to a Nazi
execution squad.
	   The trial was to have opened Wednesday, after a number of delays
that prompted criticism from Jewish groups who contend that
Lithuanian authorities are trying to draw out the procedures until
Lileikis dies.
	   The trial was postponed for one day on Wednesday after Lileikis'
attorneys said he was hospitalized. On Thursday, the court accepted
a hospital report saying he suffers from a number of ailments,
including poor circulation to the brain.
	   If the commission determines that Lileikis is unable to speak in
his own defense, the trial likely would never be held. Lileikis
could be tried in absentia only if were trying to unlawfully evade
trial, or if he were abroad and refused to return to Lithuania, the
three-judge panel said Thursday.
	   About 90 percent of Lithuania's prewar Jewish population of
240,000 died during the Nazi occupation.
	   Lileikis emigrated in 1955 to the United States, and lived in
Norwood, Massachusetts, where he worked for a Lithuanian publishing
house.
	   Based on documents that came to light after the dissolution of
the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States began steps to revoke
Lileikis' citizenship on the grounds that he lied about his past.
	   Lileikis returned to Lithuania in 1996, but it was not until
early this year that he was charged. Jewish groups have accused
Lithuanian authorities of dragging their feet in hopes of avoiding
a trial.
	   The criticism continued on Thursday, with Efriam Zuroff of the
Nazi-hunting Simon Wiesenthal Center asking ``If Lileikis feels
innocent, why doesn't he come here and prove it?''
	   But spectator Petras Cidzikas, reflecting the views of many,
said he was pleased that the proceedings against Lileikis could be
over.
	   ``I believe this is the last sitting of this shameful trial,''
he said.

Canadian player back after suffering severed finger

 &UR; Eds: ADDS game postponed because of sick Welsh players &QL;

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Canadian field hockey sweeper
Lauralee Kopeck was due to be back in action Thursday just four
days after losing the top of her finger in a Commonwealth Games
trial match.
	   But the game was called off because eight of her opponents had
fallen sick with gastroenteritis.
	   Kopeck had the top of her little finger sliced off when it was
caught between her hockey stick and a fast moving ball.
	   Team doctor Peter Fowler sewed the missing piece back onto
Kopeck's finger after Canadian officials found it on the playing
field.
	   ``She was defending a short corner and an opponent smashed the
ball, it hit her little finger and sheared off the end of it,''
Fowler said Thursday. ``The doctor at the game saw the bone exposed
and sent her to our clinic at the village in an ambulance. After
the game, they found her finger on the field, brought it around and
we sewed it back on.''
	   Fowler said that although the section of finger had died,
Kopeck's operation was successful.
	   ``She's playing in tonight's match,'' Fowler said. ``She wanted
to play yesterday but I guess the team figured they had the
opposition under control.''
	   Hours later, the team learned the game had been postponed
because four of the Welsh team were in hospital suffering from
gastroenteritis and four more were under treatment.
	   Kopeck, whose nickname is Jumbo, warmed up with the Canadian
team before its 3-0 win over Namibia on Wednesday.
	   Team leader Margie Schuett used Kopeck, a veteran of two World
Cups and the 1992 Olympics, as an example of the Canadian spirit in
the face of questioning over the withdrawals of several big name
talents.
	   Canada's world 100-meter record holder Donovan Bailey and fellow
sprint star Bruny Surin have decided not to compete here after a
long season while Olympic swim medalist Curtis Myden has stayed
away to study.
	   ``This kid hasn't winced, hasn't whined, hasn't complained,''
said Schuett. ``She has her finger taken off and goes right back
out there and competes again.''

South Korean chip makers protest anti-dumping ruling

 &UR; Eds: RESTORES dropped word `billion' in 8th graf

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Two South Korean computer chip makers
on Thursday protested a U.S. ruling that they have been selling
their products below cost, an illegal practice known as dumping.
	   LG Semicon and Hyundai Electronics Co. planned to dispute the
ruling in the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York,
accusing the U.S. Commerce Department of making ``serious errors''
in its pricing review.
	   ``We will not stand idly by while our reputation as a fair and
competitive supplier of DRAMs is impugned,'' a statement from LG
Semicon said.
	   On Wednesday, the U.S. Commerce Department imposed a 9.28
percent anti-dumping tariff on DRAM, or dynamic random access
memory, chips from LG Semicon and a 3.95 percent duty on products
from Hyundai Electronics.
	   It was the first time the two South Korean chip makers were
forced to pay a penalty on their shipments to the U.S. market.
South Korea's leading DRAM maker, Samsung, was not subject to the
U.S. penalty.
	   LG alleged errors in the U.S. calculations and said the U.S.
government falsely based its ruling on LG products ``unlawfully
diverted to the U.S. market by third parties.''
	   LG sells about dlrs 200 million worth of chips in the United
States annually. Hyundai's share of the U.S. market is worth about
dlrs 800 million.
	   Hyundai called the U.S. ruling ``unacceptable'' but said it
would not be seriously affected because 90 percent of the chips it
sells in the United States will come from its new dlrs 1.3 billion
plant in Eugene, Oregon.
	   The two Korean firms have been cited for alleged dumping each
year since 1993. Until this year, they had been cleared of the
charge each time.
	   The Commerce Department began its investigation after Micron
Technology Inc. of Boise, Idaho, and other U.S. chip makers alleged
dumping by their South Korean competitors.
	   In July 1997, the Seoul government filed a complaint with the
World Trade Organization, demanding that the United States stop its
annual investigation.
	   Computer memory chips are South Korea's key export item. The
country accounted for 34 percent of the world's dlrs 20.9 billion
DRAM market last year.
	   Micron and other U.S. chip makers have accused their South
Korean competitors of creating a global oversupply.
	   The price of DRAM chips _ which allow computers and other
electronic devices to store data for quick retrieval _ has dropped
80 percent in the past year, industry officials say.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Anti-corruption investigators
have arrested nine officers in the national police unit assigned to
control illegal immigration.
	   The suspects were charged variously with theft, fraud,
blackmail, corruption and defeating the ends of justice, The Star
of Johannesburg.
	   The officers, who were arrested Wednesday, allegedly accepted
bribes or extorted sex from illegal aliens seeking to enter the
country or avoid deportation.
	   A home affair immigration official was arrested along with the
police, who included the unit's former acting head.
	   Hundreds of thousands of people from neighboring countries each
year seek to enter South Africa, looking for work in its relatively
developed economy.

	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Twenty-five political organizations have
applied to become parties ahead of Nigeria's Feb. 27 elections,
with officials scrambling to meet the midnight Wednesday deadline
for the initial screening.
	   Seven groups had their registrations rejected for such problems
as incomplete documentation, state-owned radio said Thursday.
	   The Independent National Electoral Commission will review the
applications and announce which groups have been granted
provisional approval on Sept. 24.
	   Nigeria's military ruler, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, has opened
up his country's political system since the death of former
dictator Gen. Sani Abacha.
	   Abubakar has freed political prisoners, invited exiles to return
and promised a return to civilian rule at the end of May.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The Central Bank of Kenya said Thursday it
will suspend any commercial bank that writes bad checks.
	   ``Following a spate of check kiting the Central Bank and the
Kenya Bankers Association have decided to suspend any bank involved
in check kiting from the clearinghouse with the attendant
consequences,'' the CBK said in a statement issued Wednesday.
	   Reuben Marambii, CBK's chief banking manager, said some banks
were issuing checks knowing there was not enough money on account
to cover the debit, but hoping it would be deposited in time.
	   He said check kiting normally involves quick transactions
between banks and institutions which trust each other.

	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Uganda risks losing a substantial amount
of money and free publicity after the Ministry of Tourism blocked a
two-week white water rafting tournament scheduled for next year,
New Vision newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The Camel White Water Rafting tournament was to take place next
July on the Nile River under the sponsorship of U.S. tobacco
company R.J. Reynolds, makers of the Camel cigarette brand, the
newspaper said.
	   It reported Mick Barnett of Adrift Uganda Ltd., the event's
local promoter, as saying the contest was expected to draw
participants from 15 countries and major television networks
worldwide planned to broadcast the event to at least a billion
viewers in 140 countries.
	   Barnett said the ministry acted under pressure from Nile
Independent Power, which plans a dlrs 450 million 250 mega watt
hydroelectric plant near the site of the planned contest, about 70
kilometers (44 miles) east of Kampala.
	   Barnett said the power company was misleading the government by
saying the plant's international financiers would withdraw support
should the event take place.
	   Christian Wright, a representative of the power company, denied
interference, saying the contest would not affect his company's
plans.
	   Government officials were unavailable for comment, the newspaper
said.
	   White rafting has increasingly become popular with the number of
tourists rising from 490 in 1996 to 3,333 in August this year.

	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ International donors and financiers

financial assistance and loans because of rampant corruption, New
Vision Newspaper reported Thursday.
	   ``The donor community would like to express its continued
concern about corruption, which it considers a serious problem to
be addressed as a matter of urgency,'' the donors said in a joint
statement early this week. ``There have been allegations of
corruption involving senior officials and large scale misuse of
public funds.''
	   Uganda received some 640 billion shillings (dlrs 500 million)
from donors towards its 1997/98 budget. This year, the East African
nation benefited from the Indebted Poor Countries Initiative with a
debt relief of over 700 billion shillings (dlrs 550 million) over
30 years.
	   ``Donors have in the execution of projects they fund encountered
a significance number of instances of financial irregularities,''
the statement said. ``This creates a perception of tolerance for
corruption which, if unaddressed, can be injurious to
donor-government relations.''
	   Signatories to the statement included the World Bank, the
International Monetary Fund, United Nations agencies, the European
Union and the African Development Bank.

Ross, Netanyahu meet; U.S. weighing whether to start draft
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES top three grafs with Ross hinting at progress &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. envoy Dennis Ross held talks with Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday amid signs that the gaps on
the scope of an Israeli withdrawal in the West Bank were narrowing.
	   ``It looks like both sides are interested in finding a way
forward,'' Ross said, hinting at progress.
	   The envoy will now decide whether to start drafting at least
part of an agreement on a pullback, said a U.S. official who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
	   Ross is accompanied by Jonathan Schwartz, a U.S. State
Department legal adviser who drafted the 1997 agreement on an
Israeli withdrawal from most of the West Bank town of Hebron.
	   The Haaretz daily said Ross hopes to get something on paper by
the weekend, but that some issues would have to be finalized at the
highest levels, perhaps at a summit later this month when
Netanyahu, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill
Clinton attend the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
	   On the table is a U.S. proposal for an Israeli withdrawal from
13 percent of the West Bank and detailed provisions for Palestinian
cooperation with Israel and the United States on security.
	   Israel initially rejected a 13 percent pullback, but then said
it would agree, provided that 3 percent of that area is declared a
nature reserve in which Israel retains security control and the
Palestinians are not to be allowed to build.
	   The Palestinians have said they accepted temporary restrictions,
but wanted assurances that the area eventually would come under
full Palestinian control.
	   Asked about the Palestinian demands, Netanyahu adviser David
Bar-Illan, said Thursday: ``We don't believe that would be an
obstacle. The main thing is that we would have security control and
the veto on construction which would prevent the building of
military installations.''
	   The most difficult issue facing Ross is Israel's demand to
renegotiate an agreement on security cooperation.
	   A blueprint for Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation and a
Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants was worked out by
Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. security officials last December, but
was rejected by Netanyahu as insufficient.
	   The Palestinians initially said they would not agree to changes,
but in recent days have softened their position.
	   The Yediot Ahronot daily said the Palestinians would consider
renegotiating the security understanding, provided that Israel
agreed to all elements of the U.S. peace initiative, including
proposals on how to determine the size of an additional withdrawal.
	   The Palestinians ``will not allow the fragmentation of the
American initiative,'' Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said
Wednesday evening, after Ross talked for three hours with Arafat.
	   Leaving the meeting with Arafat, Ross did not answer directly
when asked whether the Clinton administration was committed to all
points of the U.S. plan, first presented in January.
	   But Erekat said later the American envoy had pledged to deal
with issues ``in a comprehensive manner.''
	   Before the Ross-Arafat meeting, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright spoke with Arafat by telephone, stressing the importance
of settling remaining differences, U.S. State Department spokesman
James P. Rubin said in Washington.
	   In other developments Thursday:
	   _ A Palestinian woman hurt during clashes in a Jerusalem refugee
camp died of her wounds. The woman, 41-year-old Kamila Nather, was
walking in the street on Saturday when she was struck in the face
by a rubber-coated steel pellet fired by Israeli troops trying to
disperse Palestinian stone throwers.
	   _ Near the West Bank town of Hebron, Israeli army bulldozers
uprooted olive and fig trees on a 1.5-acre (0.6-hectare) plot the
Palestinian owner said has been confiscated for security reasons.
The plot is adjacent to a road bypassing Hebron and leading to the
Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.

German opposition, still ahead in polls, presents new ads
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ With the Sept. 27 election nearing, the
opposition Social Democrats unveiled new advertising for the
campaign's final days as polls showed them holding on to their lead
over Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
	   Under the theme ``new courage, new strength, new ideas,'' the ad
campaign seeks to present Social Democratic challenger Gerhard
Schroeder as a fresh face compared to Kohl, who is seeking a record
fifth term.
	   ``We want to focus the campaign on the decision between Kohl and
Schroeder,'' said Social Democratic general manager Franz
Muentefering.
	   ``The last three weeks will be decisive,'' he said, adding
``we're still doing good.''
	   An analysis of recent polls published Thursday by Die Welt
newspaper showed the Social Democrats still firmly ahead of Kohl's
center-right coalition, 42 percent to 37 percent.
	   The SPD's expected coalition partner, the environmentalist Green
party, would capture 6 percent of the vote, while Kohl's junior
coalition partner, the Free Democrats, were at 5.5 percent.
	   The figures represent an evaluation by the media analysis
institute Campo Data of the most recent surveys by all respected
polling agencies.

	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ A Lithuanian court on Thursday ordered
an indefinite postponement in the Nazi war-crimes trial of
Aleksandras Lileikis, who his lawyers say is too ill to attend the
proceedings.
	   The court said it would appoint a medical commission to
determine if the 91-year-old Lileikis is too sick to speak in his
own defense.
	   Lileikis, who was head of the Vilnius security police during the
1941-44 Nazi occupation, is charged with genocide for allegedly
ordering scores of Jews to be arrested and handed over to a Nazi
execution squad.
	   The trial was to have opened Wednesday, after a number of delays
that prompted criticism from Jewish groups who contend that
Lithuanian authorities are trying to draw out the procedures until
Lileikis dies.
	   The trial was postponed for one day on Wednesday after Lileikis'
attorneys said he was hospitalized. On Thursday, the court accepted
a hospital report saying he suffers from a number of ailments,
including poor circulation to the brain.
	   If the commission determines that Lileikis is unable to speak in
his own defense, the trial likely would never be held. Lileikis
could be tried in absentia only if he were trying to unlawfully
evade trial, or if he were abroad and refused to return to
Lithuania, the three-judge panel said Thursday.

Yugoslav official: KLA controls no territory, has no leadership
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The Kosovo Liberation Army no longer has
any leadership and the group does not control any territory in the
Serbian province of Kosovo, the Yugoslav foreign minister claimed
Thursday.
	   ``If they ever had any leadership or any center, I think they
are now without that,'' said Zivadin Jovanovic following a meeting
here with his Greek counterpart Theodoros Pangalos.
	   ``There is no territory of Kosovo ... under the so-called UCK,''
Jovanovic claimed, using the Albanian acronym for the group.
	   The Yugoslav minister also alleged 60,000 of the Kosovo
residents who had fled the fighting in the province have now
returned home.
	   His statement came one day after Western observers reported a
new exodus of tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians from villages
under fire in southwestern Kosovo.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since February,
when Serb forces cracked down on ethnic Albanian militants fighting
for independence. More than 265,000 people have been forced to flee
their homes.
	   But Jovanovic claimed the majority of ethnic Albanians no longer
support the KLA. ``Ethnic Albanian Yugoslav citizens ... no longer
trust separatism and the role of terrorism,'' he said.
	   ``They are more and more publicly, openly stressing their
loyalty to the state of Serbia and the state of Yugoslavia,'' he
alleged. He did not elaborate.
	   Yugoslavia describes the KLA only as a terrorist organization.
``They have never had any significant role except perpetuating acts
of terrorism like kidnapping and taking hostages of civilians,''
Jovanovic insisted.
	   The minister also criticized international sanctions imposed on
Yugoslavia, insisting the situation could only improve if Europe
and the international community embraced the country.
	   ``We never believed that with sanctions and isolation one could
achieve something good,'' Jovanovic said. ``We are sure much will
be achieved only with a Yugoslavia inside the structures and
organizations of Europe and of international organizations, for the
good of Yugoslavia, the Balkan region and of Europe.''

Ribbeck says tough times ahead; Hodgson was also considered
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Erich Ribbeck, the new German soccer
team boss, said Thursday the defending champion will have a tough
time qualifying for the European Championship in 2000.
	   ``It's a challenge for me and for German soccer,'' Ribbeck said
at a news conference at the German soccer federation (DFB)
headquarters in Frankfurt.
	   ``We have to qualify for Euro 2000, that's our goal. It's not
going to be easy, we know that,'' Ribbeck said at his first news
conference after getting the job late Wednesday.
	   Germany's first Euro 2000 qualifying game is Oct. 10 in Turkey.
Germany won the title in 1996. Ribbeck's contract runs through the
2000 finals.
	   Ribbeck, a veteran 61-year-old coach whose Bundesliga jobs
included stints with Bayern Munich and other top clubs, replaced
Berti Vogts, who resigned Monday.
	   Vogts had been under fire since Germany's ouster by Croatia in
the quarterfinals of the World Cup this summer in France.
	   After dismal performances at two exhibition games in Malta last
week, Vogts came under growing pressure and resigned on Monday,
catching DFB officials by surprise.
	   DFB president Egidius Braun conceded Thursday that Ribbeck, who
had been in semi-retirement since being fired by Bayer Leverkusen
in April 1996, was not his first choice.
	   The first man to be asked, former Real Madrid coach Jupp
Heynckes, turned down the offer because of his wife's health.
	   Braun said he considered several Bundesliga coaches but decided
not to approach them officially because they were all bound by
contracts to their clubs.
	   The DFB chief then offered the job to Roy Hodgson, a Briton who
had once coached the Swiss national team.
	   Braun said he withdrew the offer by fax several hours later,
deciding that giving the job to a foreign coach would be an
admittance of the poor state of German soccer.
	   As the search went on, Braun even talked to Paul Breitner, the
former star with the reputation of a rebel who now works as a
soccer commentator and often criticizes the national team.
	   But after reading an interview with Breitner on Wednesday in
which Breitner urged wide-reaching reforms in the DFB, Braun
decided that such a candidate would not be accepted by the DFB
leadership.
	   Braun then decided to offer the job to Ribbeck, who immediately
accepted.
	   Franz Beckenbauer, who coached Germany to its third and last
World Cup title in 1990, said the DFB had squandered a ``great
opportunity to inject some fresh wind'' by dropping Breitner.
	   But Beckenbauer, who retains great influence in German soccer,
later toned down his criticism and said Ribbeck was the ``right
man.''
	   Ulli Stielike, a junior coach with the DFB who was also
considered as team chief, finally was named national team trainer,
in effect Ribbeck's assistant.
	   ``Ribbeck is No. 1, he is fully responsible for the national
team,'' Braun said.
	   Ribbeck gave little indication of what his team would look like.
	   After the World Cup, an entire generation of talented but aging
stars that had carried Germany for a decade decided to retire from
the national team, including Juergen Klinsmann, Lothar Matthaeus
and Juergen Kohler.
	   Others, like Borussia Dortmund veterans Andreas Moeller, Thomas
Haessler and Stefan Reuter, said they would be open to rejoining
under the new coach.
	   ``Let's wait and see what happens,'' Moeller said. ``But he is a
good choice of the DFB.''
	   Ribbeck said he would look for the ``best players, young and
old, and those that blend together well.''
	   He said he would be talking to all the players who retired, but
did not specify which ones he would try to bring back.
	   Ribbeck indicated he would stay true to Germany's libero, or
sweeper, system, the nation's teams have been using for 30 years.
Vogts' unsuccessful attempt to play a zone defense in Malta was a
factor in his resignation.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Ousted deputy Anwar Ibrahim
appears safe from arrest at least until the hordes of foreign
journalists in town for the Commonwealth Games head home.
	   Anwar, who has been holed up for a week at his home in a Kuala
Lumpur suburb, is under police investigation in allegations ranging
from bisexual misconduct to treason.
	   Police have said he could be arrested at any time.
	   But Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad acknowledged Thursday the
foreign media would jump all over the arrest and paint the
Southeast Asian country as ``repressive.''
	   Hundreds of journalists have come to cover the sporting event
that kicks off Friday and runs through Sept. 21.
	   When Anwar was told of Mahathir's comments, he laughed and said,
``That's good news.''
	   Mahathir sacked Anwar last week from his posts of deputy prime
minister and finance minister.
	   Mahathir has said that he conducted his own investigation and
determined that Anwar, formerly his handpicked successor, was
immoral and unfit to lead. Mahathir said Thursday police were still
investigating.
	   ``I'm quite sure when they have sufficient evidence, they will
charge him in court,'' he said.
	   Anwar has denied the charges, saying they were trumped up to sap
his growing challenge to Mahathir's 17-year rule.
	   His virtual house arrest has led thousands of his supporters to
come to him each night to listen to hours of speeches on political
reform.
	   Malaysia's top police chief Rahim Noor said that the police
probe into eight charges against Anwar's sexual misconduct had
reach its ``final stages,'' although he didn't say when it would be
completed.
	   Mahathir waved aside the possibility of imminent arrest, saying
his former deputy was free to move about as he pleases.
	   ``I can assure you that if he wants to go around walking alone
in any part of Malaysia, he can,'' Mahathir said.
	   ``If anybody gets hurt, then he'll get full publicity,
especially in the international press.''
	   The true test may come Friday.
	   Anwar said he intends to travel to Kajang, about 30 kilometers
(18 miles) south of the capital, Friday night to meet with an
Islamic scholar. On Saturday, he plans to drive to his hometown in
the northwestern state of Penang to meet with supporters and launch
his national reform campaign.
	   ``It's totally urgent to get the message out,'' he told The
Associated Press. ``I'm going to meet my constituents in Penang.''
	   Mahathir also accused his former deputy of trying to fend off
arrest by ``surrounding himself with a lot of small boys and
university students'' willing to resist the police.
	   But Anwar dismissed the notion.
	   ``See for yourself, there are lots of girls, women, men and
veterans,'' he said, pointing to hundreds of supporters sitting
under big tents erected in the backyard of his house.
	   Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, who heads the powerful youth wing of the
ruling United Malays National Organization, has continued to show
up in Anwar's backyard.
	   Some party members have called for his resignation. Zahid
refused to resign, saying he would leave the decision to Mahathir
and UMNO's Supreme Council.
	   Mahathir said party leaders are free to see Anwar.
	   ``If they want to go they can go. We have two million, four
hundred thousand members, so we can spare two or three people,'' he
said. ``They can stay there permanently, they can sleep there.''

Bard and the Spice Girls backing Britain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Spice Girls, Shakespeare and the Royal Opera
will share equal billing in a new public-relations campaign to
boost Britain's sometimes stodgy image abroad.
	   Acknowledging that the world ``does not always think us quite as
wonderful as we think we are,'' a government committee called Panel
2000 launched a strategy Thursday that also includes revamping
British embassies, rewarding citizens who put across the best of
Britain abroad, and sprucing up the ``gateways to Britain,''
particularly Heathrow and Gatwick airports.
	   The effort is in line with Prime Minister Tony Blair's ``Cool
Brittania'' campaign to show his nation is not as stuffy and
tradition-bound as some would have it.
	   Foreign Office Minister Derek Fatchett said Panel 2000 was
``very keen to link together artistic activities and commercial
activities.''
	   Fatchett stressed the important role that the National Theater,
the Royal Shakespeare Company and even Scary, Baby, Posh and Sporty
Spice have in creating the right image of Britain abroad.
	   Art, innovative science, dance, sport, computer games and films
are just as important as heritage, theater and classical music, he
said.
	   But while Fatchett was keen to stress the importance of change,
he was reluctant to criticize the way things are now done.
	   Part of the problem, he said, was the lack of data about
perceptions of Britain abroad, which Panel 2000 plans to address.
	   While insisting the staffs of embassies and outposts across the
world were doing a good job, he said there is always room for
improvement.
	   In some instances, he said, it might not be necessary to
``change the image but look for ways in which we can raise our
profile.''

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Only during the many invasions that
mar their history had South Koreans seen so many foreigners as on
those late summer days of 1988.
	   Tens of thousands of people from around the world descended on
Seoul, which only 35 years earlier had been left in ruins and
rubble at the end of the Korean War.
	   But now this bustling city of high-rise monuments to the hard
work and perseverance of South Korea's people was playing host to
the biggest sporting event in the world, the Summer Olympics.
	   For this once destitute Asian nation, it was an affirmation _ a
declaration to the world that it had risen from the ashes in little
more than three decades as an industrial powerhouse.
	   It also was a turning point on South Korea's path to democracy.
	   ``It was an unprecedented festival for the entire nation,'' said
advertising company manager Park Joon-ki. ``I remember everybody,
including even those who had been skeptical about the Olympics,
eventually became very happy and proud.''
	   That pride was warranted. Seoul had not only won the competition
to stage the Olympics, it had pulled off what International Olympic
Committee President Juan Samaranch proclaimed as ``the best and
most universal games in our history.''
	   Ten years later, that feat will be quietly commemorated when
executive board members of the IOC convene a three-day meeting in
Seoul on Monday, timed to coincide with the anniversary of the 1988
Games.
	   The main agenda of the Seoul meeting is a review of preparations
for the next Summer Olympics in Sydney in 2000 and Athens in 2004.
But on the sidelines, the IOC also will hold a series of functions
to celebrate the success of the Seoul Olympics.
	   Those celebrations will include the dedication of a specially
designed, IOC-donated sculpture in memory of the Seoul Games. The
235-centimeter (7-foot, 8-inch) bronze by Italy's Nag Arnoldi
depicts five people representing five continents holding the
Olympic flag.
	   Everyone associated with the Seoul Olympics shared two great
fears: That the games would be disrupted by terrorists from
communist North Korea or by South Koreans demonstrating for
democratic reform of their then dictatorial government.
	   Neither happened. The first Olympics in 12 years to be held
without a boycott stemming from Cold War rivalries came off without
a hitch.
	   In the run-up to the Games, tens of thousands of South Koreans
staged sometimes violent demonstrations almost daily, demanding
democratic reforms, including direct presidential elections.
	   With the world about to focus its attention on Seoul, the
military-backed government feared an international public relations
debacle and finally backed down, accepting most key public demands.
	   ``The Olympics had a substantial impact on citizens' awareness
of democracy, cultivating an international outlook and instilling
self-confidence,'' Koo Kwang-mo, a professor at Chung-Ang
University, said.
	   ``Many people thought that the Games were a chance to advance
democracy. I never was into sports, but I highly value the
Olympics' contribution to our society,'' said Hwang Yong-hee, a
high school math teacher.
	   ``One big side-effect of the Seoul Olympics was liberating South
Koreans from their Cold War mentality by providing an opportunity
for amicable contacts with communist countries,'' Yu Jae-cheon, a
professor at Sogang University, said.
	   Within a few years after the Games, Seoul had established
diplomatic relations with most communist-bloc countries, including
the former Soviet Union and China.
	   Ten years later, the once-pervasive Olympic glory and excitement
are all gone and forgotten by most South Koreans in the midst of
the worst financial crisis in their history.
	   ``These days, when people get together, they all talk about the
economy,'' said housewife Roh Ye-ho. ``I think most people do not
even realize that it is the 10th anniversary of the Olympic
Games.''
	   South Korea was forced to accept a dlrs 58 billion bailout from
the International Monetary Fund in December. Inflation keeps rising
and the unemployment rate has hit a 32-year high of 7.6 percent
with 1.6 million out of work.
	   Weary South Koreans now hope that the 2002 soccer World Cup will
rekindle the same kind of national impetus generated by the 1988
Olympics. South Korea and Japan are co-hosts for the 2002 World
Cup, soccer's first premier event to be held in Asia.
	   Perhaps not coincidentally, the chief South Korean organizer of
the 2002 World Cup is Park Seh-jik, the man who was in charge of
organizing the 1988 Olympics.
	   ``Despite many difficulties, we successfully staged the Seoul
Olympics. If we put our efforts together now as we did for the
Olympics, I believe we'll be able to overcome the current
difficulties,'' Park said.

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Stressing the importance of passing history
lessons on to new generations, Steven Spielberg presented a new
computer CD-ROM with testimony from Holocaust survivors to Berlin
students on Thursday.
	   In Berlin to receive an award from the German government for his
work documenting the Holocaust, the prizewinning filmmaker showed
some of what his foundation had gathered to about 80 high school
students.
	   ``I consider all these people not only to be victims of the
Holocaust, but also teachers,'' Spielberg said of the four
Holocaust survivors whose stories are included on the CD-ROM.
	   The CD-ROM, narrated by Winona Ryder and Leonardo DiCaprio, was
created by Spielberg's Shoah Visual History Foundation, an archive
of filmed interviews with Holocaust survivors. The project has
gathered nearly 50,000 interviews in four years.
	   ``It's a race against time to get as many victims on tape as
possible,'' Spielberg told the students, whose school will receive
100 copies of the CD-ROM next month.
	   On Thursday evening, Spielberg was to receive a medal _ the
Knight Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit _ at a dinner given
by German President Roman Herzog.
	   The medal honors Spielberg's Shoah foundation, as well as his
1993 film ``Schindler's List,'' the story of how a non-Jewish
German industrialist saved the lives of thousands of Jews during
World War II.
	   ___
 &UR; EMBARGOED until 17:30 GMT, time set by source
	   ``No other movie has been watched or discussed by as many school
classes in Germany,'' Herzog said in remarks to be delivered at the
dinner. ``That is why we Germans are especially grateful to you for
this film. It is a monument against oblivion.''
 &UR; End EMBARGOED material
	   ___
	   The English-language CD-ROM, called ``Survivors: Testimonies of
the Holocaust,'' has been made available to U.S. schools for the
fall semester. The interactive program weaves together archival
footage with personal testimonies and photographs.
	   The CD-ROM will be available in Europe in October.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Kenya's 18th International Polo
tournament, Sept. 11-20 at the Nairobi Polo Club, includes teams
from Zimbabwe, England and Argentina.
	   Zimbabweans will face Kenya on Sept. 20 in a level of a 15-goal

Stone-Wigg, with a plus-5 handicap.
	   Among Zimbabwe's players are Bob Crossley, with a plus-2
handicap and chairmanship of the Polo Association of Zimbabwe,
Gordon Watson, with a plus-3 handicap, Duncan Ellis, plus-6 and
national captain of the Zimbabwe side.
	   The Kenya's side holds a handicap of 14, while Zimbabwe has 16.

Lawmakers rule Romanians must report foreign guests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Moving to increase controls on
foreigners, the upper house of parliament voted on Thursday to
impose heavy fines on Romanians who neglect to report overnight
stays of non-citizens.
	   The law, which still needs the approval of parliament's lower
House of Deputies, is not as severe as Communist legislation
forbidding hosting foreigners overnight and obliging Romanians to
report any conversations with them.
	   Like many European countries, Romanian law already requires
foreigners to report their length and place of stay when they enter
the country.
	   However, the draft reflects the wish by authorities to monitor
even more tightly the movement of foreigners amid concerns that
many are illegal in Romania.
	   Between 20,000 and 40,000 illegal aliens were estimated to be in
Romania in 1996, the last year figures are available for.
	   ``We have to protect ourselves, as the whole of Europe does,''
said Senator Nicolae Alexandru by telephone after Senate voted 109
for the motion, with four abstentions and none opposed.
	   Alexandru said most illegal immigrants in Romania are from the
former Soviet Union, Asia, northern Africa and Arab countries.
	   Anyone who breaks the law will can be fined 1.5 million lei
(dlrs 167) _ more than the average monthly salary.

US reigning world champ Koven thwarted by tiny screw
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ Reigning champion James Koven of the
United States saw his bid to defend his single scull crown thwarted
by a tiny screw Thursday, at the world rowing championships.
	   In sharp contrast, a finely-tuned British team enjoyed a banner
day, qualifying six more crews for the finals, spearheaded by their
coxless four of Steve Redgrave, Matthew Pinsent, James Cracknell
and Tim Foster.
	   Koven's semifinal effort began to unravel barely 100m (110
yards) into the 2,000m (1.25 mile) race, the screw in his oar-lock
loosening, allowing his oar to slip dangerously. A choppy wave at
about 250m knocked the oar out of its mooring, effectively ending
the American's chances.
	   Instead Koven watched as Olympic and 1996 world champion Xeno
Mueller of Switzerland sped past to win the heat in 7:05.61,
followed by Rob Waddell of New Zealand in 7:07.82 and Egypt's Ali
Ibrahim Ali, 5.66 back.
	   ``I was in absolute shock,'' said Koven, who won the world title
in his first season as a single sculler last year. ``I wasn't sure
what was happening at first.
	   ``I was hoping they'd stop the race,'' recalled Koven, who'd
hoped to become the first single sculler since 1990 to successfully
defend his crown. ``If the oar had come out completely within the
first 100m or if I had flipped, the rule is they have to start the
race over. But it came out later, which was unlucky for me.''
	   In the other semifinal Czech Vaclav Chalupa, still looking for
his first world title, finished first in 7:13.12. Slovenia's Iztok
Cop, the 1995 world champion, and Greg Searle of Britain, third at
the last worlds, also advanced to the final.
	   Koven will instead race in the consolation B-final, along with
last year's runnerup Andre Willms of Germany, fourth in his
semifinal.
	   The British coxless foresome, unbeaten as a crew since they
joined forces in May last year, continued their bid for a second
consecutive title, winning their semfinal heat.
	   The crew won comfortably, covering the 2,000m (1.25 mile) course
in 5 minutes, 58.95 seconds, with arch-rivals Australia 1.84 adrift
and Romania a boatlength back.
	   Though Romania and Australia are generally considered the team's
toughest competitors, the 1997 silver and bronze medallists aren't
Redgrave's top concern.
	   ``Romania didn't perform well in their first race,'' said
Redgrave, the only rower to win gold medals in four consecutive
Olympics. ``And the Australians don't seem to be performing as well
as usual.
	   ``Italy, however, seems to be back on form, and it wouldn't
surprise me if they were in the medal hunt,'' added Redgrave. ``The
French will also be a challenge.''
	   In the women's single scull, Russia's Irina Fedotova, who swept
the three World Cup events this year, won her semifinal in 7:55.49.
The Russian will advance to the final with Sweden's Maria Brandin,
the 1997 bronze medallist, and Olympic bronze medallist Trine
Hansen of Denmark,

Keiko, the movie star whale, comes home

	   HEIMAEY, Iceland (AP) _ In a Hollywood-style finish, ``Free
Willy'' star Keiko returned home to the waters of Iceland on
Thursday after 19 years in captivity and a career as a movie star.
	   Hundreds of excited children welcomed the world's most famous
killer whale to town after the U.S. Air Force cargo plane landed on
this windswept archipelago following an eight-hour flight from
Oregon.
	   Keiko's handlers hope his return to Iceland will lead to his
transformation from an aquarium performing animal and movie star to
an animal of the wild again.
	   ``He's fine. It was an absolutely smooth trip. The staff is
euphoric!'' said Diane Hammond, spokeswoman for the Free Willy
Keiko Foundation, when the plane landed.
	   ``For the children of the world, this is a wonderful event and
these airflifters showed that they can take anything anyplace
anytime,'' said Air Force Secretary F. Whitten Peters. He said the
Air Force was proud the mission went so smoothly.
	   The huge plane appeared to land normally in stiff headwinds at
Heimaey's airport, but there was a small problem.
	   ``A piece of the right landing gear failed as the plane
landed,'' said U.S. Air Force spokeswoman Capt. Maria Karl. ``But
the landing itself was very smooth.''
	   A couple of hundred curious townsfolk dotted the landscape as
Keiko's holding tank was maneuvered from the plane to the waiting
flatbed truck with its ``Welcome Home Willy'' banner.
	   The truck with its famous passenger drove into the small town
past throngs of children waving little Icelandic and American flags
and welcoming him with ``Velkommen Keiko'' banners.
	   Some of the youngsters ran alongside the slowly moving truck
under crystal blue skies on a brisk late summer day.
	   Frans Friorikson, age 10, wearing his knitted hat with a stuffed
Keiko sewn to the top, went to the harbor to wave Keiko on.
	   ``It is real exciting,'' he said. ``Keiko is so good for
Iceland.''
	   The whale was loaded onto a barge and floated past spectacular
800-foot (250 meter) volcanic cliffs toward his sea pen in a
protected cove. A flotilla of boats bearing representatives of the
world's media followed him.
	   In the pen, the size of a football field, he will be
reintroduced to the sights and sounds of the waters where he was
captured as a 2-year-old. He will live in his pen, off the rugged
Westmann Islands, until his handlers determine he is able to live
on his own.

Swallows beat BayStars 7-2
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Dwayne Hosey hit a home run in a four-run seventh
inning, leading the Yakult Swallows to a 7-2 victory over the
Central League's front-running Yokohama BayStars at Yokohama
Thursday.
	   Hosey, formerly with the Boston Red Sox, now has 10 homers.
	   The BayStars are still 4 1/2 games ahead of the second-place
Chunichi Dragons who were idle Thursday along with the Hanshin
Tigers.
	   At Tokyo Dome, the Yomiuri Giants edged the Hiroshima Toyo Carp
7-6 and extended their winning streak to six, their longest this
season.
	   In the eighth inning, Hideki Matsui singled home the winning run
following a walk and a single.
	   In the Pacific League, Troy Neel smashed a home run in the
second inning and Hiroshi Kobayashi hurled a two-hitter as the Orix
BlueWave blanked the second-place Seibu Lions 2-0 at Kobe.
	   Neel, formerly with the Oakland Athletics, has 21 homers.
Kobayashi held the Lions hitless before giving up the first hit to
Ken Suzuki in the seventh. He is 9-8.
	   The Lions fell to third place as the Kintetsu Buffaloes, who
were .003 percentage points behind the Lions Wednesday, were idle
Thursday, along with the front-running Nippon Ham Fighters.
	   The Fighters are one game ahead of the second-place Buffaloes
and 1 1/2 games ahead of the Lions.
	   At Chiba, pinch hitter Yukihiko Sato doubled home two runs in
the sixth inning, leading the Chiba Lotte Marines to a 2-1 victory
over the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks.

MacDonalds, upset at recent attacks, maintains heightened security
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ MacDonald's restaurants in Belgium,
shocked by recent attacks against its eateries, said Thursday it
will maintain a heightened level of security at its 62 outlets in
this country.
	   Stefan Gijssels, a spokesman for MacDonald's Belgium Inc., said
a radical animal rights group claimed responsibility for three
cases of arson against the restaurants in Belgium in a letter this
week.
	   In one case, on Aug. 29, a restaurant near the city of Antwerp,
was burned to the ground causing up to 50 millions francs (dlrs up
to 1.4 million) in damage.
	   There have also been three attacks against restaurants of GB
Quick, a chain of Belgian hamburger restaurants. These caused
little damage.
	   Gijssels said the letter from the Animal Liberation Front was
``immediately handed over to the police.''
	   ALF accused MacDonald's of killing animals to make hamburgers.
	   ``That is true, but why attack only us when there so many people
eating meat,'' Gijssels said in a telephone interview.
	   He said he was ``absolutely shocked by the reckless and
irresponsible'' attacks. ``When the first attack occurred, we
increased security'' at the restaurants. ``These measures are
maintained since then and will continue in the future.''
	   Created in London in 1976, ALF has expanded to more than 20
countries, including the United States, Australia, Brazil and
Slovakia where it engages in militant animal rights activities,
including the setting free of animals in fur farms.

Euro 2000 will last three weeks despite earlier concerns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The Euro 2000 tournament will last
for three weeks as originally scheduled despite talk of cutting it
short to limit potential crowd trouble, the Dutch and Belgian
interior ministers agreed Thursday.
	   In the first of a series of meetings leading up to the soccer
championships, Belgian Interior Minister Louis Tobback and his
Dutch counterpart Bram Peper reviewed plans for the tournament to
be jointly hosted by both countries.
	   Although Peper had earlier suggested the idea of shortening the
championships to two weeks, he has now decided to support the
longer duration.
	   ``After looking at all the arguments, it was too complicated to
fit all the games into two weeks,'' said Dutch Interior Ministry
spokeswoman Annette Dijkstra.
	   Thirty-one games are scheduled for the June 2000 tournament,
with 16 nations participating. It is due to be played at eight
venues; four in the Netherlands and four in Belgium.

Paper alleges doctor on anti-doping panel prescribed illegal drugs
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS comments from ex-Festina masseur Voet and cyclist
Virenque starting 10th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A doctor on France's just-installed commission to
examine the use of performance-enhancing drugs in sports allegedly
prescribed illicit drugs to a cyclist ahead of the 1997 Tour de
France, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The 1998 edition of the cycling classic was tainted by a doping
scandal that spurred officials to look for ways to resolve the
widening problem of doping in sports.
	   Le Monde said that Dr. Armand Megret prescribed Diprostene and
Decadron to a cyclist whose name was not revealed.
	   The drugs were placed on a French list of drugs containing
doping substances that was set up in 1994.
	   Megret, questioned by Le Monde, said he ``assumes full
responsibility,'' saying the drugs were supplied to treat a medical
condition.
	   ``I was suffering from bronchitis that I couldn't beat with
antibiotics,'' the cyclist was quoted by the newspaper as saying.
``For the start of the Tour, I absolutely needed to be well.''
	   Megret was quoted as saying that in sports medicine such
prescriptions are sometimes given to treat real ailments. ``That
has nothing to do with the doping that's been going on for the past
two years,'' he was quoted by Le Monde as saying.
	   Megret is on a commission installed Tuesday and set up by Sports
Minister Marie-George Buffet and Health Minister Bernard Kouchner
to ``curb the plague of doping.''
	   The apparently widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs in
sports became clear during the summer's Tour de France. The Festina
team was expelled after its sports director revealed an organized
system of providing drugs to team cyclists. Other teams are under
investigation.
	   Protagonists in the Festina affair are attempting to avoid
blame.
	   Willy Voet, the former Festina masseur arrested when EPO was
found in his car, denied that cyclists could have taken the banned
substance without knowing it, as French cyclist Richard Virenque
claims.
	   When asked about the distribution of drugs at Festina, Voet is
quoted in Thursday's edition of the sports paper L'Equipe as saying
``(team director Bruno) Roussel asked me to do it.''
	   ``It was the doctors who were concerned with that. It's up to
them to sort it out ...,'' Voet said. ``Everything came through the
doctor .... He told me what we had to do.''
	   Virenque said that he was not surprised by Voet's comments.
	   ``That's Willy Voet's case. There is nothing new in his
declarations.''

Pesticides and chemicals are target of new treaty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction from World Wildlife Fund. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Aiming to protect people and the
environment in developing countries, representatives from 80
nations prepared to sign a new treaty Friday that tightens rules on
pesticides and other hazardous chemicals.
	   The international treaty, sponsored by the United Nations'
Environment Program and the Food and Agriculture Organization, will
require companies to get official government permission before
exporting such material.
	   If a country consents, chemical companies will have to provide
information about the potential health and environmental damages of
the product.
	   The accord covers 22 pesticides and five industrial chemicals,
including the pesticide DDT.
	   Currently, there are about 70,000 chemicals on the market. The
treaty is intended to protect developing nations who cannot control
all of the chemicals entering their borders.
	   Many pesticides that are banned or restricted in industrialized
countries, such as DDT, are still being marketed to developing
nations, said Ennelie Kohl of the Dutch environment ministry.
	   ``This treaty is very important, especially for developing
countries,'' Kohl said.
	   The Swiss-based World Wildlife Fund applauded the agreement,
saying it will protect both the environment and the people _ the
farmers, workers and consumers _ in developing countries.
	   ``It's good to see that governments are committed to making
trade in hazardous chemicals a more transparent, informed,
consensual process,'' said Clifton Curtis, toxic campaigns director
for the WWF.
	   But the group warned that the treaty will be ineffective for
developing countries that produce their own hazardous chemicals or
lack effective regulations.
	   The WWF also urged governments to make a global commitment to
phasing out and eliminating the most hazardous chemicals and
pesticides.
	   Developing countries made a strong showing at a treaty
conference which began Thursday. All African countries were
represented, Kohl said, and almost all of them sent ministers to
sign the agreement on Friday.
	   After the representatives sign the treaty, a minimum of 50
countries must then ratify it before it can take effect.

Iran schedules more military exercises near Afghan border
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran said Thursday it will hold a second set
of military exercises on its border with Afghanistan as tensions
increased over Iranian diplomats missing in the neighboring
country.
	   Maj. Gen. Ali Shahbazi, Iran's army chief of staff, said the new
exercises will be ``unprecedented in terms of scope and variety of
operations'' and will include artillery units and armored units. He
did not give a starting date.
	   Some 70,000 elite Iranian soldiers _ backed by tanks and
helicopter gun ships _ held three days of maneuvers near the border
earlier this month in a show of strength against Afghanistan.
	   He added that the maneuvers were ``inevitable, considering the
increased security disturbances on our eastern borders.''
	   Iran accuses the Taliban religious militia, which controls most
of Afghanistan, of holding some 70 Iranians, including 11
diplomats. The militia, which accused the Iranians of aiding
opposition forces, denies any knowledge of the diplomats.
	   The U.N. Security Council has urged Afghanistan to give the
Iranians safe passage out of the country.
	   Earlier this week, the U.S. State Department expressed concern
about rising tensions between Iran and Afghanistan and urged both
sides to exercise restraint.
	   The statement came after U.S. intelligence officials warned that
Iran had not moved its troops after the first set of maneuvers and
appeared poised to invade.
	   Anger has been rising in Tehran since Aug. 8, when the Taliban
militia overran the city of Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan
and the 11 Iranian diplomats and a journalist went missing.
	   The Iranians later said that a number of Iranian drivers also
were being held by the Taliban.
	   On Thursday, Iranian radio said that the leader of the Taliban _
Mullah Mohammed Omar _ personally ordered his forces to detain the
Iranian diplomats and the journalist.
	   The agency, quoting unidentified but ``informed'' sources, said
that Omar ordered 15 armed men to enter the Iranian consulate in
Mazar-e-Sharif to take them as ``hostages.''
	   Meanwhile, Ghorbanali Dorri Najafabadi, Iran's intelligence
minister, said he had information that Taliban forces had entered
the consulate with the help of Pakistani intelligence forces.
	   He repeated Iran's earlier assertion that it ``will use any
means to save the diplomats' lives.''

Russians ambivalent about Yeltsin's latest nomination
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Politics &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin's decision to promote his foreign
minister to prime minister earned quick plaudits from politicos.
But on the street, the nomination of Yevgeny Primakov drew more
skepticism than approval.
	   ``He wasn't bad as a foreign minister, but what's his program?''
asked coal miner Konstantin Gormotov, picketing outside the
government's headquarters. ``He's got no idea how to get Russia out
of its crisis.''
	   Parliament is scheduled to vote Friday on Primakov's nomination,
and most factions have said he will be quickly approved. One of his
strongest points among both lawmakers and the public is that he has
remained aloof from the bickering between the president and
parliament.
	   ``He's a centrist,'' said Vladimir Murashov, a businessman.
``You see what the rest of them did _ they destroyed our country. I
don't think there's any other choice, and I expect he'll work out
some sort of synthesis between the communists and the reformers.''
	   Many Russians interviewed were simply relieved that Yeltsin's
previous nominee, Viktor Chernomyrdin, had stepped aside.
	   ``I expect fresh decisions from (Primakov),'' said Vladimir
Strekalov, a farming equipment specialist. ``Chernomyrdin was paid
off by the mafia. But Primakov is a dark horse who doesn't have so
many interests and isn't going to protect anybody.''
	   Still, some Muscovites consider Primakov tainted by his long
association with Yeltsin.
	   ``How old is Primakov? Sixty-eight?'' asked Gormotov, the miner.
``Soon he'll get sick, something will go wrong with his heart, or
his head. Why are all our leaders practically in their seventies?
There are plenty of young talented people. Yeltsin's just shuffling
around his own team.''
	   But for the most part, Russians said they care more about ending
the country's turmoil and less about who is prime minister.
	   ``Those politicians, they just decide everything among
themselves,'' said Vladimir Giltaichuk, a driver. ``They're not
going to listen to me anyway. But who cares if it's Chernomyrdin,
or (former prime minister) Kiriyenko, or Primakov? I'd just like to
be able to fed my family.''

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes blasted suspected
guerrilla hideouts in southern Lebanon on Thursday after guerrillas
killed four pro-Israeli militiamen.
	   Earlier, Lebanese anti-aircraft guns opened fire on eight
Israeli jets as they flew low over Beirut, rattling windows as one
fighter broke the sound barrier twice.
	   Witnesses said they saw no sign of the planes being hit.
	   The flight over the Lebanese capital appeared to be an Israeli
show of force after a second roadside bombing in two days killed
members of its South Lebanon Army allies.
	   Two Israeli jets fired a missile each at guerrilla targets
outside the southern town of Mashghara at 2:30 p.m. (1130GMT),
Lebanese security officials said.
	   The jets returned about an hour later and fired two more
missiles at guerrilla infiltration trails in a mountainous area
near Jezzine, a town about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of
Beirut, the officials said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   There was no word on casualties from the air strikes.
	   The jets appeared to be pursuing guerrillas who had detonated a
roadside bomb that killed four SLA militiamen about three hours
earlier.
	   Black smoke billowed from the area which is over the mountains
from the bombing site outside Jezzine, which is controlled by SLA
militiamen.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman said warplanes struck
``terrorist targets'' in southern Lebanon. He confirmed reports
from Lebanese security officials that four SLA militiamen were
killed in the bombing.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah group said its guerrillas had
carried out Thursday's attack on a militia vehicle.
	   On Wednesday a Hezbollah bomb killed two militiamen and wounded
five others.

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ While fighting raged in Congo,
African and U.N. leaders made a renewed effort Thursday to achieve
a cease-fire despite three previous failures.
	   Rebels trying to oust Congolese President Laurent Kabila were
not invited, said Ibrahim Dagash, spokesman of the Organization of
African Unity, host of the latest round of peace talks.
	   A Congolese rebel delegation stormed out of negotiations Tuesday
in Zimbabwe, just before a draft of a cease-fire agreement was
expected to be signed. Fighting immediately surged in eastern
Congo.
	   Rebel-run Radio Bukavu said insurgents and government-backed
militiamen clashed near Bukava, a lakeside town on the border with
Rwanda.
	   Refugees fleeing across Lake Tanganyika to Tanzania told U.N.
workers that the government recaptured the southeastern town of
Kalemie on Wednesday.
	   Neither report could be confirmed independently.
	   Although the rebels left the Zimbabwe summit, neighboring
countries embroiled in the Congolese conflict agreed to try to work
out a cease-fire, withdrawal of foreign troops and political reform
in Congo.
	   The rebels trying to unseat Congo's year-old government claim
Kabila has failed to implement democratic reforms and has worsened
ethnic hatred.
	   Kabila's government asked Zimbabwe to arrest eight Congolese
rebels who flew to Victoria Falls for the abortive peace talks on
Tuesday, the Financial Gazette reported Thursday. Justice Minister
Emmerson Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe had no jurisdiction to so so.
	   Among those attending the two-day peace conference, which began
Thursday afternoon, were government ministers of Zimbabwe, Angola
and Namibia, whose armies have backed Kabila. Congo also sent its
defense minister.
	   Also participating were the representatives of Uganda and
Rwanda, which supported Kabila's ouster of dictator Mobutu Sese
Seko. Kabila claims they are now supporting the rebels, but Rwanda
denies the charge. Uganda admits it has troops in Congo, but says
they are only protecting its borders from attack by Ugandan rebels.
	   Zambia, which has remained neutral, sent its defense minister.
	   OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim and a team of U.N.
advisers also were involved.
	   ``What we see is a process moving in the right direction, and
the secretary-general wants to offer whatever support he can,''
Fred Eckhard, a spokesman for U.N. chief Kofi Annan said Wednesday.
	   The failed summit in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe marked the third
formal attempt at a peace deal since the conflict began Aug. 2, and
the only time rebels were invited.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Tokyo court on Thursday shaved six months off a
seven-year jail term for a doomsday cult member convicted of
helping abduct a man who later died, Japanese media reports said.
	   The cult's guru and other leaders have been charged with murder
in the March 1995 gas attack on Tokyo subways that killed 12 people
and sickened thousands.
	   In Thursday's ruling, the Tokyo High Court heard the appeal by
37-year old Eriko Iida, who had agreed to make compensation
payments to another kidnapping victim of the Aum Shinri Kyo cult,
the reports said.
	   It is not unusual for Japanese courts to mitigate punishment for
acts of contrition. The maximum penalty for abduction in Japan is
15 years in prison.
	   Court officials were not available for comment late Thursday.
	   Iida was initially sentenced two years ago in two kidnappings _
one in 1994 and another in 1995 of a man who had been trying to
help his sister leave the cult.
	   Prosecutors say that man died after being heavily drugged by
other cult members.

Britain leaves gap for Yugoslav airline to avoid EU ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union struggled Thursday
to paper over holes torn in its efforts to forge a united foreign
policy by Britain's decision to allow Yugoslavia's national airline
to fly into London despite an EU ban.
	   ``It is a crazy situation ... which weakens our position,''
Germany's State Secretary for Foreign Affairs Werner Hoyer told
reporters. ``If we don't show a strong common will, we won't be
taken seriously.''
	   EU leaders ordered the ban at a summit in June in response to
the crackdown by Serbian troops against ethnic Albanian separatists
in Kosovo province,
	   The EU introduced the ban Tuesday, supposedly putting airports
in all 15 EU nations out of bounds to Yugoslav planes.
	   But Britain, citing a 1959 air agreement with Yugoslavia, said
it will have to allow the national carrier JAT to continue flights
for another 12 months.
	   On Wednesday, the European Commission's legal experts began
studying the case to see if Britain was in breach of EU law while
other officials tried to put on a brave face.
	   The EU executive argued the incomplete ban succeeded in putting
pressure on Milosevic, despite the unbroken access for JAT daily
flights into London's Heathrow airport, Europe's busiest.
	   ``The affair is a little complicated, legally speaking,'' said
EU spokeswoman Martine Reicherts. ``The political message is
completely clear.''
	   British diplomats insisted their government supported the flight
ban and had stopped Yugoslav charter flights, but claimed Britain
would break international law if it failed to give JAT a year's
notice of cancellation of the air deal.
	   The Yugoslav carrier was considering legal action against other
EU nations which had imposed the ban in violation of similar air
access agreements. Officials said Spain, Belgium and Greece have
also not yet enforced the ban, but were expected to do so shortly.
	   In Belgrade, JAT said it had been obliged to halt flights to
Germany, Austria, Italy, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands and
would stop flying to France from Friday.

Media group confirms talks with Arsenal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new Wenger quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ First Manchester United, now Arsenal.
	   One day after United's board accepted a record dlrs 1 billion
takeover bid from Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB television, Arsenal said
Thursday it was in negotiations with another media group.
	   Arsenal and Carlton Communications issued statements saying they
were in preliminary discussions. They gave no details of the talks
or whether they involved the possible purchase of the reigning
Premier League and FA Cup champions.
	   ``We have discussed with Arsenal Football Club a range of ways
in which our two companies could work together,'' a Carlton
statement said. ``These discussions are at an early stage.''
	   Arsenal's statement said, ``The board of Arsenal FC confirm that
it has held preliminary discussions with Carlton Communications Plc
concerning a range of ways in which the two companies might work
together. These discussions are at an early stage.''
	   The London Evening Standard said the talks involved a possible
275-million-pound (dlrs 459.2 million) takeover. The paper said
negotiations to buy Arsenal ``have been under way for some time but
a deal is not believed imminent.''
	   The announcement came a day after the board of Manchester United
accepted a 623-million-pound (dlrs 1 billion) bid from BSkyB, the
highest amount ever paid for a sports franchise.
	   The Manchester United takeover, which still needs approval by
the club's shareholders and government regulators, sparked
speculation of the possibility of a series of takeovers of soccer
teams by media companies.
	   ``After yesterday's Manchester United deal, the big clubs are
realizing it is better to pick your partner and be one of the first
in, rather than hang around,'' said William Davies, a soccer
analyst with London stockbroker Albert E. Sharp.
	   While some Manchester United fans have vowed to fight the
proposed Murdoch takeover, there was a sense of inevitability among
Arsenal fans gathered outside the club's Highbury stadium Thursday
in north London.
	   ``I suppose now that Manchester United have done it, we have to
as well,'' teenage student Lynette Dowden said. ``But it's all
about money these days. It's not the football that matters any
more.''
	   Shelley Johnson, a 21-year-old student teacher, concurred.
	   ``I don't particularly like it, but if Manchester United get all
the money from Sky they might run away with everything. We've got
to compete somehow.''
	   Along with Manchester United and Liverpool, Arsenal is one of
the clubs which could take part in a proposed European Super League
starting in 2000.
	   A lucrative takeover could help the club finance a new stadium
to replace Highbury, which has a capacity of just 38,000 and is
considered too small to meet current demand.
	   The current Arsenal team is coached by Frenchman Arsene Wenger
and features a lineup of international stars including Dutch
striker Dennis Bergkamp and French World Cup winners Patrick Vieira
and Emmanuel Petit.
	   Wenger said Thursday he was unaware of the talks with Carlton
but understood if fans were worried about the prospect of their
club being run by a media company.
	   ``Their concern is that the people who own their club should
also love it,'' he said. ``They don't want it to just become a
business. It is the history of football in England that club owners
are in the game for things other than business reasons, but the
game is changing all the time of course.''
	   Wenger warned that smaller clubs could be left out if England's
elite teams are bought up by the media.
	   ``The worry is that the rules of the game could change if four
or five clubs have owners from the media,'' he said. ``They would
have the power to make life really impossible for the other
teams.''

Student shot, but protests, hysteria strengthen against Hun Sen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS for AMs. UPDATES with student's condition, second
unearthed body, other details.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Police turned out in force and shot
a demonstrator at pointblank range Thursday, but more than 6,000
people marched through the streets in a show of defiance against
strongman Hun Sen.
	   The protest was a backlash against four days of ruthless police
action to suppress weeks of relatively peaceful calls for Hun Sen's
ouster following disputed elections July 26. Far from crushing
opposition to his 13-year rule, the crackdown has widened it.
	   ``The demonstration comes out of our hearts,'' said one
protester, Penn Chan, 27. ``More and more people are coming out
because people have died.''
	   A hysteria of rumors swept the capital.
	   Medical students said that seven Buddhist monks were trapped at
their school by police and beaten, and at least one beheaded.
Human-rights workers were denied access to the school for half an
hour by police, then scoured the area seeking evidence. None was
immediately found.
	   Only one person, a motorcycle taxi driver shot in the head by
police Monday, has been confirmed killed.
	   But many have been hit by gunfire, including at least two
Buddhist monks, and scores injured by police using clubs, cattle
prods, rifle butts and water cannon.
	   Belief is widespread that several Buddhist monks were killed
Wednesday when a protest outside the U.S. Embassy and the nearby
home of opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh was smashed. An
exhaustive search of hospitals and morgues produced no bodies.
	   Human-rights workers unearthed two bodies from a shallow grave
near the airport Thursday. One was a 19-year-old man shot in the
abdomen and beaten until his skull was destroyed. The other had
been riddled with bullets. They appeared to have been killed
Wednesday.
	   A few hundred motorcycle taxi drivers and students, core
supporters of Ranariddh and ally Sam Rainsy, gathered again
Thursday outside the embassy. Police arrived shortly afterward,
destroying a makeshift shrine erected to honor the monks attacked
the day before.
	   A few rocks were thrown and five police fired Kalashnikov
rifles, two of them aiming directly into the crowd.
	   An 18-year-old student, Tour Khunnaruth, was struck in the neck.
His spine was fractured and doctors feared he could be paralyzed
from the neck down. His mother fainted when speaking to The
Associated Press.
	   The protesters, who move quickly about the city on small
motorbikes, played cat-and-mouse with the police for several hours
until settling near the Angkor-style Independence Monument.
	   As rain poured, they began a slow procession through the city,
chanting ``Peace! Peace!'' and ``Hang the Yuon!'' a derogatory term
for Vietnamese.
	   Many Cambodians view Hun Sen, who came to power during the harsh
10-year Vietnamese occupation of their country, and his security
forces as tools of Hanoi.
	   They passed by the National Assembly and piles of dirt in a park
across the street, all that remains of a protest camp known
Democracy Square destroyed by police Tuesday.
	   In an unexpected outpouring of public support, the march built
up strength from a few hundred to more than 6,000 as bystanders
joined in. They were applauded and cheered from balconies and
storefronts as they filed through the city.
	   Police left them largely unmolested for about two hours until
they massed again at the Independence Monument, when about 150
elite Flying Tiger police arrived, joined by 150 police on
motorcycles, soldiers in trucks and four water cannon.
	   They circled the crowd, then started moving toward it. The
marchers scattered into a nearby park and toward the Mekong river.
No shots were fired and the police did not use clubs, but instead
followed clusters of protesters in what appeared attempt to
intimidate them.
	   Eventually, the police seemed to tire of the game and left. The
marchers regathered at Independence Monument and cheered what they
considered a victory.
	   ``If we're afraid, we'll never find peace,'' said Vann Heng, 18.
``This could be the last chance we have to express our opinions.''
	   Kem Sokha, an opposition legislator and chairman of the National
Assembly's human-rights committee, was stopped from taking a flight
out of the country. Hun Sen has barred several opponents from
leaving. They describe themselves as hostages.
	   The Association of Southeast Asian Nations urged both sides to
``exercise restraint, avoid violence, including extremists acts''
and expressed fears regional stability was in jeopardy.
	   Hun Sen won a parliamentary majority but lacks the two-thirds
needed to form a new government. The opposition alleges massive
electoral fraud and is withholding support.
	   ASEAN postponed Cambodia's membership after Hun Sen deposed
Ranariddh in a coup last year. The violence this week has been the
worst since then, undermining the new legitimacy Hun Sen was
seeking from the election.

Havel cleared by doctors to visit the U.S.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel has been
cleared by his medical team to leave for an official visit to
Washington starting Sep. 15, his personal doctor announced
Thursday.
	   Havel, 61, fought off a life-threatening case of pneumonia in
August and had an emergency surgery for a ruptured colon in
February.
	   A former chain smoker and veteran of communist jails, Havel has
been hospitalized five times since December 1996 when a third of
his lung and a cancerous tumor were removed.
	   ``Mr. Havel underwent a complex medical check which proved his
condition is stabilized,'' Dr. Ilja Kotik said in a statement faxed
to The Associated Press.
	   Havel is scheduled to meet with top U.S. officials including
President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright.
	   Three members of the president's medical team will travel with
him and the schedule foresees three hours of rest every day.

US reigning world champ Koven thwarted by tiny screw
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ Reigning champion James Koven of the
United States saw his bid to defend his single scull crown thwarted
by a tiny screw Thursday, at the world rowing championships.
	   In sharp contrast, a finely-tuned British team enjoyed a banner
day, qualifying six more crews for the finals, spearheaded by their
coxless four of Steve Redgrave, Matthew Pinsent, James Cracknell
and Tim Foster.
	   Koven's semifinal effort began to unravel barely 100m (110
yards) into the 2,000m (1.25 mile) race, the screw in his oar-lock
loosening, allowing his oar to slip dangerously. A choppy wave at
about 250m knocked the oar out of its mooring, effectively ending
the American's chances.
	   Instead Koven watched as Olympic and 1996 world champion Xeno
Mueller of Switzerland sped past to win the heat in 7:05.61,
followed by Rob Waddell of New Zealand in 7:07.82 and Egypt's Ali
Ibrahim Ali, 5.66 back.
	   ``I was in absolute shock,'' said Koven, who won the world title
in his first season as a single sculler last year. ``I wasn't sure
what was happening at first.
	   ``I was hoping they'd stop the race,'' recalled Koven, who'd
hoped to become the first single sculler since 1990 to successfully
defend his crown. ``If the oar had come out completely within the
first 100m or if I had flipped, the rule is they have to start the
race over. But it came out later, which was unlucky for me.''
	   In the other semifinal Czech Vaclav Chalupa, still looking for
his first world title, finished first in 7:13.12. Slovenia's Iztok
Cop, the 1995 world champion, and Greg Searle of Britain, third at
the last worlds, also advanced to the final.
	   Koven will instead race in the consolation B-final, along with
last year's runnerup Andre Willms of Germany, fourth in his
semifinal.
	   The British coxless foresome, unbeaten as a crew since they
joined forces in May last year, continued their bid for a second
consecutive title, winning their semfinal heat.
	   The crew won comfortably, covering the 2,000m (1.25 mile) course
in 5 minutes, 58.95 seconds, with arch-rivals Australia 1.84 adrift
and Romania a boatlength back.
	   Though Romania and Australia are generally considered the team's
toughest competitors, the 1997 silver and bronze medallists aren't
Redgrave's top concern.
	   ``Romania didn't perform well in their first race,'' said
Redgrave, the only rower to win gold medals in four consecutive
Olympics. ``And the Australians don't seem to be performing as well
as usual.
	   ``Italy, however, seems to be back on form, and it wouldn't
surprise me if they were in the medal hunt,'' added Redgrave. ``The
French will also be a challenge.''
	   In the women's single scull, Russia's Irina Fedotova, who swept
the three World Cup events this year, won her semifinal in 7:55.49.
The Russian will advance to the final with Sweden's Maria Brandin,
the 1997 bronze medallist, and Olympic bronze medallist Trine
Hansen of Denmark.

Nazi war crimes trial postponed indefinitely

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ A court on Thursday ordered an
indefinite postponement in the Nazi war-crimes trial of Aleksandras
Lileikis, who his lawyers say is too ill to attend the proceedings.
	   The court said it would appoint a medical commission to
determine if the 91-year-old Lileikis is too sick to speak in his
own defense.
	   The trial was to have opened Wednesday, after a number of delays
that prompted criticism from Jewish groups who contend that
Lithuanian authorities are trying to draw out the procedures until
Lileikis dies.
	   The trial was postponed for one day on Wednesday after Lileikis'
attorneys said he was hospitalized. On Thursday, the court accepted
a hospital report saying he suffers from a number of ailments,
including poor circulation to the brain.
	   If the commission determines that Lileikis is unable to speak in
his own defense, the trial likely would never be held. Lileikis
could be tried in absentia only if were trying to unlawfully evade
trial, or if he were abroad and refused to return to Lithuania, the
three-judge panel said Thursday.
	   Lileikis, who was head of the Vilnius security police during the
1941-44 Nazi occupation, is charged with genocide for allegedly
ordering scores of Jews to be arrested and handed over to a Nazi
execution squad.
	   About 90 percent of Lithuania's prewar Jewish population of
240,000 died during the Nazi occupation.
	   Lileikis emigrated in 1955 to the United States, and lived in
Norwood, Massachusetts, where he worked for a Lithuanian publishing
house.
	   Based on documents that came to light after the dissolution of
the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States began steps to revoke
Lileikis' citizenship on the grounds that he lied about his past.
	   Lileikis returned to Lithuania in 1996, but it was not until
early this year that he was charged. Jewish groups have accused
Lithuanian authorities of dragging their feet in hopes of avoiding
a trial.
	   The criticism continued on Thursday, with Efriam Zuroff of the
Nazi-hunting Simon Wiesenthal Center asking ``If Lileikis feels
innocent, why doesn't he come here and prove it?''
	   But spectator Petras Cidzikas, reflecting the views of many,
said he was pleased that the proceedings against Lileikis could be
over.
	   ``I believe this is the last sitting of this shameful trial,''
he said.

German Unity Day musical program to include East German anthem
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Organizers of this year's German Unity
Day celebration refused Thursday to back off a decision to include
part of former East Germany's national anthem in the musical
program, despite charges of ``tastelessness'' by the federal
government.
	   A nine-note passage from the defunct communist state's anthem
shows up three times in the composition commissioned for the Oct. 3
festivities marking Germany's 1990 reunification, to be held this
year in the Lower Saxony state capital of Hanover.
	   Federal government spokesman Otto Hauser said including the
passage would mock the memory of all those who suffered under East
Germany's oppressive government, and that ``one should stay away
from this tastelessness.''
	   State officials, though, said the 15-minute composition by Bardo
Henning would be played as planned. The piece also includes
passages from Germany's own national anthem and a hymn sung by
concentration camp inmates.
	   ``We have the composition, and we are the organizers,'' said
Lower Saxony's interior minister, Gerhard Glogowski. ``I'm
expecting a real nice party.''
	   Czech President Vaclav Havel is to give the keynote speech.
Closing out the festivities will be a rock concert with German
bands, including the heavy-metal Scorpions.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Yevgeny Primakov, a 68-year-old academic who once
commanded a vast Soviet espionage empire and survived repeated
Kremlin intrigues, now faces the toughest task of his life _
pulling Russia out of a deep economic crisis.
	   Named by President Boris Yeltsin to head the new Cabinet and
expected to easily win parliamentary approval, Primakov is known as
a low-key but skillful administrator and diplomat respected by
hard-liners and liberals alike.
	   Primakov has served as Russia's foreign minister since the
beginning of 1996, staunchly defending his country's interests and
winning admiration even from Western leaders who are not
particularly fond of his policies.
	   But almost nothing is known about his plans for reviving
Russia's feeble economy. He has rarely expressed views on Russian
domestic matters, apart from some nationalist complaints that the
huge country must not simply become a source of raw materials for
the West.
	   Russia's divided politicians praise Primakov as a compromise
figure. Unlike his acting predecessor Viktor Chernomyrdin, he is
considered ``clean,'' without links to political parties or the
often corrupt industrial managers and bankers.
	   In the West, Primakov is best known as the man who negotiated
with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in December 1990 and January 1991
in a vain attempt to avert the Gulf War. Primakov, a Arab
specialist, made several trips to Baghdad seeking what he called a
``face-saving'' way for Saddam to withdraw from occupied Kuwait.
	   Primakov has a cordial, but cool stance toward the West, saying
Russia must not be guided by foreign powers and advocating the
concept of a ``multipolar'' world.
	   ``There's an effort ... to make the world unipolar'' and
centering around the United States, he wrote in a 1996 article.
``The world should be based on the interests of many states. In a
multipolar world Russia has to be one of the poles and not join the
others.''
	   Primakov has clashed with Western politicians on several issues
in recent years.
	   He has favored moves toward easing international sanctions on
Iraq, he often disagreed with Western policies during the war in
the former Yugoslavia, and he's a staunch opponent of NATO's
expansion into central and eastern Europe.
	   Primakov also has tried to bring Russia closer to Asian giants
such as China and India to counterbalance U.S. global influence,
and to revive Moscow's ties with traditional Soviet clients in the
Middle East, such as Syria and Iraq.
	   Despite his wary stance toward the West, he's seen as a
pragmatist who maintains friendly relations with Western
politicians.
	   Primakov was born in October 1929 in Kiev, Ukraine, and
graduated from Moscow's prestigious Eastern Studies Institute. He
worked as a broadcast journalist in 1956, and from 1962-70 was a
correspondent for the Soviet Communist Party newspaper, Pravda,
based in Arab countries.
	   He was named director of his former alma mater in 1977, and
became head of the World Economics and International Relations
Institute in 1985.
	   A longtime Communist Party member, Primakov rose to become an
alternate member of the ruling Politburo in 1989 and held a variety
of senior posts in the Soviet parliament.
	   Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev made Primakov one of his
closest aides during the reform period of the late 1980s,
appointing him a special foreign policy advisor in 1990. Shortly
before the failed 1991 hard-line coup, he reportedly warned
Gorbachev not to trust the KGB.
	   Primakov denounced the putsch and was soon named first deputy
KGB chief, formally embarking on a career as a spymaster.
	   He was put in charge of Soviet foreign intelligence at the end
of 1991, later heading Russia's new Foreign Intelligence Service,
and was named foreign minister in January 1996. Unlike many of
Gorbachev's former allies, Primakov managed to develop and maintain
a close relationship with Yeltsin.
	   ``We have not heard him utter assurances about his love for the
president, or oaths of loyalty to reforms, or bombastic patriotic
speeches,'' columnist Alexander Minkin wrote recently in Novaya
Gazeta.
	   ``But nobody has doubts that he protects the country's interests
as he understands them, every time the country gives him the
slightest opportunity to do so.''

Italian government considers amnesty in ``Clean Hands'' cases
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Trying to come up with a way to deal with a
staggering number of corruption trials, leaders of Italy's
governing center-left coalition met Thursday to consider amnesty
for anyone who confesses.
	   Thousands of politicians, businessmen and government bureaucrats
have been implicated in the corruption scandal that began in 1992
with probes by Milan's ``Clean Hands'' prosecutors and developed
nationwide into the ``Tangentopoli'' (Bribesville) investigations.
	   Now, with prosecutors buried under mounds of documentation in
thousands of cases and fears that the statute of limitations in
some instances might run out, both the government and the
opposition want trials speeded up.
	   But the two sides remain at odds over how to do it.
	   Justice Minister Giovanni Flick on Wednesday proposed offering
full or partial amnesty to anyone who confesses to corruption.
Under his plan, those who confess would either be exempt from jail,
serve leaner terms or be put under house arrest.
	   Flick also proposed that those who admit to corruption be barred
from public office for at least five years.
	   The center-right opposition immediately rejected the Flick
proposals and called on Parliament to set up a special commission
to explore the issue.
	   The opposition says there is nothing in the plan to deal with
the issue of ongoing corruption, which was exposed to be systematic
among politicians and businessmen.
	   The opposition leader is Silvio Berlusconi, the ex-premier and
media mogul who has been convicted of corruption in three cases. He
is appealing the convictions.
	   A commentary in one of Italy's leading dailies, Corriere della
Sera, cautioned about rushing to close the books on the scandal.
	   ```If nothing has changed, why close a chapter of our past that
is so recent it still threatens our future,'' wrote commentator
Giuseppe D'Avanzo.
	   Premier Romano Prodi's government discussed the proposal for
nearly two hours trying to make it palatable to both the coalition
and the opposition. Among those at the meeting were leaders of
Communist Refoundation.
	   The Communists, outside of the majority, give Prodi the majority
he needs in the lower Chamber of Deputies. Prodi has a comfortable
majority in the Senate.
	   Any type of amnesty law must be approved by two-thirds of
Parliament, which means the government needs at least some support
from the opposition.

Japan's premier outlines twin plans for economic revitalization
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's prime minister outlined a set of economic
proposals Thursday designed to revitalize the country's
recession-hit industries and uplift living standards for the
average Japanese.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi unveiled the plans after a meeting
of a special economic strategy task force which drafted the
recommendations. The centerpiece of the package is a vaguely worded
proposal for doubling the amount of housing, working and recreation
space within five years.
	   ``We have been looking for ideas to overcome the current, very
severe economic conditions and create a brighter future,'' Obuchi
said in a statement.
	   The twin plans are a key part of the embattled Obuchi
administration's answer to mounting concern over the outlook for
the Japanese economy, which shows few signs of pulling out of a
prolonged slump, and longstanding quality of life issues in crowded
Japan.
	   The recommendations are to be implemented through government
spending and as yet unspecified deregulatory efforts, the prime
minister said.
	   On Friday, the Cabinet was expected to formally instruct
government agencies and ministries to begin fleshing out the still
sketchy details in their budgetary requests for the fiscal year
beginning in April.
	   In addition to expanding areas for work and play in a nation
accustomed to cramped apartments and offices, the effort aims to
increase the number of new jobs by 500,000 in the next two years
and improve industrial productivity.
	   Obuchi's proposals resemble government goals laid out in a
five-year plan approved in 1992 that promised to turn Japan into a
``lifestyle superpower'' _ an attempt to deal with complaints that
living standards have not kept pace with economic growth.
	   But the highly-touted plan, recommended by a special advisory
panel to then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, was later abandoned
mid-stream after many of its goals appeared unlikely to be met.
Miyazawa now serves as finance minister in the Obuchi Cabinet.
	   The new ``lifestyle space doubling plan'' also evokes another
famous five-year plan in Japan _ former Prime Minister Hayato
Ikeda's successful 1960 ``Income Doubling Plan.''
	   Many Japanese are increasingly unnerved by issues such as job
security and wage stagnation. Unemployment has topped a record 4
percent.
	   The Labor Ministry said Thursday that summer bonuses paid by
major companies fell an average 0.98 percent on the year, Kyodo
News reported.
	   The plans' recommendations were made by Obuchi's newly
established Economic Strategy Council, a 10-member Japanese version
of the United States' Council of Economic Advisers.
	   The panel is dominated by leading academics and business leaders
such as Hiroshi Okuda, president of Toyota Motor Corp.

McDonald's, upset at recent attacks, maintains heightened security
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RETRANSMITTING to correct name of restaurant &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ McDonald's restaurants in Belgium,
shocked by recent attacks against its eateries, said Thursday it
will maintain a heightened level of security at its 62 outlets in
this country.
	   Stefan Gijssels, a spokesman for McDonald's Belgium Inc., said a
radical animal rights group claimed responsibility for three cases
of arson against the restaurants in Belgium in a letter this week.
	   In one case, on Aug. 29, a restaurant near the city of Antwerp,
was burned to the ground causing up to 50 millions francs (dlrs up
to 1.4 million) in damage.
	   There have also been three attacks against restaurants of GB
Quick, a chain of Belgian hamburger restaurants. These caused
little damage.
	   Gijssels said the letter from the Animal Liberation Front was
``immediately handed over to the police.''
	   ALF accused McDonald's of killing animals to make hamburgers.
	   ``That is true, but why attack only us when there so many people
eating meat,'' Gijssels said in a telephone interview.
	   He said he was ``absolutely shocked by the reckless and
irresponsible'' attacks. ``When the first attack occurred, we
increased security'' at the restaurants. ``These measures are
maintained since then and will continue in the future.''
	   Created in London in 1976, ALF has expanded to more than 20
countries, including the United States, Australia, Brazil and
Slovakia where it engages in militant animal rights activities,
including the setting free of animals in fur farms.

Residents of island off Khartoum struggling to save homes

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ While thousands of Sudanese have fled
their homes to escape the Nile's flood waters, inhabitants of a
river island are stubbornly piling up sandbags to save hundreds of
years of family heritage.
	   Men, women and children are working to shore up a line of
sandbags stretching 4 kilometers (2 1/2 miles) long and 2 1/2
meters (8 feet) high along the shore of Tuti Island in the Blue
Nile just off Khartoum.
	   ``This is how we are surviving. For us, Tuti is our lives, our
ancestor. ... It is our home,'' said Abdul-Rahman Jibril, 56, a
farmer.
	   The 950-acre (380-hectare) island is home to about 25,000 people
who first built their sandbag barrier for floods in 1988. The White
and Blue Niles, which converge just north of Tuti, repeatedly have
sent destructive floods into Sudan in the past half century.
	   On Thursday, the rivers' levels already were above the worst
floods in 1988, which caused dlrs 300 million in damage.
	   Tuti's long-established community stands in contrast to many
homes and shacks along the Nile south of Khartoum _ many of them
rented _ where more than 200,000 people have been driven out by the
rising waters.
	   This year's flood already has caused 40 billion Sudanese pounds
(dlrs 19 million) in damage to homes and farms, and the government
has mobilized military reservists to help battle what it fears
could be Sudan's worst flooding ever.
	   Sharaf Eddin Banaga, a state minister for housing and
engineering, says the government also is trying to convince people
along the river to move permanently to higher ground to try to end
``this vicious circle of floods and destruction.''
	   But residents of Tuti Island _ which sits about 100 meters
(yards) off Khartoum _ will not listen to government pleas to
relocate.
	   Zeia al-Abdin al-Burai, an accountant and island resident, said
the islanders resisted British efforts to move elsewhere during
colonial rule in the 1940s.
	   ``We are not leaving our soul and history. ... Seven to 10
generations of grandfathers lived here,'' he said.
	   Sabah el-Khair Abdul Awi, 72 and one of the oldest residents,
said the islanders trace their heritage to four families who
settled on Tuti 700 years ago.
	   Life on the island also has taught Tuti's residents much about
surviving floods.
	   Thus early Tuesday morning, when the alarm was sounded from the
mosque that flood waters broke through part of the dike, thousands
turned out to shore up the flood barrier. Now, the residents are
keeping watch and throwing on more sandbags as needed against the
rising waters.
	   Some 90 of the island's homes in low-lying areas have been
abandoned. Since the island consists of large, extended families,
those driven out have moved in with relatives. Tuti's remaining
3,000 homes still are protected by the dike.
	   Men are working in shorts or with their traditional galabiya
robes hitched above the knees to keep the barrier intact, and women
are outdoors cooking for those doing the sandbagging.
	   ``A single centimeter and all our efforts will be washed away,''
Abdul-Rahim Siraj el-Nour, a banker who lives on the island, said
Wednesday.
	   Dr. Firial Omer, a Tuti resident and a physician at Khartoum
Hospital, said she feared problems with mosquitoes and malaria once
the flooding subsided. But she, too, said Tuti's people would not
leave the island.
	   ``There will be damage,'' she said. ``But if we survive, we will
come out stronger.''

	   MOSTAR, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ To ensure a peaceful election
this weekend, police are cracking down on Bosnian Serb, Croat and
Muslim crime bosses in hopes of reducing their grip on political
and economic power in southern Bosnia.
	   ``We have increased police activities in the light of the coming
elections,'' said Sefkija Dziho, deputy interior minister of the
Mostar region. ``But after the elections, we plan to increase our
activities further.''
	   Dziho gave few other details because the month-long operation is
ongoing. But the crackdown, code-named ``Elections 98,'' has
already resulted in several arrests, confiscation of weapons,
drugs, vehicles and destruction of two marijuana plantations.
	   Southern Bosnia is considered a key route for drug trafficking,
weapons smuggling and transporting vehicles stolen from across
Europe.
	   In the past, many international and local officials considered
Mostar the center of the illegal network. Many criminals grew more
powerful during the 1992-1995 Bosnian war by controlling black
markets.
	   But in Mostar and elsewhere, such groups have prevented
implementation of the 1995 Dayton peace accord by blocking the
return of refugees from rival ethnic groups and seeking to prevent
law and order to preserve their power.
	   Arrests of several key figures over the past year have calmed
the situation somewhat, officials say, and recent coordinated
actions by police and customs authorities have broken several
smuggling networks.
	   ``This is a good progress,'' said Martin Garrod, a deputy to
Bosnia's top international mediator, Carlos Westendorp. Garrod is
in charge of peace implementation in southern Bosnia.
	   ``In fact if you wake up at night it's more likely to be dogs
barking than anything else,'' he said, referring to nighttime
explosions which used to be a feature of Mostar life.
	   The operation has forced some of the country's leading crime
bosses to reassess their activities. Garrod said that from Aug.
21-21, Bosnian Serb, Croat and Muslim mafia bosses held a
clandestine conference in Mostar to discuss ways to combat police
and set up new smuggling routes.
	   Garrod said the next step for police and their international
advisers will be to investigate ties between criminals and
politicians. For this to succeed, Garrod and other international
officials are hoping voters will select politicians during the
Saturday and Sunday national election to build an independent,
honest judiciary.
	   International officials cite several cases where suspects were
released by the courts despite strong evidence against them.
	   Dziho and Garrod said local police and international officials
are currently investigating a private company they suspect is a
cover for many illegal activities including drugs and stolen
vehicles.
	   Tax authorities and U.N. officials who tried to check the
company in the past have been beaten up, harassed and forced away.
	   Last month, Spanish peacekeepers and Canadian experts tried to
check reported environmental damage in the area but were ordered
out by the company's security guards.
	   Last week, police arrested five men from Stolac, believed to
work for the company and suspected of blowing up houses of Muslim
refugees.
	   The owner was also arrested but was charged with petty offenses
and released under a small bond.
	   ``If the police can work together although we were shooting at
each other during the war, the judges should also be able to work
together after these elections,'' Dziho said.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ When Marion Jones arrived this
week on her first visit to Africa, the African-American track star
felt overwhelmed by the chance to compete in a major event on the
continent.
	   ``Just getting my first view of Africa from the plane, I felt
butterflies,'' said Jones, who hopes to stay undefeated this year
in the women's sprints and long jump at the World Cup starting
Friday.
	   ``I just want to listen to the people and watch them. This
experience is very important to me.''
	   Competing in the first premier event in Africa sponsored by the
International Amateur Athletic Federation has special meaning for
many of the athletes in the star-studded field, from Africans
getting the rare chance to be hometown favorites to competitors
like Jones who identify with African heritage.
	   The World Cup brings together athletes from the United States,
Africa, Europe, the Americas, Oceania, Asia, and two European
national squads to compete for team honors in the three-day,
finals-only event.
	   For middle-distance ace Maria Mutola of Mozambique, competing in
South Africa means her mother will get to see her run for the first
time. Two busloads of friends from neighboring Mozambique also will
come to Johannesburg to cheer on the 25-year-old Mutola, 1993 world
champion in the women's 800-meter run and Olympic bronze medalist
at the Atlanta Games.
	   ``Competing here will be like a dream for me,'' she said. ``It
is very important for us as African athletes to get this chance to
promote the sport at home.''
	   IAAF President Primo Nebiolo sees the World Cup as a way to
promote track and field on a continent long plagued by hardship and
oppression.
	   ``This is a sign of how much we appreciate South Africa and how
much we want to help South Africa, and with South Africa, Africa,''
he told a news conference Thursday.
	   In a special tribute to Africans, the trophies for the World Cup
champion men's and women's teams have been named after Nelson
Mandela, the onetime political prisoner who became South Africa's
first black president in all-race elections in 1994 that ended
decades of racist rule under the apartheid regime.
	   On Thursday, several World Cup athletes -- including Jones,
men's high jump world record-holder Javier Sotomayer of Cuba and
Kenyan distance ace Daniel Komen -- went to Soweto to attend an
athletics fun day sponsored by the IAAF to promote sports among
children.
	   Nebiolo said the township, long a symbol of racist repression in
South Africa, now can spread a message of hope.
	   ``Soweto is a special place, which touches our conscience as men
and women, rather than sports administrators,'' he said.
	   But Africa's gain in getting to stage the World Cup in
Johannesburg has been Asia's loss. Nebiolo has come under fire
because the World Cup schedule conflicts with the Commonwealth
Games in Kuala Lumpur. Many stars have opted for the World Cup,
which is offering dlrs 3.5 million in individual prize money and
dlrs 100,000 for a world record.
	   Nebiolo rejected the criticism, saying the World Cup was
scheduled first and that Commonwealth organizers were advised to
pick another time for their event so it wouldn't be obscured by the
competition in South Africa.
	   ``There is a priority (for the IAAF) because track and field is
controlled by us, not by the Commonwealth Games,'' he said.
	   Nebiolo called the scheduling ``a grave mistake made by the
Commonwealth Games.''

<TEXT>
	   HEIMAEY, Iceland (AP) _ In a Hollywood-style finish, ``Free
Willy'' star Keiko returned home to the waters of Iceland on
Thursday after 19 years in captivity and a career as a movie star.
	   Transported by plane and boat to a protected cove off Iceland's
Vestmann Islands, the most famous killer whale in the world swam
into his home waters to the cheers of doting handlers and watched
by the world's press.
	   First indications were that it was a happy repatriation.
	   ``There's a great deal of joy and relief here,'' said Diana
Hammond of the Free Willy Keiko Foundation. ``It's a happy group.''
	   When the orca was first lowered into the water, he moved slowly,
his head nodding back and forth. But with the help of four divers,
who removed the sling in which he was lowered, Keiko dove below the
surface and began slowly swimming laps around the huge sea pen
where he is to adjust to the wild.
	   Like any weary traveler after an long flight, he seemed stiff at
first, but picked up the pace and swam strongly around his new
surroundings.
	   Keiko explored, diving and resurfacing while four divers who
have been his friends for years waited and watched anxiously.
	   As he swam past, one diver called out to another, ``He looks
real strong.''
	   Keiko's emergence in the sea pen marked his return to native
Icelandic waters he left at age 2. It was a big step toward
fulfilling his handlers' dreams of setting him free in the open
ocean, just as in the ``Free Willy'' movie that made him a star.
	   It was an emotional moment for members of the Free Willy Keiko
Foundation staffers who lined up along the barge to watch his
homecoming.
	   They cheered and whistled as the giant animal began thrashing
its tail.
	   Hundreds of excited children had welcomed Keiko to their small
town when he arrived in a huge U.S. Air Force cargo plane after an
eight-hour flight from Oregon.
	   ``For the children of the world, this is a wonderful event and
these airflifters showed that they can take anything anyplace
anytime,'' said Air Force Secretary F. Whitten Peters. He said the
Air Force was proud the mission went so smoothly.
	   The huge plane appeared to land normally in stiff headwinds at
Heimaey's airport, but broke part of a landing gear. It apparently
did not threaten the landing in any way.
	   A couple of hundred curious townsfolk dotted the landscape as
Keiko's holding tank was maneuvered from the plane to the waiting
flatbed truck with its ``Welcome Home Willy'' banner.
	   The truck with its famous passenger drove into the small town
past throngs of children waving little Icelandic and American flags
and welcoming him with ``Velkommen Keiko'' banners.
	   Some of the youngsters ran alongside the slowly moving truck
under crystal blue skies on a brisk late summer day.
	   Frans Friorikson, age 10, wearing his knitted hat with a stuffed
Keiko sewn to the top, went to the harbor to wave Keiko on.
	   ``It is real exciting,'' he said. ``Keiko is so good for
Iceland.''
	   The whale was loaded onto a barge and floated past spectacular
800-foot (250 meter) volcanic cliffs toward his sea pen in a
protected cove.
	   In the pen, the size of a football field, he will be
reintroduced to the sights and sounds of the waters where he was
captured as a 2-year-old. He will live in his pen until his
handlers determine he is able to live on his own.
	   Keiko began this step toward freedom on Wednesday when he swam
into a holding tank at the Oregon Coast Aquarium.
	   Bidding the whale goodbye was tough for the children who fell in
love with Keiko after watching his movies and seeing him in his
spacious pool over the past 2 1/2 years.
	   Hundreds of people, some with signs reading ``Keiko, we love
you'' and ``We will miss you,'' lined the highway as a truck
carried the whale to the airport.
	   Keiko's bid for freedom has its roots in Hollywood and the hopes
of children around the world.
	   In the 1993 box-office hit ``Free Willy,'' about an orca
threatened by a villainous amusement park owner, the whale played
by Keiko leaps over a breakwall to freedom in the open ocean.
	   Real life wasn't so tidy. It was learned that Keiko was
languishing in a cramped Mexico City tank.
	   School kids collected pennies to help save Keiko. Warner Bros.
and cell-phone billionaire Craig McCaw kicked in millions more to
bring the whale to the Oregon tank to recuperate from lung
infections and warty lesions, all with the aim of setting him free.
	   Trying to transform a long-captive whale back into a wild
predator has never been tried before, this effort has been
criticized by those who say Keiko isn't skilled enough at catching
fish, has no experience of other orcas and could be shocked by the
frigid, harsh conditions of the North Atlantic.
	   Even Keiko's most enthusiastic handlers say it will be at least
two years before they can determine if he can survive in the open
ocean.
	   He is 21 and his supporters hope he might have another 10 or
even 20 years of life.

Germany unveils plaque to women who stood up to Nazis to save Jews
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germany marked the courage of a group of German
women who protested Nazi efforts to deport their Jewish relatives
with a plaque and a call for Germans today not to be afraid to
stand up against injustice.
	   The women gathered in early 1943 outside a building on Rosen
Street, in central Berlin, where the Nazis were holding about 1,500
Jews _ mainly the husbands and children of the women.
	   After several days of protest, Nazi propaganda minister Joseph
Goebbels surprisingly ordered the Jews released.
	   Historians are still unsure why he caved into the protest, but
some speculate Nazi leaders were afraid the protest would escalate
following the German army's setbacks that winter at Stalingrad.
	   The plaque was unveiled Wednesday in Berlin by Rita Suessmuth,
president of the German parliament, and Ignatz Bubis, chairman of
the Central Council of Jews in Germany.
	   Suessmuth said the resistance shown by the ``women of Rosen
Street'' should inspire today's Berliners to work for tolerance.
	   Bubis called the willingness of the women to risk their lives to
save the 1,500 Jews ``a miracle,'' noting that such civil courage
is rare today.
	   ``Perhaps we've all become too self-involved,'' he said.
``Acceptance of each other is lacking.''

Thursday. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Prices on the Amsterdam Stock
Exchange skydived Thursday, closing down 5.1 percent after falling
all day and tumbling further as Wall Street foundered.
	   Traders blamed Wall Street's woes, the lower dollar and
continuing worries about the situation in Russia and Asia.
	   Investors also said the market was increasingly concerned about
the financial situation in Latin America and the political troubles
of U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   The 27-share AEX Index finished at 1021.31 points, down 55.28
points or 5.1 percent after dipping to as low as 1012.31 points. On
Wednesday, the AEX had closed down 1.7 percent at the final bell.
	   The continuing fall of the dollar also hurt the Amsterdam
bourse. At 1432 GMT, the U.S. currency was at 1.9121 guilders from
1.9395 guilders late Wednesday.
	   The Dutch stock market is highly dollar-sensitive because a
number of index companies derive much of their overseas revenues in
dollars.

Croatian war invalids protest TV broadcast of Bosnian Serb parties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ An association of Croats crippled in the
war against Croatia's rebel Serbs on Thursday demanded that state
TV stop broadcasting ``shameful'' Bosnian Serb political ads.
	   Television on Wednesday aired the ads as part of its coverage of
weekend elections in neighboring Bosnia. It had previously shown
ads of Muslim and Bosnian Croat parties running in those elections.
	   TV showed Serb symbols, and footage of Biljana Plavsic,
president of the Serb-controlled half of Bosnia.
	   Plavsic, now accepted by the West as a moderate Serb politician,
was previously a hardline Serb nationalist closely associated with
Radovan Karadzic, the former Bosnian Serb leader who is the
country's No. 1 war crimes suspect. She was also friendly with
Zeljko Raznatovic Arkan, whom Croats blame for atrocities committed
during the 1991 war here.
	   ``Croatian television's behavior was shameful, disgusting,
humiliating and anti-Croat,'' the association, called HVIDRA, said
in a statement.
	   The broadcasts of the Serb material began after the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which supervises the
Bosnian election removed some Bosnian Croat candidates from the
voting, citing bias on the part of Croatian television.

Ross says he finds Israel, Palestinians ready to make progress
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Ross quotes after meeting with Israeli president &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A U.S. peace envoy said Thursday that Israeli
and Palestinian leaders signaled readiness to move forward on a
deal for a West Bank troop withdrawal, but that several issues
still had to be tackled.
	   The envoy, Dennis Ross, held talks with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
on Wednesday evening. Ross said his mission would continue for at
least several more days.
	   ``I'm seeing whether or not it's possible to narrow the
differences,'' Ross told reporters after briefing Israeli President
Ezer Weizman. ``The initial sets of discussions, I think, have
indicated the desire to try to find ways.''
	   However, Weizman _ when asked whether he was more optimistic
after hearing from Ross _ answered with a curt: ``No.''
	   The envoy will now decide whether to start drafting at least
part of an agreement on a pullback, said a U.S. official who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
	   Ross is accompanied by Jonathan Schwartz, a U.S. State
Department legal adviser who drafted the 1997 agreement on an
Israeli withdrawal from most of the West Bank town of Hebron.
	   The Haaretz daily said Ross hopes to get something on paper by
the weekend, but that some issues would have to be finalized at the
highest levels, perhaps at a summit later this month when
Netanyahu, Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton attend the U.N.
General Assembly in New York.
	   On the table is a U.S. proposal for an Israeli withdrawal from
13 percent of the West Bank and detailed provisions for Palestinian
cooperation with Israel and the United States on security.
	   Israel initially rejected a 13 percent pullback, but then said
it would agree, provided that 3 percent of that area is declared a
nature reserve in which Israel retains security control and the
Palestinians are not be allowed to build.
	   The Palestinians have said they accepted temporary restrictions,
but wanted assurances that the area eventually come under full
Palestinian control.
	   Asked about the Palestinian demands, Netanyahu adviser David
Bar-Illan, said Thursday: ``We don't believe that would be an
obstacle. The main thing is that we would have security control and
the veto on construction which would prevent the building of
military installations.''
	   The most difficult issue facing Ross is Israel's demand to
renegotiate an agreement on security cooperation.
	   A blueprint for Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation and a
Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants was worked out by
Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. security officials last December, but
was rejected by Netanyahu as insufficient.
	   The Palestinians initially said they would not agree to changes,
but in recent days have softened their position.
	   The Yediot Ahronot daily said the Palestinians would consider
renegotiating the security understanding, provided that Israel
agreed to all elements of the U.S. peace initiative, including
proposals on how to determine the size of an additional withdrawal.
	   The Palestinians ``will not allow the fragmentation of the
American initiative,'' Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said
Wednesday evening, after Ross talked for three hours with Arafat.
	   Leaving the meeting with Arafat, Ross did not answer directly
when asked whether the Clinton administration was committed to all
points of the U.S. plan, first presented in January.
	   But Erekat said later the American envoy had pledged to deal
with issues ``in a comprehensive manner.''
	   Before the Ross-Arafat meeting, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright spoke with Arafat by telephone, stressing the importance
of settling remaining differences, U.S. State Department spokesman
James P. Rubin said in Washington.
	   In other developments Thursday:
	   _ A Palestinian woman hurt during clashes in a Jerusalem refugee
camp died of her wounds. The woman, 41-year-old Kamila Nather, was
walking in the street on Saturday when she was struck in the face
by a rubber-coated steel pellet fired by Israeli troops trying to
disperse Palestinian stone throwers.

French prime minister hopes for quick solution in Russia

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
said Thursday he would like to see a quick solution to the Russian
political crisis with the formation of a working government.
	   ``Naturally, as the prime minister of France it is not my place
to commment on what choice the Russian authorities have made,''
Jospin told a news conference.
	   ``But what I will say is that it would be desirable if Russia
could very soon form a government ... a government that could
confront the sizeable problems in Russia,'' Jospin said.
	   Jospin, who was in Helsinki on a one-day visit, earlier met with
President Martti Ahtisaari and talked about the Russian crisis with
Finnish Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen.
	   Jospin and Lipponen also unveiled a seven-page plan to cooperate
in telecommunications technology.
	   In a statement, France and Finland will cooperate to ``develop a
democratic information society in Europe,'' especially within the
European Union.
	   The statement warned that information technologies could divide
society, and that governments ``play an important role in ensuring
universal access to telecommunications services, particularly for
low-income and rural consumers.''
	   Commenting on the joint European currency, the euro, Jospin
described it as ``a factor of stability in Europe ... particularly
for those countries which have chosen to join it.''
	   Jospin declined to comment over the Lewinsky scandal taunting
President Clinton, but said he was concerned if the greatest world
power was hampered in making decisions that could affect the global
economy.

Top foreign adviser: India wants to be treated as world power
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DONNA BRYSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's top foreign policy adviser has
said his country's atomic ambitions were linked not just to its
fears of neighboring Pakistan and China, but to its desire to be
treated as a world power.
	   Jaswant Singh's 4,000-word essay in this month's issue of
Foreign Affairs magazine was perhaps the frankest admission of the
geopolitical _ rather than military _ reasons behind the series of
nuclear weapons tests India conducted deep under its western desert
in May.
	   ``Nuclear weapons remain a key indicator of state power,'' Singh
wrote. ``Since this currency is operational in large parts of the
globe, India was left with no choice but to update and validate the
capability that had been demonstrated 24 years ago in the nuclear
test of 1974.''
	   The Indian tests sparked answering tests from longtime rival
Pakistan, and the United States led the world in imposing
antinuclear economic sanctions on both South Asian countries. Singh
was appointed by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to discuss
nuclear policy with the United States; he has met several times
with U.S. envoy Strobe Talbott and more talks are planned.
	   Talbott has pressed India to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty unconditionally. Indian policy makers have long argued the
treaty freezes the technical advantage decades of testing has given
Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States. But many arms
control experts see it as a crucial first step toward ridding the
world of nuclear weapons.
	   When he announced his nuclear tests, Prime Minister Vajpayee
said he would consider signing some form of the treaty, known as
the CTBT. He declared a voluntary moratorium on further underground
tests and offered to formalize that unilateral ban.
	   ``Since India has already subscribed to the substance of the
test ban treaty, all that remains is its actual signature,'' Singh
wrote, without elaborating on whether India was ready to sign.
	   Since Singh wrote the article, India has repeated its opposition
to the treaty. In a statement this week, the foreign ministry said
the CTBT ``legitimizes the possession of nuclear arsenals of the
five ... nuclear weapon powers in perpetuity.''
	   In his essay, Singh also criticized the Nuclear Nonproliferation
Treaty, which bans the transfer of nuclear weapons technology to
most countries. At a conference in 1995, more than 170 nations
opted to extend the nonproliferation treaty indefinitely, rather
than continuing the twice-a-decade reviews it had been subject to
since coming into force in 1970.
	   Singh said that 1995 decision made the unequal and insecure
position of the nuclear ``have-nots'' permanent. Nuclear weapons
were therefore legitimized, he said.
	   ``India's nuclear policy remains firmly committed to a basic
tenet: that the country's national security in a world of nuclear
proliferation lies either in global disarmament or in the exercise
of the principle of equal and legitimate security for all,'' he
wrote.

Former South Vietnamese prime minister dead in Paris
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Vu Van Mau, a prominent figure in South Vietnam and
prime minister for five days before it fell to the Communist North
in 1975, has died in Paris, his son said Thursday. He was 84.
	   Dung Vu Hoang told The Associated Press in a telephone interview
that his father died in a Paris hospital on Aug. 20 of natural
causes.
	   Vu Van Mau served as foreign minister under President Ngo Dinh
Diem from 1955 to 1963. He was named prime minister five days
before the country fell to Communist troops on April 30, 1975.
	   He also was Vietnam's ambassador to Britain, Belgium, the
Netherlands and Austria in the mid 1960s, and was president of
South Vietnam's pacifist Forces for National Reconciliation party
before the country's collapse.
	   Known for his theories of non-violence, he authored books on
Buddhism, law and civilization. He remained in Vietnam until 1988,
when he settled in France.
	   Vu Van Mau is survived by five children and 15 grandchildren.
The funeral was held on Aug. 28.

Preparatory work begins for construction of Jewish History Museum

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Archeological excavations have started at
the site of the future Jewish history museum, paving the way for
the museum's construction, the initiators said Thursday.
	   Construction of the museum will take up to six years and is to
begin next year, after the archeological work is done and a project
selected, Grazyna Pawlak, a director of the Jewish History
Institute, told a news conference.
	   Initiated by the Jews and strongly supported by Poland's
political and religious leaders, the project ``opened the way for
an authentic dialogue,'' said Pawlak, whose Polish father saved her
Jewish mother from the Holocaust.
	   Poland's President Aleksander Kwasniewski and Prime Minister
Jerzy Buzek as well as the head of the Roman Catholic Church,
Cardinal Jozef Glemp support the idea of the museum.
	   So far organizers have collected about dlrs 1 million, of the
estimated dlrs 50 million needed for the museum, which is to
document a 1000-year history of Jewish life and culture in Poland,
said Warsaw Mayor Marcin Swiecicki, who heads the Polish committee
supporting the project.
	   In 1997, the city donated a plot of land for the museum.
	   The museum will stand on a green area which during World War II
was part of the overcrowded Warsaw Ghetto. The excavation work is
very meticulous in search of historic remains, including those of
the building that in 1942-43 housed the Judenrat, the Jewish
Council of the Ghetto.
	   The museum will tell the ``truth'' of Jewish history in Poland,
including its difficult aspects - manifestations of anti-Semitism,
the Nazi Holocaust carried out in Poland by German occupiers, and
the sacrifice of thousands of Poles who risked their lives to save
Jews, said Swiecicki.
	   Addressed primarily to young people from Poland and around the
world, it will use documents, pictures, artifacts, films but also
modern techniques like laser images.
	   Before World War II, Poland's 3.5 million Jews were the largest
single Jewish community in Europe, with some 380,000 living in
Warsaw alone. The Nazis crowded most of them into ghettos and then
sent them to death in the gas chambers of concentration camps.
	   Many survivors went to live in Israel, others were driven away
in 1968 by communist-sponsored anti-Semitic propaganda. Some 20,000
Jews live in Poland now.

Former ministers' trial set for Feb. 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Three former ministers will go to trial in February
for their roles in the AIDS-tainted blood scandal, climaxing a
six-year saga that shook France's public health system, judicial
sources said Thursday.
	   The trial will be held before a special Court of Justice of the
Republic that judges officials for crimes in office. It will be the
first time it sits to judge ministers.
	   The trial is to take place in the international conference
center in western Paris and is expected to last three weeks,
according to the sources, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   Former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius, former Health Minister
Edmond Herve and Georgina Dufoix, former Social Affairs Minister,
served from 1984-1986 in the Socialist government under President
Francois Mitterrand.
	   The ministers are charged with involuntary homicide in
connection with the deaths of seven people who received blood
contaminated with the HIV virus that causes AIDS. The seven are
among some 1,000 hemophiliacs infected by the virus through
transfusions. About half of them have died.
	   If convicted, the three face a maximum penalty of five years in
prison and $130,000 in fines.
	   A special investigative commission concluded in July that the
three contributed to the deaths, but the ministers maintain they
never knowingly approved the use of contaminated blood in
transfusions.
	   The prosecution contends, among other things, that the ministers
employed a ``strategy of favoritism'' in an unofficial policy to
keep a U.S.-made AIDS test off the French market while the Pasteur
Institute was perfecting its own test, eventually made available.
	   Judge Christian le Gunehec will preside over the trial. The jury
will be composed of three judges and 12 members of the French
Parliament.

Yeltsin taps foreign minister in bid to resolve Russian crisis

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin named a compromise candidate for
prime minister Thursday who should win swift approval in the
hostile parliament, ending a dangerous power struggle. But his
choice, Yevgeny Primakov, has neither economic experience nor a
blueprint for leading Russia out of its current morass.
	   The president's decision to put Primakov at the head of a new
government was well received by most opposition politicians and had
a calming effect on a country buffeted by political feuding and
economic collapse.
	   Primakov, the widely respected foreign minister and a former KGB
spy chief, could be confirmed in parliament as early as Friday. He
will need to quickly assemble a Cabinet to deal with the most
severe economic crisis since the Soviet collapse seven years ago.
	   ``I think he will get (parliament's) support. Common sense has
prevailed in our state,'' said Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov,
who spearheaded the opposition to the previous candidate for
premier, Viktor Chernomyrdin.
	   In Washington, White House press secretary Mike McCurry said
that the U.S. government ``knows and respects'' Primakov. ``We
would expect to have a good and close working relationship.''
	   In Russia's battered markets, the ruble strengthened for a
second day and stocks rose in response to Primakov's nomination.
But bringing Russia out of a wrenching economic slump that's a
decade old will be a massive undertaking. Primakov will face an
impatient nation that's battling high inflation, widespread
unemployment and industrial stagnation.
	   Yeltsin's compromise was seen by some opposition leaders as a
major defeat for the president. But Yeltsin, who retains full
control of the government, has compromised in the face of strong
opposition in the past. Primakov is a long-time ally of the
president who is not likely to challenge Yeltsin.
	   Primakov, 68, is highly regarded by most Russian political
groups. He has never expressed any political ambitions and is seen
as a technocrat, not ideologically linked to any faction.
	   A onetime KGB spymaster, the low-key, publicity shy Primakov
appears more comfortable handling discrete diplomatic negotiations
than enduring the glare of publicity that his new job will bring.
	   His public comments in recent years have focused almost
exclusively on foreign affairs, ignoring Russian domestic issues.
	   Primakov made no mention of his nomination when making a
previously scheduled speech to lawmakers from dozens of nations.
The conference, he said, was ``a sign of support given by the world
parliamentary community to Russia at a difficult time.''
	   As foreign minister, Primakov won praise at home for his efforts
to restore some of Russia's diminished international clout and
create a ``multipolar'' world designed to counterbalance U.S.
dominance.
	   Primakov is expected to support economic reforms, but he has not
made any public comments about what sort of economic program he
envisions. Based on his work as foreign minister, Primakov may seek
international help in rebuilding Russia's economy.
	   Yet he still considers Russia one of the world's leading powers
and feels it should not become subservient to the West or sacrifice
its independence for the sake of closer relations or economic aid.
	   He has cool, but cordial relations with the United States. There
has been periodic friction over his desire to ease sanctions
against Iraq, maintain nuclear cooperation with Iran, and resist
NATO's expansion.
	   Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev picked him as one of his
closest aides during the reform period of the late 1980s.
	   He entered the international spotlight at the end of 1990 when,
shortly before the Gulf War began, he made several high-profile
trips to Iraq and tried unsuccessfully to persuade Saddam Hussein
to withdraw from Kuwait.
	   Primakov was briefly first deputy director of the KGB, the main
Soviet security organization in 1991. After the Soviet breakup, he
served as head of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service until
Yeltsin named him foreign minister in 1996.
	   Yeltsin settled on Primakov after parliament twice rejected
Chernomyrdin, with opposition leaders vowing to vote him down again
on a third and final vote.
	   ``I cannot harm Russia. Russia has had enough upheavals this
century. This is my choice,'' Chernomyrdin said after dropping out
of the race.
	   Chernomyrdin spent five years as prime minister before Yeltsin
fired him last March, and many Russians blame him for the country's
economic problems.
	   If parliament was to reject Primakov _ an unlikely scenario _
then the president would be required to dissolve the Duma and call
new elections.
	   In a nationally televised address, Chernomyrdin said
parliament's refusal to confirm him was part of a Communist plot to
force Yeltsin to resign and seize power. ``It's a creeping coup.''
	   He reproached Yeltsin for making concessions, urging him: ``Show
will!'' _ warning that Russia is in danger of being engulfed by
fascism.

Finance minister says Indian industry must prepare for fierce
</HEADLINE>
competition &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Indian industries will perish if they
cannot compete with rivals around the world, the finance minister
said Thursday.
	   ``The 21st century will be an era of fierce competition. ... No
sector will be reserved for Indians,'' Sinha told business leaders
during a lecture on his vision for Indian industry.
	   The nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, to which Sinha belongs,
had been accused of waving the swadeshi (nationalist) banner before
it formed a coalition federal government.
	   Sinha said the term swadeshi had been misunderstood.
	   ``Our (India's) desire to escape competition has been our
hallmark. We've been afraid of competition. Swadeshi means
competition, going out into the world.''
	   India began opening up its economy in 1991, but foreign
companies are not allowed to invest in insurance or airlines and
permitted a minority share in areas like telecom.
	   The country must prepare for competition by building up
infrastructure, he said.
	   Sinha said world class infrastructure would give countries of
East Asia the edge once they overcame the ongoing economic crisis.
	   The Indian public sector's control over infrastructure has been
blamed for lack of results, and Sinha stressed the need to
disinvest.
	   ``We can go for disinvestment, go for privatization and create
new assets for the people of this country. Subsidies have created a
huge distortion in our economy,'' he said.

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Children don't go to school, commuters
stay off the roads and diplomats ride boats to their offices in the
flooded Bangladeshi capital, parts of which are already submerged
in waist-high water.
	   Amir Khasru, who runs an electronic equipment shop in one of the
few dry areas in downtown Dhaka, has seen his average daily
turnover slide from 100,000 takas (dlrs 2,127) to about 10,000
takas (dlrs 212).
	   ``Everyone is saving money for the worst days they fear after
the floods,'' Khasru said.
	   Most of Dhaka was in waist-high water during floods a decade
ago. This year at least one-third of the city has remained dry
because of an embankment built in 1989 to protect the city from the
Turag river that flows to the north and west.
	   To the south, an embankment along the Buriganga and Sitalakhya
rivers is believed in danger of collapsing. Farmlands and areas
near the riverbanks are in floodwaters up to waist high.
	   Across Bangladesh, flooding has continued for over eight weeks
this year, claiming more than 850 lives and affecting nearly 35
million people _ one-fourth of the country's population.
	   The floods have inundated highways in many parts of the country.
Road links to Dhaka have been cut, so supplies must be ferried in
from rest of the country.
	   Prices of rice and other scarce foods have risen by an average
five percent in part because of hoarding, said Atiur Rahman, an
economist at the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies.
	   Schools are closed because many students are marooned and the
buildings have been turned into shelters for thousands of displaced
people, officials said.
	   Most residents are still confined to their homes. Only a few
motorists drive through streets not swamped by water, while
residents in the flooded areas depend mainly on boats.
	   Among the hardest-hit districts are Dhaka's plush Gulshan and
Baridhara areas, where most of the foreign diplomats work and live.
Many diplomats ride boats to their offices.

Troussier picked new Japanese soccer coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Philippe Troussier of France was tapped Thursday to
lead Japan's soccer team, which has been missing a head coach after
losing all three games at this year's World Cup.
	   Troussier, 43, who coached South Africa's World Cup team, signed
a two-year contract that would include coaching the 2000 Sydney
Olympics, Kyodo News reported.
	   Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Japanese soccer officials
were not immediately available for comment late Thursday.
	   ``He has plenty of international experience and a solid
theoretical approach to the game,'' Japan Football Association
official Kuniya Daini was quoted as saying by Kyodo.
	   Troussier replaces Takeshi Okada, who resigned after Japan was
eliminated in the first round at the World Cup in France. South
Africa was also eliminated in the first round but managed two
draws.
	   A disappointed South African Football Association terminated
Troussier's contract after the World Cup.
	   Troussier makes his debut as Japanese coach in a friendly
against Egypt in Osaka, 400 kilometers (250 miles) west of Tokyo,
on Oct. 28, Kyodo said.
	   Arsene Wenger, former head coach of the Nagoya Grampus Eight in
the professional soccer league here, has long been a favorite among
Japanese fans as a coach candidate.
	   But Wenger, a Frenchman, is signed as head coach of the English
Premier League team Arsenal.

Adams, Trimble break the ice after three frosty years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; NEW throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Setting aside profound
suspicions, Protestant leader David Trimble talked in depth for the
first time Thursday with Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams about the proposed
Northern Ireland government.
	   ``We are now dealing with the crisis in the way it should be
dealt with _ by direct dialogue,'' Adams said after meeting for 45
minutes alone with Trimble, who was elected ``first minister'' of
the embryonic government in July.
	   Trimble had refused to talk directly with Adams' IRA-allied
party since his 1995 election as leader of the Ulster Unionists,
the major representative of Northern Ireland's British Protestant
majority.
	   He and Adams sat at the same negotiating table for eight months
with Trimble insistent upon talking about Sinn Fein only through
the peace talks' chairman, former U.S. George Mitchell.
	   But Trimble talked briefly with Adams on Monday during a
conference of all political leaders who support April's multi-party
accord on how Protestants and Catholics should jointly govern
Northern Ireland.
	   And both leaders came away from their more personal encounter
Thursday in Stormont Parliamentary Building sounding hopeful that
their fundamental differences could be narrowed.
	   Adams expects his party to hold two positions in a possible
12-member administration, which is being drawn from a much larger
legislative Assembly elected in June.
	   So far, the Assembly has approved only Trimble in the top post
and moderate Catholic politician Seamus Mallon as his deputy. The
108-member Assembly is scheduled to reconvene next week to debate
which parties should hold what posts, and how many should be
created.
	   The accord specifies that the Irish Republican Army should
disarm under international supervision by mid-2000.
	   Trimble insisted Thursday that most Protestant members of the
Assembly would veto Sinn Fein's right to hold top posts if the IRA
refused to start disarming.
	   Considering their long track record of verbally sparring through
the media, however, Thursday's post-meeting comments by Trimble and
Adams appeared surprisingly conciliatory.
	   ``He's a man who I can do business with. He's a man I have do
business with,'' Adams said.
	   ``I put it to Mr. Trimble that he and I had been cast in these
positions and we had to narrow the gap. We had to find ways for him
to help me and me to help him,'' he said.
	   Trimble said he wasn't seeking to publicly shame the IRA-Sinn
Fein movement by demanding disarmament, but that eliminating
``private armies'' was an ``inevitable consequence'' of April's
agreement.
	   ``We are not saying to people that you have to surrender arms or
in any way feel humiliated,'' Trimble said, adding that he was
``quite satisfied'' that Adams understood the difference between
that and internationally supervised disarmament.
	   In an important concrete pledge, Trimble said he expected
Northern Ireland's new administration to meet formally with the
Irish government by early October.
	   Formal policy coordination between Northern Ireland and the
Irish Republic was an essential part of the agreement for
Catholics, moderates and militants alike, who seek Ireland's
eventual unification.
	   Also Thursday, Northern Ireland's police commander announced
that his forces would no longer require backup from British
soldiers in Belfast, although the army would remain active in the
most hard-line Catholic parts of rural Northern Ireland.
	   Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan's announcement didn't affect
troop strengths in Northern Ireland, which will remain at about
17,000. But soldiers in Belfast would be expected largely to remain
inside barracks, a step towards what Sinn Fein calls its goal of
``demilitarization.''

Cabinet approves 1999 budget with small changes from 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) - The Council of Ministers approved
Thursday the 1999 budget, envisaging an expenditure of 1,687
million Cyprus pounds (dlrs 3,374 million) and an income of 1,106
million (dlrs 2,212 million).
	   Income and expenditure provisions are only slightly higher than
the 1998 figures _ 3.3 percent for expenditure and 2.45 percent for
income. But the budget deficit will increase by 6.7 percent, from
554 million pounds (dlrs 1,108 million) this year to 580 million
(dlrs 1,160 million) next year.
	   Finance Minister Christodoulos Christodoulou said the increase
in the deficit was primarily due to the loss of just under 300
million pounds ( dlrs 600 million) in customs revenue in the last
two years because of the implementation of the customs union
agreement with the European Union.
	   He estimates that the public debt will rise to 61.7 percent of
GNP, exceeding the Maastricht criteria for the first time.
	   He added that the rate of economic development is expected to
rise to 4 percent in real terms despite the financial crises in
Asia and Russia. This will permit unemployment to be maintained at
about 3 percent while inflation will also remain low, between 2.5
percent and 3 percent.
	   Christodoulou said it will be necessary to increase taxation to
maintain these figures. This may be done through a gradual increase
in the Value Added Tax, which is currently only 8 percent compared
to the EU figure of 15 percent.
	   Christodoulou will present the budget to parliament for approval
before the end of the month.
	   In June, Parliament rejected an increased tax package submitted
by Christodoulou _ primarily because President Glafcos Clerides,
who was re-elected narrowly to a second five year term in February,
had promised there would be no tax hikes during the year.

	   MOSTAR, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ To ensure a peaceful election
this weekend, police are cracking down on Bosnian Serb, Croat and
Muslim crime bosses in hopes of reducing their grip on political
and economic power in southern Bosnia.
	   ``We have increased police activities in the light of the coming
elections,'' said Sefkija Dziho, deputy interior minister of the
Mostar region. ``But after the elections, we plan to increase our
activities further.''
	   Dziho gave few other details because the month-long operation is
ongoing. But the crackdown, code-named ``Elections 98,'' has
already resulted in several arrests, confiscation of weapons,
drugs, vehicles and destruction of two marijuana plantations.
	   Southern Bosnia is considered a key route for drug trafficking,
weapons smuggling and transporting vehicles stolen from across
Europe.
	   In the past, many international and local officials considered
Mostar the center of the illegal network. Many criminals grew more
powerful during the 1992-1995 Bosnian war by controlling black
markets.
	   But in Mostar and elsewhere, such groups have prevented
implementation of the 1995 Dayton peace accord by blocking the
return of refugees from rival ethnic groups and seeking to prevent
law and order to preserve their power.
	   Arrests of several key figures over the past year have calmed
the situation somewhat, officials say, and recent coordinated
actions by police and customs authorities have broken several
smuggling networks.
	   ``This is a good progress,'' said Martin Garrod, a deputy to
Bosnia's top international mediator, Carlos Westendorp. Garrod is
in charge of peace implementation in southern Bosnia.
	   ``In fact if you wake up at night it's more likely to be dogs
barking than anything else,'' he said, referring to nighttime
explosions which used to be a feature of Mostar life.
	   The operation has forced some of the country's leading crime
bosses to reassess their activities. Dziho said that from Aug.
18-21, Bosnian Serb, Croat and Muslim mafia bosses held a
clandestine conference in Mostar to discuss ways to combat police
and set up new smuggling routes.
	   Dziho said the next step for police and their international
advisers will be to investigate ties between criminals and
politicians. For this to succeed, Dziho and international officials
are hoping voters will select politicians during the Saturday and
Sunday national election to build an independent, honest judiciary.
	   Officials cite several cases where suspects were released by the
courts despite strong evidence against them.
	   Dziho and Garrod said local police and international officials
are currently investigating a private company they suspect is a
cover for many illegal activities including drugs and stolen
vehicles.
	   Tax authorities and U.N. officials who tried to check the
company in the past have been beaten up, harassed and forced away.
	   Last month, Spanish peacekeepers and Canadian experts tried to
check reported environmental damage in the area but were ordered
out by the company's security guards.
	   Last week, police arrested five men from Stolac, believed to
work for the company and suspected of blowing up houses of Muslim
refugees.
	   The owner was also arrested but was charged with petty offenses
and released under a small bond.
	   ``If the police can work together although we were shooting at
each other during the war, the judges should also be able to work
together after these elections,'' Dziho said.

Islamic Bank package seen unlikely to ease near-term cash crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMIR ZIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ In desperate bid to raise cash
reserves, Pakistan has agreed to a dlrs 1.5 billion crisis package
from the Islamic Development bank at such crippling interest rates
that analysts Thursday predicted will do little to ease the
country's economic crisis.
	   Pakistan, scrambling to raise money from global donor agencies,
Wednesday signed an agreement with a consortium of Islamic and
Middle Eastern banks to create a ``Pakistan Fund'' to help the
troubled South Asia nation cover its balance of payments deficit
and foreign debt obligations.
	   The nation of 130 million people, already struggling with a dlrs
32 billion foreign debt and an acute shortage of foreign currency,
has been pushed to the brink of economic collapse by international
sanctions. World lenders cut off the nation of 130 million people
after it conducted a series of nuclear tests in May.
	   On Friday, Pakistan is opening talks with a joint International
Monetary Fund-World Bank team on a broader economic relieve
package, which could include stalling foreign debt payments until
loans can be restructured. Pakistan signing a treaty banning
nuclear weapons testing is seen a key conditions of new loans.
	   The IDB has pledged dlrs 200 million to the ``Pakistan Fund,'' a
statement by Pakistan finance ministry said.
	   Saqib Sherani, an analyst at ABN AMRO Bank, said Islamic and
Middle Eastern banks would probably wait for the outcome of
Pakistan's talks with the IMF before committing any more money.
	   ``They will wait for the fog to clear in the next two weeks
until Pakistan hold talks with the IMF and the World Bank.... If
Pakistan went for a moratorium (on the repayment of current debt),
commercial banks will face difficulty to finance the country,'' he
said.
	   Pakistan will pay more than 10 percent interest for the
``Pakistan Fund''loans, adding to its already unmanageable debt
burden.
	   Salman Ali, chief analyst of the Indosuez W.I. Carr brokerage,
said the package which carry an annual interest of 5.0 percent over
London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), which is now 5.5 percent for
U.S. dollars.
	   Abid Naqvi, chief analyst of Taurus Securities, said the IDB
package has not provided the immediate cash Pakistan needs to avoid
default on its foreign debt payments this month. Pakistan is due to

million in foreign currency reserves.

external debt as any fresh inflows will take time to come,'' he
said.

Host Malaysia trounces Kenya 4-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Shankar Ramu scored two penalty
corner goals Thursday to help host Malaysia score a convincing 4-0
victory over Kenya in a preliminary men's field hockey match of the
Commonwealth Games.
	   The dominance of the hosts was evident from the beginning when
Ramu scored in the fourth minute. He started the corner and took a
return pass from Nor Saiful Zaini Nasiruddin to slam the ball in.
Ramu scored again in the 57th minute.
	   But coach Paul Lissek of Germany blasted Malaysia's inaugural
performance at the games, saying his players made ``simple mistakes
like children. Unbelievable!''
	   Lissek said the Malaysian passing was not too good and they
flubbed chances that were crafted after good moves.
	   ``But that's natural with an inexperienced team. We have very
young players,'' said Lissek who took over in July following
Malaysia's dismal performance during the World Cup in May. It
finished 11 among 12 nations.
	   This was Kenya's second straight loss at the Games. Pakistan
defeated it 5-4 on Wednesday.
	   Malaysia's second goal was scored in the 23rd minute by Charil
Anuar Abdul Aziz, also from a penalty corner.
	   On top of the defeat, Kenya suffered a setback when Kenneth
Kaunda Midundo was struck on the face by a streaking ball shot by
Nor Azlan Bakar during a penalty corner in the 60th minute.
Midundo's face was bloodied and he was taken away on stretcher. His
condition was not immediately known.
	   However, the foul of stopping the ball with the body in the
circle resulted in a penalty stroke, which Kuhan Shanmuganathan
converted easily.
	   In other matches, New Zealand and South Africa drew 3-3 with all
the South African goals scored by Greg Nicol. Two New Zealand goals
were scored by Ryan Archibald and one by Kenneth Robinson.
Meanwhile, Wales defeated Trinidad and Tobago 2-0.
	   Following are the statistics for the countries in two pools. The
numbers correspond to matches played, won, drawn, lost and points.

Indian prime minister to discuss flooding with Nepal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
surveyed the area hardest hit by torrential rains in northern
India, and pledged Thursday to find a regional solution to the
flooding problem that has killed more than 2,000 people over the
past two months.
	   Northern and eastern India, most of neighboring Bangladesh and
parts of neighboring Nepal have been devastated by an unusually
heavy monsoon this year. Experts say the impact of the flooding has
been worsened by deforestation, the location of villages in
low-lying areas or too close to embankments built to control
flooding, and in some cases the embankments themselves.
	   Vajpayee, in a speech in Gorakhpur, 250 kilometers (150 miles)
north of the Uttar Pradesh state capital of Lucknow, said he would
discuss the issue with his Nepalese counterpart.
	   ``Together both the countries will work out a detailed scheme to
control floods and minimize devastation caused by rivers,''
Vajpayee said.
	   Indian officials put the flood death toll at 1,692 over the past
two months, and lanslides and flooding have killed 65 people in
Nepal. Across Bangladesh, flooding has continued for over eight
weeks this year, claiming more than 850 lives and affecting nearly
35 million people _ one-fourth of the country's population.
	   Flooding is routine along several major rivers that sweep down
from Nepal through India and Bangladesh into the Bay of Bengal.
This year's flooding was much worse than normal.
	   Vajpayee also visited camps for people displaced by flooding,
and announced the federal government would spend 3 million rupees
(about dlrs 71,000) on flood relief and rehabilitation for the
Gorakhpur region. Much of the Gorakhpur region remained under water
Thursday, but rains have tapered off and the flooding began to
recede this week.

Resistant bateria becoming a global health threat, conference says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ European health officials on Thursday
said bacteria resistant to antibiotics have become a major global
problem and will lead to increased death, illness and health care
costs.
	   ``In the long term the frightening prospect is that there will
be no efficient antibiotics against a great number of potentially
lethal disease,'' said Danish Health Minister Carsten Koch at a
two-day conference of health officials from 28 European countries.
	   The conference comes just days after Danish officials reported a
62-year-old woman died from an antibiotics-resistant strain of
salmonella, called DT104. It was the first fatality in Denmark
known to have been caused by DT104, which has been rampant in
Britain for a decade and is known to have caused at least one death
in the United States.
	   ``Bacteria are found everywhere and know no boundaries,'' Koch
said, adding ``international cooperation is needed to tackle the
problem.
	   The conference recommended that doctors, veterinarians, farmers
and consumers reconsider their use of antibiotics which should only
be sold by prescription.
	   ``We must change people's attitude to antibiotics. A pill is not
appropriated for all illness or infections,'' said Jeremy Metters
of the British Department of Health, at the end of the conference
in a northern Copenhagen suburb.
	   Participants said using anti-microbials as growth promoter in
farming ``was not justified'' and called upon replacing with safe
alternatives, including better farming practice.
	   Treatment of multi-resistant bacteria increases health costs in
average 25 times, said Hans Joern Komos of a Copenhagen university
hospital's microbiological department.
	   The conference also was attended by the World Health
Organization, the European Union, consumer organizations,
university experts and representative of the animal food industry.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.S. official saying the two sides have not yet
reached stage of starting to write a draft &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli and Palestinian leaders have shown
readiness to move forward on a deal for a West Bank troop
withdrawal, but several issues still have to be tackled, a U.S.
mediator said Thursday.
	   The envoy, Dennis Ross, held talks with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
on Wednesday evening. Ross said his mission would continue for at
least several more days.
	   ``I'm seeing whether or not it's possible to narrow the
differences,'' Ross told reporters after briefing Israeli President
Ezer Weizman. ``The initial sets of discussions, I think, have
indicated the desire to try to find ways.''
	   However, Weizman _ when asked whether he was more optimistic
after hearing from Ross _ answered with a curt: ``No.''
	   Ross is accompanied by Jonathan Schwartz, a U.S. State
Department legal adviser who drafted the 1997 agreement on an
Israeli withdrawal from most of the West Bank town of Hebron.
	   The Haaretz daily said Thursday that Ross hoped to get something
on paper by the weekend.
	   However, a U.S. official said there was no indication that the
two sides had reached the stage of writing a draft. ``We are still
working on issues, rather than writing things,'' said the official
who spoke on condition of anonymity.

<TEXT>
	   ISTINIC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ An estimated 25,000 civilians crowded
Thursday into this small village in southwestern Kosovo, terrified
they would be caught in a pincer strike by Serb troops and tanks
that blasted their villages.
	   Village elders said at least five people -- including two
infants -- had died Wednesday of sickness or wounds suffered while
fleeing the Serb onslaught.
	   A 16-year-old boy lay on the floor of a house, hiding for fear
he would be caught by Serb police patrols. A plastic bag collected
his excrements as a gaping wound -- which he said he received when
a policeman shot him -- exposed his intestines.
	   Down the road, a woman ran screaming, carrying an infant whose
head was kicked by a horse when she and her family fled an attack.
As blood streamed from the infant's head, the woman desperately
sought medical help which was nowhere to be found.
	   The refugees were the latest victims of the crackdown on ethnic
Albanians in the Serbian province. They fled on tractors and wagons
heaped with their belongings, clogging a dirt road Wednesday in a
column 11 kilometers (seven miles) long, according to Western
observers who visited the area.
	   In a news release Wednesday, the Geneva-based United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees warned it ``fears slaughter may
occur if a shell hits the column of people.''
	   Kosovo is in southern Serbia, the dominant of two republics left
in the Yugoslav Federation. Its population is 90 percent ethnic
Albanian, most of whom back the rebels' armed struggle for
independence after decades of repression by Serbian authorities.
	   One official said the current refugee situation threatens to
create as many as 25 new ghost towns in Kosovo, where dozens of
villages already have been charred and emptied in the face of
shelling or clashes between Serb security forces and ethnic
Albanian rebels.
	   Fernando del Mundo, a UNHCR spokesman, estimated the number of
refugees here at up to 25,000. They were clustered Thursday in
groups of several thousand here, several thousand there, strung out
along roads and crowded into homes in this village.
	   Rrok Berisha, a member of Kosovo's unathorized parliament, said
he had been trapped here for three days. He feared the number of
refugees in the area could reach 100,000 as police cleared more
villages.
	   The chaotic exodus began Tuesday from villages in an area about
30 kilometers (18 miles) south of Pec, Kosovo's second-largest
city.
	   ``They're panicking and going everywhere, but they don't know
which way to go,'' said del Mundo, who heard shelling and saw
billows of smoke in the area Wednesday. ``The shelling is closing
in like a pincer.''
	   Tens of thousands of others remain dangerously close to the
shelling and may also soon flee, he said, swelling the number of
Kosovo refugees from its current estimate of 265,000.
	   Western officials fear the worst if urgent help isn't provided
for the 50,000 or so refugees now living in the hills and forests
and facing starvation or freezing.
	   ``If something isn't done soon, we can expect a humanitarian
drama within weeks,'' Belgian Foreign Minister Erik Derycke said in
Pristina after meeting with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   The United Nations estimated this week that 600 to 700 civilians
have been killed in six months of fighting between Serb-led forces
and Kosovo Albanian rebels.
	   While world leaders have condemned the Serbs for killing
civilians and for their scorched-earth tactics targeting ethnic
Albanian villages, the Serbs also accuse the militants of
massacring Serb civilians.
	   Western officials have held out the threat of military
intervention for months if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
doesn't halt the offensive. But such plans have been stymied by the
failure to reach an international consensus and by the difficulties
of mounting an effective military action in the mountainous region.
	   NATO's southern European commander, Adm. T. Joseph Lopez, said
Wednesday that the alliance would need about 50,000 troops to
monitor a possible peace agreement or cease-fire in Kosovo.
	   President Clinton released dlrs 20 million in aid for Kosovo
refugees Wednesday. The White House said the money, added to an
earlier U.S. contribution of dlrs 11 million, will go to U.N. and
private agencies providing food and shelter for refugees.
	   But a U.S. State Department official said no amount of aid will
help unless the Serbian government allows secure access to the
area.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army, meanwhile, criticized the United
States and Rugova for supporting a peace proposal that the group
says does nothing for its cause: independence.
	   Last week, U.S. envoy Christopher Hill won agreement in
principle by both Milosevic and Rugova on an interim settlement
that would grant Kosovo self-rule rather than independence.
	   In a statement published today by the daily Koha Ditore, the
guerrilla group said the deal is ``aimed at demobilizing the masses
who have joined the liberation war ... (and) destruction of the
KLA.''

Yugoslavia suspends deportation agreement with Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Angered by a European Union flight
ban, Yugoslavia on Thursday suspended an agreement which calls for
the deportation of tens of thousands of its citizens from Germany.
	   Germany and 14 other EU countries on Sunday banned the Yugoslav
national carrier, JAT, from landing on their airports in response
to the crackdown by Serb-led forces on ethnic Albanians fighting
for independence in Serbia's southern Kosovo province.
	   In May 1996, Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic and German
foreign minister Klaus Kinkel agreed on the deportation back home
of some 130,000 of mostly Kosovo Albanians who have been denied
asylum in Germany.
	   The Yugoslav government said in a statement that it was
suspending the agreement ``because it calls for Yugoslav carriers
to be used'' in the deportations.
	   About 12,000 ethnic Albanians have been deported to Kosovo since
the agreement was signed.
	   The government also blasted the EU flight ban, calling it
``unlawful, arbitrary and discriminatory.'' It announced
unspecified legal action against EU countries which imposed the
flight embargo in order to compensate JAT's losses.
	   However, the government said there will be no reciprocal ban of
foreign carriers flying to Belgrade.
	   It said that the EU embargo ``will not help in solving the
Kosovo problem, but to the contrary will encourage (Albanian)
separatists and terrorists who are operating in Kosovo.''

Young Dutchman Van der Kemp to be new designer at Guy Laroche
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SUZY PATTERSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Fashion Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - With enthusiastic backing and a solid background in
designing in the United States, Dutchman Ronald Van der Kemp will
take over creation of Guy Laroche's ready-to-wear.
	   His first collection will come out next March for the 1999 fall
ready-to-wear.
	   As ``French'' fashion continues on the international fast track,
this brings another man from northern Europe into the big fashion
picture, along with familiar names like Anne Demeulemeester, Dries
van Noten and others from Holland, Belgium and Germany.
	   ``There were many applicants, but Ronald looked like the perfect
one. We find his qualifications excellent for continuing to develop
our house image, our brand identity,'' Ralph Toledano, president of
Guy Laroche, said Thursday.
	   The successful house of Laroche, whose founder died in 1989, was
left without a creator since the most recent designer, American
Alber Elbaz, was lured away last summer to design ready-to-wear for
Yves Saint Laurent.
	   Van der Kemp, 33, a graduate of the Academy of Art and Design in
Amsterdam, had a short training stint at Courreges in Paris, then
spent three years designing for Bill Blass ready-to-wear, and the
past four years creating the women's wear collection at Barneys,
New York.
	   Once an enthusiastic dancer who had to stop because of back
problems, Van der Kemp is the artist of his middle-class,
business-oriented family; father in the meat wholesaling business,
his brother teaches German.
	   ``He saw the qualifications for the Laroche job in Women's Wear
Daily, and said `that's me,''' Toledano said. ``Everything fit,
from his sense of exuberant color to the wearability of Laroche
clothes.''
	   Toledano praises Van der Kemp for his unique blending of
sensuality, romanticism and original juggling of creativity with
what will sell off the racks.
	   Long known for high-quality designer-label clothes at quite
reasonable prices, Laroche aims to re-capture this selling-point
momentum.
	   ``It's the way things are going today, intriguing fashion for
reasonable prices,'' said house spokesman Georges Bully.
	   He emphasized that the American market is a big consideration.
	   ``Ronald told me that he loved the American woman's way of using
big, expansive gestures, versus the smaller, constricted way French
women move,'' Bully said. ``He aims to make his inspiration a
combination of the two.''

Polish feminists protest minister's idea to subsidize Viagra
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A government minister's proposal to
subsidize Viagra prescriptions to boost Poland's fertility drew
outrage Thursday from feminists, who said the government cares more
about men's pleasure than women's health.
	   The Federation for Women and Family Planning said the idea was
especially outrageous given that the Solidarity-led government cut
subsidies for contraception earlier this year in its effort to
reverse a decline in Polish births.
	   ``Access to contraception is generally considered a major
condition to improve women's health. Meanwhile, it is hard to
evaluate the impact of Viagra on men's health,'' the group said in
a statement.
	   ``The current government cares more about pleasure of men than
health care for women,'' the group said.
	   Polish medical authorities approved Viagra impotence pill for
the Polish market on Wednesday.
	   The government minister for family issues, Kazimierz Kapera,
said later that day that he would propose subsidizing Viagra ``to
boost births in our homeland.''
	   The Health Ministry will consider the idea next spring in its
annual review of the government's medicine subsidies.
	   The Solidarity-led government is trying to encourage families to
have more children.
	   A government report on Polish families released in July showed a
20 percent decrease in marriage rates and a 30 percent decrease in
birth rates since Poland's 1989 transition to a market economy.

Ruble and stocks buoyed by Primakov nomination for prime minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Politics &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's crippled currency and stock markets
showed new life Thursday, continuing their recovery while the
country's political crisis neared resolution.
	   Both were heartened by President Boris Yeltsin's decision to
nominate a compromise candidate for prime minister _ Yevgeny
Primakov, the current foreign minister who is expected to win swift
approval in parliament.
	   The stock market rose on the news, closing up nearly 5 percent
at 64.60 points. Perhaps more important, trading volume _ which has
been negligible in recent days _ improved to dlrs 3.1 million from
dlrs 0.6 million Wednesday.
	   The ruble, too, gained some ground after falling as low as 20
rubles a dollar earlier this week from the pre-crisis level of
about 6. On Thursday, it rose to 12-13 rubles to the dollar on the
Moscow interbank exchange, up from 13-15 rubles late Wednesday.
	   Meanwhile, the government took steps to restock the consumer
market, depleted by a wave of panic buying.
	   ``We now have the situation similar to what existed at the start
of free-market reforms when the stores were empty and people had
their fridges filled to capacity,'' Ivan Starikov, a deputy
economics minister, said at a news conference on Thursday.
	   He and other government officials while the country has plenty
of food, it could take as long as three months to fix disruptions
in the distribution system and suggested a series of measures to
speed the process.
	   Traders said market participants welcomed the end to political
stalemate but remained cautious about what economic course Primakov
will take.
	   Primakov has made nearly no comments on domestic policy and it
is not clear what kind of policy he would pursue. Some hard-liners
have been pressing the government to print new rubles in order to
pay months of back wages and pensions even though that would fuel
inflation.
	   The ruble's sharp fall triggered price hikes and a wave of panic
buying as people tried to hoard staples. Cheap groceries and other
basic goods have quickly disappeared from the shelves, or
resurfaced at prices often overshooting the ruble's plunge.
	   Before the crisis, more than half the food sold in Russian
stores was imported. The devaluation of the ruble has made imports
more expensive and the banking crisis has slowed or frozen payments
to importers. As a result, Russia's imports have dropped by 40-45
percent since Aug. 17, State Customs Committee chief Valery
Draganov said at a news conference.
	   He proposed lowering some tariffs, letting importers postpone
payments to the state and offering them other privileges.
	   The government is also considering legalizing cash transactions
on the wholesale market, said Ivan Gorbachev, a deputy trade and
industry minister. In recent years, wholesale transactions were
legal only when conducted by bank transfer.

Fire blackens the skies of Istanbul
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Thick gray smoke filled the skies over
the Bosporus strait Thursday as firefighters fought to put out a
small forest fire near this metropolis.
	   The fire has only burned about eight hectares (20 acres) of
forest in Beykoz district on the Anatolian side of the city but
authorities worried that strong winds could spread the blaze.
	   There was no immediate danger of the fire reaching populated
areas. Some 10 million people live in this city, split into
European and Asian sides by the narrow waterway linking the Black
Sea and the Mediterranean.
	   A helicopter was used to drop water on the blaze, whose cause
was not immediately known.

Amsterdam exchange nosedives to close down 5.1 percent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Dutch stocks hardest hit. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Prices on the Amsterdam Stock
Exchange skydived Thursday, closing down 5.1 percent after falling
all day and tumbling further as Wall Street foundered.
	   Traders blamed Wall Street's woes, the lower dollar and
continuing worries about the situation in Russia and Asia.
	   Investors also said the market was increasingly concerned about
the financial situation in Latin America and the political troubles
of U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   The 27-share AEX Index finished at 1021.31 points, down 55.28
points or 5.1 percent after dipping to as low as 1012.31 points. On
Wednesday, the AEX had closed down 1.7 percent at the final bell.
	   The continuing fall of the dollar also hurt the Amsterdam
bourse. At 1432 GMT, the U.S. currency was at 1.9121 guilders from
1.9395 guilders late Wednesday.
	   The Dutch stock market is highly dollar-sensitive because a
number of index companies derive much of their overseas revenues in
dollars.
	   As has happened often in the past volatile weeks, financial
stocks were the hardest-hit.
	   Shares of leading Dutch bank ABN Amro closed down 6.5 percent,
ING bank plunged 8.5 percent, Fortis ended the day 3.4 percent
lower and insurer Aegon closed down 3.5 percent.
	   Anglo-Dutch consumer products giant Unilever, which on Wednesday
disclosed heavy sales losses in Russia because of the economic and
political turmoil there, closed down 6.4 percent Thursday.

Russia's young democracy may be the real winner in crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Russia-Politics &QL; 
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY RENFREW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The real winner in the battle between Boris
Yeltsin and the parliament over who runs Russia may turn out to the
nation's young democracy.
	   A political crisis that threatened to plunge Russia into chaos
appears to have been resolved peacefully. The president agreed to
compromise. All of the main political factions wanted a peaceful
solution. And the long-suffering Russian people once again were
patient.
	   The government can expect at least a brief political truce to
tackle the country's other crisis _ the economic meltdown that
already has caused enormous damage and setback Russia's hopes of
progress.
	   Yeltsin's decision Thursday to nominate his foreign minister,
Yevgeny Primakov, as prime minister was hailed by all sides with
huge relief. All sides predicted swift legislative approval for
Primakov.
	   It could have been a very different outcome. Yeltsin had said he
would insist on nominating Viktor Chernomyrdin for a third and
final time after he was twice rejected by the Duma, the lower
chamber of parliament.
	   If the Communist-dominated Duma had rejected Chernomyrdin a
third time, Yeltsin would have had to dissolve the chamber and call
parliamentary elections. Or he could have declared a state of
emergency, saying the crisis was too grave for elections, and ruled
the world's largest country by decree.
	   For the past two weeks, Russians were recalling the 1993
confrontation between Yeltsin and hard-line lawmakers that ended in
bloody street battles in Moscow. People also recalled the failed
1991 coup by Soviet hard-liners, as they speculated about Yeltsin
or his opponents bringing in the military or the military seizing
power in its own name.
	   It was a frightening time, but now Russia has a breathing space.
	   Primakov has little chance of finding a quick fix to Russia's
economic problems, which are the result of years of mismanagement
and neglect. He is at least a competent and honest administrator, a
rare entity in modern Russia, and he will try to restore confidence
in the government.
	   Many Russians believe the market reforms intended to transform
Russia are a disaster because the quality of their lives has only
declined. Reformers say there has been little real reform because
the Yeltsin government is mired in corruption and incompetence.
	   The struggle for Russia is far from finished. The Communists and
their allies have strong popular support and still hanker for the
Soviet past.
	   The democratic reformers are disunited and weak, lacking strong
popular support. The opposition will see Yeltsin's concession as a
sign of weakness and push him to cede at least some of his sweeping
powers.
	   But Yeltsin has compromised in the past, only to bounce back. He
still controls the government and has not given up any power. He
has little popular support, but that has been true for years.
	   For most Russians, the important thing is that the political
struggle for control of the government be through the ballot box.

Manchester United, Arsenal focus on the field
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN PYE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ While media takeovers of Premier League giants
Manchester United and Arsenal have dominated English soccer this
week, attention should return to the field Saturday.
	   Manchester United's new 12.6 million-pound (dlrs 20 million)
signing Dwight Yorke stole the show Wednesday with his first two
goals at Old Trafford, proving that soccer fans simply want to see
their team win.
	   A jubilant Yorke jumped into a crowd of adoring fans after
socring during Manchester United's 4-1 win over Charlton.
	   The win, and Yorke's endeavors, quelled threatened violent
demonstrations by fans angry at BSkyB's 623 million-pound (dlrs 1
billion) proposed takeover of the club announced earlier that day.
	   Banners and T-shirts attacking Rupert Murdoch and his satellite
television company were the only visible signs of the off-field
discontent as fans celebrated the Red Devils' first win this
season.
	   Manchester United plays Coventry at Old Trafford on Saturday,
while Arsenal, which became subject of a takeover bid by the
Carlton media group on Thursday, travels to Leicester.
	   The Gunners were lucky to escape with a 0-0 tie against Chelsea
at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday, on the eve of the Carlton
negotiations being made public.
	   But the League and FA Cup double titlist has the players to keep
Arsenal fans concentrating on the field.
	   French World Cup star Emmanuel Petit and Dutch pair Dennis
Bergkamp and Mark Overmars are all available and will put special
emphasis on breaking Arsenal's three-game run of ties with a win
over Leicester.
	   Liverpool goes into Saturday's match against West Ham with one
problem: Who should partner 18-year-old England striker Michael
Owen up front?
	   The new coaching combination of Roy Evans and Gerard Houllier is
working so well that Liverpool has shot to the top of the League
standings, is undefeated after four rounds and leads the
goal-scoring.
	   The problem is an abundance of choices.
	   Owen, the Premier League's leading goal-scorer, has been
successfully paired with German striker Karlheinz Reidle in the
first four matches but the return of former England striker Robbie
Fowler has created a selection dilemma.
	   Fowler returned from injury this week with six goals in
Liverpool's 9-0 win over Wrexham in a friendly. He is certain to
make a return within the next week.
	   West Ham goes into the match after an amazing 4-3 loss against
Wimbledon on Wimbledon.
	   The Hammers led 3-0 after 26 minutes, after John Hartson opened
the scoring in the sixth minute and Ian Wright scored two in quick
succession. But Wimbledon equalized late in the second half and
clinched it with an Efan Ekoku goal with seven minutes remaining.
	   The Dons, among the relegations favorites this season, moved
into fourth place in the standings and booked a top-five showdown
with Aston Villa, currently No. 2 in the league, at Villa Park.
	   Aston Villa goes into the match without record signing Stan
Collymore, who is still sidelined with a thigh injury, but should
field Paul Merson, who signed from Middlesbrough this week.
	   Chelsea, still yet to register a win this season, takes on
Nottingham Forest at Stamford Bridge.
	   The Blues, defending League Cup and European Cup Winners' Cup
titlists, have only scored six league wins since Gianluca Vialli
replaced Ruud Gullit as coach last season.
	   Vialli, who went on a multi-million dollar recruitment drive on
the off-season and signed Brian Laudrup, Pierluigi Casiraghi,
Albert Ferrer and Marcel Desailly, is languishing in 18th place and
must beat Forest to put its campaign back on the rails.
	   In other matches Saturday, Charlton hosts Derby, Sheffield
Wednesday plays Blackburn and, in a bottom-of-the-league battle,
Newcastle takes on Southampton.
	   Newcastle and England captain Alan Shearer goes into the
Southampton match without scoring a goal in his last 10 league
outings, although he did score England's goal in a 2-1 loss to
Sweden last Saturday.
	   Newcastle's new coach, Gullit, who replaced Kenny Dalglish two
weeks ago, said Shearer was becoming increasingly frustrated at not
being given any opportunities.
	   Gullit said Newcastle did not do enough with its chances in a
1-0 loss to Aston Villa on Wednesday.
	   ``We got into positions to create something but then didn't do
what we had to do. Alan is getting frustrated and I can understand
that but we know what he is capable of and we will work on
things,'' Gullit said.
	   On Sunday, Middlesbrough travels to White Hart Lane to take on
Tottenham.
	   Middlesbrough scored its first win of the season with a 1-0 win
over Leicester on Paul Gascoigne's first goal for Boro in the
Premier League.
	   David Pleat, temporary fill-in for sacked head coach Christian
Gross, steered Spurs to its second successive victory on Wednesday
with a 2-1 win over Blackburn. Spurs have jumped from 19th to 8th
in the standings.

UEFA president: Super League would kill soul of football
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos IST101, IST103 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ UEFA president Lennart Johansson warned
Thursday that the proposed breakaway European Super League would
destroy ``the soul of football.''
	   Johansson, visiting Turkey to join in the celebrations marking
the 75th anniversary of the republic, reiterated that UEFA would
never accept a private venture.
	   ``Our matches should be shown all over the world on free
television. I doubt that we will go for a pay-per-view system,''
the semi-official Anatolia news agency quoted Johansson as saying.
``We have to think about the people.''
	   He was also voiced concerns over the morality of the proposed
Super League plan.
	   ``There is a risk that the soul of football...is getting lost
and if something like this should happen we will all suffer,'' he
said. ``People on the streets, the spectators, the fans, the clubs,
all are against a break-up of a few from the football family.''
	   UEFA, European soccer's governing body, has said that plans for
a breakaway super league endanger European soccer's credibility and
discriminate against East Europe.
	   ``Small teams should not be forgotten. We are serving all
Europe,'' Johansson said.
	   A Milan-based marketing firm Media Partners hopes to form a
Super League by 2001 involving the biggest names in European
soccer, including Bayern Munich, Ajax, Inter and AC Milan,
Manchester United and Arsenal.
	   Johansson expressed confidence he will get FIFA's support in
stopping the breakaway league.
	   ``We can't win the game with threats, we are aware of that,''
Johansson said. ``But UEFA and FIFA would not allow some certain
things.''
	   UEFA plans to head off the breakaway by reforming its own club
competitions.
	   Commenting on the dlrs 1 billion takeover bid by Rupert
Murdoch's BSkyB of Manchester United, Johansson repeated his
concerns about commercialization.
	   ``It is when (media companies) interfere in the sporting
criteria that I get worried,'' he said. ``Otherwise I am not here
to criticize Mr. Murdoch. I think he knows what he is doing.''

 &UR; New exodus of Kosovo refugees flee Serb tanks, shells
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with refugee situation, CHANGES

<TEXT>
	   ISTINIC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ An estimated 25,000 ethnic Albanian
civilians crowded Thursday into this small village in southwestern
Kosovo, terrified they would be caught in a pincer strike by Serb
troops and tanks that blasted their villages.
	   Village elders said at least five people _ including two infants
_ had died Wednesday of sickness or wounds suffered while fleeing
the Serb onslaught.
	   A 16-year-old boy lay on the floor of a house, hiding for fear
he would be caught by Serb police patrols. A gaping wound -- which
he said he received when a policeman shot him -- exposed his
intestines.
	   The refugees were the latest victims of the crackdown on ethnic
Albanians in the Serbian province. They fled on tractors and wagons
heaped with their belongings, clogging a dirt road Wednesday in a
column 11 kilometers (seven miles) long, according to Western
observers who visited the area.
	   In a news release Wednesday, U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, based in Geneva, warned it ``fears slaughter may occur if
a shell hits the column of people.''
	   Kosovo is in southern Serbia, the dominant of two republics left
in the Yugoslav Federation. Its population is 90 percent ethnic
Albanian, most of whom back the rebels' armed struggle for
independence after decades of repression by Serbian authorities.
	   One official said the current refugee situation threatens to
create as many as 25 new ghost towns in Kosovo, where dozens of
villages already have been charred or emptied during shelling or
clashes between Serb security forces and the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   Fernando del Mundo, a UNHCR spokesman, estimated the number of
refugees here at up to 25,000. They were clustered Thursday in
groups of several thousand here, several thousand there, strung out
along roads and crowded into homes in this village.
	   Rrok Berisha, a member of Kosovo's unathorized parliament, said
he had been trapped here for three days. He feared the number of
refugees in the area could reach 100,000 as police cleared more
villages.
	   The chaotic exodus began Tuesday from villages in an area about
30 kilometers (20 miles) south of Pec, Kosovo's second-largest
city.
	   ``They're panicking and going everywhere, but they don't know
which way to go,'' said del Mundo, who heard shelling and saw
billows of smoke Wednesday. ``The shelling is closing in like a
pincer.''
	   Tens of thousands of others remain dangerously close to the
shelling and may also soon flee, he said, increasing the estimated
265,000 refugees.
	   The United Nations estimated this week that 600 to 700 civilians
have been killed in six months of fighting between Serb-led forces
and Kosovo Albanian rebels.
	   While world leaders have condemned the Serbs for killing
civilians and for their scorched-earth tactics targeting ethnic
Albanian villages, the Serbs also accuse the militants of
massacring Serb civilians.
	   Western officials have held out the threat of military
intervention for months if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
doesn't halt the offensive. But such plans have been stymied by
lack of international consensus and by the difficulty of military
action in the mountainous region.
	   NATO's southern European commander, Adm. T. Joseph Lopez, said
Wednesday that the alliance would need about 50,000 troops to
monitor a possible peace agreement or cease-fire in Kosovo.
	   Western officials fear the worst if urgent help isn't provided
for the 50,000 or so refugees now living in the hills and forests
and facing starvation or freezing.
	   ``If something isn't done soon, we can expect a humanitarian
drama within weeks,'' Belgian Foreign Minister Erik Derycke said in
Pristina after meeting with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   President Bill Clinton released dlrs 20 million in aid for
Kosovo refugees Wednesday. The White House said the money, added to
an earlier U.S. contribution of dlrs 11 million, will go to U.N.
and private agencies providing food and shelter for refugees.
	   But a U.S. State Department official said no amount of aid will
help unless the Serbian government allows secure access to the
area.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army, meanwhile, criticized the United
States and Rugova for supporting a peace proposal that the group
says does nothing for its cause: independence.
	   Last week, U.S. envoy Christopher Hill won agreement in
principle by both Milosevic and Rugova on an interim settlement
that would grant Kosovo self-rule rather than independence.
	   In a statement published today by the daily Koha Ditore, the
guerrilla group said the deal is ``aimed at demobilizing the masses
who have joined the liberation war ... (and) destruction of the
KLA.''

France bans hazing in schools, opens hot line
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARILYN AUGUST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - Worried that you're the victim of abusive hazing?
Concerned for the physical and mental well-being of a youngster
subjected to silly, and sometimes sadistic initiation rites by
upperclassmen at top French schools?
	   Starting Thursday, students and parents can call a government
hot line for help when hazing's gone wild.
	   A new law passed last week has made hazing illegal for the first
time since Napoleon established it to form a lifelong ``esprit de
corps'' among fresh-faced army recruits.
	   Sponsored by Segolene Royal, deputy minister for school affairs,
the law makes hazing a criminal offense punishable by six months in
prison and fines of 50,000 francs (dlrs 8,330).
	   ``Bizutage,'' as the French call it, has for centuries disrupted
the lives of first-year university students.
	   Mostly, the practices are harmless: panhandling wearing garbage
bags and smeared in shaving cream, or playing catch with raw eggs
and flour.
	   But increasingly violent practices have emerged in recent years,
especially in military academies and medical schools which have
long been notorious for rough-and-tumble hazing that some say
borders on organized assault, mental abuse and attempted rape.
	   It hasn't taken long for the ban to take effect.
	   Stanilas, an elite private high school in Paris, was forced to
cancel its annual ``orientation'' week.
	   National engineering schools are developing constructive hazing
practices in the wake of last year's debacle: two schools were shut
after students were found locked in rooms during the weekend and
forced to walk at a snail's pace hugging the walls.
	   This year's hazing will take freshmen into poor neighborhoods to
work with underprivileged children, according to Guy Gautherin,
director general of the Ecole Nationale Superieure des Arts et des
Metiers, a mechanical engineering school.
	   In Lyon, 8,000 university students have joined forces with a
charity to help renovate inner-city slums and find jobs for their
inhabitants.

UN chief warns U.N. could leave Angola by February if situation
</HEADLINE>
worsens &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. chief warned Thursday that U.N.
military observers could leave Angola by February if the government
and former rebels UNITA fail to stop fighting and immediately
implement the deteriorating 1994 peace accord.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan recommended the Security Council
conduct a full-scale review by the end of November of the situation
in the southwestern African nation and the presence there of the
U.N. Military Observers in Angola, or MONUA.
	   ``If at the time of the November review, it appears there has
been no substantial progress towards full compliance by the parties
with their respective obligations ... the reduction of MONUA would
be accelerated with a view to closing it down by early February
1999,'' Annan said in a report to the council.
	   If decisive progress was made, the U.N. force would be allowed
to continue its mandate, and may be given additional resources if
required, he said.
	   Holding out hope that such progress was possible, Annan
recommended the force's mandate be extended through Jan. 31.
	   The council was beginning discussions on the report Thursday.
	   Angola's peace process has been crumbling recently, with a surge
in fighting. Tensions mounted last week after the government said
it was severing all contact with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi.
	   UNITA fought a civil war against the government for nearly two
decades after Angola's 1975 independence from Portugal. A
U.N.-mediated 1994 accord, called the Lusaka Protocol, ended the
fighting but the United Nations says UNITA has resisted
implementing it, particularly by refusing to hand over four key
territories and demobilize its troops.
	   The current situation in the country had deteriorated sharply,
Annan said, adding that both parties ``seem to be preparing
themselves for a confrontation.''
	   The government's decision to sever contact with Savimbi ``raised
doubts about the prospects for national reconciliation, without
which there can be no lasting peace,'' Annan said.
	   The involvement of Angolan forces in the civil war in the Congo
has further complicated the situation, Annan said.
	   He urged both sides, but particularly UNITA, to stop fighting
and implement the U.N.-mediated 1994 peace accord.
	   He called on the government to ``establish an effective and
security environment in which UNITA would have no reason to fear
the consequences of its transformation into a genuine political
party.''

	   ROME (AP) _ Italian and French police Thursday captured one of
Italy's leading fugitives, financier Licio Gelli, who had been
convicted in a huge banking scandal, Italy's interior minister
announced Thursday.
	   RAI state TV said Gelli was wearing a false beard and carrying
false documents when he was arrested in Cannes, a French resort
near the Italian border. The 79-year-old financier was in the
company of his son, the report said.
	   French police in Nice said Gelli was hospitalized after
suffering a minor heart problem.

Romanian government imposes taxes to make extra revenue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Seeking to fill the country's emptying
coffers, the government on Thursday said it would levy extra taxes
on goods from cigarettes to newspapers.
	   For the past months, the government has been looking for ways to
bring in extra revenue to prevent a steep downturn in the economy,
which likely will shrink by four percent this year, a government
official said.
	   Foreign and domestic investment has stalled due to uncertainties
about stalled market reforms and political feuding. Purchasing
power has declined and the Romanian currency, the leu, has been
overvalued in recent years.
	   An extra tax of three percent will be slapped on all imports and
excise taxes for cigarettes and alcohol will be doubled, to try and
rein in the 1998 budget deficit, the government said.
	   It will also apply an 11 percent value added tax to books and
publications, which has caused outrage among publishers.
Previously, they were exempt from the value added tax.
	   The measures come into effect on Oct. 1. Budget expenditures
were also slashed by lei 7.5 trillion (dlrs 833 million), a measure
needed to keep the deficit at 4 percent said Dan Radu Rusanu, a
state secretary at the Ministry of Finance.
	   Rusanu said the government was forced to make the adjustments
due to the slumping Romanian economy, which he estimated would
contract by 4 percent this year
	   He said that inflation for this year would be 4rcent, slightly
lower than predicted.
	   Rusanu said companies using Romanian tobacco would be granted a
large tax reduction.

European union commissioner thinks Primakov can help pull Russia

 &UR; With Moscow - Russia Politics &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Yevgeny Primakov is a ``trustworthy
and highly competent'' man whose leadership would help begin to
solve Russia's economic woes, Hans van den Broek, the European
Union foreign affairs commissioner said Thursday.
	   ``It would be the first significant step in solving Russia's
crisis,'' said van den Broek, adding he thought it likely the
Russian Duma would approve Primakov as prime minister.
	   Van den Broek said he had a friendly telephone conversation with
Primakov on Wednesday. He did not reveal what they talked about.
Primakov is currently acting foreign minister.
	   ``Primakov is making a self-sacrifice in taking this job,'' said
van den Broek at a news conference in Bucharest. ``As a foreign
minister he is known as highly competent and trustworthy person.''
	   He said that if Primakov's government program which needs the
Duma's approval, forges ahead with reforms, then Russia will regain
the confidence of the international community.
	   The EU official is in Romania on a two-day visit to analyze the
pace of economic and democratic reforms. He will make a report in
November about Romania's progress in its E.U. membership bid.

Ross, Netanyahu meet; U.S. weighing whether to start draft

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli and Palestinian leaders signaled
readiness to move forward on a deal for a West Bank troop
withdrawal, though many differences remain, U.S. peace envoy Dennis
Ross said Thursday.
	   Ross held talks Thursday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
and with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Wednesday evening.
Ross said his mission would continue for at least several more
days.
	   ``I'm seeing whether or not it's possible to narrow the
differences,'' Ross told reporters today after briefing Israeli
President Ezer Weizman. ``The initial sets of discussions, I think,
have indicated the desire to try to find ways.''
	   However, Weizman, when asked whether he was more optimistic
after hearing from Ross, answered with a curt: ``No.''
	   The U.S. envoy will now decide whether to start drafting at
least part of a pullback agreement, a U.S. official said on
condition of anonymity.
	   Ross is accompanied by Jonathan Schwartz, a State Department
legal adviser who drafted the 1997 agreement on an Israeli
withdrawal from most of the West Bank town of Hebron.
	   The Haaretz daily newspaper said Ross hopes to get something on
paper by the weekend, but some issues will have to be finalized at
the highest levels, perhaps at a summit later this month when
Netanyahu, Arafat and President Bill Clinton attend the U.N.
General Assembly in New York.
	   On the table is a U.S. proposal for an Israeli withdrawal from
13 percent of the West Bank and detailed provisions for Palestinian
cooperation with Israel and the United States on security.
	   Israel initially rejected a 13 percent pullback, then said it
would agree provided that 3 percent of that area is declared a
nature reserve in which Israel retains security control and the
Palestinians are not allowed to build.
	   The Palestinians have said they would accept temporary
restrictions, but want assurances the area eventually would be
under full Palestinian control.
	   Asked about the Palestinian demands, Netanyahu's adviser David
Bar-Illan said Thursday: ``We don't believe that would be an
obstacle. The main thing is that we would have security control and
the veto on construction, which would prevent the building of
military installations.''
	   The most difficult issue facing Ross is Israel's demand to
renegotiate an agreement on security cooperation.
	   A blueprint for Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation and a
Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants was worked out by
Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. security officials in December, but
was rejected by Netanyahu as insufficient.
	   The Palestinians initially said they would not agree to changes,
but in recent days have softened their position.
	   The Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot said the Palestinians would
consider renegotiating the security understanding, provided that
Israel agreed to all elements of the U.S. peace initiative,
including proposals on how to determine the size of an additional
withdrawal.
	   Also Thursday, a Palestinian woman hurt during clashes in a
Jerusalem refugee camp died of her wounds. The woman, 41-year-old
Kamila Nather, was walking in the street on Saturday when she was
struck in the face by a rubber-coated steel pellet fired by Israeli
troops trying to disperse Palestinian stone throwers.

Head of Orthodox Church says earrings acceptable for young men
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Archbishop Christodoulos has told young
men it's all right with him if they wear earrings when they see
their pastors _ as long as they do visit.
	   ``Don't take anything off, not even the earring from your ear.
You are our children, no matter how you look, and that's enough for
us. We can work things out, as long as we meet,'' the head of the
Orthodox Church of Greece said Thursday.
	   The message, part of an address to high school students, was
issued one day before the start of the new academic year.
	   It was a surprising call coming from the head of the Orthodox
Church, often considered a bastion of conservatism. Orthodox
priests here are still required to have beards, wear black robes
and stove pipe hats.
	   The message also came just two days after Christodoulos called
on Greeks to end discrimination against people infected with AIDS,
after making the first ever visit to a treatment center by a head
of the Church.
	   ``We can discuss anything. The tragic dead ends of our society,
the uplifting of our hearts, the lack of love, drugs, AIDS and
violence,'' Christodoulos said in his address.

Woody Allen movie shown at Venice Film Festival

<TEXT>
	   VENICE, Italy (AP) _ Woody Allen loves Venice, but this year the
actor-director was not here to attend the world premiere Thursday
of ``Celebrity,'' his latest film.
	   The out-of-competition, black-and-white film, set in Allen's
beloved Manhattan, tells the story of a journalist and his
relations with women -- his wife and others -- through a string of
encounters with various celebrities who turn out to be as insane
and vacuous as the society which acclaims them.
	   Allen does not star in this movie but cast a group of real stars
-- Kenneth Branagh, Melanie Griffith, Leonardo DiCaprio, Winona

North Korea wants U.S. compensation for missile charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ North Korea on Thursday said it deserved
compensation from the United States for ``slander, insult and
defamation'' for accusing it of firing a ballistic missile last
week.
	   North Korea claims that what was launched Aug. 31 was a
scientific satellite. U.S. and Japanese officials say it was a
ballistic missile, believed to be the new Taepo Dong 1, that soared
over Japan and fell into the Pacific Ocean.
	   The North's official Korean Central News Agency quoted a Foreign
Ministry spokesman as commenting on the recent talks in New York
between the United States and the isolationist communist state.
	   The KCNA report also accused the United States of reneging on
promises it made in a 1994 agreement that America, along with
Japan, Europe and South Korea, would help North Korea build nuclear
power plants. In exchange, North Korea was supposed to halt its
suspected nuclear weapons program.
	   Charles Kartman, who was leading the U.S. side in the talks, has
said progress was made on the main issues.
	   During the talks, North Korea told the U.S. negotiators that it
has the right to launch a satellite, KCNA said. And if the missile
is found to be nonmilitary, the United States must compensate the
North, it said.
	   The report did not say what the compensation might be.
	   ``At the talks, we emphasized that in case such an incident
occurs again, irrevocable consequences may arise,'' KCNA said.
	   KCNA also said that Washington agreed in the talks to consider
more food aid for North Korea and start discussions on removing the
communist country from the annual State Department list of nations
that engage in state-sponsored terrorism.
	   In return, North Korea promised to resume talks aimed at curbing
missile sales to Middle East countries, it said.
	   The talks were intended to review progress on the North's 1994
agreement to refrain from nuclear weapons development in return for
two Western-built light-water energy reactors and fuel-oil
shipments from Washington.
	   North Korea has complained that Washington is not holding up its
end of the 1994 agreement by providing 500,000 tons of heavy fuel
oil each year.
	   Less than half the annual supply has been shipped this year, and
North Korea says the shipment is behind schedule.

Russia's Security Council chief fired
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Politics &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Amid Russia's political turmoil, President Boris
Yeltsin dismissed Security Council chief Andrei Kokoshin on
Thursday _ a man previously seen as well-liked by both the
president's staff and the opposition.
	   Neither the Kremlin nor Security Council officials would comment
on the dismissal. Yeltsin's decree used a standard formula, saying
that Kokoshin was relieved of his duties for ``transfer to another
post.'' The statement did not name the new post.
	   Kokoshin had held the security council job since May, when
Yeltsin merged the Defense Council and the State Military
Inspectorate into the powerful Security Council, and named him to
head it.
	   The official role of the Russian Security Council is to advise
the president although it has also handled federal relations with
Russia's regions. In the past, the Security Council was the main
organization in charge of Russia's negotiations with secessionist
Chechnya.
	   Kokoshin's dismissal came on the same day Yeltsin nominated
acting Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov as prime minister. It was
not clear whether the two personnel decisions were connected.

Pesticides and chemicals are target of new treaty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Aiming to protect people and the
environment in developing countries, representatives from 80
nations prepared Thursday to sign a new treaty tightening rules on
pesticides and other hazardous chemicals.
	   The international treaty, sponsored by the U.N. Environment
Program and the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, requires
companies to get official government permission before exporting
such material.
	   Those expected to sign the treaty Friday include the United
States, Britain, Germany, Japan, Canada, Australia and Switzerland
_ all major exporters.
	   If a country signs the agreement, chemical companies based there
will have to provide information on the health and environmental
risks of 22 pesticides and five industrial chemicals, including the
pesticide DDT.
	   Currently, there are about 70,000 chemicals on the market. The
treaty is intended to protect developing nations who cannot control
all of the chemicals entering their borders.
	   Many pesticides that are banned or restricted in industrialized
countries, such as DDT, are still being marketed to developing
nations, said Ennelie Kohl of the Dutch environment ministry.
	   ``This treaty is very important, especially for developing
countries,'' Kohl said.
	   The Swiss-based World Wildlife Fund applauded the agreement,
saying it will protect both the environment and the people _ the
farmers, workers and consumers _ in developing countries.
	   ``It's good to see that governments are committed to making
trade in hazardous chemicals a more transparent, informed,
consensual process,'' said Clifton Curtis, toxic campaigns director
for the WWF.
	   But the group warned that the treaty will not work in developing
countries that produce their own hazardous chemicals or lack
effective regulations.
	   The WWF also urged governments to make a global commitment to
phasing out and eliminating the most hazardous chemicals and
pesticides.
	   Developing countries made a strong showing at the treaty
conference that began Thursday. All African countries were
represented, Kohl said, and almost all of them sent ministers to
sign the agreement on Friday.
	   After the representatives sign the treaty, a minimum of 50
countries must then ratify it before it can take effect. This is
expected to take about two years.

Media group confirms talks with Arsenal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with joint statement confirming possible takeover;
latest figure for club's value &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ First Manchester United, now Arsenal.
	   One day after United's board accepted a record dlrs 1 billion
takeover bid from Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB television, Arsenal said
it was considering a possible buyout by another TV company.
	   In a joint statement, Arsenal and Carlton Communications said
they were holding ``very preliminary discussions'' on ways of
working together.
	   ``These talks are too preliminary in nature to assess the
probability of any outcome,'' the statement said. ``One possible
outcome could be an offer being made by Carlton for Arsenal.''
	   The London Evening Standard said the talks involved a possible
275-million-pound (dlrs 459.2 million) takeover.
	   The announcement came a day after the board of Manchester United
accepted a 623-million-pound (dlrs 1 billion) bid from BSkyB, the
highest amount ever paid for a sports franchise.
	   The Manchester United takeover, which still needs approval by
the club's shareholders and government regulators, sparked
speculation of the possibility of a series of takeovers of soccer
teams by media companies.
	   ``After yesterday's Manchester United deal, the big clubs are
realizing it is better to pick your partner and be one of the first
in, rather than hang around,'' said William Davies, a soccer
analyst with London stockbroker Albert E. Sharp.
	   While some Manchester United fans have vowed to fight the
proposed Murdoch takeover, there was a sense of inevitability among
Arsenal fans gathered outside the club's Highbury stadium Thursday
in north London.
	   ``I suppose now that Manchester United have done it, we have to
as well,'' teenage student Lynette Dowden said. ``But it's all
about money these days. It's not the football that matters any
more.''
	   Shelley Johnson, a 21-year-old student teacher, concurred.
	   ``I don't particularly like it, but if Manchester United get all
the money from Sky they might run away with everything. We've got
to compete somehow.''
	   Along with Manchester United and Liverpool, Arsenal is one of
the clubs which could take part in a proposed European Super League
starting in 2000.
	   A lucrative takeover could help the club finance a new stadium
to replace Highbury, which has a capacity of just 38,000 and is
considered too small to meet current demand.
	   The current Arsenal team is coached by Frenchman Arsene Wenger
and features a lineup of international stars including Dutch
striker Dennis Bergkamp and French World Cup winners Patrick Vieira
and Emmanuel Petit.
	   Wenger said Thursday he was unaware of the talks with Carlton
but understood if fans were worried about the prospect of their
club being run by a media company.
	   ``Their concern is that the people who own their club should
also love it,'' he said. ``They don't want it to just become a
business. It is the history of football in England that club owners
are in the game for things other than business reasons, but the
game is changing all the time of course.''
	   Wenger warned that smaller clubs could be left out if England's
elite teams are bought up by the media.
	   ``The worry is that the rules of the game could change if four
or five clubs have owners from the media,'' he said. ``They would
have the power to make life really impossible for the other
teams.''
	   The Gunners played a 0-0 tie with London rival Chelsea on
Wednesday night. They travel to Leicester on Saturday and open
their European Champions League campaign next week against French
side Lens.
	   Arsenal is listed on the Ofex stock exchange, smaller and more
informal than the principal London stock market.
	   On Wednesday, the club was valued at 162.4 million pounds (dlrs
271 million). After the announcement of the talks with Carlton,
shares soared Thursday and the club was revalued at 224 million
pounds (dlrs 374 million).
	   There are 56,000 shares in Arsenal. The club is run by chairman
Peter Hill-Wood and vice chairman David Dein.
	   Carlton Communications owns the Carlton Television company in
London and the Midland's Central Television and Westcountry
Television.
	   The group is a major seller of advertising airtime on TV and
cinema, and a 50 percent partner with Granada Group in ON Digital,
the digital TV consortium.
	   While Carlton is smaller than Murdoch's media empire, it has the
television franchise for London as well as a number of others
across Britain.
	   Financial experts now expect Liverpool, Newcastle and possibly
Chelsea to be the next clubs sought after by media companies.
	   Granada, which owns TV franchises in both the Liverpool and
Newcastle area, is considered a potential bidder.

	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Supermodel Claudia Schiffer appeared
Thursday at the opening of a new 45-kilometer (28 mile) stretch of
highway along with Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, who is seeking
re-election this month.
	   The Slovak News Agency said Schiffer cut the ribbon during the
opening ceremony near Nove Mesto nad Vahom in northwestern
Slovakia. She was invited by Meciar's Movement for a Democratic
Slovakia, which faces national elections Sept. 25-26.
	   According to the agency, Schiffer said through a translator that
``the person that will vote for number one will not make
mistakes.'' Meciar's party refers to itself as ``number one'' in
the campaign.
	   Schiffer's visit to Slovakia was kept in secret until Thursday.
Her presence surprised the 3,000 to 4,000 people that came to the
ceremonial opening. Schiffer stood by Meciar during the ceremony.
	   Meciar plans to open more highways next week, with the well
known French actor Jean Paul Belmondo, according to the Slovak
independent radio Twist.

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ African and U.N. leaders, alarmed
by an escalation of fighting in Congo, Thursday made a third
attempt at achieving peace in the embattled country.
	   Leaders from neighboring countries embroiled in Congo's civil
war met for a two-day peace conference in the Ethiopian capital of
Addis Ababa to negotiate an immediate cease-fire and withdrawal of
foreign troops.
	   ``The fact that we are meeting ... attests to the seriousness
with which the issues before us should be tackled,'' Zambian
Defense Minister Chitalu Sampa said in brief remarks before the
press was excluded.
	   Sampa said the negotiators also would try to set up a method for
ensuring all parties, including foreign troops, comply with the
cease-fire. Kabila was on the verge of defeat before Angola,
Namibia and Zimbabwe sent help.
	   But it was unclear how the negotiations could be effective
because the rebels trying to oust Congolese President Laurent
Kabila were excluded.
	   A Congolese rebel delegation angrily abandoned negotiations
Tuesday in Zimbabwe, just before a draft of a cease-fire agreement
was expected to be signed. Fighting immediately surged in eastern
Congo.
	   Rebel-run Radio Bukavu said insurgents and government-backed
militiamen clashed near Bukavu, a lakeside town on the border with
Rwanda.
	   Refugees fleeing across Lake Tanganyika to Tanzania told U.N.
workers that the government recaptured the southeastern town of
Kalemie on Wednesday.
	   Neither report could be confirmed independently.
	   The rebels trying to unseat Congo's year-old government claim
Kabila has failed to implement democratic reforms and has worsened
ethnic hatred.
	   Kabila's government asked Zimbabwe to arrest the eight-member
rebel delegation which flew to Victoria Falls for the unsuccessful
peace talks on Tuesday, the Financial Gazette reported Thursday.
Justice Minister Emmerson Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe had no
jurisdiction to so so.
	   Among those attending the latest two-day peace conference, which
ends Friday, were government ministers of Zimbabwe, Angola and
Namibia, whose armies have backed Kabila. Congo also sent its
defense minister.
	   Also participating were the representatives of Uganda and
Rwanda, which supported Kabila's ouster of dictator Mobutu Sese
Seko. Kabila claims they are now helping the rebels, but Rwanda
denies the charge. Uganda admits it has troops in Congo, but says
they are only protecting its borders from attack by Ugandan rebels.
	   Zambia, which has remained neutral but borders Congo, sent Sampa
to act as chairman.
	   OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim was host of the latest
round of peace talks. A four-member team of U.N. advisers was led
by Berhanu Dinka, representing U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   The failed summit in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe marked the third
formal attempt at a peace deal since the conflict began Aug. 2, and
the only time rebels were invited.

University says it is not cooperating with Cuban hospital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ An U.S.-owned university operating
in Grenada and the island's government said a statement that the
school was cooperating with a Cuban hospital to train students was
a ``simple mistake.''
	   A press release from the office of Prime Minister Keith Mitchell
caused an uproar by stating _ incorrectly _ that students at the
St. George's University School of Medicine was sending students to
Havana for medical training.
	   After the assassination of the Prime Minister Maurice Bishop in
1983, the United States invaded Grenada to restore order and oust
Cubans building an airstrip on the Caribbean island. One of the
reasons for the invasion given by the administration of U.S.
President Ronald Reagan was to protect the lives of the U.S.
students at St. George's.
	   Because of that history, relations with Cuba remain a touchy
political topic in Grenada. Some protested a visit by Cuban
President Fidel Castro on Aug. 2-3.
	   The university said the statement that it was cooperating with a
Cuban hospital was mistakenly issued by the prime minister's press
secretary.
	   ``The University does not consider this particular incident to
be anything other than a simple mistake,'' said a statement from
Chancellor Charles Modica. ``The prime minister's press secretary,
working closely with our publicist apologized for the errors and
immediately issued a corrected version.''

German drivers swap teams for 1999 F-1 championship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONZA, Italy (AP) _ Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Ralf Schumacher
will swap places in the 1999 world Formula One championship, with
Frentzen joining Jordan and Schumacher moving to Williams.
	   Eddie Jordan announced in Monza Thursday that Frentzen, leaving
Williams after two seasons, will team with former world champion
Damon Hill at Jordan next year.
	   No financial details were disclosed.
	   Jordan indicated that Ralf Schumacher was moving to Williams but
added it was up to the British team to make the formal
announcement.
	   ``I have two spots free on the team,'' Frank Williams said.
``However we are concentranting on Sunday's race (the Italian GP)
here, rather than on next year's lineup.''
	   The British team is expected to be formed by Ralf Schumacher,
younger brother of Ferrari's two-time world champion Michael, and
Alex Zanardi, the two-time Cart champion who would replace
defending world champion Jacques Villeneuve.
	   Villeneuve, a Canadian, already announced he will be driving
with the new British American racing team next year.
	   Ralf Schumacher, 23, is leaving Jordan after a single season. He
placed second to teammate Damon Hill in the Belgian Grand Prix last
month.
	   ``It wasn't an easy decision for me. But I think that Jordan
will be very strong next season and that they will put together an
interesting package for me,'' Frentzen said.
	   ``I was surprised at the news to have Frentzen with me next
year,'' said Hill. ``It's a smart move to have two guys of
experience. It would boost Jordan's chances in the constructors
standings.''
	   Frentzen, a German like Schumacher, has a single Grand Prix
victory in his F-1 career. Ralf Schumacher has yet to win.

	   BERLIN (AP) _ Goverment officials dismissed on Thursday
suggestions that the arrest of a German terror suspect who was
preparing to turn himself in was an election-year move designed to
embarrass Germany's leftist Green party and aid Chancellor Helmut
Kohl.
	   ``Those are left-wing dirty rumors,'' federal Interior Minister
Manfred Kanther said in denying any political motivation behind the
arrest of Hans-Joachim Klein.
	   The suspect's lawyer, Eberhard Kempf, said Klein _ believed to
be a former accomplice of Cold War terrorist ``Carlos the Jackal''
_ had been negotiating his surrender for months when he was
arrested Tuesday in a cafe in France.
	   ``And with the September 27 (parliamentary) elections just two
weeks away, one starts to wonder,'' Kempf said on German television
Wednesday night.
	   Kempf told The Associated Press on Thursday that he had met
Klein last weekend in Paris and agreed on a surrender date _ Sept.
16 _ but police swept in before he could notify German prosecutors.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's interior minister emerged from a coma
Thursday, a week after he suffered an allergic reaction to
anesthesia durig a gall bladder operation, a Defense Ministry
statement said.
	   Following a reduction in the drugs used to keep him sedated,
Jean-Pierre Chevenement was able to recognize members of his
family, the statement said.
	   Chevenement, a key political ally of Socialist Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin, fell into a coma Sept. 2 after suffering a heart
attack during surgery.
	   The 59-year-old minister, in charge of the nation's police and
security forces, remains on respiratory and kidney dialysis, the
statement said.
	   It confirmed that the allergy was caused by a reaction to curare
in the anesthetic.
	   It said nothing, however, about any lasting neurological damage
he may have suffered.
	   Chevenement has held a number of other ministry portfolios
during his political career, including defense, industry,
education.
	   After three years as defense minister, he resigned in 1991 to
protest France's involvement in the U.S.-led Gulf War coalition
against Iraq.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Thick gray smoke filled the skies over
the Bosporus strait Thursday as firefighters fought to put out
three forest fires near this metropolis.
	   The blazes have burned more than 10 hectares (26 acres) of
forest around the city but authorities worried that strong winds
could spread the fires, whose cause was not immediately known.
	   Environment Minister Imren Aykut did not rule out the
possibility of arson.
	   There were no immediate danger the fires in Sariyer, Kartal and
Beykoz districts would reach populated areas. Some 10 million
people live in this city, split into two by a narrow waterway
linking the Black Sea and the Mediterranean.
	   Helicopters were used to drop water on the blazes.

Greece begins 2004 anti-terrorism preparations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ With Athens scheduled to host the Olympic
Games in 2004, Greece has already begun preparations to prevent a
possible terrorist attack during the event, public order ministry
officials said Thursday.
	   A five-member Greek police committee is studying the security
arrangements of previous Olympics, and members of the armed forces
will also join the body in five months' time, Public Order Ministry
Secretary General Yiannis Papadoyiannakis announced.
	   Papadoyiannakis made the statement during a European conference
which opened here Thursday on the prevention of terrorism during
major sporting and cultural events.
	   Police and security officials from all European Union countries
except Luxembourg are attending the two-day meeting. The conference
took place behind closed doors, with reporters only permitted to
attend the opening.
	   But Greece will not ask for practical assistance from abroad in
policing the Games. ``Security is exclusively and only Greece's
obligation,'' Papadoyiannakis stressed.
	   ``The issue of security is perhaps one of the most important
issues in preparation,'' said Stratis Stratigis, president of the
Athens 2004 organizing committee. ``We live in a secure country,
but we mustn't rule out anything.''
	   Greece is home to November 17, one of the world's most elusive
terrorist groups which has used bombs, guns and missiles to target
American, Greek and Turkish officials and companies.
	   They have killed 22 people since their 1975 assassination of the
CIA station chief in Athens. No arrests have ever been made, and
Greek authorities have never announced they have any suspects.
	   November 17 prefers execution-style shootings, car bombings and
missile attacks against specific targets rather than blind bombings
aimed at the general public.
	   In recent years, Greece has also seen a burgeoning of smaller
terrorist groups, which have been waging firebomb campaigns against
offices and cars belonging to government officials, diplomats,
journalists and foreigners.
	   The attacks are usually carried out late at night and rarely
cause any injuries. No one has been killed by the firebombings.
	   ``We have tragic experiences from events at large sports
meetings,'' Stratigis noted.
	   In the 1972 Munich Olympics, eight Palestinian terrorists
attacked the summer Olympic quarters of the Israeli team. Eleven
Israelis were killed, along with five terrorists and a West German
policeman.
	   One person died and more than 100 others were injured during the
1996 Atlanta Olympics, when a bomb exploded in a park in the
Olympic sports complex.
	   ``Our main aim is, beyond the prevention of any criminal act, to
give the Olympic Games of 2004 a general feeling of security,''
Stratigis said.

Residents of island off Khartoum struggling to save homes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MOHAMED OSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Thousands of Sudanese have fled their
homes to escape the Nile's flood waters, but inhabitants of a river
island are stubbornly piling up sandbags to save hundreds of years
of family heritage.
	   Men, women and children are working along the shore of Tuti
Island in the Blue Nile to shore up a 2.5-meter-high (8-feet-high)
wall of sandbags that stretches four kilometers (2.5 miles).
	   ``This is how we are surviving. For us, Tuti is our lives, our
ancestor ... our home,'' said Abdul-Rahman Jibril, 56, a farmer.
	   The 950-acre (380-hectare) island, just off the capital,
Khartoum, is home to about 25,000 people who first built their
sandbag barrier for floods in 1988. The White and Blue Niles, which
converge just north of Tuti, repeatedly have sent destructive
floods into Sudan in the past half century.
	   On Thursday, the rivers' levels already were above the worst
floods in 1988, which caused dlrs 300 million in damage.
	   Tuti's long-established community stands in contrast to many
homes and shacks along the Nile south of Khartoum _ many of them
rented _ where more than 200,000 people have been driven out by the
rising waters.
	   This year's flood already has caused 40 billion Sudanese pounds
(dlrs 19 million) in damage to homes and farms, and the government
has mobilized military reservists to help battle what it fears
could be Sudan's worst flooding ever.
	   Sharaf Eddin Banaga, a state minister for housing and
engineering, says the government also is trying to persuade people
along the river to move permanently to higher ground to try to end
``this vicious circle of floods and destruction.''
	   But residents of Tuti Island _ which sits about 100 meters
(yards) off Khartoum _ will not listen to government pleas to
relocate.
	   Zeia al-Abdin al-Burai, an accountant and island resident, said
the islanders resisted British efforts to move elsewhere during
colonial rule in the 1940s.
	   ``We are not leaving our soul and history. ... Seven to 10
generations of grandfathers lived here,'' he said.
	   Sabah el-Khair Abdul Awi, 72 and one of the oldest residents,
said the islanders trace their heritage to four families who
settled on Tuti 700 years ago.
	   Life on the island also has taught Tuti's residents much about
surviving floods.
	   Early Tuesday, when the alarm was sounded from the mosque that
flood waters broke through part of the dike, thousands turned out
to shore up the flood barrier. Now, the residents are keeping watch
and throwing on more sandbags as needed against the rising waters.
	   About 90 of the island's homes in low-lying areas have been
abandoned. Since the island consists of large, extended families,
those driven out have moved in with relatives. Tuti's remaining
3,000 homes still are protected by the dike.
	   Men are working in shorts or with their traditional galabiya
robes hitched above the knees to keep the barrier intact, and women
are outdoors cooking for those doing the sandbagging.
	   ``A single centimeter and all our efforts will be washed away,''
Abdul-Rahim Siraj el-Nour, a banker who lives on the island, said
Wednesday.
	   Dr. Firial Omer, a Tuti resident and a physician at Khartoum
Hospital, said she feared problems with mosquitoes and malaria once
the flooding subsided. But she, too, said Tuti's people would not
leave the island.
	   ``There will be damage,'' she said. ``But if we survive, we will
come out stronger.''

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ African and U.N. leaders, alarmed
by an escalation of fighting in Congo, Thursday made a third
attempt at achieving peace in the embattled country.
	   Leaders from neighboring countries embroiled in Congo's civil
war met for a two-day peace conference in the Ethiopian capital of
Addis Ababa to negotiate an immediate cease-fire and withdrawal of
foreign troops.
	   ``The fact that we are meeting ... attests to the seriousness
with which the issues before us should be tackled,'' Zambian
Defense Minister Chitalu Sampa said in brief remarks before the
press was excluded.
	   Sampa said the negotiators also would try to set up a method for
ensuring all parties, including foreign troops, comply with the
cease-fire. Kabila was on the verge of defeat before Angola,
Namibia and Zimbabwe sent help.
	   But it was unclear how the negotiations could be effective
because the rebels trying to oust Congolese President Laurent
Kabila were excluded. In Goma, eastern Congo, rebel leader Bizima
Karaha said the talks were meaningless, and the rebels would not be
bound by the negotiators' decisions.

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Italy's Infostrada, a joint
telecommunications venture between Olivetti SpA and Germany's
Mannesmann AG, on Thursday launched residential services in the
latest step in ending Italy's telephone land line monopoly.
	   Infostrada, a fixed-line operator, plans to compete with former
monopoly Telecom Italia SpA with rates up to 50 percent cheaper for
international calls and up to 64 percent lower for certain regional
calls, Infostrada executives said.
	   Infostrada can provide international and regional residential
services but cannot offer local service due to regulatory
constraints, the company noted.

Host Malaysia trounces Kenya 4-0

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Shankar Ramu scored two penalty
corner goals Thursday to help host Malaysia score a convincing 4-0
victory over Kenya in a preliminary men's field hockey match of the
Commonwealth Games.
	   The dominance of the hosts was evident from the beginning when
Ramu scored in the fourth minute. He started the corner and took a
return pass from Nor Saiful Zaini Nasiruddin to slam the ball in.
Ramu scored again in the 57th minute.
	   But coach Paul Lissek of Germany blasted Malaysia's inaugural
performance at the games, saying his players made ``simple mistakes
like children. Unbelievable!''
	   Lissek said the Malaysian passing was not too good and they
flubbed chances that were crafted after good moves.
	   ``But that's natural with an inexperienced team. We have very
young players,'' said Lissek who took over in July following
Malaysia's dismal performance during the World Cup in May. It
finished 11 among 12 nations.
	   This was Kenya's second straight loss at the Games. Pakistan
defeated it 5-4 on Wednesday.
	   Malaysia's second goal was scored in the 23rd minute by Charil
Anuar Abdul Aziz, also from a penalty corner.
	   On top of the defeat, Kenya suffered a setback when Kenneth
Kaunda Midundo was struck on the face by a streaking ball shot by
Nor Azlan Bakar during a penalty corner in the 60th minute.
Midundo's face was bloodied and he was taken away on stretcher. His
condition was not immediately known.
	   However, the foul of stopping the ball with the body in the
circle resulted in a penalty stroke, which Kuhan Shanmuganathan
converted easily.
	   In other matches, New Zealand and South Africa drew 3-3 with all
the South African goals scored by Greg Nicol. Two New Zealand goals
were scored by Ryan Archibald and one by Kenneth Robinson.
Meanwhile, Wales defeated Trinidad and Tobago 2-0.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranians stood Friday as the American
national anthem was played here for the first time in 19 years,
when a U.S. wrestler took first place in the World Wrestling
Championships.
	   The audience at the Azadi arena in Tehran erupted into applause
after Sam Henson defeated Namik Abdullavev of Azerbaijan 3-1 to
claim the gold medal.
	   The crowd chanted ``U.S.A.'' as the referee announced Henson's
victory.
	   The more than 12,000 spectators, among them Iranian Vice
President Mustapha Hashemi Taba, stood as a recording of the
Star-Spangled Banner blared from the arena's sound system and the
U.S. flag was raised above the Azeri and Iranian flags.
	   A U.S. wrestling team came here in February competing in a
locally organized competition in the first official visit by
Americans to Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
	   Before Henson left the winners' podium Friday, he raised the arm
of Iran's Gholamreza Mohammadie, who won the bronze.
	   After Henson received his medal, fans threw flowers at him. He
bowed in appreciation and threw some of the flowers back.
	   ``I never imagined Iranians were like this. You are the best
fans in the world. I really respect you,'' Henson told the crowd.
His comments were also broadcast live on Iranian television.
	   The return of the U.S. athletes is important to many Iranians,
who see it as further proof of the potential for improving
relations with the United States, long condemned by militant
Iranians as ``The Great Satan.''

Dow sinks on Wall Street, stocks skid lower in Europe, Asia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will update with Wall Street close. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks tumbled Thursday, extending Wednesday's
losses and threatening to wipe out all of Tuesday's record gain, as
fresh worries about impeachment added to uneasiness over a growing
global economic crisis and its impact on U.S. corporate profits.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, up a record 380.53 points
Tuesday then down 155.76 on Wednesday, was off as much as 260.81 in
the early going Thursday. It was down 218.59 at 7,646.43 by early
afternoon, bringing losses for the past two sessions to 374.35
points.
	   Broader indicators also were lower in heavy trading and shares
were sinking sharply in Latin America.
	   Stocks also skidded lower in Europe, with the major index
finishing down 5.8 percent in Germany, a major trading partner of
beleaguered Russia. Russian President Boris Yeltsin assured German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl by phone Thursday that his new choice for
prime minister would stick to market reforms if confirmed, the
German government said.
	   Shares closed down 3.3 percent in London, Europe's largest
market, and were off 4.6 percent in Paris.
	   On Wall Street, in the rush out of stocks, there was a surge in
the market for U.S. Treasury bonds _ a traditional haven for cash
in times of unrest. Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds, which move in
the opposite direction of prices, fell to 5.21 percent. If that
holds through the day, it would be the lowest since the government
first began regular sales of those securities in 1977.
	   Among the uncertainties confronting traders is how Congress will
respond to the long-awaited report delivered Wednesday by
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr on possible impeachable offenses
by President Bill Clinton. Impeachment proceedings could bog down
government and it is not known how that would affect the economy.
	   In addition, stocks have been hurt by disappointing profit
announcements by companies, many of them related to the economic
mess that has swept through Asia and Russia and is threatening
Latin America.
	   In Sao Paulo, Brazil, trading temporarily stopped at Latin
America's largest exchange after a 10 percent plunge in its main
index after 67 minutes of trading. Shares tumbled even further when
trading resumed amid worries about a devaluation of Brazil's
currency and the selloff on Wall Street.
	   In Tokyo, the Nikkei average of 225 selected issues fell for the
second straight day to end 89.51 points, or 0.6 percent, lower at
14,666.03.
	   In Hong Kong, shares closed marginally lower on listless

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin named a compromise candidate for
prime minister on Thursday, defusing a dangerous power struggle by
naming a man who should win swift approval in the hostile
parliament.
	   Yet his choice, the respected acting Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov, has little economic experience to help him face a nation
impatient for a way out of the morass.
	   The president's decision to put Primakov at the head of a new
government was well received by most opposition politicians and had
a calming effect on a country buffeted by political feuding and
economic collapse.
	   Primakov, a former KGB spy chief, could be confirmed in
parliament as early as Friday. He will need to quickly assemble a
Cabinet to deal with the most severe economic crisis since the
Soviet collapse seven years ago.
	   ``I think he will get (parliament's) support. Common sense has
prevailed in our state,'' said Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov,
who spearheaded the opposition to the previous candidate for
premier, Viktor Chernomyrdin.
	   In Washington, White House press secretary Mike McCurry said
that the U.S. government ``knows and respects'' Primakov. ``We
would expect to have a good and close working relationship.''
	   In Russia's battered markets, the ruble strengthened for a
second day and stocks rose in response to Primakov's nomination.
But bringing Russia out of a wrenching, decade-old economic slump
will be a massive undertaking. The nation is suffering high
inflation, widespread unemployment and industrial stagnation.
	   Yeltsin's compromise was seen by some opposition leaders as a
major defeat for the president. But Yeltsin, who retains full
control of the government, has compromised in the face of strong
opposition in the past. Primakov is a long-time ally of the
president who is not likely to challenge Yeltsin.
	   Primakov, 68, is highly regarded by most Russian political
groups. He has never expressed any political ambitions and is seen
as a technocrat, not ideologically linked to any faction.
	   The low-key, publicity shy Primakov appears more comfortable
handling discrete diplomatic negotiations than enduring the glare
of publicity that his new job will bring.
	   His public comments in recent years have focused almost
exclusively on foreign affairs, ignoring Russian domestic issues.
	   As foreign minister, Primakov won praise at home for his efforts
to restore some of Russia's diminished international clout and
create a ``multipolar'' world designed to counterbalance U.S.
dominance.
	   Primakov is expected to support economic reforms, but he has not
made any public comments about what sort of economic program he
envisions. Based on his work as foreign minister, Primakov may seek
international help in rebuilding Russia's economy.
	   Yet he still considers Russia one of the world's leading powers
and feels it should not become subservient to the West or sacrifice
its independence for the sake of closer relations or economic aid.
	   ``Russia is prepared to contribute its entire foreign policy
potential, in particular its specific geographical position, its
tremendous clout accumulated over the years, its status of a
permanent member of the U.N. Security Council and its impressive
scientific and technological potential to the democratic and
civilized development of the world,'' the Interfax news agency
quoted him as telling a conference of international lawmakers on
Thursday.
	   Primakov has cool but cordial relations with the United States.
There has been periodic friction over his desire to ease sanctions
against Iraq, maintain nuclear cooperation with Iran, and resist
NATO's expansion.
	   Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev picked him as one of his
closest aides during the reform period of the late 1980s.
	   He entered the international spotlight at the end of 1990 when,
shortly before the Gulf War began, he made several high-profile
trips to Iraq and tried unsuccessfully to persuade Saddam Hussein
to withdraw from Kuwait.
	   Primakov was briefly first deputy director of the KGB, the main
Soviet security organization in 1991. After the Soviet breakup, he
served as head of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service until
Yeltsin named him foreign minister in 1996.
	   Yeltsin settled on Primakov after parliament twice rejected
Chernomyrdin, with opposition leaders vowing to vote him down again
on a third and final vote.
	   ``I cannot harm Russia. Russia has had enough upheavals this
century. This is my choice,'' Chernomyrdin said after dropping out
of the race.
	   Chernomyrdin served five years as prime minister before Yeltsin
fired him last March. Many Russians blame him for the country's
economic problems.
	   If parliament were to reject Primakov _ an unlikely scenario _
then the president would be required to dissolve the Duma and call
new elections.
	   In a nationally televised address, Chernomyrdin said
parliament's refusal to confirm him was part of a Communist plot to
force Yeltsin to resign and seize power. ``It's a creeping coup.''
	   He reproached Yeltsin for making concessions, urging him: ``Show
will!'' _ warning that Russia is in danger of being engulfed by
fascism.
	   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, whom many considered a top contender
for the post, said Chernomyrdin's warning was ``an emotional
statement rather than a realistic assessment,'' Interfax reported.
	   ``We will not abandon our path (of reform),'' Luzhkov was quoted
as saying.

Trials of suspected KLA members to start, officials say

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia's chief prosecutor
Thursday claimed victory over Albanian separatists in Kosovo and
announced hundreds of suspected militants would go on trial this
month.
	   Speaking on state-run Radio Belgrade, chief Yugoslav prosecutor
Vukasin Jokanovic said ``Serbian security forces have defeated the
so-called Kosovo Liberation Army, crushed its formations on the
battlefield and arrested a large number of its members.''
	   ``The stage is now set for judiciary bodies... to do their
job... professionally and legally,'' Jokanovic said.
	   Another official, Serbian Justice Minister Dragoljub Jankovic,
told independent FoNet news agency that 716 ethnic Albanians are
currently under investigation by courts in Kosovo and could face
``charges of terrorism and conspiracy against the state.''
	   Of these, 379 have been captured and are being held in the
province's prisons and charges have so far been raised against 93
``terrorists,'' Jankovic said. The rest are on the run, he added.
	   Most of the court proceedings are due to start late September
and early October, Jankovic said.

Spain's Clemente resigns as national soccer coach
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Adds background, speculation on replacement

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Javier Clemente resigned Thursday as
Spain's national soccer coach, paying the price for a disappointing
World Cup and a dismal start in European Championship play.
	   Clemente, 48, told a news conference he was leaving ``because of
the very tense situation that has emerged and because Spanish
soccer takes precedence over my remaining as coach.''
	   After a four-hour meeting with Spanish soccer federation
executives, Clemente announced there was a ``mutual'' agreement to
cancel the remaining two years on his contract.
	   Jose Antonio Camacho, who resigned as Real Madrid's coach in
July after just days on the job, is considered the favorite to
replace Clemente.
	   Clemente served in the post for six years and a day, overseeing
the team in 62 games for a record of 36 wins, 20 ties and six
losses.
	   Under Clemente, Spain qualified for the 1994 World Cup in the
United States and this year's World Cup in France. Spain was one of
the higher rated teams in France but turned in a disappointing
performance, failing to get past the first round.
	   Clemente came home to newspaper headlines screaming for his
head. He kept a low profile, and only recently spoke out on that
debacle, admitting that he had made mistakes but insisting he would
not step down. His players defended him, as did the Spanish
federation.
	   The team's most recent loss _ a humiliating 3-2 defeat last
Saturday to Cyprus in a qualifier for the 2000 European
Championship _ was a huge embarrassment. Cyprus' coach is a police
inspector and the team of part-timers includes electricians and
bank employees.
	   The chorus of calls for Clemente's resignation got louder. Such
was the uproar that even Education and Culture Minister Esperanza
Aguirre said the the Spanish federation had to ``take measures.''

Five killed when Pakistan Air Force plane rams second aircraft
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Two Pakistan Air Force transport
planes caught fire, killing five crewmen and wounding four others,
when the aircraft crashed into each other at an air force base near
the capital of Islamabad on Thursday, a statement issued by the
military said.
	   The two C-130 transport plane collided after the brakes on one
aircraft failed while it was on the ground at the Chaklala Air Base
in Rawalpindi city, about 15 kilometers (10 miles) from Islamabad,
the air force said.
	   ``The plane was returning to the parking area after a routine
ground check, went out of control due to brake failure caused by a
fire on the brake system, and hit another parked C-130 aircraft,''
the statement said.
	   Four of the crewmen died at the scene, and the fifth died later.
One of the four injured was in critical condition, the statement
said. No other details were immediately given.

Greece begins 2004 anti-terrorism preparations

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ With Athens scheduled to host the Olympic
Games in 2004, Greece has already begun preparations to prevent a
possible terrorist attack during the event, public order ministry
officials said Thursday.
	   A Greek police committee is studying the security arrangements
of previous Olympics, and members of the armed forces will also
join the body in five months, Public Order Ministry Secretary
General Yiannis Papadoyiannakis announced.
	   Papadoyiannakis made the statement during a European conference
which opened here Thursday on preventing terrorism during major
sports and cultural events.
	   Police and security officials from all European Union countries
except Luxembourg are attending the two-day meeting. The conference
took place behind closed doors.
	   Greece will not ask for practical assistance from abroad in
policing the Games. ``Security is exclusively and only Greece's
obligation,'' Papadoyiannakis stressed.
	   ``The issue of security is perhaps one of the most important
issues in preparation,'' said Stratis Stratigis, president of the
Athens 2004 organizing committee. ``We live in a secure country,
but we mustn't rule out anything.''
	   Greece is home to November 17, one of the world's most elusive
terrorist groups. It has used bombs, guns and missiles to target
American, Greek and Turkish officials and companies, killing 22
people since its 1975 assassination of the CIA station chief in
Athens.

Few Malaysians show up for cricket tournament
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ When the program for the 1998
Commonwealth Games was being decided, Malaysia insisted that
cricket be included.
	   And King Tuanku Ja'afar turned up to watch matches when the
sport made its games debut this week.
	   But few other Malaysians have shown the same enthusiasm despite
the presence of stars like Sachin Tendulkar, Curtly Ambrose and
Stephen Fleming on the field.
	   At Wednesday's opening match between Australia and Canada, a
father and his two sons, bedecked in the Australian one-day kit,
and an elderly expat cricket lover made up the crowd.
	   Few have recognized cricketing heroes Alvin Kallicharran and
Vivian Richards as they have walked past. Inside the games village,
many athletes have clamored to meet veterans like Australian
skipper Steve Waugh. But beyond the gates of the sports complex he
has been anonymous.
	   The pavilions at some cricket venues are tents that leak in the
rain, there are no drinks trolleys, and press boxes are located
where reporters can barely see the action and do not have scorers,
a routine feature in international championships.
	   ``Even the volunteers appointed to these venues do not
understand the game and so I can't get any work out of them,'' said
an official.
	   Ignorance of cricket among Malaysians is not surprising.
	   Malaysia jettisoned the game of its colonial masters decades
ago. It decided to revive it now to gain sporting prestige and make
these Commonwealth Games, the first in Asia, also the largest ever.
Sixteen cricket teams are competing.
	   To demonstrate its commitment to cricket, the nation quickly
prepared eight venues by upgrading existing club grounds. Fences
were erected, the grass was smoothened and expert groundsmen were
called in to bring the pitches to international standards. Malaysia
also hopes for Test status by 2020.
	   British officers first brought cricket to Malaysia, and the
sport gained popularity among rubber planters and their employees
from Australia, New Zealand, India and Sri Lanka.
	   More than 20 clubs nationwide regularly played each other, and a
unified Malaya team even won against an Australian Test team that
had stopped on the voyage back from an England series in 1926.
	   But at independence, the game lost official patronage because
majority Malays preferred soccer, and cricket was seen as a
preserve of ethnic Indians, who account for 10 percent of the 22
million Malaysians. Ethnic Chinese, the largest minority, also
favored soccer over cricket.
	   ``There are Malays who play cricket but then they lose interest
in the game because the universities no more have cricket teams,''
said Rosmanizam Abdullah, general secretary of the Malay Cricket
Association, one of the handful of clubs that still promote
cricket.
	   But not everyone thought that thin attendance was peculiar to
Malaysia.
	   ``I've seen county games in England where there are just two
dogs and an old lady watching,'' said Alvin Kallicharran, who
coaches the Kenyan team and travels with it.

Oil slick threatens marine life on Emirates' east coast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ An oil slick was threatening
marine life off the coast of the Emirates on Thursday.
	   The slick, which has polluted some 8 kilometers (5 miles) of
seashore in the emirate of Fujairah, was caused by oil tankers
washing out their tanks, the Gulf News quoted fishermen as saying.
	   An official at Fujairah's municipality confirmed that a slick
was threatening marine life, but he said his department had
inadequate resources to deal with the pollution.
	   Earlier this year, a barge ran aground and spilled 4,000 tons
(28,000 barrels) of fuel oil off the northern emirate of Umm Al
Quwain, killing millions of fish larvae and destroying thousands of
mangrove trees.

Havel cleared by doctors to visit the U.S.

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel has been
cleared by his medical team to leave for an official visit to
Washington starting Sep. 15, his personal doctor announced
Thursday.
	   Havel, 61, fought off a life-threatening case of pneumonia in
August and had an emergency surgery for a ruptured colon in
February.
	   A former chain smoker and veteran of communist jails, Havel has
been hospitalized five times since December 1996 when a third of
his lung and a cancerous tumor were removed.
	   ``Mr. Havel underwent a complex medical check which proved his
condition is stabilized,'' Dr. Ilja Kotik said in a statement faxed
to The Associated Press.
	   Havel is scheduled to meet with top U.S. officials including
President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright.
	   Three members of the president's medical team will travel with
him and the schedule foresees three hours of rest every day.

Courier a surprise choice for Davis Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Jim Courier, who skipped the U.S Open because of
an injured arm, was picked Thursday for an unusually weak U.S.
squad that will play Italy in the Davis Cup semifinals.
	   Courier, the world's No. 1 player in 1992 but now 70th, was
among four players chosen by captain Tom Gullikson for the series
in Milwaukee Sept. 25-27.
	   The other selections were Todd Martin, a Davis Cup veteran, and
rookies Justin Gimmelstob and Jan-Michael Gambill. Martin is ranked
27th, the only one of the quartet better than No. 50. The average
ranking is 60th on the American team.
	   ``Rankings don't concern me,'' Gullikson said. ``What concerns
me is to get three points in Milwaukee. In Davis Cup, rankings
don't mean much. I've seen lower-ranked players play inspirational
tennis for their country.''
	   Top-ranked Pete Sampras and No. 8 Andre Agassi said they wanted
no part of the Davis Cup semis, citing reasons ranging from lack of
public response to conflicts with other events.
	   ``Last year in the finals, he (Sampras) was injured and it left
a bad taste in his mouth,'' Gullikson said. ``He's focused on
individual goals. Also, he's a strong proponent of creating an
offseason for himself.''
	   Courier last played in Cincinnati in August, losing to Tommy
Haas in straight sets in the first round. He skipped the next
tournament in New Haven and withdrew from the Open, with an injury
officially listed as a ``dead arm.''
	   ``In the last couple years, his body has broken down and he has
had to back off training, and he's also not playing up to the
standard he has had in his career,'' Gullikson said of Courier.
``But we have seen examples in the Davis Cup _ he has played top 10
tennis.''
	   His Davis Cup record is 15-9, and the United States is 12-0 in
series he has played. He rallied to win in five sets over Marat
Safin of Russia in the quarterfinals in Atlanta to clinch a
semifinal berth.
	   ``The Davis Cup and the Grand Slams are the two reasons I get up
every morning and strap on my shoes and practice,'' Courier said.

UEFA president: Super League would kill soul of football
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Repeating protectively &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos IST101, IST103

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ UEFA president Lennart Johansson warned
Thursday that the proposed breakaway European Super League would
destroy ``the soul of football.''
	   Johansson, visiting Turkey to join in the celebrations marking
the 75th anniversary of the republic, reiterated that UEFA would
never accept a private venture.
	   ``Our matches should be shown all over the world on free
television. I doubt that we will go for a pay-per-view system,''
the semi-official Anatolia news agency quoted Johansson as saying.
``We have to think about the people.''
	   He was also voiced concerns over the morality of the proposed
Super League plan.
	   ``There is a risk that the soul of football...is getting lost
and if something like this should happen we will all suffer,'' he
said. ``People on the streets, the spectators, the fans, the clubs,
all are against a break-up of a few from the football family.''
	   UEFA, European soccer's governing body, has said that plans for
a breakaway super league endanger European soccer's credibility and
discriminate against East Europe.
	   ``Small teams should not be forgotten. We are serving all
Europe,'' Johansson said.
	   A Milan-based marketing firm Media Partners hopes to form a
Super League by 2001 involving the biggest names in European
soccer, including Bayern Munich, Ajax, Inter and AC Milan,
Manchester United and Arsenal.
	   Johansson expressed confidence he will get FIFA's support in
stopping the breakaway league.
	   ``We can't win the game with threats, we are aware of that,''
Johansson said. ``But UEFA and FIFA would not allow some certain
things.''
	   UEFA plans to head off the breakaway by reforming its own club
competitions.
	   Commenting on the dlrs 1 billion takeover bid by Rupert
Murdoch's BSkyB of Manchester United, Johansson repeated his
concerns about commercialization.
	   ``It is when (media companies) interfere in the sporting
criteria that I get worried,'' he said. ``Otherwise I am not here
to criticize Mr. Murdoch. I think he knows what he is doing.''

Shearer, Ferdinand only English in Premier League Hall of Fame
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Alan Shearer and Les Ferdinand were the only
English players among the six stars named Thursday as original
members of the Premier League's Hall of Fame.
	   Manchester United's retired French star Eric Cantona leads the
international quartet, which also comprised his former United
teammate and Danish goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel, Italian striker
Gianfranco Zola of Chelsea and Arsenal's Dutch striker Dennis
Bergkamp.
	   The selection panel, including England's 1966 World Cup
champions Geoff Hurst and Bobby Charlton, picked one player from
each of the six years since the Premier League was created in 1992.
	   Schmeichel and Cantona were picked as the outstanding players in
the league in 1992-93 and 1993-94 respectively, when Manchester
United won back-to-back titles.
	   Shearer was selected for his contribution in 1994-95, Ferdinand
in 1995-96, Zola in 1996-97 and Bergkamp was voted the No. 1 player
in 1997-98, when Arsenal won the FA Cup and League double.
	   Ferdinand said it was a great honor to be part of such an elite
group.
	   ``And to be picked from a league which boasts some of the most
famous players in the world, is a really great feeling,'' he said.
	   The Hall of Fame opens in March. The six players selected by the
panel as inaugural members will be joined by six players selected
by the public via a telephone poll.
	   Runners-up in the panel vote included Tottenham's German striker
Juergen Klinsmann, Arsenal captain Tony Adams, Liverpool's
18-year-old striker Michael Owen, Manchester United midfielder

Govt report confirms widespread corruption, backs hard line
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A new report detailing widespread corruption in
Corsica says the French government should toughen efforts to clean
up the island's administration, the head of the study said
Thursday.
	   Behind lawmaker Jean Glavany's comments were calls to keep
Corsica part of France despite grumbling on the mainland that the
Mediterranean island, with a violent nationalist movement, is a
fiscal black hole and should be cut loose.
	   Glavany called for an intensification of a crackdown on
corruption and lawlessness after the February assassination of the
highest Paris-appointed official on the island, Prefect Claude
Erignac.
	   At a news conference unveiling the report, Glavany called on
Corsicans, who have marched against nationalist violence, to ``pass
from cries to acts.''
	   French officials have complained of a lack of local cooperation
in tracking down suspects, either due to solidarity or fear of
reprisals on the sparsely populated island where anonymity is hard
to maintain.
	   But Glavany also urged people in France to understand that the
island should remain part of their country.
	   Some French political leaders have urged a referendum on whether
to keep Napoleon's birthplace in France or to grant it
independence, and polls have indicated some support for that.
	   The report, submitted to Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin,
was the first of its kind on Corsica.
	   It was a searing testimony of what it called a ``pre-mafia-like
system'' on the island. The report portrayed a costly, bloated and
ineffective island government.
	   Corsica has the nation's highest number of bureaucrats per 1,000
inhabitants _ 39 _ and is paralyzed by waste, inefficient
management, or fear of violent local groups, the report said.
	   The island has been struck by more than 8,700 bombings since
1973, ``nearly one per day,'' the report said.
	   ``The application of republican law constantly runs up against
intimidation, collusion or pure violence,'' the report said.
	   Criticizing wasted agricultural supports, the report calls on
officials to reexamine the system.
	   It urges officials rethinking the recruiting practice of civil
servants.
	   In a gesture to nationalists, the report also backs ``the
dissemination of the Corsican language and culture.''
	   On Monday, Jospin is to comment on the report when he is visited
by the new Corsican prefect, Bernard Bonnet, and Bernard Legras,
the prosecutor general on the island's northern port of Bastia.

New research shows how HIV suddenly erupts, increases cell death
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Molecular biologists may have discovered how AIDS
suddenly can erupt into a catastrophic illness after lurking for
years as a low-grade infection.
	   New research by a nationwide team of scientists suggests that
the human immunodeficiency virus eventually attacks a class of
disease-fighting cells produced by the immune system that were
thought to be impervious to attack by the virus.
	   The results, which have been limited so far to test-tube
experiments, could provide drug makers with a new target for drugs
designed to keep the virus in check, as well as vaccines aimed at
preventing infection.
	   Researchers said the attack on this different group of immune
cells, known as CD8 T cells, triggers an explosion of cell death
that exhausts the immune system and leaves the body vulnerable to
pneumonia and other secondary infections that typically kill most
AIDS patients.
	   The new study was published in the latest issue of the journal
Nature.
	   Exactly how AIDS affects the CD8 cells remains unclear, though.
	   Researchers said one possibility is that the virus reduces the
immune system's ``social control'' over its own powerful cells. The
disruption to this precise chemical balance triggers a potentially
fatal domino effect that not only leaves the body vulnerable to
infection, but also may contribute to the loss of brain cells that
causes AIDS-related dementia and other debilitating side effects.
	   ``Because CD8 T cells are professional killers, they may do
serious harm if they end up in the wrong place,'' said French AIDS
researcher Jean Claude Ameisen of the Hospital Bichat in Paris.
	   For several years, scientists have known that HIV readily
infects one type of immune cell known as the CD4, or helper T cell,
by locking onto a protein on its surface and breaching its cell
wall.
	   The CD8 cells were thought to have better protection. Yet in the
latter stages of AIDS, CD8 cells start dwindling rapidly, too.
	   Researchers said their experiments show that a strain of HIV
that usually evolves late in the course of infection latches onto a
particular surface protein of the CD8 cell known as CXCR4.
	   But unlike in CD4 cells, the virus does not actually take over
its cellular machinery.
	   Instead, they report, when the virus latches onto the CXCR4
protein the CD8 cell sees the change as a kind of a death signal
and commits suicide.
	   The cell death process is complex, and quickly involves an array
of other cell types that soon may subvert the entire immune system
and lead to full-blown AIDS symptoms, said lead author Georges
Herbein of the Picower Institute for Medical Research in Manhasset,
N.Y.
	   ``Because CD8 cells are thought to limit the spread of the
infection, the failure of CD8 function could contribute to the
development of AIDS,'' he said.

German state offers cut-rate taxi fares for club-hoppers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SCHWERIN, Germany (AP) _ An eastern German state and private
sponsors are trying to deter drunken driving by offering half-rate
taxi fares for young people heading to and from dance clubs.
	   The offer in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, which has three
times the national average for alcohol-related traffic accidents,
is good from Sept. 15 through the end of next year, state officials
said Thursday.
	   The state, the Esso oil company and a car-rental and taxi
industry group will compensate taxi drivers for their lost revenue.
	   Though the initiative is aimed at ``young people,'' it
stipulates no specific age; cab riders simply must be on their way
to or from a disco.

Scary Spice to tie the knot, newspapers say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Scary Spice is ready to make it legal.
	   Pregnant Spice Girl Melanie Brown, 23, will wed dancer Jimmy
Gulzar on Sunday and throw a lavish reception on the grounds of her
sprawling estate west of London, several British newspapers
reported Thursday.
	   Brown announced recently that she was pregnant with Gulzar's
child.
	   The two reportedly will marry in tiny St. John the Baptist
Church in the Buckinghamshire village of Little Marlow, a stone's
throw from her eight-bedroom mansion, known locally as The Manor.
	   Workers scurried around the grounds Thursday making preparations
that included a two-tier marquee tent and covered walkways to
protect guests from the prying lenses of paparazzi.
	   The newspapers said that among the 100 or so guests _ all of
whom have been asked to wear white _ will be Spice mates Melanie
Chisholm, Emma Bunton and Victoria Adams, the latter of whom also
is expecting a child.
	   No word yet on whether Geri Halliwell, who parted company with
the group in June, will turn up.

World Food Program sends first emergency food to Kinshasa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The World Food Program sent its first
shipments of food to Congo's capital on Thursday, a statement said,
reaching out to needy Congolese as fighting in the war-ravaged
country continues,
	   A C-130 Hercules cargo plane on loan from Belgium delivered 20
tons of maize to Kinshasa from Pointe-Noire, in neighboring
Republic of Congo, some 400 kilometers (250 miles) west of
Kinshasa.
	   ``Once security measures and distribution logistics in Kinshasa
are put in place with local authorities and other humanitarian
partners, WFP will begin its emergency food distribution,'' WFP
said in a release.
	   The U.N. agency is targeting 120,000 of the most vulnerable in
Kinshasa, including children, pregnant women or those who have just
given birth, and hospital patients.
	   The WFP has 700 metric tons of food stored in warehouses across
the river in Brazzaville, capital of the Republic of Congo, enough
to feed 100,000 people for two weeks.
	   The WFP plans to use the C-130 for another 15 airlifts over the
next week, as well as bring in food by barge from Brazzaville.

Spanish stocks plunge on fears of crisis spreading to Latin America
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spanish stock prices plummeted Thursday on
fears that Latin America will be the next region hit by a financial
crisis.
	   The IBEX-35 index of Spain's most liquid shares closed down
600.90 points at 7904.00, a fall of 7.1 percent. That was just
short of its largest-ever one-day fall of 8.5 percent, on Aug. 19,
1991.
	   One Madrid-based trader said foreign investors and possibly
hedge funds have been attacking Spanish stocks which are exposed to
Latin America, while domestic investors have been switching to
bonds.
	   About 123.60 million shares changed hands, compared with 70.67
million the previous session.
	   Bond prices closed sharply higher. At 1416 GMT, the benchmark
five-year 5.25 percent bond was at 105.79 to yield 3.77 percent, up
sharply from 105.24 to yield 3.92 percent late Wednesday.

Cardin presents model of planned tribute to Alexandria lighthouse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ French fashion designer Pierre Cardin on
Thursday unveiled a scale model of a fluorescent obelisk which he
aims to build in Alexandria as a millennium tribute to the Egyptian
city's famed lighthouse _ the lost seventh wonder of the world.
	   Cardin, who is a UNESCO peace ambassador, presented the working
model, which features glittering multicolored lights and laser
beams, at the Lisbon world's fair.
	   ``It represents light, peace, and it rises towards the sky, so
it has hope _ and this is what we want to see in the year 2000
throughout the world,'' Cardin said.
	   The concrete-and-glass monument, planned to be 145 metres (160
yards) tall, is to stand on the tip of a jetty overlooking the Bay
of Alexandria, only a few metres from where the original lighthouse
stood before it was destroyed by an earthquake in 1349.
	   Egyptian officials granted approval for the dlrs 86 million
obelisk last month, though the project is still short of financing.
	   Some 16,500 computer-controlled lights inside the column are to
illuminate the obelisk, while powerful lasers cast beams out to sea
and back onto Alexandria's historical monuments.
	   It will be decorated with Egyptian hieroglyphics, and Greek,
Latin and Arabic letters.
	   ``It's a tribute to Egyptian, Greek and Mediterranean
civilization,'' Cardin said.
	   The obelisk was designed by Jacques Darolles, a French lighting
engineer and director of France's National Centre for Art and
Technology.

F-1 drivers make peace following Monza meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONZA, Italy (AP) _ Forget Spa-Francorchamps.
	   Michael Schumacher and David Coulthard, who nearly came to blows
following a collision in the Belgian GP last month, shook hands and
made peace Thursday in Monza.
	   Following a 70-minute meeting, in the ``neutral'' motorhome of
the Williams team, Schumacher said he saw ``no point to be in anger
with David ... after talks it was pretty clear he did not do it on
purpose. Initially it was not so clear.''
	   He mumbled a yes when he was asked whether the case had been
resolved amicably.
	   Schumacher, a two-time world F-1 champion driving with Ferrari,
had accused Coulthard of reckless driving after they collided in
pouring rain and near-zero visibility during the Belgian race at
Spa-Francorchamps on Aug. 30.
	   The German driver, who was leading, slammed into the back of
Coulthard's lapped McLaren-Mercedes, losing his front wheel and any
chance of victory and of championship leadership.
	   Later, Schumacher had to be restrained by team officials as he
tried to reach the McLaren pit and challenge Coulthard.
	   Schumacher said in Monza that he never intended ``to hit anyone
or hurt anyone. I just wanted to express in words my bitter
disappointment ... for losing victory and ten points.''
	   With three races left Schumacher trails Mika Hakkinen,
Coulthard's McLaren teammate, by seven points - 70 to 77 - in the
championship standings.
	   Both Coulthard and Schumacher said there was no apology by
either side during their outspoken discussion on the eve of the
Italian GP.
	   ``We tried to clarify things, so that it cannot happen again,''
Schumacher said.
	   The highest Formula One officials, Max Mosley and Bernie
Ecclestone, had been urging a pacification meeting between the two
drivers to put an end to a growing controversy which was putting at
risk relations between the Ferrari and McLaren teams.
	   ``It was an important meeting, because drivers must challenge
each other only on the circuit,'' said Norbert Haug, general
manager of Mercedes, McLaren's engine and technology supplier.
	   Coulthard, whose four Grand Prix wins compare with Schumacher's
32, said his conscience was clear and that he did not feel
responsible for the accident.
	   ``The meeting was useful to explain our positions,'' said
Coulthard. ``I had nothing to apologize'' about.
	   Schumacher said he was looking forward to Sunday's race to
forget the controversy and concentrate on his remaining chances to
win the drivers title.
	   ``I must win the race to make up for the seven-point difference.
It's a difficult job here because it's not the best circuit for
Ferrari,'' Schumacher said. ``McLaren still has an edge on quick
tracks.''
	   Hakkinen, with six wins this season, is shooting for his first
world title.
	   Coulthard, who had a single win at Imola this year, won the
Monza race last year ahead of Jean Alesi.
	   Free practice for the Italian race begins at 0900gmt Friday with
the qualifying hour at 1100gmt Saturday.

Afghanistan's Taliban says nine missing Iranian diplomats are dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Nine of 11 Iranian diplomats missing
in Afghanistan for a month are dead, the ruling Taliban religious
militia confirmed Thursday, but denied its fighters were involved
in their deaths.
	   Maulvi Saeed-ur-Rehman, the Taliban ambassador to Pakistan, said
Taliban's top spokesman announced that the bodies of nine Iranians
diplomats have been found. They vanished Aug. 8, when the Taliban
militia seized the northern Afghanistan city of Mazar-e-Sharif from
rival forces.
	   Rehman quoted Maulvi Wakil Ahmed, a spokesman of Mulla Omer, as
saying a Taliban commission assigned to locate the missing Iranians
had found the bodies of nine diplomats Wednesday.
	   ``They are dead and the report has been submitted to (Taliban's
leader) Mullah Omer,'' he quoting Ahmed as saying. He said Ahmed
blamed the killing on opponents determined to provoke hostile
relations between Iran and the Taliban.
	   Tensions between Iran and the Taliban, who control 90 percent of
Afghanistan, have increased in recent weeks as Tehran demanded the
return of its diplomats. Last week, Iran conducted a massive
exercise, with 70,000 troops, warplanes and tanks, on the Afghan
border. U.S. and other experts feared the maneuvers could be a
prelude to a military retaliation.
	   Last week, the Taliban returned five of at least 50 Iranian
captives in Afghanistan in a goodwill gesture that Iran said was
not good enough. The Taliban has promised a full report on the fate
of the diplomats, and on Thursday vowed to find and arrest those
who killed them.
	   Shiite Muslim Iran has said it holds Sunni Muslim-dominated
Afghanistan and the Taliban responsible for the diplomats' fate.
	   Rehman said the Taliban had offered to return the diplomats'
remains to Iran, which is seeking an apology and the immediate
release of all Iranian prisoners.
	   But he would not say whether the Taliban would apologize for the
incident, although the BBC television network, citing a
high-ranking Taliban source, on Thursday reported that the group
would not apologize.
	   Ahmed said the incident took place without the Taliban's
knowledge, according to the ambassador.
	   The Taliban blames Iran for backing the opposition northern
alliance which includes the minority Tajik, Uzbek and Hazara ethnic
groups, and Shiite Muslims. Iran denies the allegation. The
Taliban, believed to be backed by Pakistan, are mostly Pushtuns and
follow a strict Sunni version of Islam.

Pakistani court sentences first Muslim to death for blasphemy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHANPUR, Pakistan (AP) _ A Pakistani court has for the first
time sentenced a Muslim to death for blasphemy under a
controversial law that last year caused a Christian bishop to
commit suicide in protest and has drawn heated opposition from
human rights activists.
	   A lower court in the eastern Punjab town of Khanpur, some 420
kilometers (260 miles) south of the provincial capital of Lahore,
sentenced Ghulam Akbar Khan, a laborer, to death for taking the
name of Islam's profit Mohammed in vain, court officials said
Thursday.
	   Khan, a member of Pakistan's Shiite Muslim minority, was accused
of committing blasphemy during a scuffle with a rival Sunni Muslim
at a restaurant in May 1995. Khan has the right to appeal to a
higher court.
	   The blasphemy law was introduced in 1985 under the regime of
military dictator General Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq. It allows the death
penalty for anyone who profanes Mohammed or the religion of Islam.
	   Dozens of people belonging to Pakistan's minority religions,
including Christians, have been sentenced to death, but none have
so far been executed. They have were either acquitted by higher
courts, or fled the country while free on bail. However, there have
been reports of convicted blasphemers being murdered by Muslim
extremists.
	   Last year, Roman Catholic Bishop John Joseph, 65, killed himself
to protest the blasphemy death sentence imposed on a fellow
Pakistani Christian. His death sparked widespread protests by
Christians, who number 2 million in this nation of 130 million
people.
	   The Independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan and a number
of political parties and other groups denounce the blasphemy law,
calling it a tool used to persecute minorities. Shiite Muslims
represent about 15 percent, and other religions 2 percent, of the
population in Sunni Muslim dominated Pakistan.

Unions question government guarantee of loan for luxury hotel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICHARD SIMON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ The Grenada Trade Union Council
accused the government of trying to ``secretly and quickly'' push a
measure through Parliament to guarantee a dlrs 7 million U.S. loan
to build a hotel.
	   The plans to build a dlrs 67 million U.S. Ritz Carlton Hotel and
golf course have been touted for three years by the government as a
future contributor to the island's economy, but they have also been
criticized by environmentalists and farmers who do not want to give
up prime agricultural land.
	   Chester Humphrey, acting president of the union council, said
taxpayers do not know enough about the developers of the hotel
project to guarantee a dlrs 7 million U.S. loan.
	   ``The fact is that no one knows who these people are,'' said
Humphrey. ``No one knows the relationship between the Mt. Hartman
Development Corporation and the Ritz Carlton Hotel.''
	   The local representative of the developer declined to offer any
more information about the company.
	   ``I cannot give you any information now about the Mt. Hartman
Development Corporation. Maybe we might by able to tell you more in
about a week or two,'' company official Nigel Renwick said Tuesday.
	   Foreign Minister Raphael Fletcher also commented on the project:
``My concern concern about that kind of activity is that it stands
scrutiny. That is my concern.''
	   After Fletcher made that statment, the office of Prime Minister
Keith Mitchell issued a statement accusing the press of insinuating
that Fletcher did not support the hotel project.
	   Humphrey of the union council also accused Mitchell's government
of trying to move the loan guarantee through Parliament quickly and
with little scrutiny.
	   The measure was approved in the House of Representatives
although it did not appear on the official agenda, Humphrey noted.

U.S. special Cyprus envoy meets with Greek foreign minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ United States special envoy for Cyprus
Thomas Miller on Thursday discussed deadlocked talks to reunify the
war-divided island with Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos.
	   Although neither official made any statements after the meeting,
Miller said shortly before his talks that they would focus on
securing a bi-zonal federal state for the two separate communities.
	   Miller has tried to rekindle a U.S.-led initiative which fell
apart last May when Turkish Cypriots rebuffed U.S. presidential
envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   At the time, they insisted on international recognition for
their northern breakaway state and a cancellation of European
Union's membership talks with Cyprus.
	   The deadlock grew worse last month after Turkish Cypriots
proposed that Cyprus become a confederation, which would
necessitate recognition of their breakaway state.
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south
and a Turkish-occupied north since a 1974 Turkish invasion
following an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece. The
breakaway state is recognized only by Turkey, which maintains
35,000 troops there.
	   The United States is anxious to restart UN-sponsored peace talks
that have been stalled since August and to persuade Cyprus to
cancel the planned deployment of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft
missiles in November.
	   Ankara has threatened to use force to prevent the deployment, a
move which Athens says will lead to a war between Greece and
Turkey.

Resistant bacteria becoming a global health threat, conference
</HEADLINE>
says &QL; 
 &UR; By JAN M. OLSEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Bacteria resistant to antibiotics
have become a major global problem and will lead to increased
death, illness and health care costs, European health officials
said Thursday.
	   ``In the long term, the frightening prospect is that there will
be no efficient antibiotics against a great number of potentially
lethal diseases,'' Danish Health Minister Carsten Koch said at a
two-day conference of European health officials.
	   The conference comes just days after Danish officials reported a
62-year-old woman died from an antibiotic-resistant strain of
salmonella, called DT104. It was the first fatality in Denmark
known to have been caused by the bacteria, which has been rampant
in Britain for a decade and is known to have caused at least one
death in the United States.
	   ``Bacteria are found everywhere and know no boundaries,'' Koch
said, adding that international cooperation was needed to tackle
the problem.
	   The conference recommended that doctors, veterinarians, farmers
and consumers reconsider their use of antibiotics, which should
only be sold by prescription.
	   ``We must change people's attitude to antibiotics. A pill is not
appropriated for all illness or infections,'' said Jeremy Metters
of the British Department of Health, at the end of the conference
in a northern Copenhagen suburb.
	   Participants said using anti-microbials to promote growth in
farm animals ``was not justified'' and called upon replacing with
safe alternatives, including better agricultural practices.
	   Treatment of bacteria resistant to several types of bacteria
increases medical costs by a factor of 25, said Hans Joern Komos of
a Copenhagen university hospital's microbiological department.
	   The conference also was attended by the World Health
Organization, the European Union, consumer organizations,
university experts and representative of the animal food industry.

Refugees jam squalid Kosovo camp fearing Serb police violence

<TEXT>
	   ISTINIC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Their tractors parked
bumper-to-bumper, an estimated 25,000 refugees _ lacking food,
clean water and hope _ camped Thursday in fields, terrified Serb
police would soon arrest men suspected of membership in the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   Serb forces appeared Thursday to have halted their advance,
which drove ethnic Albanians from their homes and farms into a huge
encampment around this village about 75 kilometers (46 miles)
southwest of Pristina.
	   Carloads of armed Serb police drove menacingly down the road
past the makeshift encampment. For more than a mile (2 kilometers)
from the center of the village, tractors were parked
bumper-to-bumper, hooked to trailers on which the refugees piled
clothing and belongings which they hurriedly loaded from their
abandoned homes.
	   On the horizon, black smoke rose slowly from Albanian villages
abandoned since the Serbs launched a pincer attack Tuesday.
Hundreds of police and soldiers, backed by armored vehicles and
trucks hauling heavy artillery, patrolled nearby.
	   Carloads of armed police, some escorting Western diplomatic
observers, cruised repeatedly down the road as civilians cursed
them. ``Police beat six young guys right here an hour ago with
sticks,'' said one middle-aged man standing on a dirt road through
the camp.
	   Until this week's attacks, the Istinic area was one of the last
strongholds of the KLA, which is fighting for independence from
Serbia, the main part of Yugoslavia.
	   Rrok Berisha, a member of Kosovo's unauthorized ethnic Albanian
parliament, said most of the refugees fled 40 nearby villages
shelled by police in the past few days.
	   Berisha, who has been trapped here for three days, said he
feared 100,000 refugees could stream into the area as more villages
are cleared. Kosovo's population is 90 percent ethnic Albanian,
most of whom back the rebels' armed struggle for independence.
	   Refugees said they feared police would soon begin rounding up
men of fighting age on suspicion they had fought with the KLA. A
village elder said about 40 men and women injured by shelling fled
to hills Wednesday, fearing arrest.
	   Those who stayed behind faced a desperate situation. In one
house, a 16-year-old boy lay on the floor with a bag taped to his
bullet-shattered abdomen to collect excrement.
	   As the boy screamed in pain, family members said he was shot
when he tried to return home with a friend to feed their cattle.
His mother said the boys stumbled upon police looting their home.
Police opened fire, wounding her son and probably killing his
18-year-old friend, the mother said.
	   Outside in the fields, a young women ran screaming for medical
aid, of which there was none. She was carrying an infant, blood
streaming from his head. She said the baby was kicked by a horse in
the jammed refugee convoy.
	   A village official said five people, including a baby and a
toddler, died Wednesday alone for lack of medical treatment.
Refugees and village officials said there was not enough clean
water and food to prevent death and disease.
	   A half-dozen shots rang out Thursday afternoon. A policeman, who
did not give his name, explained his colleagues were simply
shooting cows to roast for their dinner.
	   Kosovo fighting already has created an estimated 265,000
refugees. Western officials fear the worst if urgent help isn't
provided for the 50,000 or so refugees living in the hills and
forests, especially with the arrival of winter in about six weeks.
	   President Clinton released dlrs 20 million in aid for Kosovo
refugees Wednesday. The White House said the money, added to an
earlier U.S. contribution of dlrs 11 million, will go to U.N. and
private agencies providing food and shelter for refugees.
	   In The Hague, Netherlands, John Shattuck, the U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State for Human Rights, warned again Thursday that
Kosovo is headed for a humanitarian catastrophe as the harsh Balkan
winter approaches.
	   ``Massive human rights violations are occurring,'' he said.
``Punitive actions are being taken against large numbers of
civilians. Homes have been destroyed by shelling.''
	   The United Nations estimated this week that 600 to 700 civilians
have been killed in six months of fighting between Serb-led forces
and Kosovo Albanian rebels.
	   While world leaders have condemned Serbian actions, the Serbs
also accuse the militants of massacring Serb civilians.
	   Western officials have threatened military intervention for
months if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic doesn't halt the
offensive. But such plans have been stymied, in large part because
of opposition from Russia and its new prime minister-designate,
Yevgeny Primakov.
	   As foreign minister, Primakov refused to support any U.N.
Security Council resolution to authorize use of force in Kosovo.
Without U.N. approval, many European NATO members are reluctant to
take part.
	   NATO's southern European commander, Adm. T. Joseph Lopez, said
Wednesday that the alliance would need about 50,000 troops to
monitor a possible peace agreement or cease-fire in Kosovo.

U.S. naval commander, Georgia's Shevardnadze pledge cooperation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze
thanked an American naval commander on Thursday for U.S. aid in
developing the former Soviet republic's naval staff and
infrastructure, the president's spokesman said.
	   Shevardnadze met with Vice Admiral Daniel Murphy in the capital
Tbilisi on the eve of the USS LaSalle's departure from Georgia's
Black Sea port of Poti. The vessel, the flagship of the U.S. 6th
Fleet, arrived in the Caucasus nation on Tuesday after docking in
ports in Bulgaria, Romania and Ukraine. It is scheduled to sail on
to Russia and Turkey.
	   The ship, which carries 658 sailors, brought medical supplies
and medical books, warm clothes and children's toys as part of a
humanitarian shipment to Georgia.
	   Earlier this year, the United States provided two patrol boats
for Georgia's Coast Guard. The two nations also signed an agreement
providing for U.S. assistance and training Georgia's border guards.
And U.S. and Georgian troops have taken part in joint exercises
under NATO's Partnership for Peace program.
	   Shevardnadze and Murphy pledged continued cooperation between
their countries, said presidential spokesman Vakhtang Abashidze.
	   Noting that it was the first visit by a U.S. ship, Murphy said
that the USS LaSalle's presence was proof that the Black Sea had
become of bridge of international cooperation.

Adams, Trimble break the ice after three frosty years

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Setting aside profound
suspicions, Protestant leader David Trimble talked in depth for the
first time Thursday with Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams about the proposed
Northern Ireland government.
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Setting aside profound
suspicions, Protestant leader David Trimble talked in depth for the
first time Thursday with Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams about the proposed
Northern Ireland government.
	   ``We are now dealing with the crisis in the way it should be
dealt with _ by direct dialogue,'' Adams said after meeting for 45
minutes alone with Trimble, who was elected ``first minister'' of
the embryonic government in July.
	   Trimble had refused to talk directly with Adams' IRA-allied
party since his 1995 election as leader of the Ulster Unionists,
the major representative of Northern Ireland's British Protestant
majority.
	   He and Adams sat at the same negotiating table for eight months
with Trimble insistent upon talking about Sinn Fein only through
the peace talks' chairman, former U.S. George Mitchell.
	   But Trimble talked briefly with Adams on Monday during a
conference of all political leaders who support April's multi-party
accord on how Protestants and Catholics should jointly govern
Northern Ireland.
	   And both leaders came away from their more personal encounter
Thursday in Stormont Parliamentary Building sounding hopeful that
their fundamental differences could be narrowed.
	   Adams expects his party to hold two positions in a possible
12-member administration, which is being drawn from a much larger
legislative Assembly elected in June.
	   So far, the Assembly has approved only Trimble in the top post
and moderate Catholic politician Seamus Mallon as his deputy. The
108-member Assembly is scheduled to reconvene next week to debate
which parties should hold what posts, and how many should be
created.
	   The accord specifies that the Irish Republican Army should
disarm under international supervision by mid-2000.
	   Trimble insisted Thursday that most Protestant members of the
Assembly would veto Sinn Fein's right to hold top posts if the IRA
refused to start disarming.
	   Considering their long track record of verbally sparring through
the media, however, Thursday's post-meeting comments by Trimble and
Adams appeared surprisingly conciliatory.
	   ``He's a man who I can do business with. He's a man I have do
business with,'' Adams said.
	   ``I put it to Mr. Trimble that he and I had been cast in these
positions and we had to narrow the gap. We had to find ways for him
to help me and me to help him,'' he said.
	   Trimble said he wasn't seeking to publicly shame the IRA-Sinn
Fein movement by demanding disarmament, but that eliminating
``private armies'' was an ``inevitable consequence'' of April's
agreement.
	   ``We are not saying to people that you have to surrender arms or
in any way feel humiliated,'' Trimble said, adding that he was
``quite satisfied'' that Adams understood the difference between
that and internationally supervised disarmament.
	   In an important concrete pledge, Trimble said he expected
Northern Ireland's new administration to meet formally with the
Irish government by early October.
	   Formal policy coordination between Northern Ireland and the
Irish Republic was an essential part of the agreement for
Catholics, moderates and militants alike, who seek Ireland's
eventual unification.
	   Also Thursday, Northern Ireland's police commander announced
that his forces would no longer require backup from British
soldiers in Belfast, although the army would remain active in the
most hard-line Catholic parts of rural Northern Ireland.
	   Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan said his announcement would
eventually affect troop strengths in Northern Ireland, which
currently stand at about 17,000. Soldiers in Belfast now will be
expected largely to remain inside barracks, a step towards what
Sinn Fein calls its goal of ``demilitarization.''

Pesticides and chemicals are target of new treaty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in last graf with spokeman saying treaty would apply
to companies' foreign subsidiaries. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Aiming to protect people and the
environment in developing countries, representatives from 80
nations prepared Thursday to sign a new treaty tightening rules on
pesticides and other hazardous chemicals.
	   The international treaty, sponsored by the U.N. Environment
Program and the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, requires
companies to get official government permission before exporting
such material.
	   Those expected to sign the treaty Friday include the United
States, Britain, Germany, Japan, Canada, Australia and Switzerland
_ all major exporters.
	   If a country signs the agreement, chemical companies based there
will have to provide information on the health and environmental
risks of 22 pesticides and five industrial chemicals, including the
pesticide DDT.
	   Currently, there are about 70,000 chemicals on the market. The
treaty is intended to protect developing nations who cannot control
all of the chemicals entering their borders.
	   Many pesticides that are banned or restricted in industrialized
countries, such as DDT, are still being marketed to developing
nations, said Ennelie Kohl of the Dutch environment ministry.
	   ``This treaty is very important, especially for developing
countries,'' Kohl said.
	   The Swiss-based World Wildlife Fund applauded the agreement,
saying it will protect both the environment and the people _ the
farmers, workers and consumers _ in developing countries.
	   ``It's good to see that governments are committed to making
trade in hazardous chemicals a more transparent, informed,
consensual process,'' said Clifton Curtis, toxic campaigns director
for the WWF.
	   But the group warned that the treaty will not work in developing
countries that produce their own hazardous chemicals or lack
effective regulations.
	   The WWF also urged governments to make a global commitment to
phasing out and eliminating the most hazardous chemicals and
pesticides.
	   Developing countries made a strong showing at the treaty
conference that began Thursday. All African countries were
represented, Kohl said, and almost all of them sent ministers to
sign the agreement on Friday.
	   After the representatives sign the treaty, a minimum of 50
countries must then ratify it before it can take effect. This is
expected to take about two years.
	   Erwin Northoff, a spokesman at the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO), said the rules would probably also apply to the
foreign subsidiaries of companies based in countries that sign the
treaty.

	   BERLIN (AP) _ Calling his work ``a monument against oblivion,''
German President Roman Herzog on Thursday awarded American
filmmaker Steven Spielberg one of Germany's highest awards.
	   In presenting the Knight Commander's Cross of the Order of
Merit, Herzog especially praised Spielberg's film ``Schindler's
List,'' the story of a non-Jewish industrialist who saved the lives
of thousands of Jews during World War II.
	   ``No other movie has been watched or discussed by as many school
classes in Germany,'' Herzog said in a prepared copy of his speech.
``That is why we Germans are especially grateful to you for this
film. It is a monument against oblivion.''
	   Some 500 people, among them U.S. Ambassador to Germany John
Kornblum, Israeli Ambassador Avi Primor, and other dignitaries
showed up for the black-tie ceremony and reception at Bellevue
Castle, Herzog's residence in the capital.
	   Visibly moved by the award, Spielberg pressed his hand to his
heart.
	   ``This is just simply one of the greatest honors I've ever
received in my life. If I knew a moment like this would come into
my life before I made Schindler's List, I might have been too
intimidated to make it,'' he said.
	   Earlier, Spielberg visited a Berlin school where he stressed to
about 100 high school students the importance of passing lessons of
history on to new generations by presenting a new computer CD-ROM
with testimony from Holocaust survivors.
	   ``I consider all these people not only to be victims of the
Holocaust, but also teachers,'' Spielberg said of the four
Holocaust survivors whose stories are included on the CD-ROM.
	   The CD-ROM, narrated by Winona Ryder and Leonardo DiCaprio, was
created by Spielberg's Shoah Visual History Foundation, an archive
of filmed interviews with Holocaust survivors. The project has
gathered nearly 50,000 interviews in four years.
	   ``It's a race against time to get as many victims on tape as
possible,'' Spielberg told the students, whose school will receive
100 copies of the CD-ROM next month.
	   Later Spielberg he said deeply impressed by reception at the
school.
	   ``We introduced our CD Rom for the first time ever. We chose
Berlin to introduce it. And these third-generation German young
people made me so proud of them because they already understand the
lessons of respect and tolerance,'' he said.
	   The English-language CD-ROM, called ``Survivors: Testimonies of
the Holocaust,'' has been made available to U.S. schools for the
fall semester. The interactive program weaves together archival
footage with personal testimonies and photographs.
	   The CD-ROM will be available in Europe in October.

American satellites destroyed in Russian launch

details in graf 14, CLARIFIES in graf 1 that satellites partially
burned up. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A rocket launched by Russia to put 12 U.S.
commercial satellites into orbit failed minutes after blast-off on
Thursday and partially burned up in the atmosphere along with its
cargo.
	   The Ukrainian-made Zenit-2 booster was launched shortly after
midnight by Russian space forces from the Baikonur cosmodrome,
which Moscow rents from the former Soviet republic of Kazakstan.
	   In the fifth minute of flight, the rocket's control system
failed, shutting down the engines.
	   Fragments of the rocket and the Globalstar satellites, built by
the Space Systems Loral company, fell in a sparsely populated area
in southern Siberia, the Russian Space Agency said in a statement
carried by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The Russian Space Agency blamed the Ukrainian manufacturer of
the rocket, the state-owned design and production center Yuzhnoye,
for the failed launch, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   ``The launching was considered Ukraine's responsibility; the
Russian side exercised only general coordination of the work under
the project,'' agency spokesman Vyacheslav Mikhailichenko said.
	   The contract's value wasn't announced, but a usual price for
such launches stands at around dlrs 30 million, the report said.
	   The Yuzhnoye press office partially acknowledged responsibility
later in the day, saying the failure might have been caused by
errors during manufacture of the booster.
	   ``At the present moment, we definitely exclude a rocket design
error, but we can theorize about manufacturing errors,'' the press
office said in a statement quoted by the Interfax news agency.
	   Yuzhnoye officials said the cause most likely was a malfunction
in the rocket's computer, which controlled its engines. The
computer was produced by an institute in Moscow, Interfax said.
	   An official investigation was underway.
	   The launch insurance would cover the loss of satellites for
Loral, which may build another 12 satellites, and Ukraine will
provide another Zenit booster for a new launch, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Five more launches are planned by mid-1999 to put 36 more
Globalstar satellites into orbit. Two Zenit-2 rockets will carry 12
satellites each, and 12 more satellites will be put into orbit by
three Russian Soyuz rockets.
	   Yuzhnoye put the total cost of the project at dlrs 2.7 billion.
It said the accident should not lead to postponing upcoming
launches.
	   Thursday's launch was the eighth failure of the two-stage
Zenit-2 out of a total of 31, but Russian and Ukrainian officials
declare it the best in its class and have ambitious plans for the
booster.
	   The same rocket, equipped with a third stage, is to be used in
the Sea Launch international program, which would carry out
commercial launches from ocean platforms.

The stage is set for elections and it's now up to the voters

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ International supervisors
are traveling to thousands of polling stations as Bosnia gears up
for this weekend's national elections seen as crucial for a nation
still grappling the effects of a bloody ethnic war.
	   ``The elections preparations are in full swing,'' said Robert
Barry, head of the Bosnian mission for the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is supervising the
Saturday and Sunday polls.
	   Barry's 2,700 supervisors will oversee the voting of some 2.7
millions registered voters in 2,650 polling stations. Ten million
ballots have already been distributed.
	   ``We hope there will be a large voter turnout,'' Barry said. His
mission expects a turnout of between 70 and 80 percent. Partial
results are expected Tuesday, with the final figures taking more
than a week.
	   The pre-election campaign period this year ``concentrated more
on issues of substance and less emotional appeals to nationalist
sentiment,'' Barry said.
	   Media were more ``balanced and responsible'' and offered the
voters a better chance to learn about the programs of the parties
and candidates.
	   ``The stage is set for a successful election,'' he said and
urged the Bosnians to ``get out and exercise their right and their
responsibility for taking charge of their own future.''
	   The elections are financed by the European Union, which invested
10 million German Marks to cover the cost, said Ambassador Valentin
Inzko of Austria, which holds the rotating EU presidency.
	   Europe wants Bosnia to be a democratic state, he said, and
emphasized this cannot be done quickly but was rather a ste-by-step
process.
	   ``Elections, of course, do not automatically mean democracy, but
democracy is not possible without elections,'' he said.

Moody's lowers Ukraine's credit rating and issues gloomy forecast
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The U.S bond rating company Moody's has
lowered its credit rating for Ukraine and issued a gloomy forecast
for the former Soviet republic's financial future.
	   Moody's Investors Service downgraded Ukraine's B2 country rating
for foreign currency debt and B3 rating for foreign currency bank
deposits to B3 and Caa3, respectively, Moody's said in a statement
issued Wednesday.
	   The agency cited ``the depletion of Ukraine's foreign currency
reserves to dangerously low levels over the past few months'' as a
primary cause for lowering the rating, which ``implies an increase
in the risk of default on (Ukraine's) foreign debt obligations.''
	   The Ukrainian National Bank reported its reserves at about dlrs
860 million as of Wednesday, down from dlrs 1.75 billion in July
and dlrs 2.34 billion at the beginning of the year.
	   The reserves have shrunk significantly in recent weeks as the
National Bank tried to defend the national hryvna currency from the
financial crisis in Russia.
	   Moody's cited the government's recent offer to foreign investors
to exchange their Ukrainian treasury bills for long-term paper and
the announcement of a new currency trading band for the hryvna as
signs of an unstable situation in Ukraine.
	   The government devalued the hryvna last Friday by lowering the
limits of the trading corridor to 2.5 to 3.5 to the U.S. dollar,
down from 1.8 to 2.25.
	   However, Moody's said that ``while some of the pressure on the
(hryvna) is related to contagion from Russia, most of it results
from structural weaknesses in the economy and the inability of the
present as well as of the previous government to push forward a
comprehensive reform program.''
	   The agency said that the dominance of leftists in Ukraine's
parliament and upcoming presidential elections ``imply continued
slow progress on the reform side.''
	   Moody's also did not share the government's optimism over recent
approval by the International Monetary Fund of a dlrs 2.2 billion
loan to Ukraine, saying the loan would only postpone a financial
crisis if radical economic reforms are not conducted.
	   Ukraine's new B3 bond rating is practically the worst among
European countries and former Soviet republics rated by Moody's.
	   Ratings assigned by international rating agencies largely
determine the interest rate at which it can borrow from foreign
lenders.

Top Italian fugitive Licio Gelli arrested in France
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: AMs. RECASTS; UPDATES with minister saying unclear if Gelli
would go back to house arrest; ADDS BACKGROUND of previous escapes;
other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Fugitive Italian financier Licio Gelli was arrested
Thursday as he strolled down a street in Cannes, a French seaside
resort, four months after he fled his Tuscan villa.
	   Gelli, 79, was captured in a joint operation by Italian and
French police, said Italy's interior minister, Giorgio Napolitano.
	   The financier had slipped away from his guarded mansion near
Arezzo in May, a few weeks after Italy's highest court upheld his
conviction on charges of complicity in the 1982 fraudulent
bankruptcy of the Milan-based Banco Ambrosiano and sentenced him to
12 years and eight months in prison.
	   The collapse of what was once Italy's largest private bank, in
what was the nation's biggest banking scandal since the end of
World War II, was triggered by the bank's failure to collect dlrs
1.3 billion in loans made to dummy companies in Latin America.
	   Italy's national police chief, Fernando Masone, said Gelli was
carrying false documents when he was arrested in the company of
Romanian companion and his son.
	   French police in Nice said Gelli was hospitalized after
suffering a minor heart problem.
	   Napolitano said it was premature to say when Gelli might be
extradited to Italy or even to speculate if the financier would be
eligible again for house arrest instead of prison because of his
age and his ill health.
	   Banco Ambrosiano's ex-president, Roberto Calvi, known as ``God's
Banker'' because of his close ties to the Vatican, was found
hanging from a London bridge in June 1982.
	   Calvi belonged to the now-outlawed Propaganda Due (P-2) secret
lodge, headed by Gelli. The organization had been suspected of
seeking to install a right-wing dictatorship in Italy with the help
of secret service officials.
	   It was not the first escape or capture for Gelli.
	   He escaped from a Swiss jail in 1983, a year after his arrest in
a Geneva bank during the investigation of P-2 lodge activities. He
surrended in that same city four years later.
	   Gelli was extradited to Italy in 1988.
	   When Gelli disappeared in May, he was required to check in with
local police once a month and didn't have his passport.
	   Masone said police had come close to capturing Gelli a month
earlier, shortly after a brief hospitalization in Cannes.

Former minister, aide jailed over dirty war against Basque
</HEADLINE>
separatists

<TEXT>
	   GUADALAJARA, Spain (AP) _ A former Socialist Interior Minister
and his top aide went to jail on Thursday over a kidnapping that
marked the start of a covert 'dirty war' against Basque
separatists.
	   A crowd of thousands milled outside the prison in this central
Spanish town as the ex-minister, Jose Luis Barrionuevo, 56, and
former state security chief Rafael Vera, 53, arrived to begin
serving 10-year sentences.
	   Barrionuevo waved a red rose, the symbol of his Socialist Party,
as he made his way through a sea of cheering supporters. Vera
raised both arms and gave the V-for-victory sign. Both smiled and
shook hands with people in the crowd.
	   The last to say good-bye to them before they entered the
100-year-old red-brick prison was former Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez, who gave both a hug.
	   In July the Supreme Court found Barrionuevo and Vera guilty of
orchestrating the 1983 kidnapping of a Basque businessman who was
mistaken for a hitman of the armed separatist group ETA.
	   The abduction was the first act attributed to the self-styled
Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups, or GAL, which would go on to kill
27 people over the next five years in a campaign designed to crush
ETA. Many of the victims were mistaken targets.
	   ETA has killed nearly 800 people in a 30-year-old drive for an
independent state in the Basque country of northern Spain.
	   Barrionuevo and Vera had asked to remain free while they appeal
to the Constitutional Court but the Supreme Court on Tuesday
rejected their request.
	   They rode to the jail, about an hour's drive northeast of
Madrid, with Gonzalez accompanying them. Their wives followed in
another car.
	   Gonzalez has denied allegations that it was he who ordered the
creation of the GAL death squads, and the Supreme Court ruled in
1996 that there was insufficient evidence to try him in the
kidnapping case.
	   But the convictions against two senior security officials in his
government have been seen here and abroad as a stinging indictment
against Spain's best-known politician, a key figure in its
transition from decades of right-wing dictatorship to membership in
the club of Europe's elite.
	   The GAL scandal helped bring down the Gonzalez government in
1996 elections after nearly 14 years in power.
	   Critics say that if Gonzalez knew nothing about the death squads
while they were active, as he has stated, then at the very least he
is guilty of incompetence.
	   This is the first time since democracy returned to Spain in
1978, after more than three decades of right-wing dictatorship
under Gen. Francisco Franco, that a former cabinet minister has
been incarcerated.
	   In the trial, ten other defendants _ policemen, politicians and
security officials _ received sentences ranging from two years and
four months to 10 years.
	   They all pleaded guilty, some of them testifying that took part
in the kidnapping on orders from Barrionuevo and Vera. One said he
talked to Gonzalez about the GAL.
	   All 10 have requested pardons. They have yet to start serving
their jail terms.
	   Spanish newspapers reported that Barrionuevo and Vera were
allowed to choose which prison they would serve time in and picked
Guadalajara because there are no ETA members jailed there.

Iranians stand as American flag is raised, national anthem played

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranians stood Friday as the American
national anthem was played here for the first time in 19 years,
when a U.S. wrestler took first place in the World Wrestling
Championships.
	   The audience at the Azadi arena in Tehran erupted into applause
after Sam Henson defeated Namik Abdullavev of Azerbaijan 3-1 to
claim the gold medal.
	   The crowd chanted ``U.S.A.'' as the referee announced Henson's
victory.
	   The more than 12,000 spectators, among them Iranian Vice
President Mustapha Hashemi Taba, stood as a recording of the
Star-Spangled Banner blared from the arena's sound system and the
U.S. flag was raised above the Azeri and Iranian flags.
	   A U.S. wrestling team came here in February competing in a
locally organized competition in the first official visit by
Americans to Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
	   Before Henson left the winners' podium Friday, he raised the arm
of Iran's Gholamreza Mohammadie, who won the bronze.
	   After Henson received his medal, fans threw flowers at him. He
bowed in appreciation and threw some of the flowers back.
	   ``I never imagined Iranians were like this. You are the best
fans in the world. I really respect you,'' Henson told the crowd.
His comments were also broadcast live on Iranian television.
	   The return of the U.S. athletes is important to many Iranians,
who see it as further proof of the potential for improving
relations with the United States, long condemned by militant
Iranians as ``The Great Satan.''
	   In other results, Iran's top wrestler in the 97-kilogram
category, Abbas Jadidi, met the expectations of the home crowd and
took the gold medal by winning a close match against Poland's Mark
Garmulewicz on the referee's decision.
	   Bulgaria's Serafim Barzakov defeated Iran's Abbas Hajkenarie 6-2
to win gold in the 63-kilogram category while another American,
Gary Kolat, won bronze in the same class.

Iraq reacts to UN suspension of sanctions review
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout with Iraqi government calling UN vote
unjust. &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council's decision to
suspend review of Iraq's economic sanctions is ``unjust,'' the
Iraqi government said Thursday.
	   President Saddam Hussein chaired a joint meeting of the ruling
Revolution Command Council and the leadership of the Baath Party
Thursday night to discuss the Security Council's vote, the official
Iraqi News Agency said.
	   ``The leadership has discussed the continuation of the unfair
sanctions in view of the new unjust U.N resolution,'' said a
statement after the meeting.
	   It said the Iraqi leadership will meet again next week for more
discussions on the U.N. vote, apparently to work out an official
response. It did not give a specific date.
	   It said the National Assembly, or the Parliament, will also meet
to discuss vote.
	   The Security Council voted unanimously Wednesday to suspend the
six monthly reviews of the comprehensive trade sanctions imposed on
Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The resolution suspends a major, 6-month review scheduled for
October, and all subsequent 60-day reviews until Iraq resumes
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The council's move retaliated for Iraq's decision Aug. 5 to
withdraw cooperation with U.N. inspectors seeking to check the
elimination of Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction.
	   Earlier this week, Iraq warned that it would take ``decisive
measures'' against such a vote by the Security Council.
	   The leading Iraqi newspaper Babil, which is owned by Saddam's
son, was the only publication to react Thursday to the U.N. vote.
	   It said the resolution was ``neither strange nor a surprise
because the understanding is that the sanctions will continue until
the United Nations, with the United States behind it, feel that
they are losing more than they are winning.''
	   The council's stand hardens the lines between the world body and
the Iraqi government over the 8-year sanctions regime. Saddam
promised earlier this year to have the embargo lifted by early next
year.
	   But the council also gave Iraq an incentive to change its mind.
It agreed to conduct a ``comprehensive review'' of sanctions after
Iraq lets inspectors go back to work. Such a move could force the
council to acknowledge Iraq's progress of ridding itself of weapons
of mass destruction while generating pressure for a lifting of
sanctions.
	   U.N. arms experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the council will lift sanctions, which were imposed after
Iraq invaded Kuwait.
	   Iraq withdrew cooperation by refusing to provide the U.N.
inspectors with escorts, whose presence is essential to conduct
inspections.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A doctor on France's just-installed commission to
examine the use of performance-enhancing drugs in sports has
offered to resign following allegations that he prescribed illicit
drugs to a cyclist ahead of the 1997 Tour de France.
	   French daily Le Monde said Thursday that Dr. Armand Megret
prescribed Diprostene and Decadron to a cyclist whose name was not
revealed.
	   The substances were placed on a French list of drugs containing
doping agents.
	   In a statement late Thursday, just two days after it was
announced, the anti-doping group said that Megret had offered to
resign.
	   The matter will be discussed at the group's first meeting
September 15.
	   The 1998 edition of the cycling classic was tainted by a doping
scandal that spurred officials to look for ways to resolve the
widening problem of doping in sports.

Italian government considers amnesty in ``Clean Hands'' cases
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with reports after meeting &QL; 
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Trying to come up with a way to deal with a
staggering number of corruption trials, leaders of Italy's
governing center-left coalition met Thursday to consider amnesty
for anyone who confesses.
	   Thousands of politicians, businessmen and government bureaucrats
have been implicated in the corruption scandal that began in 1992
with probes by Milan's ``Clean Hands'' prosecutors and developed
nationwide into the ``Tangentopoli'' (Bribesville) investigations.
	   Now, with prosecutors buried under mounds of documentation in
thousands of cases and fears that the statute of limitations in
some instances might run out, both the government and the
opposition want trials speeded up.
	   But the two sides remain at odds over how to do it.
	   Justice Minister Giovanni Flick on Wednesday proposed offering
full or partial amnesty to anyone who confesses to corruption, news
reports said.
	   Under the plan, those who confess would either be exempt from
jail, serve leaner terms or be put under house arrest, according to
Italian newspapers Thursday.
	   Flick also proposed that those who admit to corruption be barred
from public office for at least five years.
	   But after the meeting late Thursday, the AGI new agency reported
that Flick wasn't proposing amnesty for those convicted of
Bribesville crimes but instead was urging leaner sentence for those
who confess wrongdoing.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk appealed to
the army and police Thursday to stop shooting monks and others
protesting against strongman Hun Sen, whose control of the capital
looked increasingly in doubt after days of street clashes.
	   The king's plea came after police fired into a crowd of
demonstrators Thursday, seriously wounding a student in the neck
but failing to prevent a protest that swelled to more than 6,000.
	   The king _ who has only token power but remains a force in
Cambodia _ called on authorities to ``stop using guns to shoot
demonstrators and monks. If the people do something wrong, please
don't use violence. It is killing the nation.''
	   The king's terse message and the march came during the fourth
day of police action to suppress protests against Hun Sen's rule
following disputed elections July 26.
	   But the harsh police response, which has left at least one dead
and several wounded, appeared to have emboldened the opposition.
	   ``More and more people are coming out because people have
died,'' said one protester, Penn Chan, 27.
	   The violence this week _ the worst since Hun Sen deposed
co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh in a bloody coup last year _
has undermined the legitimacy Hun Sen was seeking from the
election.
	   He won a parliamentary majority in the voting but lacks the
two-thirds needed to form a new government. The opposition alleges
massive electoral fraud and is withholding support.
	   As the protests continued, rumors of more violence swept the
capital.
	   Medical students said that seven Buddhist monks were beaten at
their school and at least one beheaded. But human rights workers
later were unable to find any evidence of such action.
	   Authorities acknowledged that one protester has been killed
since the crackdown began Monday. But many have been wounded by
gunfire and scores injured by police using clubs, cattle prods,
rifle butts and water cannons.
	   In addition, many protesters believe that several Buddhist monks
were killed Wednesday when police disrupted a rally outside the
U.S. Embassy and the nearby home of Ranariddh. But a search of
hospitals and morgues produced no bodies.
	   Human rights workers said they unearthed two bodies, both
shooting victims, from a shallow grave near the airport Thursday.
They appeared to have been killed Wednesday, the workers said.
	   Gunfire erupted Thursday after a few hundred protesters gathered
again outside the embassy. When protesters threw rocks toward
police, five officers opened fire with their rifles, at least two
shooting directly into the crowd and striking an 18-year-old man in
the neck.
	   Police chased protesters for several hours until they gathered
near the Angkor-style Independence Monument and began a slow
procession through the city.
	   In an unexpected outpouring of public support, the march built
up strength from a few hundred to more than 6,000 as bystanders
joined in.
	   Police left them largely unmolested for about two hours until
they massed again at the Independence Monument, when about 150
elite Flying Tiger police arrived, joined by 150 police on
motorcycles, soldiers in trucks and four water cannon.
	   The marchers scattered into a nearby park and toward the Mekong
river. No shots were fired and the police did not use clubs.
Eventually, the police left and the marchers regrouped and cheered.

Former minister, aide jailed over dirty war against Basque
</HEADLINE>
separatists
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quote from Barrionuevo in 9th graf &QR; 

<TEXT>
	   GUADALAJARA, Spain (AP) _ A former Socialist Interior Minister
and his top aide went to jail on Thursday over a kidnapping that
marked the start of a covert 'dirty war' against Basque
separatists.
	   A crowd of thousands milled outside the prison in this central
Spanish town as the ex-minister, Jose Luis Barrionuevo, 56, and
former state security chief Rafael Vera, 53, arrived to begin
serving 10-year sentences.
	   Barrionuevo waved a red rose, the symbol of his Socialist Party,
as he made his way through a sea of cheering supporters. Vera
raised both arms and gave the V-for-victory sign. Both smiled and
shook hands with people in the crowd.
	   The last to say good-bye to them before they entered the
century-old, red-brick prison was former Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez, who gave both a hug.
	   In July the Supreme Court found Barrionuevo and Vera guilty of
orchestrating the 1983 kidnapping of a Basque businessman who was
mistaken for a hitman of the armed separatist group ETA.
	   The abduction was the first act attributed to the self-styled
Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups, or GAL, which would go on to kill
27 people over the next five years in a campaign designed to crush
ETA. Many of the victims were mistaken targets.
	   ETA has killed nearly 800 people in a 30-year-old drive for an
independent state in the Basque country of northern Spain.
	   Barrionuevo and Vera had asked to remain free while they appeal
to the Constitutional Court but the Supreme Court on Tuesday
rejected the request.
	   They protested their innocence to the end. Addressing the crowd
outside the prison, Barrionuevo said: ``We are here to fulfill an
order that is legal but unjust.''
	   The crowd answered by chanting ``injustice! injustice!''
	   Gonzalez rode with the defendants on the hour-long drive to the
jail. Their wives followed in another car.
	   Gonzalez has denied allegations that it was he who ordered the
creation of the GAL death squads, and the Supreme Court ruled in
1996 that there was insufficient evidence to try him in the
kidnapping case.
	   But the convictions against two senior security officials in his
government have been seen here and abroad as a stinging indictment
against Spain's best-known politician, a key figure in its
transition from decades of right-wing dictatorship to membership in
the club of Europe's elite.
	   The GAL scandal helped bring down the Gonzalez government in
1996 elections after nearly 14 years in power.
	   Critics say that if Gonzalez knew nothing about the death squads
while they were active, as he has stated, then at the very least he
is guilty of incompetence.
	   This is the first time since democracy returned to Spain in
1978, after more than three decades of right-wing dictatorship
under Gen. Francisco Franco, that a former cabinet minister has
been incarcerated.
	   In the trial, ten other defendants _ policemen, politicians and
security officials _ received sentences ranging from two years and
four months to 10 years.
	   They all pleaded guilty, some of them testifying that took part
in the kidnapping on orders from Barrionuevo and Vera. One said he
talked to Gonzalez about the GAL.
	   All 10 have requested pardons. They have yet to start serving
their jail terms.
	   Spanish newspapers reported that Barrionuevo and Vera were
allowed to pick their prison and chose Guadalajara because there
are no ETA members housed there.

Ross says he finds Israel, Palestinians ready to make progress
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Ross meeting top Palestinian officials, pro- and
anti-Ross demonstrations &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli and Palestinian leaders have shown
readiness to move forward on a deal for a West Bank troop
withdrawal, but several points of dispute remain, a U.S. mediator
said Thursday.
	   Palestinians, meanwhile, said there was reason for
encouragement.
	   The envoy, Dennis Ross, held separate talks Thursday with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and top Palestinian
officials, following his meeting Wednesday with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
	   Ross said his mission would continue for at least several more
days.
	   ``I'm seeing whether or not it's possible to narrow the
differences,'' Ross told reporters after briefing Israeli President
Ezer Weizman. ``The initial sets of discussions, I think, have
indicated the desire to try to find ways.''
	   However, Weizman _ when asked whether he was more optimistic
after hearing from Ross _ answered with a curt: ``No.''
	   Later, the American envoy met for 3 1/2 hours with Arafat deputy
Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, and Palestinian parliament
speaker Ahmed Qureia, also known as Abu Ala.
	   ``I am encouraged,' Abbas said. ``I hope we will reach _ it is
very difficult _ a conclusion ... We hope to bridge the
differences, but we are still at the beginning.''
	   Outside the Jerusalem hotel where the talks took place, small
groups of opposing demonstrators faced off. Protesting the visit
were about 30 right-wing activists who carried signs reading ``Ross
Bug Off'' and ``No more land to Arafat.''
	   About a dozen counter-demonstrators from the group Peace Now
waved signs saying ``Save the peace process.''
	   Ross is accompanied by Jonathan Schwartz, a U.S. State
Department legal adviser who drafted the 1997 agreement on an
Israeli withdrawal from most of the West Bank town of Hebron.
	   The Haaretz daily said Thursday that Ross hoped to get something
on paper by the weekend. However, sources close to the negotiations
said there was no indication that the two sides had reached the
stage of writing a draft.
	   On the table is a U.S. proposal for an Israeli withdrawal from
13 percent of the West Bank and detailed provisions for Palestinian
cooperation with Israel and the United States on security.
	   Israel initially rejected a 13 percent pullback, but then said
it would agree, provided that 3 percent of that area is declared a
nature reserve in which Israel retains security control and the
Palestinians are not be allowed to build.
	   The Palestinians have said they accepted temporary restrictions,
but wanted assurances that the area eventually come under full
Palestinian control.
	   Asked about the Palestinian demands, Netanyahu adviser David
Bar-Illan, said Thursday: ``We don't believe that would be an
obstacle. The main thing is that we would have security control and
the veto on construction which would prevent the building of
military installations.''
	   The most difficult issue facing Ross is Israel's demand to
renegotiate an agreement on security cooperation.
	   A blueprint for Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation and a
Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants was worked out by
Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. security officials last December, but
was rejected by Netanyahu as insufficient.
	   The Palestinians initially said they would not agree to changes,
but in recent days have softened their position.
	   In other developments Thursday, a Palestinian woman hurt during
clashes in a Jerusalem refugee camp died of her wounds.
	   The woman, 41-year-old Kamila Nather, was walking in the street
on Saturday when she was struck in the face by a rubber-coated
steel pellet fired by Israeli troops trying to disperse Palestinian
stone throwers.

Report: Hundreds more have died in eastern Sierra Leone town
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ More than 300 people have died
since late June from hunger and disease in an eastern town jammed
with refugees fleeing brutal fighting that continues to tear at
this West African country, a local newspaper said Thursday.
	   Quoting local aid officials, Unity Now newspaper said about 330
people died between late June and mid-August in the town of
Massingbi.
	   In July, a United Nations officials said at least 750 people had
died in the same town over the previous few months. A total count
of fatalities in Massingbi was not immediately available, though it
was believed to be _ at least _ near 1,000.
	   Hunger related diseases like diarrhea are striking many people,
aid officials say. Compounding those problems, a chronic lack of
medical supplies have made it difficult for the health troubles to
be treated, the newspaper said.
	   A Nigerian-led intervention force drove Sierra Leone's military
junta from power in February, but junta loyalists and their rebel
allies continue to wage war in areas across the country. Many of
their attacks are against civilians, thousands of whom have been
murdered, mutilated and raped.
	   Intervention force officials, now fighting on behalf of
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah _ whom they restored to the presidency
by driving out the junta _ say the rebels are weakened but still
able to fight.
	   Thousands of civilians have been driven from their homes, while
scores have had hands and arms amputated, or have been tortured or
killed by the rebels.

French Interior Minister out of coma
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with reaction from French President Jacques
Chirac, background, ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By DEBORAH SEWARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's interior minister emerged from a coma
Thursday, a week after he suffered an allergic reaction to
anesthesia during a gall bladder operation, a Defense Ministry
statement said.
	   Following a reduction in the drugs used to keep him sedated,
Jean-Pierre Chevenement was able to recognize members of his
family, the statement said.
	   Chevenement, a key political ally of Socialist Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin, fell into a coma Sept. 2 after suffering a heart
attack during surgery.
	   French President Jacques Chirac welcomed the news and said he
hoped that Chevenement's condition would continue to improve so
that he could resume his duties.
	   ``I don't have to tell you how much I am delighted about the
positive progress of the health of the Interior Minister,'' Chirac
said.
	   The 59-year-old minister, who is in charge of the nation's
police and security forces, remains on respiratory and kidney
dialysis, the statement said.
	   It confirmed that the allergy was caused by a reaction to curare
in the anesthetic. Curare is used to relax muscles, including
during surgery.
	   The statement said nothing, however, about any lasting
neurological damage he may have suffered.
	   Contrary to a report earlier this week in the Liberation daily,
the weekly magazine Impact Medecin quoted the doctor in charge as
saying Chevenement did have two required anesthesia consultations
ahead of his surgery.
	   Dr. Yves Cudennec of Val de Grace military hospital was quoted
as saying one of the consultations was on July 30 and the other
just before the planned operation.
	   On Tuesday, Liberation reported that Chevenement did not receive
the two consultations and was not given a test for a potential
allergic reaction to the anesthesia.
	   Chevenement has held a number of other ministry portfolios
during his political career, including defense, industry,
education.
	   After three years as defense minister, he resigned in 1991 to
protest France's involvement in the U.S.-led Gulf War coalition
against Iraq.

Clarke edges closer to No. 1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COVENTRY, England (AP) _ Darren Clarke edged closer to deposing
Lee Westwood as European No. 1 on Thursday when he hit a
5-under-par 67 to grab a one-stroke lead at the 750,000 pound (dlrs
1.25 million) British Masters.
	   The Northern Ireland golfer fired six birdies in his opening
round on the par 72 Forest of Arden course to lead from
Switzerland's Paola Quirici, who shot a 4-under par 68.
	   Quirici hit a hole-in-one at the 196-yard fifth hole, his 14th,
and was 5-under until a bogey on the eighth cost him a stroke and a
share of the lead.
	   Scotland's Sam Torrence is one stroke further back on 3-under
with former England youth international Carl Suneson, who now
registered on the tour as Spanish player, and English pair Andrew
Sherbourne and Robert Lee.
	   Clarke, who finished third at the European Masters at
Crans-Sur-Sierre, Switzerland, on the weekend and was runner-up
twice in his previous four events, is currently 5,500 pounds (dlrs
9,000) behind Westwood at the top of the tour money list.
	   The 125,000 pound (dlrs 206,250) winners' purse would give him
the lead with just four tournaments remaining.
	   Clarke started brilliantly, holing from the edge of the green at
the 11th and then sinking a 25-foot putt on the 12th for his second
birdie in three holes.
	   He birdied the 14th and 15th holes and turned in 32. He bogeyed
the second but recovered with birdies onthe third and sixth for 35
on the second nine.
	   Clarke said he never contemplated withdrawing from the Masters
despite coming down with a cold on Tuesday.
	   He said the illness had actually helped his timing because he
wasn't hitting the ball as hard as normal.
	   ``I can't remember the course playing as tough as that, but it's
good. The rough is penal and it demands every shot in the bag,'' he
said.
	   Scotland's Colin Montgomerie, who has finished first once and
runner-up three times in his last four tournaments at Forest of
Arden, shot a 2-under 70 to finish three shots off the pace.
	   The five-time European No. 1, who carded an eagle on the
526-yard seventh hole, said he was getting his game back on track.
	   ``It's never been complicated before and I want to get back to
where it's not. I want to free-flow and concentrate on course
management rather than my swing,'' he said.
	   Lee Westwood went around in 73 to finish 1-over, while Ian
Woosnam finished 3-over with a first-round 75.
	   While Clarke, Westwood and Montgomerie battle for the No. 1 spot
on the tour, England's British Open star Justin Rose is battling to
avoid tour qualifying school.
	   Rose, whose equal-fourth place at the British Open was the best
finish by an amateur since 1953, has missed five cuts in five
tournaments since turning pro after the Open in July.
	   The 18-year-old needs to earn at least 55,000 at the British
Masters and German Masters to finish in the top 116 on the tour and
qualify for a tour card next year but he started drastically with
an 8-over-par 80.
	   He is 13 strokes behind Clarke after he double-bogeyed on the
fourth and bogeyed the fifth, sixth and seventh to turn in 43, the
worst nine of the event to date.

Iran vows to punish Taliban

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Iranian reaction to Taliban
announcement that 9 Iranian dipomats are dead; CHANGES overline. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran on Thursday vowed to punish
Afghanistan's Taliban militia for the deaths of nine of its
diplomats, Iranian television reported.
	   The Iranian Foreign Ministry said Iran held the Taliban and
Pakistan responsible for the deaths, adding that it ``reserved the
right to defend its people against aggression.''
	   It demanded the immediate repatriation of the diplomats' bodies
and the release of all Iranians held in Afghanistan.
	   Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia confirmed Thursday that
nine of 11 Iranian diplomats missing in Afghanistan for a month are
dead. But it denied its fighters were involved in their deaths.
	   Iran has for weeks accused the Taliban, which controls most of
Afghanistan, of holding some 70 Iranians, including 11 diplomats
and a journalist, but the Taliban had denied any knowledge of the
whereabouts of the diplomats.
	   The diplomats and the journalist went missing after the Taliban
overran the city of Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan on Aug.
8.
	   ``Taliban will have to pay a heavy price for this unfair and
ugly act,'' a commentary on state-run television said Thursday
night.
	   ``Iran reserves the right to respond to this ugly and inhumane
action by any means necessitated by its national security. Iran
recognizes it as its right to punish Taliban,'' said the broadcast.
	   Neither the television commentary nor the Foreign Ministry said
what action Iran would take.
	   Earlier Thursday, Iran's army chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Ali
Shahbazi, said new maneuvers would be held on Iran's border with
Afghanistan. He did not give a starting date for the exercises.
	   Some 70,000 elite Iranian soldiers _ backed by tanks and
helicopter gun ships _ held three days of maneuvers near the border
earlier this month in a show of strength against Afghanistan.
	   The new exercises will be ``unprecedented in terms of scope and
variety of operations'' and will include artillery units and
armored units, Shahbazi said.
	   He added that the maneuvers, code named Zolfaqar, were
``inevitable, considering the increased security disturbances on
our eastern borders.''
	   The U.S. State Department has expressed concern about rising
tensions between Iran and Afghanistan and has urged both sides to
exercise restraint.
	   On Thursday, Iranian radio said that the leader of the Taliban _
Mullah Mohammed Omar _ personally ordered his forces to detain the
Iranian diplomats and the journalist.
	   It said that Omar ordered 15 armed men to enter the Iranian
consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif to take them as ``hostages.''
	   Last Thursday, the Taliban freed five Iranian prisoners in a
goodwill gesture.
	   Meanwhile, Ghorbanali Dorri Najafabadi, Iran's intelligence
minister, said he had information that Taliban forces had entered
the consulate with the help of Pakistani intelligence forces.
	   Pakistan is seen as a major backer of the Taliban, while Iran
has supported the Afghan opposition forces.

Ukraine's parliament approves criminal code banning death penalty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine took a first step toward abolishing
capital punishment on Thursday after the country's legislature gave
preliminary approval to a new criminal code, a news report said.
	   The code, supported by 242 deputies in Ukraine's 450-seat
parliament, permits use of the death penalty only during martial
law, the Interfax news agency reported. It sill has to pass two
more readings to take effect.
	   Ukraine pledged to halt capital punishment when it joined the
Council of Europe in 1995, but has executed at least 180 people
since then.
	   Last January the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly
threatened to suspend Ukraine's membership unless it outlawed the
punishment. The threat was not implemented after Ukraine promised
to take swift action.
	   The 40-nation Council of Europe was created in 1949 to promote
democracy, human rights and the rule of law. It is best known for
its European Convention on Human Rights which forbids members from
executing criminals.
	   Amnesty International, a human rights group, put Ukraine in
second place after China on its list of countries that carried out
executions in 1996.

Rains hampering aid flights to flooding victims in southern Mexico

	   TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) _ Heavy rain and poor visibility delayed
aid flights Thursday to southern Mexican towns where thousands of
people waited desperately for drinking water and food after losing
homes to raging rivers.
	   Neither federal or Chiapas state authorities had yet to deliver
aid to one of the worst-affected cities, Pijijiapan, Mayor Gilberto
de los Santos said Thursday. Flooding has killed at least 18 people
in Pijijiapan, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Tapachula.
	   A Chiapas state spokesman said a total of 26 deaths were
confirmed and at least 60 people were missing in what was reported
as the region's worst flooding in 50 years. The dead included a
police officer who drowned during a rescue operation in Pijijiapan;
five other officers were missing.
	   At least 10 people in other states have died due to the storms
over the past week.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo, who flew to Tapachula late Wednesday,
began a helicopter tour of affected areas Thursday.
	   ``It's a very grave situation,'' he said before the trip.
	   A tour of Chiapas state, where Zapatista rebels rose up in arms
against the Mexican government, by about 50 diplomats was canceled
due to the disaster.
	   The Red Cross appealed for donations of clothing and drinking
water. Relief teams collected bundles of supplies in Mexico City.
	   Radio reports said fuel supplies also were running low in
Tapachula, a city of 250,000 people 10 miles (15 kilometers) from
the Guatemalan border.
	   Rain continued to fall Thursday in Tapachula, which had received
22.5 inches (57 centimeters) of precipitation since Monday morning.
In Arriaga, a Chiapas town near the Oaxaca state border, more than
16 inches (40 centimeters) of rain had fallen since Tuesday
morning.
	   Muddy flood waters turned streets into violent rivers, sweeping
away roads and bridges and tearing down walls from concrete houses.
Chiapas authorities said seven bridges had fallen and another four
had suffered structural damage.
	   At least 20,000 people had been affected by the rain in Chiapas;
4,500 of them had sought refuge in temporary shelters, the state
government said. Sixty communities reported material damage.
	   Forecasters predicted more rain for southern and eastern Mexico
due to Tropical Storm Frances. Northwestern Mexico, meanwhile was
being soaked by Tropical Depression Javier in the Pacific. The
northwestern states of Jalisco, Nayarit and Sinaloa reported
flooding.
	   Police in Nayarit recovered the body of Maria Alberta Bautista,
a 23-year-old mother of three, near the community of El Faisan. Two
farm workers were found dead Wednesday in a river near the Sinaloa
capital, Culiacan.
	   In Jalisco, the body of a 17-year-old camper, Karina Sanchez
Gonzalez, was recovered Wednesday near Zapopan. She was swept away
Sunday while camping near a waterfall.
	   Officials in Oaxaca on Thursday reported two deaths in coastal
communities _ one of a man whose house collapsed due to flooding
and another of a woman who drowned in a rain-gorged river.

Generals from former Angolan rebel group break with leader Savimbi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ In an apparent break with their leader
Jonas Savimbi, eight army generals from the former rebel group
UNITA on Thursday urged the movement's troops to stop attacking
government positions and surrender their weapons.
	   ``We call on all ... former UNITA fighters to stop making war
and lay down their arms,'' UNITA Gen. Demostenes Chilingutila said
in a statement read in the capital Luanda.
	   The government, which signed a peace pact with UNITA in 1994 to
end their two-decade civil war, has accused Savimbi and some of his
troops of being behind recent attacks on rural villages.
	   The attacks reportedly have killed more than 100 civilians and
police and have jeopardized implementation of the outstanding
provisions of the United Nations-brokered peace accord.
	   ``A war would no longer be to defend anyone. It would not be
justifiable,'' Gen. Chiligutila said, flanked by seven other UNITA
generals.
	   Among them was Gen. Arlindo Chenda Pena, known as Gen. Ben-Ben,
who is Savimbi's nephew and who led UNITA's army during the civil
war.
	   The eight generals had joined the country's combined armed
forces as part of the peace deal and are living in Luanda.
	   Savimbi has refused to leave his central highland stronghold in
Andulo, 480 kilometers (300 miles) southeast of Luanda, and has not
been seen in public for years.
	   The generals' announcement was the latest sign that Savimbi's
support within UNITA, which he has led since creating the group
more than 30 years ago, is crumbling.
	   Senior UNITA officials in Luanda last week said they would no
longer follow Savimbi.
	   The dissidents, including former senior UNITA spokesman Jorge
Valentim and Eugenio Manuvakola, the group's former
secretary-general, accused Savimbi of not wanting peace.
	   The U.N. Security Council has imposed sanctions on UNITA, a
Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, for its failure to comply with the peace
accord.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Strong winds and high seas prevented
divers from pursuing their search Thursday for the cockpit voice
recorder of Swissair Flight 111.
	   On shore, investigators examined debris from the cockpit for
signs of fire damage. An investigation spokesman, Jim Harris, said
tests were being conducted on a wool seat cover from the cockpit
that appeared to have been seared.
	   Waves at the crash site, five miles off the Nova Scotia shore,
were as high as 18 feet (six meters) _ the roughest seas since
search operations began after the wide-bodied MD-11 crashed Sept.
2, killing all 229 people on board.
	   Lt. Robert Frank, a Canadian military spokesman, said divers
were disappointed by the weather and eager to resume their search
at a depth of 190 feet (60 meters) for the cockpit voice recorder.
Signals from the device have been detected near several large
pieces of wreckage believed to be the plane's fuselage.
	   The crash occurred about 90 minutes after the plane left Kennedy
International Airport for Geneva, Switzerland, when the aircraft
was attempting to make an emergency landing at Halifax but fell
into the sea some 30 miles (50 kilometers) away.
	   The pilots reported smoke billowing into the cockpit.
	   On Wednesday, political leaders, rescue workers and hundreds of
local residents joined grieving family members for an outdoor
memorial service for the victims. Many mourners wept as the 229
names were read one by one.
	   In attendance were Canadian Minister Jean Chretien, Swiss
President Flavio Cotti and U.S. Ambassador Gordon Giffin. More than
130 Americans died in the crash.
	   Claire Mortimer, whose father, John Mortimer, was killed in the
crash, thanked the local community on behalf of victims' families.
	   ``Your outpouring of help will never be forgotten,'' she said.
	   Moments later, Mortimer cried quietly as a helicopter dropped a
wreath over St. Margaret's Bay.
	   Swissair got an assist Thursday from another European airline.
	   The Italian charter company Air Europe is taking over Swissair's
Zurich-to-Montreal route until further notice because Swissair,
following the crash, is a plane short.
	   Air Europe will provide a Boeing 767 plus two pilots and eight
crew for the two flights, while Swissair will provide the rest of
the crew, SAirGroup spokeswoman Beatrice Tschanz said in Zurich.
	   ``We take this as a sign of how much other airlines are
supporting Swissair in this period,'' Tschanz said.
	   Speculation about the cause of the crash continues, with several
aviation experts blaming Kapton, which is widely used as
electrical-wiring insulation in commercial jets.
	   The U.S. military banned the use of Kapton 11 years ago because
it was prone to breakdown.

Ross says he finds Israel, Palestinians ready to make progress
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Ross meeting top Palestinian officials, pro- and
anti-Ross demonstrations &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli and Palestinian leaders have shown
readiness to move forward on a deal for a West Bank troop
withdrawal, but several points of dispute remain, the U.S. Mideast
envoy said Thursday.
	   Palestinians, meanwhile, said there was reason for
encouragement.
	   The envoy, Dennis Ross, held separate talks Thursday with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and top Palestinian
officials, following his meeting Wednesday with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
	   Ross said his mission would continue for at least several more
days.
	   ``I'm seeing whether or not it's possible to narrow the
differences,'' Ross said after briefing Israel's figurehead
president, Ezer Weizman. ``The initial sets of discussions, I
think, have indicated the desire to try to find ways.''
	   However, Weizman _ when asked whether he was more optimistic
after hearing from Ross _ answered with a curt: ``No.''
	   Later, the American envoy met for 3 1/2 hours with Arafat deputy
Mahmoud Abbas and Palestinian parliament speaker Ahmed Qureia.
	   ``I am encouraged,' Abbas said. ``I hope we will reach _ it is
very difficult _ a conclusion ... We hope to bridge the
differences, but we are still at the beginning.''
	   Outside the Jerusalem hotel where the talks took place, small
groups of opposing demonstrators faced off. Protesting the visit
were about 30 right-wing activists who carried signs reading ``Ross
Bug Off'' and ``No more land to Arafat.''
	   About a dozen counter-demonstrators from the group Peace Now
waved signs saying ``Save the peace process.''
	   Ross is accompanied by Jonathan Schwartz, a U.S. State
Department legal adviser who drafted the 1997 agreement on an
Israeli withdrawal from most of the West Bank town of Hebron.
	   The Haaretz daily said Thursday that Ross hoped to get something
on paper by the weekend. However, sources close to the negotiations
said there was no indication that the two sides had reached the
stage of writing a draft.
	   The two sides are negotiating over a U.S. proposal for an
Israeli withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank and detailed
provisions for Palestinian cooperation with Israel and the United
States on security.
	   Israel initially rejected the 13 percent figure, but then said
it would agree if 3 percent of that area is declared a nature
reserve in which Israel retains security control and the
Palestinians are not be allowed to build.
	   The Palestinians have said they accepted temporary restrictions,
but wanted assurances that the area eventually come under full
Palestinian control.
	   Asked about the Palestinian demands, Netanyahu adviser David
Bar-Illan, said Thursday: ``We don't believe that would be an
obstacle. The main thing is that we would have security control and
the veto on construction which would prevent the building of
military installations.''
	   The most difficult issue facing Ross is Israel's demand to
renegotiate an agreement on security cooperation.
	   A blueprint for Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation and a
Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants was worked out by
Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. security officials last December, but
was rejected by Netanyahu as insufficient.
	   The Palestinians initially said they would not agree to changes,
but in recent days have softened their position.
	   In other developments Thursday, a 41-year-old Palestinian woman
hurt during clashes in a Jerusalem refugee camp died of her wounds.
	   The woman was walking in the street on Saturday when she was
struck in the face by a rubber-coated steel pellet fired by Israeli
troops trying to disperse Palestinian stone throwers.

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Here are excerpts from editorials in publications in various
countries:
	    &UR; ___
	   Svenska Dagbladet, Stockholm, Sweden, on Afghanistan-Iran:
	   The conflict between the mullahs in Iran and the Taliban in
Afghanistan has many dimensions. An important factor is Iran's
geostrategic interest in the region. During the chaos of civil war
in Afghanistan, Tehran, though its support to the regime that
formerly controlled Kabul, stretched its influence well into
Central Asia. That was something that was not looked up favorably
from Pakistan, which originally was the Taliban's foremost base of
support.
	   Another is that Iran's foreign policy has regarded support of
Shiite Muslims in the area as a key to influence in the region and
that the Shiite Muslims in Afghanistan belong to the losers since
the Taliban's successes. Amnesty International reports that the
Taliban, in connection with the capture of the city of
Mazar-e-Sharif, massacred thousands of Shiite Muslims who supported
the former regime.
	   A third factor is the differences in the interpretations of
Islam. This is less a matter of Shiites against Sunnis as it is
that Tehran stands for a radical and mass-mobilizing variant of
Islam whereas the Taliban are fundamentalists in the word's real
sense.
	   ... The ongoing conflict between Tehran and Kabul is a reminder
that even in the Muslim world, despite all statements to the
contrary, is driven by the strategic game's eternal rules: balance
of power and self-interest.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Sydney Morning Herald, Sydney, Australia, on Indonesia:
	   Fresh clashes between Indonesian anti-riot police and student
protesters in Jakarta invite comparison with the clashes that
helped bring down former President Suharto in May. Indeed, one
student has termed this latest campaign `round two' in the
continuing struggle to rid Indonesia of a corrupt and undemocratic
leadership.
	   But this time there are fundamentally different considerations
at work. The swift action of the police to disperse students
outside Parliament suggest the security forces are in no mood to
tolerate another challenge from the streets while the country is on
the brink of economic and social collapse.
	   Indonesians are distracted by larger concerns, notably survival,
as living standards plummet and the prices of even basic
commodities such as rice soar beyond the reach of ordinary
families.
	   Hunger is a bigger threat to stability than moral or political
principle and hunger has already produced food riots in several
parts of Indonesia. The potential for widespread upheaval cannot be
discounted.
	    &UR; ___
	   Asahi Shimbun, Tokyo, on North Korea:
	   Kim Jong Il was appointed leader of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (North Korea) by that country's Supreme People's
Assembly, or the parliament. The country had been formally
(although not effectively) without leadership for almost four years
following the death of former President Kim Il Sung.
	   People throughout the world were eager to hear him lay out his
policies in a speech to the assembly _ as his father used to do _
but he did not speak.
	   Does he plan to enhance his prestige by veiling himself in
mystery? It is certainly abnormal to have a silent supreme leader
in the present-day world.
	   It is typical of North Korean diplomacy to adeptly alternate
strong-arm tactics with smiling entreaties. Kim Jong Il is no doubt
taking the lead in this style of diplomacy. It is consistent with
this diplomacy that North would make light of the missile-test
reactions in South Korea and Japan while making much of
negotiations with the United States.
	   What is the North's real intention? How is it related to the
easing of tension in Northwest Asia? To deal with North Korea, we
have to find answers to these questions.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Times, London, on U.S. President Bill Clinton:
	   The one word from Bill Clinton's journeys to Russia, Ulster and
Ireland that echoed back across the Atlantic was the word
``sorry.'' Back in Washington this week, the isolated incumbent of
the White House can take the full measure of the damage that his
long refusal to pronounce that word has wreaked.
	   Clinton has barely a defender of note left. And it is friendly
fire, not Republican sniping, that has holed his ship.
	   Because Clinton rashly claimed that his denial under oath of a
sexual relationship was ``legally accurate,'' (Kenneth Starr's)
report is bound to go into every squalid sexual detail. Visibly
estranged from even his wife, the president is so politically
emasculated that he can no longer assure such vital Congress votes
as the funding of the IMF that is urgently required to calm the
financial storms. Resignation now, before the risk of an
impeachment that could tip an already unstable world toward
depression, looks increasingly the best option.

	   The Jordan Times, Amman, Jordan, on the Middle East:
	   (Jordan's) Crown Prince Hassan, the regent, has effectively put
an end to all speculations and assumptions about new pacts,
alliances or axes in the Middle East to which Jordan would be
party.
	   The kind of new Middle Eastern order that Jordan aspires for
would include Iraq, Iran and Syria and would extend from Morocco in
the West to the central Asian republics in the East. The ultimate
purpose of the new order would be to articulate an enlightened
definition of what constitutes security to ensure, as the Regent
put it, that security is not about arms and military superiority
but ultimately about human dignity.
	   Jordan did not, and is not promoting pacts. It is promoting
conflict prevention centers, conflict resolution centers and a
regional conversation through which all countries of the area will
articulate a code of conduct that will comprehensively address
absolute, and significant issues of concern.
	   This new methodology will simply make the Middle East a safer
and better place in which to live.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Straits Times, Singapore, on North Korea:
	   Unhappily, Pyongyang treated even the tragedy of famine as an
opportunity to extract political concessions. Its nuclear program
was also manipulated to obtain a handsome deal in the shape of a
consortium set up by the Americans and funded by the South (Korea)
and Japan.
	   Now, however, the North would do well to realize that the time
for such blackmailing tactics is past. No one wants to starve it
into submission. No one would wish to halt it in its technological
tracks and force to unscramble what it has achieved. Progress is a
one-way street.
	   But unless progress is for peace, the lesson can be swift and
dire. Any attempt to follow up Monday's test with other weapons ...
would destroy confidence. Pyongyang cannot afford that if it still
hopes for the huge South Korean investment that alone can raise
living standards and ultimately enable the two neighbors to discuss
unification on a level playing field.
	    &UR; ___
	   St. Petersburg Times, St. Petersburg, Florida, on the Internet:
	   Come now the higher minds at Carnegie Mellon University with the
news that people on the Internet are lonely and depressed. That is
no revelation. Sad and lonely people are why the Internet exists.
	   These are the same people, after all, who held an online chat
with Koko the gorilla. Millions use the Net as TV on-demand or as a
stalking ground for simulated sex. It is axiomatic, of course, that
cruising the Net leaves people less time to volunteer or socialize
or coach youth sports. People have only so many hours a day to be
distracted and depressed.
	   Is it any wonder, what with Internet gambling and Baywatch on
the Web, that Americans are holding fewer dinner parties, voting
less and skipping church?
	   Researchers at Carnegie's Human Computer Interaction Institute
tracked 93 families in the Pittsburgh area. They now will examine
whether watching TV has the same effect. If television is a fantasy
world, the Web is the real world, and reality is nearly always more
depressing than fantasy.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, on faltering world markets:
	   It's too early to know what exactly the jittery stock market
portends, but there's no question that it's sending out warnings.
	   Nationally, where some Republican members of Congress are hoping
to push a politically popular tax cut through, growing economic
uncertainties argue for caution.
	   The market's sudden drop also raises important questions about
the wisdom of one of the Social Security reform proposals,
investing Social Security funds in the stock market. That idea
looked more attractive when the market was on a steady pace upward
than it does now.
	   Warnings, of course, don't necessarily mean a recession's at
hand. But they certainly argue for caution in anticipating the
future, even as they remind us that despite all the wishful
thinking, economic cycles haven't yet been repealed.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Daily Oklahoman, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on missile attack:
	   Recently, U.S. Sen. James Inhofe, Republican-Tulsa, asked Gen.
Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to comment
on a new report questioning U.S. readiness to deal with a
long-range missile attack. The general's response was illuminating,
particularly so in light of North Korea's subsequent test of a
missile capable of carrying nuclear warheads.
	   Inhofe raised the issue after release of the Rumsfeld Commission
Report, warning a missile threat may come sooner than many in the
U.S. government think. The panel said it's possible an enemy could
develop a ballistic missile program in a way that would give the
United States little or no warning before an attack.
	   In fairness, Shelton and the joint chiefs answer to Bill
Clinton, so it's not surprising they echo his administration's
soft-line on missile defense. ...
	   The Oklahoman urges Inhofe ... and other patriots in Congress to
hold hearings highlighting America's vulnerability to missile
attack. Bold action is needed to counter Clinton's idle approach to
defending the U.S. against a grave and growing threat.

French Interior Minister out of coma
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction from French Prime Minister in 4th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By DEBORAH SEWARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's interior minister emerged from a coma
Thursday, a week after he suffered an allergic reaction to
anesthesia during a gall bladder operation, a Defense Ministry
statement said.
	   Following a reduction in the drugs used to keep him sedated,
Jean-Pierre Chevenement was able to recognize members of his
family, the statement said.
	   Chevenement, a key political ally of Socialist Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin, fell into a coma Sept. 2 after suffering a heart
attack during surgery.
	   ``The fact that Jean-Pierre Chevenement has come out of a coma
give me much joy and also hope,'' said Jospin upon his return to
France from a visit to Finland.
	   French President Jacques Chirac also welcomed the news and said
he hoped that Chevenement's condition would continue to improve so
that he could resume his duties.
	   ``I don't have to tell you how much I am delighted about the
positive progress of the health of the Interior Minister,'' Chirac
said.
	   The 59-year-old minister, who is in charge of the nation's
police and security forces, remains on respiratory and kidney
dialysis, the statement said.
	   It confirmed that the allergy was caused by a reaction to curare
in the anesthetic. Curare is used to relax muscles, including
during surgery.
	   The statement said nothing, however, about any lasting
neurological damage he may have suffered.
	   Contrary to a report earlier this week in the Liberation daily,
the weekly magazine Impact Medecin quoted the doctor in charge as
saying Chevenement did have two required anesthesia consultations
ahead of his surgery.
	   Dr. Yves Cudennec of Val de Grace military hospital was quoted
as saying one of the consultations was on July 30 and the other
just before the planned operation.
	   On Tuesday, Liberation reported that Chevenement did not receive
the two consultations and was not given a test for a potential
allergic reaction to the anesthesia.
	   Chevenement has held a number of other ministry portfolios
during his political career, including defense, industry,
education.
	   After three years as defense minister, he resigned in 1991 to
protest France's involvement in the U.S.-led Gulf War coalition
against Iraq.

Zimbabwe invites bids for railway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The Zimbabwe government is seeking bids
to manage and operate the national railways in a move that would be
the country's largest privatization yet, Dow Jones Newswires
reported.
	   A notice in Thursday's edition of the daily Herald newspaper
said the government had decided to lease out the operation.
	   The privatization is part of a national economic reform program
adopted in April, the notice said.
	   An International Monetary Fund team that visited here in August
criticized the government's tardiness in selling off its
loss-making businesses.
	   The railway runs 2,592 kilometers (1,620 miles) of track, with
little over 10 percent electrified.

Scene: Serb police escort villagers returning home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RASIC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police Thursday escorted dozens of
ethnic Albanians returning home to a village that was almost
untouched by latest clashes _ a sharp contrast to images of leveled
or burning homesteads in much of the war-torn Serbian province.
	   Having first entered the deserted village of Rasic, 75
kilometers (47 miles) southwest of Pristina, the police convinced
village elders to bring the people back from the woods.
	   Packed on tractors and trailers, Rasic villagers came back to
homes they fled in fear of the latest clashes _ they were promised
peace and quiet on condition no one takes up arms against Serb
forces.
	   Although village buildings bore no dramatic signs of fighting,
houses were peppered with bullet holes and two bodies were found in
a damp, shallow grave under some bushes just out of Rasic.
	   The police dug the bodies up in front of cameras _ one was
allegedly of a Serb prisoner and the other an ethnic Albanian
executed for refusing to be drafted into the Kosovo Liberation
Army.
	   Shown to media was also one KLA fighter captured in Rasic,
wearing a jumpsuit to hide his camouflage uniform beneath,
emblazoned with the KLA insignia.
	   He was led away by the police, his hands tied with a rope.
	   One of the returnees, a Rasic native in his forties, Ismet
Bezeraj, came up and handed over his rifle to the Serb police.
	   ``The UCK gave me this but I did not shoot,'' Bezeraj said,
referring to the Albanian-language acronym for the KLA.
	   He was given a receipt for the weapon.
	   The police, piling confiscated guns on the back of a truck, said
they had found an underground hideaway with a large quantity of
arms in the village.
	   Later same day, Serbian sources reported that as many as ten
thousand ethnic Albanians who had fled the fighting in the Decani
villages in western Kosovo, were returning to their homes.
	   The police were supervising their return and the ethnic
Albanians had agreed to hand over all their arms, reported the
province's Serbian Media Center.

Afghanistan's Taliban says nine missing Iranian diplomats are dead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds; UPDATES with Iranian reaction, Iranian TV claims that Taliban
was responsible, INCORPORATES material from Iran-Afghanistan. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Nine of 11 Iranian diplomats missing
in Afghanistan for a month are dead, the ruling Taliban religious
militia confirmed Thursday. But it denied its fighters were
involved in the deaths.
	   The bodies of the nine were found a month after they vanished
when the Taliban seized the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif from
rival forces on Aug. 8, said a top spokesman for the Taliban
militia.
	   Taliban spokesman Maulvi Wakil Ahmed said the bodies were found
Wednesday in the mountains, according to Afghanistan's ambassador
to Pakistan, Maluvi Saeed-ur-Rehman.
	   There was no word on the fate of two diplomats who remained
missing.
	   ``They are dead and the report has been submitted to (Taliban's
leader) Mullah Omer,'' Rehman quoted the spokesman as saying. He
said Ahmed blamed the killing on opponents determined to provoke
hostile relations between Iran and the Taliban.
	   Iran's state-run television immediately blamed the Taliban for
the deaths, claiming it had evidence that Mullah Omer had
personally ordered his troops to detain the diplomats at the
consulate. The television station did not present any proof.
	   ``Iran reserves the right to respond to this ugly and inhumane
action by any means necessitated by its national security. Iran
recognizes it as its right to punish Taliban,'' said the broadcast.
	   Neither the television commentary nor the Foreign Ministry said
what action Iran would take.
	   Tensions between Iran and the Taliban, who control 90 percent of
Afghanistan, have increased in recent weeks as Tehran demanded the
return of its diplomats.
	   Last week, Iran conducted a massive exercise, with 70,000
troops, warplanes and tanks, on the Afghan border. U.S. and other
experts feared the maneuvers could be a prelude to a military
retaliation. Earlier Thursday, Iran's army chief said new maneuvers
would be held on the Afghan border. He did not say when the new
exercises would start.
	   Shortly after the Taliban announcement, Iran's foreign ministry
demanded the return of the bodies and the arrest of the killers.
	   In a statement, the ministry said the diplomats had been
``martyred in the course of their diplomatic mission,'' and that it
holds the Taliban army and the Pakistani government, which Iran
believes supports the Afghan religious army, responsible for the
deaths.
	   Iran's foreign ministry said the Taliban and Pakistan ``had
assured us of the safety of the consulate and the lives of the
Iranian diplomats.''
	   Last week, the Taliban returned five of at least 50 Iranian
captives in Afghanistan in a goodwill gesture that Iran said at the
time was not good enough. The Taliban has promised a full report on
the fate of the diplomats, and on Thursday vowed to find and arrest
those who killed them.
	   Rehman said the Taliban had offered to return the diplomats'
remains to Iran, which is seeking an apology and the immediate
release of all other Iranian prisoners.
	   But he would not say whether the Taliban would apologize for the
incident, although the BBC television network, citing a
high-ranking Taliban source, on Thursday reported that the group
would not apologize.
	   Ahmed said the incident took place without the Taliban's
knowledge, according to the ambassador.
	   The Taliban blames Iran for backing the opposition northern
alliance which includes the minority Tajik, Uzbek and Hazara ethnic
groups, and Shiite Muslims. Iran, a predominantly Shiite country,
denies the allegation. The Taliban are mostly Pushtuns and follow a
strict Sunni version of Islam.

Saddam wants to increase trade with Egypt, minister says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iraqi President Saddam Hussein wants to
increase trade with Egypt and other Arab countries in an effort to
rally support to have U.N. sanctions lifted, his trade minister
said Thursday.
	   Mohammed Mehdi Saleh said Iraqi import of Egyptian goods under
the oil-for-food deal reached dlrs 231 millions this year.
	   Egyptian exports to Iraq totaled dlrs 20 million when the
oil-for-food program went into effect in December 1996.
	   ``This increase reflects President Saddam Hussein's eagerness to
strengthen and enhance relations between the two countries,'' Saleh
said in a departure statement at Cairo airport.
	   ``The president gives priority to relations with the Arab
countries,'' he added.
	   Iraq plans to further increase its purchases _ mainly medicine,
foodstuff and detergent _ from Egypt to dlrs 250 million by the end
of the year, Saleh said.
	   The U.N. oil-for-food deal allows Iraq to bypass the sanctions
imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait and sell limited
quantities of oil to buy humanitarian goods for its people.
	   But Iraq has been selective in making deals with countries which
have been more sympathetic with its efforts to lift the sanctions.
	   Last month, Iraq asked Egypt to restore diplomatic relations,
saying that recent improvement of ties required a further push.
	   Egypt, which supports the lifting of the sanctions, is reluctant
to restore ties for fear of angering Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
	   Iraq severed diplomatic relation with Egypt and several other
Arab countries in 1991 for their participation in the U.S-led
coalition forces that liberated Kuwait from Iraqi occupation.

Three shepherds, six Islamic militants killed in Algeria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Three shepherds were killed and their
herd of sheep stolen and six Islamic militants have died in the
latest violence in Algeria, newspapers reported Thursday.
	   Armed gunmen attacked the shepherds Tuesday near the town of
Tlyjen about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the border with Tunisia,
the French-language newspaper Liberte reported.
	   One of the shepherds fired back with a hunting rifle and was
then killed. The attackers made off with the shepherds' sheep, the
newspaper said.
	   In a separate incident, Zoheir Souli, a member of the Armed
Islamic Group, which is trying to oust Algeria's military-backed
government, was killed Wednesday in Kouissa-Abdelhak on the
southern edge of the city of Constantine in eastern Algeria,
Liberte said.
	   The newspaper reported that Souli had been wanted by the
Algerian security forces since 1992.
	   Security forces also killed five Islamic militants Tuesday in
the Breira forest about 120 kilometers (75 miles) south of Algiers,
the newspaper said.
	   An estimated 75,000 people, including civilians, Islamic
militants and security forces, have been killed since the start of
an Islamic insurgency in 1992.
	   The violence was triggered by the army's decision to annul
legislative elections to prevent a likely victory by Islamic
fundamentalists.

Moya gains semifinal at U.S. Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with Moya victory. &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB GREENE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Carlos Moya solved the tricky winds in Arthur
Ashe Stadium and the big baseline game of Magnus Larsson Thursday
to win a place in the men's semifinals at the U.S. Open.
	   With his serve never seriously threatened in the surprisingly
quick quarterfinal, the 10th-seeded Spaniard eliminated his Swedish
opponent 6-4, 6-3, 6-3.
	   In Saturday's semifinals, Moya will play the winner of the final
quarterfinal tonight pitting Sweden's Thomas Johansson against
big-serving Mark Philippoussis of Australia.
	   The other semifinal pairing was decided Wednesday when defending
champion Patrick Rafter, the No. 3 seed, defeated No. 12 Jonas
Bjorkman 6-2, 6-3, 7-5 and top-seeded Pete Sampras ousted No. 9
Karol Kucera 6-3, 7-5, 6-4.
	   The women will play their semifinals on Friday when No. 1
Martina Hingis meets No. 3 Jana Novotna and No. 2 Lindsay Davenport
faces No. 5 Venus Williams.
	   Larsson may have been hampered by a bad back. He repeatedly
grabbed his back throughout the match, usually after taking a hard
swing or stretching for a shot, and appeared not to be moving as
easily as he had earlier in the fortnight.
	   But it was Moya's powerful game, not an injury, that ended
Larsson's bid for the year's final Grand Slam tournament title.
With the exception of a few scattered points in the bright
sunshine, it was Moya, quick and nimble around the net and almost
boringly accurate from the baseline, who dictated play.
	   Moya didn't blow Larsson off the court with a huge game. It was
much more subtle, one service break in each set. And when it was
over, Moya had made only 15 unforced errors, compared to 41 by
Larsson.
	   Sampras is going for a record-tying 12th Grand Slam tournament
title. Williams is seeking her first.
	   Both are right on target in this tournament.
	   Sampras and Williams solved the swirling winds Wednesday and
stayed on course with surprisingly easy victories.
	   ``With the conditions, it wasn't fun to play,'' Sampras said.
``Wasn't the best of tennis. I got through it. That's the main
thing.''
	   Williams needed three sets to get past Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario,
who added a hyphen to her last name and a third French Open title
this year. But after dropping the first set, Williams, a finalist
last year in her U.S. Open debut, had no problems winning 2-6, 6-1,
6-1.
	   Davenport gained a semifinal berth by pounding No. 13 Amanda
Coetzer 6-0, 6-4.
	   Sampras gained a measure of revenge against Kucera, who beat the
world's top player in the quarterfinals at this year's Australian
Open.
	   ``I always remember my losses,'' Sampras said. ``He picked me
apart down in Australia. I was probably a little bit more on my
toes tonight than I was in Australia.''
	   Sampras presented too many problems for Kucera. The top seed had
13 aces and had 48 winners, compared to 27 winners for the
Slovakian who eliminated Andre Agassi a day earlier.
	   Two more victories, and Sampras will tie Roy Emerson with 12
Grand Slam tournament singles crowns. He would also match the five
U.S. Open titles won by Jimmy Connors.
	   Rafter, who had 44 winners and only 14 unforced errors, was too
much for Bjorkman, who played in long sleeves on a chilly afternoon
made even colder by a 24 mph (39 kph) wind. Rafter used his
exceptional speed to control the match, running down Bjorkman's
passing shots and darting to the net for winning volleys.
	   Rafter said he was used to playing in the wind, which he said
was like those in Mount Isa, the Australian town where he grew up.
	   ``I've been brought up in the wind, whether it's winter or
summer it's very windy conditions,'' he said. ``I've played in that
since I'm 10 years old.''
	   Williams committed more than half of her unforced errors in the
opening set, which saw Sanchez-Vicario win five of the last six
games, losing only her serve in the fourth game.
	   She found the range after that, powering her groundstrokes deep
into the corners and taking the net at just the right times.
Whenever it appeared Sanchez-Vicario had the upper hand, Williams
would raise her game and win the important points.
	   ``In the first set I was missing a lot, I wasn't patient. I
stayed away from my game plan,'' Williams said. ``I just had to
stop missing. I just had to make up my mind that I wasn't going to
miss anymore.''
	   And she didn't.
	   Davenport also used her power to down Coetzer. Consistent, if
not spectacular, Davenport never lost her serve, despite struggling
with the wind.
	   There were two short rain delays during the Davenport-Coetzer
match.

Leading Iranian dissident denied bail, access to lawyers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Amir-Entezam is correct. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ A former deputy prime
minister, who was Iran's longest-held political prisoner before
being freed in 1996, is being detained without bail or access to
his lawyers, an Iranian newspaper and a human rights group say.
	   Abbas Amir-Entezam was arrested Tuesday, reportedly on
defamation charges, Iran's Akhbar daily said.
	   Amir-Entezam was Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan's deputy when
Bazargan briefly held power after the 1979 Islamic revolution.
	   He was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1979 on charges of
spying for the United States, then released in 1996, without
explanation. Amir-Entezam, who is in his mid-50s, has since been an
outspoken critic of Iran's Islamic government.
	   The paper quoted his wife, Elahe, as saying that Amir-Entezam
was summoned to the court to answer charges of defamation against
Assadollah Lajevardi, a former prosecutor assassinated last month.
	   Following Lajevardi's death in Tehran, Amir-Entezam publicly
condemned prison conditions and the treatment of prisoners during
Lajevardi's tenure as head of Iran's Prisons Organization.
	   The defamation charges were filed by Lajevardi's son,
Amir-Entezam's wife told the newspaper.
	   She said the judge had refused a request for bail, and that
Amir-Entezam was taken to jail after being brought home for a brief
meeting with her. She has not heard from him since, the paper said.
	   Meanwhile, New York-based Human Rights Watch said Amir-Entezam's
wife went to see her husband in jail the next day, but was told
that a suspended life sentence against him had been reinforced.
	   Amir-Entezam, who never received a trial, has vowed to fight on
against Iran's Islamic government until it clears his name.

Ajax and De Boers reach compromise, twins allowed to leave at
</HEADLINE>
season's end &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch soccer powerhouse Ajax
Amsterdam and Frank and Ronald de Boer have reached a compromise in
their contract dispute that will allow the twins to leave the club
at the end of the season, Ajax announced late Thursday.
	   Under a deal that ends a two-month standoff between the club and
its two biggest stars, the De Boers will be allowed to leave from
July 1, 1999.
	   The brothers ``are unconditionally prepared to immediately
resume playing and training for Ajax,'' the club announced. Both
Frank and Ronald de Boer refused to play for the duration of the
dispute.
	   The twins, both key players in the Dutch national team that came
fourth in this summer's World Cup finals, have contracts with Ajax
_ signed just last season _ until 2004 but both are desperate to
leave saying Dutch domestic soccer offers them no new challenges.
	   A Dutch Soccer Association arbitration panel ruled in July that
the brothers had no right to break their contracts.
	   Spanish giant Barcelona, under ex-Ajax coach Louis van Gaal,
reportedly is heading a pack of clubs eager to sign one or both of
the 28-year-old twins.
	   Although Ajax will be disappointed to lose the influential
players at the end of the season, the club will be relieved that
the brothers, left back Frank and right midfielder Ronald, have
agreed to rejoin the reigning Dutch league champion before their
European Champions League campaign starts.
	   In their absence, Ajax has won its first three matches of the
league campaign but lost the season-opening Johan Cruyff Bowl clash
to last season's league runner-up PSV Eindhoven.

Plenty of style for women's semis

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Pick a tennis tactic and it will be on display
Friday in the women's semifinals at the U.S. Open.
	   The power game will be represented by big hitters Venus Williams
and Lindsay Davenport, who figure to slug it out in one pairing.
	   In the other, defending champion Marina Hingis will match her
shotmaking guile against the serve-and-volley game of suddenly
serene Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna.
	   Williams and Davenport are the tallest players on the tour and
love power tennis. Both are bidding for their first Grand Slam
championship, although Davenport reached the semifinals and
Williams the final in New York a year ago.
	   ``Last year was my first semifinal,'' said Davenport, who is
ranked No. 3 in the world and was seeded second in the Open. ``I
was extremely nervous. I didn't play great. I played OK. In the
semifinals, you have to play great.''
	   Since then, Davenport has reached Grand Slam semis at the
Australian and French Opens and lost in the quarters at Wimbledon
to Nathalie Tauziat, a defeat she avenged in the Open.
	   She followed with three straight summer hardcourt tournament
victories, winning two of the finals against Williams and Hingis,
and arrives at the semis at the top of her game.
	   ``I haven't lost a set,'' she said. ``I've been pretty focused
on what I want to do. Winning those three tournaments on a
hardcourt gave me the confidence to come in. Mentally, I feel
great. Physically, I feel pretty good. Hopefully, it will be there
Friday.''
	   Williams, the No. 5 seed, has lost four of five lifetime
meetings against Davenport but displayed gritty tennis in rallying
past Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario in the quarterfinals.
	   She also showed some interest in coming to the net, where her
long arms and legs allow to cover a lot of the court.
	   ``In the past, I didn't have any dedication to coming into the
net,'' she said. ``I had made camp on the baseline. Recently, I
broke camp because I saw that a lot of the shorter players were
serving and volleying. I wondered why I couldn't get myself to the
net.''
	   But she could and she did, winning 16 of 19 points there in last
two sets of her comeback victory over Sanchez-Vicario.
	   Williams, who lost to Hingis in last year's Open finals,
believes she's better prepared now.
	   ``I think I make more intelligent decisions,'' she said. ``I'm
able to really fight out there. I think last year I played well
also. There's nothing more I could have done. There's nothing more
I can do about last year.''
	   Hingis' victory in the finals last year was her third Grand Slam
championship of the season. She followed by winning this year's
Australian Open and losing in the French semifinals to Monica
Seles. At the Wimbledon semis she lost to Novotna, her doubles
partner, who went on to win the title
	   Those losses shook Hingis but she thinks they helped her
refocus.
	   ``Some matches I just would somehow hit the ball but I didn't
know what I was doing,'' she said. ``I just somehow was always too
confident. I went out there and was just going into the match, not
really thinking about what I'm doing out there.''
	   That's changed at the Open.
	   ``I'm a different player again,'' she said.
	   Hingis beat Seles in the Open quarters and now gets a chance to
square things with Novotna in the semis. She remains No. 1 in the
world and a win Friday will keep her there, no matter what happens
in the finals.
	   ``I feel good, so don't take that away from me,'' she said. ``I
think my game has improved a lot. If I really want, I can do well
again.''
	   Novotna has been on cruise control since winning Wimbledon for
her first Grand Slam victory, equipped with confidence in herself
and her game. Seeded No. 3, she knows playing Hingis offers a major
challenge.
	   ``We have big respect for each other,'' she said. ``And I think
that's why we make such a good team when we are playing together
and why we are such great opponents when we play against each other
in singles matches.''
	   They warmed up for their showdown by advancing Thursday to the
finals of women's doubles.

World Cup in Africa holds special meaning for many
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with three leading athletes withdrawing
 &UR; With AP Photos
 &UR; By KATHY CHENAULT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ When Marion Jones arrived this
week on her first visit to Africa, the African-American track star
felt overwhelmed by the chance to compete in a major event on the
continent.
	   ``Just getting my first view of Africa from the plane, I felt
butterflies,'' said Jones, who hopes to stay undefeated this year
in the women's sprints and long jump at the World Cup starting
Friday.
	   ``I just want to listen to the people and watch them. This
experience is very important to me.''
	   Competing in the first premier event in Africa sponsored by the
International Amateur Athletic Federation has special meaning for
many of the athletes in the star-studded field, from Africans
getting the rare chance to be hometown favorites to competitors
like Jones who identify with African heritage.
	   The World Cup brings together athletes from the United States,
Africa, Europe, the Americas, Oceania, Asia, and two European
national squads to compete for team honors in the three-day,
finals-only event.
	   Meanwhile, American hurdler Bryan Bronson, Canadian sprinter
Bruny Surin and French women's sprinter Christine Arron have pulled
out of the competition. Organizers gave no reasons for the
withdrawals.
	   A U.S. team spokesman said Bronson, who holds this year's
fastest time in the 400-meter hurdles, apparently decided not to
run because of fatigue.
	   Surin, who had the fastest time among World Cup entrants in the
men's 100, will not run because of an injury, a Canadian team
official said.
	   For middle-distance ace Maria Mutola of Mozambique, competing in
South Africa means her mother will get to see her run for the first
time. Two busloads of friends from neighboring Mozambique also will
come to Johannesburg to cheer on the 25-year-old Mutola, 1993 world
champion in the women's 800-meter run and Olympic bronze medalist
at the Atlanta Games.
	   ``Competing here will be like a dream for me,'' she said. ``It
is very important for us as African athletes to get this chance to
promote the sport at home.''
	   IAAF President Primo Nebiolo sees the World Cup as a way to
promote track and field on a continent long plagued by hardship and
oppression.
	   ``This is a sign of how much we appreciate South Africa and how
much we want to help South Africa, and with South Africa, Africa,''
he told a news conference Thursday.
	   In a special tribute to Africans, the trophies for the World Cup
champion men's and women's teams have been named after Nelson
Mandela, the onetime political prisoner who became South Africa's
first black president in all-race elections in 1994 that ended
decades of racist rule under the apartheid regime.
	   On Thursday, several World Cup athletes -- including Jones,
men's high jump world record-holder Javier Sotomayer of Cuba and
Kenyan distance ace Daniel Komen -- went to Soweto to attend an
athletics fun day sponsored by the IAAF to promote sports among
children.
	   Nebiolo said the township, long a symbol of racist repression in
South Africa, now can spread a message of hope.
	   ``Soweto is a special place, which touches our conscience as men
and women, rather than sports administrators,'' he said.
	   But Africa's gain in getting to stage the World Cup in
Johannesburg has been Asia's loss. Nebiolo has come under fire
because the World Cup schedule conflicts with the Commonwealth
Games in Kuala Lumpur. Many stars have opted for the World Cup,
which is offering dlrs 3.5 million in individual prize money and
dlrs 100,000 for a world record.
	   Nebiolo rejected the criticism, saying the World Cup was
scheduled first and that Commonwealth organizers were advised to
pick another time for their event so it wouldn't be obscured by the
competition in South Africa.
	   ``There is a priority (for the IAAF) because track and field is
controlled by us, not by the Commonwealth Games,'' he said.
	   Nebiolo called the scheduling ``a grave mistake made by the
Commonwealth Games.''

Nationalist parties draw big crowd in rival's stronghold

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A flag-waving, chanting
crowd that filled the central square Thursday night cheered Bosnian
Serb nationalist leaders in a show of strength before weekend
elections.
	   The crowd, estimated at well over 15,000 people, was far larger
and louder than the numbers that attended an election rally at the
same square Tuesday for moderate Bosnian Serb leader Biljana
Plavsic and her coalition partners.
	   If the rallies reflect Bosnian Serb sentiments in the voting
Saturday and Sunday, it could mean a serious setback for efforts by
the international community to bring down the nationalist leaders
who share the blame for starting Bosnia's 1992-95 war.
	   Banja Luka, in northwest Bosnia, has been the stronghold of more
moderate Bosnian Serb leaders. The nationalist parties were
expected to get more support in the eastern half of the Bosnian
Serb republic rather than in Banja Luka and the rest of the western
half.
	   Momcilo Krajisnik, the Bosnian Serb representative on the
three-man presidency shared with a Bosnian Croat and Muslim,
portrayed the election as a battle to preserve the autonomy of the
Bosnian Serb republic.
	   It is one of two ethnic-based entities created in Bosnia under
the 1995 Dayton peace treaty that ended the war. The other is a
Muslim-Croat federation, and voters only pick leaders for the
entity in which they are registered.
	   To Krajisnik's Serbian Democratic Party and its Serbian Radical
Party allies, the Bosnian Serb republic is an independent entity in
Bosnia with stronger ties to Yugoslavia than the Muslim-Croat
federation. They insist Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic wants to
make Bosnia a single state with a Muslim majority, which they say
differs from the Dayton agreement's concept of separate entities.
	   ``You have this historic chance to save the country,'' bellowed
Krajisnik, who has been blamed by international officials for
obstructing efforts to implement the Dayton accords. ``We want to
have good relations with our former enemies who are now our
partners, but we don't want to give up'' the Bosnian Serb republic.
	   Fears of clashes between nationalist and moderate supporters
proved unfounded. The only trouble was a tear gas canister thrown
in the front of the crowd by an unknown assailant, causing people
to scatter with hands over their mouths. No one was injured.
	   Voters will elect the three-member presidency, along with a
national parliament and separate parliaments in the Bosnian Serb
republic and the Muslim-Croat federation. In the Bosnian Serb
republic, voters also will choose a new president.
	   It is the second national election since the war ended, but the
previous government with Krajisnik, Izetbegovic and Bosnian Croat
Kresimir Zubak in the three-member presidency has failed to agree
on most policy issues due to lingering hatred and mistrust from the
war.
	   To overcome the impasse, Carlos Westendorp, the European envoy
overseeing Bosnia, has been given what amounts to absolute power to
force decisions on the leaders.
	   The international community has openly opposed Krajisnik,
calling him a foe of the Dayton agreement.

Ross says he finds Israel, Palestinians ready to make progress
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. Recasts, UPDATES with comment on Clinton crisis and peace
process, start of Ross-Erekat meeting, statement from prime
minister's office &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An American mediator held a round of talks
Thursday aimed at reviving the peace process, but Israel was
tight-lipped about any progress and Palestinians said bridging gaps
would be difficult.
	   Meanwhile, the unfolding crisis in Washington led some to wonder
aloud whether prospects for reviving the Mideast peace process
would suffer as a result of President Clinton's mounting troubles.
	   ``The uncertainty ... creates a situation of instability,''
former Palestinian Cabinet minister Hanan Ashrawi told CNN.
``Instead of making clear policy decisions ... everyone's
second-guessing what will happen to Clinton.''
	   Although Israeli officials publicly voiced confidence in the
Clinton administration's continuing peace efforts, commentators
were more pessimistic.
	   ``I think in a situation without an actively involved U.S.
president, the chances for a major crisis next year are
considerably increasing,'' said Ehud Yaari, a leading Israeli
commentator on Palestinian affairs.
	   Details of the U.S. independent counsel's report on Clinton _
which sources in Washington said presents evidence aimed at showing
perjury, obstruction of justice, witness tampering and abuse of
power _ dominated Israeli news reports on Thursday. Coverage of the
visit of Dennis Ross, the U.S. mediator, was a distant second.
	   Ross, whose visit is expected to last at least several more
days, held separate talks in Jerusalem with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and with top Palestinian officials.
	   Netanyahu's office issued a terse statement afterward that made
no reference to any progress.
	   ``Israel still expects full reciprocity from the Palestinians,''
the statement said, without elaborating.
	   Ross himself was cautious about forecasting any breakthrough.
	   ``I'm seeing whether or not it's possible to narrow the
differences,'' Ross told reporters after briefing Israeli President
Ezer Weizman.
	   Weizman, who is known for bluntness, was asked whether he was
more optimistic after hearing from Ross. ``No,'' he said.
	   Later, the American envoy met for 3 1/2 hours with Arafat deputy
Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, and Palestinian parliament
speaker Ahmed Qureia, also known as Abu Ala.
	   ``I hope we will reach _ it is very difficult _ a conclusion,''
Abbas said. ``We hope to bridge the differences, but we are still
at the beginning.''
	   Afterward, Ross headed into a separate evening session with
senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat.
	   Outside the Jerusalem hotel where the talks took place, small
groups of opposing demonstrators faced off. Protesting the envoy's
visit were about 30 right-wing activists, who carried signs reading
``Ross Bug Off'' and ``No more land to Arafat.''
	   About a dozen counter-demonstrators from the group Peace Now
waved signs saying ``Save the peace process.''
	   Ross is accompanied by Jonathan Schwartz, a U.S. State
Department legal adviser who drafted the 1997 agreement on an
Israeli withdrawal from most of the West Bank town of Hebron.
	   The Haaretz daily said Thursday that Ross hoped to get something
on paper by the weekend. However, sources close to the negotiations
said there was no indication that the two sides had reached the
stage of writing a draft.
	   On the table is a U.S. proposal for an Israeli withdrawal from
13 percent of the West Bank and detailed provisions for Palestinian
cooperation with Israel and the United States on security.
	   Israel initially rejected a 13 percent pullback, but then said
it would agree, provided that 3 percent of that area is declared a
nature reserve in which Israel retains security control and the
Palestinians are not be allowed to build.
	   The Palestinians have said they accepted temporary restrictions,
but wanted assurances that the area eventually come under full
Palestinian control.
	   The most difficult issue facing Ross is Israel's demand to
renegotiate an agreement on security cooperation.
	   A blueprint for Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation and a
Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants was worked out by
Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. security officials last December, but
was rejected by Netanyahu as insufficient.
	   The Palestinians initially said they would not agree to changes,
but in recent days have softened their position.

Sudanese president demands American apology for bombing factory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Gen. Omar Hassan El-Bashir, the president of Sudan,
demanded that the United States apologize for an air strike on a
Sudanese factory that allegedly made chemical weapons.
	   ``We demand that the United States apologize or send a
commission of inquiry to verify that the destroyed factory did not
produce chemical weapons as they (U.S.) claims,'' the Sudanese
leader said at a news conference marking the end of a three-day
visit to Morocco.
	   The Aug. 20 cruise missile strikes targeted a Sudanese factory
which the United States claims made ingredients for chemical
weapons and Islamic extremist training camps in Afghanistan.
	   The strikes where a reprisal for the Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S.
embassies in Nairobi and Tanzania which the United States blames on
Osama bin Laden, a millionaire thought to be at the center of a
vast terrorist network.
	   Sudan has in the past given refuge to bin Laden, a Saudi Arabian
who is now based in Afghanistan. El-Bashir said the factory had
never belonged to bin Laden.
	   ``We have lost a factory but won world sympathy. Even with
investment of hundreds of millions of dollars, we could not have
had this result,'' said the Sudanese leader.
	   El-Bashir also said that Sudan would continue to oppose the
United States and represented a bulwark against American influence
in the Arab and Islamic world.

Keiko the Hollywood whale goes home to cheers of children
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEIMAEY, Iceland (AP) _ ``Free Willy'' star Keiko the killer
whale played out his homecoming scene in true Hollywood style
Thursday, cheered by hundreds of excited children who lined the
streets of this tiny town on a windswept archipelago.
	   As he slipped into the Icelandic waters, thrashed his tail and
began to explore his new home, Keiko carried with him the hopes of
thousands of friends and fans who want him to leave the
professional life behind.
	   And in a plot twist, Keiko struck up a ``conversation'' with a
nearby porpoise within two hours of being placed back in his native
waters. His ecstatic handlers called it a sign that the former
movie star is ready to assume a new role as a creature of the wild.
	   ``Keiko and the dolphin are actively vocalizing with one
another,'' said Bob Ratliffe, executive director of the Free Willy
Keiko Foundation. ``We couldn't have dreamed this would happen so
soon.''
	   In this starkly beautiful Icelandic outpost where Keiko was
born, the cameras rolled and the press snapped pictures, but most
important was the sweetest sound a star can hear __ the cheers and
applause of adoring fans as Keiko's holding tank was driven through
town from the airport to the sea.
	   Children ran alongside the truck and clusters of youngsters
waved ``Velkommen Keiko,'' banners and little Icelandic and
American flags.
	   ``It is real exciting,'' said 10-year-old Frans Friorikson, who
turned out in his knitted hat with a stuffed Keiko sewn to the top.
``Keiko is so good for Iceland.''
	   As happy as Frans is to welcome Keiko, the children of Oregon
were sad to see him go. Hundreds of kids, some with signs reading
``Keiko, we love you'' and ``We will miss you,'' lined the highway
as the whale was transported to the airport.
	   Orcas are almost commonplace in this part of the world, but
Keiko is not just any orca.
	   He had made a lot of friends during his recuperation at an
aquarium in Newport, Oregon, after some misadventures in Mexico.
And he had many thousands of young fans from his appearance in the
1993 movie ``Free Willy.''
	   After he arrived in a holding tank aboard a U.S. Air Force C-17
cargo plane after an eight-hour flight, his custom-built container
was loaded onto a truck for the trip through Heimaey.
	   From there, it was onto a barge and a brief sail under crystal
blue skies, past spectacular 800-foot-high (245-meter) volcanic
cliffs to a sea pen the size of a football field, where Keiko will
try to adapt to his old environment.
	   Though experts agree it will take two years before it can be
determined if he'll survive in the open ocean, first indications
were that it was a happy repatriation.
	   ``We are on the verge of the dream coming true,'' said Dr. Lanny
Cornell, Keiko's lead veterinarian. ``Keiko made the trip in
unbelievably good fashion.''
	   When he was lowered into the water, like any weary traveler
after a long flight, Keiko seemed stiff at first. But he picked up
the pace and swam strongly around his new surroundings, diving and
resurfacing while four divers who have been his friends for years
waited and watched anxiously.
	   As he swam past, one diver called out to another, ``He looks
real strong!''
	   Keiko left these waters at age 2. He is about 21 now, and will
live in his pen until his handlers determine he is able to live on
his own. He already has had lessons in hunting for his own food.
	   It was an emotional moment for members of the Free Willy Keiko
Foundation staffers, whose dream was to set him free, just as in
the ``Free Willy'' movie that made him a star.
	   In the box-office hit, about an orca threatened by a villainous
amusement park owner, the whale played by Keiko leaps over a
breakwall to freedom in the open ocean.
	   After he was found in a Mexican aquarium, school kids collected
pennies to help save him Warner Bros. and cell-phone billionaire
Craig McCaw kicked in millions more to send the whale to an Oregon
tank to recuperate from lung infections and warty lesions, all with
the aim of setting him free.
	   McCaw, who traveled to Iceland for Keiko's release, said that
after seeing the movie he decided that children needed to be shown
that ``dreams do come true.''
	   ``I made up my mind that he needed to go free, and that we
needed to keep our philosophical promise to children,'' McCaw said.
	   Since trying to transform a long-captive whale back into a wild
predator has never been tried before, the effort has been
criticized by those who say Keiko isn't skilled enough at catching
fish, has no experience of other orcas and could be shocked by the
frigid, harsh conditions of the North Atlantic.
	   Brad Andrews, vice president of zoological operations for the
Sea World theme parks, where orcas perform tricks for audiences,
scoffed at assertions by Keiko's handlers that he is already happy
and conversing with other marine life.
	   ``Whoever is telling you that is anthromorphic,'' or pretending
to converse with animals, Andrews said. ``This is just another step
in the fantasy. I hope it doesn't affect him.''

	   MOSTAR, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ To ensure a peaceful election
this weekend, police are cracking down on Bosnian Serb, Croat and
Muslim crime bosses in hopes of reducing their grip on political
and economic power in southern Bosnia.
	   ``We have increased police activities in the light of the coming
elections,'' said Sefkija Dziho, deputy interior minister of the
Mostar region. ``But after the elections, we plan to increase our
activities further.''
	   Dziho gave few other details because the month-long operation is
ongoing. But the crackdown, code-named ``Elections 98,'' has
already resulted in several arrests, confiscation of weapons,
drugs, vehicles and destruction of two marijuana plantations.
	   Southern Bosnia is considered a key route for drug trafficking,
weapons smuggling and transporting vehicles stolen from across
Europe.
	   In the past, many international and local officials considered
Mostar the center of the illegal network. Many criminals grew more
powerful during the 1992-1995 Bosnian war by controlling black
markets.
	   But in Mostar and elsewhere, such groups have prevented
implementation of the 1995 Dayton peace accord by blocking the
return of refugees from rival ethnic groups and seeking to prevent
law and order to preserve their power.
	   Arrests of several key figures over the past year have calmed
the situation somewhat, officials say, and recent coordinated
actions by police and customs authorities have broken several
smuggling networks.
	   ``This is a good progress,'' said Martin Garrod, a deputy to
Bosnia's top international mediator, Carlos Westendorp. Garrod is
in charge of peace implementation in southern Bosnia.
	   ``In fact if you wake up at night it's more likely to be dogs
barking than anything else,'' he said, referring to nighttime
explosions which used to be a feature of Mostar life.
	   The operation has forced some of the country's leading crime
bosses to reassess their activities. Dziho said that from Aug.
18-21, Bosnian Serb, Croat and Muslim mafia bosses held a
clandestine conference in Mostar to discuss ways to combat police
and set up new smuggling routes.
	   Dziho said the next step for police will be to investigate ties
between criminals and politicians. For this to succeed, Dziho and
international officials are hoping voters will select politicians
during the Saturday and Sunday national election to build an
independent, honest judiciary.
	   Officials cite several cases where suspects were released by the
courts despite strong evidence against them.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran on Thursday vowed to punish
Afghanistan's Taliban militia for the deaths of nine of its
diplomats, Iranian television reported.
	   The Iranian Foreign Ministry said Iran held the Taliban and
Pakistan responsible for the deaths, adding that it ``reserved the
right to defend its people against aggression.''
	   It demanded the immediate repatriation of the diplomats' bodies
and the release of all Iranians held in Afghanistan.
	   Iran's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared three
days of mourning starting Saturday for ``the martyrdom of the
innocent Iranian diplomats by the Taliban,'' said Iranian
television, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation.

Spaniard wins leg and jersey in Tour of Spain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   XORRET DE CATI, Spain (AP) - Jose Maria Jimenez of Spain won the
sixth leg and the leader's jersey in the Tour of Spain on Thursday
as he cruised to victory nearly a minute ahead of the pack.
	   The Banesto racer became the first Spaniard to win a stage in
this year's three-week cycling marathon in Spain.
	   Riding 201.5 kilometers (126 miles) from Murcia to Xorret de
Cati, he finished in a time of 5 hours, 17 minutes, 57 seconds.
	   Second place went to fellow Spaniard Roberto Heras of the
Kelme-Costa Blanca team, and third to Laurent Jalabert of France
and ONCE-Deutsche Bank.
	   Those three riders hold the same positions in the overall
standings.
	   Thursday's leg got off to a slower than expected start because
of a steep mountain pass at the end of the trek. None of the riders
had covered it before, and were thus saving their energy.
	   Jimenez broke away during the climb and never looked back,
finishing 47 seconds ahead of the pack. Speaking of his double
victory, Jimenez said: ``I get goosebumps just thinking of it.''
	   Friday's seventh leg is a 186-kilometer (116-mile) stretch
between Alicante and Valencia.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ First Manchester United, now Arsenal.
	   One day after United's board accepted a record dlrs 1 billion
takeover bid from Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB television, Arsenal said
it was considering a possible buyout by another TV company.
	   In a joint statement, Arsenal and Carlton Communications said
they were holding ``very preliminary discussions'' on ways of
working together.
	   ``These talks are too preliminary in nature to assess the
probability of any outcome,'' the statement said. ``One possible
outcome could be an offer being made by Carlton for Arsenal.''
	   The London Evening Standard said the talks involved a possible
275-million-pound (dlrs 459.2 million) takeover.
	   A third club, Aston Villa confirmed late Thursday that it was
also holding talks with a media company, reportedly Carlton, about
a possible take-over.
	   Aston Villa financial director Mark Ansell said the
Birmingham-based club was negotiating with a ``communications
firm'' but would not release any further details.
	   ``There is a chance that a deal might be wrapped up in the same
way as with Manchester United,'' he said Thursday.''
	   The announcements came a day after the board of Manchester
United accepted a 623-million-pound (dlrs 1 billion) bid from
BSkyB, the highest amount ever paid for a sports franchise.
	   The Manchester United takeover, which still needs approval by
the club's shareholders and government regulators, sparked
speculation of the possibility of a series of takeovers of soccer
teams by media companies.
	   ``After yesterday's Manchester United deal, the big clubs are
realizing it is better to pick your partner and be one of the first
in, rather than hang around,'' said William Davies, a soccer
analyst with London stockbroker Albert E. Sharp.
	   While some Manchester United fans have vowed to fight the
proposed Murdoch takeover, there was a sense of inevitability among
Arsenal fans gathered outside the club's Highbury stadium Thursday
in north London.
	   ``I suppose now that Manchester United have done it, we have to
as well,'' teenage student Lynette Dowden said. ``But it's all
about money these days. It's not the football that matters any
more.''
	   Shelley Johnson, a 21-year-old student teacher, concurred.
	   ``I don't particularly like it, but if Manchester United get all
the money from Sky they might run away with everything. We've got
to compete somehow.''
	   Along with Manchester United and Liverpool, Arsenal is one of
the clubs which could take part in a proposed European Super League
starting in 2000.
	   A lucrative takeover could help the club finance a new stadium
to replace Highbury, which has a capacity of just 38,000 and is
considered too small to meet current demand.
	   The current Arsenal team is coached by Frenchman Arsene Wenger
and features a lineup of international stars including Dutch
striker Dennis Bergkamp and French World Cup winners Patrick Vieira
and Emmanuel Petit.
	   Wenger said Thursday he was unaware of the talks with Carlton
but understood if fans were worried about the prospect of their
club being run by a media company.
	   ``Their concern is that the people who own their club should
also love it,'' he said. ``They don't want it to just become a
business. It is the history of football in England that club owners
are in the game for things other than business reasons, but the
game is changing all the time of course.''
	   Wenger warned that smaller clubs could be left out if England's
elite teams are bought up by the media.
	   ``The worry is that the rules of the game could change if four
or five clubs have owners from the media,'' he said. ``They would
have the power to make life really impossible for the other
teams.''
	   The Gunners played a 0-0 tie with London rival Chelsea on
Wednesday night. They travel to Leicester on Saturday and open
their European Champions League campaign next week against French
side Lens.
	   Arsenal is listed on the Ofex stock exchange, smaller and more
informal than the principal London stock market.
	   On Wednesday, the club was valued at 162.4 million pounds (dlrs
271 million). After the announcement of the talks with Carlton,
shares soared Thursday and the club was revalued at 224 million
pounds (dlrs 374 million).
	   There are 56,000 shares in Arsenal. The club is run by chairman
Peter Hill-Wood and vice chairman David Dein.
	   Carlton Communications owns the Carlton Television company in
London and the Midland's Central Television and Westcountry
Television.
	   The group is a major seller of advertising airtime on TV and
cinema, and a 50 percent partner with Granada Group in ON Digital,
the digital TV consortium.
	   While Carlton is smaller than Murdoch's media empire, it has the
television franchise for London as well as a number of others
across Britain.
	   Financial experts now expect Liverpool, Newcastle and possibly
Chelsea to be the next clubs sought after by media companies.
	   Granada, which owns TV franchises in both the Liverpool and
Newcastle area, is considered a potential bidder.

<TEXT>
	   ISTINIC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Their tractors parked
bumper-to-bumper, about 25,000 refugees _ lacking food, clean water
and hope _ camped Thursday in fields, terrified that Serb police
soon would be arresting men suspected of membership in the rebel
army.
	   Serb forces appeared to have halted their advance, which drove
ethnic Albanians from their homes and farms into a huge encampment
around this village 45 miles (70 kms) southwest of the provincial
capital, Pristina.
	   Carloads of armed Serb police, some escorting Western diplomatic
observers, cruised back and forth on the road past the refugees,
provoking curses as well as instilling fear. Parked tractors
stretched for more than a mile from the center of the village,
hooked to trailers piled high with hurriedly gathered clothes and
belongings.
	   ``Police beat six young guys right here an hour ago with
sticks,'' said a middle-aged man who was standing on a dirt road
through the camp. Fearing for his safety, he asked that his name
not be published.
	   On the horizon, black smoke rose slowly from Albanian villages
abandoned since the Serbs launched their pincer attack Tuesday.
Hundreds of police and soldiers, backed by armored vehicles and
trucks hauling heavy artillery, patrolled nearby.
	   Until this week's attacks, the Istinic area was one of the last
strongholds of the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for
independence from Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Rrok Berisha, a member of Kosovo's unauthorized ethnic Albanian
parliament, said most of the refugees fled 40 nearby villages
shelled by police in the past few days.
	   Berisha, who has been trapped in Istinic for three days, said he
feared 100,000 refugees could stream into the area as more villages
are cleared. Kosovo's population is 90 percent ethnic Albanian,
most of whom back the rebels.
	   Refugees said they feared police soon would begin rounding up
men of fighting age on suspicion they had fought with the KLA. A
village elder said about 40 men and women injured by shelling fled
into the hills Wednesday, fearing arrest.
	   Those who stayed behind faced a desperate situation. In one
house, a 16-year-old boy lay on the floor, screaming in pain, with
a bag taped to his bullet-shattered abdomen to collect excrement.
	   Family members said he was shot when he tried to return to their
home with a friend to feed their cattle. His mother said the boys
stumbled on police looting their home. Police opened fire, wounding
her son and probably killing his 18-year-old friend, the mother
said.
	   Outside in the fields, a young woman carrying an infant who had
blood streaming from his head ran and screamed for medical help, of
which there was none. The baby was kicked by a horse in the jammed
refugee convoy, she said.
	   A village official said five people, including a baby and a
toddler, died on Wednesday alone for lack of medical treatment.
Refugees and village officials said there was not enough clean
water and food to prevent death and disease.
	   A half-dozen shots rang out Thursday afternoon, out of earshot
of the main cluster of refugees. A policeman, who did not give his
name, explained his colleagues simply were shooting cows to roast
for dinner.
	   Kosovo fighting already has created an estimated 265,000
refugees. Western officials fear the worst if urgent help isn't
provided for the 50,000 or so living in the hills and forests,
especially with the arrival of winter in about six weeks.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton released dlrs 20 million in aid for
Kosovo refugees on Wednesday. The White House said the money, plus
an earlier dlrs 11 million U.S. contribution, would go to U.N. and
private agencies providing food and shelter for refugees.
	   The United Nations estimated this week that 600 to 700 civilians
have been killed in six months of fighting between Serb-led forces
and Kosovo Albanian rebels.
	   While world leaders have condemned Serbian actions, the Serbs
also accuse rebels of massacring Serb civilians.
	   Western officials have threatened military intervention for
months if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic doesn't halt the
offensive. But such plans have been stymied, in large part because
of opposition from Russia and its new prime minister-designate,
Yevgeny Primakov.
	   As foreign minister, Primakov refused to support any U.N.
Security Council resolution to authorize use of force in Kosovo.
Without U.N. approval, many European NATO members are reluctant to
take part.
	   In Athens, Greece, meanwhile, the Yugoslav foreign minister
claimed the Kosovo Liberation Army no longer controls any territory
in Kosovo.
	   During a meeting with his Greek counterpart, Zivadin Jovanovic
said the group no longer has any leadership.
	   The Yugoslav minister also alleged 60,000 of the Kosovo
residents who had fled the fighting in the province have now
returned home.

 &UR; New drug shows promise of fighting depression &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURAN NEERGAARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ An experimental drug appears to alleviate
depression by blocking a mysterious brain chemical _ one that until
now, doctors didn't even know was at work in mental disorders.
	   The finding by Merck and Co., published in Friday's edition of
the journal Science, could give doctors the first entirely new way
to treat depression in decades, offering hope to patients who get
no help from today's therapies such as Paxil and Prozac.
	   ``This is really very important,'' said Dr. Steven Hyman,
director of the government's National Institute on Mental Health,
who is familiar with the findings. ``To everybody's surprise, it
(the new drug) was robustly effective for depression.''
	   The drug still needs more extensive testing in humans, however,
before it would be eligible to receive government approval to be
sold.
	   Depression is America's most prevalent mental health problem,
afflicting about 15 million people at some point in their lives.
Americans spend about dlrs 3 billion a year on drugs to battle it.
Those drugs do help many patients.
	   But they also can cause serious side effects. Also, some 20
percent of patients get no help from today's medicines, which all
target either serotonin or norepinephrine, brain chemicals called
neurotransmitters, Hyman said. So scientists have long hunted
another way to attack depression.
	   Merck says its new drug, code-named MK-869, may do just that, by
targeting a brain chemical called substance P that until now has
been a mystery.
	   In a study of 213 patients with moderate to severe depression,
Merck tested MK-869 against Paxil, a popular and effective
antidepressant, or against a placebo. During the six-week study,
MK-869 relieved depression as effectively as Paxil did, but with
fewer side effects, Merck lead researcher Dr. Mark Kramer reported
in Science.
	   Just how MK-869 worked inside these patients' brains remains a
mystery that has doctors intrigued.
	   Substance P is a neuropeptide, a small protein that helps nerve
cells communicate. It was discovered in 1931, and doctors theorized
it might offer a way of treating chronic pain when they learned it
played some role in alerting nerve cells to tissue damage. Instead,
``it's been a disappointment,'' Hyman said _ the chronic pain
research has failed.
	   Merck scientists theorized that substance P was playing a role
in ``emotional pain,'' based on how animals put in stressful
situations to mimic human psychological stress reacted to higher or
lower levels of the neuropeptide.
	   Merck designed a chemical that blocks substance P. In animal
testing, company scientists proved that blocking substance P did
not affect the function of serotonin or norepinephrine, the two
brain chemicals that today's antidepressants target. Clearly, it
was relieving psychological symptoms in an entirely new way, so
they moved to testing MK-869 in people.
	   Based on standard psychological test scores, the experimental
drug helped significantly improve depression in about half of
patients tested, about the same number that Paxil helped.
	   MK-869 appeared to have fewer side effects. Some 29 percent of
Paxil patients reported sexual dysfunction, a common antidepressant
side effect, vs. just 3 percent of MK-869 patients. MK-869 patients
also reported slightly less nausea than did Paxil patients.
	   Why would it work? Scientists don't quite know, but a hint is
that the part of the brain behind the ears that's important in
regulating negative emotions ``is literally packed with substance P
receptors,'' the government's Hyman said.

Lesotho elections report confirms irregularities, South African
</HEADLINE>
officials says &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A new report on alleged election
fraud in Lesotho confirms a previous finding that the tiny mountain
kingdom's electoral commission mishandled the vote, a South African
official said Thursday.
	   South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe are trying to mediate a
solution to ongoing political protests from opposition parties who
claim the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy rigged the
landslide win in May.
	   South Africa's Deputy President Thabo Mbeki on Wednesday
hand-carried a report written by the tri-country Langa Commission
to Lesotho's capital, Maseru, on Wednesday.
	   Mbeki's top aide, Frank Chikane, said the report contained no
surprises and called for a political solution to the crisis.
	   But he refused to give details of the report, and said its
release would be discussed by the presidents of the three countries
at a summit in Mauritius that starts Sunday.
	   The summit is to include presidents of the 14 countries that
belong to the Southern African Development Community chaired by
South African President Nelson Mandela.

Spaniard wins leg and jersey in Tour of Spain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   XORRET DE CATI, Spain (AP) - Jose Maria Jimenez of Spain won the
sixth leg and the leader's jersey in the Tour of Spain on Thursday
as he cruised to victory nearly a minute ahead of the pack.
	   The Banesto racer became the first Spaniard to win a stage in
this year's three-week cycling marathon in Spain.
	   Riding 201.5 kilometers (126 miles) from Murcia to Xorret de
Cati, he finished in 5 hours, 17 minutes, 57 seconds.
	   Second place went to fellow Spaniard Roberto Heras of the
Kelme-Costa Blanca team, and third to Laurent Jalabert of France
and ONCE-Deutsche Bank.
	   Those three riders hold the same positions in the overall
standings.
	   Thursday's leg got off to a slower than expected start because
of a steep mountain pass at the end of the trek. None of the riders
had covered it before, and were thus saving their energy.
	   Jimenez broke away during the climb and never looked back,
finishing 47 seconds ahead of the pack. Speaking of his double
victory, Jimenez said: ``I get goosebumps just thinking of it.''
	   Friday's seventh leg is a 186-kilometer (116-mile) stretch
between Alicante and Valencia.

Minister names fired official as deputy head of state TV
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The head of a popular TV channel who sued
the government for firing her for inaccurate reporting, was named
Thursday as deputy chief of the state-run television, a newspaper
reported.
	   Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif, whose ministry overseas
television and radio broadcasting, fired Malak Ismael as head of
state-run Channel 1 in July after the television station made two
false reporting in June.
	   It erroneously reported the death of a popular actor and a few
days later reported disturbances in a Cairo low income neighborhood
which the government denied.
	   Ismael sued the information minister, saying she was not
responsible for handling the television's news department which is
supervised by the head of the department.
	   Al-Gomhuria, a government newspaper, reported in its early
Friday edition that el_Sherif named Ismael as deputy head of the
television, a job which gives her more responsibility overseeing
Egypt's all eight channels. It said Ismael, a veteran television
broadcaster, is still demanding financial compensation for the two
months she spent without work. It did not say how much money she is
demanding.
	   Channel 1, one of the most popular in Egypt, reported on June 17
that Farid Shawqi, a famous film and theater actor, had died after
surgery. His family protested. Shawqi dies a month later.

Security Council reiterates demand for cease-fire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. chief and the Security Council
both urged the Yugoslav leader to stop the crackdown on ethnic
Albanians in the separatist Kosovo province and warned that a
humanitarian catastrophe was imminent _ although a lack of
consensus on the council continues to frustrate any action.
	   In a letter to Slobodon Milosevic dated Sept. 1 but released
Thursday, Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged the Yugoslav president
to make good on a pledge to withdraw special troops from Kosovo,
where ethnic Albanians are fighting for independence from Serb
forces.
	   In his letter, Annan noted that the ``disproportionate use of
force by Serbian police and military units has led to loss of life,
mass displacement of the civilian population, and destruction of
property and means of livelihood.''
	   He blamed Milosevic for obstructing humanitarian assistance to
refugees _ an estimated quarter of a million people facing winter
with little or no food or shelter.
	   Annan's letter was released as the council was briefed on the
situation by a representative of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees.
	   The United Nations estimates that more than 265,000 people have
fled their homes since Milosevic launched a crackdown Feb. 28
against the militant Kosovo Liberation Army, which wants
independence from Serbia, the dominant republic in what is left of
Yugoslavia. Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs in the province
nine-to-one.
	   The council president, Hans Dahlgren of Sweden, read a statement
after the briefing calling on Milosevic to ``order a halt to all
repressive actions against the civilian population.''
	   He pledged that the 15 members would take further action,
acknowledging frustration that the council had done little to try
to stop the crisis.
	   ``There is a view among council members that there is a need to
return to this rather urgently,'' Dahlgren said after the council
was briefed on the situation. ``But there is, as everyone knows,
disagreement on what practical steps there could be consensus on in
the council.''
	   The council expressed its ``grave concern at the severe
humanitarian consequences for the civilian population caused by the
fighting and violations of international humanitarian law and human
rights,'' he said in the statement.
	   Milosevic has promised humanitarian workers access to the
displaced in Kosovo.
	   ``Despite your assurances of international access, however, I
have been informed of repeated instances in which insecurity
resulting from fighting has prevented or delayed the delivery of
aid,'' Annan said in his letter.
	   ``On occasion, the fault has lain with Kosovo Albanian units.
But it is clear that responsibility for obstructing humanitarian
access lies overwhelmingly with Serbian forces,'' it said.
	   Annan has received no response from Milosevic, U.N. spokesman
Fred Eckhard said.
	   In his letter, Annan said last month's killing of three Mother
Theresa relief workers ``who seem to have been deliberately
targeted by Serbian police, was one particularly appalling example
of the unacceptable and excessive use of force.''

DreamWorks to begin filming on St. John
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ Film crews from
Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks Pictures studio are scheduled to
begin filming a romantic comedy called ``Forces of Nature'' on St.
John Friday.
	   Manny Centeno, who heads the territory's Film Promotion Board,
said the crews were expected to film at Trunk Bay and Hawksnest Bay
over the weekend.
	   Centeno could not say whether Spielberg himself would be
present.
	   While the territory does not charge any special fees for filming
on the islands, Centeno said the presence of the crews during the
down season for tourism helps local hotels and vendors stay afloat.
In addition, the free publicity that comes from having the islands
pictured or mentioned is worth millions in advertising dollars, he
said.

Ajax and De Boer twins reach compromise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch soccer powerhouse Ajax
Amsterdam and Frank and Ronald de Boer have reached a compromise in
their contract dispute that will allow the twins to leave the club
at the end of the season, Ajax announced late Thursday.
	   Under a deal that ends a two-month standoff between the club and
its two biggest stars, the De Boers will be allowed to leave after
July 1, 1999.
	   The brothers ``are unconditionally prepared to immediately
resume playing and training for Ajax,'' the club announced. Both
Frank and Ronald de Boer refused to play for the duration of the
dispute.
	   The twins are both key players in the Dutch national team that
came fourth in this summer's World Cup finals. They have contracts
with Ajax _ signed just last season _ until 2004 but both are
desperate to leave, saying Dutch domestic soccer offers them no new
challenges.
	   A Dutch Soccer Association arbitration panel ruled in July that
the brothers had no right to break their contracts.
	   Spanish giant Barcelona, under ex-Ajax coach Louis van Gaal,
reportedly is heading a pack of clubs eager to sign one or both of
the 28-year-old twins.
	   Although Ajax will be disappointed to lose the influential
players at the end of the season, the club will be relieved that
the brothers, left back Frank and right midfielder Ronald, have
agreed to rejoin the reigning Dutch league champion before their
European Champions League campaign starts.
	   In their absence, Ajax has won its first three matches of the
league campaign but lost the season-opening Johan Cruyff Bowl to
last season's league runner-up PSV Eindhoven.

UN willing to participate in investigation of missing Iranian
</HEADLINE>
diplomats &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations is considering
participating in a mission to investigate an announcementt Thursday
that Iranian diplomats who were abducted in northern Afghanistan
have been killed, a spokesman said.
	   The United Nations was planning to look into the kidnappings in
any case and ``today's news, if confirmed, would not change that,''
said spokesman Fred Eckhard. U.N. officials are conferring about a
possible mission with Iran and Pakistan.
	   Eleven Iranian diplomats vanished from Mazar-e-Sharif after the
Taliban religious militia seized the northern city from rival
forces on Aug. 8. The Taliban said Thursday that nine of the 11
were found dead Wednesday but denied responsibility for the
killings.
	   There was no word on the fate of two other diplomats.
	   Iran has blamed the Taliban for the deaths and has recently
stepped up military activities on the Afghan border in what U.S.
and other experts have said could be a prelude to a military
retaliation.
	   Last week, Iran conducted a massive exercise, with 70,000
troops, warplanes and tanks, on the Afghan border. Earlier
Thursday, Iran's army chief said new maneuvers would be held on the
Afghan border. He did not say when the new exercises would start.
	   The Taliban militia has vowed to respond to any Iranian military
strike.
	   Asked how they would respond, a spokesman for the religious
movement, Noorullah Zadran, said, ``The same way we did to the
Russians,'' referring to the failed Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
	   Zadran was speaking Thursday at a panel on Afghanistan at
Columbia University in New York.
	   The Taliban blames Iran for backing the opposition northern
alliance which includes the minority Tajik, Uzbek and Hazara ethnic
groups, and Shiite Muslims. Iran, a predominantly Shiite country,
denies the allegation. The Taliban are mostly Pushtuns and follow a
strict Sunni version of Islam.

	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A flag-waving, chanting
crowd that filled the central square Thursday night cheered Bosnian
Serb nationalist leaders in a show of strength before weekend
elections.
	   The crowd, estimated at well over 15,000 people, was far larger
and louder than the numbers that attended an election rally at the
same square Tuesday for moderate Bosnian Serb leader Biljana
Plavsic and her coalition partners.
	   If the rallies reflect Bosnian Serb sentiments in the voting
Saturday and Sunday, it could mean a serious setback for efforts by
the international community to bring down the nationalist leaders
who share the blame for starting Bosnia's 1992-95 war.
	   Banja Luka, in northwest Bosnia, has been the stronghold of more
moderate Bosnian Serb leaders. The nationalist parties were
expected to get more support in the eastern half of the Bosnian
Serb republic rather than in Banja Luka and the rest of the western
half.
	   The Bosnian Serb republic is one of two ethnic-based entities
created in Bosnia under the 1995 Dayton peace treaty, which ended
the war. The other is a Muslim-Croat federation, and voters only
pick leaders for the entity in which they are registered.
	   To the more nationalist Bosnian Serb parties, the Bosnian Serb
republic is an independent entity in Bosnia with stronger ties to
Yugoslavia than the Muslim-Croat federation. They insist Muslim
leader Alija Izetbegovic wants to make Bosnia a single state with a
Muslim majority, which they say differs from the Dayton agreement's
concept of separate entities.
	   Fears of clashes between nationalist and moderate supporters
proved unfounded. The only trouble was a tear gas canister thrown
in the front of the crowd by an unknown assailant, causing people
to scatter with hands over their mouths. No one was injured.
	   Voters will elect the three-member presidency, along with a
national parliament and separate parliaments in the Bosnian Serb
republic and the Muslim-Croat federation. In the Bosnian Serb
republic, voters also will choose a new president.
	   It is the second national election since the war ended, but the
previous government headed by Izetbegovic has failed to agree on
most policy issues due to lingering hatred and mistrust from the
war.

	   Release of the 445-page Starr report on President Bill Clinton
is not expected until Friday. We will advise you of anything more
definitive.
	   Because of the volume, perhaps as much as 150,000 words, and the
danger of overloading computer systems, we will be unable to
transmit the complete text on World Service wires.
	   However, we will provide a full text of the report at Internet
ftp sites. You will be advised of the sites' usernames and
passwords after we have obtained the files.
	   On World Service circuits, we plan to transmit all or most of
report's introduction (estimated at up to 7,500 words) and then
excerpts of the entire report.

Caribbean nations join plans for investment fund amid market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Two more Caribbean nations signed on
to plans for a regional investment fund this week, even as currency
devaluations and market volatility around the world make some
question the timing.
	   Caricom, as the Caribbean Community trading organization is
known, has been planning to create the Caribbean Investment Fund
for eight years in hopes of raising dlrs 50 million U.S. to
refinance small and medium-sized businesses and stimulate economic
growth.
	   Jamaica and Guyana, the site of Caricom headquarters, both
signed agreements this week committing their countries to
participating in the fund. Five countries had previously signed up.
	   Meanwhile, Caricom officials said they are considering whether
to widen participation to include the 24 founding members of the
Association of Caribbean States, including Cuba. If that is done,
the name would be changed to the Caribbean Basin Investment Fund.
	   But regardless of what it is called or who participates, some
economists question the timing, as stock markets have tumbled from
Asia to Russia to neighboring Latin America.
	   ``We hope it is not too bad a time to venture out to the market
at the moment,'' said Guyana Budget Director Winston Jordan. ``It
could well be a bad time.''
	   The fund is already registered in the Bahamas, which plans to
sign a participation agreement later this month. The fund would be
administered by the ICWI Group in Jamaica.
	   ICWI chief Dennis Lalor said that although the goal is to raise
dlrs 50 million, up to dlrs 4 billion could be raised.

U.S. envoy, in latest peace bid, says he hopes to narrow gaps
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Ross-Erekat meeting over, no statement, minor
editing &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An American mediator held a round of talks
Thursday aimed at setting terms for an Israeli pullback from the
West Bak, but Israel was tight-lipped about any progress and
Palestinians said bridging gaps would be difficult.
	   Meanwhile, the unfolding crisis in Washington led some to wonder
aloud whether prospects for reviving the Mideast peace process
would suffer as a result of President Clinton's mounting troubles.
	   ``The uncertainty ... creates a situation of instability,''
former Palestinian Cabinet minister Hanan Ashrawi told CNN.
``Instead of making clear policy decisions ... everyone's
second-guessing what will happen to Clinton.''
	   Although Israeli officials publicly voiced confidence in the
Clinton administration's continuing peace efforts, commentators
were more pessimistic.
	   ``I think in a situation without an actively involved U.S.
president, the chances for a major crisis next year are
considerably increasing,'' said Ehud Yaari, a leading Israeli
commentator on Palestinian affairs.
	   Details of the U.S. independent counsel's report on Clinton
dominated Israeli news reports on Thursday, with coverage of the
visit of U.S. mediator Dennis Ross running a distant second.
	   Ross, whose visit is expected to last at least several more
days, held separate talks in Jerusalem with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and with top Palestinian officials.
	   Netanyahu's office issued a terse statement afterward that made
no reference to any progress.
	   ``Israel still expects full reciprocity from the Palestinians,''
the statement said, without elaborating.
	   Ross himself was cautious about forecasting any breakthrough.
	   ``I'm seeing whether or not it's possible to narrow the
differences,'' he told reporters, adding there were indications the
two sides had ``the desire to try to find ways'' to do that.
	   But Israeli President Ezer Weizman, was characteristically blunt
when asked after a Ross briefing whether he was optimistic based on
what he'd heard. ``No,'' he said.
	   Later, the American envoy met for 3 1/2 hours with Arafat deputy
Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, and Palestinian parliament
speaker Ahmed Qureia, also known as Abu Ala.
	   Abbas said afterward there was some room for encouragement, but
that reaching any accord would be ``very difficult.''
	   ``We hope to bridge the differences, but we are still at the
beginning,'' he said.
	   Afterward, Ross headed into a separate evening session with
senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat. After an hourlong talk,
he left without speaking to reporters.
	   Radio and television reports on earlier meetings, meanwhile,
said the Israeli side was disappointed that Ross had not yet gotten
detailed responses on Palestinian security responsibilities, and
that Arafat told Ross the Palestinians were being unfairly blamed
for the impasse.
	   Outside the Jerusalem hotel where the talks took place, small
groups of opposing demonstrators faced off. Protesting the envoy's
visit were about 30 right-wing activists, who carried signs reading
``Ross Bug Off'' and ``No more land to Arafat.''
	   About a dozen counter-demonstrators from the group Peace Now
waved signs saying ``Save the peace process.''
	   The Haaretz daily said Thursday that Ross _ who is accompanied
by a State Department legal adviser who drafted an earlier
withdrawal agreement - hoped to get some draft accord on paper by
the weekend. However, sources close to the negotiations said there
was no indication that the two sides had reached the stage of
writing a draft.
	   On the table is a U.S. proposal for an Israeli withdrawal from
13 percent of the West Bank and detailed provisions for Palestinian
cooperation with Israel and the United States on security.
	   Israel initially rejected a 13 percent pullback, but then said
it would agree, provided that 3 percent of that area is declared a
nature reserve in which Israel retains security control and the
Palestinians are not be allowed to build.
	   The Palestinians have said they accepted temporary restrictions,
but wanted assurances that the area eventually come under full
Palestinian control.
	   Also to be dealt with is Israel's demand to renegotiate an
agreement on Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation.
	   A blueprint for that was worked out by Israeli, Palestinian and
U.S. security officials last December, but was rejected by
Netanyahu as insufficient. The Palestinians initially said they
would not agree to changes, but in recent days have softened their
position.

Monaco downs ten-man Lens with Trezeguet double
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ David Trezeguet scored his first goals of the
season Thursday as Monaco beat ten-man Lens 2-0 in a first division
match that paired the two most recent French champions.
	   World Cup star Trezeguet scored his first in the 61st minute
during a long spell of pressure from 1997 champion Monaco.
	   Ludovic Guily, who had just come on as a substitute crossed from
the right, and Trezeguet headed past Lens goalkeeper Guillaume
Warmuz from six meters (yards).
	   Ten minutes later Trezeguet scored a near-identical goal, rising
to head in a cross from Willy Sagnol.
	   Lens, the current French champion, struggled after its striker
Pascal Nouma was shown the red card in the 24th minute for a
knee-high tackle on Muhamed Konjic.
	   The win moves unbeaten Monaco into second place.
	   In the other match played Thursday, newly-promoted Lorient drew
1-1 at home to Auxerre.
	   Pascal Camadini scored for the Britanny team in the second
minute, diverting a deflected shot into the net from eight meters
(yards).
	   Auxerre's French international Bernard Diomede struck the
crossbar with a 20 meter (yard) shot in the 44th minute but the
visitors didn't have to wait much longer for the equalizer, Gerald
Baticle, left unmarked in front of goal, knocking in a fine left
wing cross from Stephane Carnot seconds before halftime.
	   In Friday's matches, leaders Bordeaux hosts Montpellier, while
Rennes travels to third-placed Marseille.

Afghanistan's Taliban says nine missing Iranian diplomats are dead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Iran declaring mourning period for dead
diplomats; Stands as 3rd-Ld Writethru to some lines. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Nine of 11 Iranian diplomats missing
in Afghanistan for a month are dead, the ruling Taliban religious
militia confirmed Thursday. But it denied its fighters were
involved in the deaths.
	   The bodies of the nine were found a month after they vanished
when the Taliban seized the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif from
rival forces on Aug. 8, said a top spokesman for the Taliban
militia.
	   Taliban spokesman Maulvi Wakil Ahmed said the bodies were found
Wednesday in the mountains, according to Afghanistan's ambassador
to Pakistan, Maluvi Saeed-ur-Rehman.
	   There was no word on the fate of two diplomats who remained
missing.
	   ``They are dead and the report has been submitted to (Taliban's
leader) Mullah Omer,'' Rehman quoted the spokesman as saying. He
said Ahmed blamed the killing on opponents determined to provoke
hostile relations between Iran and the Taliban.
	   Iran immediately blamed the Taliban and their ally, Pakistan,
for the deaths. State-run television claimed it had evidence that
Mullah Omer had personally ordered his troops to detain the
diplomats at the consulate. The television station did not present
any proof.
	   Iran's Foreign Ministry said it ``reserved the right to defend
its people against aggression.'' It demanded the immediate
repatriation of the diplomats' bodies and the release of all
Iranians held in Afghanistan.
	   Neither the television commentary nor the Foreign Ministry said
what action Iran would take.
	   Iran's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared three
days of mourning starting Saturday for ``the martyrdom of the
innocent Iranian diplomats by the Taliban,'' said Iranian
television, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation.
	   Tensions between Iran and the Taliban, who control 90 percent of
Afghanistan, have increased in recent weeks as Tehran demanded the
return of its diplomats.
	   Last week, Iran conducted a massive exercise, with 70,000
troops, warplanes and tanks, on the Afghan border. U.S. and other
experts feared the maneuvers could be a prelude to a military
retaliation. Earlier Thursday, Iran's army chief said new maneuvers
would be held on the Afghan border. He did not say when the new
exercises would start.
	   In a statement, Iran's Foreign Ministry said the diplomats had
been ``martyred in the course of their diplomatic mission,'' and
that it holds the Taliban army and the Pakistani government, which
Iran believes supports the Afghan religious army, responsible for
the deaths.
	   The ministry said the Taliban and Pakistan ``had assured us of
the safety of the consulate and the lives of the Iranian
diplomats.''
	   Last week, the Taliban returned five of at least 50 Iranian
captives in Afghanistan in a goodwill gesture that Iran said at the
time was not good enough. The Taliban has promised a full report on
the fate of the diplomats, and on Thursday vowed to find and arrest
those who killed them.
	   Rehman said the Taliban had offered to return the diplomats'
remains to Iran, which is seeking an apology and the immediate
release of all other Iranian prisoners.
	   But he would not say whether the Taliban would apologize for the
incident, although the BBC television network, citing a
high-ranking Taliban source, on Thursday reported that the group
would not apologize.
	   Ahmed said the incident took place without the Taliban's
knowledge, according to the ambassador.
	   The Taliban blames Iran for backing the opposition northern
alliance which includes the minority Tajik, Uzbek and Hazara ethnic
groups, and Shiite Muslims. Iran, a predominantly Shiite country,
denies the allegation. The Taliban are mostly Pushtuns and follow a
strict Sunni version of Islam.

Trevor Rees-Jones sues Al Fayed to recover legal costs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Billionaire Mohamed Al Fayed is refusing to pay
some legal costs incurred by the sole survivor of the Paris crash
that killed Princess Diana and his son, Dodi, his spokesman said
Thursday.
	   Laurie Mayer said Fayed questions the amount of bodyguard Trevor
Rees-Jones' 27,000-pound (dlrs 43,000) legal costs and ``whether
they are reasonable and proper.''
	   Rees-Jones, who was employed as a bodyguard for Fayed, has filed
a summons in county court to recover the money. He claims Fayed
broke a promise to pay his lawyers' fees related to the French
investigation into the Aug. 31, 1997 crash, which also killed the
car's driver, Henri Paul.
	   Mayer said Fayed paid Rees-Jones' legal costs until he left the
Harrods owner's employ in April. Rees-Jones now works as a
part-time sales assistant in a sports shop in Oswestry, in central
England.
	   ``At the time when Rees-Jones ceased to be employed, the French
lawyers said they did not think it appropriate that Mr. Al Fayed
should continue to pay any further legal fees,'' Mayer said.
	   A county court hearing on Rees-Jones' lawsuit is scheduled for
Oct. 22.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks plunged Thursday, with the Dow
industrials down 345 points before recovering nearly 100 in the
frenzied final minutes of trading.
	   The selloff extended Wednesday's losses, more than wiping out
all of Tuesday's record Dow gain, as fresh worries about
impeachment added to Wall Street's uneasiness over a growing global
economic crisis and its impact on U.S. corporate profits.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, up a record 380.53 points
Tuesday then down 155.76 on Wednesday, was down 345.52 during the
final half hour of trading. While it bounced back sharply in the
closing minutes, it still ended the day down 249.48, a drop of 3.2
percent, at 7,615.54.
	   With its sixth-biggest point drop ever, the Dow now is 3.7
percent below where it began the year and 18.4 percent beneath the
record 9,337.97 reached on July 17. Thursday's percent decline was
not close to a record.
	   Shares plunged in Latin America.
	   Stocks also skidded lower in Europe, with the major index
finishing down 5.8 percent in Germany, a major trading partner of
beleaguered Russia. Russian President Boris Yeltsin assured German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl by phone Thursday that his new choice for
prime minister would stick to market reforms if confirmed, the
German government said.
	   Shares closed down 3.3 percent in London, Europe's largest
market, and were off 4.6 percent in Paris.
	   In the U.S., in the rush out of stocks, there was a surge in the
market for U.S. Treasury bonds _ a traditional haven for cash in
times of unrest. Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds, which move in
the opposite direction of prices, fell to 5.18 percent.

	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ Ever more reliant
on revenue from rum exports, the U.S. Virgin Islands hopes a new
dlrs 9 million pier for receiving molasses will boost production of
the liquor.
	   Donald Nelthropp, president of V.I. Rum Industries, which
produces Cruzan Rum, predicted the pier would increase molasses
imports, from which rum is made, and thereby boost exports.
	   Rum exports have taken on increased importance as the
cash-strapped territory recently floated dlrs 541 million in bonds
secured by the islands' share of the federal excise taxes on rum.
	   Of the dlrs 13.50 per gallon federal tax on rum, dlrs 11.30 is
returned to the territory. That share was raised from dlrs 10.50 by
the U.S. Congress, but that authorization expires Sept. 30.
	   U.S.V.I. officials are trying to get Congress to continue the
higher level of rebates, but even at the lower level the taxes will
be enough to meet the debt service on the half-billion-dollar bond
issue, officials said.
	   The territory needs increased revenues to meet a variety of
debts.
	   It owes more than dlrs 172 million in long overdue salary
increases to workers and dlrs 60 million in refunds to taxpayers
and payments to vendors.
	   The new pier is capable of providing berths for two large
vessels simultaneously.

U.S. envoy, in latest peace bid, says he hopes to narrow gaps
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Ross-Erekat meeting over, no statement, comment
on Clinton crisis and peace process, start of Ross-Erekat meeting,
statement from prime minister's office. &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An American mediator held a round of talks
Thursday aimed at setting terms for an Israeli pullback from the
West Bank, but Israel was tight-lipped about any progress and
Palestinians said bridging gaps would be difficult.
	   Meanwhile, the unfolding crisis in Washington fueled concerns
that prospects for reviving the Mideast peace process would suffer
as a result of U.S. President Bill Clinton's mounting troubles.
	   ``The uncertainty ... creates a situation of instability,''
former Palestinian Cabinet minister Hanan Ashrawi told CNN.
``Instead of making clear policy decisions ... everyone's
second-guessing what will happen to Clinton.''
	   Although Israeli officials publicly voiced confidence in the
continuing American peace efforts, commentators were more
pessimistic.
	   ``I think in a situation without an actively involved U.S.
president, the chances for a major crisis next year are
considerably increasing,'' said Ehud Yaari, a leading Israeli
commentator.
	   Details of the U.S. independent counsel's report on Clinton
dominated Israeli news reports on Thursday, with coverage of the
visit of U.S. mediator Dennis Ross running a distant second.
	   Ross, whose visit is expected to last at least several more
days, held separate talks in Jerusalem with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and with top Palestinian officials.
	   Netanyahu's office issued a terse statement afterward that made
no reference to any progress.
	   ``Israel still expects full reciprocity from the Palestinians,''
the statement said, without elaborating.
	   Ross himself was cautious about forecasting any breakthrough.
	   ``I'm seeing whether or not it's possible to narrow the
differences,'' he told reporters, adding there were indications the
two sides had ``the desire to try to find ways'' to do that.
	   But Israeli President Ezer Weizman was characteristically blunt
when asked after a Ross briefing whether he was optimistic. ``No,''
he said.
	   Later, the American envoy met for 3 1/2 hours with Arafat deputy
Mahmoud Abbas and Palestinian parliament speaker Ahmed Qureia.
	   Abbas said afterward there was some room for encouragement, but
that reaching any accord would be ``very difficult.''
	   ``We hope to bridge the differences, but we are still at the
beginning,'' he said.
	   Afterward, Ross headed into a separate evening session with
senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat. After an hour-long talk,
he left without speaking to reporters.
	   Radio and television reports on earlier meetings, meanwhile,
said the Israeli side was disappointed that Ross had not yet gotten
detailed responses on Palestinian security responsibilities, and
that Arafat told Ross the Palestinians were being unfairly blamed
for the impasse.
	   Outside the Jerusalem hotel where the talks took place, small
groups of opposing demonstrators faced off. Protesting the envoy's
visit were about 30 right-wing activists, who carried signs reading
``Ross Bug Off'' and ``No more land to Arafat.''
	   About a dozen counter-demonstrators from the group Peace Now
waved signs saying ``Save the peace process.''
	   The Haaretz daily said Thursday that Ross _ who is accompanied
by a State Department legal adviser who drafted an earlier
withdrawal agreement _ hoped to get some draft accord on paper by
the weekend. However, sources close to the negotiations said there
was no indication that the two sides had reached the stage of
writing a draft.
	   On the table is a U.S. proposal for an Israeli withdrawal from
13 percent of the West Bank and detailed provisions for Palestinian
cooperation with Israel and the United States on security.
	   Israel initially rejected a 13 percent pullback, but then said
it would agree, provided that 3 percent of that area is declared a
nature reserve in which Israel retains security control and the
Palestinians are not be allowed to build.
	   The Palestinians have said they accepted temporary restrictions,
but wanted assurances that the area eventually come under full
Palestinian control.
	   Also to be dealt with is Israel's demand to renegotiate an
agreement on Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation.
	   A blueprint for that was worked out by Israeli, Palestinian and
U.S. security officials last December, but was rejected by
Netanyahu as insufficient. The Palestinians initially said they
would not agree to changes, but in recent days have softened their
position.

Generals from former Angolan rebel group break with leader Savimbi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ In an apparent break with their leader,
eight army generals from the former rebel group UNITA on Thursday
urged the movement's troops to stop attacking government positions
and surrender their weapons.
	   ``We call on all ... former UNITA fighters to stop making war
and lay down their arms,'' UNITA Gen. Demostenes Chilingutila said
in a statement read in the capital Luanda.
	   The government, which signed a peace pact with UNITA in 1994 to
end their two-decade civil war, has accused the movement's leader
Jonas Savimbi and some of his troops of being behind recent attacks
on rural villages.
	   The attacks reportedly have killed more than 100 civilians and
police and have jeopardized the outstanding provisions of the
United Nations-brokered peace accord.
	   ``A war would no longer be to defend anyone. It would not be
justifiable,'' Chiligutila said, flanked by seven other UNITA
generals.
	   Among them was Gen. Arlindo Chenda Pena, known as Gen. Ben-Ben,
who is Savimbi's nephew and who led UNITA's army during the civil
war.
	   The eight generals had joined the country's combined armed
forces as part of the peace deal and are living in Luanda.
	   Savimbi has refused to leave his central highland stronghold in
Andulo, 480 kilometers (300 miles) southeast of Luanda, and has not
been seen in public for years.
	   The generals' announcement was the latest sign that Savimbi's
support within UNITA, which he has led since creating the group
more than 30 years ago, is crumbling.
	   Senior UNITA officials in Luanda last week said they would no
longer follow Savimbi.
	   The dissidents, including former senior UNITA spokesman Jorge
Valentim and Eugenio Manuvakola, the group's former
secretary-general, accused Savimbi of not wanting peace.
	   The U.N. Security Council has imposed sanctions on UNITA, a
Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, for its failure to comply with the peace
accord.

Wedding Fair shows support for non-Orthodox and civil marriages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo TLV103M
 &UR; By DANIEL BEN-TAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ About 300 people turned out for a
``wedding fair'' staged as a symbolic show of support for
non-Orthodox or civil marriages, which are not legally recognized
if performed in Israel.
	   Israel's Orthodox religious establishment has a monopoly on
marriage, a sore point with many secular Jews.
	   At the fair, held in a Tel Aviv square, about 20 exhibit stalls
exhibited wares ranging from handwritten wedding contracts to
package tours to Cyprus, where many secular Israelis go to wed.
	   Even though non-Orthodox weddings held in Israel are not legally
recognized, Reform Jewish weddings this year doubled from the
previous year, reaching nearly 1,000, said Rabbi David Ariel-Joel,
the associate director of the Israel Movement for Progressive
Judaism.
	   One Tel Aviv couple, Galit Lisser and Nir Asulin, used the fair
as an occasion to get married, even though their ceremony won't be
legally recognized. A samba band played, people danced, and
onlookers drank colored cocktails in test tubes.
	   The couple's marriage ceremony was originally to be performed by
Tel Aviv Mayor Roni Milo, a champion of secular freedoms. Milo,
however, bowed to political pressure Wednesday and decided not to
preside, saying that his participation would be divisive.
	   Maya Brunitski-Zohar, 26, an events promoter, who married her
husband a year ago in a Reform ceremony followed up by a civil
marriage in Cyprus, said they considered the religious ceremony in
Israel ``our real wedding'' even though it was not legally
recognized.
	   Many who attended the wedding fair voiced outrage that Jewish
couples must travel abroad to have non-Orthodox or civil ceremonies
officially recognized in Israel.
	   ``If a Jewish couple is married in a church abroad, the marrige
is recognized by the state, but if I marry a couple in Israel it is
not (recognized). This is absurd,'' said Ariel-Joel.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Thursday's play &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Call it the Sister Slam. Mixed doubles at this
year's Grand Slam tournaments turned into a sweep for Serena and
Venus Williams.
	   Serena and Max Mirnyi of Belarus completed set Thursday at the
U.S. Open, beating 1996 champions Lisa Raymond and Patrick
Galbraith 6-2, 6-2.
	   Williams and Mirnyi, who also won the Wimbledon final this year,
split the first prize of dlrs 120,000.
	   ``I'm taking the check and he gets the trophy,'' Serena Williams
said.
	   Venus Williams and Justin Gimelstob won the Australian and
French Opens, but lost in the quarterfinals at the U.S. Open.
	   Martina Hingis, meanwhile, remained on target for a Grand Slam
sweep in women's doubles.
	   She and Jana Novotna beat Raymond and Rennae Stubbs to advance
to Sunday's final against Natasha Zvereva and Lindsay Davenport.
	   Hingis and Novotna _ who will meet in the women's semifinals
Friday _ won the French Open and Wimbledon titles this year after
Hingis teamed with Mirjana Lucic to win the Australian Open crown.
	   --- &QC; 
	    &UR; OVERSHADOWED OPEN: &LR;  While the U.S. Open remains in the
spotlight of worldwide sports, it's been overshadowed by other
events in its home country and home town.
	   Most prominent has been Mark McGwire's pursuit of the home-run
record, culminating in his 62nd homer Wednesday night. That was the
eighth home run the St. Louis slugger hit since the Open started
Aug. 31, and explosion of baseball power helped to reduce newspaper
space and broadcast airtime for tennis. Virtually every top player,
baseball fan or not, has been asked about McGwire's feats.
	   Closer to the National Tennis Center, sports fans have focused
on the city's two baseball teams, with the Yankees getting 100 wins
and clinching the American League East, and the Mets chasing the
National League wild-card spot with Shea Stadium only a couple
hundred yards away.
	   And the NFL opened on the middle Sunday of the tournament with
the two local teams involved in tight contests _ the Giants
rallying to beat Washington, the Jets losing to San Francisco in
overtime on a 96-yard run by Garrison Hearst.
	   The tennis has been high quality, with stars such as Pete
Sampras, Venus Williams and Martina Hingis through to the
semifinals. But fans who braved a blustery day Thursday or tuned in
at home saw two decidedly non-marquee men's quarterfinals _ Carlos
Moya beating Magnus Larsson 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 in the afternoon,
unseeded Thomas Johansson and Mark Philippoussis meeting at night.
	   The glamour returns Friday with the women's semifinals, Hingis
playing Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna and Williams playing
Olympic champion Lindsay Davenport.
	   --- &QC; 
	    &UR; WHAT A DIFFERENCE 30 YEARS MAKE: &LR;  Thirty years of Open play
makes a big difference in the money prizes.
	   At the first U.S. Open in 1968, the total prize money was dlrs
100,000, with the men's champion scheduled to receive dlrs 14,000.
	   Although Arthur Ashe won the first title, he was still an
amateur. Tom Okker, the losing finalist, received the money.
	   Ashe collected dlrs 280 _ 14 days of per diems.
	   The women's champion, Virginia Wade, received dlrs 6,000.
	   This year, the singles winners get dlrs 700,000 each out of the
total prize money of dlrs 14 million. Losing quarterfinalists even
get dlrs 100,000.
	   In 1970, Margaret Smith Court won the women's singles and also
was part of the winning doubles and mixed doubles teams. She
received dlrs 9,500 in all.

Study: Lowering diabetics' blood sugar could save thousands yearly
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Embargoed until 2300 GMT; time set by source. &QL; 
 &UR; By EMMA ROSS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Scientists have shown that reducing the blood
sugar and blood pressure of most diabetics to close to normal
levels dramatically lowers the risk of life-threatening
complications such as kidney damage or strokes.
	   The findings by Oxford University researchers, outlined Friday
in two British medical publications, could save thousands of lives
a year worldwide, researchers say.
	   Conventional treatment for those with Type II, or adult-onset
diabetes, which accounts for 90 percent of the 140 million cases
worldwide, already involves lowering blood glucose and blood
pressure through diet and exercise, drugs or insulin.
	   Doctors generally have not considered it important to attack
high blood sugar as aggressively as the new findings recommend
because there was little evidence it would prevent complications.
	   But a 20-year study of the treatment and management of Type II
diabetes, outlined in the Lancet and the British Medical Journal,
shows that the closer blood sugar and blood pressure is to normal,
the better off the patient is.
	   The study involving 5,100 patients is the largest ever
undertaken in the field of diabetes.
	   Richard Kahn, chief scientific and medical officer of the
American Diabetes Association, which was not connected with the
research, called the findings ``extremely definitive'' and ``one of
the two landmark studies ever conducted in diabetes.''
	   The other watershed study was conducted by scientists in the
United States in 1993. It reached similar conclusions about the
link between controlling blood sugar and blood pressure and the
risk of complications of the small blood vessels in those who have
Type I diabetes, which occurs in childhood or early adulthood.
	   Most of the complications in adult-onset diabetes involve the
large arteries, and it had not been known whether more intensive
therapy would be helpful, particularly when concern exists about
whether insulin could harm arteries in the long term.
	   The study found no evidence that insulin caused disease in the
arteries.
	   In the Oxford University study, patients were enrolled as soon
as they were diagnosed with diabetes and followed for an average of
10 years. Blood sugar and pressure levels were monitored more
frequently than usual and treatment dosages increased if levels
rose.
	   The researchers found that better blood glucose control using
existing methods reduced the risk of eye disease by a quarter and
kidney damage by a third, compared with common levels of treatment.
	   They also found that reducing blood pressure in those who have
elevated levels, about 40 percent of patients, cut the risk of
strokes, failing sight and death by diabetes-related ailments by a
third.
	   Doctors have largely accepted that blindness, stroke, kidney
failure, heart attacks and leg amputations are a natural
progression of the disease, said Dr. Robert Turner, a professor of
medicine at Oxford who led the study.
	   Dr. Peter Watkins, who also was involved in the study, said
while lowering blood pressure is relatively easy, reducing blood
sugar to near-normal levels is more challenging and would involve
patients going to the doctor more often, being more strict with
their diets and their exercise regimes, and taking more pills.
	   Insulin also might have to be introduced at an earlier stage to
achieve the best results, he said.
	   Most people have a blood sugar level of 72 milligrams to 144
milligrams per deciliter (4 to 8 millimoles per liter), but it is
quite common for diabetics to have a blood sugar level of 180
milligrams to 360 milligrams per deciliter (10 to 20 millimoles per
liter), Watkins said.
	   He said the study suggests diabetics should aim for a level
before eating breakfast of 108 milligrams per deciliter (6
millimoles per liter). Blood pressure should be lower than 150 over
85, he said.

	   DHAKA , Bangladesh (AP) _ Nearly 600,000 Bangladeshis fearfully
searched for higher ground Thursday as rising floodwaters
threatened to destroy a 22-mile (35 kms) earthen dike protecting
the capital.
	   Monsoon rains that began in July have caused the worst flooding
in a decade in this South Asian nation the size of Wisconsin.
Floods have submerged much of the country, claiming more than 850
lives and displacing more than a quarter of Bangladesh's 124
million people.
	   The flooding also has increased the spread of waterborne
diseases and destroyed an estimated 2.3 million tons of rice.
	   For the first time in weeks, Bangladesh reported a slight dip in
water levels Thursday in its upstream rivers. But water continued
to rise downstream, threatening the capital of 9 million people,
Dhaka.
	   Soldiers, civil engineers and thousands of residents dumped sand
bags and rocks to shore up the 22-mile (35-kms) embankment on the
southeastern outskirts of the city. Volunteers riding motorcycles
and using cell phones patrolled the embankment to alert rescue
workers about leaks.
	   ``This is a battle we must win,'' said Mohammad Shafique, a
college student who joined 20,000 people working round-the-clock to
plug leaks and prevent the water from overflowing.
	   Others kept constant vigil so they could evacuate quickly should
the embankment collapse.
	   The Brahmaputra and Jamuna Rivers fell by 9 (23 cms) and 7.5
inches (19 cms) respectively in areas north of Dhaka, the Flood
Forecast and Warning Center said. But water rolling south into the
Bay of Bengal aggravated flooding in the capital and surrounding
central regions.
	   The Buriganga River, a tributary of the Brahmaputra River,
swelled by 5 inches (13 cms) Thursday.
	   Momtaz Ahmed hesitated Thursday to take his family to one of the
crowded, disease-ridden refugee camps that have sprouted up.
	   ``I am trying to leave the area with my family any time today
for a safer place, which I have not been able to find yet,'' Ahmed
said.
	   Dozens of boats were at the ready and at least 10 buildings had
been selected for use as emergency shelters for women, children and
the elderly in Dhaka and two adjoining towns.
	   The Water Development Board said if the dike collapses, up to 8
feet (2.5 meters) of water will deluge the area. However, it added
that should take at least eight hours to reach that height, giving
people time to evacuate.
	   Most embassies in the capital are located in the Baridhara and
Gulshan neighborhoods, which are already waist-deep in water,
forcing most diplomats to ride boats to work.
	   The United Nations, appealing to the world to help Bangladesh
cope with the floods, noted that the emergency shelters were
severely overcrowded.
	   ``This overcrowding combined with shortages of food, safe
drinking water and adequate safe sanitation facilities are the
almost perfect breeding ground for a major disease outbreak and
public health crisis,'' the U.N. said.
	   The government has asked for dlrs 889 million in foreign aid and
has so far received pledges totaling dlrs 172 million.

	   TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) _ Flood victims in Chiapas state cried
out for food and clean water Thursday, desperate for the arrival of
aid flights that were blocked by heavy rain and poor visibility.
	   ``The children are crying because they haven't brought anything
to eat,'' one man angrily told a military officer at the Tapachula
Country Club, where 250 people sought shelter.
	   The officer, identified only as S. Camacho, said relief efforts
were being hurt by a shortage of gasoline and diesel.
	   ``If the secretary of defense doesn't bring us food, we're going
to eat rocks,'' Camacho said.
	   The flooding, said to be the region's worst in 50 years, has
knocked out bridges and roads to dozens of communities along the
Pacific coast. The condition of some areas was an ominous mystery
because even radio contact had lost.
	   At least 40 people have been confirmed dead in flooding across
the country over the past week.
	   A Chiapas state spokesman said 26 deaths were confirmed and at
least 60 people were missing. The dead included a police officer
who drowned during a rescue operation in Pijijiapan; five other
officers were missing.
	   A radio operator in Nueva Francia, about 40 miles (65 kms) north
of Tapachula, reported Thursday that a river had washed away about
20 homes with families inside _ but communication was lost and it
remained one of many unconfirmed rumors sweeping the state.
	   Neither federal or Chiapas state authorities had yet delivered
aid to Pijijiapan, a city north of Tapachula where 18 people had
died, Mayor Gilberto de los Santos said Thursday.
	   State civil protection director Romeo Leon Vidal said rescuers
had been unable to reach many areas.
	   ``It's a very grave situation,'' President Ernesto Zedillo said
Thursday before starting a helicopter tour of the disaster area.
	   ``The problem isn't a lack of means, but the conditions that
make it particularly difficult to reach those places we'd like to
be _ the communities where the people are beginning to have, or
already have, a shortage of drinking water,'' he said.
	   More than 20 helicopters were to arrive in Chiapas by Friday to
help relief teams reach isolated areas, Zedillo said.
	   Two highways along Chiapas' western coast were ``practically
destroyed,'' Zedillo said. About 650,000 people were without power.
	   A tour of Chiapas by about 50 diplomats, including U.S.
Ambassador Jeffrey Davidow, was canceled due to the disaster.
	   States throughout Mexico suffered flooding due to Tropical
Depression Javier in the Pacific and Tropical Storm Frances in the
Gulf of Mexico.
	   The Red Cross appealed for donations of clothing and drinking
water. Relief teams collected bundles of supplies in Mexico City.
	   Nearly 2 feet (50 cms) of rain fell in Tapachula between Monday
and Thursday morning. In Arriaga, a Chiapas town near Oaxaca state,
more than 16 inches (40 cms) of rain fell since Tuesday morning.
	   Muddy flood waters turned streets into violent rivers, sweeping
away roads and bridges and tearing down walls from concrete houses.
Chiapas authorities said seven bridges had fallen and another four
sustained structural damage.
	   Camacho told flood victims it would take a month to fix the
highway from Arriaga to Tapachula, a city of 250,000 people 10
miles (15 kms) from the Guatemala border.
	   At the city's Country Club, Marcela Chang Recinos, 44, waited
for aid with her eight children.
	   ``We have lost everything. Our house, food and harvest were
taken by the water,'' she said.
	   In the central state of Guanajuato, six people, including three
children, died Wednesday when a river washed away four homes in La
Estancia del Carmen.
	   Police in Nayarit state said Thursday they had recovered the
body of Maria Alberta Bautista, a 23-year-old mother of three, near
El Faisan.
	   In Jalisco, the body of a 17-year-old camper was recovered near
Zapopan on Wednesday. Three others died Tuesday in the same region.
	   Officials in Oaxaca on Thursday reported two deaths in coastal
communities _ one of a man whose house collapsed due to flooding
and another of a woman who drowned in a rain-gorged river.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iran asked the Security Council on
Thursday to urgently meet on the deaths of nine Iranian diplomats
in Afghanistan, calling it a war crime committed by the country's
Taliban leaders.
	   In a letter to the council president, Iran's ambassador, Hadi
Nejad-Hosseinian, called for the arrest and extradition of those
responsible.
	   The slayings display ``contempt by Taliban not only for the
recognized norms and principles of international law but also for
the very basic rules of human decency,'' he said.
	   The council cut short its originally scheduled consultations to
get an emergency briefing from the U.N. Assistant
Secretary-General, Alvaro de Soto.
	   Eleven Iranian diplomats vanished from Mazar-e-Sharif after the
Taliban religious militia seized the northern city from rival
forces on Aug. 8. The Taliban said Thursday that nine of the 11
were found dead Wednesday but denied responsibility for the
killings.
	   There was no word on the fate of two other diplomats.
	   The United Nations is considering participating in a mission to
investigate the reported deaths, a U.N. spokesman said Thursday.
	   The United Nations was planning to look into the kidnappings in
any case and ``today's news, if confirmed, would not change that,''
said spokesman Fred Eckhard. U.N. officials are conferring about a
possible mission with Iran and Pakistan.
	   Iran has blamed the Taliban for the deaths and has recently
stepped up military activities on the Afghan border in what U.S.
and other experts have said could be a prelude to a military
retaliation.
	   Last week, Iran conducted a massive exercise, with 70,000
troops, warplanes and tanks, on the Afghan border. Earlier
Thursday, Iran's army chief said new maneuvers would be held on the
Afghan border. He did not say when the new exercises would start.
	   The Taliban militia has vowed to respond to any Iranian military
strike. Asked how they would respond, a spokesman for the religious
movement, Noorullah Zadran, said: ``The same way we did to the
Russians,'' referring to the failed Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
	   He spoke at a panel Thursday on Afghanistan at Columbia
University in New York.
	   The Taliban blames Iran for backing the opposition northern
alliance which includes the minority Tajik, Uzbek and Hazara ethnic
groups, and Shiite Muslims. Iran, a predominantly Shiite country,
denies the allegation. The Taliban are mostly Pushtuns and follow a
strict Sunni version of Islam.

Pakistani court sentences first Muslim to death for blasphemy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS date of bishop's suicide to May 1998, sted last year.

<TEXT>
	   KHANPUR, Pakistan (AP) _ A Pakistani court has for the first
time sentenced a Muslim to death for blasphemy under a
controversial law that last year caused a Christian bishop to
commit suicide in protest and has drawn heated opposition from
human rights activists.
	   A lower court in the eastern Punjab town of Khanpur, some 420
kilometers (260 miles) south of the provincial capital of Lahore,
sentenced Ghulam Akbar Khan, a laborer, to death for taking the
name of Islam's profit Mohammed in vain, court officials said
Thursday.
	   Khan, a member of Pakistan's Shiite Muslim minority, was accused
of committing blasphemy during a scuffle with a rival Sunni Muslim
at a restaurant in May 1995. Khan has the right to appeal to a
higher court.
	   The blasphemy law was introduced in 1985 under the regime of
military dictator General Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq. It allows the death
penalty for anyone who profanes Mohammed or the religion of Islam.
	   Dozens of people belonging to Pakistan's minority religions,
including Christians, have been sentenced to death, but none have
so far been executed. They have were either acquitted by higher
courts, or fled the country while free on bail. However, there have
been reports of convicted blasphemers being murdered by Muslim
extremists.
	   In May, Roman Catholic Bishop John Joseph, 65, killed himself to
protest the blasphemy death sentence imposed on a fellow Pakistani
Christian. His death sparked widespread protests by Christians, who
number 2 million in this nation of 130 million people.
	   The Independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan and a number
of political parties and other groups denounce the blasphemy law,
calling it a tool used to persecute minorities. Shiite Muslims
represent about 15 percent, and other religions 2 percent, of the
population in Sunni Muslim dominated Pakistan.

Iraq reacts to UN suspension of sanctions review
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout with Iraqi government calling UN vote
unjust. &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council's decision to
suspend review of Iraq's economic sanctions is ``unjust,'' the
Iraqi government said Thursday.
	   President Saddam Hussein chaired a joint meeting of the ruling
Revolution Command Council and the leadership of the Baath Party
Thursday night to discuss the Security Council's vote, the official
Iraqi News Agency said.
	   It said the Iraqi leadership will meet again next week for more
discussions on the U.N. vote, apparently to work out an official
response. It did not give a specific date.
	   It said the National Assembly, or the Parliament, will also meet
to discuss vote.
	   The Security Council voted unanimously Wednesday to suspend the
six monthly reviews of the comprehensive trade sanctions imposed on
Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The resolution suspends a major, six-month review scheduled for
October, and all subsequent 60-day reviews until Iraq resumes
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The council's move retaliated for Iraq's decision Aug. 5 to
withdraw cooperation with U.N. inspectors seeking to check the
elimination of Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction.
	   Earlier this week, Iraq warned that it would take ``decisive
measures'' against such a vote by the Security Council.
	   The leading Iraqi newspaper Babil, which is owned by Saddam's
son, was the only publication to react Thursday to the U.N. vote.
	   It said the resolution was ``neither strange nor a surprise
because the understanding is that the sanctions will continue until
the United Nations, with the United States behind it, feel that
they are losing more than they are winning.''
	   The council's stand hardens the lines between the world body and
the Iraqi government over the santions. Saddam promised earlier
this year to have the embargo lifted by early next year.
	   But the council also gave Iraq an incentive to change its mind.
It agreed to conduct a ``comprehensive review'' of sanctions after
Iraq lets inspectors go back to work. Such a move could force the
council to acknowledge Iraq's progress of ridding itself of weapons
of mass destruction while generating pressure for a lifting of
sanctions.
	   U.N. arms experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the council will lift sanctions, which were imposed after
Iraq invaded Kuwait.
	   Iraq withdrew cooperation by refusing to provide the U.N.
inspectors with escorts, whose presence is essential to conduct
inspections.

Minister says South Africa cannot grant amnesty for overseas
</HEADLINE>
crimes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ A panel that has the power to
pardon people who committed crimes during the apartheid era cannot
grant amnesty for offenses committed abroad, the justice minister
said Thursday.
	   Justice Minister Dullah Omar was responding to speculation that
Britain may request extradition of former apartheid officials
involved in the 1982 London bombing of African National Congress
offices.
	   The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, set up to investigate
apartheid-era human rights violations, has the power to pardon
people who committed crimes, including murder.
	   But the commission ran into difficulty during testimony this
week because Gen. Johann Coetzee, a former apartheid-era police
commissioner, and seven other former state security officials are
seeking amnesty for the 1982 bombing, which occurred outside South
Africa. No one was killed.
	   While he recognized that South Africa does not have jurisdiction
abroad, Omar said he hoped other nations would ``take cognizance''
of the country's reconciliation process. The plea suggested he
hoped Britain would not aggressively seek to prosecute people who
are seeking forgiveness.
	   Scotland Yard confirmed this week that it is still investigating
the bombing case and has made no arrests.

IOC wants fresh water for athletes: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The International Olympic Committee
(IOC) will ask Sydney Games organizers to ensure that athletes are
providing with clean drinking water in case of contamination during
the 2000 Games, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   The Sydney Morning Herald said the move will come at an IOC
executive board meeting next week.
	   More than three million people in Sydney have been forced to
boil their drinking water after three contaminated water alerts in
six weeks. There are some reports which suggest it may take up to
six months for the problem to clear up.
	   Speaking from Belgium, the IOC's coordination commissioner for
the 2000 Games, Dr. Jacques Rogge, was quoted as saying the IOC
wanted to be sure there was no pollution of the water during the
Olympic Games and to know what contingency measures could be taken
at the Olympic Village.
	   Olympics Minister Michael Knight told the Herald that it was
astounding for people to start thinking the water contamination
crisis would be a problem for the Olympics. (djp)

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Native healers say their traditional
aphrodisiacs made of local plants and animals are more than a match
for the anti-impotence drug Viagra.
	   The sale of Viagra was legalized in Peru on Monday, and local
distributor Quimica Suiza has struggled to keep up with demand.
	   But the pill's cost _ dlrs 10 per tablet _ is prohibitively
expensive for many in Peru, where the minimum wage is dlrs 110 a
month.
	   ``It will never compete with my 'guanurpo macho.' Never!'' said
Lima healer Fermin Telada, holding up a gnarled, earth-covered root
and a bottle of red liquid.
	   A glass of Telada's ``guanurpo macho,'' made with Andean herbs,
roots and wine, costs 30 cents. Native healer Adrian Vega, who
sells an aphrodisiac made of blenderized frog, sea lion testicles
and an Andean root called maca mixed in a local cane liquor,
agrees.
	   ``It's my best seller,'' said Vega, citing his six children as
proof of its effectiveness.
	   Native healers, who trace their remedies and rituals back to
Peru's pre-Columbian Indian cultures, are popular with Peruvians,
who see them as an option to expensive modern medicine.
	   Native healers booths dot street markets in Lima and their
advertisements fill the pages of tabloid newspapers popular with
Peru's poor.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Police foiled an attempt by eight men to
kidnap a businessman Thursday in Mexico City and arrested one of
the abductors after a shootout and a car-and-helicopter chase.
	   The arrested suspect claimed he was a police officer
investigating a car theft, but police records showed he had been
fired recently for incompetence.
	   It was the second foiled kidnapping attempt in as many days. On
Wednesday a special anti-kidnapping unit caught two police officers
and four accomplices collecting a cash ransom for a wholesaler they
had kidnapped two days before.
	   A police report said the heavily armed kidnappers seized
furniture store owner Gilberto Canales Pina and a clerk outside a
warehouse, forced them into the pickup trucks and screeched away.
	   At least three patrol cars and a helicopter chase them for some
20 city blocks, snarling morning rush-hour traffic on the
south-side of the capital.
	   The victims were not harmed, despite an exchange of gunfire. The
kidnappers let them go when police started closing in on them.

	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ A top general says radical leaders of a
landless farmers' movement plan to pick a confrontation with
landowners to ``create victims and martyrs.''
	   Gen. Alberto Cardoso, the government's intelligence chief and
military liaison of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, said a
bloody conflict was brewing in the Pontal do Paranapamena region in
southwestern Brazil.
	   The general, who is not related to the president, attributed the
plan to a ``radical wing'' of the Landless Rural Workers Movement,
a group that organizes invasions of idle land to pressure the
government into speeding up agrarian reform.
	   Jose Rainha Jr., a Movement leader in the Pontal region, called
the charges ``idiotic.'' But he was widely quoted in Brazilian
media this week as saying that land invasions would ``heat up'' and
that the group would not back off from confronting armed guards
protecting private property.
	   Many Brazilians see a link with October national elections. The
Movement backs leftist presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da
Silva, who trails Cardoso in the polls.
	   In Brazil, about one-fifth of the people own nearly 90 percent
of the land, while the poorest two-fifths percent own just 1
percent.
	   ___
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Schoolteachers cannot be fired for
letting their students know they're gay, Colombia's highest court
has ruled.
	   In a 5-4 vote Wednesday, the Constitutional Court overturned a
1979 law which made a teacher's homosexuality grounds for
dismissal.
	   The measure was discriminatory, the court found in a ruling
applauded by gay rights advocates who argued that sexual preference
does not rub off on young people.
	   ``Homosexuality is not contagious, '' said German Humberto
Rincon, the lawyer who brought the lawsuit before the court. No
teachers had been fired under the 1979 law, but the court action
was important to prevent that from happening, Rincon said.
	   The decision applied to teachers from grade school through
university, including about 250,000 public school teachers.
	   There are no reliable estimates of the homosexual population in
this conservative and heavily Catholic nation, where homosexuality
is generally kept in the closet. Last week, a lesbian teacher wore
a mask when testifying at hearings on the issue.

	   TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) _ Flood victims in Chiapas state cried
out for food and clean water Thursday, desperate for the arrival of
aid flights that were blocked by heavy rain and poor visibility.
	   ``The children are crying because they haven't brought anything
to eat,'' one man angrily told a military officer at the Tapachula
Country Club, where 250 people sought shelter.
	   The officer, identified only as S. Camacho, said relief efforts
were being hurt by a shortage of gasoline and diesel.
	   ``If the secretary of defense doesn't bring us food, we're going
to eat rocks,'' Camacho said.
	   The flooding, said to be the region's worst in 50 years, has
knocked out bridges and roads to dozens of communities along the
Pacific coast. The condition of some areas was an ominous mystery
because even radio contact had been lost.
	   At least 40 people have been confirmed dead in flooding across
the country over the past week.
	   Chiapas suffered the heaviest toll, with 26 confirmed deaths and
at least 60 people missing. The dead included a police officer who
drowned during a rescue operation in Pijijiapan; five other
officers were missing.
	   A radio operator in Nueva Francia, about 40 miles (65 kms) north
of Tapachula, reported Thursday that a river had washed away about
20 homes with families inside _ but communication was lost and the
report could not be confirmed.
	   State civil protection director Romeo Leon Vidal said relief
teams had been unable to reach Pijijiapan, a city north of
Tapachula where 18 people had died, or several other towns for four
straight days.
	   ``It's a very grave situation,'' President Ernesto Zedillo said
Thursday before starting a helicopter tour of the disaster area.
	   ``The problem isn't a lack of means, but the conditions that
make it particularly difficult to reach those places we'd like to
be _ the communities where the people are beginning to have, or
already have, a shortage of drinking water,'' he said.
	   More than 20 helicopters were to arrive in Chiapas by Friday to
help relief teams reach isolated areas, Zedillo said in Tapachula,
a city of 250,000 people 10 miles (15 kms) from the Guatemala
border.
	   Two highways along Chiapas' western coast were ``practically
destroyed,'' Zedillo said. About 650,000 people were without power.
	   The state gas company Pemex said the collapse of seven bridges
in Chiapas made it impossible to deliver fuel.
	   A tour of Chiapas by about 50 diplomats, including U.S.
Ambassador Jeffrey Davidow, was canceled due to the disaster.
	   States throughout Mexico suffered flooding due to the Pacific's
Tropical Depression Javier, which was drifting southeast toward
Mexico, and Tropical Storm Frances in the Gulf of Mexico.
	   Seventeen ports along Mexico's two coasts were closed to small
craft. Authorities suspended all fishing and ocean recreational
activities due to storms and high waves.
	   Soldiers were sent to Zihuatanejo, some 700 miles (1,100 kms) up
the coast from Tapachula, to assist families dislodged from their
homes by flooding.
	   Nearly two feet of rain fell in Tapachula between Monday and
Thursday morning. In Arriaga, a Chiapas town near Oaxaca state,
more than 16 inches of rain fell since Tuesday morning.
	   Muddy floodwaters turned streets into violent rivers, sweeping
away roads and bridges and tearing down walls from concrete houses.
	   Military trucks delivered aid to Tonala across a muddy road, the
only open route into the city 130 miles north of Tapachula. The Red
Cross appealed for canned food, drinking water, shoes, diapers,
medicine and soap.
	   More than 4,000 were left homeless in the area _ at least 1,500
of them took refuge in 15 shelters in Tonala, the Red Cross said.
	   More than 300 people were reported homeless in Oaxaca state.
	   At the Tapachula Country Club, Marcela Chang Recinos, 44, waited
for aid with her eight children.
	   ``We have lost everything. Our house, food and harvest were
taken by the water,'' she said.
	   In the central state of Guanajuato, six people, including three
children, died Wednesday when a river washed away four homes in La
Estancia del Carmen.
	   Police in Nayrit state said Thursday they had recovered the body
of a 23-year-old mother of three. In Jalisco, the body of a
17-year-old camper was recovered near Zapopan on Wednesday. Three
others died Tuesday in the same region.
	   Officials in Oaxaca on Thursday reported two deaths in coastal
communities.

American satellites destroyed in Russian launch

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A rocket launched by Russia to put 12 U.S.
commercial satellites into orbit failed minutes after blast-off on
Thursday and partially burned up in the atmosphere along with its
cargo.
	   The Ukrainian-made Zenit-2 booster was launched shortly after
midnight by Russian space forces from the Baikonur cosmodrome,
which Moscow rents from the former Soviet republic of Kazakstan.
	   In the fifth minute of flight, the rocket's control system
failed, shutting down the engines.
	   Fragments of the rocket and the satellites fell in a sparsely
populated area in southern Siberia, the Russian Space Agency said
in a statement carried by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The Globalstar satellites were built by Space Systems Loral, a
subsidiary of Loral Space and Communications Ltd. of New York.
	   The satellites were going to be used as part of a dlrs 2.6
billion global hand-held mobile satellite phone system, said David
Benton, a spokesman for Space Systems Loral.
	   The lost satellites cost dlrs 190 million, which will be covered
by insurance companies, Benton said.
	   Globalstar plans to launch its next four satellites in November
and plans to have 32 satellites in orbit by late next year, he
said.
	   Ukraine will provide another Zenit booster for a new launch,
ITAR-Tass reported.
	   The Russian Space Agency blamed the Ukrainian manufacturer of
the rocket, the state-owned design and production center Yuzhnoye,
for the failed launch, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   ``The launching was considered Ukraine's responsibility; the
Russian side exercised only general coordination of the work under
the project,'' agency spokesman Vyacheslav Mikhailichenko said.
	   The contract's value wasn't announced, but a usual price for
such launches stands at around dlrs 30 million, the report said.
	   The Yuzhnoye press office partially acknowledged responsibility
later in the day, saying the failure might have been caused by
errors during manufacture of the booster.
	   ``At the present moment, we definitely exclude a rocket design
error, but we can theorize about manufacturing errors,'' the press
office said in a statement quoted by the Interfax news agency.
	   Yuzhnoye officials said the cause most likely was a malfunction
in the rocket's computer, which controlled its engines. The
computer was produced by an institute in Moscow, Interfax said.
	   An official investigation was underway.
	   Thursday's launch was the eighth failure of the two-stage
Zenit-2 out of a total of 31, but Russian and Ukrainian officials
declare it the best in its class and have ambitious plans for the
booster.
	   The same rocket, equipped with a third stage, is to be used in
the Sea Launch international program, which would carry out
commercial launches from ocean platforms.
	   On the Nasdaq Stock Market, shares of Globalstar plunged 40
percent, losing dlrs 7.12 1/2 to close at dlrs 10.75 per share.
	   Shares of Loral Space dropped dlrs 5.06 1/4, or 28 percent, to
close at dlrs 13. Loral Space was the most heavily traded issue on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 21 million shares changing hands.

Roundup of Cuban dissidents seen as a warning
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KEN GUGGENHEIM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ A roundup of Cuban dissidents this week shows that
the new religious freedoms offered by Fidel Castro's government
doesn't mean more liberty for political opponents, a top human
rights activist said Thursday.
	   At least 13 dissidents were arrested on Monday and Tuesday and
held for a day or two before being released without charges, said
Elizardo Sanchez, head of the Cuban Commission of Human Rights and
National Reconciliation.
	   Eight of those arrested had been involved in a small, but
unusually bold protest last month outside a court where a Cuban
dissident was being sentenced, he said. About 30 protesters had
chanted ``Down with the government'' and ``Down with Castro,''
Sanchez said in an interview.
	   He said the government apparently was trying to prevent the
dissidents from protesting at a Catholic religious procession
Tuesday. Another group of about 30 people was prevented from
leaving a house to join the procession, Sanchez said.
	   The procession on Havana streets was a sign of the new religious
freedoms enjoyed by Cubans since the visit by Pope John Paul II in
January.
	   But the arrests showed the ``dual policy'' of the Cuban
government, extending religious freedoms while keeping tight reins
on the political opposition, Sanchez said.
	   He said the arrests were aimed at punishing those who protested
when Reinaldo Alfaro Garcia was sentenced to three years in prison
for allegedly providing false information critical of Cuba to the
United States' Radio Marti. They were also intended to discourage
future protests, he said.
	   The Cuban government has made no announcements about the arrests
and a Cuban foreign ministry spokesman said at a news conference
that he knew nothing about them.
	   ``As far as I know, nobody has been arrested for anything
related to the trial of the counterrevolutionary Alfaro,''
Alejandro Gonzalez said.
	   For years, the government and Cuban dissidents had been locked
in a spiral in which protests led to greater repression, which in
turn triggered more protests, Sanchez said.
	   Since the pope's visit, the Cuban government has reduced the
repression, relying on brief detentions and police visits instead
of arrests, he said. That has led to fewer protests.
	   The demonstration outside the Alfaro sentencing was the largest
since the pope's visit and the arrests of the dissidents was the
government's greatest crackdown since then, he said.

Israeli security forces kill two in a clash in Hebron
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli security forces killed two men
they claimed were on their way to carrying out a terror attack
during a clash Thursday, the army said.
	   The confrontation broke out between Israeli forces and the two
men, after shooting and an explosion were heard in the area of
Hebron which is under Israeli control, the army spokesman said.
	   In the house where the two were killed - in an Israeli
controlled area - the army said it found a cache of weapons. The
type or amount of weapons found was not specified.
	   Hebron, traditionally a trouble spot, has been especially tense
since a rabbi was stabbed to death in his home last month,
apparently by a Palestinian militant.
	   No additional details about the incident were provided.
	   Israel Radio reported that police would be on alert for possible
revenge attacks.
	   Thirty thousand Palestinians live in the Israeli controlled
section of the city in uneasy proximity with 450 Jewish settlers.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ A towering figure in an impeccably tailored gray
suit rose from the defense table in a crowded downtown courtroom
Thursday, and with a sheepish grin told prospective jurors seated
10 feet (three meters) away, ``I'm Michael Jordan.''
	   That obvious declaration spelled out the challenge facing
attorneys handling a multimillion-dollar breach-of-contract lawsuit
against the Bulls superstar, alleging he reneged on a deal to star
in an obscure 1991 basketball film that flopped without him.
	   Finding 12 people with impartial feelings toward the biggest
sports hero in Chicago history and arguably the greatest basketball
star of all time ``will be an interesting challenge,'' plaintiffs'
attorney Dean Dickie said before entering the courtroom.
	   The 1993 lawsuit accuses Jordan of backing out of the
Chicago-made film, ``Heaven is a Playground'' after signing a 1988
contract guaranteeing him dlrs 350,000 plus 5 percent of the film's
profits.
	   Jordan was paid dlrs 50,000 up front but returned the money and
filed a counterclaim alleging that the producers lied when they
told him they had obtained financing in the summer of 1989, when
filming was supposed to have begun.
	   Jordan and his agent, David Falk, who also is named as a
defendant, also claim the contract was not legally binding.
	   The lawsuit seeks between dlrs 16 million and dlrs 20 million in
damages, or roughly what the producers think amounts to lost
earnings.
	   Jordan was to have portrayed a playground basketball star who
loses, then regains, his love of the game.
	   The film ultimately was made with former Loyola Marymount player
Bo Kimble.
	   ``Doesn't have the same ring, does it?'' Dickie said.
	   The production company, Heaven Corp., says it lost financing
when Jordan reneged, and the film, failing to get national
distribution, never made a profit.
	   Jordan attended jury selection accompanied by his wife, Juanita,
and planned to be in court throughout the trial because ``he
doesn't run away from things,'' said Jordan's attorney, Fred
Sperling.

Council condemns slaying of Iranian diplomats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with council condemning incident,
call for urgent investigation &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Acting on an urgent request from Iran, the
Security Council on Thursday condemned the slayings of nine Iranian
diplomats in Afghanistan and called for a speedy investigation to
bring the perpetrators to justice.
	   The United Nations, along with Iran and Pakistan, is considering
afact-finding mission into the deaths _ a move welcomed by the
council, council president Hans Dahlgren of Sweden said after an
emergency briefing on the matter.
	   Iran had asked the council to convene an urgent meeting on what
it said was a war crime committed by Afghanistan's Taliban leaders.
	   Eleven Iranian diplomats vanished from the northern Afghan city
of Mazar-e-Sharif after the Taliban religious militia seized the
city from rival forces on Aug. 8. The Taliban said Thursday that
nine of the 11 were found dead Wednesday but denied responsibility
for the killings.
	   There was no word on the fate of two other diplomats.
	   In a letter to the council president, Iran's ambassador, Hadi
Nejad-Hosseinian, called for the arrest and extradition of those
responsible.
	   The slayings display ``contempt by Taliban not only for the
recognized norms and principles of international law but also for
the very basic rules of human decency,'' he wrote.
	   He requested ``urgent consideration of this disturbing and
destabilizing development by the Security Council in order to take
urgent and necessary measures.''
	   Dahlgren said no further action was immediately planned, though
he said the council would be watching the situation closely.
	   The council cut short its originally scheduled consultations to
get an emergency briefing from the U.N. Assistant
Secretary-General, Alvaro de Soto, who provided information about
plans for a fact-finding mission.
	   ``The members of the council condemn these heinous acts and
violations of international law,'' Dahlgren said. ``They call for
an urgent investigation into these crimes so that the perpetrators
can be brought to justice.''
	   He repeated calls from the council that the Taliban ensure the
safety of the remaining diplomats and other Iranians in
Afghanistan.
	   The council calls ``on all concerned to exercise maximum
restraint in the situation,'' Dahlgren added.
	   Iran has blamed the Taliban for the deaths and has recently
stepped up military activities on the Afghan border in what U.S.
and other experts have said could be a prelude to a military
retaliation.
	   Last week, Iran conducted a massive exercise, with 70,000
troops, warplanes and tanks, on the Afghan border. Earlier
Thursday, Iran's army chief said new maneuvers would be held on the
Afghan border. He did not say when the new exercises would start.
	   The Taliban militia has vowed to respond to any Iranian military
strike. Asked how they would respond, a spokesman for the religious
movement, Noorullah Zadran, said: ``The same way we did to the
Russians,'' referring to the failed Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
	   He spoke at a panel Thursday on Afghanistan at Columbia
University in New York.
	   The Taliban blames Iran for backing the opposition northern
alliance which includes the minority Tajik, Uzbek and Hazara ethnic
groups, and Shiite Muslims. Iran, a predominantly Shiite country,
denies the allegation. The Taliban are mostly Pushtuns and follow a
strict Sunni version of Islam.

Deal believed imminent to end Air Canada strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Marathon contract talks between Air Canada and
its 2,100 pilots dragged on Thursday with both sides saying a
strike-ending agreement was imminent.
	   ``We're getting closer and I can see the light at the end of the
tunnel,'' Jean-Marc Belanger, chairman of the Air Canada Pilots
Association, said to reporters camped out in a downtown hotel where
the talks were taking place.
	   Negotiators have been working round the clock since returning to
the bargaining table Tuesday.
	   Salary seems to be the toughest issue, with the pilots demanding
a 12-per-cent catch-up increase over two years, and management
adamant that its offer of nine per cent is final. Pilots earn
Canadian dlrs 100,000 (U.S. dlrs 60,000) on average.
	   After an agreement is reached, it would take three full days to
get the planes back in the air in Canada, including two days to
conduct a ratification vote, while international flights would be
phased in later.

Israel seals off Palestinian lands, citing terror threat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with army announcing closure of West Bank and Gaza
effective early Friday, two killed in Hebron, trims &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Even as an American mediator held talks
Thursday aimed at setting terms for an Israeli pullback from the
West Bank, Israel clamped its first closure in nearly a year on the
Palestinian lands, citing terror threats.
	   The Israeli military was on high alert, the statement said.
	   The army said the sealing off of the West Bank and Gaza,
effective at 4 a.m. Friday (0100 GMT), was due to the threat of
attacks by terrorist groups, but provided no details. Palestinian
workers' access to Israel had not been denied since a suicide
bombing in Jerusalem last September 4.
	   The announcement came shortly after the army said two men it
described as would-be terrorists were slain in a confrontation with
Israeli troops in the West Bank town of Hebron, but it did not say
whether there was any connection with that incident.
	   Meanwhile, Israel was tight-lipped about any progress made in
talks with U.S. envoy Dennis Ross, and the Palestinians said
bridging gaps would be difficult.
	   And the unfolding crisis in Washington led some to wonder aloud
whether prospects for reviving the Mideast peace process would
suffer as a result of President Clinton's mounting troubles.
	   ``The uncertainty ... creates a situation of instability,''
former Palestinian Cabinet minister Hanan Ashrawi told CNN.
``Instead of making clear policy decisions ... everyone's
second-guessing what will happen to Clinton.''
	   Although Israeli officials publicly voiced confidence in the
Clinton administration's continuing peace efforts, commentators
were more pessimistic.
	   ``I think in a situation without an actively involved U.S.
president, the chances for a major crisis next year are
considerably increasing,'' said Ehud Yaari, a leading Israeli
commentator on Palestinian affairs.
	   Details of the U.S. independent counsel's report on Clinton
dominated Israeli news reports on Thursday, with coverage of the
visit of U.S. mediator Dennis Ross running a distant second.
	   Ross, whose visit is expected to last at least several more
days, held separate talks in Jerusalem with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and with top Palestinian officials.
	   Netanyahu's office issued a terse statement that made no
reference to any progress.
	   ``Israel still expects full reciprocity from the Palestinians,''
the statement said, without elaborating.
	   Ross himself was cautious about forecasting any breakthrough.
	   ``I'm seeing whether or not it's possible to narrow the
differences,'' he told reporters, adding there were indications the
two sides had ``the desire to try to find ways'' to do that.
	   But Israeli President Ezer Weizman was characteristically blunt
when asked after a Ross briefing whether he was optimistic based on
what he'd heard. ``No,'' he said.
	   Later, the American envoy met for 3 1/2 hours with Arafat deputy
Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, and Palestinian parliament
speaker Ahmed Qureia, also known as Abu Ala.
	   Abbas said afterward there was some room for encouragement, but
that reaching any accord would be ``very difficult.''
	   ``We hope to bridge the differences, but we are still at the
beginning,'' he said.
	   Afterward, Ross headed into a separate evening session with
senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat. After an hourlong talk,
Erekat left without speaking to reporters.
	   Radio and television reports on earlier meetings, meanwhile,
said the Israeli side was disappointed that Ross had not yet gotten
detailed responses on Palestinian security responsibilities, and
that Arafat told Ross the Palestinians were being unfairly blamed
for the impasse.
	   Outside the Jerusalem hotel where the talks took place, small
groups of opposing demonstrators faced off. Protesting the envoy's
visit were about 30 right-wing activists, who carried signs reading
``Ross Bug Off'' and ``No more land to Arafat.''
	   About a dozen counter-demonstrators from the group Peace Now
waved signs saying ``Save the peace process.''
	   On the table is a U.S. proposal for an Israeli withdrawal from
13 percent of the West Bank and detailed provisions for Palestinian
cooperation with Israel and the United States on security.
	   A security blueprint was worked out by Israeli, Palestinian and
U.S. security officials last December, but was rejected by
Netanyahu as insufficient. The Palestinians initially said they
would not agree to changes, but in recent days have softened their
position.

Low voter turnout in local government elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LLOYD WILLIAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ The election was years overdue but that
didn't seem to build anticipation.
	   Few voters turned out Thursday for the island's first local
government elections in nine years to fill 227 seats in parishes
and cities across Jamaica.
	   Poll workers said participation in the vote could fall as low as
30 percent. At one voting site in Kingston, the capital, where 158
voters were registered, only five had shown up by midday and just
seven of 142 registered voters had cast ballots by midafternoon at
another site.
	   About 45 percent of the electorate voted in the last local
elections in 1990. By contrast, general elections in Jamaica are
marked by high voter turnout and streets bustling with activity.
	   Local government elections are supposed to be held every three
years but the vote has been postponed several times as the
political parties considered electoral reform measures.
	   Results are expected Friday, said Director of Elections Danville
Walker.
	   The contestants were 227 candidates from the ruling People's
National Party, 224 from the opposition Jamaica labour Party, and
28 independent candidates.
	   The 30-month-old National Democratic Movement which, contested
the December 1997 general election, did not field any candidates in
Thursday's election and urged voters to boycott it because it says
the electoral system is corrupt.

Smith takes first step toward avoiding Q-school
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OAKVILLE, Ontario (AP) _ If Chris Smith can finish the season
the way he finished the first round of the Bell Canadian Open on
Thursday, he won't have to worry about keeping his PGA Tour card.
	   Playing his best golf after his worst shots, Smith closed with
three birdies and an eagle for a 6-under-par 66, giving him his
best start of the year and a two-stroke lead on the hard, fast and
wind-whipped Glen Abbey Golf Club.
	   Tim Herron, trying to win a tournament for the third straight
year, bogeyed the last hole and slipped into the group of six
players at 4-under 68 that included Billy Andrade, Scott Verplank
and Dudley Hart.
	   ``When I got in trouble, I was able to come back and do
something good,'' said Smith, who took only 25 putts on greens that
featured Sunday-type pin positions. ``The course wasn't giving
anything up today.''
	   Smith snatched a 66 with iron play that set up four birdies
inside 15 feet (4.6 meters) and booming drives that allowed him to
play the par-5s in 4-under. He charged into the lead with a
341-yard (312-meter) drive that left him only a 9-iron into the
par-5 18th, which he drilled downwind to 8 feet (2.4 meters) for
eagle.
	   Jeff Sluman, coming off a win last week in Milwaukee, was
6-under at one point until three straight bogeys dropped him into
the group at 69. Another stroke back was Ernie Els, playing only
his 15th PGA Tour event this year and trying to get into the top 30
on the money list.
	   Smith's situation is far more dire.
	   Having missed 13 cuts in 25 events, he is 132nd on the money
list and needs a strong finish to avoid going to qualifying school,
where he has never played well enough to earn his card.
	   ``You want to try to block it out as much as you can, but that's
pretty unrealistic,'' Smith said. ``It's a thought that's with you.
If you're on the bubble like I am, it's a little bit tougher. It's
something that's definitely in the back of my mind.''
	   Playing for the sixth week in a row, PGA champion Vijay Singh
shot a 2-over 74 for his worst opening round since a 75 in the
season-opening Mercedes Championship in January.
	   Even in the softness of the morning, the greens were like thin
carpet over hardwood floors. Pins tucked along the ridges on the
Jack Nicklaus-designed greens made it even more difficult.
	   Smith bogeyed No. 3 with a three-putt from 45 feet (13.7
meters), but answered with a sand wedge that stopped 2 feet (0.6
meters) away for birdie on No. 4 and an up-and-down from off the
green on the par-5 fifth hole for another birdie.
	   His only other bogey came on the par-4 14th. After driving in
the bunker and coming up short, his third shot caught the ridge and
rolled 30 feet (9.1 meters) away. But he birdied the next three
holes, then finished it off with an eagle.
	   ``Fortunately after my mistakes, I came back with birdies,'' he
said. ``That's what you have to do to score good.''
	   Andrade, having his worst season since his rookie year in 1988,
also got off to a strong start with birdies on five of the first 10
holes and pars on the five holes through the valley of Glen Abbey.
His only lapse was a bogey on No. 17, where he failed to get up and
down from the bunker.
	   Hart's only mistake came in the middle of his round. Starting on
No. 10, he was 3-under for the day when he pulled his 3-iron into
No. 18, causing spectators to scatter on a hill left of the green.
He tried to get it close despite an awkward lie, and the ball ran
through the green and into the water. He wound up with a bogey.
	   ``I tried to pull off a miracle shot,'' Hart said. ``This course
can jump up and get you real quick if you try to get real greedy.''

	   TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) _ Victims of widespread flooding in
southern Mexico appealed for food and drinking water Thursday, and
unconfirmed reports indicated the death toll could be much higher
than what has been officially confirmed.
	   ``Children are crying because they haven't brought anything to
eat,'' one man angrily told a military officer at the Tapachula
Country Club, where 250 people sought shelter.
	   But the tragedy may be much greater along a 100-mile (160-kms)
stretch of coastline northwest of Tapachula, where cut roads and
bridges and heavy rains have made it impossible for rescue workers
to operate.
	   A government shortwave radio operator in the town of Acapetagua,
60 miles (100 kms) northwest of Tapachula, told military officers
in Tapachula on Thursday that 100 bodies were floating in a lagoon
nearby, The Associated Press has learned.
	   ``There are more than 100,'' she said in a recording obtained by
the AP. ``The sea has them. They're floating in the lagoon.''
	   She said villagers had pulled two bodies from the lagoon, but
that the strong current made it impossible to reach the others.
	   The government has confirmed 40 deaths _ 26 in Chiapas and the
rest in other states _ after a week of steady rain _ nearly two
feet (60 cms) in some areas _ caused the worst flooding in half a
century. Sixty people are reported missing in Chiapas.
	   The report from Acapetagua could not be confirmed, but
government officials have said they expect the death toll to rise
dramatically once they reach towns cut off by the flooding.
	   ``It's a very grave situation,'' said President Ernesto Zedillo,
who toured the Chiapas disaster zone by helicopter on Thursday.
	   He said bad weather and damaged roads were making it
``particularly difficult to reach those places we'd like to be _
the communities where the people are beginning to have, or already
have, a shortage of drinking water.''
	   He said more than 20 helicopters were to arrive in Chiapas by
Friday to help relief teams reach isolated areas.
	   The muddy torrents turned streets into violent rivers, sweeping
away roads and bridges and tearing down walls from concrete houses.
	   Thousands have fled their homes. About 4,500 people sought
refuge in temporary shelters and 650,000 were left without electric
power.
	   Among the hardest towns was Pijijiapan, 50 miles (80 kms) north
of Tapachula, where at least 18 people died, including a police
officer who drowned during a rescue mission.
	   Most of Mexico was being pounded by storms off the Pacific and
Gulf coasts, and severe flooding was reported in many areas.
Forecasters predicted more rain for southern and eastern Mexico.
	   Seventeen ports along Mexico's two coasts were closed to small
craft and authorities suspended all fishing and ocean recreational
activities.
	   Soldiers were sent to Zihuatanejo, some 700 miles (1,100 kms) up
the coast from Tapachula, to assist flood victims.
	   Flooding deaths were also reported in Guanajuato, Nayarit,
Jalisco and Oaxaca states.
	   The Red Cross appealed for donations and relief teams collected
bundles of supplies in Mexico City.
	   Rain continued to fall Thursday in Tapachula, a city of 250,000
people 10 miles (15 kms) from the Guatemala border, which had
received 22.5 inches (57 cms) of rain since Monday.
	   A military rescue worker, who identified himself as S. Camacho,
said relief efforts were being hurt by a shortage of fuel.
	   ``If the secretary of defense doesn't bring us food, we're going
to eat rocks,'' Camacho said.
	   The state gas company Pemex said the collapse of seven bridges
in Chiapas made it impossible to deliver fuel.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks plunged for a second straight session
Thursday, erasing all of Tuesday's gains, as hope for a recovery on
Wall Street quickly faded amid a continuing problems in the global
economy and Washington. The Dow Jones industrial average fell
249.48 points, or 3.2 percent, to 7,615.54. The blue-chip index was
down as much as 345.52 in the last half hour of trading before
attempting a late recovery. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks also skidded lower in Europe, with the
major index finishing down 5.8 percent in Germany, a major trading
partner of beleaguered Russia. Russian President Boris Yeltsin
assured German Chancellor Helmut Kohl by phone Thursday that his
new choice for prime minister would stick to market reforms if
confirmed, the German government said. Shares closed down 3.3
percent in London, Europe's largest market, and were off 4.6
percent in Paris. In Sao Paulo, Brazil, trading temporarily stopped
at Latin America's largest exchange after a 10 percent plunge in
its main index after 67 minutes of trading. Shares tumbled even
further when trading resumed amid worries about a devaluation of
Brazil's currency and the selloff on Wall Street. (WORLD STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Reflecting global economic turmoil, the
deficit in the broadest measure in the U.S. trade performance
jumped 20 percent in the April-June quarter to a record dlrs 56.5
billion. The current-account deficit, reported Thursday by the
Commerce Department, rose from a record dlrs 46.7 billion in the
first quarter. The increase puts the nation on track to register a
deficit above dlrs 200 billion for all of 1998. That would be the
worst since the government began tracking the data just after World
War II, and would beat the record of dlrs 168 billion set in 1987.
Last year's deficit was dlrs 155 billion. (US-ECONOMY)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's prime minister outlined a set of economic
proposals Thursday designed to revitalize the country's
recession-hit industries and uplift living standards for the
average Japanese. Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi unveiled the plans
after a meeting of a special economic strategy task force which
drafted the recommendations. The centerpiece of the package is a
vaguely worded proposal for doubling the amount of housing, working
and recreation space within five years. The twin plans are a key
part of the embattled Obuchi administration's answer to mounting
concern over the outlook for the Japanese economy, which shows few
signs of pulling out of a prolonged slump, and longstanding quality
of life issues in crowded Japan. (JAPAN-OBUCHI'S NEW DEAL)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's crippled currency and stock markets
showed new life Thursday, continuing their recovery while the
country's political crisis neared resolution. Both were heartened
by President Boris Yeltsin's decision to nominate a compromise
candidate for prime minister _ Yevgeny Primakov, the current
foreign minister who is expected to win swift approval in
parliament. The stock market rose on the news, closing up nearly 5
percent at 64.60 points. Perhaps more important, trading volume _
which has been negligible in recent days _ improved to dlrs 3.1

rubles to the dollar on the Moscow interbank exchange, up from
13-15 rubles late Wednesday. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   WASHINGTON (AP ) _ There are grave risks for the United States
and the stability of the global economy if Russia fails to set its
economy back on the reform course, a senior Clinton administration
official warned Thursday. Treasury Undersecretary for International
Affairs David Lipton and International Monetary Fund deputy
director Stanley Fischer also said IMF financial aid to Russia will
not resume until a new government restores coherent economic
policies and shows it can carry them out. Russia was supposed to
receive a dlrs 4.3 billion second installment payment Sept. 15 that
was part of a dlrs 22.5 billion IMF rescue package agreed on in
July. Finance and foreign ministry officials from the world's seven
richest countries are scheduled to next Monday in London to discuss
how to help Russia. (IMF-RUSSIA)

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Democrats braced Thursday for damaging
disclosures about President Bill Clinton as the House of
Representatives moved toward releasing portions of Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr's report on possible impeachable offenses.
Republican leaders announced plans to post the material on the
Internet once the House grants its expected approval on Friday.
Some Democrats expressed unease about the evidence resting in a
vault under armed guard a few blocks from the Capitol. They pressed
for Clinton, a Democrat, to be given an advance copy and a day or
two to offer a written rebuttal before the information is made
public. Republicans rejected the move. (CLINTON-CONGRESS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliament hopes to resolve one crisis
Friday by confirming a compromise figure _ Yevgeny Primakov _ as
prime minister, permitting the government to tackle its second
crisis, the ruined economy. Primakov, the long-time foreign
minister, was expected to win swift and resounding approval from
the lower house of parliament, the State Duma, even though he has
little economic experience. Primakov, a former KGB spy chief
respected across the political spectrum, will need to quickly
assemble a Cabinet to deal with the most severe economic crisis
since the Soviet collapse. Yeltsin settled on Primakov after
parliament twice rejected Viktor Chernomyrdin.(RUSSIA-POLITICS)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Taliban religious militia said
Thursday that unidentified soldiers within its ranks killed nine of
11 Iranian diplomats missing in Afghanistan. The Taliban claimed
responsibility for the deaths in a letter from their supreme
leader, Mullah Omar, to Secretary-General Kofi Annan. A Taliban
spokesman had said earlier that the nine were killed but denied
responsibility. The bodies of the nine were found a month after
they vanished when the Taliban seized the northern Afghan city of
Mazar-e-Sharif from rival forces on Aug. 8. The Taliban, ``while
expressing sadness, announces that the nine Iranian workers who
entered Mazar-e-Sharif during the war, either intentionally or
unintentionally, have been killed by unidentified (Taliban)
soldiers,'' the letter from Mullah Omar said. He stressed that the
soldiers acted on their own.( AFGHANISTAN-IRAN-DIPLOMATS)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk appealed to
the army and police Thursday to stop shooting monks and others
protesting against strongman Hun Sen, whose control of the capital
looked increasingly in doubt after days of street clashes. The
king's plea came after police fired into a crowd of demonstrators
Thursday, seriously wounding a student in the neck but failing to
prevent a protest that swelled to more than 6,000. The king _ who
has only token power but remains a force in Cambodia _ called on
authorities to ``stop using guns to shoot demonstrators and monks.
If the people do something wrong, please don't use violence. It is
killing the nation.'' The king's terse message and the march came
during the fourth day of police action to suppress protests against
Hun Sen's rule following disputed elections July 26. At least one
person has died in the violence. (CAMBODIA)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Setting aside profound
suspicions, Protestant leader David Trimble talked in depth for the
first time Thursday with Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams about the proposed
Northern Ireland government. ``We are now dealing with the crisis
in the way it should be dealt with _ by direct dialogue,'' Adams
said after meeting for 45 minutes alone with Trimble, who was
elected ``first minister'' of the embryonic government in July.
Trimble had refused to talk directly with Adams' IRA-allied party
since his 1995 election as leader of the Ulster Unionists, the
major representative of Northern Ireland's British Protestant
majority. But both leaders came away from the encounter sounding
hopeful that their fundamental differences could be narrowed. Adams
expects his party to hold two positions in a possible 12-member
administration, which is being drawn from a much larger legislative
Assembly elected in June. (NORTHERN IRELAND)

Christodoulos, Viagra in Poland, Fabian, German discos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ French fashion designer Pierre Cardin on
Thursday unveiled a scale model of a fluorescent obelisk which he
aims to build in Alexandria as a millennium tribute to the Egyptian
city's famed lighthouse _ the lost seventh wonder of the world.
	   Cardin, who is a UNESCO peace ambassador, presented the working
model, which features glittering multicolored lights and laser
beams, at the Lisbon world's fair.
	   ``It represents light, peace, and it rises towards the sky, so
it has hope _ and this is what we want to see in the year 2000
throughout the world,'' Cardin said.
	   The concrete-and-glass monument, planned at 145 metres (160
yards) tall, is to stand on the tip of a jetty overlooking the Bay
of Alexandria, only a few meters (yards) from where the original
lighthouse stood before it was destroyed by an earthquake in 1349.
	   Egyptian officials granted approval for the dlrs 86 million
obelisk last month, though the project is still short of financing.
	   Some 16,500 computer-controlled lights inside the column are to
illuminate the obelisk, while powerful lasers cast beams out to sea
and back onto Alexandria's historical monuments.
	   ___
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) _ Steven Spielberg sent his regrets and a
Hollywood-style thanks to the American Legion, which honored him
with an award for ``Saving Private Ryan.''
	   In a videotaped message played on big-screen televisions for
thousands of veterans at the legion's national convention,
Spielberg called World War II ``the defining event of the 20th
century.''
	   ``Now, with the response to `Saving Private Ryan,' generations
are coming together to understand how fortunate we are today to
live in a free world because of what you and the millions of other
veterans did for us,'' the director said in the message played
Wednesday.
	   Spielberg, who was in Europe for the movie's opening there, was
given the group's ``Spirit of Normandy'' award.
	   ___
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Archbishop Christodoulos has told young
men it's all right with him if they wear earrings when they see
their pastors _ as long as they do visit.
	   ``Don't take anything off, not even the earring from your ear.
You are our children, no atter how you look, and that's enough for
us. We can work things out, as long as we meet,'' the head of the
Orthodox Church of Greece _ considered a bastion of conservatism _
said Thursday.
	   The message, part of an address to high school students, was
issued one day before the start of the new academic year.
	   The message came just two days after Christodoulos called on
Greeks to end discrimination against people infected with AIDS,
after making the first-ever visit to a treatment center by a head
of the Church.
	   ``We can discuss anything. The tragic dead ends of our society,
the uplifting of our hearts, the lack of love, drugs, AIDS and
violence,'' Christodoulos said in his address.
	   ___
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A government minister's proposal to
subsidize Viagra prescriptions to boost Poland's birthrate on
Thursday drew accusations from feminists that the government cares
more about men's pleasure than women's health.
	   The Federation for Women and Family Planning slammed the
proposal, which follows a decision by the Solidarity-led government
to cut subsidies for contraception in its effort to reverse a
decline in Polish births.
	   ``The current government cares more about pleasure of men than
health care for women,'' the group said.
	   The government minister for family issues, Kazimierz Kapera,
said subsidizing Viagra would ``boost births in our homeland.''
	   A government report on Polish families released in July showed a
20 percent decrease in marriage rates and a 30 percent decrease in
birth rates since Poland's 1989 transition to a market economy.
	   ___
	   UNIONTOWN, Pennsylvania (AP) _ The singer of ``Turn Me Loose''
will be singing a different tune.
	   Fabian Anthony Forte, the 1950s singer known better by his first
name, filled out a marriage application Tuesday at the county
courthouse.
	   Fabian, 55, will marry Andrea Lynn Patrick, a 37-year-old former
Miss Pennsylvania, later this month.
	   Fabian, a native of Philadelphia, could not keep his identity
secret from the chief deputy register of wills when he arrived at
the courthouse.
	   ``I knew who he was because he was popular in my time,''' Janet
Seese said.
	   ___
	   SCHWERIN, Germany (AP) _ An eastern German state and private
sponsors are trying to deter drunken driving by offering half-rate
taxi fares for young people heading to and from dance clubs.
	   The offer in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, which has three
times the national average for alcohol-related traffic accidents,
is good from Sept. 15 through the end of next year, state officials
said Thursday.
	   The state, the Esso oil company and a car-rental and taxi
industry group will compensate taxi drivers for their lost revenue.
	   Though the initiative is aimed at ``young people,'' it
stipulates no specific age; cab riders simply must be on their way
to or from a disco.

Russian political crisis nears resolution; economy awaits action

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliament hopes to resolve one crisis by
confirming a compromise figure _ Yevgeny Primakov _ as prime
minister, permitting the government to tackle its second crisis,
the ruined economy.
	   Primakov, the long-time foreign minister, was expected to win
swift and resounding approval Friday from the lower house of
parliament, the State Duma, even though he has little economic
experience.
	   ``Common sense has prevailed in our state,'' said Communist
leader Gennady Zyuganov, who spearheaded the opposition to the
previous candidate for premier, Viktor Chernomyrdin.
	   In Washington, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the U.S.
government ``knows and respects'' Primakov. ``We would expect to
have a good and close working relationship.''
	   Primakov, a former KGB spy chief respected across the political
spectrum, will need to quickly assemble a Cabinet to deal with the
most severe economic crisis since the Soviet collapse. The ruble
has plummeted, industrial production is stagnant and the government
is broke.
	   Despite such deep economic problems, Primakov's nomination
raised hopes on Russia's battered markets. The price of the ruble
lifted to 12.87 to the dollar _ up from 16.99 last Friday _ and the
stock market climbed nearly 5 percent.
	   Primakov, 68, is supported by all but one of parliament's
factions. He is seen as a technocrat, non-ideological and loyal to
Yeltsin.
	   The low-key, publicity shy foreign minister appears more
comfortable handling discrete diplomatic negotiations than enduring
the glare of publicity that his new job will bring.
	   Primakov is expected to support economic reforms, but he has not
made any public comments about what sort of program he envisions.
	   As foreign minister, Primakov won praise at home for his efforts
to restore some of Russia's diminished international clout and
create a ``multipolar'' world designed to counterbalance U.S.
dominance.
	   Primakov has cool but cordial relations with the United States.
There has been periodic friction over his desire to ease sanctions
against Iraq, maintain nuclear cooperation with Iran, and resist
NATO's expansion.
	   Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev picked him as one of his
closest aides during the reform period of the late 1980s.
	   He entered the international spotlight at the end of 1990 when,
shortly before the Gulf War began, he made several high-profile
trips to Iraq and tried unsuccessfully to persuade Saddam Hussein
to withdraw from Kuwait.
	   Primakov was briefly first deputy director of the KGB, the main
Soviet security organization in 1991. After the Soviet breakup, he
served as head of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service until
Yeltsin named him foreign minister in 1996.
	   Yeltsin settled on Primakov after parliament twice rejected
Chernomyrdin, with opposition leaders vowing to vote him down again
on a third and final vote.
	   Chernomyrdin served five years as prime minister before Yeltsin
fired him last March. Many Russians blame him for the country's
economic problems.

Mitsubishi group firms to link up in investment-trust market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and the three other
finance companies of the Mitsubishi group will join forces in the
investment-trust, pension, insurance and securities markets, a news
report said Friday.
	   Tokyo-Mitsubishi will link up with Mitsubishi Trust and Banking
Corp., Meiji Life Insurance Co. and Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance
Co., the Nihon Keizai financial daily said.
	   The group plans to set up a jointly owned investment-trust
company by the end of this year. The four firms, which have
operated independently up to now, also plan to work together in
developing and selling insurance products, the Nihon Keizai said.
	   The four companies are preparing for increased competition as
Japan's ``Big Bang'' deregulation measures lower the barriers
dividing banking, insurance and securities brokerage.
	   The alliance is expected to step up the pressure on competitors
to restructure and pursue similar deals.
	   A formal announcement on the tie-up was expected later Friday,
the Nihon Keizai said.

	   BATESVILLE, Indiana (AP) _ No Chamber of Commerce sign welcomes
visitors to the Casket Capital of the World. There's no Graveyard
Inn, with special rates for undertakers. Around the bar at
Charlie's Hide-a-way, the regulars aren't given to jokes about
embalming fluid.
	   You see, in Batesville, death is just a way of life.
	   ``That's never occurred to me,'' said Harold Gardner, a retired
newspaperman who covers events in Batesville and nearby Oldenburg
in a weekly newsletter. ``I can't explain it, except people here
accept it as their craft. They make useful things, and it just so
happens it's used to bury the dead.''
	   This is the home of the Batesville Casket Co., part of
Hillenbrand Industries Inc., a publicly traded dlrs 4 billion
company. It's the nation's largest casket maker, writing paychecks
for 3,700 people who build caskets, cremation prod fun with all of this.
	   Dropping his bearish figure into an office chair, he flashes a
goateed grin at the mention of his desk pen set. Resting on the
base beside a standard-issue ballpoint pen is a six-inch
(15-centimeter) model of a pecan-colored wooden casket.
	   ``It's a hell of a conversation piece,'' says the mayor. ``I
wish the lid would open. That'd be a great place to put your
business card. Everybody notices it.''
	   In this southeastern Indiana town of 5,000, caskets have been
part of the furniture since 19th-century Germans settled amid
forests of oak, cherry and walnut.
	   The cleared timber gave birth to Batesville Coffin Co., a
moribund enterprise when John A. Hillenbrand, the son of a German
immigrant, bought it in 1906.
	   As the company steadily grew, Hillenbrand money transformed
nearly every street corner in town.
	   ``If it wasn't for Hillenbrand, there wouldn't be any
Batesville,'' said Mike Moll, a craftsman of caskets and cremation
urns for 20 years. At least not a Batesville that Moll could
recognize.
	   His four children were born at Margaret Mary Community Hospital,
which the John A. Hillenbrand Foundation bailed out of financial
woes in 1966. His 18-year-old daughter teaches swimming at the YMCA
built with Hillenbrand money.
	   The three younger children swim at the Batesville public pool
and check out books from the 40,000-volume public library _ both
built with Hillenbrand donations.
	   The Moll kids attend Batesville public schools, where
Hillenbrand contributions helped wire classrooms for the Internet.
	   When the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra plays its annual concert
at Hillenbrand-supported Liberty Park, the Molls can attend free of
charge, the tab picked up by the Hillenbrand-funded Rural Alliance
for the Arts.
	   That's not to mention the country club, the downtown German
restaurant and hotel, even a housing subdivision _ all owned or
developed with Hillenbrand money.
	   ``There isn't a spot in town they didn't put their hand on,''
said former mayor Victor Kaiser.
	   Gus Hillenbrand, the corporation's courtly chairman and CEO,
offers this explanation.
	   ``This is our home and has been our home since the mid-1880s.
Batesville is not only where we do business, it is also where we
live, raise our children, attend church and have friendships.''
	   A friendly warning greets motorists following a Batesville
Casket Co. semi-trailer truck. ``Please drive safely. Heaven can
wait.''
	   Batesville Casket can afford to be patient, too. While a few
clever or larcenous souls may escape taxes, the other inevitability
bears down. The number of deaths in the United States has been
holding steady at 2.3 million a year since the mid-1980, but
there's a demographic silver (satin?) lining for folks in the
burial industry. Grim reality will reap more and more sales as the
United States grows older.
	   The nation's fastest-growing population segment is the over-85
age group. By 2015 an increasingly creaky U.S. population will be
yielding up an estimated 3.2 million dearly departed a year.
	   And life will go on in Batesville.

Greek women seek greater voice when marriages fall apart

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Hara Ventouris' life took an opulent turn
when she married into one of Greece's shipping dynasties.
	   There was a seaside villa, her black Mercedes and servants to
help care for the couple's three small children.
	   It all went bad in 1995.
	   Her husband, George Ventouris, ordered her out to make room for
his mistress, pregnant with their second out-of-wedlock child. He
also demanded custody of the children from the marriage.
	   Ms. Ventouris tried to fight back. But her millionaire husband
was awarded child custody based in part on his fortune.
	   ``Unfortunately in Greece when someone has a huge amount of
money, they can do anything they want,'' said Ms. Ventouris, 37.
	   But female lawyers, politicians and activists are banding
together to push for a new family court that they hope will change
the way divorce and child custody cases are handled.
	   The proposed court is part of a larger initiative by Greek women
to erase inequities in laws and customs in a nation that only
formally outlawed the dowry system in 1983.
	   Some changes _ prompted by the European Union and Greece's
modernizing economy _ are clearly evident. More women are in the
work force, and the birth rate is down sharply as women delay
marriage for career and lifestyle reasons.
	   But society is often more easily modified than bureaucracy. The
legal system _ and especially child custody and divorce issues _
have become one of the key showdowns for feminists.
	   ``In attitude we have accomplished a certain amount, but not in
practice,'' said Margaret Papandreou, the American-born former wife
of the late Premier Andreas Papandreou.
	   For Mrs. Papandreou, establishing a family court would be an
important domestic victory in her mainly international campaigns,
which include trying to promote cultural ties with Greece's
longtime rival, Turkey.
	   The court's supporters hope to get parliamentary approval this
fall. But Bobbis Georgoulos, a press spokesman for the Justice
Ministry, said creating the court ``is not a priority for the
ministry'' at the moment.
	   In 1983, Greek legal reforms abolished a father's right to sole
parental authority over children. Theoretically, it imposed
equality among parents seeking child custody.
	   But old mentalities die hard. In some cases, judges still award
custody on the basis of the economic assets of the parent instead
of giving weight to the emotional well-being of the children as is
done in the United States and many other European nations,
activists say.
	   ``The courts should be based on the interests of the child ...
affection, love, care, concern. These things you cannot put money
signs on,'' Mrs. Papandreou said.
	   There are no comprehensive statistics available on custody cases
in Greece. But Mrs. Papandreou said anecdotal evidence suggests men
are still favored in court rulings because of their greater
financial resources _ a consequence of Greece's very weak rules
enforcing alimony and child support payments.
	   ``In Greece, the paradox exists that we create laws but never
implement them ... ,'' said Chrisoula Contoyiannis, director of the
Greek branch of the International Social Service, a worldwide
agency that deals with inter-country adoptions and legal rights of
foreigners. ``The mentality of a judge that is judging a family
does not change because the law changes. There has to be
education.''
	   The proposed custody reforms would bring in neutral social
agencies to assess the competence of each parent, said Layla
Andoniou, who is a member of the group pushing the family court
proposal and was a member of the lawyers committee that drew up the
1983 reform laws.
	   Obtaining a divorce also could become easier under the proposed
reforms.
	   Instead of waiting for separate rulings on alimony, child
custody and the termination of the marriage, all decisions would be
made at the same time. The current system allows each ruling to be
appealed individually, which can drag a divorce out for years.
	   Although many women's right groups have rallied about the
proposed family court, they consider the much bigger battle is
trying to change entrenched attitudes.
	   ``The law does not change people; it regulates circumstances,''
said Ellie Xenou, a Justice Ministry lawyer. ``If thousands of
social ills do not change _ if there is no reaction from the
community _ we won't fix the problems.''

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Swissair Flight 111 crashed into the
ocean off Nova Scotia with such force that the impact registered at
a regional seismic center, investigators said Thursday.
	   Only 2 percent of the aircraft has been retrieved so far, mostly
small pieces that were floating on the surface of the Atlantic,
said Vic Gerden, the chief crash investigator.
	   Gerden confirmed that parts of a seat cover from the cockpit
showed signs of soot and heat damage, a sign that perhaps they had
been seared by fire or intense heat. He said fire and explosion
experts were still assessing the seat cover and other heat-damaged
items from the cockpit.
	   Gerden repeatedly skirted questions from reporters about
specific theories as to why the plane crashed, including the
possibility of electrical-wiring problems.
	   ``We're not zeroing in on anything at this point,'' he said.
	   He also gave new details about the last minutes of Flight 111,
which crashed Sept. 2 en route from New York to Geneva, killing all
229 people on board.
	   He said the last signal from the plane came just after 10:26
p.m. Atlantic time (0126 GMT), when it was flying at 9,700 feet
(2,950 meters) at a speed of 275 mph (443 kph).
	   The plane disappeared from radar screens five minutes later, and
a few seconds after that an impact was recorded on seismic graphs
at a geological center 25 miles (40 kilometers) away near Halifax,
Gerden said. He said he did not know if a measurement of the impact
had been taken.
	   The pilots had reported smoke in the cockpit about 16 minutes
before the crash, and were trying to dump fuel before making an
emergency landing at Halifax airport.
	   Gerden said the plane's recovered flight data recorder indicated
irregularities in various systems on the plane during the last five
minutes before the recorder stopped working, one minute before the
plane's last signal.
	   He said experts are assessing the pattern of the problems,
hoping to trace them to a common area of the aircraft.
	   Several larger pieces of the plane, including sections of the
fuselage, have been located at a depth of 190 feet (60 meters), and
a U.S. Navy salvage ship, the USS Grapple, has arrived to try to
raise those pieces over the next few days.
	   Divers are trying to retrieve bodies from the wreckage and also
recover the plane's cockpit voice recorder, but rough seas Thursday
forced a delay in the diving operations.
	   The head of the medical team trying to identify the fragmented
human remains from the crash said two more identifications were
made Thursday. They were only the third and fourth victims
identified in the week since the disaster.
	   Dr. John Butt said both were made through dental records, and
one involved an American passenger. He declined to give further
details or the names of those identified.
	   Butt said his team has completed work on all the remains
retrieved thus far. He said they hope to get more remains after a
naval recovery team manages to raise parts of the fuselage.
	   Butt, Nova Scotia's chief medical examiner, said the water
around that wreckage is cold enough to preserve bodies for an
extended period.
	   None of the remains recovered thus far have shown any traces of
fire or smoke inhalation, and Butt said he doubted the work of his
team would provide major clues for investigators trying to find the
cause of the crash.
	   Butt has been frank about the emotional toll the disaster, and
the condition of the remains, has taken on him and his team.
	   ``I do have trouble with it at times,'' he told a news briefing.
``But it doesn't interfere with the clarity of my thinking.''

Ex-Communists look for shot of new life in German election
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC;

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The former East German Communists have
set an ambitious goal for the Sept. 27 parliamentary election:
Gaining votes in hostile western Germany, especially from young
people bored with mainstream politics.
	   Snappy street posters, apologies for its Stalinist past and a
rally in this German banking center are part of an election
campaign designed to dump the party's image of a club for aging
ex-Communist functionaries and easterners who feel like
second-class citizens in united Germany.
	   In the last election in 1994, the former Communists, known as
the Party of Democratic Socialism, won about 20 percent of the vote
in eastern Germany. In the west, it got 0.9 percent.
	   Now, eight years after East Germany ceased to exist, the PDS
realizes it must modernize its image. ``Western votes are crucial
to our continued existence,'' says PDS campaign manager Andre Brie.
	   After years of being treated as a pariah, the ex-Communists say
an improved showing in the upcoming election could force other
parties to take it more seriously.
	   Front runner Gerhard Schroeder, a business-minded board member
of Volkswagen, has moved his left-leaning Social Democrats toward
the political center in his campaign, possibly making the PDS more
attractive to traditional leftist voters.
	   The party also has committed itself to a democratic system and
toned-down rhetoric against capitalistic practices, although it
still advocates government-run businesses.
	   With membership down by half since 1990 to less than 100,000,
often because of deaths, it badly needs new, young blood.
	   Headlining the party's campaign is Gregor Gysi, a witty and
pugnacious former East Berlin attorney who led the renamed
Communists in 1990 for a few months between the fall of the Berlin
Wall and German unification.
	   Now the party's leader in parliament, he is battling allegations
by fellow lawmakers that he was a spy for the Stasi, East Germany's
dreaded secret police.
	   So far, the allegation has not alienated supporters, including
130 German intellectuals who signed an ad backing Gysi in major
newspapers this week. One of the signers was film director Volker
Schloendorff, maker of the 1979 Oscar-winning film ``The Tin
Drum.''
	   At a rally Tuesday night a few subway stops from the skyscrapers
of Frankfurt's banking district, Gysi outlined his strategy to an
appreciative crowd of nearly 1,000.
	   Much of his speech was universal left-wing rhetoric, including
calls for higher taxes on the rich and a ban on weapons exports.
Only in passing did Gysi demand equal status for east Germans, who
still have a lower living standard than their western compatriots.
	   To appeal to the westerns, the ex-Communists have been
trumpeting remorse about their unsavory history.
	   Last month, the party apologized for East Germany's role in the
Soviet-led crushing of the Prague Spring communist reform movement
in Czechoslovakia 30 years ago. The PDS also accepted ``moral
responsibility'' for ``wrongdoing'' by the East German regime of
its predecessor, the Socialist Unity Party.
	   Not everyone who heard Gysi was convinced.
	   ``His positions are OK, but I'm just not clear about the party's
relationship to the past,'' said Joerg Muncke, a 33-year-old
mathematician. ``That will probably keep me from voting for them.''

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dow industrials fell as much as 345 points
Thursday as the glimmer of hope that energized the stock market
just days ago was swept away by another wave of anxiety over the
crises in Washington and the global economy.
	   Bargain hunters moved in just as the market neared the low point
of last week's plunge, providing a late bounce. The Dow Jones
industrial average finished 249.48 points lower at 7,615.54, more
than 1,700 points, or 18.4 percent, below the July 17 record of
9,337.97.
	   The drop, combined with Wednesday's 155-point loss, more than
wiped out the record 380 points that the Dow gained on Tuesday amid
hopes the Federal Reserve may intervene in the battle against
economic distress spreading around the world.
	   It was the fifth time in just 10 sessions that the Dow has
whipsawed more than 300 points in a day, including the 512-plunge
on Aug. 31.
	   ``It was an emotional day and a pretty ugly day, and there's no
question that negative psychology is in play,'' said Robert
Freedman, chief investment officer for the John Hancock Funds in
Boston, discounting the impact of any particular development as the
cause of Thursday's slide.
	   In fact, although the threat of impeachment proceedings against
President Bill Clinton seemed to heighten with news that House
Republicans will release 445 pages of Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr's report on Friday, not all of Thursday's news was
discouraging.
	   In Russia, the ruble and stock market rebounded as a political
crisis neared resolution with President Boris Yeltsin's decision to
nominate a compromise candidate for prime minister who is expected
to win easy approval in parliament.
	   ``I don't think the main reason for the selling today was the
Starr report, but it didn't help,'' said Freedman. ``The main
concern is still earnings for U.S. companies, especially since the
recession overseas seems to be spreading to Latin America, which we
do more business with than the Far East and Russia.''
	   Broader stock indexes also tumbled Thursday, joining in yet
another global selloff highlighted by two trading halts in Brazil,
where the main stock index plunged 15 percent. In Europe,
Frankfurt's DAX index fell 5.8 percent, London's FT-SE 100 fell 3.3
percent, and the CAC-40 in Paris fell 4.6 percent.
	   Among other leading indexes, the Standard and Poor's 500 fell
26.01 to 980.19, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index
fell 39.22 to 1,585.33.
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-1 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume came to a
blistering 1.032 billion shares, up sharply from Wednesday's tally
of 919.69 million.
	   The NYSE composite index fell 12.80 to 487.77, and the American
Stock Exchange composite index fell 7.21 to 606.23.
	   In Tokyo, the Nikkei stock average fell 0.6 percent as an
interest rate cut by Japan's central bank did little ease worries
about the political statement over measures to repair the nation's
debt-crippled banking system.
	   The worldwide rush out of stocks produced another surge of
buying in the market for U.S. Treasury bonds, a traditional haven
for investors in times of uncertainty.
	   The bond rally pushed the yield on 30-year Treasury bills _ a
key influence on mortgage rates and other borrowing costs _ to
another all-time low of 5.20 percent.

All eyes on Bavarian election for clues to national mood
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Voters in the southern state of Bavaria
elect a new state legislature Sunday in what's being viewed as an
important test of political sentiment just two weeks before
national elections.
	   Polls indicate Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Bavarian allies, the
Christian Social Union (CSU), should hold on to the majority they
have enjoyed in the Alpine state's legislature since 1962.
	   But any slippage in support for the conservative party _ and
gains by the opposition Social Democrats or small far-right parties
_ will be analyzed for clues to how the nation will vote for
chancellor on Sept. 27.
	   ``There won't be any change of government in Bavaria,'' Munich
Mayor Christian Ude, a Social Democrat, said in a recent interview.
``The question is, `Where is the trend going?'''
	   Kohl's coalition government includes his Christian Democrats
(CDU), the Bavaria-only sister party CSU and the tiny, pro-market
Free Democrats.
	   The CSU's main candidate in Bavaria, Gov. Edmund Stoiber, has
said he hopes the Bavarian vote will give ``a jump start'' to the
CDU-CSU partnership.
	   But recognizing the dissatisfaction many voters feel with Kohl
after nearly 16 years in office, Stoiber also has sought to
distance himself from the chancellor, avoiding any mention of him
in stump speeches.
	   Instead, Stoiber blasts away at the Social Democratic Party's
popular federal chancellor candidate, Gerhard Schroeder, who has
been criss-crossing the state with his Bavarian-born wife.
	   While the Social Democrats never claimed they can win the
Bavarian poll, a gain of two or three percentage points from the 30
percent the party achieved in 1994 would be widely viewed as a
strong showing.
	   Stoiber, meanwhile, says a good result for the CSU would be ``50
percent plus X,'' compared to the 52.8 percent the party got in
1994.
	   Both sides, though, sought to attack the other's
interpretations.
	   On German television Wednesday night, Social Democratic party
chairman Oskar Lafontaine said 50.1 percent for the CSU ``won't be
a victory, it'll be a defeat,'' compared to the 1994 results.
	   On the same program, CSU chairman and Kohl's finance minister,
Theo Waigel, said the Social Democrats were running scared and
substantially lowering expectations of gains.
	   The residual worry, though, is that the extreme right as much as
the leftist Social Democrats will gain from the perceived failures
of the federal government.
	   Several tiny conservative parties are running, including the
far-right Republican Party. Latest polls put support for the
Republicans at only 3 percent among Bavarian voters, but recent
experience shows that far-right voters have a knack for surprises.
	   In April, the far-right German People's Union leapt from nowhere
to take about 13 percent of the vote in state elections in
Saxony-Anhalt.

Stocks plunge, dollar lower in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks fell sharply in early trading Friday
following a steep overnight fall on Wall Street. The U.S. dollar
declined against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 405.79 points, or 2.77
percent, to 14,260.24 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On
Thursday, the index had fallen 89.51 points, or 0.61 percent.
	   Share prices were lower across the board as the overnight plunge
in New York renewed concerns over the condition of the U.S.
economy, traders said.
	   In New York Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled
249.48 points to 7,615.54, its sixth-worst point-loss, amid
earnings worries and fears that U.S. President Bill Clinton may be
forced to resign or be impeached.
	   Investors are also concerned by the plunge in stock prices
across Latin America, traders said. The Brazilian market Thursday
recorded its steepest fall in one session since 1990, with the Sao
Paulo Stock Exchange's Bovespa Index plunging 15.8 percent.
	   ``The Tokyo market is being affected by the fall in stock
markets around the world,'' said Yasuo Ueki, general manager at
Nikko Securities.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 21.52 points, or 1.94 percent, to 1,088.39.
The TOPIX had lost 6.10 points, or 0.55 percent, the previous day.
	   In foreign exchange trading, concerns over the U.S. economy and
Clinton's escalating problems weighed heavily on the dollar,
traders said.
	   The dollar bought 133.76 yen in early trading, down 1.94 yen
from late Thursday trading in Tokyo and also below its late New
York level of 134.23 yen overnight.
	   The yield on the No. 182 10-year Japanese government bond
dropped to a new record low of 0.810 percent from Wednesday's
finish of 0.840 percent, driving its price up to 114.50 yen from
114.27 yen. The previous record-low yield was 0.995 percent on
Sept. 1.

Strategy issues to dominate in European central bankers' meeting

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The inner circle of Europe's new
central bank face an unenviable task: formulating a financial
policy for the new year while the world economy shows no sign of
stabilizing.
	   Analysts were not expecting European Central Bank president, Wim
Duisenberg of the Netherlands, to announce any major strategy
decisions at the end of Friday's governing council meeting.
	   The ECB was set up in June. Its governing council comprises the
central bank chiefs of the 11 countries in the monetary merger:
Germany, France, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Austria, the
Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium and Finland.
	   Four EU members are staying out of the currency union, at least
for now: Britain, Denmark, Sweden and Greece.
	   Starting Jan. 1, the bank is to set financial policy for the 11
European Union members that are joining to launch the single
currency, called the euro.
	   Yet with instability in the world economy caused by Russia's
crisis, Asia's recession and weakness in Latin America, caution is
in the air. Economists say the strategy issue is too important to
be rushed.
	   The question is whether to run financial strategy based on money
supply data or inflation data, with arguments over which is the
more reliable tool for tracking how the economy is performing.
Financial markets are keen for an answer.
	   ``There could be nothing worse than the bank having to say, in a
year or so, that they didn't choose the right way of doing it, and
having to change,'' hurting confidence in the new currency, said
Gerhard Greber, an economist at Frankfurt's Bank Julius Baer.
	   Central bankers also will likely talk about slipping growth in
Europe. U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said last week
the U.S. economy was increasingly prey to global turmoil, and some
are asking whether Europe is too.
	   France this week cut its growth estimate for 1999 by 0.1 percent
to 2.7 percent, and Italy dramatically cut its forecast for this
year from 2.5 to 2 percent.
	   Germany's economy grew a slight 0.1 percent in the second
quarter.
	   Falling growth could cause the central bank early problems as
countries use reserves to fund their annual budgets. Under the
terms of monetary union, they are obliged to balance budgets or run
a surplus.

Central bank report says consumer mood increasingly gloomy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Income tax cuts have failed to boost consumer
spending, and consumers remain gloomy about the prospects for the
future, according to a Bank of Japan report released Friday.
	   In its monthly economic report, Japan's central bank said
private consumption isn't showing signs of recovery despite the
implementation of special income tax cuts this summer.
	   It said decline in company spending and production have cut into
profits and that in turn is creating a decline in employee income.
	   ``Employment and income conditions have deteriorated further,''
it said.
	   With the severe income and employment conditions, the Bank of
Japan said, consumer sentiment is turning even more cautious.
	   ``Japan's economic conditions continue to deteriorate,'' the
report said, adding that the weak consumption and demand are
keeping wholesale prices on a downtrend and consumer prices below
the previous year's level.
	   The Bank of Japan report said the effects from the government's
comprehensive economic stimulus package announced in April are
expected to gradually put a brake to a further deterioration of the
economy.
	   But the shrinkage of production, income and expenditure have
pushed overall economic activities to considerably low levels, and
``the economy is unlikely to transition immediately to a
self-sustained recovery led by private demand,'' it said.
	   The central bank also cited the additional risk factor to the
economy from recent financial market volatility triggered by the
political and economic crisis in Russia.

Foreigners call the shots in post-war Bosnia

	   BRCKO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ What do you call a place where
foreigners run elections and foreign troops patrol daily? Where
menu prices are in a foreign currency, and even the flag and
license plates are chosen by foreigners?
	   One answer is a colony. Another is Bosnia-Herzegovina.
	   Three years after the Dayton peace accord ended the 1992-1995
ethnic conflict, Bosnia resembles an occupied territory. A special
European envoy wields near-absolute power, imposing decisions on
elected leaders unable to agree on much due to hatred and mistrust
left over from the war.
	   More than 30,000 troops, mostly from the United States and
Europe, keep the peace. The German mark trades freely.
	   ``Bosnia-Herzegovina is the first international colony in
history,'' said Zeljko Ivankovic, a Sarajevo writer and
philosopher.
	   Elections this weekend to choose leaders for the complex,
ethnic-based political system are supervised by the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has already
disqualified some candidates for election rules violations.
	   But most people here agree that for now, Bosnians need help to
fix what they themselves broke.
	   ``Without international help, they could never rebuild this
place,'' muttered Dusan Petrovic, a Serb refugee living in a house
owned by a displaced Muslim in Brcko.
	   International officials are clear about their motives _
instability in Bosnia threatens all of central Europe. The huge
cost of personnel, military might and aid _ no one offers a figure
but it must be millions of dollars a day _ is worth the effort,
they say.
	   ``We have a major investment in Europe and destabilization here
is in no one's best interest,'' said Jacques Paul Klein, the
American chief deputy to Carlos Westendorp, the European overseer
of Bosnia.
	   The international commitment appears long term. At Camp McGovern
near Brcko, workers are erecting wooden barracks for the 1,000 U.S.
soldiers who formerly lived in tents. A recreation area has an
Anthony's pizzeria and a Fiddler's Green tavern.
	   ``I don't think we're going to leave anytime soon,'' said
Gunnery Sgt. Jose Piedra, 35, of the 3rd Civil Affairs Group from
Camp Pendleton in California.
	   Klein cites accomplishments such as the political emasculation
of Bosnian Serb extremists who launched the war in 1992 in a bid to
create a purely Serb state.
	   But he still calls Bosnia a ``patient on life-support'' and
acknowledges it could take 50 to 100 years to build a viable Muslim
majority state as a bridge between Europe and the Middle East.
	   ``No one here is naive,'' Klein said. ``We're not going to
recreate prewar Bosnia. That society is forever shattered.''
	   Bosnia's multi-layered government system includes a three-member
presidency _ one Muslim, one Croat, one Serb _ and a national
parliament, along with separate legislatures in each of two
entities: one Serb and the other a Muslim-Croat federation.
	   After elections in 1996, little was achieved because the ethnic
wartime leaders who won rarely agreed on anything. The
international community then allowed Westendorp to impose decisions
when the three-member presidency deadlocked.
	   That has happened regularly, even on issues as routine as new
license plates. The old plates showed what ethnic area a vehicle
came from, which discouraged free movement by making drivers
vulnerable to harassment in areas controlled by rival groups.
	   Klein told how Momcilo Krajisnik, the Bosnian Serb member of the
presidency, opposed the new plates because the lettering was not in
the Cyrillic alphabet used by Serbs. It was pointed out the six
letters chosen _ J, K, T, M, E and A _ were the same in both the
Cyrillic and Roman alphabets.
	   ``I thought he was going to choke, because we had him,'' Klein
chuckled.

Roundup of Cuban dissidents seen as a warning
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to CLARIFY that political freedom has
increased slightly since pope's visit. &QL; 
 &UR; By KEN GUGGENHEIM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ The arrest of at least 13 dissidents this week
shows that political freedom still lags behind newly allowed
religious liberties in communist Cuba, a top human rights activist
said.
	   The dissidents were arrested on Monday and Tuesday and held for
a day or two before being released without charges, said Elizardo
Sanchez, head of the Cuban Commission of Human Rights and National
Reconciliation.
	   Eight of those arrested had been involved in a small, but
unusually bold protest last month outside a court where another
dissident was being sentenced, he said. About 30 protesters had
chanted ``Down with the government'' and ``Down with Castro,''
Sanchez said in an interview Thursday.
	   He said the government of Fidel Castro apparently was trying to
prevent the dissidents from protesting at a Roman Catholic
religious procession on Tuesday. Another group of about 30 people
was prevented from leaving a house to join the procession, Sanchez
said.
	   The procession on Havana streets was a sign of the new religious
freedoms enjoyed by Cubans since a visit by Pope John Paul II in
January.
	   But the arrests showed the ``dual policy'' of the Cuban
government, extending religious freedoms while keeping tight reins
on the political opposition, Sanchez said.
	   He said the arrests were aimed at punishing those who protested
when Reinaldo Alfaro Garcia was sentenced to three years in prison
for allegedly providing false information critical of Cuba to the
United States' Radio Marti.
	   The Cuban government has made no announcements about the arrests
and a Cuban Foreign Ministry spokesman said at a news conference
that he knew nothing about them.
	   ``As far as I know, nobody has been arrested for anything
related to the trial of the counterrevolutionary Alfaro,''
Alejandro Gonzalez said.
	   For years, the government and Cuban dissidents had been locked
in a spiral in which protests led to greater repression, which in
turn triggered more protests, Sanchez said.
	   Since the pope's visit, the Cuban government has reduced the
repression, relying on brief detentions and police visits instead
of arrests, he said. That has led to fewer protests.
	   The demonstration outside the Alfaro sentencing was the largest
since the pope's visit and the arrests of the dissidents was the
government's greatest crackdown since then, he said.

Mitsubishi group firms to link up in investment-trust market
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with confirmation, ADDS comment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and the three other
finance companies of the Mitsubishi group will jointly form an
investment trust company, company officials said Friday.
	   Tokyo-Mitsubishi, one of Japan's largest banks, will link up
with Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp., Meiji Life Insurance Co.
and Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Co.
	   The alliance is intended to strengthen the four companies ahead
of increased competition as Japan's ``Big Bang'' deregulation
measures lower the barriers dividing banking, insurance and
securities brokerage.
	   It will also step up the pressure on competitors to restructure
and pursue similar deals.
	   Company officials, who briefed reporters Friday, said the group
plans to set up the jointly owned investment-trust company in
December. The four firms, which have operated independently up to
now, are also considering an alliance in investment banking.
	   They denied reports that they are also considering an alliance
in the insurance business.
	   The alliance can be regarded as a step forward for the Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi, as it will reinforce the bank's investment trust
and pension businesses, said Katsuhito Sasajima, a Nikko Research
Center analyst.
	   A full entry into investment banking operations, including stock
brokering, should be the bank's next step, he said.

	   ISTINIC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Despite new international calls for
Serb leaders to halt their attacks in Kosovo, many ethnic Albanian
refugees in the embattled region are losing hope.
	   Zenia Krasniqi said she is fed up with running from Serbian
attacks.
	   ``This is what we sleep on,'' the elderly woman said as she
pointed to a rain-soaked field, her third place of refuge since
twice fleeing Serb attacks. ``I will die here even if I have to
hang msyelf from this tree.''
	   Mrs. Krasniqi is among an estimated 25,000 ethnic Albanians
camped around this southwestern Kosovo village, where they sought
refuge from Serb-led Yugoslav forces seeking to destroy the
secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The rebel army is seeking independence from Serbia, the dominant
republic in Yugoslavia.
	   U.N. officials, including Undersecretary-General Olara Otunnu,
planned to visit the refugees Friday. They hope their presence will
discourage police from arresting males suspected of links to the
KLA.
	   For now, Serb forces appear to have halted their advance, which
drove ethnic Albanians from their homes and farms into a huge
encampment around this village 75 kilometers (45 miles) southwest
of the provincial capital, Pristina.
	   Carloads of armed Serb police, some escorting Western diplomatic
observers, cruised back and forth on the road past the refugees,
provoking curses as well as instilling fear.
	   ``Police beat six young guys right here an hour ago with
sticks,'' said a middle-aged teacher who was standing on a dirt
road through the camp.
	   Parked tractors stretched for more than two kilometers (one
mile) from the center of the village, hooked to trailers piled high
with hurriedly gathered clothes and belongings.
	   Until this week's attacks, the Istinic area was one of the last
strongholds of the KLA.
	   Rrok Berisha, a member of Kosovo's unauthorized ethnic Albanian
parliament, said most of the refugees fled 40 nearby villages
shelled by police in the past few days.
	   Berisha said he feared 100,000 refugees could stream into the
area as more villages are cleared. Kosovo's population is 90
percent ethnic Albanian, most of whom back the rebels' armed
struggle.
	   Refugees said they feared police soon would begin rounding up
men of fighting age on suspicion they had fought in the KLA. A
village elder in Istinic said about 40 men and women injured by
shelling fled into the hills Wednesday, fearing arrest.
	   In Belgrade, chief Yugoslav prosecutor Vukasin Jokanovic
declared that Serb troops had crushed the rebels and arrested ``a
large number'' of them. Jankovic said many ``terrorists'' would
soon face trial for ``terrorism and conspiracy against the state.''
	   In New York, the U.N. Security Council issued yet another appeal
Thursday to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to ``halt to all
repressive actions against the civilian population.''
	   ``There is a view among council members that there is a need to
return to this rather urgently,'' Council President Hans Dahlgren
of Sweden said. ``But there is, as everyone knows, disagreement on
what practical steps there could be consensus on in the council.''
	   John Shattuck, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Human
Rights, warned again Thursday that Kosovo is headed for a
humanitarian catastrophe as the harsh Balkan winter approaches.
	   ``Massive human rights violations are occurring,'' he said in
The Hague, Netherlands. ``Actions are being taken against large
numbers of civilians. Homes have been destroyed by shelling.''
	   Kosovo fighting already has created an estimated 265,000
refugees. Western officials fear the worst if urgent help isn't
provided for the 50,000 or so living in the hills and forests,
especially with the arrival of winter in about six weeks.

Sampras-Rafter match should be showcase of tame U.S. Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be UPDATED after Philippoussis-Johansson match &QL; 
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Pete Sampras stands on the cusp of history at
the U.S. Open. Patrick Rafter, the defending champion, stands in
his way.
	   In what promises to be the showcase match of a tame tournament
that so far has provided few surprises or dramatic battles, Sampras
and Rafter meet in a men's semifinal that will have the feel of a
final.
	   The last 11 days have seemed little more than a setup for
Saturday's match, which features two of the best
serve-and-volleyers of their generation. It pits the hottest
players in men's tennis against each other.
	   And it could provide revenge for Sampras _ not only against an
opponent who defeated him a month ago in Cincinnati, but also
against critics who had written him off as an over-the-hill
champion.
	   ``It's time, this is the U.S. Open, this is the big moment of
the year for me,'' Sampras said. ``This is what the year boils down
to for me.''
	   The other men's semifinal was being set Thursday.
	   No. 10 Carlos Moya made just 15 unforced errors in a 6-4, 6-3,
6-3 win over Magnus Larsson of Sweden that lasted 90 minutes. Moya
faced only one break point in the match, and never lost his serve.
	   Moya, who won this year's French Open and was a finalist at the
Australian Open, will face the winner of Thursday night's
quarterfinal between Mark Philippoussis and Thomas Johansson.
	   Until this year, Moya was known mostly as a clay-court player.
the Spaniard's results at the Australian and U.S. Opens show how he
has developed into a top player on all surfaces.
	   ``I grew up on clay, so I think I'm always going to have the
game on clay,'' Moya said. ``If you ask me right now, I prefer
hard. If you ask me two weeks ago, I prefer clay.''
	   The women's semifinals are set for Friday, with top-seeded
Martina Hingis of Switzerland facing No. 3 Jana Novotna of the
Czech Republic and an all-American match between No. 2 Lindsay
Davenport and No. 5 Venus Williams.
	   When Sampras lost in the second round of the French Open in late
May, the whispers about the end of his reign atop men's tennis
became louder. His stretch as No. 1 briefly had been broken earlier
in the year by Marcelo Rios, and Sampras appeared vulnerable for
the first time in years.
	   But he won a record-tying fifth Wimbledon title in July, and now
is within two victories of two more records _ Jimmy Connors' mark
of five U.S. Open titles and Roy Emerson's record of 12 Grand Slam
singles titles.
	   Sampras, who will remain No. 1 in the world no matter what
happens the rest of this tournament, has not lost in a Grand Slam
semifinal since 1996 at Wimbledon.
	   Rafter had lost eight straight times to Sampras before beating
him in the final of an ATP Tour event in Cincinnati in mid-August,
a match that ended with a disputed call. Rafter's serve was called
out, but the umpire overruled the call to give Rafter the ace and
the match.
	   Sampras stood at the baseline for several seconds, making the
victorious Rafter wait at the net, and then refused to shake the
umpire's hand.
	   Rafter said that win will change his attitude heading into
Saturday's semifinal.
	   ``I won't go on the court feeling as intimidated as I had
before,'' he said. ``But Pete is a different kettle of fish
altogether. I had a great win last year. He's done it for the last
six years.''
	   Rafter, whose speed will be pitted against Sampras' power, had
to rally from a two-set deficit in the first round of this year's
U.S. Open against Hicham Arazi. Since then, he's dropped just one
set in four matches.
	   Rafter is trying to become the sixth man of the Open Era to
successfully defend a U.S. Open singles title. That's an
accomplishment that would impress even Sampras.
	   ``That's really a true sign for me on how I look at a player, is
winning a major if you can come back and do it again,'' Sampras
said. ``That is the toughest thing to do in sports.''

US: CLINTONS - Despite the Starr report, it's business as usual for
President Bill Clinton - we show him and Hillary, out and about together

Former Guatemalan guerrillas freed in Guatemala after prison in

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A judge has freed seven former guerrillas
who spent six years in Mexican prisons and were transferred to
Guatemala in July to serve out their terms.
	   Judge Juan Fernando Godinez Cuellar granted amnesty to the
former guerrillas under peace accords that ended Guatemala's
36-year civil war in December 1996, court president Jose Felipe
Licona said Thursday.
	   Even as guerrillas in Guatemala were freed and disarmed, the
seven rebels remained behind bars in Mexico.
	   They were arrested on Oct. 3, 1992, by Mexican soldiers as they
transported a heavy weapon in Mexico's southern state of Chiapas,
which borders Guatemala. They were sentenced to prison terms
ranging from 10 to 17 years for weapons violations.
	   On July 10, they were flown to Guatemala, where they were to
serve out their terms. The prisoners had said they hoped to be
freed soon under the amnesty law.

Wherever McGwire goes, adoring crowds follow

	   CINCINNATI (AP) _ Right now, the new home run king is also the
King of the Road.
	   For Mark McGwire, wherever he goes, the rest of the season is
shaping up as one extended victory lap. A day after McGwire hit No.
62, the St. Louis Cardinals left for a five-game trip to Cincinnati
and Houston.
	   If anything, the celebration picked up even more steam.
	   ``That's a fun way to play,'' the Reds' Bret Boone said after
McGwire livened up another otherwise woeful season at sold-out
Cinergy Field Wednesday night. ``You know everybody's here for one
thing.
	   ``You can't draw 50,000 people every night, but it's a thrill
when it happens.''
	   It would be tough to top the 11-minute lovefest that brought the
game to a temporary halt following McGwire's record-breaker on
Tuesday night in St. Louis. But the fans in Cinergy Field tried.
Oh, they tried.
	   The cheering was so intense when McGwire faced Pete Harnisch in
the first inning Wednesday night, he had to step out of the
batter's box three times. Each time he waved to the crowd and
tipped his cap, before the ovation finally subsided and the game
could continue.
	   ``It kept getting louder and louder,'' McGwire said. ``It's
absolutely incredible, the reception.
	   ``You never really put yourself in these situations, so you
don't know how to react.''
	   Don't expect anything less in Houston, where the Cardinals begin
a three-game series that'll magically boost attendance for the NL
Central leaders just as they have at every other stop. The same
goes for Milwaukee, where the Cardinals will play their final road
games Sept. 18-20.
	   ``Nobody's broken the home run record in the last 37 years,''
said catcher Tom Lampkin, one of McGwire's closest friends on the
team. ``Yeah, you cheer for your home guy, but you've got to cheer
for somebody who's done something like that.''
	   On Wednesday, the Reds had their first weekday, non-opening day
sellout since Pete Rose got his record-breaking 4,192nd hit in
1985.
	   Thursday was a repeat with the bonus of a McGwire batting
practice session that attracted about 10,000 early birds _ most of
them packing the left-field stands _ as McGwire hit nine homers in
17 swings.
	   In the right field stands, where McGwire has zero homers this
year, one on Wednesday read ``Swing Late.'' In the power alley,
there was ``Caution, Hard Hat Area,'' ``Way To Go Mark, Hit It
Here'' and ``Thanks For Saving Baseball, Mark.''

Courier, Martin picked for Davis Cup

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ An ailing Jim Courier and veteran Todd Martin
will be joined by two rookies on a weak U.S. team for this month's
Davis Cup semifinals against Italy.
	   Tom Gullikson, the U.S. Davis Cup captain, announced the lineup
Thursday for the series in Milwaukee Sept. 25-27. The lineup also
included Justin Gimelstob and Jan-Michael Gambill.
	   The United States has won the Davis Cup 31 times. If the
Americans beat Italy, they will play the winner of the Sweden-Spain
semifinal.
	   Top-ranked Pete Sampras and No. 8 Andre Agassi said they wanted
no part of the Davis Cup semis, citing reasons ranging from lack of
public response to conflicts with other events. Gullikson said
Sampras, going for a record-tying 12th Grand Sam singles title at
the U.S. Open, was ``focused on individual goals. Also, he's a
strong proponent of creating an offseason for himself.''
	   Courier, the world's No. 1 player in 1992 but now 70th, has
missed the last three tournaments on the ATP Tour with what's
officially listed as a ``dead arm''.
	   ``In the last couple years, his body has broken down and he has
had to back off training, and he's also not playing up to the
standard he has had in his career,'' Gullikson said. ``But we have
seen examples in the Davis Cup _ he has played top 10 tennis.''
	   Gullikson said Courier is training and ``very eager to get back
on a tennis court again.
	   Courier's Davis Cup record is 15-9, and the United States is
12-0 in series he has played. He rallied to win in five sets over
Marat Safin of Russia in the first round in Atlanta.
	   ``The Davis Cup and the Grand Slams are the two reasons I get up
every morning and strap on my shoes and practice,'' Courier said.
	   Martin is ranked 27th, the only one of the quartet better than
No. 50. The average ranking on the U.S. team is 60.
	   ``Rankings don't concern me,'' Gullikson said. ``What concerns
me is to get three points in Milwaukee. In Davis Cup, rankings
don't mean much. I've seen lower-ranked players play inspirational
tennis for their country.''
	   Gullikson is counting on Martin.
	   ``Todd can play singles and-or doubles. He's 9-2 in Davis Cup
singles for us since I've been captain,'' Gullikson said. ``Todd
has been an integral part of our team every time he's been asked.''
	   Gambill is ranked 57th, moving up from No. 176 at the start of
the year with victories over Agassi and Courier on his way to the
semifinals at the Indian Wells, California, tournament in March. He
reached the third round of the U.S. Open, losing to French Open
champion Carlos Moya in a fifth-set tiebreaker.
	   Gimelstob, No. 89, won the mixed doubles titles at the
Australian and French Opens with Venus Williams.

Steinhauer shoots 65 for first-round lead, Pak third
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KENT, Washington (AP) _ Sherri Steinhauer shot a 7-under-par 65,
one stroke off her career best, to lead Penny Hammel by a stroke
after the opening round of the Safeco Classic on Thursday.
	   South Korean rookie sensation Se Ri Pak shot a 5-under-par 67,
two shots off the pace, as she began a bid for her fifth tournament
title of the year.
	   Steinhauer had seven birdies and no bogeys over the 6,241-yard
(5,705- meter), par-72 Meridian Valley Country Club course to come
within a shot of the 64 she shot in this event in 1990.
	   Pak, second on the LPGA money list, had five birdies and no
bogeys in her round. Money leader Annika Sorenstam shot a 68 and
was tied with Pat Hurst.
	   Sweden's Sorenstam, who finished second to Karrie Webb by a shot
here last year, was 5-under after nine holes thanks to an eagle on
No. 9, but had two bogeys on the back nine.
	   Webb, winner of the two straight Safecos, shot a 71. Webb had a
33 on the front nine but made a double bogey on the 11th hole and
bogeys on Nos. 16 and 17.
	   Steinhauer, named to the U.S. Solheim Cup team by team captain
Judy Rankin, had four straight birdies on Nos. 11-14.
	   She sank a 60-foot (18-meter) birdie putt from the front of the
green on No. 16 to move to 7-under. She parred the last two holes.
	   Steinhauer won the Women's British Open last month, gaining her
third victory in 13 pro seasons despite opening that event with an
81.
	   She struggled last week, missing the cut in the Safeway LPGA
Golf Championship.
	   Thursday was a different story, however, as she hit all 18
greens in regulation and played bogey-free golf.
	   Hammel took an unorthodox route to the top of the leader board
with nine birdies and three bogeys.
	   Hammel, 39th on the money list, made a 30-foot (9-meter) putt
for birdie on No. 2, but had consecutive bogeys on the fifth and
sixth holes. Birdies on Nos. 8 and 9 put her at 1-under.
	   Hammel, with four victories in 14 years on the tour, finished
her round with six birdies and a bogey on the back nine.
	   The Safeco winner will take home dlrs 90,000.

Nine injured in emergency jetliner landing in Shanghai
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Nine passengers were injured when a
Chinese jetliner taking off from Shanghai for Beijing made an
emergency landing after its landing gear jammed, an airport
official said Friday.
	   The China Eastern Airlines plane, a McDonnell Douglas MD-11, had
137 passengers aboard when it returned to Hongqiao International
Airport shortly after 11 p.m. on Thursday, said the official.
	   None of the passengers was seriously injured, according to the
official, who would not give his name.
	   The cause of the incident is under investigation, according to a
bureau official who gave his name as Mr. Liu. He would not say
whether any foreigners were involved, and would not give any other
information.
	   China Eastern declined comment.
	   City leaders including Mayor Xu Kuangdi and Huang Ju, Shanghai
secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, went to the airport to
comfort the passengers, the Wen Hui Bao newspaper reported.

Rains hampering aid flights to flooding victims in southern Mexico
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to raise official death toll to 45, UPDATE
with quote from president &QL;

 &UR; By ALEJANDRO RUIZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) _ Victims of widespread flooding in
southern Mexico have appealed for food and drinking water, and
unconfirmed reports indicated the death toll could soar as rescue
workers reach towns cut off by the deluge.
	   ``Children are crying because they haven't brought anything to
eat,'' one man angrily told a military officer Thursday at the
Tapachula Country Club, where 250 people sought shelter.
	   But the tragedy may be much greater along a 100-mile
(160-kilometer) stretch of coastline northwest of Tapachula, where
cut roads and bridges and heavy rains have made it impossible for
rescue workers to operate.
	   A government shortwave radio operator in the town of Acapetagua,
60 miles (100 kilometers) northwest of Tapachula, told military
officers in Tapachula on Thursday that 100 bodies were floating in
a lagoon nearby, The Associated Press has learned.
	   ``There are more than 100,'' the operator said in a recording
obtained by the AP. ``The sea has them. They're floating in the
lagoon.''
	   She said villagers had pulled two bodies from the lagoon, but a
strong current made it impossible to reach others.
	   The government has confirmed 45 deaths _ 31 in Chiapas and the
rest in other states _ after a week of steady rain _ nearly two
feet (0.6 meters) in some areas _ caused the worst flooding in half
a century. Sixty people are reported missing in Chiapas.
	   Five new deaths were reported Thursday by officials, who said
the bodies of two men, two women and a boy were pulled from waters
in Huixtla, just north of Tapachula. Huixtla's municipal secretary,
Emir Vargas Castro, said four of the bodies were buried immediately
and a wake was being held for the other.
	   The report from Acapetagua could not be confirmed, but
government officials have said that they expected the death toll to
rise dramatically once they reach towns affected by the flooding.
	   ``This is a tragedy of enormous proportions,'' President Ernesto
Zedillo said after a helicopter tour of the Chiapas disaster zone
on Thursday.
	   He said bad weather and damaged roads were making it
``particularly difficult to reach those places we'd like to be _
the communities where the people are beginning to have, or already
have, a shortage of drinking water.''
	   He said more than 20 helicopters were to arrive in Chiapas by
Friday to help relief teams reach isolated areas.
	   The muddy torrents turned streets into violent rivers, sweeping
away roads and bridges and tearing down walls from concrete houses.
	   Thousands have fled their homes. About 4,500 people sought
refuge in temporary shelters and 650,000 were left without electric
power.
	   Among the hardest towns was Pijijiapan, 50 miles (80 kilometers)
north of Tapachula, where at least 18 people died, including a
police officer who drowned during a rescue mission.
	   Most of Mexico was being pounded by storms off the Pacific and
Gulf coasts, and severe flooding was reported in many areas.
Forecasters predicted more rain for southern and eastern Mexico.
	   Seventeen ports along Mexico's two coasts were closed to small
craft and authorities suspended all fishing and ocean recreational
activities.
	   Soldiers were sent to Zihuatanejo, some 700 miles (1,100
kilometers) up the coast from Tapachula, to assist flood victims.
	   Flooding deaths were also reported in Guanajuato, Nayarit,
Jalisco and Oaxaca states.
	   The Red Cross appealed for donations and relief teams collected
bundles of supplies in Mexico City.
	   Rain continued to fall Thursday in Tapachula, a city of 250,000
people 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the Guatemala border, which
had received 22.5 inches (57 centimeters) of rain since Monday.
	   A military rescue worker, who identified himself as S. Camacho,
said relief efforts were being hurt by a shortage of fuel.
	   ``If the secretary of defense doesn't bring us food, we're going
to eat rocks,'' Camacho said.
	   The state gas company Pemex said the collapse of seven bridges
in Chiapas made it impossible to deliver fuel.

Kopeck gets her finger back but Welsh sickness halts brave

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Three days after losing the top of
her finger in a warmup game, Lauralee Kopeck was itching to get
back into action at the Commonwealth Games.
	   Then eight of her opponents fell sick with gastroenteritis and
the game was called off.
	   ``This kid hasn't winced, hasn't whined, hasn't complained,''
said Canada's team leader, Margie Schuett. ``She has her finger
taken off and goes right back out there and competes again.''
	   Well, she would have done.
	   Hours later, the Welsh team announced that four of its hockey
players were in hospital and four others were receiving treatment
for gastroenteritis.
	   It's the latest hiccup to hit the Commonwealth Games.
	   ``The first player was affected on Sunday and others have gone
down with it since,'' said Wales manager Margaret Edwards. ``The
rest of the team are fine.''
	   Welsh press officer Malcolm Stanners said the source of the
illness was yet to be discovered.
	   ``There's no evidence yet that it's food poisoning but the
authorities are investigating whether that is the case,'' Stanners
said.
	   The eight hope to be back in action Monday when the game is
rescheduled. They will face up to Kopeck and her reconstructed
finger.
	   Kopeck, whose nickname is Jumbo, warmed up with the Canadian
team before its 3-0 win over Namibia on Wednesday.
	   ``She was defending a short corner and an opponent smashed the
ball, it hit her little finger and sheared off the end of it,''
said team doctor Peter Fowler.
	   ``The doctor at the game saw the bone exposed and sent her to
our clinic at the village in an ambulance. After the game, they
found her finger on the field, brought it around and we sewed it
back on.''
	   The women's hockey games have been among several events being
staged before Friday's opening ceremony at the 100,000-capacity
Bukat Jalil National Stadium just outside downtown Kuala Lumpur.
	   Organizers hoped that went according to plan after a series of
unexpected changes to the sports events.
	   The rugby schedule had to be redrawn Thursday when Gambia and
Zimbabwe pulled out of the 7-a-side event, changing the structure
from five pools of four teams to six pools of three.
	   Organizers also had to consult the rule book when rain disrupted
two cricket matches for up to three hours.
	   The rain came with Northern Ireland struggling at 89 for five
against powerhouse South Africa. Because of the delay caused by the
downpour, organizers got out the calculators and set the South
Africans to make 131 which they did for the loss of six wickets
despite being 23 for four and 57 for five.
	   The rain also affected the Bangladesh-Barbados match and the
West Indians were set 160 to win, which they also achieved with
four wickets left.
	   World No. 1 squash player Peter Nicol of Scotland had no such
delays.
	   He brushed aside Guyana's Regan Pollard 9-0, 9-0, 9-1 in only 13
minutes.

North Korean special forces pose little threat to Japan: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's government has reportedly determined that
North Korean special military forces lack the equipment and
communication capabilities needed to pose a serious threat were
they to attempt an invasion.
	   Though North Korea has 80,000 to 100,000 ground and naval troops
as part of its special forces, they do not have the large ships
that would be needed to mount an invasion, according to an internal
government report seen by Japan's Kyodo news service.
	   The North would be forced to instead attempt to infiltrate Japan
on boats carrying only three or four soldiers each, and avoid such
heavily guarded areas as Japanese or U.S. military bases.
	   Likely targets, it said, would be commercial airports or oil
pipelines.
	   North Korea's military capabilities have been of particular
concern in Japan since the North fired a missile last week that
crossed over Japan's main island and crashed into the Pacific
Ocean.
	   The North claims the launch was to put a satellite in orbit, but
Japanese, American and South Korean defense officials believe it
was more likely a test of the North's new long range ballistic
missile.
	   They believe that missile has a long enough range to hit
virtually any target in Japan.
	   Kyodo said the report on the North's special forces was based on
intelligence obtained mainly from the United States military. It
said the report, dated July 31, was compiled after a North Korean
mini-submarine was captured by South Korea in June.
	   Kyodo said the report concluded that although the North's troops
are well disciplined, the threat from the special forces was ``not
that great'' because of their logistical weaknesses.
	   Defense Agency officials refused to comment Friday on the Kyodo
report, which was released on Thursday.

Japanese stock prices plunge, U.S. dollar falls
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Nikkei's morning close, midday trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices plunged almost across the
board Friday morning following a steep overnight fall on Wall
Street. The U.S. dollar fell against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 562.48 points, or 3.83
percent, moving to 14,103.55 at the end of the morning session. On
Thursday, the index had fallen 89.51 points, or 0.61 percent.
	   Stocks fell as the overnight plunge in New York renewed concerns
over the global economy and the condition of the U.S. economy,
traders said.
	   In New York Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled
249.48 points to 7,615.54, its sixth-worst point-loss, amid
earnings worries and fears that U.S. President Bill Clinton may be
forced to resign or be impeached.
	   Investors were also concerned by the plunge in stock prices
across Latin America, traders said. The Brazilian market Thursday
posted its steepest fall in one session since 1990, with the Sao
Paulo Stock Exchange's Bovespa Index plunging 15.8 percent.
	   ``The Tokyo market is being affected by the fall in stock
markets around the world,'' said Yasuo Ueki, general manager at
Nikko Securities.
	   Traders said some of the morning selling might be related to
Friday's special quotations to settle September futures and
options.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 30.53 points, or 2.75 percent, to 1,079.38.
The TOPIX closed down 6.10 points, or 0.55 percent, the previous
day.
	   In foreign exchange trading, concerns over the U.S. economy and
Clinton's escalating problems weighed heavily on the dollar,
traders said.
	   The dollar bought 134.41 yen in midday trading, down 1.29 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of
134.23 yen overnight.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond dropped to a new record low of 0.780 percent from Thursday's
finish of 0.840 percent, the previous record-low level. Its price
rose to 114.72 yen from Thursday's 114.27 yen.

Tentative deal reached between Air Canada and pilots
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: All figures in Canadian dollars &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Air Canada and its striking pilots reached a
tentative agreement Thursday night, ending a costly nine-day
strike.
	   Jean-Marc Belanger, chairman of the Air Canada Pilots
Association, wouldn't elaborate on the agreement but said, ``We
have a good deal, a fair deal. We have achieved a lot.''
	   Air Canada spokeswoman Priscille LeBlanc said the deal has to be
ratified by the pilots, a process that is expected to take two to
three days.
	   ``Once Air Canada pilots have ratified the agreement, the
airline will begin phasing in operations within 24 hours,'' she
said.
	   Negotiators on both sides had been working around-the-clock
since returning to the bargaining table Tuesday.
	   Salary seemed to be the toughest issue, with the pilots
demanding a 12 percent increase over two years and management
offering 9 percent.
	   The pilots earn an average of dlrs 100,000 a year.
	   LeBlanc argued earlier it would cost Air Canada dlrs 150 million
over five years if the airline agreed to the extra three percentage
points and if the raises were extended to all employees whose
contracts are up soon for renegotiation.
	   Contracts with four other unions representing the majority of
Air Canada's employees are all due to expire within the next 18
months.
	   Analysts estimate the strike, which began Sept. 2, cost
Montreal-based Air Canada about dlrs 13 million a day. The airline
normally carries about 60,000 passengers a day.

Marion Jones leads premier World Cup field
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHY CHENAULT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Marion Jones says sometimes
winning is too easy.
	   Take this year. After going undefeated in the women's 100-meter
and 200-meter sprints and long jump, the 22-year-old American often
struggles to find motivation.
	   ``I've had to find new ways to make sure I stay stimulated,''
Jones said. ``It kind of gets difficult sometimes going out to the
track and knowing that if I run a sub-10.90 (in the 100), 95
percent of the time I'm going to win the race.''
	   Sometimes trash-talking by rivals fires her up. Sometimes
inspiration comes from negative news reports. But at the World Cup
starting Friday, Jones has natural motivation _ her first chance to
compete at high altitude, a boost to athletes who rely on explosive
speed.
	   ``I'm hoping for very fast results,'' she said.
	   So are World Cup promoters and the rest of the premier field
that has won 16 Olympic gold medals and 34 World Championship
titles. They will compete at Johannesburg Stadium, which has a
reputation as a fast track at 5,000 feet (1,500 meters) above sea
level.
	   Athletes representing the United States, Africa, Europe, the
Americas, Oceania, Asia, and two European national squads will
compete in the three-day event. Britain and Germany compete in the
men's field, while Germany and Russia round out the women's
competition.
	   The World Cup offers dlrs 3.5 million in individual prize money,
with dlrs 100,000 for a world record.
	   The U.S. men's and women's teams pose the biggest threats to the
reigning champions _ the African men's team and the European
women's squad.
	   Jones and Kim Batten, world record-holder in the 400-meter
hurdles, lead the U.S. women. The U.S. men's team features Jerome
Young in the 400, Bryan Bronson in the 400-meter hurdles, pole
vaulter Jeff Hartwig and John Godina in the shot and discus.
	   The African men's contingent is led by 200-meter specialist
Frankie Fredericks of Namibia and Kenyan distance stars, including
Daniel Komen in the 5,000 meters and world record-holder Bernard
Barmasai in the 3,000-meter steeplechase.
	   Jones isn't predicting any world records in Johannesburg. Still,
she hopes to capitalize on the thin air to break the 10.7-second
barrier in the 100 and run under 21.76 seconds in the 200, which
would be a personal best.
	   ``That's if everything goes right,'' she said.
	   Her best times this year are 10.71 and 21.80.

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Air Canada and its striking pilots have reached
a tentative agreement to end a nine-day strike that grounded the
fleet of Canada's largest airline.
	   Ratification of the agreement, which was reached Thursday night,
by the 2,100 pilots is expected to take about three days. The
airline said its 500 daily flights are expected to resume next
Wednesday or Thursday.
	   Air Canada, which normally carries about 60,000 passengers a
day, lost an estimated dlrs 7 million U.S. daily during the strike.
	   Jean-Marc Belanger, chairman of the Air Canada Pilots
Association, wouldn't elaborate on the contents of the deal but
said ``I am a happy man tonight.''
	   ``We have a good deal, a fair deal. We have achieved a lot.''
	   Belanger said the labor dispute, which began Sept. 2, would not
have happened if management and the union had cooperated as they
did toward the end of the negotiations.
	   Negotiators on both sides had been working round the clock since
returning to the bargaining table Tuesday.
	   Salary was the toughest issue, with the pilots demanding a
12-percent increase over two years and management adamant that its
two-year offer of 9 percent was final.

Japan to postpone foreign minister's visit to Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's foreign minister said Friday he has
postponed a planned visit to Moscow at the request of the Russian
government because of the country's political crisis.
	   Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura told reporters that Russia
requested a postponement late Thursday because there will be no
Russian counterpart to meet him.
	   Komura was scheduled to visit Russia Sept. 13-16 to meet with
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov for talks on bilateral
and international issues.
	   But Russian President Boris Yeltsin nominated Primakov on
Thursday to be Russia's new prime minister after his previous
candidate, Viktor Chernomyrdin, was rejected twice by parliament.
	   Former Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's trip to Moscow
beginning Sept. 16 to meet with Yeltsin will go forward as
scheduled, Chief Cabinet Spokesman Hiromu Nonaka said.
	   Hashimoto, who resigned as premier in July, was appointed
special advisor of foreign affairs to his successor, Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Ruling party supporters fired guns,
threw rocks and swung clubs at vastly outnumbered opposition
protesters Friday as strongman Hun Sen shifted tactics to crush
growing calls for his ouster. At least one person was killed and
several wounded.
	   The deployment of plainclothes supporters instead of riot police
to attack the opposition came a day after King Norodom Sihanouk
appealed to the army and police to stop shooting and beating
peaceful protesters and Buddhist monks.
	   The week-long violence, the worst since Hun Sen deposed Prince
Norodom Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a bloody coup last year,
stems from disputes over Hun Sen's official victory in July 26
parliamentary elections. The oppostion rejects the results,
alleging massive fraud.
	   About 2,000 backers of Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's
Party, some who appeared to be soldiers in plainclothes and many
coming from pro-Hun Sen areas around Phnom Penh, gathered near the
Angkor-style Independence Monument.
	   ``We are looking for the losers,'' said one Hun Sen supporter,
Chan Lay, 42, who reeked of alcohol. He carried a club and a pistol
protruded from his shirt. ``They are the trouble-makers for us and
for the CPP.
	   They set out with bamboo clubs and firearms toward the gathering
point of 300 rival opposition protesters about six blocks away near
the U.S. Embassy and Ranariddh's home. The opposition, warned of
the advance of their rivals, started to move from the area.
	   Turning onto a side street, they were confronted by six security
guards from a seedy hotel who opened fire with pistols. At least
three men were taken to a clinic with gunshot wounds to their legs.
	   Opposition backers holed up overnight at a school meanwhile
pelted the pro-Hun Sen marchers with rocks as they passed.
	   The two groups finally clashed on a side street, which erupted
into a battleground of rock-throwing. Gunfire erupted from the Hun
Sen crowd.
	   Human-rights workers confirmed that one protester trying to flee
was chased down, beaten, shot in the back and killed by Hun Sen's
crowd. The victim was pronounced dead at a hospital. A pool of
blood and his hat remained at the site.
	   A young boy shot in the leg refused to get into an ambulance to
take him to the capital's main Calmette hospital, seen as a bastion
of Hun Sen support. None of the other wounded were taken to
Calmette, either.
	   It is widely believed that the body of a Buddhist monk reported
to have been slain in a brutal police charge Wednesday and taken by
the ambulance never arrived at the hospital. Rumors that many monks
have been killed have intensified anger at Hun Sen.
	   The vastly outnumbered opposition group _ whose leaders had
taken away a club from one member earlier to keep a planned march
to the U.N. Center for Human Rights non-violent _ tried to flee on
motorbikes and on foot down the narrow, pot-holed streets.
	   Riot police who have acted as Hun Sen's shock troops since he
launched a crackdown against weeks of peaceful protest against his
rule Monday deployed only after the blood-letting and made no move
to keep the two sides apart.
	   The members of Hun Sen's formerly communist CPP were highly
organized. Members wore rubber bands on their wrists to distinguish
themselves from the oppostion in a melee. They carried printed
signs on bamboo staves _ which were quickly turned into clubs.
	   They hunted down opposition supporters up through the city's
central market, where shops were closed. Sullen onlookers made no
move to join the pro-Hun Sen crowd, a marked contrast to thousands
who spontaneously joined a peaceful opposition march Thursday.
	   CPP organizers directed their men with walkie-talkes and mobile
phones. Bullhorns blared slogans: ``Long live Hun Sen! Down with
the losers of the July 26 elections!''

Police break up protest by New Guinea demonstrators; troops on
</HEADLINE>
standby

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Police on Friday broke up a peaceful
demonstration outside the United States embassy by about 70
protesters demanding independence for the Indonesian-controlled
western half of New Guinea.
	   Officers were armed with sticks, but there was no violence.
	   Earlier, the group staged a protest outside of the office of
armed forces commander Gen. Wiranto where they complained about
human rights abuses in Irian Jaya by Indonesian troops.
	   They said they intended to march to the Jakarta office of the
United Nations.
	   Nearby, squads of soldiers were on standby inside the grounds of
the state palace Friday following days of student protests against
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie and his failure to control
soaring food prices.
	   There were no signs of trouble but dozens of troops were also
stationed in a park adjacent to the palace where a noisy
demonstration took place Thursday.
	   Discontent with Habibie's crisis-bound presidency has been
mounting. Looting and riots fueled by climbing food prices have hit
several areas in recent weeks.
	   On Monday, students marched on Parliament and tore down the
gates of the Parliament after they demanded that Habibie lower
prices or quit.
	   Troops and police used sticks, shields and tear gas to evict
them from its grounds on Tuesday.
	   On Wednesday a visit by Habibie to Indonesia's second-largest
city, Surabaya, was marred when 4,000 students and opposition
supporters protested.
	   Friday's protest was the latest in a series by people from the
province of Irian Jaya, formerly Dutch New Guinea, which was
annexed by Indonesia in 1963.
	   Calls for self-determination for the province and other troubled
parts of Indonesia, including the former Portuguese colony of East
Timor, have mounted since the resignation in May of former
autocratic President Suharto.
	   Meanwhile, legislators say they might order Suharto to explain
why economic and social order all but collapsed in the weeks
leading to his resignation.
	   Suharto quit after 32 years in power following a wave of student
protests and riots. About 1,200 people were killed and thousands of
stores and homes burned and ransacked _ many of them belonging to
the ethnic Chinese minority, blamed as scapegoats for the worst
economic crisis in 30 years.
	   A senior legislator Poedjono Pranyoto said there were growing
calls for Suharto to make an accountability speech to a special
session of the People's Consultative Assembly, which is to convene
in November to debate sweeping democratic reforms proposed by
Habibie.
	   The reforms are to open the way for elections next year.
	   Since leaving office Suharto has remained at his home in
Jakarta. He has denied accusations that he corruptly amassed a
fortune overseas for himself and his family during his presidency.

Most Japanese will stay in Singapore, ambassador says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Despite dwindling business opportunities, most
of the 30,000 Japanese in Singapore will not leave this year,
Ambassador Hiroshi Hashimoto was quoted Friday as saying.
	   ``Japan does not react like Western companies, which will more
readily withdraw their capital when they detect potential losses,
without consideration for the fate of their local employees,'' The
Straits Times quoted Hashimoto as saying in a speech to 40
businessmen, college students and members of the Fort Canning
Country Club.
	   He said 3 to 5 percent of the Japanese in Singapore were likely
to leave this year, the paper said.
	   Takashi Imai, chairman of the Keidanren, an influential Japanese
business organization, will stop in Singapore during a Nov. 22-28
tour that will also include Hong Kong, Indonesia and Malaysia, the
paper quoted Hashimoto as saying. The visit was a result of a
request Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong made to then-foreign
minister Keizo Obuchi last May, for more Japanese economic
delegations to visit Singapore.
	   Japan invested 2 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 1.15 billion)
in Singapore manufacturing last year and another 496 million
Singapore dollars (dlrs 286 million) in the first quarter of this
year, Hashimoto was quoted as saying in the Wednesday speech.
	   The paper did not say why the report was delayed.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Lying in a hospital with an
intravenous drip in his arm, Buddhist monk Seng Bun Chhoeun figures
he will recover from the beating he received from riot police. It's
the mental scars that may not heal.
	   ``I'm not so physically hurt,'' said Seng Bun Chhoeun, 23. ``But
it hurts so much in my heart.''
	   Scores of Buddhist monks, most of them young men like the
motorcycle drivers and students who have led protests against
authoritarian leader Hun Sen, have not been spared attacks by riot
police. Hun Sen unleashed the troops to crush weeks of
demonstrations calling for an end to his 13-year rule.
	   The attacks on the monks, who have been kicked, clubbed and shot
at, have intensified opposition to Hun Sen.
	   But attacking monks _ held in untouchable reverence by
Cambodians a couple of generations ago before the genocidal Khmer
Rouge exterminated the clergy _ reflects changes in Cambodian
society as much as Hun Sen's determination to hold power.
	   Critics have accused the younger generation of monks of becoming
too involved with politics _ and less concerned about the Buddha's
teachings _ since the 1993 U.N.-sponsored elections attempted to
bring democracy to the country.
	   In addition, monks have been involved in violent assaults and
sex scandals in recent months, further diminishing respect for
their robes. Budhhist monks are barred from staring at or talking
long to women. Music and amassing personal wealth are also off
limits.
	   In one high-profile case, a monk stabbed a student who had asked
him to stop singing at the pagoda where both men lived. A pagoda is
a type of religious sanctuary.
	   ``I'm used to hearing that a knife or stick is used in a fight
between people outside a pagoda,'' said the student, 30-year-old
Chhum Ratana. ``But this was inside the pagoda and the monk had a
knife. It's strange.''
	   The monk has disappeared, and Chhum Ratana never received the
100,000 riels (dlrs 26) compensation he demanded for the wound on
his arm. But the case attracted wide attention in the country.
	   ``It was disgraceful for Buddhism in Cambodia,'' said Sok Pin,
deputy director of religious affairs at the Ministry of Cults and
Religions, whose office is receiving more than 10 complaints a
month about monk misbehavior.
	   In recent months, a monk was arrested at a temple in Phnom Penh
and jailed for drug-trafficking. Two monks at another temple were
beaten up by local residents for allegedly embezzling donations.
They were subsequently defrocked.
	   Cambodia's most widely read magazine, Popular, featured a story
in August on a marriage that broke up when a husband caught a monk
propositioning his wife. The husband beat up the monk, divorced his
wife and took the two children with him.
	   Cambodia had more than 70,000 monks before 1975. But after they
came to power, the Khmer Rouge abolished religion, forcing monks to
abandon their robes and perform hard labor.
	   Most of the 3,290 temples were destroyed or turned into prisons
or cages for raising pigs. There is no record of how many monks
were executed or died.
	   Religious practices were revived after the Khmer Rouge were
driven from power by a Vietnamese invasion in 1979. Now, nearly
47,000 monks reside in 3,612 temples across the country. But most
are relatively young and have few real buddhist leaders to look to
for guidance.
	   Still, Sok Pin said 95 percent of Cambodians follow Buddhism.
And the religion is often regarded as the pillar of the country's
recovery.
	   Monks have taken part in peace walks through heavily mined areas
to protest violence and civil war. The core message is
non-violence.
	   But Cambodia is a country of few rules, where the elite live by
corruption and Khmer Rouge killers join the government. In such an
environment, many monks break the rules and lose the sheen of
symbolizing good moral conduct.
	   Lao Mong Hay, director of the Khmer Institute for Democracy,
said recent incidents involving monks are ``just a reflection of
the society.''
	   ``Who are those monks? Where are they from?'' Lao Mong Hay
asked. ``They are from society, they are just lay people going to
monkhood, and when they don't abide by Buddhist teaching and
disciplines, then it is just lay people in yellow robes. No more,
no less.''

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines' inability to
repay dlrs 25 million owed to other carriers has resulted in their
refusing to recognize its ticket holders, a senior airline official
said Friday.
	   That could mean trouble for PAL ticket holders who want to
switch to other airlines if their travel plans change.
	   The decision by all but one of the 231 airlines in the
International Air Transport Association, which took effect Sept. 4,
stems from PAL's failure to pay obligations incurred in June, the
official said.
	   PAL's monthly billing with IATA members normally averages dlrs 5
million, but a pilots' strike in June caused it to book thousands
of passengers onto other airlines, which caused its obligations to
soar to record levels.
	   The official said the airline is currently in talks with IATA
members to address the problem and hopes to resolve it before next
month.
	   The dispute with the IATA is an additional financial worry for
the cash-strapped airline, which has had to suspend debt payments
of dlrs 2.1 billion and seek a rehabilitation plan following the
costly labor dispute.
	   PAL is asking IATA members to reschedule its June billing
arrears. So far, only Germany's Deutsche Lufthansa AG has agreed to
the request and is recognizing PAL ticket holders transferring to
Lufthansa.
	   The PAL official, who spoke on the condition he not be named,
said negotiations are under way with regional airlines Cathay
Pacific Airways Ltd. and Singapore Airlines Ltd. to defer the
payment of billing arrears.
	   ``This strike is still haunting us. Definitely, it pushes
Philippine Airlines into difficulties,'' he said.
	   In the financial year that ended March 31, PAL lost 8.08 billion
pesos (dlrs 185 million) following a loss of 2.50 billion pesos
(dlrs 57 million) the year before.

Colorado beats Florida 3-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Darryl Kile pitched a two-hitter and Dante
Bichette homered as Colorado completed a four-game sweep of Florida
with a 3-1 victory on Thursday.
	   Kile, 0-2 in his last three starts at Coors Field, allowed only
a bunt single by Luis Castillo in the third inning and a triple by
Todd Dunwoody leading off the ninth. Dunwoody scored on a groundout
by Edgar Renteria.
	   Kile (11-16) struck out four and walked two.
	   Bichette, who had a pair of hits and extended his hitting streak
to 12 games, began Colorado's sixth with his 21st homer of the
season, a line drive over the left-field fence off Florida starter
Rafael Medina.
	   Medina (1-3), in his fifth start since being recalled from
Triple-A on Aug. 19, worked seven innings, allowing three runs on
nine hits.
 &UR; Dodgers 4, Padres 3 &QC; 
	   In San Diego, Kevin Brown pitched six perfect innings before
allowing four runs in the seventh as the Los Angeles Dodgers
rallied to ruin yet another San Diego no-hit bid.
	   Brown (18-6) failed to become the NL's first 19-game winner, but
did set San Diego's single-season strikeout record with 238 by
fanning 11.
	   San Diego has never pitched a no-hitter in its 30-year history.
Brown pitched a no-hitter last season while with Florida.
	   Chan Ho Park (13-8) won for the eighth time in nine decisions.
He struck out 10 and walked a career-high seven, allowed five hits
and three runs in seven innings. Jeff Shaw earned his 42nd save.
 &UR; Cardinals 8, Reds 7 &QC; 
	   In Cincinnati, Mark McGwire tied Barry Bonds' NL record of 151
walks by drawing two more, though his record home run total
remained at 62 as the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Cincinnati Reds.
	   McGwire also struck out twice and popped out, leaving him
without a homer in two games since breaking Roger Maris' record.
It's the first time he's gone consecutive games without hitting one
since Aug. 28-29.
	   Cinergy Field, known as Riverfront Stadium when it opened 28
years ago, remains one of only two major league parks where McGwire
has failed to hit a homer in his career. Turner Field, the other
one he has yet to conquer, opened last year.
 &UR; Braves 7, Expos 4 &QC; 
	   In Montreal, Javy Lopez hit a three-run homer and Kevin Millwood
became the third Atlanta pitcher to win 15 games as the Braves
ended a three-game losing streak.
	   Lopez hit his 33rd home run, a shot off Mike Thurman (3-4) in
the third inning that gave the Braves a 5-1 lead. Atlanta went on
to win for only the second time in its last seven games.
	   Millwood (15-8) allowed four runs _ two earned _ and nine hits
in 6 2-3 innings. Tom Glavine has won 18 games for the Braves and
Greg Maddux has won 17.
 &UR; Cubs 5, Pirates 2 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Sammy Sosa's home run drought reached five games,
but it didn't keep the Chicago Cubs from beating the Pittsburgh
Pirates to stay tied with the New York Mets in the NL wild-card
chase.
	   Sosa, stuck on 58 homers and trailing Mark McGwire by four
entering the day, went 0-for-2 with a pair of walks.
	   Chicago got strong pitching from Kevin Tapani and key hits from
Mark Grace and Brant Brown in a five-run third inning.
	   Tapani (18-7) raised his career record against the Pirates to
5-0, including four wins this year. He allowed eight hits in eight
innings and won his sixth straight decision. Rod Beck pitched the
ninth for his 46th save.
 &UR; Mets 7, Phillies 5 &QC; 
	   In Philadelphia, Mike Piazza continued his torrid hitting with a
three-run homer and a double, and Al Leiter pitched seven strong
innings as the New York Mets defeated the Philadelphia Phillies.
	   The Mets took a 5-0 lead in the first inning on Piazza's 30th
homer and Rey Ordonez' two-run double. In his last 15 games, Piazza
is 27-for-50 (.540) with seven home runs and 19 RBIs.
	   The Phillies closed to 7-5 in the ninth on an error by second
baseman Carlos Baerga and Doug Glanville's one-out RBI single off
closer John Franco. But Franco struck out Kevin Sefcik and retired
Scott Rolen on a forceout for his 35th save.
	   Leiter (15-5) gave up two runs and two hits, struck out eight
and walked two.
 &UR; Astros 7, Brewers 1 &QC; 
	   In Houston, Shane Reynolds tied a career high with 12 strikeouts
and hit a two-run single as the Houston Astros won their sixth
straight.
	   The Astros lowered the magic number for clinching their second
straight NL Central title to four. Houston also stayed in front in
the race for the best record in the league, one win ahead of
Atlanta and two ahead of San Diego.
	   Tony Eusebio drove in three runs and Derek Bell drove in two.
Bell later made a mental mistake in right field, tossing a live
ball into the stands, but Houston went on to its 94th victory _ two
behind the team record set by the 1986 club.
	   Reynolds (18-8) gave up seven hits in 8 1-3 innings. He took a
shutout into the ninth inning, but walked Geoff Jenkins with one
out and the bases loaded.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Paul O'Neill hit two home runs for the second
straight game and the New York Yankees overcame another shaky
outing by Andy Pettitte for an 8-5 win over the Toronto Blue Jays
on Thursday night.
	   With their 103rd victory, the Yankees, who clinched the AL East
on Wednesday in Boston, opened a 21-game advantage over the
second-place Red Sox. It's the largest lead a Yankee team has ever
enjoyed at any time in a season.
	   Jose Canseco hit a three-run homer for Toronto, which lost for
just the second time in 13 games and fell five games behind idle
Boston in the AL wild-card race.
	   O'Neill, who hit two homers on Wednesday, connected for a
two-run homer in the first and a solo shot in the fourth for the
Yankees, now eight wins shy of matching the AL record of 111 wins
in a season.
	   Pettitte (16-9) allowed five runs and seven hits with five walks
in six innings.
