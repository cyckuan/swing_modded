JUSTICE DEPT. DETAILS ITS CASE AGAINST FORMER STARR SPOKESMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Subs response from The Times in 21st graf) By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department detailed its case Monday
against Charles Bakaly, the former spokesman for Independent
Counsel Ken Starr, accusing Bakaly of lying when he denied leaking
information last year to The New York Times about a possible
indictment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly will go on trial here on Thursday on charges of criminal
contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's brief said Bakaly's false answers to
government lawyers obstructed justice by delaying a federal judge's
investigation into the news leaks and causing ``unnecessary work
and costs'' for the court and others.
</P>
<P>
   In the investigation, Judge Norma Holloway Johnson of federal
District Court had been trying to determine the source of reports
by the Times and other news organizations, specifically a January
1999 article in the Times, that said Starr had concluded that a
sitting president could be indicted.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief filed in response to the charges, Bakaly's lawyers
insisted that his statements were not false and that in any case,
they were not relevant to an investigation of possible leaks of
grand jury evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In their brief, defense lawyers conceded that Bakaly had
discussed the subject with a reporter for the Times, but had not
discussed anything that was not already public knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the lawyers argued, guilt can only be established in a
criminal contempt case by actions that amounted to ``a public wrong
against the court,'' not against others.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly's lawyers said in the brief that Congress wrote the
contempt law ``specifically to preclude a judicial power to hold a
witness in criminal contempt any time the court believes that the
witness has testified falsely and thereby prolonged or complicated
proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   While accusations of improper leaks had plagued Starr's
investigation of President Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky from its start in early 1998, the Jan. 31, 1999, article
in The Times caused a particularly intense response.
</P>
<P>
   The article by Don Van Natta Jr. was published during the
president's impeachment trial by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   It said Starr had decided that he had the authority to seek an
indictment of Clinton before he left office. It said he had not
decided whether to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The article also said: ``Inside the independent counsel's
office, a group of prosecutors believes that not long after the
Senate trial concludes, Mr. Starr should ask the grand jury of 23
men and women hearing the case against Mr. Clinton to indict him on
charges of perjury and obstruction of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The report was attributed to ``several associates of Mr.
Starr.'' It said Bakaly had ``declined to discuss the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson sought to prosecute Bakaly for leaking grand jury
material in violation of federal rules. But last September, a
federal appeals court here said that the rule barred prosecutors
from publicly discussing ``matters occurring before the grand
jury,'' and that the views of Starr and his associates about a
possible indictment of a president did not fit that definition.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly was accused of lying three times in a sworn statement to
Johnson, specifically when he said that he had refused ``to discuss
nonpublic matters'' with both Van Natta and Jill Abramson, a
reporter who is now the Washington editor of the Times; that he had
``refused to confirm or comment'' on what Starr ``was thinking of
doing''; and that Van Natta had ``assured me that his sources were
outside'' the independent counsel's office and that the reporter
``intended to make it clear'' in his article.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly was also accused of withholding information from outside
lawyers hired by Starr's office to investigate the leak to the
Times.
</P>
<P>
   Because he withheld the information, the Justice Department
brief said, ``Mr. Bakaly knowingly caused a materially false and
misleading statement to be made in a brief filed by the OIC with
this court, as follows: `Mr. Van Natta further told Mr. Bakaly that
all his information came from sources `outside' the OIC.''' OIC is
the Office of Independent Counsel.
</P>
<P>
   In their defense, Bakaly's lawyers accused the lawyers who
prepared the statement of ignoring much of what Bakaly told them
about his dealings with Van Natta.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly acknowledged, they said, that he had dealt with Van Natta
on the story and had even sent him portions of an internal
memorandum on the constitutional issues.
</P>
<P>
   They insisted that when Bakaly confirmed to Van Natta that Starr
had the four options _ indicting the president, not indicting him,
indicting him under seal or indicting him after he left office _
the spokesman was in fact revealing nothing but merely acting to
``confirm a truism.''
</P>
<P>
   Editors at The Times have said they do not and will not discuss
the sources for the article.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly won some public support from a consistent, intense critic
of Starr and his investigations, Julian Epstein, the chief
Democratic lawyer on the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Epstein called the case ``a terrible prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the appeals court had found that no offense against grand
jury secrecy had been committed, making this case against Bakaly
amounted to no more than ``a semantical game of gotcha,'' Epstein
said Monday.

 HEADWATERS LOGGING PLAN HALTED  &HT;     By HARRIET CHIANG 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A judge blocked a plan Monday by Pacific Lumber
Co. to log a section of unprotected land within California's
Headwaters Forest Reserve. Environmentalists had opposed the
logging, saying it would cause irreparable harm to wildlife and
would disrupt visitors to the wilderness area.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club and Environmental Protection Information Center
in Garberville sued in March to stop the lumber company from using
helicopters to lift fallen timber from the ``Hole in the
Headwaters,'' a 705-acre patch of land owned by the company and
surrounded by public land.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Lumber acquired the patch of land as part of the $480
million deal last year with state and federal agencies to create a
7,500-acre wildlife preserve.
</P>
<P>
   In ruling in favor of the environmentalists, San Mateo Superior
Court Judge Quentin Kopp said the lumber company's harvesting plan
to bring in Chinook helicopters marks a significant change from the
original proposal and requires public review.
</P>
<P>
   While Kopp granted the environmentalists' request for a
preliminary injunction, the judge also required the Sierra Club to
post a $250,000 bond to cover the profits the lumber company says
it will lose from the delay.
</P>
<P>
   Kopp, who went to Eureka in June to hear a day of arguments, was
called into the case after Humboldt County judges either recused
themselves or were challenged by lawyers involved in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Bailey, forest conservation chairwoman for the Sierra Club
of California, called the bond requirement ``troubling,'' saying it
could have a potentially chilling effect on future lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   However, she said, ``at this point the main thing for us is that
he has issued a temporary injunction.''
</P>
<P>
   John Campbell, president and CEO of Pacific Lumber, said the
company was disappointed with the ruling but confident it would
ultimately prevail in a trial. ``Our inability to operate this plan
will result in hardship for the company and our employees,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell stressed that the property does not include old-growth
trees. ``We have made improvements to the harvest plan to increase
protection for fish, wildlife and water quality,'' he said, adding
that the changes provide the ``proper balance between sustainable
timber harvesting, job preservations and environmental
protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Bacik, the lawyer for Pacific Lumber, said the 705 acres
are third-growth _ or previously harvested _ forest. ``It's not a
pristine wilderness,'' he said. ``It's all commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   After the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection
approved the company's logging plan in February, environmentalists
filed suit, contending that noise from the helicopters would harm
the area's wildlife and disturb visitors to the reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs also charged that Pacific Lumber's use of an
access road would further destabilize a landslide area that
provides habitat for salmon in the Elk River.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Bailey said, environmentalists hope to purchase the
area, which she called ``a very important part of the reserve.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to make sure that the Elk River remains protected
so that the salmon do not become extinct,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In his 19-page opinion, Kopp agreed that the company's plan to
use the road required further public review because it differed
significantly from the original proposal.
</P>
<P>
   He lashed out at the California Department of Forestry for ``its
silence'' over potential adverse effects from use the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``CDF did not notify the public of an opportunity for review,''
Kopp wrote. ``It did not solicit public comment. Instead, it
ignored the request of petitioner Sierra Club for simple
notification of receipt of a proposed amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A believer in orchestration might reasonably conclude CDF's
actions were intentionally executed to prevent public exposure or
comment,'' Kopp wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kopp wasn't drawing any conclusions, he said he wanted
to explore further how CDF handled the issue.

PRISONERS' GROUP CALLS FOR LOCATING, RE-TESTING INMATES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By JANET WELLS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A California prisoner's advocacy group demanded Monday that the
state Department of Corrections locate and offer free re-testing to
thousands of inmates whose medical tests were faked by a fraudulent
lab.
</P>
<P>
   California Prison Focus addressed its demands in a letter to
C.A. Terhune, head of the Department of Corrections, which
maintains 160,000 inmates in the state's 33 prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prisoners have lived for years not knowing their medical
condition and therefore not accessing treatment. It is your
responsibility to immediately remedy this situation,'' the letter
chided the corrections department.
</P>
<P>
   ``It spells serious human rights violations,'' said Judy
Greenspan, chair of the advocacy's group's HIV in Prison committee,
which drafted the letter.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, federal health officials warned seven state prisons
that lab tests done by B.C.L. Clinical Labs in the early and
mid-1990s to screen for AIDS, hepatitis and other serious diseases
were inaccurate. A Chronicle investigation revealed the Department
of Corrections made little attempt to re-test the inmates or notify
them that their test results were in question.
</P>
<P>
   The lab, located in Southern California, was shut down in 1997.
But three years later, the Department of Corrections still does not
know how many prisoners might have been affected by the lab's
fraudulent practices.
</P>
<P>
   The wife of an inmate at Deuel Vocational Institute _ one of 11
state prisons that contracted with B.C.L. _ said she is ``terribly
concerned'' about her health and that of her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``He received full lab testing prior to our marriage in 1994,
for AIDS, Hepatitis C, and looked absolutely clear,'' said the
woman, a Bay Area health care professional who asked for anonymity.
``My decision to marry was based on that set of tests that came
back from the labs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I feel that I was placed at highest risk? Absolutely.
Wantonly and negatively. This is insane. The health department has
a responsibility to contact people,'' said the woman. ``This is a
public health catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   A state Department of Health Services spokeswoman _ who
acknowledged Monday that its file on B.C.L. is ``missing'' _ said
the department fulfilled its legal responsibility by providing
information to the Department of Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would never directly contact patients because of
patient-physician confidentiality,'' said health department
spokeswoman Lea Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   According to spokeswoman Terry Thornton, the Corrections
Department had not received the letter from the advocacy group.
Thornton reiterated the department's position Monday that many of
the prisoners probably have already been retested.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence of any formalized program of retesting
... (but) just because we don't have evidence doesn't mean that
inmates were not retested,'' she said. ``These doctors were very
much aware of problems of this lab, and they were responding
appropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical staff at several prisons that contracted with B.C.L. had
expressed concerns about the lab since 1995, and Dr. John Culton,
Chuckawala Valley State Prison's chief medical officer, tipped
state investigators to the lab's shoddy work.
</P>
<P>
   While the state has not tracked the thousands of inmates who
received lab tests from B.C.L., Thornton said the impact is ``blown
out of proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to jump the gun and say everybody's running
around with these diseases,'' she said. ``But we don't want to be
at the other end of the extreme and say there's nothing to worry
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, of California Prison Focus, is concerned that the
B.C.L. fraud could exacerbate an already hefty rate of Hepatitis C
infection in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a study of 5,000 inmates, nearly 35 percent of incoming
prisoners test positive for Hepatitis C, a hardy, incurable virus
that is easily transmitted via shared needles, even through shared
razors or eating utensils if a carrier has open cuts. Hepatitis C,
which can remain virtually undetected for decades, attacks the
liver.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators continued this week to hammer the Department of
Corrections for information on the status of prisoners tested by
B.C.L., said Rand Martin, chief of staff for Sen. John
Vasconcellos, D-Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get a sense of what the department can and
will do. As far as Prison Focus' call for free retesting, that goes
without saying. We would expect that of the department.''
</P>
<P>
   But the department indicated last week that finding and testing
all the prisoners affected may not be possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't something you can figure out overnight,'' Thornton
said.

2001 ALL-STAR GAME IN SEATTLE: A TRAFFIC JAM OF JOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A year from Tuesday Seattle will be enveloped in
baseball's All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   The early line: Fewer rubber bullets than WTO, but less
dope-smoking than EMP.
</P>
<P>
   (Alert to Eugene anarchists: Mayor Paul Schell is happy to
concede downtown again, but don't even think about messing with the
new ballpark.)
</P>
<P>
   All three events are brought to you by Microsoft money (don't
forget, the techies own a big chunk of the Mariners, too), so it's
all one big link to the same CPU.
</P>
<P>
   Since forward thinking created all the wealth that brought these
wonderful events, it continues to be smart to look ahead and plan
for the 2001 game. Actually, I might be a little late already,
since SoDo traffic already has had to begin queuing for the
contest.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, the Mariners sent to Atlanta a huge delegation
of owners, executives and staffers to observe the game's
operations. Which should guarantee one thing: massive cost
overruns.
</P>
<P>
   But regardless of cost (that's the civic motto now, isn't it?),
the good times for Puget Sound-area baseball fans at this
celebration are broader and more diverse than what can be observed
via the TV coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle hasn't hosted an All-Star Game since the dark ages of
1979. Much has changed. Here is what's in store (and if it isn't,
shame on the Mariners and the host committee):
</P>
<P>
   Balloting: As the center of the Internet universe, Seattle will
be the first city to host the game in which players were voted upon
entirely by e-mail. Starting at catcher for the American League:
Joe Oliver (JavaScript error message 27).
</P>
<P>
   Rosters: Also for the first time, players must bring a note from
a medical doctor before being excused from play. Or in cases
involving a certain center fielder, a note from a psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   Highlight videos: At the request of a certain player (and his
psychologist), stadium video highlights of rival outfielders will
not be shown.
</P>
<P>
   Media coverage: The Seattle dailies will produce gargantuan
special sections about the All-Star Game, the immortality of
baseball and its vivid place in the cosmos. Each paper will stage a
contest to find a person who will read every word, the winner
earning the right to be named Publisher for Life.
</P>
<P>
   No one will win.
</P>
<P>
   Home run contest: Lately this event has come close to upstaging
the game. But Seattle's pitcher-friendly ballpark is a threat to
its success. So the fences will be moved in to just beyond the
infield. Hundreds of homers will be hit, the crowd will go crazy.
By the following season, Commissioner Bud Selig will have made the
dimensions mandatory for every park.
</P>
<P>
   Run around the bases: A popular event for kids won't be allowed
because the field conditions are so delicate that groundskeepers
tend to lose their jobs over it. So the event will be moved to the
parking garage and expanded to something called Run Around David
Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Game-day special promotion: After winter rains rusted in place
the roof that was almost never used during the baseball season,
Mariners owners will issue wire brushes and safety harnesses to the
first 20,000 fans. Once they get the roof mechanism unstuck, fans
will be allowed to keep the equipment as All-Star souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-game ceremony: Chicago White Sox shortstop Alex Rodriguez
will receive his World Series ring from the Mariners, whom he left
in free agency after the championship. Rodriguez will thank the
fans and say it was truly a team effort, a point contradicted by
the 15 games the team is behind Oakland in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   Concessions conflagration: After fans from around the country,
many visiting the ballpark for the first time, sample the first
$10, six-ounce cups of beer in Major League Baseball history, they
will protest by setting the stadium on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Post-game fireworks: Traffic will be so constipated that fire
trucks cannot reach the stadium until the fire's temperatures melt
steel. Fire officials will later say it wouldn't have made a
difference; the department budget could not have afforded the
parking.
</P>
<P>
   Economic impact: Estimates, done by the same people who insist
50,000 fans at Seafair are actually 500,000, will range to $10
billion for the local economy. But there is no private money
available to build the replacement stadium. So the Mariners will
agree to play two years at Husky Stadium until the state finances a
stadium built with a fireproof, fixed concrete roof.

A WAY TO BRING FLEEING MURDER SUSPECTS BACK FROM MEXICO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &HT;    By LISA VAN PROYEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It took 19 months to convince a Mexican judge that
Jose Luis Del Toro Jr. is an American and should stand trial in the
United States for the brutal death of a Florida woman.
</P>
<P>
   But thousands of other fugitives have fled south of the border
from Los Angeles and elsewhere with little fear of extradition
because Mexico will not return its own citizens who face the death
penalty to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A Florida congressman has proposed a law that would have
tremendous implications in Los Angeles by sanctioning Mexico and
other countries for failing to cooperate in extraditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main objective is to close the loophole. We want the
criminals to be held accountable for their heinous acts,'' said
Martin Baker, a spokesman for Rep. Dan Miller, R-Bradenton, who
sponsored the bill, HR 3212.
</P>
<P>
   The bill comes as Mexico's new reform-minded president, Vicente
Fox, has pledged to crack down on crime and corruption in his
country.
</P>
<P>
   Some police officers and officials in Los Angeles support
Miller's bill, although others say it could backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people get pushy with Mexico, the emotions of the nation
surface because we've always been looked at as the Big Brother,''
said Detective Art Zorrilla, who heads the Los Angeles Police
Department's Foreign Prosecution Unit. ``Sometimes, pushing our
weight around really works against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Each year, about 50 people accused of violent crimes in Los
Angeles flee to Mexico, Zorrilla said. Mexico has refused to send
back any of its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead, they tell us, `Bring us your evidence, and we will
try him here,' '' Zorrilla said. ``It's a sovereignty thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Zorrilla believes Mexico might change its policy if the high
number of crimes committed by Mexican nationals here against other
Mexican nationals is clearly demonstrated to officials across the
border.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's bill seeks to build a case against Mexico by requiring
the State Department to submit an annual report to Congress about
delays for extraditions and actions taken. If five or more
grievances are filed against a country for not extraditing a
criminal, that nation could be deemed uncooperative. Sanctions,
including the denial of visas to high-ranking officials, could also
be imposed.
</P>
<P>
   That would've been the case with Sheila Bellush, whom Del Toro
is accused of shooting to death in 1997 before slitting her throat
in front of her 2-year-old quadruplets.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of appeals that Baker refers to as ``stall
tactics,'' a judge in Mexico agreed to allow the extradition. Del
Toro pleaded guilty last week in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Miller wants to make sure families don't have to battle
Mexico over extradition and cooperation on criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to make sure that cases like this don't happen
again and make it easier to return them. No victim's family should
be forced to wait 19 months or longer to face justice,'' Baker
said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is awaiting hearings by the Judiciary and International
Relations committees before being reported to the House.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles congressional representatives said they have not
decided how to vote on the bill, but they agree with its intent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murderers, rapists and other criminals must never be allowed
to evade the American justice system by crossing international
borders,'' said Rep. Howard Berman, D-Mission Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Woodland Hills, agreed that reforms are
needed, but not necessarily by denying visas to high-ranking
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to make sure they are adequately tried and
punished if they are guilty is to have them extradited to the
U.S.,'' Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Los Angeles police look for justice in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Since his unit was formed in 1985, detectives have filed more
than 300 cases in Mexico, with a 40 percent to 50 percent
conviction or clearance rate, Zorrilla said. A case can be cleared
if the criminal has died.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing a case for filing in Mexico can take anywhere from two
months to a year, with detectives working six weeks alone on
translating the murder scene, witness statements and evidence
reports into Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all kinds of problems,'' said homicide Detective Bob
Vanina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, I can make a phone call and somebody can computer-access
a name for us. Down there, that's not the case. They all seem to be
hand-written records,'' Vanina said. ``It's frustrating here
because you do all this work and you never get to place the
handcuffs on the suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the fugitives Los Angeles police have asked Mexican
authorities to look for is Jose Rodriguez, who detectives say was
recently spotted in a Mexican town.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year-old is accused of fatally stabbing his 36-year-old
uncle with a kitchen knife in Van Nuys on June 4 after they clashed
over the teen-ager's drinking, said Detective Al Aldaz.
</P>
<P>
   The uncle, Alvaro Montenegro, simply wanted to give his nephew a
better life in the United States, providing him a job and shelter
at his home after the youngster arrived illegally two months
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Police suspect someone drove Rodriguez to the border after
Montenegro's slaying.
</P>
<P>
   On June 14, detectives traveled to Mexico City to file the case,
said Van Nuys homicide Detective Jim Rahm.
</P>
<P>
   Zorrilla said the advantage with this case is that the suspect
was immediately identified by family members who witnessed the
killing.

EVIDENCE MOUNTS THAT CIRCUMCISION MAY REDUCE AIDS
TRANSMISSION  RATES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SABIN RUSSELL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ Male circumcision, a surgery so ancient
it was first written onto the stone tomb walls of Egyptian
pharaohs, is gaining urgent new attention here among doctors
battling a modern-day African plague.
</P>
<P>
   A growing body of evidence suggests that surgical removal of the
foreskin, a common rite of passage in western Africa but rarer in
the AIDS-stricken southern and eastern African nations, could
significantly reduce the odds that a boy will one day pick up HIV,
the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   At the 13th International AIDS Conference Monday, researchers
compared notes and, for the first time at the highly influential
meeting, debated the merits of adding male circumcision to the list
of HIV prevention measures.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists presented conflicting but intriguing data. Several
studies suggest that male circumcision might cut the risk of HIV
infection in half _ an extraordinary result that is comparable to
the benefits expected from some future vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists who are more skeptical believe the benefits
attributed to circumcision, which is a ritual of the Muslim and
Jewish faiths, actually may be the result of other cultural and
behavioral factors, such as Muslim traditions of abstinence from
alcohol and genital washing before regular prayers.
</P>
<P>
   But many top scientists are becoming convinced that the evidence
of a protective effect is compelling. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director
of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases,
said in an interview that he believes the link between male
circumcision and lower HIV infection rates is now ``an absolute
fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The link might never have come up but for the work of a
determined band of specialists who call themselves medical
anthropologists. Unlike laboratory bench scientists, they study
human behavior and cultural practices in the field.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, anthropologist Priscilla Reining drew up a map of
African cities, marking those where the male population is
circumcised and those where it is not. She placed atop it another
map of HIV infection rates. The results were startling: Almost
everywhere that AIDS rates were spiraling out of control, the men
were uncircumcised.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foreskin itself provides a route for transmission of the
virus,'' said Reining, 77, of Washington, D.C., now retired from
the American Association for the Advancement of Science. ``If it's
gone, the route is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Other studies seem to support that conclusion. In November,
University of California at San Francisco anthropologist Daniel
Halperin and Robert Bailey of the University of Illinois published
an article in the influential British journal The Lancet demanding
that scientists pay attention to 10 years of data that had been
quietly accumulating on circumcision and HIV. Twenty-seven of 38
studies had found ``significant associations'' between the lack of
male circumcision and HIV infection. Only one study found the
reverse effect.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey calculated that in cultures where circumcision rates are
low, up to 55 percent of HIV infections could be attributed to lack
of circumcision. ``If you can have a public health measure that
reduces infection or illness by 25 percent to 30 percent, that is
considered to be a very successful intervention,'' Bailey said.
``We're talking about a 50 percent reduction. That is huge by
public health standards.''
</P>
<P>
   The renewed interest in circumcision for AIDS prevention,
however, comes at a time when American baby boomers are abandoning
the procedure for their own children. Support for the medical
benefits has been eroding for decades. In 1971, the American
Academy of Pediatrics declared there were ``no valid medical
indications'' for infant circumcision.
</P>
<P>
   The push to promote circumcision as an AIDS prevention measure
in developing countries has outraged anti-circumcision advocates,
including San Anselmo-based NOCIRC, a group that maintains that
circumcision is a brutal procedure justified in America by sloppy
science.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scare tactics are always consistent with the dreaded
disease of the times,'' said Marilyn Milos, founder of NOCIRC.
``There was a penile cancer scare in the '30s; a cervical cancer
scare in the '50s; and the sexually transmitted disease scare of
the '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   Author David Gollaher, who dubbed circumcision ``the world's
most controversial surgery'' in his medical history of the
procedure, said the case for an HIV link is simply not strong
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole argument has surfaced in America, a nation with one
of the highest circumcision rates, and also the highest HIV rate in
the industrialized world,'' he said. Gollaher noted that
circumcision rates are low in Europe, and so are HIV infection
rates.
</P>
<P>
   But Halperin notes there are also biological reasons that
suggest the foreskin is particularly vulnerable to HIV. The thin,
fragile tissue of the foreskin can tear and bleed during sex,
providing a point of entry for the virus.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant link may be that the foreskin is
particularly rich in a kind of white blood cell, known as
Langerhans' cells, which serve as sentries in the body's immune
system. Recent research confirms that they lodge in great numbers
in the soft mucous-covered tissue of the foreskin, vagina and
cervix. But HIV has been found to have a special affinity for
Langerhans' cells.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of protecting, Langerhans' cells become a gateway for
HIV infection. Men who become infected in a sexual encounter with a
prostitute or girlfriend will subsequently infect their wives. In
this fashion, researchers believe, noncircumcising cultures may
become especially vulnerable to a heterosexual HIV epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   If that is the case, it is especially grim news for
noncircumcising societies such as India and China, which may be at
the start of an African-style heterosexual epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   The most convincing evidence to date comes from a Johns Hopkins
University study in the Rakai district of southern Uganda, where
couples who were serodiscordant _ meaning that one partner was
infected by HIV and the other was not _ were monitored during a
21/2-year period.
</P>
<P>
   One arm of the study looked at men who were HIV-negative, but
whose wives or girlfriends were already infected. At the end of the
study period, 40 of the 137 uncircumcised men whose sexual partners
were HIV positive also became infected with the virus. But among a
group of 50 men who were circumcised, not one contracted the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents seized on the Rakai study results, which were
presented here Monday, as evidence of circumcision's protective
effect, but the investigators themselves remained skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ronald Gray presented data Monday suggesting that the
behavior factors associated with Islam _ most of the circumcised
men in the study were Muslim _ may account for about half the
protective effect. The protective effect among the non-Muslim
circumcised men did not reach statistical significance. ``It is not
wise to promote circumcision in the absence of evidence from
randomized trials,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for circumcision proponents, the newfound attention is
welcome. For years, they say, evidence of a link between the lack
of male circumcision and skyrocketing HIV rates has been routinely
ducked, dismissed or ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fascinating that the one intervention that is simple,
apparently effective, cheap and lifelong is the one most violently
opposed by men in this field,` said Brian Williams, a South African
AIDS researcher who is studying the disease in the mining
communities west of Johannesburg. ``There is a strange reluctance
even to discuss it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the link between circumcision and lower HIV rates were
well established, public health officials would still face
significant cultural and social challenges promoting it in places
where it is not practiced, people on both sides of the debate
agree.
</P>
<P>
   UC San Francisco anthropologist Halperin, a forceful advocate
for circumcision for HIV prevention, said the procedure makes some
people uncomfortable because it stirs up images of religious and
tribal identity, topics that frighten people in politically
unstable regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Circumcision is too human a solution,'' he said. ``It's funky.
It's tribal. It's not modern medicine. It is not coming in with a
pill.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Chege, a researcher for the Population Council in Kenya,
said she has been accused of ``tribal imperialism'' for advocating
circumcision among the Luo tribe in Kisumu, a city in the western
part of the nation hardest hit by AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   But Chege, a member of the majority Kikuyu tribe, believes the
findings about the link between circumcision and HIV rates among
the Luo are too important to overlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big issue. It is not something you can just
ignore,'' she said. ``Even a 5 percent difference in HIV rates is
significant, because we are talking about a killer.''

L.A. POLICE PLAN TO JOIN IN PROTESTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &HT;    By ALEXA HAUSSLER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles police will likely demonstrate at next
month's Democratic National Convention, the police union said,
despite landing a lucrative new contract.
</P>
<P>
   Some city officials say protests could harm an already bruised
police image if officers join the tens of thousands of
demonstrators expected to vie for the public spotlight during the
Aug. 14-17 convention.
</P>
<P>
   But Ted Hunt, president of the Los Angeles Police Protective
League, said on Monday that police union members will be creative
and not destructive if they decide to protest what they call a lack
of quality-of-life issues in the new contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not in any way, shape or form jeopardize the public
safety or the safety of the visitors of Los Angeles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police on Saturday ratified a contract that includes a 13
percent pay raise over three years _ higher than the contract for
L.A. County sheriff's deputies _ and improved benefits. City
officials scrambled to try to hammer out a contract to try to
thwart possible demonstrations at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   However, the department's rank and file also was clamoring for
more community policing and condensed work schedules, neither of
which was included in the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's been listening to us,'' Hunt said. ``They are just
flat-out not listening to what we have to say.''
</P>
<P>
   And while city officials agreed that officers have a right to
protest during the convention, they said they would rather that the
police settle their issues in a different setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like them to feel that we have an open and responsive
enough government that they feel they can resolve their grievances
this way rather than taking to the streets,'' said Councilman Joel
Wachs. ``It might be detrimental to the public's perception of law
enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wachs, also a mayoral candidate, said he doesn't blame
the officers for their reluctance in approving the contract despite
the fact that it is higher than many police contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are happy with the economic package that was offered but
there are other things that are needed,'' Wachs said. ``Everything
isn't about money, and working conditions are important.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mike Feuer, who was on the panel of city officials
that negotiated the contract, said the rank and file's issues need
to be addressed, possibly though a third-party mediator.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all recognize that there are some key issues that need to
be discussed further,'' said Feuer, who is running for city
attorney. ``But something like a DNC protest is not the most
productive way of going about addressing those concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, also a member of the city's
negotiating team, said she thinks the officers are having
difficulty accepting changes in the new contract, including tougher
disciplinary systems and more power for the chief of police.
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, ``They got a lot of money and that usually helps
the medicine go down.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Goldberg said she has no objection to protests at the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as it's on their own time, they don't lose their
freedom-of- speech rights when they become police officers,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Mayor Richard Riordan agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's the police union or the teachers union, everyone
has an opportunity to express their First Amendment right,''
spokesman Peter Hidalgo said.

ACKNOWLEDGING THAT RACISM STILL EXISTS, BUSH PLEDGES TO
UPHOLD  CIVIL RIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ In another break from Republican Party orthodoxy,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush acknowledged Monday that racism is alive
in America and criticized his own party for not doing enough to
combat it.
</P>
<P>
   ``For our nation, there is no denying the truth that slavery is
a blight on our history, and that racism, despite all of the
progress, still exists today,'' Bush told 2,000 delegates at the
annual convention of the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   ``For my party, there is no escaping the reality that the party
of Lincoln has not always carried the mantle of Lincoln,'' Bush
said, pledging to make enforcement of civil rights laws a top
priority of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, it was another foray into a topic ordinarily shunned
by fellow Republicans, and another opportunity to distance himself
from the most extreme elements of his own party.
</P>
<P>
   It follows appearances in recent weeks to traditionally
Democratic leaning organizations like the National Council of La
Raza and the League of United Latin American Citizens in which Bush
has touted his credentials as a ``compassionate conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   The GOP's presumptive presidential nominee spoke of ending the
discriminatory practices of ``redlining and profiling,'' of
providing health care and housing for the poor and of expanding and
of improving standards at public schools to end the ``soft bigotry
of low expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   The 16-minute address was met with polite, though hardly
enthusiastic, applause. Eyes rolled, but most members were
forgiving, when Bush needed three tries to correctly pronounce the
name of famed black eductor W.E.B. Du Bois.
</P>
<P>
   The most remarkable aspect of Bush's speech to the NAACP may be
that he delivered it at all.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole
snubbed the organization's invitation as a ``setup.'' The group was
also shunned by President Bush in 1992 and by President Reagan in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Though Dole apologized later in the campaign, his absence
angered some NAACP officials and led many African Americans to
conclude that he had written off their community.
</P>
<P>
   Bush acknowledged the incident in the opening moments of his
address, and seemed intent on not repeating the mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``While some in my party have avoided the NAACP, and while some
in the NAACP have avoided my party, I am proud to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the days of President Franklin Roosevelt, African
Americans have formed a loyal base of support for the Democratic
Party. No more than a third of black voters have cast ballots for a
Republican presidential candidate since President Dwight
Eisenhower's election in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that the Democrat's huge advantage with
African Americans will disappear in November. The only question is
whether Bush's attempts to woo minority voters can chip away at
Vice President Al Gore's support.
</P>
<P>
   A recent NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll showed Bush with 17
percent of the black vote, compared to 71 percent for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those of you who support me _ I see a couple here, I hope
you won't change your opinion,'' Bush to the laughter of the
overwhelmingly Democratic crowd. ``For those who don't, I hope you
... give me the chance to tell you what is in my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush acknowledged that the ``history of the Republican Party and
the NAACP has not been one of regular partnership.'' He added: ``We
are not limited by what we have done, or what we have left undone.
We are limited only by what we are willing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate public response from GOP officials.
Though most Republicans advocate strict enforcement of civil rights
laws, as Bush did Monday, the traditional GOP position has been to
emphasize the progress that has been made to alleviate racism and
to take credit for offering opportunities to blacks and other
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first time that Bush has tried to distinguish
himself from elements of his own party. Last fall, Bush criticized
GOP leaders in Congress for suggesting that tax refunds be deferred
to some low-income workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they ought to balance their budget on the backs
of the poor,'' Bush said at the time, angering some Republicans who
thought his comments provided ammunition for Democratic opponents.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Assessing His Appeal
</P>
<P>
   Some observers believe that the greatest political benefit to
Bush appearing before the NAACP and other traditionally liberal
groups will come not from from minorities but from swing white
voters who are leery of the Republican Party's conservative fringe.
</P>
<P>
   ``What more could you do to establish yourself as a
compassionate conservative than consistently reaching out to
minority groups,'' said David Bositis, an analyst at the Joint
Center for Political and Economic Studies, a think tank devoted to
minority issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bositis predicted that despite his outreach, Bush will probably
not draw more than 10 to 15 percent of the black vote, about the
same amount received by the last several Republican presidential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In accordance with its tax-exempt status, the NAACP cannot
endorse political candidates. On several issues _ ranging from its
support for affirmative action, gun control, a higher minimum wage,
a hate crime law and the removal of the Confederate flag from the
South Carolina statehouse _ the NAACP is clearly in far closer
harmony with Gore than Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will address the NAACP convention tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Bush began speaking, the convention was disrupted by
four protesters carrying signs and shouting their objection to the
execution in Texas of convicted murderer Gary Graham. The four were
removed by security guards as a choir sang to drown out the
disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Bush's popular stump lines fell flat, as when he
advocated a plan for financial assistance to low-income homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind all these proposals is a simple belief. I believe in
private property. I believe in private property so strongly, I want
everyone to have some.''
</P>
<P>
   The line was met with silence.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, several in the audience gave him credit simply for
being there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a step in the right direction,'' said Lewis Woods, an
NAACP member from North Carolina, who hasn't voted for a Republican
President since Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Face it _ they haven't done anything for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Democratic politicians in attendance were less
charitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man needs to show us more if he wants more from us,''
said Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the non-voting Democratic
congresswoman from Washington, D.C. ``
</P>
<P>
   ``African Americans are way past the point where they are going
to give candidates credit just for showing up.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats attacked Bush even before he spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am here to sound an alarm to the country,'' said Rep. Eddie
Bernice Johnson, D-Texas. ``Americans should look past
`compassionate conservatism'' and see it for what it is _ it is
compassion for conservatives _ right wing conservatives.''

SPARKS MORE THAN HAPPY AT HALFWAY MARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Sparks have arrived at the halfway mark
of 2000 WNBA season as the hottest team in the league with the
second-best record. There's no question as to how they reached this
pinnacle in the franchise's brief history.
</P>
<P>
   Defense.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Michael Cooper has preached it from the beginning of
training camp and made it a major part of the team's practice. It's
been put to the test and has yielded positive returns with a
12-game winning streak and a 16-2 overall mark, second only to the
three-time defending champion Houston Comets.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks' numbers speak for themselves. Their opponents have
been limited to a .380 field goal percentage _ lowest in the
league. They are second in rebounds, blocks, and steals.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches' preparation has been another contributing factor,
but it starts and ends with defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The defense) changes each game because each team is a little
bit different,'' Cooper said. ``That's the biggest adjustment we've
made.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players are actually buying into our concept for the games
and they're doing a very good job. ... Everyone is coming in and
just being focused.''
</P>
<P>
   With 14 games remaining, Cooper's Sparks are sitting in good
position with seven of the next eight games at the Forum, where
they are 9-0 going into tonight's home game against the Portland
Fire. The Sparks defeated the Houston Comets once (90-84) and host
them again Friday _ a game which could go a long way toward earning
home-court advantage in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sparks are such a good team that when they get a jump on
you, they will continue to sustain that lead throughout the game,''
said Utah coach Fred Williams, whose team lost to the Sparks 92-72
on Sunday. ``They play very well, they move the ball around, they
created a lot of inside touches with the basketball, but they also
attacked us from the outside. They have so much versatility that
they create so many problems for anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   This could be the year for center Lisa Leslie to snatch MVP
honors. Monday she was selected the league's player of the week for
the second time this season and seems to be getting better with
each game. Like everyone on the team, her defense has picked up and
she's beginning to jump-start her offense. She's averaging 17.7
points, 9.3 rebounds and 2.5 blocks.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just Leslie. Forward DeLisha Milton, Leslie's
Olympic teammate, and swing Mwadi Mabika have been effective on
both ends of the court. Milton and Mabika, along with guard Tamecka
Dixon and reserve swing Allison Feaster, have each led the team in
scoring at least once.
</P>
<P>
   Previously looked upon as the league's most underachieving team,
the Sparks are finally playing at a high level.

feel like we don't get the respect that we deserve and we always
feels like we're the underdogs. I guess we're going to always feel
like that until we actually win a championship, but with that that
keeps us fired up.''

THE STARS ARE OUT IN ATLANTA

   ATLANTA _ If a major league official contacts you this morning,
don't blink, don't hesitate, don't waver for a moment. Just say
yes, you would be honored to play in the All-Star Game, and catch
the first available flight to Atlanta. After that, you can call
your agent and check if there's a bonus clause in your contract.
</P>
<P>
   They are the greatest players in baseball, the very reason there
is an All-Star Game. Mark McGwire. Ken Griffey Jr. Alex Rodriguez.
Barry Bonds. Cal Ripken Jr. Mike Piazza. Greg Maddux. And none of
them will play in Tuesday night's game due to injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Eight players, including seven elected starters are out due to
injury, and that doesn't count Pedro Martinez, who would have been
named to the team had he not been on the disabled list. The only
position where an All-Star isn't hurt is second base _ and
Cleveland's Robbie Alomar, hit by a pitch Sunday, has a sore right
elbow and might not play.
</P>
<P>
   League officials were desperately calling players into the wee
hours Sunday night, and as of yesterday morning, the National
League still was looking for a catcher to replace Piazza on the
roster. ``Our guy, Javy Lopez, went to Puerto Rico,'' Atlanta's
Bobby Cox, the National League manager, said. ``And we understand
that with Todd Hundley, there's a very ill person in his family
that he had to attend to. And we're trying to locate a couple other
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   They eventually recruited Chicago Cubs catcher Joe Girardi,
whose All-Star qualifications evidently were that he is hitting
.304 and was able to find a baby-sitter.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's All-Star selection process includes the nationwide
distribution of millions of ballots, Internet polling and agonizing
decisions by leAPf managers after careful consultation with league
executives and opposing managers. After all that, the final spots
essentially were open to anyone who answered the phone first.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) For an all-expenses paid trip to Atlanta and front
row seats to the All-Star Game, just be the 10th caller with a .280
average ... (end ital)

SAMPRAS ON SAMPRAS: HE REFLECTS ON WIMBLEDON, HIS PARENTS AND HIS
FUTURE 
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 29th graf to correct spelling of Bridgette Wilson's name)  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Less than 24 hours after capturing what he called the
most defining victory in his career, Pete Sampras still seemed
blinded by the flashbulbs from Wimbledon's Center Court. ``It's
huge for me,'' he said, trying to digest the meaning of his seventh
Wimbledon title and his record 13th singles Grand Slam
championship. ``All the slams for me are, but especially Wimbledon.
It has always been the biggest tournament in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by 4-1 in the second-set tie breaker, already having
lost the first set to Patrick Rafter, Sampras thought he was headed
for defeat. Instead he was headed for history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe things just happen,'' he said Monday from a
Manhattan hotel room. ``I felt like it was going to happen at 9
o'clock when the light was going out. I felt like this is it, this
is maybe my destiny. I believe in destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   After a sleepless night followed by a morning flight from
London, Sampras spent 45 minutes Monday with a Times reporter, Liz
Robbins, and several editors, recounting the emotion of the
tournament. Relaxed and open, he discussed a variety of issues,
ranging from his parents, the match that changed his career and how
the shin injury that had troubled him during Wimbledon has caused
him to re-evaluate playing in the U.S. Davis Cup semifinals in
Spain next week.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What were the last 24 hours like for you?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, after the match I did a lot of press and I went to the
ball in my warm-ups and jacket, said a few words and thanked the
people. My head was still at that point spinning, a lot of emotion,
and spent a lot of time with my folks after the match, which was
nice.
</P>
<P>
   So last night I got home at about 1. They had the matched
replayed on one of the channels there, so I was able to relive it.
It was amazing, it really was. It still hasn't hit me quite yet.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So what's the most amazing part of watching your own match?
When you were down 1-4?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I felt throughout the match I was outplaying Pat; for
the majority, that I had a lot of chances. And he's the type of
player who kind of grinds you down. And I played a very, very tight
tiebreaker [in the first set) _ double-faulted a couple of times.
And it's a lot a pressure and a lot of nerves, and I don't care how
many times I've been in that situation, you still feel it.
</P>
<P>
   After the changeover when I lost the set, I tried to reflect on
the match I played against Becker where I lost the first set 7-6
[the 1995 final that Sampras won in four sets). On grass, you don't
have a lot of time to really sulk. You can't afford to lose any
concentration. Down 4-1 in the tiebreaker, I didn't like my
changes. I really didn't. Luck just wasn't on my side. He
double-faulted, I hit a couple of good shots and before I knew it,
I was serving for the tiebreaker and it just changed the whole
complexity of the match.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing that I did any differently. He finally felt the
nerves in the second-set tiebreaker. Once I won the second set, I
just kind of could relax, you know.
</P>
<P>
   Q. At the point where you saw yourself at match point and
winning it _ you're watching yourself in this outburst of emotion.
</P>
<P>
   A. It was spontaneous. It was a bit of an emotional roller
coaster throughout the day. Even in the match, because I felt like
I was going to lose the match at a stage. At 5-2 in the changeover
_ that's when it hit me. I felt like it was going to happen. And
it's always an eerie feeling when you're in that position when 45
minutes before then, I was struggling.
</P>
<P>
   It happened so quickly that it all hit me, the emotion of the
whole tournament, the fact that my parents were there, the
historical impact of breaking the record. I mean it all was inside
of me. But I think mostly that my parents were there, and I knew
that. I was thinking about them throughout the match and the fact
that I was torturing them.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How did you get them to fly over?
</P>
<P>
   A. Before I came on this trip, I mentioned to them if I get to
the final I want them to be there. My dad told me, ``My bags are
packed.'' Every time I get into a final I call and invite them. And
he says: ``No, you're doing fine. I don't want to get in the way.''
He always kind of keeps his distance.
</P>
<P>
   This year I just made it a goal of mine that if I ever got to a
final in a slam that I want them there, I want them to be a part of
this. They're not going to come with me every week, but Wimbledon's
been such a big part of my tennis, and that court is so special to
me. And they're obviously the reason that I'm able to play. And you
want the people that helped to get you there to be there. It was
just an amazing moment after the match.
</P>
<P>
   The last slam they saw me in was the '92 U.S. Open loss, which,
ironically, changed my career.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How?
</P>
<P>
   A. Because up until that point, I was happy being in the finals,
quarters and semis at the slams. I was content just being Top 10 in
the world. But that match changed my career. It just finally showed
me that I do hate to lose. Because I remember in that match with
Stefan Edberg, I gave in a little bit at the end and got a little
soft. And months after that loss, it would just really eat away at
me. I felt that I kind of gave it away. Unfortunately, it's a good
effort getting into the finals, but nobody remembers who comes in
second. And you learn that the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you think that this match will also change your career?
</P>
<P>
   A. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. Just because of what I was up against _
with my injury and not having a chance to practice and not feeling
very confident in the second week of a slam, which is the time I
play my best.
</P>
<P>
   The scene there was unbelievable. It was getting dark, and those
light bulbs. It was scripted, in a way.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. Has there been one surprising phone call of congratulations?
</P>
<P>
   A. I just got one from Dave Matthews. I'm a big fan of his
music. I've met him a couple of times, so he just called. But I
haven't, obviously, been home.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You made the announcement that you would be planning to play
Davis Cup. When did you come to that decision?
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm not sure. I need to let my shin heal properly. As much as
I'd like to think I could play, I have recommendations from the
doctor to take some time off. I was treating it pretty aggressively
to go out and play. And looking at the whole summer, you know, I
need a couple weeks to let this thing heal. And so it's _ at this
point I'm not sure what I'm going to do. I'm going home and get
some more tests done, get some more treatment. But I need to let it
heal properly. I have good doctors.
</P>
<P>
   I need to treat my shins and make sure this is not a prolonged
injury that if I keep on playing on it it's not going to get
better.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How badly did you want to win the French Open to complete a
career Grand Slam?
</P>
<P>
   A. I'd love to win it. I feel like I played pretty well there
this year and lost a tough match [in the first round to Mark
Philippoussis). It's always a priority. It's the one people want to
talk about _ why haven't I won there? _ and it's obviously not an
easy slam for me to win. Next year I'll have to get a good
schedule, and this year I wasn't able to play on clay and this year
I think I will make it a goal to play on clay. I think I can do
well there. And possibly win there. You need some good fortune and
I know at the French I need a bit more. It's not the reason why ``I
am going to play the game until I am 35 _ if I haven't won the
French, I would play the French every year.'' But it is my biggest
challenge at this point in my career.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You'll be getting married later this year [to Bridgette
Wilson). How do you think marriage and eventually having children
will affect your tennis career?
</P>
<P>
   A. It will change my life off the court, responsibilities to my
wife or my kids. When I play it will be the same. I don't see a big
change.
</P>
<P>
   Q. In 1990, when you won the U.S. Open [at age 19), did you
think you'd get to 13?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. In '90, I was so young, and my game at that point was not
good enough. I just had two unbelievable weeks. And I didn't have
the confidence to back it up. I had the post-Grand Slam blues, but
I never ever thought that I'd be here today. That '92 Open loss
changed my career. The ability was there; it's just a matter of my
heart and my mind taking it a step further.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest slam of my career was my first slam. And my most
difficult was a day ago. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ It's probably a good thing that the 10 residents
of CBS's ``Big Brother'' house in Studio City aren't allowed to
read newspapers, listen to radio or watch TV.
</P>
<P>
   That way, they don't know how most people find them: (start

</P>
<P>
   The voyeuristic series has been sinking like a rock in the TV
ratings following its debut last week. With five episodes aired and
59 to go and a reported $20 million investment before the cameras
even began to roll, it could be a long, uncomfortable summer for
CBS.
</P>
<P>
   CBS isn't panicking _ yet. Executives say the audience drop was
expected, mirroring the pattern in Europe where the series
originated.
</P>
<P>
   But outside observers say it indicates the series, about 10
strangers confined and spied on for 89 days, has not caught fire
and probably won't.
</P>
<P>
   And CBS is stuck broadcasting it for three months, like it or
not.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Corday, a former TV executive and chairwoman of USC's
Film and Television Production Department, said she agrees with an
observation she read recently: ``Allen Funt did it better (on
`Candid Camera.')''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a big difference, from a viewer's point of view,
between watching people who don't know there's a camera on them and
people who (start italics) do (end italics) know there's a camera
on them. The true voyeur I don't think wants to watch someone who
knows there's a camera on him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother'' launched Wednesday with a one-hour special
immediately following its tropical island-based hit, ``Survivor.''
It lost a chunk of that audience, but still delivered a 23 percent
share of households watching television and big numbers in young
adults favored by advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   But critics and many viewers complained the first show was dull,
with too much time devoted to profiling the inhabitants and hardly
any time showing them in their new confines.
</P>
<P>
   The slow start cost CBS viewers, with the audience down by half
Thursday night and thinning out even more Friday and Saturday.
Karen, the 43-year-old mother of four, has complained about her
apparent soon- to-be-ex-husband and cried over missing her
children, but few TV watchers seem to care.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, a network would have the option of moving a failing
show, putting it on hiatus or canceling it. But because ``Big
Brother'' is an endurance contest with rules, it offers CBS little
scheduling flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the investment.
</P>
<P>
   With no high-priced stars or writers, ``Big Brother'' seems to
be a cheap production (How much do those chickens laying eggs for
the contestants cost?). But CBS reportedly plunked down $20 million
for the rights to Endemol Entertainment's idea, a steep up-front
expense for a network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually when you buy a series you're buying a pilot script,''
Corday said. ``If you hate it you're out in the thousands (of
dollars), not in the millions.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Ender of CBS said the audience drop follows the precedents
set in the Netherlands, where the concept launched last September,
and ``Big Brother'' contests aired since then in Germany and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually following a similar pattern to what the show did
in Europe. It still provided demographic gains in every time period
it moved into (from last summer's reruns).
</P>
<P>
   `` `Survivor' set the bar very high in terms of ratings
expectations,'' Ender said Monday, noting that ``Survivor''
requires only a one-night-a- week commitment from viewers while
``Big Brother'' airs five times weekly.
</P>
<P>
   After a weekend of steadily thinning audiences _ even against
reruns on other networks _ the best hope probably lies in future
conflicts, romances and the banishment process (yet to begin) that
will lead to one $500,000 winner Sept. 30. Even so it seems
unlikely CBS's ``Big Brother'' can regain enough steam to come
close to the 53 percent to 59 percent shares enjoyed in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   CBS executives would not reveal the projected ratings they
guaranteed advertisers in light of the amazing success of peep-show
``Survivor.'' It is certain, however, that if ``Big Brother'' fails
to live up to promises, the network will be handing out free spots
to advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the public that CBS is going to have to convince to
care about the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The characters are annoying and boring, not to mention the
premise is so totally false and that's uninteresting,'' said
Dorothy Swanson, president of the Fairfax, Va.-based group Viewers
for Quality Television. She, however, admits to watching ``because
when television gets this bad you just have to be there. It's like
watching a train wreck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish I could vote them all off the air at once,'' she
added, referring to the gradual elimination process by which a
winner will be chosen. ``It seems to me they're all auditioning for
something.''

NEW GENERATION GRABS SPOTLIGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mark McGwire and Ken Griffey Jr. can't play because of
knee injuries. A thumb injury kept Barry Bonds out. Concussions
sidelined Mike Piazza and Alex Rodriguez. A back injury prevented
Cal Ripken Jr. from being here.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the All-Star Game needs a different name.
</P>
<P>
   The No-Stars? The Some-Stars? How about the New-Stars Game.
There are 24 first-time All-Stars at this year's game, and some of
them are among the best players in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really miss those guys, absolutely, but the guys here are
All-Stars,'' NL manager Bobby Cox said. ``They deserve to be here
because of the numbers in the first half. The game is going to be
nice, because there's some great players.''
</P>
<P>
   The 71st midseason classic is missing some of the traditional
stars, but that just allows some of the younger stars to prove that
they belong.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of ironic you've got so many young superstars here,
and a lot of the guys who have been superstars for a while are
injured,'' Pirates outfielder Brian Giles said. ``You've got great
young players. Todd Helton, Vladimir Guerrero, Edgardo Alfonzo, the
list goes on. They've put up the numbers and are worthy of this
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they lack the marquee appeal of the likes of McGwire,
Griffey, Bonds and Rodriguez, there's little doubt that most of the
newcomers belong.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to look farther than their numbers,'' Mariners
All-Star pitcher Aaron Sele said.
</P>
<P>
   Good idea.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Jays first baseman Carlos Delgado is hitting .363 with 28
home runs _ tied with Bonds for second in the majors behind McGwire
_ and 80 runs-batted-in. Royals first baseman Mike Sweeney is
batting .360 with 78 RBI. Angels third baseman Troy Glaus has 25
home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Royals outfielder Jermaine Dye is batting .319 with 22 home runs
and 65 RBI. A's first baseman Jason Giambi is hitting .334 with 22
home runs and 78 RBI. Giles is hitting .317 with 21 home runs and
72 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   A's starter Tim Hudson is 10-2. Marlins right-hander Ryan
Dempster is 9-5 with a 3.65 earned-run average. Red Sox closer
Derek Lowe has 19 saves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of young talent in the big leagues, especially
in the American League,'' Hudson said. ``It's a good opportunity
for all the young guys to come out here and show the fans there's
some pretty good talent coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   The new guys might not have the national name recognition of
McGwire, Griffey, etc., but neither did some of the established
stars when they first came up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's kind of like a cycle,'' Sweeney said. ``Maybe some
of the first-time guys this year in seven or eight years will be
like guys like Pudge Rodriguez and Griffey who are here every year.
Maybe they'll be perennial All-Stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they will. Until that time, though, maybe the best
moniker for this game is the Unproven-Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're still up there,'' Delgado said of the
traditional stars. ``They've been doing it for a long time. I've
been doing it for a short time. One thing I'm a big fan of is
consistency. If I'm still doing it in five years, I will consider
myself up with those guys.''
BRAVES' GALARRAGA BASKS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The brightest smile in Turner Field on Monday belonged to
Atlanta Braves first baseman Andres ``Big Cat'' Galarraga. And why
not? The feel-good story of the season has become the feel-good
story of the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga is on the NL team after missing all of last season
because of cancer in his lower back.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no words to express how special it is,'' Galarraga
said. ``From being home sick to going to the All-Star Game, it's
exciting. This year is something really special.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga is batting .294 with 20 home runs and 62 RBI, making
his selection an easy one for his manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, he was our MVP the first half,'' Bobby Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't what Cox expected, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it would be a slow process, and if he was able to
start the season that would be good,'' Cox said. ``We thought maybe
we'd carry him through the first month or so and see what happens.
But right from the very first day, he came in and did all the work
the other guys did.''
</P>
<P>
   While not as dramatic as a return from cancer, Pirates catcher
Jason Kendall also overcame a lot to make it to the All-Star Game.
He fractured his ankle last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means something to me, because I know how hard I worked to
get back,'' he said. ``Last year at this time I was sitting on my
couch heavily medicated with my foot up.'' ALICEA ALMOST AN
ALL-STAR
</P>
<P>
   Texas Rangers second baseman Luis Alicea had a second chance to
become an All-Star when the injury bug almost claimed the Indians'
Roberto Alomar.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar has a sore right elbow, and wasn't sure if he could play.
AL manager Joe Torre said Alicea would be considered as a
replacement if Alomar was a scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luis was one of the guys I definitely felt bad about leaving
off the club for a couple of reasons,'' Torre said. ``He's having
probably a career year, and he played for me. He's definitely one
of the considerations.''
</P>
<P>
   Alomar, though, was determined not to join McGwire, Griffey,
Bonds et al., on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try my best to play,'' he said. ``I came here to
play. I didn't come here to sit on the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   John Blake, the Rangers vice president for communications who is
attending the game, was asked to be prepared to get in touch with
Alicea just in case, but never had to make the call. RODRIGUEZ
STAYING PUT
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, Rangers catcher Ivan Rodriguez said he was
considering changing positions in a few seasons to save the wear
and tear on his body.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, he indicated he's staying behind the plate for many more
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to change positions,'' he said. ``I'm a catcher,
and I'm going to be a catcher for a long time. As long as my legs
and my body can hold up, I'm going to be behind the plate.
Everybody talks about changing positions, but I have plenty of
years behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a catcher is a tough position, but I like to work hard
to keep myself strong. That's what I'm feeling right now. I have
plenty more years behind the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez had talked about going to infield coach Bucky Dent's
school in the off-season to learn how to play second. And now?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably go there to teach kids and probably get some
ground balls, but that doesn't mean anything,'' he said. ``I'm
going to be behind the plate. That's my position.'' RANDY VS.
BOOMER
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks ace Randy Johnson and Blue Jays 15-game winner
David Wells were announced as the starting pitchers for the
All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson pitched Sunday and only can work an inning, but Cox
picked him to start because he's leading the NL in victories, ERA
and strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Randy Johnson's got an inning in him, you want him to be
the first guy out to pitch,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, who's leading the majors in victories, was picked to
start by Torre, the Yankees manager. The Yankees traded Wells for
Roger Clemens before the 1999 season, a deal that made ``the
Boomer'' bitter at the time.
</P>
<P>
   But Wells, sitting next to Torre at a news conference Monday,
said he didn't feel vindicated by the All-Star start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a point to prove,'' he said. ``When
things like that happen you just have to treat it as business, and
don't hold any regrets over it. New York was a place where I wanted
to play. That's where I wanted to end my career. But you when have
a chance to trade for Roger Clemens, you'd be crazy not to.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre, whose team is having a tougher-than-expected battle with
the Blue Jays in the AL East, had the final word.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was just to prove a point, you've done it so you can
stop now,'' he said. A TRADE THAT WORKED
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Dempster had only been in the Rangers' farm system for a
year when he was traded to the Florida Marlins during the 1996
season, a deal that brought John Burkett to Texas and helped the
Rangers win their first-ever division title.
</P>
<P>
   Dempster was upset at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initial reaction was disappointment,'' he said. ``I was a
young guy, I was only with the team for a year, and I though why
don't they want me? Why are they trading me away?''
</P>
<P>
   The trade turned out to be the best thing to happen to him,
however. He was in an organization building with youth, and made it
up to the majors last year. This season, he's an All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out to be a turning point for my career, being with
an organization that took a different route,'' he said. ``I was
able to get some experience at a young age. You never know what
could have happened. I could still be pitching in Triple A.'' nn

POTTER CREATING BOOKSTORE FEVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Weekend sales of the new Harry Potter title were
hotter than a witch's cauldron, retailers report.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble Booksellers, whose outlets around the country
held special debut parties from midnight Friday to 1 a.m. Saturday,
sold a scorching 114,000 copies of the fourth installment, ``Harry
Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' in the first hour.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday evening, the chain had sold more than 500,000 copies _
breaking its previous retail and online records for any book on its
first day of sale.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers ordered a record 100,000 copies through the company's
Web site, Barnes &AMP; Noble.com.
</P>
<P>
   Online bookseller Amazon.com received 389,000 orders through the
weekend, about 18 percent from new customers.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, which teamed up with FedEx to deliver 250,000 copies
on Saturday _ the first day of distribution _ called the effort one
of the largest sales and distribution events in e-commerce history.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com also reported a bump in sales of other children's and
fantasy books.
</P>
<P>
   Although some retailers discounted the title, the sales figures
are still impressive at a suggested retail price of $25.95.
</P>
<P>
   San Fernando Valley area consumers shared the enthusiasm, with
Borders Books and Music in Canoga Park selling more than 400 copies
of the new title and a large number of the earlier books by English
author J.K. Rowling over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Horsley, community relations coordinator, said sales at
the Borders Cafe were ``amazing,'' but Harry Potter may bring
longer term benefits because new customers came to the store.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble's Encino store saw an increase in sales of other
books, possibly due to about 300 children and parents who enjoyed
the late-night debut party while waiting to grab Rowling's new
hardback the instant it was released.
</P>
<P>
   ``While people were waiting, they looked for other things,''
said Jaime Rodriguez, community relations manager.
</P>
<P>
   Weekend sales were not available, but Rodriguez said the store
sold several hundred of the books and had more on hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was far beyond expectations,'' he said. ``There was
such hype about the book, and people all across the country were
waiting to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said a first press run on a John Grisham novel might
be about 2.5 million copies. ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of
Fire'' had an initial press run of about 3.8 million copies, and
most stores ran out long before the weekend did.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, 31, said he read 432 pages of the 750-page book over
the weekend and forced himself to put it down at 1 a.m. Monday so
he could get enough sleep to go to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really, really good,'' he said.

CLIPPERS AND LAKERS PLAY _ SUMMER LEAGUE STYLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SEAN KEARNS  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH _ So Shaq wasn't there. Neither was Kobe. For that
matter neither were Clippers first-round picks Darius Miles, Keyon
Dooling nor Quentin Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the players representing the two franchises won't
even be in the NBA at the start of next season. Nonetheless, the
Lakers and Clippers waged the battle of L.A. at the Pyramid on
Monday _ Summer Pro League style.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers won 88-84.
</P>
<P>
   While Cory Hightower continued to show a solid offensive game,
it was two players _ Laker Devean George and Clipper Brian Skinner,
entering their second seasons _ who impressed a half-full Pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   George scored 27 points and had the Clippers scrambling to make
sure he was covered on the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Devean is playing real well for two games into the summer
league,'' Lakers summer league coach Jim Cleamons said. ``I qualify
that by saying anyone can play well for two games in summer league.
What we are hoping to do in summer league is see if a player can
sustain his effort over the course of the week of 10 days that
we're there. He's showing the maturity and development we would
like to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Clippers summer league coach Dennis Johnson said he can see the
difference in George over the course of a year. Johnson, while
coaching with the LaCrosse Bobcats in the CBA, scouted George, who
played at Augsburg College in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's much better now than last year when he came in,'' Johnson
said. ``He's more mature.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Skinner showed no effects from his left-ankle sprain
that left him sidelined for 43 games last season. He scored 21
points and finished with nine rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   He thoroughly test-drove the ankle, diving for loose balls,
getting knocked down and playing 42 minutes. He said the ankle felt
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``For my first game in five months, I thought I did fairly
well,'' Skinner said.
</P>
<P>
   No current first-round draft picks played in the game. Lakers
rookie Mark Madsen continued to sit out with an injured forearm.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers rookies are not playing because their agents didn't
think it would be a good idea until the Clippers get a coach.
</P>
<P>
   The only drafted rookie who played was Hightower, who finished
with 12 points on 6-of-13 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The game was the debut of Johnson as assistant coach/summer
league coach. Johnson, a candidate for the head coaching job, said
he was focusing on coaching the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to get our team to win,'' Johnson said. ``When
you are out there you are not trying to show anybody anything. I
guaranteed my team if we do this and do that, then we'll be OK.'' &QL;

   FRANCE-PAROLE (Paris) _ France has been caught up in a debate
over whether a criminal, Patrick Henry, whose murder case led to
the abolishment of the death penalty, should be paroled after 24
years in jail. On Monday, the justice minister rejected Henry's bid
for freedom. Henry's 1977 case played a vital role in France's
eventual decision to end the death penalty in 1981. By Suzanne

<P>
   SALVADOR-GARDEN (San Salvador, El Salvador) _ Like a testament
to life's stubborn triumph, a rose garden filled with thick,
fragrant blossoms rises at the site where soldiers killed six
Jesuit priests at the Jose Simeon Canas Central American University
in 1989. Nearby, a votive candle flickers in the room where the
soldiers then killed a housekeeper and her daughter, hoping to
eliminate any witnesses. It did not work. One woman saw the crime
and helped build a case against the gunmen. More important, more
than a decade since the killings, tens of thousands of people from
around the world have sought out the Jesuit residence's tiny garden
to bear their own witness to the faith of eight people they
consider martyrs who defended the poor during this country's civil
war. A foreign journal by David Gonzalez.

   TURKEY-POLITICS (Istanbul) _ The increasing likelihood that a
73-year-old former prime minister will go to prison for remarks in
a political speech six years ago is sending a chill through
Turkey's political elite and bringing widespread calls to relax
laws that restrict freedom of speech. An appeals court last week
upheld the one-year sentence and lifetime political ban imposed on
former Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan on the charge of
``provoking hatred'' in a 1994 speech. Since the ruling, political
leaders have scrambled to diminish the decision's impact on
Turkey's efforts to portray itself as a modern democracy and to
join the European Union. By Douglas Frantz.

<P>
   CANADA-POLITICS (Calgary, Alberta) _ Stockwell Day, the new
leader of Canada's official opposition, offers a conservative face
rarely associated with Canadian politicians: support for a flat
income tax, tougher sentencing for criminals, and beefed up
military spending. But his sudden sweep to national prominence,
culminating with his decisive election Saturday night as leader of
the new Canadian Alliance, seems vaguely familiar, leading some
press commentators to call him the ``Pierre Trudeau of the Right.''

   NJ-WHITMAN-PHOTO (Trenton, N.J.) _ After enduring two years of
criticism for the racial profiling practices of her state troopers,
Gov. Christie Whitman is suddenly struggling with a self-inflicted
public relations problem: a photo of the governor herself frisking
a black man, and grinning as she does it. The photo, which has been
subpoenaed by two New Jersey troopers who have filed a
discrimination suit against the state, was taken by a trooper
during a 1996 trip Whitman made with officers as they patrolled in

they heard his name and caught on that he was that anti-war Sen.
Albert Gore's son, just out of Harvard. No less than the Army's
highest-ranking officer, Gen. William Westmoreland, singled him out
during a visit to Fort Rucker, Ala., where Pvt. Gore was stationed
for more than a year. Yet there is no evidence that Gore sought
special treatment, or that the extra notice he got anyway provided
any real protection. On the contrary, within the parameters of his
job as an Army journalist, Gore probably assumed more risk than he
had to. By Melinda Henneberger.

   CHINA-U.S.-FLIGHTS (Washington) _ The long rivalry between New
York and Chicago has a new front: the Transportation Department is
expected to decide this summer which city will become the take-off
point for a lucrative set of new flights to China. The decision has
added importance because of the increase in travel that is expected
follow China's likely entrance into the World Trade Organization.
Doing New York's bidding is Delta Air Lines, which wants to fly to
Beijing from JFK. Delta executives argue that New York's size and
economic importance so outweigh Chicago's as to make the decision
an easy one. American Airlines, which would fly from O'Hare to
Shanghai, responds that Chicago's location trumps demographics.
This contest, however, comes with a twist: Chicago and New York
could both end up losing, and the airlines' carping may be hurting
both of their cases. By David Leonhardt.

He was also given 3.2 million shares of stock, now worth $31.2

   PHOTO-SUIT (New York) _ The National Basketball Association has
filed suit against The New York Times Co., accusing it of violating
the terms of its photographers' press passes by selling photographs
from the 1999 NBA playoffs. The suit appears to be the first time a
sports league has tried to control the use of the material
journalists' gather at sporting events. It underscores a growing
determination of the owners of entertainment properties to control
their products and any profits that come from them. The Times sold
a package of five photographs of Knick games for $900 on its online
store. By Felicity Barringer.

even great earnings news may not lift stock prices much when the

Philips and Standard &AMP; Poor's, plans to announce on Tuesday that it

   JERUSALEM _ Like Winnie the Pooh, Yasser Arafat loves honey.
Some of his colleagues believe his daily intake of the stuff,
bought at some expense in Yemen and poured into his tea, is the
reason that he is still in action, travelling from country to
country, tirelessly pressing his cause.
</P>
<P>
   He also sleeps well _ five hours at night, three in the
afternoon _ and eats heartily. Though watery of eye, and troubled
by an oscillating lower lip brought on by Parkinson's disease, the
Palestinian leader is still in fairly good fettle, given his
advanced years, his exhausting and dangerous career and his heavy
workload.
</P>
<P>
   Which is just as well. Because the same cannot be said of the
Palestinian state that may, or may not, now be approaching birth _
depending on the outcome of the tripartite summit in Camp David,
Md., which starts on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   If Israel and the Palestinians reach an agreement and Arafat,
69, declares his state _ perhaps on Sept. 13, perhaps later _ it
will be shackled from the start.
</P>
<P>
   When the Soviet Union collapsed, it produced a litter of new
``democracies'' most of which were commandeered by Soviet-era
leaders even before the cheering had died out in the West.
</P>
<P>
   These hard men _ Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus, Haidar Aliyev
of Azerbaijan, and others _ quietly restored their nations to their
true colors as corrupt dictatorships. Palestine is also in danger
of making a poor start.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not so much the human-rights abuses that have
characterized Arafat's rule (though it seems unlikely, he can
always ease up, arguing that tough measures were necessary in the
transition to independence).
</P>
<P>
   The real issue is mismanagement and corruption. This is a
product of Arafat's practice of concentrating power on himself,
shored up by a plethora of security services and supporters who
have been rewarded for their loyalty _ and particularly for keeping
Islamic militancy at bay _ with stakes in big business monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   You need only to drive around the Gaza Strip to see the results.
On a headland overlooking the long, straight beach _ where
penniless Gazan fishermen stand in the surf _ stands the palatial
home of one of the biggest fish in the security services.
</P>
<P>
   Not far away, there are more small palaces, wreathed with
balconies, belonging to top officials. Fed with perks and
sweetheart deals, these men will do all they can to protect their
interests when Arafat eventually goes.
</P>
<P>
   As there is a good chance that no one among those tipped to
succeed him will command enough support to win a fair election,
there is a real risk that the security forces will decide the
outcome _ in favor of their chosen candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Questions such as these are preying on the minds of the
Palestinian intelligentsia almost as much as those that will be
under discussion in the United States this week when Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak, Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton gather
at the presidential retreat and attempt to recreate the history
made by Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat just over two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   The issues are momentous: how much of the West Bank will Israel
return (90 percent is the most commonly quoted figure) and how much
will it keep for the 180,000 Jewish settlers who have illegally
seized Arab land in the name of religion and Zionism?
</P>
<P>
   And what about Gaza, where Israel still holds 40 percent of the
land? How much water will Palestine control? Will it get any of
East Jerusalem _ and if not can there be a deal? Will refugees have
the right to return, and will they get compensation?
</P>
<P>
   And _ when all is said and done _ will the new, independent
Palestine ultimately be anything more than a hodgepodge of land,
without a real army, linked frailly together by bridges or tunnels,
whose population cannot live without the menial jobs on offer from
the mighty consumer society next door?
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians are entering the talks in a pessimistic mood.
They will be seeking a symbolic recognition from Israel that their
new state is based on the terms of U.N. Resolution 242 (which
restores the borders prior to June 1967), even though they will get
less.
</P>
<P>
   They also want an acknowledgement from Israel _ again, in
effect, symbolic _ of the right of return of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The risk is that these matters will obscure discussion about the
quality of the new Palestinian society.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people fought for so long just to be another
stereotype Arab country,'' said Raji Sourani, director of the
Palestinian Center for Human Rights in Gaza. ``We want to be a good
example to the rest of the world and we deserve it.'' &QL;

 By ANDREW MARSHALL  
 c.2000 The Independent, London  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Camp David, once named Shangri-La, was a retreat
for President Franklin Delano Roosevelt from the stifling heat
which blankets Washington in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents ever since have used it as a vacation home, a place
to entertain guests and a workplace where the daily pressures can
be held at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev wrote of the place: ``I
couldn't for the life of me find out what Camp David was. Not even
our Embassy in Washington could tell us. We were finally informed
that Camp David was what we would call a `dacha.'''
</P>
<P>
   The cabins, named after trees, sit on the side of a small
mountain in 135 acres of woods, and meetings are supposed to be
less pressured but also at arms length from the press.
</P>
<P>
   This quaint theory ignores the existence of cell phones: at
previous meetings, both sides have briefed reporters extensively
while the talks were under way.
</P>
<P>
   The inhabitants of Thurmont, the nearest town to Camp David,
were somewhat blase at the flurry of activity on their doorstep.
They seemed more concerned with the local fire department's annual
carnival, according to reporters who had travelled to the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done this before,'' said Wayne Stackhouse, president of
the fire company. ``Reporters and (officials) were all hustling and
bustling around. The townspeople kind of took a back seat.''
</P>
<P>
   All 97 hotel rooms in Thurmont sold out within hours of the
announcement of this week's summit. Thurmont Elementary School will
house the press, with separate classrooms for the Israeli and
Palestinian press (who get on no better than one might imagine).
</P>
<P>
   Reporters and Israeli officials will be staying at the Rambler
Motel; the Cozy Country Inn, where bedrooms are named after
presidents and news organizations, is the other main place in town.
</P>
<P>
   The Reagan Cottage has a queen-size water bed and a
corner-mirrored Jacuzzi; the Kennedy Room has a bidet. The Clinton
Room has no special facilities, but does have chocolate cigars, a
gesture which the owners were apparently thinking of at the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Freeze, who runs the Cozy Country Inn, remembered a
previous U.S.-Soviet summit when Russian officials descended on the
bar and staged a drinking contest with the locals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians won that one, no comparison,'' he told the
Washington Post. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Camp David, once named Shangri-La, was a retreat
for President Franklin Delano Roosevelt from the stifling heat
which blankets Washington in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents ever since have used it as a vacation home, a place
to entertain guests and a workplace where the daily pressures can
be held at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev wrote of the place: ``I
couldn't for the life of me find out what Camp David was. Not even
our Embassy in Washington could tell us. We were finally informed
that Camp David was what we would call a `dacha.'''
</P>
<P>
   The cabins, named after trees, sit on the side of a small
mountain in 135 acres of woods, and meetings are supposed to be
less pressured but also at arms length from the press.
</P>
<P>
   This quaint theory ignores the existence of cell phones: at
previous meetings, both sides have briefed reporters extensively
while the talks were under way.
</P>
<P>
   The inhabitants of Thurmont, the nearest town to Camp David,
were somewhat blase at the flurry of activity on their doorstep.
They seemed more concerned with the local fire department's annual
carnival, according to reporters who had travelled to the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done this before,'' said Wayne Stackhouse, president of
the fire company. ``Reporters and (officials) were all hustling and
bustling around. The townspeople kind of took a back seat.''
</P>
<P>
   All 97 hotel rooms in Thurmont sold out within hours of the
announcement of this week's summit. Thurmont Elementary School will
house the press, with separate classrooms for the Israeli and
Palestinian press (who get on no better than one might imagine).
</P>
<P>
   Reporters and Israeli officials will be staying at the Rambler
Motel; the Cozy Country Inn, where bedrooms are named after
presidents and news organizations, is the other main place in town.
</P>
<P>
   The Reagan Cottage has a queen-size water bed and a
corner-mirrored Jacuzzi; the Kennedy Room has a bidet. The Clinton
Room has no special facilities, but does have chocolate cigars, a
gesture which the owners were apparently thinking of at the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Freeze, who runs the Cozy Country Inn, remembered a
previous U.S.-Soviet summit when Russian officials descended on the
bar and staged a drinking contest with the locals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians won that one, no comparison,'' he told the
Washington Post. &QL;

   BEIRUT _ Having a wonderful time _ wish you were here. Which is
more or less the message on the ream of postcards now selling
across Lebanon, courtesy of the Islamic resistance.
</P>
<P>
   The theme, of course, is predictable: the retreat of the Israeli
army from southern Lebanon and the Hezbollah guerrilla movement's
belief that this constitutes a stunning military victory over the
Middle East's most powerful army. Their celebration is as unique as
it is coordinated.
</P>
<P>
   There are postcards of ``martyrs'' undertaking their last attack
against Israeli troops and of babies carrying Hezbollah flags
against Israeli bunkers; Hezbollah keychains and car bumper
stickers; and pennants for motorcycles, each carrying the guerrilla
army's Arabic logo with a Kalashnikov rifle forming the ``ll'' in
``Hezbollah.''
</P>
<P>
   In one colored card, the Hezbollah chairman, Sayed Hassan
Nasrallah, stands above the clouds alongside his son Hadi, killed
two years ago in an attack on an Israeli position inside southern
Lebanon. Ayatollah Khomeini looks down upon both of them.
</P>
<P>
   Ranks of guerrilla fighters march to their deaths. A toddler
holding a Hezbollah flag clambers up the side of an Israeli gun
revetment. A guerrilla loads a Katyusha rocket on to its rack.
</P>
<P>
   Masked fighters parade beneath yellow flags beside the faces of
Nasrallah and Abbas Moussawi _ Nasrallah's predecessor who was
assassinated, along with his wife and son, in an attack by an
Israeli helicopter pilot.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thousand for each photo,'' the urchin selling the
postcards demanded outside the Hezbollah's mosque in the Ouzai
suburb of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors beat him down to 500 Lebanese pounds _ 20p - a card.
Someone, I suspect, is making a killing. Then again, Hezbollah
provides thousands of dollars a year to the families of their
``martyrs,'' to Lebanon's poor in medical services and construction
work, an entire social fabric which is to be the foundation of the
movement's domestic political future (the next parliamentary
elections start at the end of August).
</P>
<P>
   In one card, Moussawi looks down from heaven, a paradise of blue
rivers and red flowers quite different from the barren hillsides,
polluted streams and overbuilt lands where his men died in such
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   And beside one pile of cards, I found the ultimate gift for
every war junkie: a two-hour video of attacks on Israeli military
compounds, filmed by Hezbollah's very own cameramen. &QL;

   MARJAYOUN, SOUTHERN LEBANON _ Was this what victory was for? Was
this why the Hezbollah lost their hundreds of ``martyrs'' in their
18-year conflict with Israel and its Lebanese militia allies? To
blow up a war memorial?
</P>
<P>
   True, it wasn't much of a garden of remembrance; a domed,
half-eggshell building decorated with a cross and a half-moon and
the names of almost 300 ``South Lebanon Army'' militiamen engraved
on brass plates that had been screwed into a set of concrete walls.
</P>
<P>
   It stood on the top of a hill within sight of Israel, the
foreign land whom the SLA men had been paid to defend. And over the
entrance were written the words: ``Eternity to Our Heroic
Martyrs.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they were collaborators, Lebanese working for their
country's enemy. Some of them were brutal, cruel men who had been
present at _ perhaps even participated in _ dreadful deeds of
torture within the walls of Khiam prison, now a museum of human
darkness on the hill opposite.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the dead were blackmailed by the Israelis into
joining the militia, boy-soldiers whose brothers or fathers would
have been imprisoned if they had not served Israel's cause in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   And I suspected, when I first saw the memorial garden six weeks
ago, that it would fall victim to liberation, that it would be _ I
quote my report that day in the Independent _ ``the first place to
be destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, I discovered just how total a victim it had become:
blasted by explosives, pulverized into dust, even the trees cut
down by the power of the bombs planted around it.
</P>
<P>
   Before the destruction, every brass name had been torn from the
concrete, every reference to the town from which the dead had come;
even the roses from the garden had been stolen. Then explosives had
been primed at the center of each memorial wall and within the
cupola with its legend about eternity.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose I should not have been surprised. When I last came
here, I found a Shiite man cutting away at a brass plaque with a
knife, gouging from the wall the name of Ali Ibrahim Hashem, one of
the most senior SLA officers, a father of three children blown up
by a Hezbollah mine on Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am taking this one because it is still fresh,'' the Shiite
had told me with a laugh. Killing the dead, I called it.
</P>
<P>
   So what was I to make of all this rubble and burned trees and
blasted walls? Yes, it was an occupier's memorial. They were
collaborators. Some of them _ not all, but some _ were wicked men.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Hezbollah could have called it a ``traitor's''
memorial but left it intact. Because the dead were Lebanese. Of
both Muslim and Christian faith.
</P>
<P>
   A few local Christians were timidly videotaping the evidence
while I was there, capturing on film this surreal attempt to erase
history. What was it supposed to achieve, I wondered? And what
comes next?
</P>
<P>
   Are the SLA's enemies now going to dig up the dead? Already, the
Hezbollah are erecting their ``memorials,'' banners at the site of
each guerrilla ambush, listing the name of each anti-Israeli
suicide bomber and the date of his death.
</P>
<P>
   In days to come, it's possible their enemies will destroy those
banners too. And one comes back to the old Lebanese question: if
you do what the bad guys do, what is the difference between you and
them? &QL;

   AIT AL-SHAAB, SOUTHERN LEBANON _ The rocks were littered with
old Pepsi cans and empty water bottles and dead bushes but Haji
Mariam Badran scrambled towards the Israeli frontier wire with the
help of her stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to my sister Sheikha on the phone and she promised to
be here at 11:30,'' the old woman wheezed. ``We have been here
since 10:30. And now the Israelis tell us to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariam Badran's story is as pitiful as it is tragic. In 1948,
she fled Palestine when the Jewish army attacked their village near
Acre. Her sister stayed with her mother. She lives in the squalor
of the Ein el-Helweh refugee camp in Lebanon; Sheikha still lives
in the family home, complete with an Israeli passport.
</P>
<P>
   And on the very day that Sheikha called from Israel to confirm
their meeting at the wire, the Israelis decided to call an end to
the family reunions over the frontier fence.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere beyond the green watchtower and the five Israeli
soldiers in their poncho hats, Sheikha was vainly waiting to see
Mariam. To no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Mariam's son Fadel and grandson Ahmed were with her. It was
little comfort. ``I will tell you how I came to be here and Sheikha
came to be there,'' she told me.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Jewish soldiers came in 1948, Sheikha and I were
sitting on our mother's lap at the front of our house. The Jews
fired into the air and I ran to the back of the house and across a
field where I came across my uncle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't see my mother and sister though they ran into the
house. But my uncle thought they had fled and so he came here to
Lebanon with me. And that was how I lost my home and my sister
stayed there. I can never go back to live there.''
</P>
<P>
   For days, the Palestinians from the Lebanese camps had stood at
the wire in the midday heat, shouting at long-lost relatives on the
other side.
</P>
<P>
   Three young men got engaged to Israeli Arab girls _ Palestinian
girls _ from Haifa by shouting their promises through the barbed
wire. One of them thought the Israelis might permit a family visit
once the couple were married, that he might even obtain an Israeli
passport.
</P>
<P>
   A girl had called to her friends: ``I come from Sabra and
Chatila. Have you heard of that place? There was a massacre there.
You must resist. Don't let us down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis decided to end it all. They shouted at strangers
not to approach the frontier _ a useless instruction since the
strangers are in Lebanon and the Israelis must now remain behind
their frontier fence.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is now driving down both sides to verify a
total Israeli military withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Just down the road at Rmeich there are some very worried
Christian Lebanese villagers. The mother and father of Beshara Said
are standing outside the family home, only hours after 10
truckloads of heavily-armed Hezbollah men turned up to search their
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't let the police or the `mukhtar' (village leader)
into the house with them,'' Said's mother says. ``They didn't allow
the government forces of law and order to intervene.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that Beshara Said was a member of Israel's
mercenary ``South Lebanon Army'' militia, that Hezbollah had
discovered he had fled to Israel and wanted to check out his home.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Said admitted ruefully that, yes, the Hezbollah men had
found guns and uniforms in the house.
</P>
<P>
   In their determination to avoid Christian-Muslim fighting, the
Hezbollah action might therefore be explained. But not allowing the
police to enter the Said household smacked of something else:
Hezbollah justice rather than state justice.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, Lebanon, Palestine. It's the old equation back at the
frontier fence _ with Syria still demanding the return of all the
Israeli-occupied Golan Heights even without its former card in
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   As for Mohamed Badran, Mariam's son, he was watching a swallow
dip and soar over the rocks and bushes. ``I just told my son Ahmed
to watch the bird,'' he said. ``And as we did, the bird flew over
the frontier wire into Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I was a bird.'' &QL;

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new book:
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim the Boy''
</P>
<P>
   ByTony Earley
</P>
<P>
   (Little, Brown, $23.95)
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to describe a book like this, a small gem that
appears without fanfare and quietly puts other novels to shame.
It's the story of 10-year-old Jim Glass, whose father died a week
before he was born and who has been raised by his mother and her
three unmarried brothers, known collectively to Jim as ``the
uncles.'' They are a makeshift but solid family, working their
North Carolina farm during the years of the Great Depression. The
action, like the book cover, is deceptively simple, involving a new
suitor for Jim's mother, a new friend for Jim at school and a trip
with one of his uncles that opens Jim's eyes to the world beyond
the small town of Aliceville. Earley, who writes beautifully and
yet with studied restraint, creates a tangible world with these
characters and conveys the deep and lasting importance of small
events in a boy's life. As always, the simplest stories are the
most difficult to tell - and this one is a triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mountain City''
</P>
<P>
   By Gregory Martin
</P>
<P>
   (North Point, $21)
</P>
<P>
   Mountain City, Nev., is a mile long, limit to limit. Its
business district consists of seven buildings, including a gas
station and a bar. There are no stoplights or stop signs. Only 33
people live there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come and go,'' writes Martin, ``but when I'm there, that
makes 34.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's family has run the general store in Mountain City since
1958, but their ties to the place go back to their Basque
ancestors, who settled there during the 1800s. Through the drastic
population swings of the boom and bust mining towns, they have hung
on, taking jobs that kept them in the landscape they had come to
love. But life in Mountain City is fading fast. Martin writes this
meticulous memoir as if he hopes to preserve some affectionate but
unsentimental sense of his family and their home before they are
gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me,'' he says, ``home is the place I can't keep from
disappearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, by the end of the book Mountain City's population
is only 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Rant, Therefore I Am''
</P>
<P>
   By Dennis Miller
</P>
<P>
   (Doubleday, $21.95)
</P>
<P>
   Are you ready for some venom? Actually, that word is inadequate
to describe the rancorous, sump-sucking (Miller's term) disdain the
author feels for just about anybody or anything at any given time.
Among his targets: people who watch daytime talk shows (''I swear,
you can still see the jelly on their foreheads where the
electroshock terminals were attached''), the war on drugs (''If we
had any actual commitment, you'd be able to look at a map and see a
smoking hole where Colombia once was'') and the film ``Elizabeth''
(It's about ``some chick who's kind of nice-looking, then she
becomes Queen of England and gets all ugly and bald''). Whatever
will he say about football? These rants are from Miller's TV show,
and judging from sales of his previous collections, you'd think
they're very funny. We think what's hilarious in a monologue falls
flat on a page. Of course. that's just our opinion. We could be
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gig''
</P>
<P>
   Edited by John Bowe, Marisa Bowe and Sabin Streeter
</P>
<P>
   (Crown, $25)
</P>
<P>
   Here are selections from the Working column featured in the Web
magazine ``Word,'' which for several years has sent interviewers
across the country to listen to people talk about their jobs.
Included here are a corporate headhunter, a crime-scene cleaner, a
financial adviser, a bus driver, a McDonald's worker, a buffalo
rancher, a diet center owner, a porn star, a professional
snowboarder, an actress, an FBI agent, a palm reader, a plastic
surgeon, a waitress and many others. A UPS driver admits that he
gives lousy service to customers who don't tip well at Christmas, a
gun store owner says he is ``basically unemployable - I have a
problem with authority figures,'' and a paparazzo describes the day
actor Alec Baldwin punched him and broke his nose for trying to
shoot video of Baldwin bringing home his newborn daughter. The
interviewees, many of whom are remarkably candid, are identified by
their real names.

   CYBERSHRINK (Phoenix) - You're struggling with a problem. You
need to get help, but you'd sooner be seen naked on the pitcher's
mound at Bank One Ballpark than in the waiting room of a
psychiatrist's office. Perhaps there's no such stigma, but your
budget leaves little room to pay $100 for a therapy session. Or
your schedule is too packed to take the time. Not to worry. Judy
Gifford is in. And she's in on the wave of the future, online
counseling, which is already causing controversy within the mental
health community. By DOUG CARROLL. Story will move in the ``L''
category.

   MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) {ndash} I don't carry it in my wallet
anymore, but I always know where it is, in case someone with the
government asks. On the back of my draft card it says I'm supposed
to keep it in my personal possession at all times. I did that for
years. My friends and I figured the law would come after us if we
didn't comply. Looks like that has changed. Story will move in the
``A'' and ``K'' categories.

<P>
   (PHOENIX) - You're struggling with a problem. You need to get
help, but you'd sooner be seen naked on the pitcher's mound at Bank
One Ballpark than in the waiting room of a psychiatrist's office.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps there's no such stigma, but your budget leaves little
room to pay $100 for a therapy session. Or your schedule is too
packed to take the time.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Gifford is in.
</P>
<P>
   And she's in on the wave of the future, online counseling, which
is already causing controversy within the mental health community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up, I always wished I'd been a pioneer,'' says
Gifford, who is busy these days turning her Phoenix-based Web site,
www.find-a-therapist.com, into a full-service online counseling
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like (beginitalic)Star Trek(enditalic). I love being
`out there.'''
</P>
<P>
   E-therapy is indeed out there to its critics, whose concerns
center on three areas:
</P>
<P>
   Anonymity. It's easier for clients and counselors to
misrepresent themselves online. And visual cues, often vital, are
lost.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy. How can clients be sure that their words aren't going
out to all of cyberspace?
</P>
<P>
   Legality. It's generally agreed that online counselors should be
held responsible for following the guidelines of the state in which
they're licensed to practice. But the Internet knows no
geographical borders, making codes of conduct difficult to enforce.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no training or research in Internet therapy, and
there's no definition of what it is,'' psychology ethics expert
Thomas Nagy told the online companion of
(beginitalic)Wired(enditalic) magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But to Gifford and other proponents, much of the skepticism is a
natural fear of the unknown. They say that the benefits of
accessible, affordable care far outweigh the risks. Besides, it's a
wired world, and technology is becoming less intimidating all the
time, particularly to a generation that has grown up with it.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Harris poll, more than 60 million people searched
for health information online last year, and 40percent of those
were looking for information about mental health. Some experts
predict that more than one-fourth of all counseling will be
conducted online within five years.
</P>
<P>
   However, a recent survey by Putnam Investments indicates that
Americans are more than seven times as likely to use the Internet
as a referral for advice than as the actual source of advice. So,
the office visit is far from passi.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe counselor Barbara Albrecht sees advantages in online's
convenience but remains skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can sabotage the authentic experience of face-to-face
interaction (between counselor and client),'' she says. ``A
therapist can't assess body language or physical demeanor and is at
a disadvantage. Clients can hide in their defenses too easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, e-therapy is being put to use, and quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's here, and it's not going to go away,'' says Marian
Dunaway, Gifford's clinical director, who has been recruiting,
screening and interviewing counselors from all over the country for
e-mail, real-time chat and telephone counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Find-a-Therapist is a small-business success story that sprang
from Gifford's traditional practice, FindingStone Counseling Center
which has offices in central Phoenix. The Web site began two years
ago as a counseling directory and referral service and is now the
largest of its kind, with a database of more than 6,000 therapists.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford admits being a former cyberphobe. Terrified of being
left behind by technology, she bought a computer from a friend for
$300 and began to play around with it. When she saw that ``the
whole world could see what I put up,'' she kept refining her own
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford acknowledges that online counseling has limitations, but
she says it shouldn't be invalidated on that basis. She's working
to ensure clients' privacy and to secure the services of first-rate
counselors.
</P>
<P>
   With online, her reputation is on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another service delivery model,'' she says. ``The
question is: How do we use this technology and make it the best it
can be, in an ethical, clinical and professionally sound way?''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the whole world may be logging on for the answer.

 &HT;    NO DODGING DRAFT FROM YOUR PAST(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By E. J. MONTINI(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - I don't carry it in my wallet anymore, but I always
know where my draft card is, just in case someone with the
government asks.
</P>
<P>
   On the back of the card it says I'm supposed to keep it in my
personal possession at all times. I did that for years. My friends
and I figured the law would come after us if we didn't comply.
Looks like that has changed.
</P>
<P>
   According to an article I read in the paper, the government now
says that, nationwide, the number of young men registering for the
draft has gone down. ``It is estimated that 88 percent of all young
men who should register do,'' the article said. In Arizona, only 82
percent have registered. No one seems too worked up about it,
however. Officials describe the problem as a ``lack of public
awareness.''
</P>
<P>
   The current crop of eligible draftees started being born in
1975, the year the Vietnam War ended, the year listed on my old
card.
</P>
<P>
   There was no ``lack of public awareness'' in those days.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1964 and 1973, the Selective Service says, 1,766,910
young men were drafted into the military. The first year the
government staged a draft ``lottery'' was 1969. It was on TV. Just
as the war was on TV.
</P>
<P>
   For that first lottery, 366 blue plastic capsules containing
birth dates were placed in a large glass jar and drawn by hand. The
first capsule to be removed contained the date Sept. 14. It meant
that all men born on Sept. 14 between 1944 and 1950 were assigned
No. 1. Many were in high school, or just out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys'' would have been a better word to describe them, but no
nation likes the idea of sending boys to war. So, we call them
``men.'' That first year, the highest lottery number to be drafted
was No. 195. From then on, those assigned numbers more than 200
were considered safe. Those with numbers less than 100 had a good
chance of being declared ``men.'' The ``random sequence number'' on
my draft card is 74.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't know anyone my age who failed to register. Maybe we
thought Uncle Sam would find us if we didn't. Or that someone would
turn us in. Or maybe we were patriotic, even those who registered,
got their cards, then burned them.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't bold enough to do that. At least, not until after I was
informed that no one from my crop of 18-year-olds would be drafted.
After that, the local draft board sent me an updated card. Leaving
me with two. I took my old card to a student rally and casually lit
it up. Like most young ``men'' in those days, I was hoping to
demonstrate the vehemence with which I opposed America's foreign
policy in a way that might impress college girls.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   The women must have sensed it wasn't outrage I was expressing,
but relief. And guilt - at least a little - for being luckier than
guys a year or two older. You'd think that would pass over time.
</P>
<P>
   At the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington D.C., some
visitors leave behind objects. They've done so since the memorial
opened. The National Park Service has 80,000 objects in warehouses.
The number grows each year. Some have left letters or personal
notes. Military medals. Crosses. Teddy bears. A motorcycle was left
at the Wall once. And paintings. Sculpture. Cans of C-rations.
Flags. Even, I've been told, some draft cards.

DIVIDED HIGH COURT RENDERS INCONSISTENT RULINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for
commentary on the U.S. Constitution. His email address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.) 
By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the final week of its term, the U.S. Supreme Court released a
number of significant decisions that gives the public a peek into
the deep divisions within the court.
</P>
<P>
   On June 26, the high court ruled in Dickerson vs. U.S. that the
Miranda warnings outlined in its 1966 Miranda vs. Arizona decision
are ``concrete constitutional guidelines for law enforcement
agencies and courts to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   The question before the high court had been whether a law
concerning confessions passed by Congress two years after the 1966
Miranda decision would override the court's requirement that law
enforcement officials must read the Miranda warnings to those in
custody before interrogating them.
</P>
<P>
   The court emphasized that the Miranda warnings are a
constitutional rule to help enforce the Fifth Amendment's
prohibition that ``No person ... shall be compelled in any criminal
case to be a witness against himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The court further stated that ``Congress may not legislatively
supersede our decisions interpreting and applying the
Constitution.'' Therefore, the right to remain silent remains
intact as a constitutional principle.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-2 decision was written by Chief Justice William Rehnquist,
who has been a frequent critic of the Miranda decision and has
written a number of high court decisions that narrowed the
application of the Miranda warnings. He acknowledged the exceptions
the high court has made to Miranda, but asserts in the decision
simply that ``no constitutional rule is immutable.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a stinging dissent, which Justice
Clarence Thomas joined, that accuses the high court of exercising
``immense and frightening antidemocratic power'' and ``judicial
arrogance'' that reaches beyond the bounds of the U.S.
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia and Thomas would have Miranda warnings scattered to the
winds because they don't believe the high court's interpretation of
the Fifth Amendment can override the majority vote of Congress in
passing legislation to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia expressed his dislike of the court's decision by making
an argument based upon separation of powers and the limited powers
of the federal courts; however, one should not be fooled by this
argument. In their dissent, both he and Thomas assert that the high
court cannot create rules of constitutional status that help
interpret and enforce fundamental rights found in the Constitution.
Basically, that assertion is pure nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has created many constitutional rules on how
best to interpret a particular right. For instance, the high court
has in the past announced a rule on how to determine whether
government has violated the Establishment Clause and involved
itself impermissibly with religion (the Lemon rule); it also
announced a rule on how to determine whether printed material is
legally obscene or not (the Miller rule).
</P>
<P>
   And neither Scalia nor Thomas have been shy in telling Congress
it has overstepped its bounds in passing laws that oppose the
Supreme Court's interpretation of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Both justices voted in the court majority that struck down civil
rights legislation passed by Congress that allows victims of
sexually motivated violence to sue their attackers in federal
court. In a May 15 decision (U.S. vs. Morrison) written by
Rehnquist, the high court said Congress had exceeded its powers
under the Commerce Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   And Scalia and Thomas dissented in the June 28 Stenberg vs.
Carhart decision. The 5-4 majority on the court struck down
Nebraska's law that prohibits late-term abortions, even if the
health of the woman is at risk. Neither Scalia nor Thomas found the
preservation of the health of a pregnant woman convincing enough
reason to overrule Nebraska's law.
</P>
<P>
   In the Boy Scouts of America vs. Dale decision on June 28, the
high court ignored its own previous rulings regarding exclusion
based upon gender. Rehnquist delivered the opinion for the 5-4
majority which included Scalia and Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts of America doesn't want to be forced to admit
homosexuals into its membership. A New Jersey law prohibits
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in places of
public accommodation. The Supreme Court of New Jersey found that
the Boy Scouts violated the state's public accommodation law by
revoking Dale's membership based upon his avowed homosexuality. The
Boy Scouts of America appealed.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the U.S. Supreme Court forced the Jaycees to open
its national membership organization to women because it violated
the Minnesota Human Rights Act (Roberts vs. U.S. Jaycees, 1984). In
1987, a unanimous high court forced a Rotary Club to open its
membership to women (Board of Directors of Rotary International vs.
Rotary Club of Duarte) because it violated a California law that
prohibits businesses from discriminating based on gender.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the high court forced the New York State Club
Association, Inc. to open its membership to women based upon a New
York City law that prohibits discrimination by clubs with more than
400 members.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the court ruled that the organizations' right of
association must give way to the more compelling state interest
that prohibits gender discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   By what rationale did the high court distinguish the Boy Scouts
case from the other discrimination cases? It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The court, instead, focused on the Boy Scouts of America's free
speech rights. Rehnquist wrote that ``a state requirement that the
Boy Scouts retain Dale as an assistant scoutmaster would
significantly burden the organization's right to oppose or disfavor
homosexual conduct. The state interests embodied in New Jersey's
public accommodations law do not justify such a severe intrusion on
the Boy Scouts' right to freedom of expressive association. That
being the case, we hold that the First Amendment prohibits the
State from imposing such a requirement through the application of
its public accommodation law.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts of America contends that it teaches young boys
who are Scouts that homosexuality is immoral and, therefore, it
would violate its shared goals and values to admit homosexuals as
members.
</P>
<P>
   However, as Justice John Paul Stevens points out his dissent,
the Scoutmaster Handbook (1992) directs Scout leaders to refer all
questions about sexual matters to the boy's parents, religious
leader or school.
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, until this case the Boy Scouts of America had made
no public statement about finding homosexuality immoral.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, this activist high court felt free to ignore its
past rulings and New Jersey's anti-discrimination law.
</P>
<P>
   This court, with its ultraconservative triad of Rehnquist,
Scalia and Thomas who are occasionally joined by Justices Sandra
Day O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy, has no center. Its decisions
bounce from case to case _ often depending upon the swing votes of
O'Connor and Kennedy _ so that in the same sphere of issues, the
court may rule one way on Tuesday and rule another way on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the result of a divided court is a body of decisions
that are unclear in their meaning and intent. And that hurts
everyone _ the people, law enforcement officials, lower courts,
legislators and, again, the people.

THE NEXT WAVE: ORDERING TELECOM SERVICES ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fresh off his last success _ the $275 million sale of Epicon to
Nortel Networks _ Steven Domenikos is attracting substantial
backers for his new venture, TeleGea.com. The Waltham, Mass.
start-up makes software to help big telecom companies sell their
services on the Internet, something giants like AT&AMP;T and WorldCom
are talking a lot about doing these days.
</P>
<P>
   TeleGea.com has landed $42 million in its third venture round.
Financiers include Investor AB, a Swedish company with a big
investment in Ericcson; Ray Stata, cofounder and chairman of
Norwood chip maker Analog Devices; and others.
</P>
<P>
   Ordering telecom services online is the next wave, industry
analysts say. They predict individuals and businesses will buy
everything from simple home phone service and Internet connections
to wireless services over the Web, and will set up conference calls
that way as well.
</P>
<P>
   Says Rob Rich, a senior analyst at the Yankee Group in Boston:
``This is really the year, we think, of e-commerce for
telecommunications services.'' Virtually every major telecom
company, he notes, told Yankee in a recent survey that they were
launching e-business strategies in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The phone companies are jumping on this concept, because they
save money on salespeople and mall stores when customers buy
direct. The question is how they'll handle the Web channel.
</P>
<P>
   TeleGea's model is to license software to telecom players _ a
market of about 5,000 companies, Domenikos says _ for an annual fee
that starts around $100,000 and can reach into the millions. It
already has a few customers, including rewardcall.com. It's named a
WorldCom executive to its board.
</P>
<P>
   Domenikos sees this sort of telecom exchange working a little
like cash machines. A consumer or a business can do one-stop
shopping on the Web for virtually every phone or wireless need. The
telecom companies, he says, ``have a huge need to automate their
ability to deliver these services in a more streamlined way.''
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of companies angling for a piece of this
market. Some big phone carriers are working to come up with answers
internally. And hordes of outsiders are proposing a variety of ways
to create telecom ``superstores'' on the Web. One TeleGea rival
that's taking a software approach is Cygent.com in San Francisco,
Yankee Group says.
</P>
<P>
   Domenikos has the benefit of his Epicon track record behind him.
In that venture, he was an early player in the application service
provider business, selling software programs that businesses access
via the Web instead of running in-house. The biggest investor in
Epicon, he saw the Chelmsford, Mass. company's value triple in the
five months before it was acquired in June. TeleGea is 14 months
old.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Hiring has become a nearly full-time preoccupation of venture
capitalists. And it's not so much for their own firms as for their
portfolio companies.
</P>
<P>
   In a step that's become common on the West Coast, Bessemer
Venture Partners has acquired Lexington Partners, the Boston
recruiting and human resources consulting firm. It's essentially a
three-year-old, one-woman show, run by Judy Sundue, who's spent the
past 20 years helping tech firms hire thousands of engineers,
consultants, and top executives.
</P>
<P>
   Bessemer managing partner Rob Soni says he's been trying to get
Sundue to partner up with his firm more formally for ages. He calls
her ``the best recruiting person in North America,'' citing, for
one, her hiring of about 800 people a year for Sybase during its
boom years in the mid-1990s. She's done lots of hiring and HR
consulting for Bessemer in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bessemer tapped two additional recruiters on
the West Coast for the new unit, called Bessemer Search Group.
</P>
<P>
   Hiring, Soni says, ``is absolutely a huge problem for all of us.
Microsoft and Cisco have the same problem.'' The venture firms
aren't staffing up and running ads for their portfolio companies to
be nice. They're doing it to protect their investments, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll go to a board meeting,'' Soni says. ``You'll say,
`Where are we on this issue?' And they simply haven't gotten to
it.'' The VCs have to help start-ups bring in bodies _ at all
levels _ or the business plans they bet big money on can't get off
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   John Hoagland, a venture and tech recruiter at Pendleton James
Associates in Boston, says his firm only began to focus on this
sector three years ago. Now the demand is huge. And in this
economy, it's tough to fill jobs given the flood of new companies
sprouting up.
</P>
<P>
   CEO searches are the toughest, Hoagland says. The best
candidates are looking for top companies, top technology, big-name
investors, and a location they like.
</P>
<P>
   With all of the start-ups out there, he says, ``You've got
people sitting in CEO seats right now who really don't belong
there.'' He adds: ``If you're working with top-flight investors who
expect top-flight talent, it's a thin market.''

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Work for a Silicon Valley company without
leaving the comforts of your home _ be it in Boston or Bombay!
</P>
<P>
   While lawmakers in Washington, D.C., wrestle over how many
immigration visas to hand out to foreign workers to alleviate a
crushing shortage of technical talent in the United States, the
invisible hand of the market is forging its own solution, with a
little help from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Firms such as HotDispatch, HelloBrain, Guru.com, WebPRN, and
eLance are connecting companies with scarce labor. That, in itself,
isn't unusual. What's new is that the workers are often thousands
of miles away from employers. Many of them have never met their
employers, and some don't even know who they're working for.
</P>
<P>
   Take Ben Ruedlinger, a 24-year-old graduate student at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has completed four
projects that were posted on HelloBrain's Web site. Ruedlinger
estimates he makes an average of $50 an hour on these projects,
which range from writing a computer screen saver to helping to
develop ``smart appliances,'' such as stoves that sense when a pot
is boiling. Most companies pay by the project, which can range in
remuneration from several hundred dollars to several hundred
thousand dollars each.
</P>
<P>
   But the experience has a strange Mission Impossible feel to it
because Ruedlinger has no idea who he's worked for. He's also
signed confidentiality agreements that prevent him from discussing
these projects in detail. The idea is that firms don't want to tip
their hand to competitors. This has become increasingly common as
companies come to rely on outside talent to get projects done.
</P>
<P>
   Ruedlinger works from his South Boston home, but he could be
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Guru.com's chief executive, James Slavet, estimates that his San
Francisco company has ``gurus'' from 140 countries. HelloBrain's
engineers live in 83 countries from Malaysia to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why wait in line for a visa and emigrate to San Jose when you
can help design the operating software for the next great Internet
router from your home in Delhi?'' said Bharat Sastri, CEO of
HelloBrain in Santa Clara. ``And the battle in the US Congress
about whether or not to grant more visas could fade away. The
Internet has created a world without geographic boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Fade, perhaps, but not disappear, industry executives argue.
Several hundred thousand information technology jobs in the United
States will go unfilled this year, according to Navi Radjou,
analyst with Forrester Research. The sheer volume of workers
needed, combined with the requirement for physical collaboration on
the most complex projects, means many jobs can not be farmed out
remotely.
</P>
<P>
   But some will be. Corporate spending on outsourcing services is
estimated to grow from $51 billion in 1998 to $81 billion in 2003,
according to International Data Corp. Much of that money will go
toward hiring technical talent such as Bogdan Putinica, a
24-year-old Romanian living in Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another way in which the Internet . . . is changing
our lives and the way we work as developers,'' said Putinica, who
has worked on two Internet projects posted on HelloBrain.
</P>
<P>
   This blurring of international boundaries, while positive for
companies, is raising tough policy questions about wage and labor
standards, said Scott McKay, director of development for
HotDispatch in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in India, the Philippines, or Russia are just as smart,
just as motivated, but they can work for one-fifth the wage,'' said
McKay. ``That presents some interesting legal and economic
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   What if a worker is from Cuba, with whom the United States has
no diplomatic relations? Or what if the worker is from a country
that doesn't have minimum wage laws? And will the outsourcing of
projects to workers in other countries displace jobs and suppress
wages here?
</P>
<P>
   Not all implications will be negative. Sastri of HelloBrain
believes the Net will allow international workers to get
well-paying jobs without having to uproot themselves, while host
countries such as the United States will not have to physically
accommodate these workers.

   Those new wireless ``family plans'' offered by AT&AMP;T, Cellular
One, Verizon and others _ where you and family members can share
minutes _ make sense financially only if your family doesn't gab a
lot, according to a new survey.
</P>
<P>
   Details differ by plan, of course. But Econ One, a wireless
research firm on Los Angeles, found that generally you will save
money compared to having individual accounts for every family user
only if each person in the family makes a total of about 150 to 300
minutes of calls a month.
</P>
<P>
   If Mom, Dad, Bubba, and Sis yack for 600 minutes apiece each
month, you'll probably save 10 to 45 percent by getting individual
accounts instead of a family plan, said Econ One's Charles Mahla.
But if most of your calls are free ones to family members on the
plan, the family plan probably makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: Scrutinize each plan and your own calling
habits before assuming a family ``bucket of minutes'' is really a
good deal.
</P>
<P>
   The same survey found Greater Boston continues to enjoy some of
the lowest wireless rates in the country, ranking 20th of 25 big
cities surveyed. Averaged across plans ranging from 30 to 600
monthly minutes, Boston cell phone users pay 4 to 12 percent less
than people in New York, Miami, Chicago, and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;

</P>
<P>
   The new ``Bluetooth'' wireless technology scheme has come,
offering us all sorts of services we probably never knew we wanted.
It lets us use our cell phones to buy a Coke from a vending machine
or change the channel on the TV set.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, though, there's a Bluetooth-based service that might
make the world a better place: a system to make phones shut up in
places like movie theaters, convention halls, and churches.
</P>
<P>
   Start-up BlueLinx Inc. of Charlotte, N.C., has developed a
service called Q-Zone. It makes Bluetooth-enabled wireless phones
switch to a quieter ring or buzz mode inside a designated ``quiet
node.'' It's coming to market next year, but will only hush up
newer phones with the Bluetooth system built in.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A new ``Portrait of America'' poll by Rasmussen Research offers
another antidote to the wireless Web hypestorm.
</P>
<P>
   When 1,000 Americans were asked whether they could envision
themselves using a wireless phone, Palm Pilot, or pager to get
news, sports scores, and stock quotes, 58 percent said no and only
28 percent said yes. Another 14 percent said they were not sure.
But among those interested, 58 percent said they would take the
phones on vacation to keep getting their wireless stream of
factoids.

TEXTRON HOPES MASSAGING SEAT SITS WELL WITH CAR MAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER N.H. _ If the vibrating bed wasn't enough, get ready
for the massaging car seat.
</P>
<P>
   The product is developed by Textron Inc.'s McCord Winn
auto-parts division, which says two car makers have signed up to
offer the seats on 2002 models.
</P>
<P>
   When switched on, the seat operates via a pump that inflates and
deflates up to 10 small air bladders just behind and below the
driver.
</P>
<P>
   A test ride in a leather sample chair in a company conference
room felt like several kneading hands to the lumbar region. Textron
says it can configure the chair to soothe the thighs as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty subtle,'' says Scott Moran, a director of
strategic planning at the company. But when the company loans out
sample chairs to test engineers, he says, ``they're really hard to
get back.''
</P>
<P>
   Textron has already sold thousands of an earlier version of the
seat to Cadillac, BMW, and DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   The Cadillac versions, a $1,000 option, adjust automatically via
sensors that sample the pressure in each air bladder, then conform
them to a driver's specific weight and girth. The measuring chip is
sensitive to within a fraction of a pound per square inch _ enough
to lower one side of the seat to account for a driver's wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Other designs are adjusted through switches. All of the chairs
help drivers stay more comfortable, and thus more alert, said
marketing manager Ryan Weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Textron won't identify the car makers planning to use the
massaging feature. In addition to Cadillac, Textron provides seat
designs to BMW and DaimlerChysler, and to seat-suppliers like
Johnson Controls.
</P>
<P>
   The seat business is only a small product line for Rhode
Island-based Textron, whose properties range from Cessna Aircraft
and Bell Helicopter to lawn care machinery and motion-control
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue last year was $11.5 billion; the company had income from
continuing operations of $623 million. Automotive parts accounted
for 25 percent of its business last year.
</P>
<P>
   Textron's stock has fallen 22 percent since January, analysts
say partly on concerns the company remains too dependent on
cyclical orders from auto makers. Even boosters like Sanford C.
Bernstein analyst Lisa Shalett rank the company only ``market
perform,'' though in a recent report she wrote the automotive unit
``should prove resilient to cyclical downshifts.''
</P>
<P>
   Textron says its auto-related businesses still offer plenty of
upside. One possibility: supplying Cessna Aircraft with luxury
insides. ``It doesn't make sense for a pilot to step out of a
$60,000 car and into an airplane with a really basic interior,''
says Textron spokeswoman Susan Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   Textron also has developed a ventilated seat, which blows hot or
cool air behind a driver. The total market for the high-tech seats
in Europe and North America is worth around $350 million, Textron
estimates.

NET AUCTION BRINGING TOP PAY, PERKS TO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a employment agency denied her request for more flexible
hours, Lisa Williams sought a marketing job on an Internet site
that offered to auction her skills to the highest bidder. Days
later, the 33-year-old Web marketing professional walked away with
a $35-an-hour contracting job, $10 an hour more than she had been
making. And she was able to telecommute.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was with the agency, a lot of the companies were
insisting that I work 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., but I wasn't making as much
and I had a long commute,'' said Williams, of Hood River, Ore. ``I
was a divorced mother of three who was just starting out (in the
labor market) and didn't have the networks to find my own jobs. The
auction put me in contact with employers I would have never met.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' annual earnings have increased, too, from $30,000
three years ago to about $100,000 including overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year after 16 Internet engineers tried to auction their
services on eBay for $3.14 million, the concept has been
transformed from an online spoof by a bunch of geeks to real-live
marketplaces for independent contractors seeking to sell their
skills for the right pay or perks.
</P>
<P>
   Internet talent or skills auctions have entered the market with
a flourish, vying with job sites, Internet resume sites,
traditional advertisers, and brick-and-mortar recruiters for
freelancers. Some of the most recent players in what is fast
becoming a saturated field: eLancer.com; Monster.com; Advoco.com;
Bid4Geeks.com, an auction site for technical professionals; and
HotDispatch.com, for finding techies here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 30 percent of the nation's 130 million work force are
nonstandard workers, a category that includes temporary workers,
on-call workers, day laborers, independent contractors, leased
workers, and the self-employed _ in short, all individuals who do
not have a regular, ongoing tie to an employer. Of those, 6.4
percent are independent contractors, according to economist Edie
Rasell of the Economic Policy Institute, a policy research
organization in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Rasell says there has been a fourfold increase in temporary help
agency workers since 1982. And, although government statistics do
not go back far enough to fully trace the trend, she believes the
number of other nonstandard workers has increased, too.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the number of temporary help agencies
increased to 1,405 in 1998 from 431 in 1980. At the same time, the
number of people employed by these companies rose to 71,365 from
25,473, according to a report by the Campaign on Contingent Work, a
coalition of unions and community groups.
</P>
<P>
   For employers, the growth in the nation's nonstandard work force
has been a boon, assuring companies of a readily available pool of
flexible employees who can work on demand. For employees, however,
the trend is a double-edged sword: While high-tech and computer
professionals often command top salaries and perks, other
freelancers must scramble for work in a market where the next
paycheck is hardly guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Monster.com and other companies hoping to capitalize on
the rising friction between freelancers and the middlemen who
market their services, by creating sites that permit the freelancer
to set his own terms. They envision a day when nonstandard workers
of all kinds will control how and where they work by simply logging
on to a computer and tapping yes, or no, to an offer.
</P>
<P>
   Monster.com's TalentMarket auction works like this: Freelancers
submit profiles as well as pay and other requirements. They specify
the duration of the job they are seeking. Employers, meanwhile, can
list projects for which contractors are needed. If the employer
hires a freelancer after placing a bid, the employer pays a fee to
Monster.com. The fee is determined by the size of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, people do not need an intermediary anymore,'' said
Linda Natansohn, senior vice president of ventures at Maynard,
Mass.-based Monster.com. ``If free agents can negotiate directly
with employers, more will go directly into their pockets than if
they go to a staffing firm that marks up wages 30 percent and then
keeps a good portion of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Marion McGovern, president of MSquared, a California-based
executive recruiting firm, bridled at the thought.
</P>
<P>
   She maintains that agencies specializing in brokering the
talents of corporate executives and highly sought-after technical
professionals tend to work with employers less likely to take a
chance on an auction, where the talent they get might not be the
talent they want or actually need.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look for the cream of the crop. We do a verification
process. People who are looking for true value still want expert
appraisers who can sell that Renoir for them,'' said McGovern, who
likened the executive recruiters' screening process to a critical
appraisal at Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we use the online world to come up with consultants
for clients,'' she acknowledged, ``but it certainly is not the
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Three months after launching Web magazine Gate39 in September
1999, publisher Shane Stiles of Chicago turned to an auction site
called eLancer.com for freelance writers who were knowledgeable
about Japanese customs and culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the conditions of my bid was that the writer could
write about Japan,'' said Stiles, who hired three writers last
year. ``Last month, I chose five writers out of a pool of 15. I put
in an initial bid of $25 for each short article, plus any banner
ads they wanted to put on the site. That allows them to advertise
themselves.'' He concedes the pay was quite low, but ``through our
Web site, people have been able to funnel traffic to their own
personal Web sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the hoopla about talent auctions, observers say
there have been fewer placements than originally anticipated.
Visits to 30 randomly selected auction sites last week supported
that. On each site, free agent computer professionals and
architectural engineers had specified bid pay rates ranging from
$30 per hour to $60 per hour over the last few weeks. In each case,
no offers had been made by employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``With an auction, you could ask for $1,000 per day, but you
really have to go with whatever people are willing to bid on you,''
said Wayne Cooper, president of New Hampshire-based Kennedy
Information, publisher of the Recruiting Trends newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The auctions started with a lot of fanfare last year, but
there are not a whole lot of placements,'' he said. ``If you go to
these services you will find that a high percentage of the job
listings are actually coming from brick-and-mortar recruiting
companies. So the Web is also making it easier for some of the
middlemen by automating the matchup.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, workplace experts say the trend could bode well
for independent contractors and the self-employed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably a small step in the right direction for these
people,'' said Louis Maltby, president of the National Work Rights
Institute in Princeton, N.J. ``When you can get offers from several
employers, you have bargaining leverage. And that means more
negotiating room.''
</P>
<P>
   Mimi Nishioka can attest to that. Nishioka, 24, of Baltimore,
does niche and target marketing for Web sites and then tracks the
results of the ads she places.
</P>
<P>
   Nishioka, who identified herself on Monster.com's TalentMarket
as ``Mimi the Advertising Queen,'' says she landed a contract job
as director of marketing for picSmart in Washington, D.C., after
posting her profile. She also has a full-time job at an advertising
agency in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning I received bids, but I haven't had any
more,'' she said. ``I think it's gotten really saturated. When
Monster first launched, there was a curiosity factor that caused
interest to go up. Now there are five or six other services that do
the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Monster.com says it has more than 200,000 ``free agents''
registered with the site. They range from IT professionals and
engineers to creative artists and salespeople. Most are new to
freelancing, but some have been consulting for years.
</P>
<P>
   Since she began using a talent auction a year ago, Williams, the
Web marketer from Oregon, has accepted five bids, including one
that led to a six-month job with a Utah company whose
representatives never met her in person.
</P>
<P>
   Williams landed her latest position in March after a
Boston-based human resources manager for Avery Dennison spotted her
profile on Monster.com's TalentMarket auction. Her contract with
Avery Dennison has since been extended to April 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started thinking about doing my own thing, I called an
agency and told them my requirements,'' recalled Williams. ``It
said, `Your requirements are not our concern. Our concern is with
the employer and no employer is going to want to give you the
flexibility you want.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The agency was wrong. After posting my profile, I had calls
from some pretty big firms, and they were completely open to
telecommuting and flexible hours.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    In the brain, as in life, success often lies in striking a
balance between too much and too little of a good thing.
 &HT;    For example, you may think that the ability to keep your eyes
fixed upon objects is good, and for the most part, you would be
right. Thus, when you shake your noggin during an argument, you can
still stare your opponent down. This is possible because of a
small, internal accelerometer called the vestibular sensory organ,
which is located in the inner ear and senses head movements. It
allows the eyes to move in equal and opposite directions from the
head. But a perfectly fixed gaze, as you will see, has its hazards.
 &HT;    
 EXPERIMENT 1  
 &HT;    Go to the mirror. Shake your head, but keep watching your eyes.
They will seem fixed, because the vestibular organ counteracts the
motion of the neck muscles. The net effect is a stabilized gaze _
more or less. The more-or-less part turns out to be very important.
Read on.
 &HT;    
 EXPERIMENT 2  
 &HT;    Close your left eye, and hold this page about one foot away. Fix
your right eye on the diamond below. The green dot should vanish.
(You may need to move the page closer or farther before the dot
disappears.)
 &HT;    The green dot falls on your blind spot, the area on your retina
punched through by nerve fibers on their way to the brain. This
region can't register images that appear in front of it, but you
don't normally perceive a hole in your vision, because one eye
covers for the other.
 &HT;    More important for this discussion, the visual cells straddling
the blind area don't register the huge gap between them because the
retinal dead zone is permanently fixed, and visual neurons quickly
damp their responses to unchanging stimuli.
 &HT;    
 EXPERIMENT 3  
 &HT;    Prove this by turning the lights out and pointing the beam of a
small flashlight up into one pupil. Twirl the beam around while
switching your gaze back and forth. You should catch glimpses of
what look like delicate branches. The gauzy branches are shadows of
the blood vessels that lie on top of your retina.
 &HT;    The vessels cast shadows as light streams into the eye, but
because these shadows never move, the brain ceases responding to
them. Moving the flashlight beam around shifts the shadows just
enough to make them momentarily visible.
 &HT;    But you can't cause images to fade just by staring at something
unmoving, because the visual system constantly jiggles the eye
muscles in a phenomenon called physiological nystagmus, which
prevents the perfect stabilization of images.
 &HT;    These muscle tremors are infinitesimal, but their effect is
huge. Without them, we would, in effect, go blind, tuning out what
we see shortly after fixating our gaze.
 &HT;    It's an interesting notion: Approximate perfection is more
perfect than perfect perfection.

 By KAREN WRIGHT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    On the north side of the Yamuna River in central India lies a
rural floodplain of wheat and mustard fields, low forests and poor
farming villages. It seems an unlikely place on which to pin any
hopes. Yet the site has become a key component in the Indian
government's plans to preserve the Taj Mahal, the extraordinary
shrine erected by 17th-century Mogul emperor Shah Jahan to house
the remains of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal.
 &HT;    About 350 years ago, when the Taj was built on the Yamuna's
south bank, a moonlight garden called Mehtab Bagh grew just across
the river on the northern waterfront.
 &HT;    Once an oasis with fragrant flowers, shaded pavilions, fountain
jets and reflecting pools, the abandoned 25-acre plot is now ground
zero in a court-ordered project to establish protective greenways
around the Taj.
 &HT;    As the land is reclaimed, historians, geographers and botanists
from around the world are scrambling to learn about the magnificent
garden that once occupied the site. With some help from science,
Mehtab Bagh may bloom again.
 &HT;    Interest in Mehtab Bagh has been piqued by increasing concern
for the Taj and its grounds, which are threatened by urban sprawl,
too many tourists and air pollution that eats away at the shrine's
marble exterior.
 &HT;    The lush gardens that once lined the riverbanks on either side
of the Taj may be reincarnated in a scheme to shield it from
further depredations.
 &HT;    Conservationists maintain that a buffer zone of greenery would
keep development at bay, diffuse tourist traffic and help remedy
local air, noise and water pollution.
 &HT;    In 1996, a supreme-court ruling directed the government of Uttar
Pradesh province to construct just such a buffer. Much of the land
for the greenbelt had already been acquired through an earlier
initiative to establish a 340-acre national park around the Taj.
 &HT;    Exactly what form the greenbelt will take has become a matter of
international debate reaching from India to the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. There at a recent daylong symposium
suggestions ranged from the profane to the sublime.
 &HT;    Desh Deepak Verma of the Uttar Pradesh Department of Tourism,
for example, propounded a vision for the new national park that
includes hotels, meditation centers and a golf course. Designs for
Mehtab Bagh could become both the geographic and aesthetic focal
point of the park.
 &HT;    Although historians aren't sure exactly when Mehtab Bagh was
first created, they are confident the site was remodeled to
complement the Taj Mahal. The garden's layout conformed to a
standard Mogul design: a four-quartered garden, both symmetrical
and rectilinear, in which the quarters are separated by walkways of
white plaster.
 &HT;    The white walkways could easily be seen by nighttime visitors
escaping the day's blistering heat. More than that is uncertain.
 &HT;    ``We don't have any direct historical information about the
plantings at Mehtab Bagh,'' says botanist David Lentz of the New
York Botanical Garden. The impeccably groomed grounds on the south
side of the Taj Mahal are a late 19th-century British
interpretation of an Indian garden, Lentz says, and don't
necessarily reflect the horticultural preferences of the Mogul
invaders who occupied the subcontinent from the 16th to the 18th
centuries.
 &HT;    Historians know more about Mogul plantings in central Asia,
whence the interlopers came, and where apples, plums, cherries,
apricots and aspens thrived in the temperate climate.
 &HT;    ``When the Moguls came down from the Khyber Pass, they had to
leave behind their ideas about what a garden should be,'' Lentz
says. Creating gardens along rivers, however, was one idea they
brought with them.
 &HT;    When Lentz first visited the Mehtab Bagh site in October 1996,
it was covered with a tall, coarse grass that had taken root in
several centuries' worth of river sediments deposited by periodic
flooding.
 &HT;    ``We learned very quickly that most of the Mogul activity
surfaces were one to two meters underground,'' he says.
 &HT;    Working in temperatures higher than 120 degrees, he and
colleagues from the Archaeological Survey of India dug down to the
planting beds, waterworks and walkways of the Mogul era and
carefully sifted through the soil there for surviving traces of
plant material.
 &HT;    Back in New York, Lentz used an electron microscope to identify
the species in his samples based on the size and arrangement of
pores and specialized cells in tissue cross sections.
 &HT;    Predictably, most of the plant material Lentz recovered was from
trees, because woody fibers keep better than the soft tissues of
petals, stems or leaves.
 &HT;    The only annual he identified _ cockscomb _ came from the
northeast corner of the garden, where it grew next to a member of
the magnolia family called champac and another tree, the jujube,
that produces edible fruits.
 &HT;    From that corner and a rectangular pool at the center of Mehtab
Bagh, Lentz recovered the remains of chirunji, a relative of the
pistachio. At the south end of the garden, which faces the Taj and
was accessible from a river landing, Lentz found cypress and red
cedar, a mahoganylike tree.
 &HT;    Each of these plants has obvious advantages for a moonlight
pleasure garden, Lentz notes. The cockscomb has bright red flowers
and copious seeds to attract songbirds; the champac and red cedar
bloom at night with fragrant, showy white and yellow flowers; and
fruits and nuts from the jujube and chirunji could be picked and
eaten on the spot.
 &HT;    ``Plantings of the neat, geometric cypress may have alternated
with high-arching, broad-leaved red cedar along the south wall,''
Lentz says. ``The contrapuntal effect of these two must have been
lovely.''
 &HT;    Lentz's research suggests that mango, palm and fig trees were
part of the landscape, then as now. Jujubes that grow at the Mehtab
Bagh site today may even be direct descendants of the ones planted
by the Moguls, he adds. And it's significant that most of the
plants in his survey were cultivated in India before the Moguls
arrived; cypress is the only import.
 &HT;    ``The Moguls were quite willing to incorporate new elements in
their design,'' Lentz points out. In this the Mogul emperors may
have been influenced by the Hindu princesses they were fond of
marrying, he says.
 &HT;    As part of a series of studies begun by the Indian
archaeological survey, geographer and landscape architect James
Wescoat of the University of Colorado at Boulder documented many of
the principal features of the elaborate Mehtab Bagh waterworks,
including wells, cisterns, pipes, channels, cascades, fountains and
pools.
 &HT;    According to his calculations, Mehtab Bagh could have consumed
as much as 70 acre-feet of water annually _ just about enough to
supply a modern 70-home subdivision in the United States. It may be
too much to expect a present-day reconstruction of such a thirsty
project, Wescoat says, now that the Yamuna's waters are depleted.
 &HT;    ``It would be naive to think that cultural heritage can be
pursued separately from environmental protection and economic
development,'' he admits.
 &HT;    Neither he nor Lentz has gotten clear signals about how their
reports will be used in the park's planning. Since Wescoat did his
fieldwork, the Indian archaeological survey has scraped down the
square plot of Mehtab Bagh to expose its Mogul beginnings.
 &HT;    Verma confirmed that some trees have already been placed around
the octagonal pool but says he doesn't know what kind they are.
Lentz says the Taj's head horticulturist won't tell him what's been
planted, either.
 &HT;    But over lunch at the Illinois symposium, he adds,
representatives of the Indian government offered to consider his
findings in subsequent restorations of Mehtab Bagh.
 &HT;    ``The question of what comes next,'' Wescoat says, ``is very
much on our minds.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    In the brain, as in life, success often lies in striking a
balance between too much and too little of a good thing.
 &HT;    For example, you may think that the ability to keep your eyes
fixed upon objects is good, and for the most part, you would be
right. Thus, when you shake your noggin during an argument, you can
still stare your opponent down. This is possible because of a
small, internal accelerometer called the vestibular sensory organ,
which is located in the inner ear and senses head movements. It
allows the eyes to move in equal and opposite directions from the
head. But a perfectly fixed gaze, as you will see, has its hazards.
 &HT;    
 EXPERIMENT 1  
 &HT;    Go to the mirror. Shake your head, but keep watching your eyes.
They will seem fixed, because the vestibular organ counteracts the
motion of the neck muscles. The net effect is a stabilized gaze _
more or less. The more-or-less part turns out to be very important.
Read on.
 &HT;    
 EXPERIMENT 2  
 &HT;    Close your left eye, and hold this page about one foot away. Fix
your right eye on the diamond below. The green dot should vanish.
(You may need to move the page closer or farther before the dot
disappears.)
 &HT;    The green dot falls on your blind spot, the area on your retina
punched through by nerve fibers on their way to the brain. This
region can't register images that appear in front of it, but you
don't normally perceive a hole in your vision, because one eye
covers for the other.
 &HT;    More important for this discussion, the visual cells straddling
the blind area don't register the huge gap between them because the
retinal dead zone is permanently fixed, and visual neurons quickly
damp their responses to unchanging stimuli.
 &HT;    
 EXPERIMENT 3  
 &HT;    Prove this by turning the lights out and pointing the beam of a
small flashlight up into one pupil. Twirl the beam around while
switching your gaze back and forth. You should catch glimpses of
what look like delicate branches. The gauzy branches are shadows of
the blood vessels that lie on top of your retina.
 &HT;    The vessels cast shadows as light streams into the eye, but
because these shadows never move, the brain ceases responding to
them. Moving the flashlight beam around shifts the shadows just
enough to make them momentarily visible.
 &HT;    But you can't cause images to fade just by staring at something
unmoving, because the visual system constantly jiggles the eye
muscles in a phenomenon called physiological nystagmus, which
prevents the perfect stabilization of images.
 &HT;    These muscle tremors are infinitesimal, but their effect is
huge. Without them, we would, in effect, go blind, tuning out what
we see shortly after fixating our gaze.
 &HT;    It's an interesting notion: Approximate perfection is more
perfect than perfect perfection.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    On the north side of the Yamuna River in central India lies a
rural floodplain of wheat and mustard fields, low forests and poor
farming villages. It seems an unlikely place on which to pin any
hopes. Yet the site has become a key component in the Indian
government's plans to preserve the Taj Mahal, the extraordinary
shrine erected by 17th-century Mogul emperor Shah Jahan to house
the remains of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal.
 &HT;    About 350 years ago, when the Taj was built on the Yamuna's
south bank, a moonlight garden called Mehtab Bagh grew just across
the river on the northern waterfront.
 &HT;    Once an oasis with fragrant flowers, shaded pavilions, fountain
jets and reflecting pools, the abandoned 25-acre plot is now ground
zero in a court-ordered project to establish protective greenways
around the Taj.
 &HT;    As the land is reclaimed, historians, geographers and botanists
from around the world are scrambling to learn about the magnificent
garden that once occupied the site. With some help from science,
Mehtab Bagh may bloom again.
 &HT;    Interest in Mehtab Bagh has been piqued by increasing concern
for the Taj and its grounds, which are threatened by urban sprawl,
too many tourists and air pollution that eats away at the shrine's
marble exterior.
 &HT;    The lush gardens that once lined the riverbanks on either side
of the Taj may be reincarnated in a scheme to shield it from
further depredations.
 &HT;    Conservationists maintain that a buffer zone of greenery would
keep development at bay, diffuse tourist traffic and help remedy
local air, noise and water pollution.
 &HT;    In 1996, a supreme-court ruling directed the government of Uttar
Pradesh province to construct just such a buffer. Much of the land
for the greenbelt had already been acquired through an earlier
initiative to establish a 340-acre national park around the Taj.
 &HT;    Exactly what form the greenbelt will take has become a matter of
international debate reaching from India to the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. There at a recent daylong symposium
suggestions ranged from the profane to the sublime.
 &HT;    Desh Deepak Verma of the Uttar Pradesh Department of Tourism,
for example, propounded a vision for the new national park that
includes hotels, meditation centers and a golf course. Designs for
Mehtab Bagh could become both the geographic and aesthetic focal
point of the park.
 &HT;    Although historians aren't sure exactly when Mehtab Bagh was
first created, they are confident the site was remodeled to
complement the Taj Mahal. The garden's layout conformed to a
standard Mogul design: a four-quartered garden, both symmetrical
and rectilinear, in which the quarters are separated by walkways of
white plaster.
 &HT;    The white walkways could easily be seen by nighttime visitors
escaping the day's blistering heat. More than that is uncertain.
 &HT;    ``We don't have any direct historical information about the
plantings at Mehtab Bagh,'' says botanist David Lentz of the New
York Botanical Garden. The impeccably groomed grounds on the south
side of the Taj Mahal are a late 19th-century British
interpretation of an Indian garden, Lentz says, and don't
necessarily reflect the horticultural preferences of the Mogul
invaders who occupied the subcontinent from the 16th to the 18th
centuries.
 &HT;    Historians know more about Mogul plantings in central Asia,
whence the interlopers came, and where apples, plums, cherries,
apricots and aspens thrived in the temperate climate.
 &HT;    ``When the Moguls came down from the Khyber Pass, they had to
leave behind their ideas about what a garden should be,'' Lentz
says. Creating gardens along rivers, however, was one idea they
brought with them.
 &HT;    When Lentz first visited the Mehtab Bagh site in October 1996,
it was covered with a tall, coarse grass that had taken root in
several centuries' worth of river sediments deposited by periodic
flooding.
 &HT;    ``We learned very quickly that most of the Mogul activity
surfaces were one to two meters underground,'' he says.
 &HT;    Working in temperatures higher than 120 degrees, he and
colleagues from the Archaeological Survey of India dug down to the
planting beds, waterworks and walkways of the Mogul era and
carefully sifted through the soil there for surviving traces of
plant material.
 &HT;    Back in New York, Lentz used an electron microscope to identify
the species in his samples based on the size and arrangement of
pores and specialized cells in tissue cross sections.
 &HT;    Predictably, most of the plant material Lentz recovered was from
trees, because woody fibers keep better than the soft tissues of
petals, stems or leaves.
 &HT;    The only annual he identified _ cockscomb _ came from the
northeast corner of the garden, where it grew next to a member of
the magnolia family called champac and another tree, the jujube,
that produces edible fruits.
 &HT;    From that corner and a rectangular pool at the center of Mehtab
Bagh, Lentz recovered the remains of chirunji, a relative of the
pistachio. At the south end of the garden, which faces the Taj and
was accessible from a river landing, Lentz found cypress and red
cedar, a mahoganylike tree.
 &HT;    Each of these plants has obvious advantages for a moonlight
pleasure garden, Lentz notes. The cockscomb has bright red flowers
and copious seeds to attract songbirds; the champac and red cedar
bloom at night with fragrant, showy white and yellow flowers; and
fruits and nuts from the jujube and chirunji could be picked and
eaten on the spot.
 &HT;    ``Plantings of the neat, geometric cypress may have alternated
with high-arching, broad-leaved red cedar along the south wall,''
Lentz says. ``The contrapuntal effect of these two must have been
lovely.''
 &HT;    Lentz's research suggests that mango, palm and fig trees were
part of the landscape, then as now. Jujubes that grow at the Mehtab
Bagh site today may even be direct descendants of the ones planted
by the Moguls, he adds. And it's significant that most of the
plants in his survey were cultivated in India before the Moguls
arrived; cypress is the only import.
 &HT;    ``The Moguls were quite willing to incorporate new elements in
their design,'' Lentz points out. In this the Mogul emperors may
have been influenced by the Hindu princesses they were fond of
marrying, he says.
 &HT;    As part of a series of studies begun by the Indian
archaeological survey, geographer and landscape architect James
Wescoat of the University of Colorado at Boulder documented many of
the principal features of the elaborate Mehtab Bagh waterworks,
including wells, cisterns, pipes, channels, cascades, fountains and
pools.
 &HT;    According to his calculations, Mehtab Bagh could have consumed
as much as 70 acre-feet of water annually _ just about enough to
supply a modern 70-home subdivision in the United States. It may be
too much to expect a present-day reconstruction of such a thirsty
project, Wescoat says, now that the Yamuna's waters are depleted.
 &HT;    ``It would be naive to think that cultural heritage can be
pursued separately from environmental protection and economic
development,'' he admits.
 &HT;    Neither he nor Lentz has gotten clear signals about how their
reports will be used in the park's planning. Since Wescoat did his
fieldwork, the Indian archaeological survey has scraped down the
square plot of Mehtab Bagh to expose its Mogul beginnings.
 &HT;    Verma confirmed that some trees have already been placed around
the octagonal pool but says he doesn't know what kind they are.
Lentz says the Taj's head horticulturist won't tell him what's been
planted, either.
 &HT;    But over lunch at the Illinois symposium, he adds,
representatives of the Indian government offered to consider his
findings in subsequent restorations of Mehtab Bagh.
 &HT;    ``The question of what comes next,'' Wescoat says, ``is very
much on our minds.''

necessarily reflect the horticultural preferences of the Mogul
invaders who occupied the subcontinent from the 16th to the 18th
centuries.
 &HT;    Historians know more about Mogul plantings in central Asia,
whence the interlopers came, and where apples, plums, cherries,
apricots and aspens thrived in the temperate climate.
 &HT;    ``When the Moguls came down from the Khyber Pass, they had to
leave behind their ideas about what a garden should be,'' Lentz
says. Creating gardens along rivers, however, was one idea they
brought with them.
 &HT;    When Lentz first visited the Mehtab Bagh site in October 1996,
it was covered with a tall, coarse grass that had taken root in
several centuries' worth of river sediments deposited by periodic
flooding.
 &HT;    ``We learned very quickly that most of the Mogul activity
surfaces were one to two meters underground,'' he says.
 &HT;    Working in temperatures higher than 120 degrees, he and
colleagues from the Archaeological Survey of India dug down to the
planting beds, waterworks and walkways of the Mogul era and
carefully sifted through the soil there for surviving traces of
plant material.
 &HT;    Back in New York, Lentz used an electron microscope to identify
the species in his samples based on the size and arrangement of
pores and specialized cells in tissue cross sections.
 &HT;    Predictably, most of the plant material Lentz recovered was from
trees, because woody fibers keep better than the soft tissues of
petals, stems or leaves.
 &HT;    The only annual he identified _ cockscomb _ came from the
northeast corner of the garden, where it grew next to a member of
the magnolia family called champac and another tree, the jujube,
that produces edible fruits.
 &HT;    From that corner and a rectangular pool at the center of Mehtab
Bagh, Lentz recovered the remains of chirunji, a relative of the
pistachio. At the south end of the garden, which faces the Taj and
was accessible from a river landing, Lentz found cypress and red
cedar, a mahoganylike tree.
 &HT;    Each of these plants has obvious advantages for a moonlight
pleasure garden, Lentz notes. The cockscomb has bright red flowers
and copious seeds to attract songbirds; the champac and red cedar
bloom at night with fragrant, showy white and yellow flowers; and
fruits and nuts from the jujube and chirunji could be picked and
eaten on the spot.
 &HT;    ``Plantings of the neat, geometric cypress may have alternated
with high-arching, broad-leaved red cedar along the south wall,''
Lentz says. ``The contrapuntal effect of these two must have been
lovely.''
 &HT;    Lentz's research suggests that mango, palm and fig trees were
part of the landscape, then as now. Jujubes that grow at the Mehtab
Bagh site today may even be direct descendants of the ones planted
by the Moguls, he adds. And it's significant that most of the
plants in his survey were cultivated in India before the Moguls
arrived; cypress is the only import.
 &HT;    ``The Moguls were quite willing to incorporate new elements in
their design,'' Lentz points out. In this the Mogul emperors may
have been influenced by the Hindu princesses they were fond of
marrying, he says.
 &HT;    As part of a series of studies begun by the Indian
archaeological survey, geographer and landscape architect James
Wescoat of the University of Colorado at Boulder documented many of
the principal features of the elaborate Mehtab Bagh waterworks,
including wells, cisterns, pipes, channels, cascades, fountains and
pools.
 &HT;    According to his calculations, Mehtab Bagh could have consumed
as much as 70 acre-feet of water annually _ just about enough to
supply a modern 70-home subdivision in the United States. It may be
too much to expect a present-day reconstruction of such a thirsty
project, Wescoat says, now that the Yamuna's waters are depleted.
 &HT;    ``It would be naive to think that cultural heritage can be
pursued separately from environmental protection and economic
development,'' he admits.
 &HT;    Neither he nor Lentz has gotten clear signals about how their
reports will be used in the park's planning. Since Wescoat did his
fieldwork, the Indian archaeological survey has scraped down the
square plot of Mehtab Bagh to expose its Mogul beginnings.
 &HT;    Verma confirmed that some trees have already been placed around
the octagonal pool but says he doesn't know what kind they are.
Lentz says the Taj's head horticulturist won't tell him what's been
planted, either.
 &HT;    But over lunch at the Illinois symposium, he adds,
representatives of the Indian government offered to consider his
findings in subsequent restorations of Mehtab Bagh.
 &HT;    ``The question of what comes next,'' Wescoat says, ``is very
much on our minds.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    On the north side of the Yamuna River in central India lies a
rural floodplain of wheat and mustard fields, low forests and poor
farming villages. It seems an unlikely place on which to pin any
hopes. Yet the site has become a key component in the Indian
government's plans to preserve the Taj Mahal, the extraordinary
shrine erected by 17th-century Mogul emperor Shah Jahan to house
the remains of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal.
 &HT;    About 350 years ago, when the Taj was built on the Yamuna's
south bank, a moonlight garden called Mehtab Bagh grew just across
the river on the northern waterfront.
 &HT;    Once an oasis with fragrant flowers, shaded pavilions, fountain
jets and reflecting pools, the abandoned 25-acre plot is now ground
zero in a court-ordered project to establish protective greenways
around the Taj.
 &HT;    As the land is reclaimed, historians, geographers and botanists
from around the world are scrambling to learn about the magnificent
garden that once occupied the site. With some help from science,
Mehtab Bagh may bloom again.
 &HT;    Interest in Mehtab Bagh has been piqued by increasing concern
for the Taj and its grounds, which are threatened by urban sprawl,
too many tourists and air pollution that eats away at the shrine's
marble exterior.
 &HT;    The lush gardens that once lined the riverbanks on either side
of the Taj may be reincarnated in a scheme to shield it from
further depredations.
 &HT;    Conservationists maintain that a buffer zone of greenery would
keep development at bay, diffuse tourist traffic and help remedy
local air, noise and water pollution.
 &HT;    In 1996, a supreme-court ruling directed the government of Uttar
Pradesh province to construct just such a buffer. Much of the land
for the greenbelt had already been acquired through an earlier
initiative to establish a 340-acre national park around the Taj.
 &HT;    Exactly what form the greenbelt will take has become a matter of
international debate reaching from India to the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. There at a recent daylong symposium
suggestions ranged from the profane to the sublime.
 &HT;    Desh Deepak Verma of the Uttar Pradesh Department of Tourism,
for example, propounded a vision for the new national park that
includes hotels, meditation centers and a golf course. Designs for
Mehtab Bagh could become both the geographic and aesthetic focal
point of the park.
 &HT;    Although historians aren't sure exactly when Mehtab Bagh was
first created, they are confident the site was remodeled to
complement the Taj Mahal. The garden's layout conformed to a
standard Mogul design: a four-quartered garden, both symmetrical
and rectilinear, in which the quarters are separated by walkways of
white plaster.
 &HT;    The white walkways could easily be seen by nighttime visitors
escaping the day's blistering heat. More than that is uncertain.
 &HT;    ``We don't have any direct historical information about the
plantings at Mehtab Bagh,'' says botanist David Lentz of the New
York Botanical Garden. The impeccably groomed grounds on the south
side of the Taj Mahal are a late 19th-century British
interpretation of an Indian garden, Lentz says, and don't
necessarily reflect the horticultural preferences of the Mogul
invaders who occupied the subcontinent from the 16th to the 18th
centuries.

point of the park.
 &HT;    Although historians aren't sure exactly when Mehtab Bagh was
first created, they are confident the site was remodeled to
complement the Taj Mahal. The garden's layout conformed to a
standard Mogul design: a four-quartered garden, both symmetrical
and rectilinear, in which the quarters are separated by walkways of
white plaster.
 &HT;    The white walkways could easily be seen by nighttime visitors
escaping the day's blistering heat. More than that is uncertain.
 &HT;    ``We don't have any direct historical information about the
plantings at Mehtab Bagh,'' says botanist David Lentz of the New
York Botanical Garden. The impeccably groomed grounds on the south
side of the Taj Mahal are a late 19th-century British
interpretation of an Indian garden, Lentz says, and don't
necessarily reflect the horticultural preferences of the Mogul
invaders who occupied the subcontinent from the 16th to the 18th
centuries.
 &HT;    Historians know more about Mogul plantings in central Asia,
whence the interlopers came, and where apples, plums, cherries,
apricots and aspens thrived in the temperate climate.
 &HT;    ``When the Moguls came down from the Khyber Pass, they had to
leave behind their ideas about what a garden should be,'' Lentz
says. Creating gardens along rivers, however, was one idea they
brought with them.
 &HT;    When Lentz first visited the Mehtab Bagh site in October 1996,
it was covered with a tall, coarse grass that had taken root in
several centuries' worth of river sediments deposited by periodic
flooding.
 &HT;    ``We learned very quickly that most of the Mogul activity
surfaces were one to two meters underground,'' he says.
 &HT;    Working in temperatures higher than 120 degrees, he and
colleagues from the Archaeological Survey of India dug down to the
planting beds, waterworks and walkways of the Mogul era and
carefully sifted through the soil there for surviving traces of
plant material.
 &HT;    Back in New York, Lentz used an electron microscope to identify
the species in his samples based on the size and arrangement of
pores and specialized cells in tissue cross sections.
 &HT;    Predictably, most of the plant material Lentz recovered was from
trees, because woody fibers keep better than the soft tissues of
petals, stems or leaves.
 &HT;    The only annual he identified _ cockscomb _ came from the
northeast corner of the garden, where it grew next to a member of
the magnolia family called champac and another tree, the jujube,
that produces edible fruits.
 &HT;    From that corner and a rectangular pool at the center of Mehtab
Bagh, Lentz recovered the remains of chirunji, a relative of the
pistachio. At the south end of the garden, which faces the Taj and
was accessible from a river landing, Lentz found cypress and red
cedar, a mahoganylike tree.
 &HT;    Each of these plants has obvious advantages for a moonlight
pleasure garden, Lentz notes. The cockscomb has bright red flowers
and copious seeds to attract songbirds; the champac and red cedar
bloom at night with fragrant, showy white and yellow flowers; and
fruits and nuts from the jujube and chirunji could be picked and
eaten on the spot.
 &HT;    ``Plantings of the neat, geometric cypress may have alternated
with high-arching, broad-leaved red cedar along the south wall,''
Lentz says. ``The contrapuntal effect of these two must have been
lovely.''
 &HT;    Lentz's research suggests that mango, palm and fig trees were
part of the landscape, then as now. Jujubes that grow at the Mehtab
Bagh site today may even be direct descendants of the ones planted
by the Moguls, he adds. And it's significant that most of the
plants in his survey were cultivated in India before the Moguls
arrived; cypress is the only import.
 &HT;    ``The Moguls were quite willing to incorporate new elements in
their design,'' Lentz points out. In this the Mogul emperors may
have been influenced by the Hindu princesses they were fond of
marrying, he says.
 &HT;    As part of a series of studies begun by the Indian
archaeological survey, geographer and landscape architect James
Wescoat of the University of Colorado at Boulder documented many of
the principal features of the elaborate Mehtab Bagh waterworks,
including wells, cisterns, pipes, channels, cascades, fountains and
pools.
 &HT;    According to his calculations, Mehtab Bagh could have consumed
as much as 70 acre-feet of water annually _ just about enough to
supply a modern 70-home subdivision in the United States. It may be
too much to expect a present-day reconstruction of such a thirsty
project, Wescoat says, now that the Yamuna's waters are depleted.
 &HT;    ``It would be naive to think that cultural heritage can be
pursued separately from environmental protection and economic
development,'' he admits.
 &HT;    Neither he nor Lentz has gotten clear signals about how their
reports will be used in the park's planning. Since Wescoat did his
fieldwork, the Indian archaeological survey has scraped down the
square plot of Mehtab Bagh to expose its Mogul beginnings.
 &HT;    Verma confirmed that some trees have already been placed around
the octagonal pool but says he doesn't know what kind they are.
Lentz says the Taj's head horticulturist won't tell him what's been
planted, either.
 &HT;    But over lunch at the Illinois symposium, he adds,
representatives of the Indian government offered to consider his
findings in subsequent restorations of Mehtab Bagh.
 &HT;    ``The question of what comes next,'' Wescoat says, ``is very
much on our minds.''

 By KAREN WRIGHT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    On the north side of the Yamuna River in central India lies a
rural floodplain of wheat and mustard fields, low forests and poor
farming villages. It seems an unlikely place on which to pin any
hopes. Yet the site has become a key component in the Indian
government's plans to preserve the Taj Mahal, the extraordinary
shrine erected by 17th-century Mogul emperor Shah Jahan to house
the remains of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal.
 &HT;    About 350 years ago, when the Taj was built on the Yamuna's
south bank, a moonlight garden called Mehtab Bagh grew just across
the river on the northern waterfront.
 &HT;    Once an oasis with fragrant flowers, shaded pavilions, fountain
jets and reflecting pools, the abandoned 25-acre plot is now ground
zero in a court-ordered project to establish protective greenways
around the Taj.
 &HT;    As the land is reclaimed, historians, geographers and botanists
from around the world are scrambling to learn about the magnificent
garden that once occupied the site. With some help from science,
Mehtab Bagh may bloom again.
 &HT;    Interest in Mehtab Bagh has been piqued by increasing concern
for the Taj and its grounds, which are threatened by urban sprawl,
too many tourists and air pollution that eats away at the shrine's
marble exterior.
 &HT;    The lush gardens that once lined the riverbanks on either side
of the Taj may be reincarnated in a scheme to shield it from
further depredations.
 &HT;    Conservationists maintain that a buffer zone of greenery would
keep development at bay, diffuse tourist traffic and help remedy
local air, noise and water pollution.
 &HT;    In 1996, a supreme-court ruling directed the government of Uttar
Pradesh province to construct just such a buffer. Much of the land
for the greenbelt had already been acquired through an earlier
initiative to establish a 340-acre national park around the Taj.
 &HT;    Exactly what form the greenbelt will take has become a matter of
international debate reaching from India to the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. There at a recent daylong symposium
suggestions ranged from the profane to the sublime.
 &HT;    Desh Deepak Verma of the Uttar Pradesh Department of Tourism,
for example, propounded a vision for the new national park that
includes hotels, meditation centers and a golf course. Designs for
Mehtab Bagh could become both the geographic and aesthetic focal
point of the park.
 &HT;    Although historians aren't sure exactly when Mehtab Bagh was
first created, they are confident the site was remodeled to
complement the Taj Mahal. The garden's layout conformed to a
standard Mogul design: a four-quartered garden, both symmetrical
and rectilinear, in which the quarters are separated by walkways of

 By ERIC WILSON 
 From W magazine) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ While Liz Claiborne _ the company _ has grown into a
$2.8 billion apparel giant over the past 10 years, to the point
that someone buys a product created by the company five times every
second, Liz Claiborne _ the woman _ hasn't really thought about
clothes much more than five times in the entire decade.
 &HT;    She's been more concerned with the fate of elephants in Myanmar,
fish and eagles in Madagascar and European brown bears in the
Carpathian Mountains of Romania, among a roster of other wildlife
conservancy issues, all of which she and her husband and business
mentor, Art Ortenberg, have championed since they willfully
divorced themselves from the apparel industry 11 years ago to
pursue adventures in the West.
 &HT;    It would hardly be fair to call the couple's retirement an
inactive one, yet to most of the industry, having heard hardly a
peep from the designer since she left, the idea of Liz Claiborne as
a person has simply faded into a legend behind what has become one
of fashion's most powerful corporations.
 &HT;    The persona issue is one that Liz Claiborne, the woman, has had
to deal with, as well.
 &HT;    ``Today, it doesn't really mean that much to me,'' she said
recently, breezing into the offices of the Liz Claiborne and Art
Ortenberg Foundation, located 15 stories above the Liz Claiborne
flagship on Fifth Avenue.
 &HT;    ``It's another part of me that isn't at the front of my
awareness these days,'' she said. ``When I'm in Montana and someone
comes up to me and says, 'Aren't you Liz Claiborne?' it takes me a
second to realize what they are asking.''
 &HT;    Claiborne is 71 and looks nearly the same as she did when she
retired. She is tan and wears a black T-shirt and pants, a white
Liz Claiborne jeans jacket and big, red Liz Claiborne glasses, all
of them kept from her days at the helm of the company.
 &HT;    The only thing not Liz Claiborne about her is a white Polo Sport
cap, which she wears to mask the result of chemotherapy treatments
for a rare cancer that affects the lining between the abdomen and
the reproductive organs, with which she was diagnosed three years
ago.
 &HT;    She is near the end of her treatments and doing well, Claiborne
said, and recently accepted the Council of Fashion Designers of
America's Humanitarian Award for the work she and Ortenberg have
done through their foundation.
 &HT;    The foundation devotes a substantial portion of its funds to
Third World countries, supporting more than 50 conservation
programs in the United States, Africa, Asia and Central and South
America.
 &HT;    To a large degree, Claiborne is still fed up with a number of
things about the fashion industry. Always outspoken during her
career, Claiborne often complained about women's roles in the
industry and department-store chargebacks, and during this
interview last week, she made it clear that her view of the
industry has not necessarily improved with age:
 &HT;    
 &HT;     QUESTION:  What have you been up to for the past decade?
 &HT;     LIZ CLAIBORNE:  We happened to have been enjoying the benefits
of having been in the fashion industry, meaning monetarily, and
enjoying our lives. We're very involved in the foundation. We have
ranches in Montana, and then we have a house in St. Barths.
 &HT;    We hadn't planned Montana. We had planned the West. Art had felt
it would be nice to have a place out West, and I couldn't have
agreed more _ I'd always loved horses. Art's assistant at the time
was helping to plan a trip to Canada and she had subscribed to a
magazine called the Hideaway Report. She said, ``On your way to
Canada, why don't you stop off, because it sounds like the kind of
place you'd like.''
 &HT;    And yes, we never got to Canada. We stayed there and we bought a
lodge that took in paying guests. We discovered it was for sale and
we bought it, almost on the spot, after four days. It was perfect
for us. We love Montana because it's different than other areas of
the West, such as Colorado and New Mexico, that are very populated
areas. Montana is tiny.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  Have you maintained any connections to the fashion
industry?
 &HT;     A:  Not at all, except for friends. When we left, we left.
 &HT;    I gather the industry is very different today. It's not as much
fun. It's harder and everything is concentrated. I know I
complained about it then, but I'll complain about it today. The
stores are overstocked. It's hard to find individual looking
things. There's quite a sameness going on, but I guess that always
existed. I'm sure 10 or 15 years ago, I'd be saying the same thing.
 &HT;    But I gather from some of my old friends that it's not as much
fun as it used to be. There was at least some discussion of style
then and what really is important from a fashion point of view for
the department store. Today, I gather, it is all the bottom line.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  How does it feel to be Liz Claiborne today?
 &HT;     A:  Honestly, it feels pretty good. We did achieve a wonderful
company and what we have been able to do with the money we made out
of that company is something Art and I are both very proud of and
will continue to be proud of as it goes further. I'm 71 and I feel
pretty good.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  Do you feel women's roles in fashion have changed?
 &HT;     A:  I feel that hasn't really happened, except for a few
exceptions _ and one really publicized one _ and certainly at the
company, referring to Liz Claiborne, it hasn't really happened.
 &HT;    There is a glass ceiling. All the top echelon of people who
really make the decisions are male, but the second string is a very
open position for women. I still feel the minute it comes to real
heavy business types of decisions encompassing a whole company or a
whole department store, there are very few women who are in
control, except for Linda Wachner, who I was referring to earlier,
who's having her own problems, none of which have to do with being
female.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  How do you feel about that situation? (Calvin Klein sued
Wachner, his biggest licensee, last month, over what he called
trademark violations and breach of fiduciary duty. Wachner
countersued.)
 &HT;     A:  I have to say I'm really on Calvin's side. I can't help but
be on Calvin's side. In this country in particular, you have very
little control over your designer name once you have sold it or
licensed it.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  What do you find in stores today?
 &HT;     A:  I hate to name names, but I gravitate toward a few
designers, though I will shop at stores that are not department
stores.
 &HT;    I'll shop at the Banana Republic because they have some simple
things that I like. I shop at Ralph Lauren a lot these days. He has
a taste level and that all-American look, and I admire him for
being able to change while maintaining that taste level.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  When Liz Claiborne first started opening its own stores,
you said New York would not be an ideal location. Today, the
Claiborne flagship is downstairs.
 &HT;     A:  That was a coincidence. We were in this space before the
store was, and, as a matter of fact, we got a letter from the
gentleman who was the head of retail, apologizing and saying,
``You're not going to be happy about this, but we're moving in.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  One of the greatest successes of Liz Claiborne during your
tenure was the creation of a line of clothing that women could wear
to the office _ career clothes. It's an interesting point where we
are today, when men and women alike are having a difficult time
understanding how to dress themselves casually for careers.
 &HT;     A:  I would think so. There were certain codes then, although
we never had a code. Although the company became known for career
dressing, it was never one of my principals going into business.
 &HT;    Having been a designer all my adult life, I didn't feel you had
to dress in this business suit as a woman and try to be competitive
with men in your dress. I felt you could dress in a much _ not
softer, but less tailored way _ and more colorfully.
 &HT;    We never really were an Evan Picone or a Jones in their navy
blue suits. I never was considered good at that, but I felt women
did want to look put together and should look put together at the
office, so what we tried to do was to pre-digest looks and put them
out so that they were highly understandable and they would put them
together the way they wanted to. They were never sold as units,
they were always sold as separates, but color coordinated, which
was one of the keys, and the way it was displayed was terribly
important, which is why today I say it is more difficult because
everything looks like a bargain basement, no matter what the price.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  When you started your business, did you ever think you
would be a star?
 &HT;     A:  No. It was at an event when I used to travel the country a
lot and do fashion shows and personal appearances. It had gotten to
the point they had scheduled me very tightly _ I had to do a
breakfast show, a luncheon show and fly to another city to do an
evening show. Once the plane was late getting to the other city,
something like an hour and a half, and I thought, ``Well they've
gone ahead with the show,'' and when I landed they greeted me and
said, ``If you can rush there, everybody is still waiting.''
 &HT;    I changed in the hotel room in about two seconds flat and went
out, and when I walked in that room, the applause. I still get
emotional about it, because it was the first time I realized it was
like being a star for a short while.
 &HT;    It was a great feeling, but it was a feeling also of
responsibility when you have women reacting that way and depending
on you. They were very quick also to write me when they didn't like
me. In one year, I got bombarded for a season when they didn't like
their clothes. They didn't buy them and they told me so, so you
realize that you've got to measure up.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  What do you think was the most important contribution you
have made to American fashion over the years?
 &HT;     A:  I think fashion and quality at a price, before it was
readily available. There were the designers, and then there was
what was called better sportswear, which was uptight stuff. There
wasn't much in between.
 &HT;    And responding to that woman out there. She wasn't a kid. She
was somebody who was working, whether she was a teacher or in a
business environment or a nurse, and somehow I had a rapport with
her and understood what she needed.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  You once said your parents were displeased when you told
them that you wanted to be a dress designer.
 &HT;     A:  Rather. My father was very old-fashioned, to the point
where I never went to school, because it wasn't mandatory in Europe
for a girl to go to school, particularly an American citizen.
(Claiborne grew up in Brussels.) He wanted me to be a painter.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  Once the company became successful, did he change his
opinion?
 &HT;     A:  I think he was proud of the success of the company, but he
wouldn't invest in it. He never told me so, but I'm sure he was
proud of me.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  How are you doing with your treatments?
 &HT;     A:  I'm at just about the end of it, but they still want me to
have a few more treatments, and it gets a little bit more difficult
as you get to the end, because your body has had so much, and it
takes a little bit longer to recuperate.
 &HT;    But I feel great and when I first heard I was going to have to
go through chemo, I thought, ``Oh my God, this is terrible,'' but
it's not that bad. It really is not, and I'd like to be able to
tell everybody that. So, you spend a bad day or two or three bad
days a month. Anybody can do that.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  Would you ever design again?
 &HT;     A:  I still love fashion, mind you, and I love clothes. I'll
never get over that, and thank God for the fashion industry, but
no, it's not for me anymore.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  Any other thoughts?
 &HT;     A:  It used to be very exciting to work in the fashion industry
from every point of view, and the business point of view as well,
because if you didn't sell, there was no point in being in
business. I think my biggest kick as a designer was seeing my
clothes walk down the street, and being able to recognize my
clothes on so many people. That was a big thrill.

 COMPILED THE EDITORS AT FAIRCHILD PUBLICATIONS 
 From WWD, W magazine and DNR 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 DONNA'S NEW CAMPAIGN FULFILLS HER DREAM  
 &HT;    ``It's always been a dream of mine to do movies,'' said Donna
Karan, describing the cinematic quality of her fall Collection
campaign.
 &HT;    ``I've always seen my company as a moving experience, as opposed
to a still, from the very first (campaign) shot of a moving car.''
 &HT;    For fall, Karan returns to storytelling in her new ads that
feature actors Milla Jovovich and Gary Oldman, who appeared
together in the film ``The Fifth Element.''
 &HT;    The ads focus on the relationship, emotions and lifestyle of the
couple, unlike recent campaigns that were more product-focused,
said Trey Laird, executive vice-president and corporate creative
director.
 &HT;    ``It's been good that we've done it,'' said Laird of his past
campaigns, ``but sometimes you need to step back and give a healthy
dose of good brand imagery.''
 &HT;    For fall, the company hired Mikael Jansson to photograph, got
the assistance of creative director Fabien Baron and stylist Karl
Templer, hired the actors and headed to France.
 &HT;    ``We set it up like a movie and shot it in Paris. We tried to
capture a relationship between these two characters and what was
going on in their lives,'' Laird said.
 &HT;    ``They make you think, `Do they really get along?''' said Karan.
``Definitely, it's intense. It's like any relationship today. I
wish I had more photographs to show all the aspects of their lives.
The two of them have a chemistry.''
 &HT;    Eight-page inserts will break in the September issues of Vogue,
W and Vanity Fair, and spreads will run in the New York Times
Magazine, Harper's Bazaar, Wallpaper and V. Ads will also appear in
the October issue of Details.
 &HT;    
 SPARKLING DONATION  
 &HT;    Because Elizabeth Taylor was recently proclaimed a Dame of the
British Empire, her fragrance licensee, Elizabeth Arden, is
celebrating by making a donation to her AIDS foundation.
 &HT;    Through August, the company will donate a portion of the
proceeds from sales of Elizabeth Taylor Sparkling White Diamonds.
 &HT;    ``We wanted to honor Dame Elizabeth with a meaningful gift,''
said Susan Taylor, managing director, Elizabeth Arden, U.K. ``We
believe we will be able to donate a substantial sum by the end of
the summer.''
 &HT;    Elizabeth Taylor Sparkling White Diamonds, which launched in the
United States last year, is now available at the 90 branches of
Debenhams throughout the United Kingdom.
 &HT;    
 Golden Greek  
 &HT;    Several biographers have tried in vain to figure out Stavros
Niarchos, the Greek shipping tycoon who died in 1996. But an
upcoming memoir by John Frangoulis, the longtime captain of
Niarchos' yacht, the Creole, should shed more light on the
reclusive billionnaire.
 &HT;    Frangoulis details many of Niarchos' eccentric habits, including
his insistence that his favorite van Goghs be on board the boat
whenever he was _ never mind that they'd be ruined by the sea air.
 &HT;    Then there was Niarchos' habit of swimming nude while an armed
guard stood on deck, checking for sharks.
 &HT;    The book, due out later this year in Europe, also has photos of
the Creole's many illustrious guests _ including the Duchess of
Windsor, who clearly wasn't the type to pack light. For one brief
stay on the boat, she showed up with 12 Vuitton steamer trunks.
 &HT;    
 MANHATTAN TRANSFER  
 &HT;    One of Los Angeles' reigning nightlife impresarios, Sean
MacPherson, is heading to New York.
 &HT;    The man behind such haunts as Smalls, the Olive, Swingers and
Bar Marmont plans to open his first New York restaurant next year
at an unspecified downtown location.
 &HT;    To help him navigate the local terrain, he'll be partnering with
Eric Goode of Bowery Bar fame.
 &HT;    ``I have a good feeling about this one,'' MacPherson says.
 &HT;    
 ROYAL BABES  
 &HT;    Prince William isn't the only pinup in the British royal family.
In the past few months, two of William's female cousins have been
setting male teens' hearts aflutter with their blond looks and
trendy fashion sense.
 &HT;    Gabriella Windsor, the 19-year-old daughter of Prince and
Princess Michael of Kent, had the British tabloids panting when she
appeared at the Badminton Horse Trials in a tight-fitting sweater
and leather Stetson. (Windsor's good looks are shared by her
brother Frederick, a model featured in the latest Burberry
campaign.)
 &HT;    Meanwhile, royal rebel Zara Phillips, 18, delighted the
paparazzi at a recent horse race by wearing a chic jacket and
thigh-high skirt.
 &HT;    Phillips, the daughter of the Princess Royal and Mark Phillips,
is dating jockey Richard Johnson; she has agreed to remove her
tongue stud in exchange for his vow to give up smoking.
 &HT;    
 FIELD DAY  
 &HT;    It's no secret that Hollywood movie stars have been earning
extra cash by appearing in ads on Italian TV: Harrison Ford has
plugged Fiat, Catherine Zeta-Jones has campaigned for Alfa Romeo
and even Brad Pitt has deigned to promote Damiani jewelry, secure
in the knowledge that the commercials would never be shown
Stateside.
 &HT;    But Kevin Costner has reportedly broken a longstanding taboo by
allowing his upcoming shoe commercial to appear in the United
States.
 &HT;    In fact, the new ad, for the mid-range Italian shoe company
Valleverde, will reportedly debut in America this fall and air
later in Europe. The commercial shows Costner walking in a field,
helping a child take its first steps.
 &HT;    
 FETISH SCENT RELAUNCHED  
 &HT;    NEW ORLEANS _ Grammy-award-winning singer Christina Aguilera is
expanding her range with a line of color cosmetics.
 &HT;    The 19-year-old international pop star is partnering with the
Boca Raton, Fla.-based New Dana Perfumes Company on a relaunch of
its teen brand Fetish.
 &HT;    The collection, expected to rollout in January, has been renamed
Fetish by Christina Aguilera. Packaging will carry the slogan
``What a Girl Wants,'' after her hit single.
 &HT;    Aguilera snagged the Grammys' ``Best New Artist'' award earlier
this year and also appeared in the Super Bowl half-time show with
Enrique Iglesias.
 &HT;    Aguilera also has promotional contracts with Levi's and recently
inked a deal with Coca Cola. With Fetish, however, she is directly
involved in product design and packaging.
 &HT;    ``I am definitely going to have a say in the products,''
Aguilera said. She has already swapped the brand's lavender
packaging for black with silver components. ``I've always been a
lover of fashion, and I enjoy playing with makeup.''
 &HT;    This time last year, as part of the Renaissance Cosmetics
Company, Fetish was in Chapter 11. p

 From W magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Giorgio Armani is justly celebrated for his sleek, feminine and
sophisticated style. He got Hollywood hooked on Armani, and many
loyalists, such as Michelle Pfeiffer and Jodie Foster, wear his
clothes around the clock.
 &HT;    So it isn't surprising that, in a season when accessories are in
the forefront of fashion, the designer is relaunching a terrific
collection of handbags, shoes and small leather goods.
 &HT;    ``It's a very exciting time in fashion, and accessories are a
part of that,'' Armani says. ``People are looking for ways to make
a fashion statement, not a loud, in-your-face statement, but one
that suggests their personalities and styles. Accessories are
decorative. They enhance a wardrobe, but they never become the
wardrobe.''
 &HT;    The collection consists of cleanlined pieces, many in vibrant
shades and exotic skins.
 &HT;    ``Color is wonderful,'' the designer says. ``And exotic skins
add texture and patterns, making beautiful accents for my
clothes.''
 &HT;    According to Judith Collinson, executive vice-president of
Barneys New York, ``This line is very cohesive. There is a creative
energy throughout. There's also a retro feeling to some of the
handbag designs, which is new.''
 &HT;    The looks, which Kal Ruttenstein, senior vice-president for
fashion direction at Bloomingdale's, describes as ``strong, sexy,
up-to-date and exciting,'' range from elongated python clutches in
wild colors like fuchsia and orange to bare stiletto lizard sandals
in a pale mint hue.
 &HT;    There are also more ladylike offerings: small structured
top-handle bags in ostrich and alligator or lizard mid-heel pumps,
along with colored beaded handbags and shoes for evening that
perfectly complement the designer's drop-dead eveningwear.

 SOAP STARS  
 &HT;    It has been in business since 1695, so it's pretty safe to say
that French soap and fragrance maker Roger &AMP; Gallet knows a lot
about the art of making soap.
 &HT;    Its newest products, Gardener's Special Soaps, come in such
flavors as Cherry Tomato, Lettuce and Carrot; they contain actual
vegetable extracts and smell good enough to bathe in. Available at
Henri Bendel, Nordstrom, Bloomingdale's and Marshall Fields.
 &HT;    
 MRS. FROSTY  
 &HT;    In the thick of summer, just the idea of wearing makeup can make
anyone break into a sweat. To the rescue: Aveda's new Cooling
Calming Cover Sheer Face Tint (a foundation) and Aveda Cooling
Calming Color Eye/Cheek Tint (a blush).
 &HT;    They not only keep you polished but also promise to lower body
temperature by five degrees _ thanks to formulas that contain
almost 50 percent water. And when the heat's on, this is definitely
a good thing. Aveda, (800) 283-3224.
 &HT;    
 WILD CARD  
 &HT;    With her first foray into makeup, Iman _ the Somalian
supermodel, mother-to-be and wife of David Bowie _ proved that she
knew how to do basic, wearable makeup. Now, with her creation of
I-Iman Makeup, she's showing the world her uninhibited side.
 &HT;    For this collection, Iman has unleashed a few tricks of her
trade, such as I-Matte, a gel spray that instantly seals makeup,
and I-Shimmer, an iridescent powder with glorious shine in a
rainbow of shades. Exclusively at Sephora.
 &HT;    
 CRYSTAL LIGHT  
 &HT;    When mineral makeup was first introduced a few years ago, it was
dismissed as a quirky trend.
 &HT;    Francie Willis, the owner of the Urban Retreat Day Spa in
Houston, is setting out to change that with Franche, her extensive
collection of water-resistant mineral makeup with freeze-dried
vitamins.
 &HT;    Particularly appealing is Lip Luscious, an iridescent gloss made
from plant-derived liquid crystals. Available at Henri Bendel and
at (877) 372-4243. c.2000 Fairchild Publications

 By ERIC WILSON 
 From W magazine) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ While Liz Claiborne _ the company _ has grown into a
$2.8 billion apparel giant over the past 10 years, to the point
that someone buys a product created by the company five times every
second, Liz Claiborne _ the woman _ hasn't really thought about
clothes much more than five times in the entire decade.
 &HT;    She's been more concerned with the fate of elephants in Myanmar,
fish and eagles in Madagascar and European brown bears in the
Carpathian Mountains of Romania, among a roster of other wildlife
conservancy issues, all of which she and her husband and business
mentor, Art Ortenberg, have championed since they willfully
divorced themselves from the apparel industry 11 years ago to
pursue adventures in the West.
 &HT;    It would hardly be fair to call the couple's retirement an
inactive one, yet to most of the industry, having heard hardly a
peep from the designer since she left, the idea of Liz Claiborne as
a person has simply faded into a legend behind what has become one
of fashion's most powerful corporations.
 &HT;    The persona issue is one that Liz Claiborne, the woman, has had
to deal with, as well.
 &HT;    ``Today, it doesn't really mean that much to me,'' she said
recently, breezing into the offices of the Liz Claiborne and Art
Ortenberg Foundation, located 15 stories above the Liz Claiborne
flagship on Fifth Avenue.
 &HT;    ``It's another part of me that isn't at the front of my
awareness these days,'' she said. ``When I'm in Montana and someone
comes up to me and says, 'Aren't you Liz Claiborne?' it takes me a
second to realize what they are asking.''
 &HT;    Claiborne is 71 and looks nearly the same as she did when she
retired. She is tan and wears a black T-shirt and pants, a white
Liz Claiborne jeans jacket and big, red Liz Claiborne glasses, all
of them kept from her days at the helm of the company.
 &HT;    The only thing not Liz Claiborne about her is a white Polo Sport
cap, which she wears to mask the result of chemotherapy treatments
for a rare cancer that affects the lining between the abdomen and
the reproductive organs, with which she was diagnosed three years
ago.
 &HT;    She is near the end of her treatments and doing well, Claiborne
said, and recently accepted the Council of Fashion Designers of
America's Humanitarian Award for the work she and Ortenberg have
done through their foundation.
 &HT;    The foundation devotes a substantial portion of its funds to
Third World countries, supporting more than 50 conservation
programs in the United States, Africa, Asia and Central and South
America.
 &HT;    To a large degree, Claiborne is still fed up with a number of
things about the fashion industry. Always outspoken during her
career, Claiborne often complained about women's roles in the
industry and department-store chargebacks, and during this
interview last week, she made it clear that her view of the
industry has not necessarily improved with age:
 &HT;    
 &HT;     QUESTION:  What have you been up to for the past decade?
 &HT;     LIZ CLAIBORNE:  We happened to have been enjoying the benefits
of having been in the fashion industry, meaning monetarily, and
enjoying our lives. We're very involved in the foundation. We have
ranches in Montana, and then we have a house in St. Barths.
 &HT;    We hadn't planned Montana. We had planned the West. Art had felt
it would be nice to have a place out West, and I couldn't have
agreed more _ I'd always loved horses. Art's assistant at the time
was helping to plan a trip to Canada and she had subscribed to a
magazine called the Hideaway Report. She said, ``On your way to
Canada, why don't you stop off, because it sounds like the kind of
place you'd like.''
 &HT;    And yes, we never got to Canada. We stayed there and we bought a
lodge that took in paying guests. We discovered it was for sale and
we bought it, almost on the spot, after four days. It was perfect
for us. We love Montana because it's different than other areas of
the West, such as Colorado and New Mexico, that are very populated
areas. Montana is tiny.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  Have you maintained any connections to the fashion
industry?
 &HT;     A:  Not at all, except for friends. When we left, we left.
 &HT;    I gather the industry is very different today. It's not as much
fun. It's harder and everything is concentrated. I know I
complained about it then, but I'll complain about it today. The
stores are overstocked. It's hard to find individual looking
things. There's quite a sameness going on, but I guess that always
existed. I'm sure 10 or 15 years ago, I'd be saying the same thing.
 &HT;    But I gather from some of my old friends that it's not as much
fun as it used to be. There was at least some discussion of style
then and what really is important from a fashion point of view for
the department store. Today, I gather, it is all the bottom line.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  How does it feel to be Liz Claiborne today?
 &HT;     A:  Honestly, it feels pretty good. We did achieve a wonderful
company and what we have been able to do with the money we made out
of that company is something Art and I are both very proud of and
will continue to be proud of as it goes further. I'm 71 and I feel
pretty good.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  Do you feel women's roles in fashion have changed?
 &HT;     A:  I feel that hasn't really happened, except for a few
exceptions _ and one really publicized one _ and certainly at the
company, referring to Liz Claiborne, it hasn't really happened.
 &HT;    There is a glass ceiling. All the top echelon of people who
really make the decisions are male, but the second string is a very
open position for women. I still feel the minute it comes to real
heavy business types of decisions encompassing a whole company or a
whole department store, there are very few women who are in
control, except for Linda Wachner, who I was referring to earlier,
who's having her own problems, none of which have to do with being
female.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  How do you feel about that situation? (Calvin Klein sued
Wachner, his biggest licensee, last month, over what he called
trademark violations and breach of fiduciary duty. Wachner
countersued.)
 &HT;     A:  I have to say I'm really on Calvin's side. I can't help but
be on Calvin's side. In this country in particular, you have very
little control over your designer name once you have sold it or
licensed it.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  What do you find in stores today?
 &HT;     A:  I hate to name names, but I gravitate toward a few
designers, though I will shop at stores that are not department
stores.
 &HT;    I'll shop at the Banana Republic because they have some simple
things that I like. I shop at Ralph Lauren a lot these days. He has
a taste level and that all-American look, and I admire him for
being able to change while maintaining that taste level.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  When Liz Claiborne first started opening its own stores,
you said New York would not be an ideal location. Today, the
Claiborne flagship is downstairs.
 &HT;     A:  That was a coincidence. We were in this space before the
store was, and, as a matter of fact, we got a letter from the
gentleman who was the head of retail, apologizing and saying,
``You're not going to be happy about this, but we're moving in.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  One of the greatest successes of Liz Claiborne during your
tenure was the creation of a line of clothing that women could wear
to the office _ career clothes. It's an interesting point where we
are today, when men and women alike are having a difficult time
understanding how to dress themselves casually for careers.
 &HT;     A:  I would think so. There were certain codes then, although
we never had a code. Although the company became known for career
dressing, it was never one of my principals going into business.
 &HT;    Having been a designer all my adult life, I didn't feel you had
to dress in this business suit as a woman and try to be competitive
with men in your dress. I felt you could dress in a much _ not
softer, but less tailored way _ and more colorfully.
 &HT;    We never really were an Evan Picone or a Jones in their navy
blue suits. I never was considered good at that, but I felt women
did want to look put together and should look put together at the
office, so what we tried to do was to pre-digest looks and put them
out so that they were highly understandable and they would put them
together the way they wanted to. They were never sold as units,
they were always sold as separates, but color coordinated, which
was one of the keys, and the way it was displayed was terribly
important, which is why today I say it is more difficult because
everything looks like a bargain basement, no matter what the price.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  When you started your business, did you ever think you
would be a star?
 &HT;     A:  No. It was at an event when I used to travel the country a
lot and do fashion shows and personal appearances. It had gotten to
the point they had scheduled me very tightly _ I had to do a
breakfast show, a luncheon show and fly to another city to do an
evening show. Once the plane was late getting to the other city,
something like an hour and a half, and I thought, ``Well they've
gone ahead with the show,'' and when I landed they greeted me and
said, ``If you can rush there, everybody is still waiting.''
 &HT;    I changed in the hotel room in about two seconds flat and went
out, and when I walked in that room, the applause. I still get
emotional about it, because it was the first time I realized it was
like being a star for a short while.
 &HT;    It was a great feeling, but it was a feeling also of
responsibility when you have women reacting that way and depending
on you. They were very quick also to write me when they didn't like
me. In one year, I got bombarded for a season when they didn't like
their clothes. They didn't buy them and they told me so, so you
realize that you've got to measure up.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  What do you think was the most important contribution you
have made to American fashion over the years?
 &HT;     A:  I think fashion and quality at a price, before it was
readily available. There were the designers, and then there was
what was called better sportswear, which was uptight stuff. There
wasn't much in between.
 &HT;    And responding to that woman out there. She wasn't a kid. She
was somebody who was working, whether she was a teacher or in a
business environment or a nurse, and somehow I had a rapport with
her and understood what she needed.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  You once said your parents were displeased when you told
them that you wanted to be a dress designer.
 &HT;     A:  Rather. My father was very old-fashioned, to the point
where I never went to school, because it wasn't mandatory in Europe
for a girl to go to school, particularly an American citizen.
(Claiborne grew up in Brussels.) He wanted me to be a painter.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  Once the company became successful, did he change his
opinion?
 &HT;     A:  I think he was proud of the success of the company, but he
wouldn't invest in it. He never told me so, but I'm sure he was
proud of me.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  How are you doing with your treatments?
 &HT;     A:  I'm at just about the end of it, but they still want me to
have a few more treatments, and it gets a little bit more difficult
as you get to the end, because your body has had so much, and it
takes a little bit longer to recuperate.
 &HT;    But I feel great and when I first heard I was going to have to
go through chemo, I thought, ``Oh my God, this is terrible,'' but
it's not that bad. It really is not, and I'd like to be able to
tell everybody that. So, you spend a bad day or two or three bad
days a month. Anybody can do that.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  Would you ever design again?
 &HT;     A:  I still love fashion, mind you, and I love clothes. I'll
never get over that, and thank God for the fashion industry, but
no, it's not for me anymore.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  Any other thoughts?
 &HT;     A:  It used to be very exciting to work in the fashion industry
from every point of view, and the business point of view as well,
because if you didn't sell, there was no point in being in
business. I think my biggest kick as a designer was seeing my
clothes walk down the street, and being able to recognize my
clothes on so many people. That was a big thrill.

 COMPILED THE EDITORS AT FAIRCHILD PUBLICATIONS 
 From WWD, W magazine and DNR 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 DONNA'S NEW CAMPAIGN FULFILLS HER DREAM  
 &HT;    ``It's always been a dream of mine to do movies,'' said Donna
Karan, describing the cinematic quality of her fall Collection
campaign.
 &HT;    ``I've always seen my company as a moving experience, as opposed
to a still, from the very first (campaign) shot of a moving car.''
 &HT;    For fall, Karan returns to storytelling in her new ads that
feature actors Milla Jovovich and Gary Oldman, who appeared
together in the film ``The Fifth Element.''
 &HT;    The ads focus on the relationship, emotions and lifestyle of the
couple, unlike recent campaigns that were more product-focused,
said Trey Laird, executive vice-president and corporate creative
director.
 &HT;    ``It's been good that we've done it,'' said Laird of his past
campaigns, ``but sometimes you need to step back and give a healthy
dose of good brand imagery.''
 &HT;    For fall, the company hired Mikael Jansson to photograph, got
the assistance of creative director Fabien Baron and stylist Karl
Templer, hired the actors and headed to France.
 &HT;    ``We set it up like a movie and shot it in Paris. We tried to
capture a relationship between these two characters and what was
going on in their lives,'' Laird said.
 &HT;    ``They make you think, `Do they really get along?''' said Karan.
``Definitely, it's intense. It's like any relationship today. I
wish I had more photographs to show all the aspects of their lives.
The two of them have a chemistry.''
 &HT;    Eight-page inserts will break in the September issues of Vogue,
W and Vanity Fair, and spreads will run in the New York Times
Magazine, Harper's Bazaar, Wallpaper and V. Ads will also appear in
the October issue of Details.
 &HT;    
 SPARKLING DONATION  
 &HT;    Because Elizabeth Taylor was recently proclaimed a Dame of the
British Empire, her fragrance licensee, Elizabeth Arden, is
celebrating by making a donation to her AIDS foundation.
 &HT;    Through August, the company will donate a portion of the
proceeds from sales of Elizabeth Taylor Sparkling White Diamonds.
 &HT;    ``We wanted to honor Dame Elizabeth with a meaningful gift,''
said Susan Taylor, managing director, Elizabeth Arden, U.K. ``We
believe we will be able to donate a substantial sum by the end of
the summer.''
 &HT;    Elizabeth Taylor Sparkling White Diamonds, which launched in the
United States last year, is now available at the 90 branches of
Debenhams throughout the United Kingdom.
 &HT;    
 Golden Greek  
 &HT;    Several biographers have tried in vain to figure out Stavros
Niarchos, the Greek shipping tycoon who died in 1996. But an
upcoming memoir by John Frangoulis, the longtime captain of
Niarchos' yacht, the Creole, should shed more light on the
reclusive billionnaire.
 &HT;    Frangoulis details many of Niarchos' eccentric habits, including
his insistence that his favorite van Goghs be on board the boat
whenever he was _ never mind that they'd be ruined by the sea air.
 &HT;    Then there was Niarchos' habit of swimming nude while an armed
guard stood on deck, checking for sharks.
 &HT;    The book, due out later this year in Europe, also has photos of
the Creole's many illustrious guests _ including the Duchess of
Windsor, who clearly wasn't the type to pack light. For one brief
stay on the boat, she showed up with 12 Vuitton steamer trunks.
 &HT;    
 MANHATTAN TRANSFER  
 &HT;    One of Los Angeles' reigning nightlife impresarios, Sean
MacPherson, is heading to New York.
 &HT;    The man behind such haunts as Smalls, the Olive, Swingers and
Bar Marmont plans to open his first New York restaurant next year
at an unspecified downtown location.
 &HT;    To help him navigate the local terrain, he'll be partnering with
Eric Goode of Bowery Bar fame.
 &HT;    ``I have a good feeling about this one,'' MacPherson says.
 &HT;    
 ROYAL BABES  
 &HT;    Prince William isn't the only pinup in the British royal family.
In the past few months, two of William's female cousins have been
setting male teens' hearts aflutter with their blond looks and
trendy fashion sense.
 &HT;    Gabriella Windsor, the 19-year-old daughter of Prince and
Princess Michael of Kent, had the British tabloids panting when she
appeared at the Badminton Horse Trials in a tight-fitting sweater
and leather Stetson. (Windsor's good looks are shared by her
brother Frederick, a model featured in the latest Burberry
campaign.)
 &HT;    Meanwhile, royal rebel Zara Phillips, 18, delighted the
paparazzi at a recent horse race by wearing a chic jacket and
thigh-high skirt.
 &HT;    Phillips, the daughter of the Princess Royal and Mark Phillips,
is dating jockey Richard Johnson; she has agreed to remove her
tongue stud in exchange for his vow to give up smoking.
 &HT;    
 FIELD DAY  
 &HT;    It's no secret that Hollywood movie stars have been earning
extra cash by appearing in ads on Italian TV: Harrison Ford has
plugged Fiat, Catherine Zeta-Jones has campaigned for Alfa Romeo
and even Brad Pitt has deigned to promote Damiani jewelry, secure
in the knowledge that the commercials would never be shown
Stateside.
 &HT;    But Kevin Costner has reportedly broken a longstanding taboo by
allowing his upcoming shoe commercial to appear in the United
States.
 &HT;    In fact, the new ad, for the mid-range Italian shoe company
Valleverde, will reportedly debut in America this fall and air
later in Europe. The commercial shows Costner walking in a field,
helping a child take its first steps.
 &HT;    
 FETISH SCENT RELAUNCHED  
 &HT;    NEW ORLEANS _ Grammy-award-winning singer Christina Aguilera is
expanding her range with a line of color cosmetics.
 &HT;    The 19-year-old international pop star is partnering with the
Boca Raton, Fla.-based New Dana Perfumes Company on a relaunch of
its teen brand Fetish.
 &HT;    The collection, expected to rollout in January, has been renamed
Fetish by Christina Aguilera. Packaging will carry the slogan
``What a Girl Wants,'' after her hit single.
 &HT;    Aguilera snagged the Grammys' ``Best New Artist'' award earlier
this year and also appeared in the Super Bowl half-time show with
Enrique Iglesias.
 &HT;    Aguilera also has promotional contracts with Levi's and recently
inked a deal with Coca Cola. With Fetish, however, she is directly
involved in product design and packaging.
 &HT;    ``I am definitely going to have a say in the products,''
Aguilera said. She has already swapped the brand's lavender
packaging for black with silver components. ``I've always been a
lover of fashion, and I enjoy playing with makeup.''
 &HT;    This time last year, as part of the Renaissance Cosmetics
Company, Fetish was in Chapter 11. p

 (Three color slides) 
 From W magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Giorgio Armani is justly celebrated for his sleek, feminine and
sophisticated style. He got Hollywood hooked on Armani, and many
loyalists, such as Michelle Pfeiffer and Jodie Foster, wear his
clothes around the clock.
 &HT;    So it isn't surprising that, in a season when accessories are in
the forefront of fashion, the designer is relaunching a terrific
collection of handbags, shoes and small leather goods.
 &HT;    ``It's a very exciting time in fashion, and accessories are a
part of that,'' Armani says. ``People are looking for ways to make
a fashion statement, not a loud, in-your-face statement, but one
that suggests their personalities and styles. Accessories are
decorative. They enhance a wardrobe, but they never become the
wardrobe.''
 &HT;    The collection consists of cleanlined pieces, many in vibrant
shades and exotic skins.
 &HT;    ``Color is wonderful,'' the designer says. ``And exotic skins
add texture and patterns, making beautiful accents for my
clothes.''
 &HT;    According to Judith Collinson, executive vice-president of
Barneys New York, ``This line is very cohesive. There is a creative
energy throughout. There's also a retro feeling to some of the
handbag designs, which is new.''
 &HT;    The looks, which Kal Ruttenstein, senior vice-president for
fashion direction at Bloomingdale's, describes as ``strong, sexy,
up-to-date and exciting,'' range from elongated python clutches in
wild colors like fuchsia and orange to bare stiletto lizard sandals
in a pale mint hue.
 &HT;    There are also more ladylike offerings: small structured
top-handle bags in ostrich and alligator or lizard mid-heel pumps,
along with colored beaded handbags and shoes for evening that
perfectly complement the designer's drop-dead eveningwear.

 SOAP STARS  
 &HT;    It has been in business since 1695, so it's pretty safe to say
that French soap and fragrance maker Roger &AMP; Gallet knows a lot
about the art of making soap.
 &HT;    Its newest products, Gardener's Special Soaps, come in such
flavors as Cherry Tomato, Lettuce and Carrot; they contain actual
vegetable extracts and smell good enough to bathe in. Available at
Henri Bendel, Nordstrom, Bloomingdale's and Marshall Fields.
 &HT;    
 MRS. FROSTY  
 &HT;    In the thick of summer, just the idea of wearing makeup can make
anyone break into a sweat. To the rescue: Aveda's new Cooling
Calming Cover Sheer Face Tint (a foundation) and Aveda Cooling
Calming Color Eye/Cheek Tint (a blush).
 &HT;    They not only keep you polished but also promise to lower body
temperature by five degrees _ thanks to formulas that contain
almost 50 percent water. And when the heat's on, this is definitely
a good thing. Aveda, (800) 283-3224.
 &HT;    
 WILD CARD  
 &HT;    With her first foray into makeup, Iman _ the Somalian
supermodel, mother-to-be and wife of David Bowie _ proved that she
knew how to do basic, wearable makeup. Now, with her creation of
I-Iman Makeup, she's showing the world her uninhibited side.
 &HT;    For this collection, Iman has unleashed a few tricks of her
trade, such as I-Matte, a gel spray that instantly seals makeup,
and I-Shimmer, an iridescent powder with glorious shine in a
rainbow of shades. Exclusively at Sephora.
 &HT;    
 CRYSTAL LIGHT  
 &HT;    When mineral makeup was first introduced a few years ago, it was
dismissed as a quirky trend.
 &HT;    Francie Willis, the owner of the Urban Retreat Day Spa in
Houston, is setting out to change that with Franche, her extensive
collection of water-resistant mineral makeup with freeze-dried
vitamins.
 &HT;    Particularly appealing is Lip Luscious, an iridescent gloss made
from plant-derived liquid crystals. Available at Henri Bendel and
at (877) 372-4243. c.2000 Fairchild Publications

 &HT;    WEB MAKES BIG-TIME DEBUT AT POLITICAL CONVENTIONS
 &HT;    780&AMP;add. Moving in the (w) Washington and (p) politics
categories for release Sunday, July 16.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1948, the television networks broke new ground
by broadcasting the national political conventions from
Philadelphia. People in five East Coast cities were able to watch
the live proceedings via a cable hookup at a time when there were
fewer than 400,000 TV set owners in the whole country.
</P>
<P>
   This year, as the once huge influence of the TV networks on
political coverage wanes, the upcoming Republican and Democratic
national conventions are emerging as a battleground for the
increasingly robust political Internet culture.
</P>
<P>
   Around each meeting hall, pool cameras operated by C-SPAN will
beam images that can readily be accessed on tens of millions of
computers in every corner of the planet already linked to the
Internet. While most onlookers will lack a TV-quality picture, they
will be free to choose their own camera angles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big difference between now and four years ago is video,''
said Chris Long, director of new media for C-SPAN, which will offer
pooled convention coverage for both the networks and Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers in both convention cities have set aside ``Internet
Alleys'' for about 40 online news organizations, including such
political Web sites as Voter.com, America Online Inc.,
Pseudopolitics.com and Slate, a political journal owned by
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these video-equipped sites will also offer tailored
coverage of what onetime Watergate author Carl Bernstein, now
executive editor of Voter.com, calls ``the shadow convention _ all
the stuff that goes on whenever tens of thousands of political
activists, lobbyists and journalists get together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our approach will be to stay off the podium to give people the
sound and the feel of what's going on behind the scenes,''
Bernstein said. ``In looking at our potential audience, it will be,
above all else, the 40,000 people who have come to Philadelphia or
Los Angeles as players so they can see what everybody else is up
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Voter.com, a for-profit outlet that also aggregates
coverage from other political sites, will issue ``smart cards'' to
delegates and their associates. The cards can be used to gain
access to Web consoles that will tell them where late evening
parties are taking place _ with links to online maps that show them
how to get there.
</P>
<P>
   The Web has even edged its way into those once haughty symbols
of convention coverage: roof-hugging skyboxes. This year, for the
first time, the five veteran networks and their four all-news
commercial cable rivals have new dot-com neighbors ensconced in
customized booths high above the convention floors. Voter.com,
Pseudopolitics.com, AOL and USAToday.com, among others, have
booths.
</P>
<P>
   While the major networks have steadily cut back on their
coverage, the conventions will still each attract upwards of 15,000
traditional media personnel from some 1,500 news outlets. They
include 440 newspapers, 330 television stations, 220 radio stations
and 190 magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the major Internet outlets that have joined them in
depth on the 2000 political scene will seek to create a ``brand''
presence for future years, much as the networks once jockeyed at
these quadrennial affairs to forge a dominant position among
viewers for their overall news programming.
</P>
<P>
   Fledgling broadcast Internet sites will share facilities with
their venerable network relatives. In many cases, they will be
double-teaming coverage, offering viewers their choice of watching
either TV sets or computer monitors.

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ The decision by the Colorado board of education
to enourage schools to place the motto ``In God We Trust'' could
result in a new Supreme Court challenge that could even affect the
use of the phrase on currency. And, to what civic purpose, asks Tom
Teepen. (Teepen, Cox News Service.)

<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ If you believe that either presidential
candidate, Al Gore or George W. Bush, has a medical prescription
plan that has any chance of traveling, even slightly as proposed,
through the labyrinth of the lobbyist-dominated Congress, then I
have a bridge in Brooklyn I want to sell you -- again. It makes for
great listening from the stump and, I suppose, it does position
each candidate on the issue. But, don't expect the winner to
deliver; he won't, he can't. The system won't allow it. (Kleinberg,
Cox News Service.)

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Although my presidential
campaign lurched to a slow start, I'm happy to report things are

promised _ five from readers who agree with my suggestions for
campaign finance reform ($50 per candidate and no disclosure), two
from my friends Gail (Oregon Gail and Cape Cod Gail), and one each
from my son and his wife because they live in Philadelphia and
would like to weekend in the White House. (Schuett, Cox News

ENVYING THE HAIRY WISDOM OF COCKROACHES
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID GRIMES   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   One of the things this column has
going for it, other than its superior absorbency, is its unwavering
commitment to bringing you, the squeamish reader, the latest news
on cockroaches.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In previous columns, I have suggested making the cockroach the
official Florida state bird and I have even passed along a
moneymaking scheme by which we can sell our abundant native
cockroaches to the Japanese for $70,000 a pop.
</P>
<P>
   I expect no praise or reward for this, just as I expect no
praise or reward for a column I wrote suggesting that people can
improve their mood by plunging their noses into the armpits of
elderly women.
</P>
<P>
   The latest cockroach news, reported by Reuters, is that
cockroaches can sense danger by the way wind ruffles tiny hairs on
their back legs.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, this may not seem like important information.
How many of us, after all, really have the time or inclination to
chase after cockroaches with little battery-powered fans when a can
of Raid is just as effective and requires no running?
</P>
<P>
   The question is, how do cockroaches can tell the difference
between a good wind and a bad wind? A good wind, to a cockroach,
might be what comes from a crumb of Oreo just before it hits the
floor. A bad wind would be the breeze created by the heel of a
penny-loafer just before it sends the cockroach to that great Pest
Motel in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   That cockroaches are able to distinguish the difference is just
another example of how much smarter insects are than us. At this
very moment, the breeze from the air-conditioning vent is ruffling
the hairs on the back of my legs and I have no idea whether someone
is going to hand me a million dollars or smack me upside the head
with a baseball bat. All I know for certain is that my electric
bill is going to be high.
</P>
<P>
   Ultra-sensitive hairs on the back of our legs would certainly
save us from doing a lot of dumb things. Sitting through
back-to-back episodes of Greed: The Series is something that
springs immediately to mind. When the hairs on the back of your
legs stiffen like the quills on a porcupine, then you know the
Jerry Springer show is coming up next or, possibly, WWF Smackdown!,
though there are those who argue that the two shows are actually
the same.
</P>
<P>
   People would not buy cars like the Yugo or the Chevy Vega if
their leg hairs were as sensitive as a cockroach's. People wouldn't
wear copper bracelets or put magnets in their shoes, and the whole
body-piercing phenomenon would never have happened.
</P>
<P>
   With better-tuned leg hairs, no one would pay a restaurant $40
for a bottle of wine that can be purchased at the grocery store for
one quarter the price.
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon and Beanie Babies and $5-a-pack baseball cards would sit
on store shelves, collecting dust.
</P>
<P>
   The person who thought of hooking up cars to the Internet would
not be hailed as an innovator but would instead be fired for gross
stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   Builders who call $200,000 homes ``affordable housing'' would go
bankrupt overnight.
</P>
<P>
   People who see Christ's face in the stain on a side of a
building would be unable to pull on their pants due to their spiky
leg hairs.
</P>
<P>
   Even his most devoted fans would finally come to terms with the
fact that Elvis is really dead.
</P>
<P>
   One can only hope that advances in modern cockroach science will
continue and someday researchers will figure out a way to make
people's leg hairs as sensitive as a bug's.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, you could try gluing a couple of cockroaches to
your calves and see if that makes you any smarter.
</P>
<P>
   If you feel a breeze, don't be alarmed. It's probably just
somebody spritzing you with Raid.

 &HT;    How to detect brittle bones
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scans can predict, detect problems
</P>
<P>
   Just 10 years ago, detection and treatment of osteoporosis
wasn't done, because technology and drugs to deter the disorder
didn't exist. Today, doctors can see, treat, predict and prevent
the disease that is putting 28 million Americans at risk for
fractures and potential life-threatening complications.
Osteoporosis costs $38 million a day for hospital and nursing home
care. The first step to prevention or treatment is a bone scan.
</P>
<P>
   WHO SHOULD
</P>
<P>
   BE TESTED?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Every woman entering menopause; women lose up to one-third of
their bone mass when estrogen declines.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Younger women who have several risk factors, such as
undergoing a hysterectomy with ovaries removed, family history of
osteoporosis, past or current smoking, small body frame, past
broken bone, or suffering anorexia at some point in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Older men who have suffered fractures, suffer from arthritis,
have a family history of osteoporosis, suffer low testosterone, or
have taken medication that reduces bone strength, such as cortisone
or anticonvulsants.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tests should be repeated every couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT CAN A TEST DO?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Detect low bone density.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Predict chances of a fracture.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Confirm a diagnosis of osteoporosis if a fracture already has
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Determine rate of bone loss if tests are conducted every few
years.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Monitor the effects of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT TYPE OF TESTING?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Central machines measure bone mass in the hip, spine and total
body and are the most accurate; scans cost $200 to $300. These
tests, known as DXA or DEXA, are recommended for people who've
already experienced a fracture, for women under 50 who've undergone
surgical removal of the ovaries, or for women who are entering
menopause and have other risk factors. The test is also used to see
if bone density has improved with treatment.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Peripheral machines measure finger, wrist, heel or shin and
sometimes are used as a screening tool to determine whether more
expensive testing is needed; scans cost $50 to $100. They are
typically performed on men and women 65 or older who do not have
any osteoporosis risk factors. The machine is portable.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT HAPPENS
</P>
<P>
   IN SCREENING?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Central scans: Patients lie face up on the table of the
machine fully clothed. A specialist operates the machine using a
computer and an armlike device that glides over the body, using a
low-dose X-ray. The largest weight-bearing bones in the body _
femur (thigh), pelvis and bottom five spinal vertebrae _ are
scanned. The scan takes 15 minutes. A computer program instantly
assesses the mass of the bones, then compares it to healthy
patients of the same age and ethnic group. A comparison is also
made to a healthy younger person. After the scan, a radiologist
interprets the findings, and patients typically find out results
from their doctor.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Peripheral scans: A heel scan is most common. The patient sits
and removes sock or stocking from the nondominant foot; it is
positioned in the machine with an ankle brace. Gel is put on both
sides of the heel, where two soft rubber pads are placed.
Ultrasound waves move through the heel and measure bone density.
Results instantly appear on a computerized window and are recorded
by the technician.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT DO
</P>
<P>
   DOCTORS RECOMMEND?
</P>
<P>
   Depending on scan results, a patient may be told to:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Eat a diet rich in calcium and vitamin D, or take calcium and
vitamin D supplements. Calcium intake should be 1,000 to 1,200
milligrams per day.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Engage in weight-bearing exercise, such as walking or lifting
weights, which helps build bones.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Quit smoking; limit alcohol intake.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Take drugs to treat or prevent osteoporosis.

   NO-WHINE-NEWHOUSE _ Riding the new century's technological
innovation and economic expansion is an ethic of individual
initiative and accountability, expressed with the hipness and
attitude of youth. And in a land where Jerry Springer is a minor
deity and the culture of complaint, alibi and blame so strong that
a conservative commentator once dubbed us a Nation of Victims, such
personal responsibility is bracingly refreshing. Photos. About
1,900 words.

<P>
   SHARK-CANCERCURE-NEWHOUSE _ Andrew J. Lane finds himself in the
crossfire of separate federal regulations. He markets shark
cartilage tablets as a dietary supplement under the natural dietary
supplement law that allows nontraditional products to be sold over
the counter without federal approval. But his claim that the
supplement is a cure for cancer places his product in conflict with
the law governing pharmaceuticals that requires rigorous scientific
data and Food and Drug Administration certification. About 1,000
words.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Embracing the state of Mississippi is like rooting for the
Cleveland Indians or championing eight-track tapes: You'll never be
accused of being a fair-weather fan or jumping on the bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   Often noted for high unemployment and poverty and low
educational achievement, the Magnolia State has an image problem
that often overshadows one of its most prominent and enduring
exports: the American music created in the North Mississippi hills.
</P>
<P>
   In another couple of decades, the acoustic blues of R.L.
Burnside, Mississippi Fred McDowell, Junior Kimbrough and Othar
Turner could be lost forever. But brothers Luther and Cody
Dickinson of the band North Mississippi Allstars have taken it upon
themselves not to let that happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delta blues, urban blues and early Chicago stuff? Those were
eras ago,'' Luther said by phone from a tour stop. ``The
(Mississippi) hill country is a contemporary phenomenon. Othar is
still throwing picnics, and Burnside is still cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Luther, 27, and Cody, 24, the old-timers may have a
legacy they never imagined. With their first album, Shake Hands
With Shorty, the North Mississippi Allstars have electrified and
modernized the music of their in-state influences. The project has
fused several generations of artists into a musical style that
should be hailed as the counterpart to southern Mississippi Delta
blues.
</P>
<P>
   The album features technological makeovers of songs by McDowell
and Burnside invigorated with looping to help bring the music to a
younger audience. Preservation of the tin-roof beats and hardwood
stomps that created the songs was essential. Still, purists might
say it's a bastardized form of the original art. The original
artists, however, appear to approve and have taken the Dickinson
boys under their wings.
</P>
<P>
   The band has been touring for several years, but its current
U.S. tour may be its first significant cultural exchange with the
rest of America. There is not much room on rock radio for a couple
of white kids updating a black musical tradition. But since Shake
Hands With Shorty was released in May, the North Mississippi
Allstars have been hailed by critics from publications as diverse
as Rolling Stone and the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the accolades spring from the Allstars' interpretive
abilities.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the brothers' excavation of _ and reverence for _ the
music and musicians that warm others. In taking on the music of the
hills, the band has created a unique blend of Los Angeles
techno-sheen, college folk noodling and retro muddy blues licks.
The Allstars have become the next generation of storytellers and
lobbyists for a way of life fast being forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mississippi is God's country,'' Luther Dickinson said, adding
that he's never felt out of place as a white kid playing from a
predominantly black musical tradition. ``It's very harmonious, and
the music brings us together. People who have never lived an
integrated lifestyle shouldn't talk. I'll defend it to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Fayette County, Tenn., guitarist and vocalist Luther and
drummer Cody grew up listening to Van Halen and Black Flag and
formed punk bands with such names as Pigs in Space and DDT.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point in Luther's musical education occurred after
the family moved to Mississippi when he was a teen. Luther soon met
and played informally with Othar Turner, a 92-year-old
fife-and-drum man.
</P>
<P>
   They started by listening to recordings of Turner stamping out
acoustic Mississippi blues in the 1920s and '30s. The old musician
hypnotized Luther with stories about the music's roots.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Luther started accompanying Turner on guitar. As
Mississippi and Delta blues are often performed in a solo format,
it was a great honor to be asked to sit in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Othar is a first-generation bluesman. He's a farmer, a
connoisseur of bootleg whiskey and a womanizer. He's a link to the
past,'' said Luther, who now sits in on jam sessions with the old
master at his home. ``He's got this real rhythmic groove a
trancelike rolling groove.''
</P>
<P>
   Through Turner, the Dickinsons learned of McDowell, whose many
songs include You've Got to Move, later refurbished by the Rolling
Stones.
</P>
<P>
   McDowell died in 1972. They also developed a relationship with
Burnside, a blues legend of the same era as Muddy Waters and John
Lee Hooker.
</P>
<P>
   None of the old bluesmen has toured with the North Mississippi
Allstars, which makes the band's name a misnomer. The boys concede
it's a bit tongue-in-cheek, especially when they are touring with
only a core band in which they are joined by bassist Chris Chew.
</P>
<P>
   The Allstars label is more of a collective name that covers
second-generation Mississippi blues players who often tour with the
band and who played on Shake Hands With Shorty. These include
Burnside's adopted son, guitarist Kenny Brown, and kin Garry
Burnside on bass and Cedric Burnside on drums. The album is
enhanced by the piano of East Memphis Slim and the guitar of Alvin
Youngblood Hart.
</P>
<P>
   To see who the Allstars are on any given night, Luther Dickinson
said, you have to be at the show. New friends and collaborators
could be part of the future. The Allstars have been working on a
project with the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, and Luther recently
played and produced on a solo effort by Jimbo Mathus of the
Squirrel Nut Zippers.
</P>
<P>
   When there is some downtime at home, it is often spent jamming
at R.L.
</P>
<P>
   Burnside's juke joint or Turner's farm near the hill town of
Holly Springs, just down the road from the Dickinson house. This is
an area where Luther and Cody Dickinson would one day like to build
their own juke joint, a place where they have vowed to keep a
residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people here are playing their blood and families' music,''
Luther said. ``We just lucked into it. ''

   PASADENA, Calif. _ Syndicated shows used to be primarily if not
solely reruns and game shows, that second genre still holding the
Nos. 1 and 2 spots with ``Wheel of Fortune'' and ``Jeopardy!''
</P>
<P>
   Then talk shows took over, and everyone who could stroll a
studio audience riser while speaking into a microphone at the same
time was given a shot. Thank you, Phil Donahue, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   Now most talk shows are tanking _ Ricki, Sally, Jerry, Montel
and Sally Jessy all saw their ratings drop _ as the next new king
of syndication bringing things to order.
</P>
<P>
   If you are sick of ``Judge Judy'' and ``Judge Joe Brown'' and
the rest of the courtroom shows, there's some bad news coming: Here
comes the judge. And another judge. And another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Hatchett,'' ``Curtis Court,'' ``Moral Court,'' ``Power
of Attorney'' and ``Arrest and Trial'' (more of reality show) are
joining the roster of television jurists.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't even count Laura Schlessinger, who delivers moral
judgments on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Court (shows) has worked as a genre,'' Jay Isabella, director
of programming for syndicated show buyer TeleRep, said at a
gathering of New York broadcasters in Bolton Landing last month.
``You have to give ``Judge Judy'' credit: She took it to new
heights.''
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether the glut of court shows will start
to cancel on another out, just as the majority of talk shows
blurred into background noise.

 &HT;    New screenings and drugs are helping fight the bone-robbing
ravages of osteoporosis
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every morning, Barbara Wenzel gets a dose of preventative
medicine at the A.G. Rhodes Retirement Home.
</P>
<P>
   There, on the shady patio of the Emory University geriatric
center, she visits her 98-year-old mother, Katherine Wenzel, or
``Mama'' as she's affectionately called by her only child, the
nurses and other residents.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine is mentally alert and has ``the strong heart of a
teenager,'' says her attentive 66-year-old daughter. If not for a
disease that quietly eroded her bones for decades, Katherine would
still be in her Decatur home of 40 years with Barbara and their
cat, Missy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it weren't for this danged osteoporosis, Mama would still
be out kicking up her heels, wouldn't you, Mama?'' Barbara asks,
gently arranging her mother's pink bow. ``Oh, we'd go to the
movies, the beach, wedding receptions, conventions for my work,
we'd do everything together.''
</P>
<P>
   While the diagnosis of osteoporosis came too late for Katherine
_ too late to prevent a broken hip, too late to prevent her right
leg from fracturing in four places until it now lies limp and
useless, and too late to keep her spine from developing the
telltale forward-bending stoop called a dowager's hump _ it's not
too late for her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Both women take calcium supplements and Fosamax, a drug that
slows down bone loss. It's the first of several
osteoporosis-fighting medications that is making a big difference
for a generation of women who watched the painful disease rob their
mothers of height, health and vitality.
</P>
<P>
   Family history is the biggest risk factor, and the biggest
predictor of osteoporosis, experts say. But new screening and drugs
can now prevent the disease, even in women who have inherited ``bad
bones.''
</P>
<P>
   Under treatment by Dr. Nelson Watts, director of the Emory
Clinic Osteoporosis Program, Katherine's bone mass has improved,
but the damage to her spine, hip and leg can't be undone.
</P>
<P>
   When first X-rayed, Barbara's bones were progressing into
osteoporosis. Just recently, they've have improved to
``borderline'' brittle, but not before a small slip five years ago
resulted in a broken leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank goodness for modern medicine,'' Barbara said one recent
morning as she wheeled her mother back to her room. ``Or this could
have been my future, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In medical terms, osteoporosis is the disease resulting from
reduced bone density that leads to increased susceptibility of
fractures.
</P>
<P>
   In everyday terms, it is your elderly aunt or grandmother who is
in the hospital again from a broken hip.
</P>
<P>
   And it could be you, especially if you are a slender or
small-framed white woman past menopause, the profile of the person
most at risk for developing osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   Over a lifetime, osteoporosis will lead to broken bones in one
in two women, and one in eight men, according to the National
Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, there are 1.5 million fractures due to
osteoporosis,'' said Watts. ``If you add up all the cases of heart
attacks, stroke and breast cancer, it's still less than the number
of osteoporosis fractures.''
</P>
<P>
   That could have enormous implications in the next few years as
43 million American women reach menopause, when osteoporosis
usually begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole goal is to figure out who's at high risk and to get
them treatment to prevent it,'' said Dr. Felicia Cosman, medical
director for the National Osteoporosis Foundation, and an
endocrinologist with Helen Hayes Hospital in West Haverstraw, N.Y.
``If we start implementing it, we could make a big impact. If not,
it's going to be very expensive for us in another 10 to 20 years if
we don't reach these people and treat it.''
</P>
<P>
   Men are not immune from getting osteoporosis but their risk is
lower because their bones are 20 percent to 30 percent more dense
than a woman's. They also do not lose estrogen, which is the
biggest bone-thinning culprit of women. It's not uncommon for a
woman to lose one-third of her bone mass during menopause. By age
80, some women may have lost 50 percent of their bone mass.
</P>
<P>
   Although osteoporosis affects all ethnic and racial groups, it
largely strikes white and Asian women because their bone structure
is the least dense. White women 65 or older have twice the
incidence of fractures as African-American women.
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, 10 million people already have the disease
and 18 million more have low bone mass, 80 percent of them women.
And like Katherine Wenzel, they and their doctors may not even know
it until the damage is done.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the first indication of the disease is too late _ when
a small fall or bump results in a fracture or a collapsed vertebra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Osteoporosis is a silent crippler, that's why it's so
important to get screened for it,'' said Dr. Kimberly Wilson of
Piedmont Rheumatology Consultants. ``It's an epidemic in our
country. But we can detect it and we can even predict the future of
its course. Most importantly, we can treat it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to look at recommending bone density screening
just like we do mammograms.'' Wilson said. Screening costs are
covered by Medicare and most health insurance plans. The word is
getting around, as evidenced by the backed-up bone-scan
appointments at Piedmont Hospital. The tests are generally ordered
by a primary care doctor or a specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started working here two years ago, I saw about six
patients a day,'' said Pauline Merz, a Piedmont radiologic
technologist who specializes in the field called bone densitometry.
``Now, I see between 18 to 20 patients a day, and there's a
three-month waiting list.''
</P>
<P>
   Many more women might benefit from bone screening. While older
white women are the usual victims, it can affect younger women,
especially if they've suffered an eating disorder, and young men if
they have other underlying medical conditions, such as low
testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Osteoporosis is an equal opportunity disorder,'' Watts
cautioned. ``I have many patients in my practice that are men, and
I have black women. Nobody is immune from it.''
</P>

 &HT;    WHAT DRUGS ARE AVAILABLE?
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   These drugs rebuild bone density and prevent further bone loss:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Fosamax: Acts like glue to help rebuild the bone by binding
osteoclasts, the cells that break down bone. This drug, called a
bisphosphonate, shows a remarkable 50 percent reduction in spine
and hip fractures after three years. Benefits begin in the first
year and increase in the second and third years.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Actonel: The newest drug approved. It's similar to Fosomax but
also helps with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (from arthritis
medications) in men and women.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hormone replacement therapy: Slows bone loss in postmenopausal
women. A 50 percent reduction in spinal fractures is seen in women
taking HRT for three to five years; longer use continues to lower
the risk. Also reduces many of the symptoms of menopause and may
lower heart disease risk, but may raise risks of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Evista: Helps restore estrogen and bone loss. It's the first
drug known as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMS)
approved for osteoporosis. It's an alternative to hormone
replacement therapy, but it doesn't relieve hot flashes or other
menopausal discomforts. Study participants, however, experienced
lower incidence of breast cancer at the same time their risk of
fractures decreased by 30 percent to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Calcitonin: A hormone that reduces bone-dissolving activity.
It's usually recommended for those who can't take the above
medications, because it's not as effective. But it does relieve
back pain from spinal fractures. It's taken as a nasal spray or
injection.

&HT;     ACTION REACHES THE BOILING POINT IN `HOT SPRINGS' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOBBIE HESS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In ``Point of Impact,'' ``Black Light'' and
``Time to Hunt,'' Stephen Hunter created the unforgettable
character Bob Lee Swagger, a Vietnam veteran and master sniper.
</P>
<P>
   Now Hunter goes back to 1946 and introduces Earl Swagger, Bob
Lee's father, in ``Hot Springs'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25, 474
pages). A survivor of the war in the Pacific, Earl is haunted by
the memory of the men he led in battle who never returned. He also
carries the emotional scars left by his abusive and drunken father,
whose actions caused his younger brother Bobby Lee to commit
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Retired from the Marine Corps, Swagger is now working in a
lumber mill in his native Arkansas and is married to a beautiful
young woman he met while on leave to sell war bonds. His drinking
increases and he is slightly drunk when presented with the Medal of
Honor for his heroic actions at Iwo Jima. A suicidal Swagger gets a
reprieve when he is recruited to train an elite team of law
officers whose sole purpose will be to rid Hot Springs, Ark., of
its gambling dens and whorehouses. He will work with the legendary
D.A. Parker, a retired FBI agent who ended the careers of many
well-known gangsters.
</P>
<P>
   Hot Springs is run by Owney Maddox, who grew up on the mean
streets of New York. Hot Springs is a favorite vacation spot of
movie stars and gangsters alike. One day when Swagger and Parker
are on a scouting trip of the town, Swagger has a run in with Bugsy
Siegel. Maddox watched the confrontation and tries to hunt down the
man who knocked Siegel down. After a series of successful raids by
Swagger's team, Maddox hires a lethal crew to take out the raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hot Springs'' is a richly told tale driven by complex
characters, strong dialogue and a unique plot. Hunter imbues
Swagger with great courage, a sense of decency and loyalty. He
deftly fleshes out a real man as Swagger comes to terms with his
past and his fear of impending fatherhood. Hunter is one of the
best storytellers of his generation and he just keeps getting
better.

   ``Listen to the Silence.'' By Marcia Muller. Mysterious Press.
$23.95. 289 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon McCone owns her own detective agency and has a great
relationship with her significant other. Her best friend has just
gotten married at a house in Sea Cliff. Life is nearly perfect
until McCone gets a call from her brother John telling her that
their father had just died.
</P>
<P>
   She flies to San Diego for the funeral and to take care of her
father's personal effects. Going through boxes of papers she finds
a folder that contains her birth certificate and to her horror, her
adoption papers. Her brothers and sisters had teased her when she
was little because she didn't look like them. But her parents
always said she took after her great-grandmother, who was a
Shoshone Indian. McCone confronts her mother, who refuses to tell
her why she was adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Enraged and deeply hurt, McCone begins a investigation to find
out who her birth parents were. The search will take her to
Flathead Indian Reservation in Montana, where she will learn some
of her family's secrets. It will take her to Carmel, Calif., where
she will meet her birth father, then to Northern California, where
the real dangers of the past begin to cause present-day evil.
</P>
<P>
   The author Marcia Muller really brings out McCone's pain so that
readers can feel her devastation at having her whole life seem a
lie. She realistically unravels this intriguing tale, weaving
Indian culture to enrich the plot. A very satisfying mystery.

   ``The Fifth Woman.'' By Henning Mankell. Translated from the
Swedish by Steven T. Murray. The New Press. $24.95. 425 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Mankell's 10th mystery featuring Swedish Police Detective Kurt
Wallander is one of the most intricate police investigations put to
paper.
</P>
<P>
   A woman in Ystad, Sweden, receives a letter from a police
officer in Africa informing her that her mother and four nuns have
been killed in a remote desert town.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, a retired car dealer who writes poems about birds
is found impaled on pungee sticks in a ditch near his home. Another
man is reported missing after he fails to board a plane to Nairobi
for an expedition to look at orchids. Days later, his emaciated
body is discovered tied to a tree. He had been strangled.
</P>
<P>
   Wallander is sure the murders are the work of a lone monster,
but there are few clues to link them. The killings had been well
planned and Wallander is sure he is hunting a very intelligent
madman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fifth Woman'' is hampered by over-attention to police
procedure. This is more detailed than a Tom Clancy techno-thriller.
However, Muller has created a very driven character in Wallander,
whose personal life is almost non-existent because of his obsession
with the murders. An original mystery that would be greatly
enhanced by some tighter editing.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The images were powerful ones. There was the
frail Pope John Paul II asking clemency for prisoners, while brawny
prisoners in T-shirts served as altar boys, cried and kissed the
pontiff's ring.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the bad news in this year dedicated by the pope to
redemption and pardon.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul bitterly condemned gays for holding a festival and
parade in Rome the same year as the Roman Catholic Church's jubilee
year. The pope said the festival was an ``offense to Christian
values'' and that homosexual acts are ``contrary to natural law.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope asked clemency for felons who robbed, raped and killed,
yet gave none to gays for holding a parade? There's something very
wrong here.
</P>
<P>
   True forgiveness is hard even for the pope. You might even say
forgiveness is contrary to natural law.
</P>
<P>
   Vengeance, bitterness and jealousy come much more naturally. Why
else would Christian teachings spend so much time on the subject of
turning the other cheek and forgiving those who trespass against
us?
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to forgive those who haven't trespassed against us
directly, such as felons who robbed or beat up someone else. Here
we must give the pope credit, because he publicly forgave the man
who shot him.
</P>
<P>
   Why not forgive gays? Is a perceived insult, a parade, so much
worse than a bullet?
</P>
<P>
   John Paul went on to say that homosexuals should not be
subjected to ``unjust discrimination,'' but should be treated with
``respect, compassion, delicacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? You guessed it. Because homosexuality is a disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the pope put it more scientifically than that, saying
homosexuality is ``objectively disordered.''
</P>
<P>
   The church has rethought its positions on Galileo and even
Darwin, but it's odd to me that the pope is defending its position
on homosexuality with scientific sounding phrases.
</P>
<P>
   As a lapsed Episcopalian, I don't know much about Catholic
doctrine. But I have one simple question: If homosexuality is
against natural laws, then what is celibacy?
</P>
<P>
   Homosexuality occurs in nature in significant percentages, while
celibacy does not. At least it didn't occur very much in nature in
my neighborhood when I was young.
</P>
<P>
   Even when celibacy is demanded of priests, it seems that many
are unable to maintain it.
</P>
<P>
   Homosexuality seems a particularly sore subject with the
Vatican, much more so than it is with ordinary people, who tolerate
gay marches and don't think about whether their gay or lesbian
cousins are objectively disordered.
</P>
<P>
   The laity does not protest too much, but the hierarchy does.
</P>
<P>
   As an admirer of the pope's intellect, courage and kindness
toward the poor, I was moved by his prisoners mass, and heartened
to see his generosity toward them in a year he has dedicated to
redemption and pardon.
</P>
<P>
   Then he proceeded to show how difficult it can be to forgive and
love one's neighbors. I can forgive him. But if I were gay or
Catholic, I don't think I could.
</P>
<P>
   We could expect better from a great man like Pope John Paul II,
and that's the sad part. He could have forgiven the felons and
forgotten the gay parade at the very least.
</P>
<P>
   If the pope can't overcome human laws of petty bitterness, then
who are we to be infallible?
</P>

THE PLAYERS IN A RINKSIDE TRAGEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   READING, Mass. _ They were two strangers with uncannily similar
lives, similar triumphs over rough-and-tumble pasts, similar
reputations as devoted dads.
</P>
<P>
   Both lived in neat suburban homes with white flowers in the
yards and hockey sticks propped against the walls. They rounded up
neighborhood kids for street hockey games, and tended to be calm
and quiet when they watched their own children play.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, what drew Thomas Junta, 42, and Michael Costin, 40,
into a fight last week _ a fight so brutal that it has become a
national symbol of rage _ was this unlikely fact: The boys playing
hockey at the Burbank Ice Arena were getting too rough.
</P>
<P>
   It's a common problem, parents say, at loosely organized ``stick
practices'' on summer afternoons. The more advanced kids start
checking, and the less-skilled kids wind up crying and bruised.
Junta sat in the stands, watching his 10-year-old son skate, and
worried that things were getting dangerous. So he called down to
Costin, the father who was overseeing the game.
</P>
<P>
   In so many words, Junta told Costin to take control of the ice.
In so many words, Costin told Junta that everything was fine. And
within minutes, an argument over limiting the violence erupted into
a brutal fight, spilling from the ice to the hallway to the floor
beside the vending machines. That's where police found Costin, his
face battered past recognition, lying in blood.
</P>
<P>
   How a request to keep the peace ended up this way, with one man
dead and another charged with manslaughter, is a mystery. The
incident has become Exhibit A in the coast-to-coast lament over
youth sports, zealous parents, and a culture of rage.
</P>
<P>
   But as Junta turned himself in to police Monday, and friends and
relatives prepared for Costin's funeral, a larger question
lingered: Was the tragedy last Wednesday an aberration _ a
testosterone-fueled error in judgment _ or sad proof that a violent
past is hard to overcome?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This year had marked a long-fought victory for Michael Costin:
He finally gained custody of all four of his children. It was a
triumph, it seems, over a checkered past. Because the Costin who
was buried Tuesday _ a quiet, churchgoing man who lived with his
mother and spent all of his time with his children _ seemed a far
cry from the man who wove in and out of the criminal-justice
system.
</P>
<P>
   A resident of Lynnfield for most of his life, Costin was about
15 when violence first struck close by. His brother, Dennis, 17,
was killed in his home of a stab wound to the heart. His father,
Augustine, 42 at the time, was convicted of manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   It was a few years later that Michael Costin _ who grew to 5
feet 11 inches and 175 pounds _ began his own series of scrapes
with the law. According to the Massachusetts Criminal Offender
Registry, he went to prison seven times between 1983 and 1995, for
crimes that ranged from assaulting police officers to breaking and
entering with a loaded gun.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of that turmoil, Costin married a woman from
Ireland. Their marriage split up a few years ago, said Augustine
Costin, who is now 67 and divorced from Costin's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Costin's most recent legal troubles stemmed from a
conflict with his ex-wife, said Paul Dowling, who says he became
friends with Costin five years ago, when they attended Alcoholics
Anonymous meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Dowling said that Costin's children were living with their
mother when Costin staked out her house with a video camera. He was
trying to keep an eye on unsavory behavior he felt was taking place
in front of his children, Dowling said.
</P>
<P>
   Costin was arrested for breaking and entering and wound up in
prison for 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was trying to protect the kids,'' Dowling said. ``He loves
his kids more than anything. That's all he pretty much talks
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and relatives agree that Costin's children were his
life. In recent years, Costin's two older sons, now 12 and 11, were
living with Augustine Costin, while the younger son and daughter,
10 and 9, lived with Michael and his mother. Costin worked
tirelessly to bring them all under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   The children were united in January, and since then Costin's
devotion to his family was all-consuming, said Gene Ellison, a
longtime friend. When Costin wasn't working _ he had a job laying
carpet _ he was organizing activities for the kids, or attending
their sporting events. One woman said she remembers seeing him at
hockey games, often with a child climbing over him happily.
</P>
<P>
   He would entertain his children's friends, as well, said
neighbors, who remember Costin piling kids into a teal Toyota
minivan and taking them miniature golfing, to the movies, or to the
mall.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many of his most recent acquaintances knew Costin only
as the consummate single father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He turned his life around completely,'' said Cindy Sochat, a
mother whose children stayed at Costin's house, and sometimes went
to church with the Costin family.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son spent a lot of time with him,'' she said. ``I
completely entrusted my son to Michael, and even with all this
information about his past I still feel like I made the right
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   If Costin was a jovial, sometimes-goofy presence with children,
though, he was more reserved among the hockey-parent crowd. Though
he sometimes made small talk with mothers and fathers at sporting
events, he often stood alone, watching the games in silence, one
woman said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly the way sports parents in Reading described
Thomas Junta, a 6-foot-2-inch, 275-pound truck driver who was a
regular at his children's hockey games, baseball games, and swim
meets.
</P>
<P>
   In a town that rumbles with enthusiasm for sports, the Juntas
seemed a model famly. Junta's wife, Michelle, coached Reading kids
in swimming, and last year helped to organize a girls ice hockey
team for Reading High School. His daughter, 16, is a star hockey
player on that team. His son, 10, plays a variety of sports.
</P>
<P>
   And Thomas Junta, by many accounts, was a devoted father who
cheered them on without frustration, and was quick with an
encouraging word for other children.
</P>
<P>
   As a teenager and young man growing up in Boston's Charlestown
section, where he played football for Charlestown High, Junta had
his share of run-ins with police.
</P>
<P>
   Records in Charlestown District Court indicate that in March
1975, Junta allegedly broke into a Metropolitan District Commission
skating rink in Charlestown and did $3,300 in damage. Age 17 at the
time, he was charged with willful and malicious destruction of
property. He was later found not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The incident came three months after he had been sentenced to a
one-year jail term on a charge of using a vehicle without the
authority of the owner. Junta appealed the decision, but court
records do not indicate what became of the appeal or whether he
served time.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors Monday said Junta was also charged with assault and
battery in 1992. There was no finding in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Junta's record has been clean, so much so that a
judge decided to release him Monday on $5,000 cash bail. And people
who know him in Reading, where he has been a truck driver for 13
years, describe him as well-mannered and calm, a generous man who
took other children under his wing.
</P>
<P>
   Junta's next-door neighbor, who would not provide her name, said
local children would congregate in front of his house for impromptu
games, or climb into his truck for a ride to hockey practice.
</P>
<P>
   Another friend from Reading, who asked to remain anonymous, said
he met Junta on a trip to New York, accompanying a swim team. As
other parents unpacked their bags, the man said, Junta sat quietly
in a hotel hallway, playing catch with somebody else's son.
</P>
<P>
   At hockey games, too, Junta often stood alone, said another
Reading man, who also asked not to be identified. Sometimes, he
would quietly compliment other children's playing, the man said.
Other times, parents wouldn't even realize he was there.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though Junta and Costin seemed to stay calm, many parents
concede that violence at sporting events is hardly rare. At the
Burbank Ice Rink, which hummed with games and activity on Sunday,
parents told stories of being thrown out of games themselves, or
coaching in the face of a horde of screaming grown-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Sports have become a huge commitment, in terms of money and
time, said Dan O'Brien, who accompanied his son to the rink. In the
face of that investment, he said, parents' emotions can often get
the best of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a parent in the stands who's been at
some sort of hockey game that can't relate to that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When parents lose their temper, though, O'Brien said, they're
usually surrounded by friends _ people who can calm them down and
talk them back to reality. There seemed to be nobody in that role
last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   There were no inner voices, either. If strength of character
helped both Junta and Costin grow into their roles as model dads,
it didn't help them regain self-control this time.
</P>
<P>
   Now, their relatives and friends are left to wonder: Why didn't
they just walk away?
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every day, I think, our feelings change,'' Gene Ellison
said. ``Going from frustration and being angry about this, to
bewilderment. How could something like this happen?''
</P>

SCIENTISTS, ETHICISTS SEEK COMMON LANGUAGE OF NEW FRONTIER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suddenly, science seems to have found God.
</P>
<P>
   Flush with the victory of sorting out the basic language of the
human body, scientists and politicians have turned to the language
of faith in an effort to ascribe meaning to the human genome
project.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, biologists are challenging today's philosophers,
theologians, and ethicists with a variety of difficult questions.
Chief among them: What does it mean to be human if our fates are
determined by a sequence of genes?
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, society's moralizers, citing the lesson of the
Manhattan Project, in which the much-heralded discovery of fission
was used to make atomic bombs, are offering their own challenge to
science: How can one ensure that this newest scientific marvel will
be used to benefit, not harm, humanity?
</P>
<P>
   The rarefied worlds of metaphysics and morality have collided
with molecular biology, and a debate once taking place in academic
journals is being thrust into the public realm.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, crowing at a White House news conference last
week that scientists had completed the first survey of the entire
human genome, declared: ``Today, we are learning the language in
which God created life.''
</P>
<P>
   And Dr. Francis S. Collins, director of the National Human
Genome Research Institute, said, ``We have caught the first glimpse
of our own instruction book, previously known only to God.''
</P>
<P>
   Theologians argue that it is striking _ but not surprising _
when scientists invoke God to explain the complexity of human
biology.
</P>
<P>
   ``When human beings unlock such secrets, they get an appropriate
sense of awe, a sense that here they are in the presence of the
divine, and even the most secular scientists reach for language
that sounds theological at times like this because they have a
sense of the significance of what they're doing,'' said David P.
Gushee, a professor of Christian ethics at Union University in
Jackson, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, many theologians are skeptical: Is this really the
language of God? Are God's secrets really being revealed?
</P>
<P>
   Fearful that scientific explanations for human development will
obfuscate crucial issues of morality, theologians are attempting to
inject caution into the euphoria of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice is that this is no time to hyperventilate, either in
the panic of euphoria or in the panic of terror,'' said Daniel B.
McGee, a professor of ethics at Baylor University in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Debates over the theological and moral questions posed by the
genome project are already underway in a variety of forums,
encouraged by scientists who recognize the risks as well as
benefits of biotechnology, and by non-scientists who are flocking
to the burgeoning field of bioethics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be teaching in the area of bioethics for the
first time next spring, and it's daunting because I'm not naturally
scientifically inclined,'' Gushee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you can't be a responsible 21st-century ethicist without
at least trying to weigh in on these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health is already giving grants to
theologians and others who include religious perspectives in their
exploration of the implications of genetic research.
</P>
<P>
   And in classrooms around the country, professors are encouraging
students of philosophy and religion to begin grappling with the new
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a textbook example of a philosophical tangle, and it's
intrinsically interesting,'' said Jonathan Westphal, an Idaho State
University philosophy professor who plans to take up the human
genome project with his Problems of Philosophy students at Harvard
Summer School this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``One always knew that genetics was a proper science, but the
detail and the power of it is confronting us in a sharper form,''
Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to take the debate beyond universities, the
University of Vermont College of Medicine is hosting the nation's
only effort at a statewide conversation on the ethical issues posed
by the human genome project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're absolutely convinced that public discussion of these
issues is essential,'' said Edward J. Mahoney, the Catholic
theologian who is co-director of Vermont's Community Genetics and
Ethics Project.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney said Vermonters are grappling with two sets of issues
posed by the genome project: the potential for discrimination in
employment and insurance made possible by genetic profiling, and
the more abstract problem of how human beings will view one another
once genetic technology makes some diseases preventable for those
who have access to the new science.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens to our attitudes with regard to what it means to
be human? To have a disease? To be well?'' Mahoney asked. ``There
is a danger in reducing our answers to the genes.''
</P>
<P>
   For philosophers and theologians, the primary question posed by
the human genome project is an updated version of the age-old
debate over free will.
</P>
<P>
   How much of our lives is determined by some combination of our
genes and our environment, and what room is left for divine action
or human choice?
</P>
<P>
   ``The code of life, the instruction book, the blueprint _ all
these are very misleading metaphors that seem to lead to the notion
that we're determined by our genes,'' said Phillip R. Sloan,
director of the University of Notre Dame's Program in Science,
Technology and Values.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan and other intellectuals say the more science reveals about
the role of genes in human lives, the more they need to think about
the role of human freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm assuming genes do play a significant role in determining
every aspect of our humanity . . . to the very core of our
identity, our mood, our personality, and that's traditionally what
religious people have termed the soul,'' said the Rev. Ronald
Cole-Turner, a professor of theology and ethics at Pittsburgh
Theological Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're really going to have to struggle to come to a mature
understanding which gives genes their proper place without making
them the high-tech version of fate. We are shaped and defined and
limited by our genes, but what we do with those capabilities is
entirely up to us,'' Cole-Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the religious and philosophical world gets worked up
over the question of free will, these thinkers are also posing
tough questions to the world of science about social justice,
values, and ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Who will have access to genetic technology? Where is the
boundary between using knowledge of genes to stop a disease and
using that same knowledge to create designer babies?
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, several said the Manhattan Project should serve
as a cautionary note about how science can be used in destructive
ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``We forget all the ways that human beings have used technology
to exploit one another and ruin their own lives,'' said the Rev.
Amy Laura Hall, a professor of theological ethics at Duke Divinity
School. ``If enough people could walk through the Holocaust Museum
and then read some of the stuff coming out on genomics, maybe that
would make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   But few are willing to walk away from a technology that might
help cure disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of people with religious dispositions are saying,
`Don't play God,' arguing that the bodies we have inherited . . .
are the ones God intended, and if you get in there with your
wrenches and screwdrivers, you're violating God's creation,'' said
the Rev. Theodore F. Peters, a professor of theology at Graduate
Theological Union in Berkeley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that utterly stupid. I don't think God had intended
that some kids are going to get stuck with a gene for cystic
fibrosis, and somehow it's immoral for us to go in there and try to
select it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, theologians say, is that more conversations
need to take place before the knowledge about the human genome is
put to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``This raises ethical questions that science itself can't
solve,'' said Ian G. Barbour, a professor of physics and religion
at Carleton College in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been given the power to understand and change the world,
but we must do it responsibly,'' Barbour said.

TIPPER GORE MARCHES TO HER OWN BEAT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and p coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ She was being introduced as a woman now
facing the ``greatest challenge'' of helping her husband become the
next president.
</P>
<P>
   Just then _ with the July sun gleaming on Tipper Gore's plum
pant suit, in a garden full of Democrats invited to this luncheon
fund-raiser by New Republic owner Martin Peretz and his wife, Anne
_ a beeper went off.
</P>
<P>
   Distracted by the sound, her eyes darted about the lush lawn,
the talk of Al Gore as the next president not enough to keep her
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   The Gores have four children. Three of them, she notes sharply,
are ``not Karenna,'' the couple's oldest daughter who has become a
lightning rod in her father's campaign and whose short list of
accomplishments includes moving the headquarters from Washington to
Nashville and dressing Dad in earth tones (on the advice of her
friend feminist author Naomi Wolf).
</P>
<P>
   She also has a grandson _ Karenna's 1-year-old, Wyatt _ and an
elderly mother who lives in the vice presidential home. Then
there's Al's mother, approaching 90 and clinging to the farm in
Tennessee, where she needs constant care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign is something that's happening in my life right
now,'' Tipper said in an interview Friday over tea and cookies in
the Peretz's art-filled living room. ``The campaign is not my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   She seems to mean it. She looks you in the eye, taps your hand
for emphasis, and directs the photographer to the best spot of
light in the room for taking her picture, because, you see, Tipper
is a serious photographer, with some of her work included in an
exhibit on homelessness that will be opening at the Los Angeles
Public Library during the Democratic convention in that city next
month. She uses a Nikon. And hates digital processing.
</P>
<P>
   Without saying it in a way that may insult the campaign, this is
how Tipper makes it clear that she has her own identity. That her
other interests are kept separate from the politics, even as the
pundits are proclaiming she could be her husband's greatest asset
by connecting with voters on the campaign trail _ if only she'd
seek the limelight more.
</P>
<P>
   Especially because women will decide the outcome of the 2000
election. Especially because 26-year-old Karenna is one of the
flashpoints of the turmoil within Al Gore's campaign, now under its
third leadership team since chairman Tony Coelho stepped down last
month, citing his health.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of holding rallies on, say, the importance of
choosing Supreme Court justices who will uphold abortion rights,
Tipper spent some of last Friday under a pink tent at the Peretz's,
whom the Gores have known since the vice president took a class
from Martin Peretz as an undergraduate at Harvard 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support my husband and I love him. . .but that's not _ I
sound like Lily Tomlin _ all of me. . ..We are a living family.
Evolving. We're big,'' she said simply. ``At the same time, each of
us has our lives to live. I'm not the person who's running.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike her husband, she's surprisingly unguarded, and her
answers, particularly to political questions, often meander to
other subjects. And she is no stranger to the artful dodge,
especially whenever the names of Hillary Clinton or Laura Bush, her
fellow potential First Lady, are brought up.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she comes off as a warm, approachable person, with people
skills that are somewhat akin to Bill Clinton's, but with a softer
handshake and public voice. And she shares his love for music.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked in her purse was a harmonica that her saxophone-playing
daughter Sarah presented to her as a Christmas gift because it's a
portable instrument. Her full set of Pearl drums _ along with some
congas and bongos _ don't travel much, but she gets around with
them, having played with the Greatful Dead and, most recently, at
Washington's RFK stadium ``in front of 43,000 people!'' with
Melissa Etheridge, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just feel like we're regular people in extraordinary
circumstances,'' she says, yet she concertedly avoids follow-up
questions that pertain to the campaign, and her life after the
election. Drumming, it seems, is what Tipper wants to talk about,
and the subject brings her to the edge of the upholstered armchair.
</P>
<P>
   Music, she says, helps people find their voice. Proudly, she
recalls how she taught herself to play the drums at age 12, when an
ad hoc group of musical friends needed someone to keep time.
Fortunately, she notes, her mother allowed the noisy pursuit, which
her own son Albert Jr., who still lives at home, has also embraced.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, she played drums on an original CD single called
``When the Ball Drops,'' a a cheeky teen-age ditty about finding
the right person to kiss on New Year's Eve. The campaigner in her
laughs, just thinking about the frivolity of the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Despite having experienced elections before, she won't talk
about November and what she and her husband will do, win or lose,
because ``it's superstitious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have daydreams about living in the White House,'' she
says softly. ``That would be unhealthy.''

   ``Going to prison for a crime that I did not commit is more
painful than death. I have decided that I must be strong, continue
to pray and that the truth will finally come out.''

</P>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Donnell Johnson wrote those words in December 1995, in
a letter to his church from the prison cell, where he sat accused
of murdering a 9-year-old boy a few weeks earlier. The truth did
come out, when his conviction was overturned in late March.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting recently with his mother, Robin Johnson, in the kitchen
of her apartment, and, at another time, in his church in
Dorchester, he handles his letters for the first time since he
wrote them.
</P>
<P>
   Then 16, now 22, Johnson is mostly looking ahead these days.
He's working in the mail room of a local hospital. He has met a
girl he calls his ``special friend.'' In September, he'll head to
Mississippi Valley State University, one of several colleges that
have accepted him. His church, the Dorchester Temple Baptist
Church, has established a scholarship fund for him.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson entered prison as an unremarkable hanger-on, a Boston
gang wannabe of sorts, straddling two worlds _ the street and his
home, anchored by a churchgoing mother. Behind bars, he renewed his
faith, earned a high school diploma, read widely, and emerged
wanting to study psychology.
</P>
<P>
   His five-year prison stay, which took him from adolescence to
manhood, transformed him. It's a journey reflected in letters he
wrote to his mother and others. Now free, but with prison still
fresh in his mind, he's undergoing a thaw _ a period of slowly
coming out of himself, opening up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked this up when I was incarcerated,'' he says. ``I won't
call it loner, but I always, like, stayed by myself almost. Before,
I liked being around people. I think now, it's like I don't want to
step outside my comfort zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will change. Especially through prayer. It's like trying to
make yourself whole again, but it's not like a light switch that
you can switch back and forth.''

</P>
<P>
   Though charged three months earlier with murder, Johnson uses
the sing-song line, borrowed from the rap group Cyprus Hill, as
part of his pose to appear cool, calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it had really hit me,'' he says. ``I thought I'd
be out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   No chance.
</P>
<P>
   It all began in 1994, when 9-year-old Jermaine Goffigan, playing
outside on Halloween night, was killed in a gang-related shooting.
Witnesses said one of the shooters was light-skinned and
freckle-faced, and the young Johnson fit the description. In less
than 24 hours, he was arrested. In 1996, he was convicted of
first-degree murder as a juvenile, and sentenced to serve 18 to 20
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   From prison, however, the early letters are newsy, chatty,
upbeat, all printed in neat block letters on lined paper,
painstakingly copied, he says, from hurried and illegible
scribblings of ``what's on my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So how life been treating you?'' Johnson asks his mother in a
letter in December 1994. He customizes lyrics of another song:
``You gave me life. You gave me all my hopes and dreams. Oh sweet
Mama. Now I realize all the joy you put inside of me. Oh, I miss
you. I really miss you.''
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year-old seemingly can't fathom how much worse it will
get. Surely, someone will come forward to clear him of the murder
charge. That's what friendship and loyalty are all about. ``The
street always knew the truth that I didn't do it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The naive expectation gave him attitude, so in an early letter
he could be flip, borrow the line ``insane in the membrane,'' to
refer to the monotony of the juvenile facility he figured he would
soon leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're mostly in one large room, 24-7. Same old faces every
day. Same routine,'' Johnson says as he puts the letter aside.
``It's like being in a casket but still living.''

   ``I know I was a fool hanging with the big boys breaking all the
rules. Sometimes I didn't listen to you and acted crazy . . . I
wish I can take the pain away and go back in time, so I can change
all my foolish mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   (To his mother, May, 10, 1995) &QL; 
 &QL; 
(end itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As he writes home on his first Mother's Day behind bars, the
early optimism has evaporated. In its place is a new tone of
self-reflection. No ``friend'' has come forward to say police have
arrested the wrong person. Police and prosecutors are satisfied
that the youth they describe as an up-and-comer in the Heath Street
is a cold-blooded ``child killer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the time my perspective on life was starting to
change,'' Johnson says. ``I'd been fluctuating between two worlds,
and just hanging out with those guys sparked all this to happen.''
Police witnesses ``wouldn't even have had a picture of me'' to
identify as the killer, he began to realize, if he hadn't been
flirting with the street gang.
</P>
<P>
   His ``foolishness'' had also provided police with other material
to cast him as a killer. He'd been caught once in school with a
butcher knife. He'd gotten into a few fights. He'd even been
arrested in an unrelated street skirmish. The mistakes buried the
actual, mostly unremarkable life he'd led as the teenaged son of a
churchgoing woman.
</P>
<P>
   He started to see something else, too. The friends he had sought
in the gang were betraying him with their silence. He appealed to
them in one of his open letters to his church: ``Many teens know
who committed the murder but they are afraid to talk. I plead with
my friends. TELL THE TRUTH.''
</P>
<P>
   But the street remained mute. Rescue would come from within, not
without.
</P>
<P>
   ``You realize when your freedom is stripped from you there's a
lot more to life than sitting in jail,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   This time, when Johnson puts the letter down, he and his mother
exchange a glance. Robin Johnson is the first to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I seen this letter, I knew he was the person I'd thought
he was,'' she says. ``It was very emotional for me. I knew that
everything I taught him was in there.''

UPPER CONNECTICUT RIVER VALLEY SHARES MUCH MORE THAN A BRIDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM A. DAVIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORNISH, N.H. _ The covered wooden bridge over the Connecticut
River linking Cornish with Windsor, Vt., is no ordinary upcountry
public works project.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1866, by an unschooled but uncommonly skilled local
bridgewright named James Tasker, it is 450 feet long and the
longest such bridge in the country.
</P>
<P>
   At a bend in the river with an unobstructed view of Mount
Ascutney to the southwest, the bridge is probably the most
photographed, sketched, and painted object in a countryside that
doesn't lack for subjects. It is also a beloved emblem of the
region residents call the Upper Valley, a beautiful place where
people in two states share both a river and a common heritage of
artistry and craftsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   For the numerous writers and artists who summered and settled in
and around Cornish in the late 19th century, forming the colorful
creative community known as the Cornish Colony, the covered bridge
and view of Mount Ascutney were inspirational motifs. To the
artisans in the workshops and machine tool factories of Windsor,
however, the bridge was an example of the fine workmanship that
earned the area the nickname Precision Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornish Colony included painters and illustrators such as
Maxfield Parrish and popular writers of the day like Winston
Churchill (the best-selling turn-of-the-20th-century American
novelist, not the British prime minister). The leading light was
Augustus Saint-Gaudens, the foremost American sculptor of his era.
Aspet, Saint-Gaudens's 150-acre Cornish estate off Route 12A, is
now a national historic park (603-675-2175, www.sgnhs.org).
</P>
<P>
   Sited on a hill overlooking the river with a superb view of
Ascutney, Aspet was a haven and source of inspiration for
Saint-Gaudens and his wife, Augusta. Until his death in 1907, it
was also the social center of the Cornish Colony.
</P>
<P>
   The national park includes the sculptor's preserved home with
original furnishings, his studio, an art gallery, elaborate
Victorian formal gardens, hiking trails, and bronze recasts of some
of Saint-Gaudens's most famous monumental sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   Sculptures are exhibited in Saint-Gaudens's old studios and
placed around the grounds. Some stand in outdoor ``rooms,''
landscaped enclosures walled with hedges. One of the best-known
pieces is the Civil War memorial to Colonel Robert Gould Shaw and
the men of the African-American 54th Massachusetts Volunteer
Regiment; the original stands at the State House in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Others include the once shocking nude Diana, goddess of the
hunt, that graced the top of the original Madison Square Garden
building in New York and was the first statue in America to be
illuminated at night. Also represented is the haunting Adams
Memorial, which depicts a hooded figure representing ``the mystery
of the hereafter.''
</P>
<P>
   There are frequent special exhibitions at Aspet and a summer
concert series Sundays at 2 p.m. on the estate lawn. The series
continues through Aug. 20.
</P>
<P>
   The private Cornish Colony Gallery and Museum (603-675-6000,
www.almagilbert.com), also on Route 12A, is in Mastlands, the
former riverside Cornish estate of Rose Standish Nichols, a colony
member and pioneer female landscape designer. Works by 20 Cornish
Colony artists are exhibited.
</P>
<P>
   Museum director Alma Gilbert is an art dealer specializing in
Maxfield Parrish, and he is given particular prominence. A standout
among the Parrish works on view is a large, colorful mural
depicting a Renaissance festival in which many of the figures were
modeled by colony members. Fine examples of Parrish's work can also
be seen in the Vermont National Bank in Windsor and in the town
hall of neighboring Plainfield, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Windsor boasts that it is the birthplace of Vermont because it
was here that the first constitution of ``the free and independent
state of Vermont'' was adopted. The Main Street tavern where the
framers of the constitution met in 1777 is now the state-run Old
Constitution House Museum (802-828-3051) and has changing exhibits
on Vermont history.
</P>
<P>
   The town's contribution to the industrial revolution is recalled
down the street at the American Precision Museum (802-674-5781).
Housed in a handsome brick mid-19th-century former armory building,
the museum has the country's largest collection of historically
significant machine tools. This is more exciting than it sounds,
and among the objects of industrial precision currently on view are
several rare antique automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary nonindustrial Vermont craftsmanship is well
displayed nearby at the Vermont State Crafts Center (802-674-6729)
on Main Street. The center features jewelry, weaving, pottery,
furniture, baskets, and prints.
</P>
<P>
   Windsor visitors can also watch glass blowers, potters, and
other artisans at work in the innovative See It Made industrial
park.

`NUDE BUT NOT LEWD'

<P>
   Should you bare it all? Think about it: Going without clothes
sure solves a packing problem.
</P>
<P>
   This week is the 25th annual Nude Recreation Week, featuring
open houses, concerts, and festivals nationwide at more than 230
clubs, resorts, and campgrounds throughout North America. There are
35 clubs on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Association for Nude Recreation, nude
vacations are one of the fastest-growing segments of the travel
industry. ``This is the perfect opportunity for people who are
interested in experiencing nude recreation to visit a club in their
area,'' said Gregory Smith, president of the association. ``A wide
variety of fun activities are planned for this year, and there
really is something for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Nude-recreation supporters are trying to communicate their credo
that ``nude is not lewd'' and that most options are couple- or
family-oriented. The nude association says two-thirds of clubgoers
are married couples and 92 percent are older than 35.
</P>
<P>
   Nudists say no-clothes vacations are great equalizers: Without
clothes, no one knows if you are rich or poor.
</P>
<P>
   For information on Nude Recreation Week, call 800-TRY-NUDE or
visit www.aanr.com. The association also produces the ``North
American Guide to Nude Recreation'' with information on
clothes-free vacations on land and sea, including resorts,
bed-and-breakfasts, and RV campgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quilt festival &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The art of the quilt is alive and well. Testimony to this will
be found at the 24th annual Vermont Quilt Festival July 21-23 where
seven of the more than 400 entries will be by quilters under age
17. Quilters from 22 states and three Canadian provinces will have
their works on view on the Norwich University campus in Northfield.
``Many festivalgoers may not be quilters, but they surely are
aficionados once they leave,'' said Richard Cleveland, festival
director. Twenty-one of the entries are by Massachusetts residents.
The festival includes the sale and appraisals of quilts, workshops,
and evening programs. Hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and on July 23, 9
a.m. to 3 p.m. Admission for adults is $7; for seniors, $6; and
under 18, free. For information, call 802-485-7092. Also on the
Norwich campus will be the Vermont Hand Crafters 20th Annual
Festival of Vermont Crafts.

Lipizzans in Vermont &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Original Royal Lipizzan Stallions of Austria are again
performing in North Hero, Vt., through Aug. 20. The program is
under the direction of Colonial Ottomar Herrman, who as a boy
witnessed General George Patton's rescue of the Lipizzans and
return to Austria. Herrman brought the horses to America, where
they winter in Florida. The Herrman family summers in Vermont where
members offer performances Thursdays through Sundays. &QL;

Jellyfish on view &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They have no eyes, no brain, no heart, and they can wield a
painful sting. And, if you head to the ocean, chances are you've
come across them _ jellyfish. The Aquarium of the Pacific in Long
Beach, Calif., has just opened a gallery dedicated to the more than
one dozen sea jellies, as they are properly known. These mysterious
creatures have survived for more than 650 years and can range in
size from smaller than a pencil eraser to larger than a basketball
court, and consist of 95 percent water. The exhibit explores all
the wonders of these creatures, which are found on both coasts, and
tells which jellyfish to look out for. Included is a Sting-O-Meter
where you can safely find out what different sea jelly stings might
feel like. For information, call 562-590-3100.

Scenic highways &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Thirty roads in 20 states have been designated All-American
Roads or National Scenic Byways for 2000. US Transportation
Secretary Mortimer Downey said the roads provide visitors with a
unique driving experience and are considered destinations unto
themselves. Being designated All-American Roads helps preserve
these roads that have become American icons, Downey said. In New
England, the Acadia Byway in Maine was named an All-American Road,
and named National Scenic Byways were Connecticut State Route 169
and the Merritt Parkway; Old Canada Road, Rangely Lakes, and
Schoodic scenic byways in Maine; and the Kancamagus Highway in New
Hampshire. For information, visit www.byways.org or call

Potholes in the roads &QL;

</P>
<P>
   When you're on the road this summer, always read the fine print
and be a little skeptical when visiting historic sites, says James
W. Loewen, adjunct professor of sociology at The Catholic
University of America in Washington and author of ``Lies Across
America: What Our Historic Sites Get Wrong.'' Be wary, he says of
words such as ``traditional'' or ``according to.'' For example, he
notes that Lincoln's Birthplace Cabin in Hodgenville, Ky., was
actually built 30 years after Lincoln's death. ``The National Park
Service does not go out of its way to tell you the cabin is not
where Lincoln was born. In fact, signs tell tourists not to use
flash photography and risk damaging the logs,'' said Loewen. The
shriving and starving image of George Washington in Valley Forge is
also false, he says. In fact it was a mild winter, and ``the food
was monotonous but adequate.''

Sea voyages &QL;

<P>
   You've seen ``The Perfect Storm,'' now what? Visit the new
Mystic Seaport exhibit ``Voyages: Stories of America and the Sea,''
which offers a national perspective on the sea's role in defining
our national identity. Seven sections devoted to immigration,
foreign trade, recreation, inspiration, Navy life, fisheries, and
the nation's rivers feature interactive and hands-on exhibits, live
performances, and videos. The fisheries portion begins with the
start of the 500-year-old codfish industry and ends as Fred
Calabretta, one of the exhibit's creators, notes, ``modern
fishermen are as endangered as the wild aquatic species they
hunt.'' The display examines the unsolved problem of supply vs.
demand. Mystic Seaport is the nation's leading maritime museum with
a historic village and tall ships. It's just off Interstate 95 in
Mystic, Conn. For information, call 888-973-2767. &QL;

Plastic anniversary &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Did you realize that the term ``charge it'' is just 50 years
old? In 1950, a world without cash was inconceivable, but that's
when ``plastic'' was born. In 1949 Frank McNamara dined at a New
York restaurant only to find he had left behind his wallet. That
incident, which he managed to finesse, led to his developing the
Diners Club Card. When he returned to the restaurant in February
1950, he paid the bill with a small cardboard card _ a Diners Club
Card _ and signed for the purchase. In the credit card industry,
that event is known as the First Supper. The credit card concept
soon caught fire, including a movie, ``The Man from the Diners
Club,'' and by 1952 became the first international charge card.
This year, Diners Club earned its third successive Freddie Award
for Best Affinity Charge Card Program. Its Club Rewards offers
points that never expire and other services. For information, call
800-234-6377 or visit www.dinersclubus.com.

   How would you like to stay in a hotel built of ice? Until now
the only place in the world where you could do so was Sweden. Now
the concept is coming to Quebec City. Planned to open in January
2001, the second ice hotel will offer a cinema, art galleries, a
chapel, sleeping accommodations for 100, and a bar where vodka will
be served on the rocks _ naturally.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel is planned to be open for three months each year and
then rebuilt the next winter. Accommodations are expected to be
about $100 a night.

WHY IS THE SKY BLUE? 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Why is the sky blue?
</P>
<P>
   R.M., Jamaica Plain, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. This is a common question often asked but seldom answered.
The basic notion that you need is that light comes in the form of
waves, and the length of one repeating piece of the wave _ the
``wavelength'' _ determines its color. Blue light has waves that
are about half as long as waves of red light.
</P>
<P>
   When light hits small particles of matter (i.e., in the
atmosphere), its probability of being scattered depends strongly on
the wavelength. Waves of small wavelength have more chances to
``hit'' a particle, while those of longer wavelength tend to just
skirt around. You can get a rough idea of what's happening if you
think of water waves hitting a boat: Small-wavelength waves bounce
off, while long-wavelength waves tend to bend around the boat.
</P>
<P>
   The net result is that blue light scatters off particles of
matter in the atmosphere much more than red light does. When the
sun is high in the sky, if you look in the sky off to one side of
the sun, you'll see scattered light and it will tend to be blue. As
the sun goes down, you're looking through a long piece of
atmosphere and will only see the light that avoided being
scattered, and it looks red. Your red sky in the evening or early
morning is the result of someone else on Earth seeing all the blue.
</P>
<P>
   You can replicate this effect at home if you like with a fish
tank full of water in which you've dropped a tiny bit of milk. A
flashlight beam shone through the water will look bluish from the
side, while the light coming out of the far end of the tank will
have a reddish tinge. Be careful with the amount of milk though:
You just want enough so that the fat droplets scatter the light,
but not enough to absorb it all.

POWERFUL LASER CREATES MINIATURE COSMOS BLASTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ It doesn't matter whether you're talking about
a star, which can be about a million miles across, or a galaxy,
which is about a trillion times bigger _ or a speck of plastic no
bigger than a grain of dust. Blasted with enough power, they all
blow up pretty much the same way.
</P>
<P>
   That's the concept behind a series of experiments being carried
out at the world's most powerful laser facility, located at the
Laboratory for Laser Energetics at the University of Rochester. By
zapping tiny samples with a powerful laser beam, scientists here
can reproduce the unimaginable violence of stellar-scale collisions
and explosions, events that cannot be studied directly in any other
way.
</P>
<P>
   Out of these microscale laser bursts, astronomers hope to learn
about everything from planets and exploding stars to star-gobbling
black holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sea-change in the way we do astrophysics,'' Says
University of Rochester astronomer Adam Frank, an enthusiastic
proselytizer for the new technology. ``Now, for the first time, we
have a chance to bring stellar conditions down to Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   The amazing power of a blast from the Rochester laser, called
Omega, only lasts for a billionth of a second, but, during that
ultra-brief flash, its power is almost 100 times greater than the
total energy consumption of the United States. That stunning power
makes it the only facility on Earth that can realistically simulate
the effects of anything from the relatively puny blast of a nuclear
bomb to the explosion of a star _ an event so violent that it
briefly puts out as much energy as the light of hundreds of
billions of stars.
</P>
<P>
   That means scientists can now observe in the lab violent
interactions that before could only be observed from thousands of
light years away, unfolding seemingly in slow motion over a period
of many years _ and in some cases, millions of years. The only
other choice, until now, has been simulations in the most powerful
supercomputers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can recreate the conditions of radiative blast waves in
space,'' said Frank, referring to the energy and debris hurtling
outward from cosmic explosions and slamming into interstellar gas.
``This has never been possible in the lab before.''
</P>
<P>
   The field is so new, even most astronomers and astrophysicists
are not yet familiar with its potential. Bruce Remington of
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, California, a
physicist and one of the pioneers of the new research, said that at
a recent international meeting of astrophysicists, ``people would
stare at us'' as if to say `` `what are you doing here?' '' They
were initially skeptical when he discussed his research, but, by
the meeting's end, he said, they recognized the new method's
potential.
</P>
<P>
   But laser simulations of space have already demonstrated the
power to reveal important information that cannot be garnered any
other way. For example, during the nearest stellar explosion ever
observed by astronomers, called supernova 1987A, matter from the
dying star's center reached its outer edges more than twice as fast
as theories had predicted. Now, laser experiments have enabled
scientists to study new calculations of how the process may really
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a debate that we're still in the middle of,'' Remington
said, but the laser experiments allow scientists to reproduce the
conditions and seem to confirm that there was ``a fundamental flaw
in how people think a star explodes.''
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, it turns out that astronomers' theoretical
understanding of the gases inside of the giant planets Jupiter and
Saturn was also off-base. Equations describing how hydrogen gas
behaves when it is squeezed under the colossal pressures of
Jupiter's interior were wrong, neglecting a kind of atomic
``softening'' under pressure that allows it to be compressed more
densely than astronomers had thought.
</P>
<P>
   Laser simulations in Rochester revealed the unusual behavior of
pressurized hydrogen, suggesting that Jupit_ter and Saturn contain
layers in which the gas is compressed more densely than had been
thought possible. This will change the whole picture of what goes
on in the densely-packed deep layers of these gas giants, Remington
said, including where different layers form and how the planets'
magnetic fields are generated. Theorists are still struggling to
adapt the equations and revise their understanding of what really
goes on in these planets' depths.
</P>
<P>
   While the celestial objects and phenomena being simulated are
gigantic, the laser experiments themselves take place on a tiny
scale. The apparatus that generates the world's most powerful laser
beam is housed in a special building as big as a football field,
and produces 75 TeraWatts of power (75,000,000,000,000 Watts), or
nearly 100 times the total US electric power consumption at a given
moment.
</P>
<P>
   But all that power, split into 60 separate beams that are
directed from all sides into a soccer-ball-shaped chamber, ends up
being concentrated on a target that usually is the size of a grain
of sand or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need both a telescope and a microscope to do this
research,'' said Frank, because the details of an experiment's
results are often literally too small for the naked eye to see.
</P>
<P>
   You also need some cooperative spiders. After careful research,
the laser's designers found that the best way to suspend the tiny
targets at just the right place in the target chamber was to use a
strand of spider silk. Inch for inch, silk is stronger than steel,
and, unlike steel, it doesn't get brittle in the supercold
temperatures used for the experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Any special kind of spider? Nope. Once, just before an important
experiment, the team of scientists found that their spider had
died. One of them just raced home and found another in his cellar,
brought it back, and the experiment went off as planned.
</P>
<P>
   The entire expanse of the laser facility is kept under
clean-room conditions, because even stray dust could explode under
the laser's intense light. When the facility makes a ``shot,''
which happens about once an hour, everyone is evacuated from the
beam and target rooms and the visitor's gallery as well, because
the energy released as a byproduct of firing the laser is so
dangerous: a lethal burst of neutrons, and an instantly-blinding
flash just from stray light that leaks from the beam tubes and
mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   But surprisingly, because the flash is so brief, the direct
effects are much less dramatic than even the laser from a typical
James Bond movie. In fact, Bond might scoff at the modest danger
from absorbing a direct shot from this awesome laser. ``If it was
the back of your hand, it would probably singe the hairs right
off,'' said David Meierhoffer, group leader for research at the
laser lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could cause a severe burn. It would really hurt,'' added
the lab's director, Robert McCrory. ``But it wouldn't blow your
hand off or anything like that.'' That surprisingly mild outcome is
because the 60 powerful beams in the facility produce their
devastating power for only an infinitessimally short burst.
</P>
<P>
   The lasers that are used in industry to cut through solid metal,
or used by movie villains to try to slice Agent 007 in half, by
contrast, are ``continuous wave'' lasers that emit a constant beam.
Those beams have a far lower power output than the giant Omega, but
achieve their cutting abilities by concentrating that power
steadily over time.
</P>
<P>
   New, even more powerful lasers are being built in at least four
places around the world, said Remington, including England and
Japan. Like the Omega laser in Rochester, these are all being built
primarily for the purpose of research on fusion power, which some
scientists hope will someday supply nearly limitless electricity by
harnessing the same power that makes the sun shine.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most of the Omega laser's research time is still
devoted to fusion-related research. A fraction of its time is also
spent for classified research simulating the effects of nuclear
blasts. It is the combination of these laser experiments with
supercomputer simulations that may allow the world to maintain
reliable nuclear arsenals without the need for any actual weapons
testing.
</P>
<P>
   The new generation of more powerful lasers expected within the
next few years will enable astronomers to simulate even more
violent events, such as the collisions of matter and antimatter
that some think are the cause of mysterious events called gamma-ray
bursts, one of astronomy's greatest current enigmas.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Drake, an astronomer at the University of Michigan who has
been doing experiments at the Rochester laser, says that laser
research allows scientists to ``probe never-before-observed
mechanisms that matter for astrophysics,'' such as what happens
when matter is ejected into the surrounding gas and dust when a
star is being born or is undergoing its death throes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we produce in a scaled experiment,'' he said, ``tests
both the theory and the simulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank adds that, with this new research, ``we're just beginning.
. . The potential is limited only by our imaginations.''

`BIG DIG' PROCEEDS KEEP ON PILING UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS C. PALMER JR.  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Big Dig has certainly lived up to its name _ most
notoriously in its expanding pricetag. So it should come as no
surprise that it's growing in yet another area _ dirt.
</P>
<P>
   What was at its birth billed as a job requiring the excavation
of 10 million cubic yards of dirt and other material, a figure
later increased to 13 million or 14 million, is now forecast to
cough up at least a staggering 15 million cubic yards.
</P>
<P>
   That's enough to fill a football stadium 15 times. The average
garden wheelbarrow, by the way, hauls about 5 cubic feet _ or
roughly one-fifth of a cubic yard.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Barnett, the Central Artery/Ted Williams Tunnel's chief
``materials'' official, said the dirt has been coming out of the
ground faster and in greater quantities than his scientific
calculations had projected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the peak,'' Barnett said in a recent interview
focusing on what's been taken out to make way for the Big Dig and
where it's gone. ``We've been at peak excavation rates for the last
six calendar quarters.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the higher volume of dirt pales in comparison with the
Big Dig's rising cost _ now pegged at $13.6 billion _ the dirt
overrun is emblematic of how the massive project has grown in scope
in unexpected and unpredictable ways.
</P>
<P>
   Big Dig officials say the dirt has gone so many places, with
removal expenses varying so widely, that it is impossible to
estimate the final cost of moving all that dirt.
</P>
<P>
   A major part of the dirt dilemma was resolved three years ago
when the Big Dig negotiated a contract with a developer to take as
much as 11 million cubic yards for Quarry Hills, a sprawling
project South of Boston that will bury a landfill to make way for a
golf course, four Little League fields and at least two soccer
fields.
</P>
<P>
   That piece of the dirt removal could cost about $100 million,
based on the $8 per ton the Big Dig pays to dump dirt at Quarry
Hills.
</P>
<P>
   A new park on Spectacle Island in Bosotn Harbor absorbed much
more dirt than Big Dig engineers originally thought it would.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 18 months, 1 million tons of dirt have been taken
out every three months, said Barnett, who carries around a fat
leather notebook filled with charts, lists of Big Dig contracts,
dirt storage sites, and possible dirt repositories.
</P>
<P>
   Dirt is an general label that includes soil, rocks, clay and
other material being taken from the ground, Barnett said.
</P>
<P>
   He also is armed with sundry formulas. Such as: A cubic foot of
sand weighs about 90 pounds, but a cubic foot of wet sand weighs
100 pounds. And: One cubic yard equals roughly 1.6 tons.
</P>
<P>
   That means what's coming out of the ground to make room for the
Ted Williams Tunnel and eight underground highway lanes through
downtown weighs an estimated 22 to 23 million tons.
</P>
<P>
   All that dirt requires the daily deployment of an armada of 400
to 500 dump trailers _ something many regular Southeast Expressway
commuters should be readily aware of.
</P>
<P>
   A standard ``tri-axle'' dump truck, which have three sets of
rear wheels, carries about 18 cubic yards.
</P>
<P>
   The peak dirt-hauling day was June 6, 1999 when Boston lost the
single greatest amount of weight in its long history.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Barnett said, approximately 13.5 million cubic yards
have been taken out of the ground, leaving another 1.5 million
cubic yards still to be scooped out.
</P>
<P>
   While nothing special to look at, the dirt does have interesting
historical and scientific significance.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the material being hauled out is termed ``historic
fill'' because it is being taken from what once were mudflats
surrounding the Shawmut Peninsula that were filled in to create the
modern city.
</P>
<P>
   And the dirt also includes till and clay deposited by retreating
glaciers thousands of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Resembling the consistency of Silly Putty, the clay is dense,
slick grayish material, known as Boston Blue Clay. The clay and
till are widely used to cap or shape landfills.
</P>
<P>
   Other material coming out in smaller quantities includes debris
such as pilings and timbers, asphalt, and rock.
</P>
<P>
   A tiny but unanticipated amount of hazardous materials,
including dangerous PCBs, arsenic, chromium and certain leads, also
have popped out.
</P>
<P>
   To determine whether certain loads of dirt are suitable for
disposal in Massachusetts or must be shipped to out-of-state sites
that handle contaminated material, soil samples are taken at the
Big Dig site, Subaru Pier in South Boston, or at the dirt's final
destination.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett said the oddest contamination they have encountered is a
sizable chunk of land saturated with olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   An early plan to provide clay to some of the 82 communities
statewide looking to cap their landfill never materialized because
of scheduling, high transportation costs and the availability of
cheaper plastic.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some communities will reap the Big Dig's clay windfall.
</P>
<P>
   Modern Continental Construction Co., for example, is ferrying
about 500,000 tons of clay to suburban Melrose to be used as the
foundation for baseball fields in Mt. Hood Park.
</P>
<P>
   Though they have four years to figure it out, officials still
don't know what they will do the last million cubic yards of dirt
they expect to excavate in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a definite location,'' Barnett said. ``But we
have some ideas.''

HIGH-TECH RESEARCH CHILLED BY SPY FEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mounting fears of spies stealing the nation's high-tech secrets
are beginning to take a toll at prominent research universities
such as MIT, where foreign students and researchers are often
barred from helping to build software, satellites, and other
sophisticated items.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year ago, in the wake of security breaches at the
Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and a spate of other
perceived compromises of US national security, Congress moved to
shore up defenses against the export of sensitive technical
information.
</P>
<P>
   But now, an increasingly vocal chorus of professors, scientists,
and company officials argues that the new regulations jeopardize
the traditional collaboration between universities, corporations,
and government, isolate US scientists from foreign scientists, and
could severely inhibit innovation.
</P>
<P>
   At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which receives
more than $150 million for research from the Pentagon and the US
Department of Energy, the problem so far has been fear of the
unknown. No foreign students or professors have been removed from
security-sensitive research projects. But MIT officials recently
declined to submit proposals for two NASA-related projects out of
concern the university could not do the work without violating the
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a chilling atmosphere that has caused a lot of
anxiety,'' said Julie Norris, director of MIT's Office of Sponsored
Programs. ``What we need are clear rules. So everyone, including
industry, knows what they can and cannot do.''
</P>
<P>
   The main problem, university officials say, is that the new
rules do not clearly define sensitive research. And the ambiguity
breeds trepidation: Scientists and military contractors, who often
sponsor university research, will not risk the stiff penalties,
with jail sentences of up to 10 years and fines nearing $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The law changed last March when Congress moved oversight of
satellite technology from the Commerce Department to the State
Department. Research unhindered by the Commerce Department is now
subject to the State Department's International Traffic in Arms
Regulation. The result: Exemptions for basic research no longer
apply and scientific satellites, related data, software, and
components, are considered military munitions.
</P>
<P>
   Now, universities are required to apply for export licenses if
they want to include foreign students, professors, or researchers
in such work as a Jupiter probe or a communications satellite. But
the long wait for a license, the ambiguity over what constitutes
sensitive research, and a de facto limit on foreign participation
undermines many sophisticated projects, university and NASA
officials contend.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists and companies also fear prosecution for even the
unintentional transfer of unclassified technical data _ such as in
a phone conversation _ with scientists from 10 blacklisted
countries, including China, Taiwan, Israel, Pakistan, and India.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent last month to President Clinton's chief science
adviser, Neil Lane, the presidents of three organizations that
lobby Washington officials on behalf of universities called on the
administration to review or clarify the new regulations.
</P>
<P>
   They are ``already having an adverse impact on university
research . . . some existing projects may be unable to go
forward,'' stated the letter, signed by Nils Hasselmo, president of
the Association of American Universities, and two others.
``University counsels have been unable to reach a common
understanding of the current requirements, as advice given by
various agencies tends to be different.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, State Department officials say the regulations
are clear and should not obstruct research. But they promise to
work with university officials and companies to resolve
ambiguities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, meetings held last month with MIT and other university
representatives, NASA, and State Department officials have failed
to resolve the tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are twitching over this policy,'' said Claude
Canizares, director of MIT's Center for Space Research, who
attended the Washington meetings. ``People are worried and upset by
how it's affecting research.''
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before Congress, Hasselmo and others last month
recounted a list of problems universities have experienced under
the new regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, NASA would not authorize a university scientist to
travel to Europe to help fix a glitch on a major international
space-exploration project, despite its cost to the US space agency
of about $1 million a day.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, a Turkish graduate student studying at a US
university has been hampered in developing a new type of rocket
fuel. Midway through the research, the corporate sponsor required
the student to apply for a State Department license before
receiving more money.
</P>
<P>
   And in a third case, NASA suspended a review of work the agency
commissioned from a Chinese post-doctorate student on a ``gravity
probe'' until the student received a license.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem to me is the new regulations scare people
away from even participating,'' said General Spence M. ``Sam''
Armstrong, a senior adviser to NASA's administrator, who has
fielded questions on the new law from schools including Stanford
University, the University of Maryland, Ohio State University, and
MIT. ``What we have lost is not exactly clear yet. But the most
alarming thing is if people are being deterred from joining in the
research.''
</P>
<P>
   Those against the new regulations, such as Armstrong and
Hasselmo, recognize the need for limits on the dissemination of
technical research.
</P>
<P>
   But, they say, protecting such sensitive information from
falling into the wrong hands is not complicated. They support a
relatively simple means of ending the ambiguities: Classify
sensitive research as secret. Other technical data, they say,
should be free-flowing.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Skolnikoff, a retired MIT political science professor who
specializes in technology transfer issues, said the government must
redress the fallout on scientists from its effort to ward off
spies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem I see now is the climate of fear,'' he
said. ``Scientists shouldn't be wary about collaboration. That's
not an effective policy.''

   When Johnson was arrested, he was a sophomore at East Boston
High School, an average but indifferent student. Now he was
educating himself. His body might be confined behind bars, but not
his mind.
</P>
<P>
   He began to read widely _ ``The Autobiography of Malcolm X,''
Claude Brown's ``Manchild in the Promised Land,'' books about the
South African leader Nelson Mandela. ``I didn't learn about my own
people in public school, but I learned it behind the wall,'' he
says. ``History had been my worst subject in school. I couldn't
stand it. Now, it's my favorite.''
</P>
<P>
   His interest took him beyond African-Americans, to books about
Italian and Jewish immigration to the US.United States. What he
learned gave him far more than the high school diploma he earned.
It gave him a worldview wider than the streets he'd left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adversity that people went through _ that just gives you
motivation,'' he says. ``I was like feeding off this.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only was Johnson reading, but he was also writing. He joined
a poetry club _ ``10 of us and a teacher.'' Some of his ``love
stuff'' was printed as part of the workshop, but not the ``more
creative stuff'' written when he let his imagination and feelings
run free. ``I was worried it would be misunderstood,'' he recalls,
``and the district attorney was always looking for something
against me.''
</P>
<P>
   He told a friend of his mother's in early 1997 that he liked to
write ``to preoccupy my mind and to get some of the stress off my
chest.'' It was more than a distraction. ``I think I might be an
author on the side, when I'm not practicing law,'' Johnson wrote in
the Jan. 3, 1997, letter. ``I have all these ideas about story

safety of the juvenile facility to the state prison in Concord.
``Let me know who to watch my back for,'' he scribbled in a quick
letter to his mother on March 23, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got to the adult thing, I could have got killed or
stabbed,'' he says, ``when I never should have been in there from
day one.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was moved to prison, he had changed. He was more
self-reliant, better educated. He'd rediscovered a faith he had
never thought much about before. His letters more frequently
acknowledged the support of his ``loving church family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you believe in God,'' he says. ``But God did
tell me. He reassured me I'd be home.''
</P>
<P>
   The break finally came last summer. Ralph C. Martin III, the
district attorney who'd always said Johnson was a killer, began to
reconsider his position when members of the Heath Street gang,
seeking leniency after being arrested on federal drug charges, told
investigators Johnson was innocent.
</P>
<P>
   With a new police inquiry underway, Johnson was released just
before Thanksgiving. Then, in late March, upon a motion from
Martin, Juvenile Court Judge Paul D. Lewis vacated Johnson's murder
conviction. Martin and the Boston police commissioner, Paul Evans,
publicly apologized and said new evidence had led to the dramatic
reversal of fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't new evidence,'' Johnson says today, with traces of
lingering bitterness. Today, the prime suspects in the murder are
the ones Johnson, his lawyer and supporters cited all along to
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank Ralph for doing what he did,'' Johnson says. ``He
stepped up like a man, you know. I know it was a hard thing to do.
But it's still kind of like, wow, you know, they were always
running away from the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not writing as regularly as he was in prison, but he still
reads, though the subject matter has changed from history to
religion. ``Spiritual books. Biblical books. I get them from
friends. Family. I'm really looking forward to going to school.''
</P>
<P>
   Having fantasized in prison about studying law or becoming a
writer, Johnson, guided by his own remarkable journey, recently
decided to study psychology. ``I'm interested in how the mind
works,'' he says, ``and I want to help people, especially in
one-on-one situations.''
</P>
<P>
   To do that, he eventually wants to go back behind the walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe I went through that for nothing,'' he says.
``It's really disturbing to me, knowing some are innocent, and I
want to be a spokesman for the guys inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying I'm going to be militant against to the
government. I want to work with government. The point is you got to
help these people. I lived through it, my family lived through it,
and the reality is there are other innocent men and women in
jail.''

A GOOD SIGN FOR GORE THAT CAMPAIGN IS FINALLY UP AND RUNNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON -- Give or take a formality, the Democratic
national convention began the other day _ upstairs at the White
House. The picture that summed it up had nothing directly to do
with Al Gore, who was off drawing distinctions with Republicans
that any Democrat can understand.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the picture had President Clinton surrounded by roughly
two dozen Chicago Daleys, as in Mayor Richard and brother Bill, who
has left the Commerce Department and Clinton's Cabinet, on his way
to Nashville and the levers of Gore's presidential campaign. That
would also include their still-formidable mother, widow of
Chicago's patriarch, Duh Mare.
</P>
<P>
   Gleeful politics was in the air. But the atmosphere was hardly
ideological; my partner in crime as writer in attendance was the
right's relentless tribune, Robert Novak, whose home base remains
The Chicago Sun-Times _ a reminder that with the Daleys this
business is more personal than substantive.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was the atmosphere triumphal. At this very early juncture in
an election, the best any grown-up Democrat can hope for is a
competitive, closely contested fight. But the tone was set by an
obviously relieved, happy, and now directly involved President
Clinton.In the president's view, Daley has already made a
difference since taking over the campaign, in two ways. The first
is his attitude that no grumpy Democrats should be on the sidelines
throwing darts, be they the unions guys still smarting over the
China trade vote or the longtime Gore pals shunted aside last year
by then-campaign chairman Tony Coelho. In a Daley effort, the tent
is big and loyalty counts; you want to help and you're in.
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategists point to Clinton's freshly invigorated
involvement as a sign of weakness, not unity, likely to enhance
Gore's vice presidential nonstatus. They have a point, but Clinton
is happy because he has a role, not the role. And he is especially
happy because his role pushing an agenda at a GOP Congress
complements the agenda Gore has stitched together over the last
year _ from taxes to education to health care.
</P>
<P>
   In the president's view, Gore has been helped significantly
below the radar screen since May by a series of TV commercials put
together by the Democratic National Committee, pushing that agenda
and Gore's views in 16 of the state's most likely to be the site of
hard-fought campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   This advertising, however, was not accompanied by a similarly
focused Gore out on the road. To put it mildly, he was all over the
lot, and it hurt. That is the second area where Daley has made his
presence known. A believer in clarity and simplicity, as well as
middle-class, working-family Democratic politics, Daley has helped
steer Gore's campaigning onto an ``I'm on your side'' track,
focusing his attack not so much on Governor George W. Bush as on
the business interests (oil, insurance, and drugs) and GOP
congressional leaders opposing his views, who are supporting Bush.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, that is why the party's convention has in
effect begun. A running mate and happy gathering in Los Angeles
still count heavily, but more important is an effort to stitch
together the hydra-headed monster known as the Democratic Party
around an agenda that unites its presidential and congressional
wings.
</P>
<P>
   This is also the segment of the electorate whose misgivings more
than cover the gap between the vice president and Bush in polling
data, especially when the first-impression sentiments about Ralph
Nader are thrown in. In demographics as well, the slight Bush lead
is the result of better than typical impressions of a Republican
among women, the elderly and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is issue-based. The reverse appears true. Most soft
Bush supporters and undecided potential voters, while vaguely
liking the governor and just as vaguely looking for ``a change,''
also tend to be Democratic in voting habit, in general agreement
with Gore on Medicare, health care, and prescription drugs, and in
general disagreement with Bush on across-the-board income tax cuts.
Gender politics, moreover, awaits the handling of the abortion
issue in Bush's selection of a running mate and the treatment of
prochoice activists at the Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   There is a Democratic case to be made, and what is different
lately is that Gore has been making it forcefully. There was fear
in top Democratic echelons a month ago that however early it is,
Bush might open a double-digit lead in the polls that would enhance
an aura of inevitability. This has happened before without an
elected president on the ballot _ in 1948 for Dewey over Truman, in
1952 for Eisenhower over Stevenson, in 1968 after the Republican
and Democratic conventions for Nixon over Humphrey, in 1976 for
Carter over Ford, and in 1988 for Dukakis over Bush's dad. That is
no reliable prediction of either the result or the point spread.
</P>
<P>
   So far that hasn't happened this year. The reason Democrats were
smiling at Daley's reception was that they are on the same page
again and that Gore is campaigning like a Democrat. That doesn't
appear to have won them much more than a chance to stay in the
game, but for Bill Daley it has been a solid few weeks running the
longest-running Democratic convention ever.

A HUMBLING ADVENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ I was in the middle of nowhere, on the edge of mankind
_ 6 miles down a gravel road through the same Montana mountain
range that Ted Kaczynski used to call home. Thoughts of Deliverance
kept echoing in my mind.
</P>
<P>
   I was in Marysville, a booming gold-rush community of 4,200
residents at the turn of the century, now a ghost town populated by
50 hearty individuals. The dance hall and grocery store still stand
on the dusty Main Street as they did 100 years ago, only now they
are abandoned, the ceilings collapsing among the remnants of the
more fortunate times left behind.
</P>
<P>
   I knocked on the door of a nearby house, hoping to ask why
someone would choose to live in such a remote place, expecting a
shouted admonition to leave or a warning shot fired into the
ice-blue Montana sky.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a pleasant man in his early '30s came to the door. When
I introduced myself, he said simply, ``Oh, yeah, last we heard, you
were in Nebraska. We've been waiting for you.''
</P>
<P>
   He saw my look of shock and explained, ``My mother lives in
Nashua (N.H.). She called and told me about this Globe person
driving cross country. She said I should e-mail you and invite you
to Marysville. Ends up, you came anyways.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, ladies and gentlemen, is Exhibit A in just how small
the world has become. First, there were telephones, and then
televisions, and then faxes and cable transmission, and on this
trip I learned that even country farmers carry cellular phones as
they plow their fields of grain. And now, in the age of the
Internet, there's barely a distant corner of America that really,
truly seems all that far away.
</P>
<P>
   His name is George Darcy. He invited me to sit, served drinks,
introduced his fiancee, Bobbie Zumbrunnen, with whom he shares a
crafts business, the Marysville Trading Company.
</P>
<P>
   They talked of their 40-mile bike rides, skiing on the nearby
hills, the hikes through rattlesnake-infested woods with their two
appreciative dogs. The mortgage on their home and store amounts to
less than a lease payment on a lower-end Lexus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a beautiful town to live in,'' George says, his eyes
drifting toward the Aspen-covered mountains.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Ann Korting stops by the front porch. She
has lived in Marysville all of her 82 years and remembers back when
the town was packed with 17 saloons and her family ran the food
store. These days, she foots the electricity bill for the tiny
church and cleans what used to be the schoolhouse, where she was
the town's teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot that I miss,'' she says, remembering a time when
there were barber shops and jewelry stores and families lived in
the wooden houses that now sit hollow on the nearby hills. ``I
liked it when the mill was running and people were working. I loved
it then. I miss all those friendships.''
</P>
<P>
   I ask why she stayed after the gold rush ended and one of the
world's most lucrative mines was closed, and she replies, ``Because
I've always loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   At night, I come to find, the town becomes crowded with visitors
from Helena, Butte, and Great Falls who flock here to dine at the
Marysville House, where the steaks, shrimp skillets, and Australian
lobster tails are cooked under a tent in the backyard and
reservations are accepted only by mail because the restaurant has
no phone. Word is that if the postmistress is angry that her
husband has been frequenting the bar, she won't deliver their
letters. No one particularly seems to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the quirkiness of small-town America _ a thought that
fills my mind as I point my convertible west for the final
nine-hour leg to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the massive cities on the two coasts, we are a nation
awash in land _ gorgeous mountains, endless prairies, gentle
rolling hills. And on that land thrive a people who are unfailingly
kind and relentlessly optimistic _ filled with pride in what they
have, and hope that their lives will get even better. Such are the
traits of America.
</P>
<P>
   Pulling into Seattle, I think of the waitress in Powder River,
Wyo., laughing as I sampled fried rattlesnake at the Tumble Inn
(tastes like tires, not chicken). I remember a lone conductor
waving a brawny arm from the engine of a train chugging through the
Dakotas. I recall an aging farmer hacking at weeds in a field of
soybeans that spread far into the Nebraskan dusk. He told me he was
``semi-retired,'' though he had been working since early morning.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I spy the glistening waters of Puget Sound. I expect to
feel elated, having crossed this land by car. Mostly I just feel
humbled. The road just taken was long and sweet indeed.

MAKING MONEY THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY IN THE NEW ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a recent newsletter mailed out to clients, Berkshire
Partners, a Boston private equity firm, described some of its
recent investments.
</P>
<P>
   There was Savers, a chain of used clothing stores; US Can, a
maker of containers; Casella Waste Services, a waste management
company; and Active Aero Group, an air-freight company that ships
parts to the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you detect a distinctly `old economy' bias in all this,
yep, that's us, mostly,'' the firm's partners wrote in the
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when much of the private equity world is being lured
by the siren song of venture capital and the Internet, Berkshire
Partners is sticking to its knitting. The company is putting its
money into the kind of traditional businesses it has been backing
for the past 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we didn't have the skill set to be successful venture
capitalists,'' said Carl Ferenbach, a managing director and one of
the founders of Berkshire Partners. ``And besides, we believe in
our core business.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not? By Berkshire's own reckoning, its annual internal rate
of return on its 60 past investments is in the neighborhood of 60
percent. Accurate performance numbers are hard to pry loose in the
venture and private-equity world, but Berkshire says each of its
five investment funds has ranked in the top 25 percent of
comparable funds.
</P>
<P>
   Like other private-equity firms, Berkshire uses its own money
and money raised from others to make investments in mainly private
businesses. In 1998, Berkshire raised $880 million for a new round
of investments. Investors get their money back when those
businesses are sold or go public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider them to be one of the top buyout groups in the
country,'' said Daniel Steele, who manages investments for the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. MIT has been investing with
Berkshire since 1992. The endowments of Yale and Princeton are also
Berkshire investors.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Galante, the publisher of Private Equity Analyst, a
newsletter, said Berkshire has a ``fabulous reputation.'' He also
credits the firm with breaking new ground in some of its
transportation and telecommunications investments.
</P>
<P>
   Berkshire's investments are an eclectic lot. Over the years, the
firm has put money into specialty retailers, manufacturers,
business services, surface transportation (snore), and wireless
communications.
</P>
<P>
   The bet on wireless was a big winner. According to Berkshire,
its $65 million investment in Crown Castle Corp., which owns and
operates cellular telephone towers, has already returned at least
$750 million.
</P>
<P>
   The partners at Berkshire are not Luddites. They acknowledge the
Internet has huge implications.
</P>
<P>
   ``For each of our companies we ask, `What is freely available
information going to mean?' '' said Kevin Callaghan, one of
Berkshire's managing directors. ``Can their value be snatched away?
Is the Web going to be a threat or an opportunity?''
</P>
<P>
   Berkshire sees its role as providing a bridge between the old
and the new economies. Toward that end, the firm recently hooked up
with Mainspring, a Cambridge e-consulting company, to provide Web
advice to its portfolio companies. Some of those companies already
have major Internet operations of their own.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to investment areas, Berkshire prefers to
troll the old economy for opportunities. ``There are a lot of good
neglected companies out there that the world doesn't care about,''
Callaghan said.
</P>
<P>
   Casella would seem to fit that description. The Vermont waste
and recycling company is publicly traded. Its stock has dropped
from $18 a share to $10 since the beginning of the year, in part
because it is in a slow-growing, unglamorous business.
</P>
<P>
   Berkshire reasons that companies like Casella have greater
potential than the world recognizes. They generate good cash flow,
they have limited competition, and they may be able to participate
in industry consolidation down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also still believe in the business cycle,'' said Callaghan.
``There will be worse times again. And some of these businesses are
recession-resistant. They are safe companies to be invested in.''
</P>
<P>
   Berkshire's investors don't seem bothered by the firm's
steady-as-she-goes approach. At a recent conference, they delivered
a clear message: Keep doing what you are doing.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Ferenbach said Berkshire intends to do just that. ``This is
an extraordinary country,'' he said. ``God help us if we can't find
places to put our money.''

&HT;     ANTI-PROSTITUTION CRUSADER RELEASED FROM JAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By PETER HARTLAUB  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A San Francisco man who tried to liberate his
neighborhood of prostitution by bombarding cars with steel bars was
freed from jail Monday after a jury convicted him of a handful of
misdemeanors rather than more serious offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Chin, 46, was arrested in March and charged with two
felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon and two felony counts
of throwing an object at a moving vehicle. The engineer said he
remained in jail to make a point rather than paying the $30,000
bail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent 10 years staying awake every night,'' Chin said after
he was released. ``I think four months (in jail) was well worth
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chin said repeatedly after he was released that his
rebar-hurling days are over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone else is going have to take up the battle. I'm worn
out,'' Chin said. ``All I want is to get some sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mission District resident had testified that he threw the
eight-inch pieces of reinforced metal bar on cars driven by johns
who had solicited prostitutes in his neighborhood. Chin could have
faced seven years in jail if he had been convicted of the four
felonies, but the jury reduced the charges to misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Jack Berman sentenced Chin to time served
and ordered him released. The judge also proclaimed his support for
the jury's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``For what it is worth, the court would have agreed with your
verdicts in all respects,'' Berman said.
</P>
<P>
   Franz Fuetsch, the lawyer representing Chin, said the attention
surrounding the case ``has made it possible, I think, on a daily
basis for people to live a more healthy life.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Maria Bee did not back down after
the verdict was read, maintaining that she believed Chin committed
felonies.
</P>
<P>
   Chin took the stand in his own defense during his two-day trial,
which ended Friday. Chin told the jurors that he felt helpless
after his neighborhood became overrun by prostitutes and their
clients. He said his intent was to either get rid of them or bring
attention to the problem in a court of law.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors deliberated for about six hours on Friday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Chin was arrested in March after the police spotted someone
throwing the pieces of rebar at two passing cars from a church
rooftop at 19th and Capp streets in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   When they climbed onto the roof of the Russian Convent of St.
Vladimir, they found Chin, who was wearing a ski mask.
</P>
<P>
   Chin said after he was released from jail that he used his
knowledge of physics while throwing the rebars, and never expected
anyone to get hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cars are pretty sturdy nowadays,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that while in jail, he met a man who made his
living working the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was locked up with a pimp. We got along fine,'' Chin said.
``We talked things out.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   On the surface, SmarterKids.com Inc. doesn't look like an
e-commerce company whose stock has sunk below the $2 mark.
</P>
<P>
   The Needham, Mass. online seller of educational toys is forging
ahead into new areas such as test preparation and tutoring
services. Last month, it opened a new distribution center in
Mansfield, Mass. _ one of the first designed with an Internet
retailer's special needs in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll stick to our knitting,'' said David Blohm,
SmarterKids.com's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Like many dot-com executives, Blohm hopes to weather Wall
Street's hostility and an ongoing shakeout that has snuffed out
several of his online competitors, including Toysmart.com, Red
Rocket and ToyTime.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, SmarterKids.com has had a tough time shaking off the
association. Its stock price has tumbled from $17.125 on Dec. 1 to
$1.65625 Monday. And in spite of SmarterKids.com's financial and
Web-site improvements, most Wall Street analysts seem less
interested in the company, Blohm acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole psychology has turned against (online retailers),''
said Steven Tuen, an analyst with IPO Value Monitor in New York.
``It will be hard for them to get over the hump.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's slumping stock price also is making it difficult
for executives to meet long-term goals such as growing through
acquisitions. With a market value of $35 million, the company has
enough money to fund its operations through 2001. But
SmarterKids.com may have to raise more funds next year.
</P>
<P>
   Executives predict SmarterKids.com will break even in 2002, when
its revenue is projected to be between $80 million and $100
million. Last year, the company lost $34.7 million on $5.4 million
in sales.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike many of its e-commerce colleagues, SmarterKids.com
began pinching pennies early in the game. The company restrained
itself in the fourth quarter of 1999, when e-commerce firms
splurged on television and radio ads. After dot-com stocks crashed
this spring, SmarterKids.com began cutting its advertising and
marketing budgets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no TV ads this year,'' said Al Noyes, the online
seller's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   By trimming advertising spending, the Web site is effectively
slowing new visitor growth. But SmarterKids.com hopes to increase
its sales by turning more repeat buyers into loyal shoppers.
</P>

   A frequent buyer who has a eighth grader, for instance, might
receive an e-mail advertisement for a game that helps teach
algebra. On the other hand, shoppers who frequently return
merchandise or only seek discounted items would get dropped from
the company's marketing list faster than you can hit your delete
button.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bargain shoppers, God bless them,'' Noyes said. ``But they'll
only come to your site for a bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   The tactic isn't entirely new. Savvy traditional retailers have
used technology to quietly weed through customer lists, plucking
out people they deem unworthy of receiving catalogs and notices of
special discounts.
</P>
<P>
   SmarterKids.com is paring expenses across the board. It has
saved money by moving about half of its shipping to the US Postal
Service, which has become more competitive with leader UPS. And it
has cut more fulfillment costs by packing and shipping orders on
its own.
</P>
<P>
   Before its new warehouse opened in Mansfield, the company
outsourced the work to J.L. Hammett, a school-supplies distributor
based in Braintree, Mass. But SmarterKids.com wanted more control
over its operations, as well as a distribution center that would
meet the needs of a rapidly growing e-commerce company.
</P>
<P>
   SmarterKids.com continues to distance itself from regular toy
stores. Unlike Toys ``R'' Us Inc. and eToys, this Internet retailer
sells neither Barbie nor G.I. Joe. Instead, SmarterKids.com
recommends educational toys based on individual profiles of
children.
</P>
<P>
   At the Web site, parents build profiles by entering their
children's ages, educational level and interests. SmarterKids.com
uses that information to suggest various educational toys and
games, as well as to fine-tune its marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site has used its skills in personalized shopping to
springboard into other areas. Parents can now get information on
how their infants should be developing, as well as what each state
requires children to learn at their respective grade levels. The
site then offers test-preparation tools.
</P>
<P>
   SmarterKids.com recently agreed to provide consumers with K-12
instruction through ChildU, an online learning company. Through a
partnership with Real Time Learning, based in San Francisco,
SmarterKids.com will be able to offer online tutoring for children
in grades 3 through 12, along with workshops for parents.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, the online education store will launch an area that
helps teachers find products for their classes.

   &QL; 
``Young Americans'' begins the way too many WB series begin: The
camera pans through some scenic vistas further romanticized by some
sensitive strumming of an acoustic guitar and the simpering of
another forgettable singer-songwriter. Characters living in this
bucolic Utopia soon randomly blather about how from this moment on,
they have nothing but boundless hope for the future, doggerel that
somehow seems rather more elegiac than sincerely anticipative,
coming, as it does, from the word processor of a writer long past
his protagonists' age.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, there are pop-culture references and/or, if the
writer is particularly pretentious, mentions of people for whom the
show's target audience has absolutely no appreciation (in ``YA's''
case, William Faulkner and Thomas Hobbes). Oh, and don't forget the
relentless flirting between characters who all look like they're
models for magazines like Seventeen or Details and the inevitable
scene in which these kids frolicking in as close to the altogether
as network TV will allow (which occurs less than seven minutes into
``YA's'' premiere).
</P>
<P>
   In other words, ``Young Americans'' is slick, empty, shamelessly
pandering and virtually unwatchable for non-teens; most savvy teens
will laugh it off, as well. It takes place at an exclusive New
England academy where one scruffy but handsome underprivileged
local (Rodney Scott) is, thanks to an ill-gotten scholarship,
rooming with a self-satisfied cutie from the lap of luxury (Mark
Famiglietti); they're so interchangeable they spend most of their
time trying to keep straight which is which.
</P>
<P>
   There's the casually gorgeous townie (Kate Bosworth) for whom
both studs hold a torch, the usual bunch of
good-looking-but-not-quite-as-hot-as-the-le ads, hyper-articulate
supporting players, playing blandly edgy rebels without a clause in
their standard network contracts, as well as the ruggedly dreamy
rowing coach and the lousy father. Most bewildering of all is the
who's-fooling-who cross-dresser (Katherine Moennig), posing as a
boy because _ why, exactly? It's a coed school; she could get in
regardless. Oh, well, at least it's a titillating surprise,
ostensibly, when she takes off her clothes and relaxes alone in her
bra and panties.
</P>
<P>
   Even the hokiest of these fantasy series about gorgeous
high-schoolers living and loving in ornate playpens has to have a
toehold on reality. But ``Young Americans'' (based on this cast,
``Young Aryans'' would be a more honest title) blunders on, scene
after scene, without hitting upon a credible emotional moment. This
show makes the reality shows look realistic. &QL;

The show: ``Young Americans.'' &QL;

academy. &QL;

STRONG ECONOMY CRUCIAL FOR GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although Vice President Al Gore continues to lag behind Texas
Governor George W. Bush in the presidential race, most of Gore's
supporters believe that his issues _ and the continued strong
performance of the economy _ will propel him past Bush and into the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, according to an Associated Press report, began this week
to focus on issues that he and other Democrats see as winners with
the electorate:
</P>
<P>
   --HMO reform, including a patients' bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   --Prescription drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   --An increase in the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   --dditional environmental protections.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Gore hopes to link Bush to the more
conservative elements of the Republican leadership and to the
special-interest groups that he and President Clinton blame for
preventing the passage of these and other Democratic-sponsored
measures that appear to be popular with voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, of course, is hoping to persuade voters that it was
Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, not the Clinton-Gore
administration, who created and maintained the ongoing economic
boom. That is going to be a tough sell; most voters gave Clinton a
second term because they believe he, not Greenspan, gets the
credit.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's challenge is to convince voters he was a key partner in
the Clinton administration's handling of the economy, and that he
plans to continue the same policies.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore knows, as he tries to catch up to Bush in the polls,
that a good economy alone may not be enough to carry him into the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   That apparently is why Gore, who recently switched campaign
managers, has now changed his campaign strategy to focus on issues
he and his campaign team believe will resonate with voters as both
parties move closer to their nominating conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Gore knows that most voters believe the Republican-led Congress
has been more focused on trying to get a popular Clinton out of
office than working on legislation that would benefit the public.
He also knows the GOP is vulnerable to his latest charge, that the
Republican-led House and Senate have been a
do-nothing-for-the-people Congress.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders also know they are vulnerable to this charge, which
is why they are now trying to pass health reform legislation,
though not of the size and scope of Democratic bills on the same
issue. Gore and other Democrats argue that GOP measures, including
rights for managed-care patients, are not reforms. If they were,
they argue, these measures would not have the backing of major
campaign contributors from large drug companies, large insurance
companies, and HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Gore can seize momentum on the issues, he still
lacks one key element that helped Clinton win reelection:
personality.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one reason Bush leads Gore in the polls is that he seems
to be more appealing, at least image-wise. Bush has managed to grow
in the eyes of many voters since his battles with US Senator John
McCain of Arizona in the earlier primaries, to the point where he
is appearing to some voters as more presidential than Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But if Gore's new campaign strategy begins to show signs of
connecting with the voters, that could change. Bush may have a more
difficult time trying to defend the efforts of his GOP colleagues
in Congress in preventing the passage of bills that most Americans
want and need.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything else, though, Gore needs to have the economy
going strong right up to Election Day. If the economy goes south
during the remaining weeks of the campaign, Gore's campaign may
well go in the same direction.

THE CREAM ROSE TO THE TOP AT THIS WIMBLEDON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Oh, right, the tennis. Yes, come to think of it, there
was some of that, too.
</P>
<P>
   The 114th rendition of Wimbledon seemed like a two-week
diversionary tactic, with uproar on the periphery drowning out the
competition on the sacred lawn. But the momentous coronation of
Venus Williams Saturday and the record reinstallation of Pete
Sampras Sunday elevated the game back to its rightful eminence.
</P>
<P>
   Williams's 6-3, 7-6 dethroning of defender Lindsay Davenport was
majestic not in its execution but in its ramifications. The match
itself was an exchange of errors _ 11 service breaks in two sets _
as Williams acknowledged, ``I really think we both were just
feeling pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   But Williams's nerves were less fragile and she became the
second African-American woman in history _ the first since Althea
Gibson in 1958 _ to reign at the All England Lawn Tennis &AMP; Croquet
Club.
</P>
<P>
   She immediately indicated that she will be a most accessible
monarch. That was manifested by her exuberant celebration, in which
she bounded up into the stands to share the glory with her father,
Richard _ who was too busy dancing on the roof of the broadcast
booth to make much contact with his daughter _ and most of all, her
beloved younger sister and unfortunate semifinal victim, Serena.
</P>
<P>
   Venus's triumph fulfilled the destiny Richard envisioned when he
started training the girls in downtrodden Compton, Calif. He has
been accused of being a domineering mentor, but the fact is he
instilled in both daughters a sense of proportion _ the message
that tennis is only one facet of life _ sadly lacking on the WTA
Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Venus, who had bought a gown at home in Palm Beach Gardens,
Fla., before she left for London in anticipation of wearing it at
the Champions' Ball, showed her grasp of balance in the wake of her
triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the match, she said, ``Sure, the tennis part of my
life, I'd be much happier (winning). But winning, losing, money,
riches, or fame doesn't make you happy.''
</P>
<P>
   But she'd better get used to all of the above, except losing.
Davenport emphasized that the recent success of Venus and 1999 US
Open champion Serena presages the Williams Chapter in women's Grand
Slam annals.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Sampras has rewritten the book from the male
perspective. His 6-7, 7-6, 6-4, 6-2 victory over gallant Patrick
Rafter made him the most prolific winner in history. It was his
seventh Wimbledon crown, tying the record of Willie Renshaw set
during the tournament's far simpler infancy in the 1880s, when
title defenses involved playing one match.
</P>
<P>
   More important, it was Sampras's 13th Grand Slam triumph,
snapping the record he had shared with Roy Emerson for the most
success in tennis's four major events: Wimbledon, the US Open,
French Open, and Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras has never won a French, but has four US and two
Australian Opens in his Grand Slam count. Emerson won all the
majors at least once but during the game's amateur era, before
1968. So let that debate end before it starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time will tell if it will be broken,'' said Sampras after he
played tennis for 2 hours 58 minutes and watched raindrops for 2:57
before claiming his ultimate prize. ``I think in the modern game,
it could be difficult. It's a lot of commitment, a lot of good
playing at big times. You never know. There are guys that are great
players that could possibly do it. But it's not easy.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, in fact, as difficult to grasp as it was to set.
</P>
<P>
   ``With everything that's happened, I'd say this is one of my
best moments,'' said Sampras. ``Over time, I'll appreciate it much
more than I am right now. I'm sure as the months and years go by,
I'll look back at these two weeks as the most diffiuclt, the most
satisfying.''
</P>
<P>
   And the most unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   Until those precious moments, the women's side was more
disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   A genuinely disturbing matter was the allegation of Alexandra
Stevenson _ a tabloid sensation last year when it was revealed that
her mystery father was basketball great Julius Erving _ that she
had been subjected to racial slurs and harassment during her rookie
WTA Tour season. Alexandra's obtrusive mother, former Boston
television sportscaster Samantha Stevenson, is always within her
shadow, even at press conferences. And it seemed that media-savvy
Mom was manipulating the news allotment as Alexandra parceled out
the dirt in doses. At one press conference, she was generally vague
about the charges she and her mother had lodged in a London
newspaper. Then in her farewell address after she'd been eliminated
in the third round, Alexandraa felt free to unburden herself of the
specifics, targeting two French women: Amelie Cocheteux had called
her a ``piece of (expletive) black girl,'' she said, and both
Cocheteux and Anne-Gaelle Sidot had engaged in physical
confrontations with the 19-year-old and her mother.
</P>
<P>
   If true, the offenses are damnable. Cocheteux denied making the
slur and Sidot said she had pulled down the bill of Samantha
Stevenson's cap only after Stevenson had made a derogatory remark
to her. The WTA Tour issued a statement saying it had investigated
all the allegations and found no grounds for punitive measures.
</P>
<P>
   The French also were involved in an internal flap. Nathalie
Tauziat's tell-all tome, ``The Underside of Women's Tennis,'' was
so popular that three of her countrywomen _ Amelie Mauresmo, Julie
Halard-Decugis, and Sandrine Testud _ threatened to boycott the
Olympics if the author is chosen for the French team.
</P>
<P>
   On the court, there were distractions aplenty. Anna Smashnova
felt she was being heckled by the husband of her second-round
opponent, Katalin Marosi-Aracama, and took retaliatory measures,
firing a ball into the stands at him. But she committed a head
fault, missing her target and beaning a woman spectator, for which
Smashnova won herself a fine from the WTA.
</P>
<P>
   One of Anna Kournikova's doubles matches was interrupted by a
35-year-old wearing nothing but the slogan of the Russian's
omnipresent sports bra ads, ``Only the balls should bounce,'' on
his chest. The intruder, Mark Edwards, described himself as a
``professional streaker'' but did not indicate the college at which
he'd learned the trade.
</P>
<P>
   Kournikova's doubles partner, Natasha Zvereva, was the
instigator rather than the recipient of undesirable attention. She
made an obscene gesture to the crowd late in the duo's semifinal
loss to the Williamses and was fined $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   History, the very foundation of the so-called Millennium
Championships, was offensive to at least one participant. While 65
former champions and finalists were being honored with a parade at
Centre Court, Jennifer Capriati complained to a referee that the
musical accompaniment was bothering her during her third-round
match. Perhaps she thought it was coming from a car radio and could
be turned off. At any rate, the band and Capriati played on.
</P>
<P>
   Had there been a trophy for boorishness, Damir Dokic would have
been the leader in the clubhouse _ except that he was nearly banned
from it. After his daughter, eventual semifinal loser Jelena, won
an early match, her father celebrated by brandishing a flag of St.
George, denouncing part of the local citizenry as ``fascist,''
exalting the WTA as ``criminal and poison,'' smashing a TV
reporter's cell phone, and trying to settle the damages with a
credit card that the journalist rejected while demanding cash.
Dokic was taken into police custody and avoided jail time _ which
would have given ``cell phone'' a whole new meaning _ only because
the sportscaster declined to press charges.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the ultimate novelty act, the unprecedented
semifinal clash of clan, Williams vs. Williams. While the sisters
insisted they were thrilled about the circumstances because it
guaranteed that one of them would be in the final, their demeanor
on Centre Court before, during, and after Venus's straight-set
victory belied any sense of pleasure amid the worldwide scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The men were hardly one-dimensional, either.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Tarango followed a five-set, four-hour loss to Paul
Goldstein by refusing the customary handshake from his fellow
Stanford alum. Then Tarango accused Goldstein of unsportsmanlike
conduct because he was treated twice before his opponent's serves
late in the match for an injury Tarango claimed was phony.
Goldstein pleaded innocence; Tarango could have pleaded ignorance
for his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras was another sideshow source. His march toward history
became a limp after he developed tendinitis in the lower left leg
just before his second-round victory over Karol Kucera. Then he was
displeased with the lack of vigor in Jonas Bjorkman's handshake
after a fourth-round match and said it was indicative of a smear
campaign against him by ATP Tour colleagues who doubted the extent
of his injuries. Bjorkman said that's always the way he shakes
hands when he's just been crushed.
</P>
<P>
   Blessedly, the championships eclipsed all the preliminary acts.

   A few items to share while I search for this column's permanent
name . . .
</P>
<P>
   --Tim Duncan was expected to re-sign with the San Antonio Spurs
Tuesday. The free agent center had spent about nine days deciding
between offers from the Spurs and Orlando Magic. The Celtics,
obviously, had no chance of signing Duncan. But wouldn't it have
been intriguing if they had given themselves that chance?
</P>
<P>
   It sounds unrealistic, but it might have happened if Rick Pitino
had come to Boston along with an experienced general manager. For
the record, I love Pitino as a coach. If your team was in a tie
game with five seconds left, you would want Pitino designing your
final play. He is a sideline genius. In the front office, though,
you don't want him home alone.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics could have been players in this free agent season if
they had kept Chauncey Billups, Ron Mercer, Dee Brown, and Pervis
Ellison from Pitino's first team. All are free agents now, which
means that Boston would have the option of re-signing them
(unlikely) or clearing their cap space and going after Duncan,
Grant Hill, or a combination of two medium-priced free agents (more
likely). Pitino still could have made the Travis Knight-Tony Battie
deal and he would have had even more room.
</P>

   Instead, the Celtics are standby passengers, waiting to talk

   --So, where do you stand? Did Roger Clemens bean Mike Piazza

I'd be calling Johnnie Cochran this morning.
</P>
<P>
   --Orlando Brown, the 350-pound Cleveland lineman who was struck

   --I'm going to miss Keyshawn Johnson vs. Ty Law twice a season.
Law is the Patriots cornerback who is confident enough to believe
that he can play offense; Number 19 (as Johnson likes to call
himself) is the Buccaneers receiver confident enough to believe he
can play offense _ on a basketball court. During an unusual
interview in which he would have talked for five hours if I had let
him, the 6-foot-4-inch Johnson claimed that he could have played
college ball. ``Could I play for North Carolina? Probably not,'' he
said. ``Could I play for Pepperdine? Yeah.'' What about Fordham?

he would certainly have a problem with the self-proclaimed

You'll remember a lot of things about him, many of them negative.
But don't be surprised when he is a first-ballot Hall of Famer. He
was that good.

Beach and Venus Williams's mastery at Wimbledon have me thinking of
golf and tennis lessons.

TWO OF THE BEST PUBLIC GARDENS IN AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early in the last century two cousins living six miles apart on
opposite sides of the Delaware/Pennsylvania border created two very
fine gardens. They were also very large, about a thousand acres
each.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of letting their paradises die with them, as people
usually do, the cousins endowed theirs and opened them to the
public. Today Longwood Gardens and Winterthur survive as two of the
best public gardens in America and have helped turn the region
southwest of Philadelphia into America's top botanical tourist
destination.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a million people a year visit Longwood Gardens near
Kennett Square, Pa., the creation of Pierre S. du Pont. He was
chairman of both the Du Pont Co. (1919-1940) and General Motors
(1920-1929), two presumably well-paying jobs. He bought the initial
202 acres in 1906 to preserve old trees on it that someone wanted
to log off and ended up adding about 800 acres more and turning the
estate into an amazing horticultural display garden that rivals the
best in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Delaware, his slightly younger second cousin Henry
Francis du Pont inherited Winterthur from his father in 1927.
Inspired by the folk art collection of yet another cousin, Electra
Havemeyer Webb, who was in the process of creating Vermont's
Shelburne Museum, this du Pont increased the mansion's size to
almost 200 rooms and filled them with the best antique American
furniture, china, and architectural bits and pieces that his money
could buy. He was ready to spend every cent he had on it and,
during the Depression, almost did.
</P>
<P>
   H.F. was a hands-on kind of guy who did not have to report to an
office. Instead he turned the gentleman's farm he inherited into a
prize-winning dairy operation and supervised planting the
surrounding woodlands with tens of thousands of flowering trees,
azaleas, and wildflowers.
</P>
<P>
   In this he was abetted by the pioneering Boston-trained
landscape architect Marian Cruger Coffin, whose motto was that
money, maintenance, and manure could achieve miracles. And with
H.F., she proved her point. Today Winterthur is the world's leading
museum of American decorative arts set in a vast naturalistic
garden that provides a lovely frame for the collection.
</P>
<P>
   May is the peak time for both gardens, which require a day
apiece, especially if you visit Winterthur's spectacular period
rooms of antique furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Longwood spares no expense to mount a 12-month display in its
complex of 20 greenhouses. There's a festival with 15,000
chrysanthemums in November. The conservatory Christmas show
features blooms, choral concerts, and colorful fountains against
the backdrop of 400,000 outdoor lights.
</P>
<P>
   Longwood combines horticulture with 400 performing arts events
each year to keep the calendar full. A 2,000-seat outdoor theater
has a 10-foot-high water curtain composed of hundreds of individual
jets that form an opaque screen that rises and falls between
performers and the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Another even larger fountain garden provides illuminated
displays on summer nights; they are accompanied on four special
nights by fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   August features also include artificial ponds with tropical
waterlilies with seven-foot lily pads.
</P>
<P>
   The 80 acres devoted to high-maintenance gardening would make a
French king feel right at home. There are groves of wisterias
trained and pruned into tree form to look like purple weeping
willows when blooming in mid-May. There's even a topiary garden.
Idea gardens contain information on the latest cultivars of
annuals, perennials, roses, vegetables, herbs, ground covers,
ornamental grasses, and vines with suggestions on how homeowners
might make use of them.
</P>
<P>
   On my mid-April visit I saw live willow branches simultaneously
woven and planted to take root and grow into living huts and
sculptures, a garden foll that first caught on in England. Some
90,000 tulips were blooming in dozens of combinations in
600-foot-long beds. Any gardener who has tried to create drama by
pairing varieties of tulips knows how easily such matchmaking can
resemble a blind date gone awry, thanks to the varying forms,
heights, and bloom times of this diverse plant.
</P>
<P>
   But Longwood was characteristically helpful in labeling each
tulip variety so home gardeners could painlessly duplicate the
combinations they found appealing. I liked the mix of Pink
Impression and Ivory Floradale Darwin hybrid tulips best. Other
winning combos included a mix of red, white, and pink double early
tulips (Schoonard, Electra, and Peach Blossom) and also orange
fritillaria imperials combined with Orange Monarch and Queen of the
Night triumph tulips and Melody Purple pansies.
</P>
<P>
   On that visit I was also cheered to see native dogwood trees,
long devastated by widespread disease, once again putting on a good
show. Casey Score, who's in charge of integrated pest management
for Longwood, said that some years are better than others, and that
a program of pruning out dead wood and watering is followed through
the summer. ``Also, people like to use dogwoods as specimens, but
they're naturally understory trees that do better with a little
shade,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even in spring, the outdoor garden can't upstage the ever
changing year-round series of shows mounted inside the
high-ceilinged glass conservatories, which cover almost four acres.
I saw an indoor recirculating ``river'' with lifesize bronze cranes
wading off shores of cymbidium orchids that is an unforgettable
vision for any first-time visitor. Huge spheres of plants cascaded
from the ceilings like flowering chandeliers.
</P>
<P>
   Towering delphiniums rose toward the ceiling like stalagmites in
a floral cavern. One of the world's largest organs with 10,010
pipes, also housed in the conservatory complex, rumbled in the
background.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Winterthur
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Winterthur offers another memorable but totally different
experience. It is as understated and naturalistic as Longwood is
flamboyant and formal.
</P>
<P>
   While Longwood boasts 20 indoor and 20 outdoor gardens,
Winterthur is a single seamless natural landscape, with a large
population of wildlife, including the rare wood ducks that nest in
its series of ponds.
</P>
<P>
   The high points of my visit to Winterthur included seeing a pair
of foxes racing across an open field and a determined bluebird
chasing a tree swallow away from its nest. Anyone who has ever put
up a bluebird box knows how rare it is to actually find a bluebird
in one, but at Winterthur most of the 45 nest boxes dotting the
rolling fields were mounted by an occupying blue sentinel during my
visit.
</P>
<P>
   After years of benign neglect, the garden at Winterthur has been
restored over the last decade under the leadership of Tom Buchter,
former head of the New England Wildflower Society in Framingham,
Mass. His first job was not to plant but to remove unwanted plants
that had seized the opportunity to seed themselves and grow large
enough to obscure the views H.F. had carefully created, shade out
his ornamental plantings, and obscure the architectural lines of
the Italianate garden Coffin designed behind the mansion. When
volunteer viburnums were removed from the understory, thousands of
daffodils that had long lain dormant began to bloom again.
</P>
<P>
   Winterthur has no formal fountains but it is rich in natural
springs that produce a watershed critical to the area's drinking
water, so its 26 gardeners have cut back to a minimal use of
gardening chemicals. The museum has just completed an environmental
management study to encourage wildlife, including the uncommon
Appalachian azure butterfly that frequents the azalea woods where
black cohosh serves as host plant for the caterpillars.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new garden is being installed especially for children
called ``Enchanted Woods''; it will open next June. The area will
include a giant elevated ``Bird's Nest,'' a Maypole, seating for
storytelling, and an ``Acorn Tearoom,'' encircled by old stone
columns around child-sized furnishings. A ``Faerie Cottage'' and a
``Forbidden Faerie Ring'' of wooden mushrooms will deliver an
unexpected misting to the adventurous child who dares step within,
adding to the region's legacy of magic.

GETTING AN EDUCATION ON MALTA 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS

<P>
   VALLETTA, Malta _ When I told people I hoped to travel to Malta,
the general reaction was: ``Where is Malta? Who owns it? What
language do they speak there? Why are you going?''
</P>
<P>
   The questions came with other gratuitous comments: ``Is that
where Bogie's Maltese falcon came from?'' Or, ``I have a Maltese
cat.''
</P>
<P>
   I am embarrassed to say I didn't know that much about Malta,
myself, and casting off, as I did, on a last-minute trip there
after a stay in Sicily, I didn't have time to read up on it.
</P>
<P>
   When I learned that the Maltese islands were some 60 miles south
of Sicily and reachable by plane or ferry, I decided I had to go.
Since the ferries were not yet on a regular schedule _ it was early
April _ I took a 25-minute Air Malta flight from Catania, Sicily,
to Valletta, Malta's capital.
</P>
<P>
   At Catania airport, I met Irene Weaver, who told me her husband,
Stephen, was on the staff of the American embassy in Malta and that
her family lived in Brockton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   This confirmed for me that Malta was, indeed, an independent
republic (since 1964), with a parliament (which I later visited in
Valletta), a prime minister, and a president, all things I should
have known and not just surmised.
</P>
<P>
   When we arrived in Malta, I shared a taxi with Irene to Sliema,
where she lived and where I would be staying, and learned that she
had been a medevac nurse in southeast Asia when her husband was
with the embassy in Singapore. She said she would have a friend,
Clotilde Mifsud, call me and fill me in on what I should see and,
in particular, what I should know about Malta, which turned out to
be a lot.
</P>
<P>
   On the map, Malta appears to be several tiny specks, much
smaller than Sicily, which is about the size of New Hampshire. Two
of the five islands are uninhabited islets; one, Comino, has a few
farmers; and the other two, Malta and Gozo, are the main ones.
</P>
<P>
   The island called Malta is about the size of Martha's Vineyard.
I was astounded on the ride from the airport to find a brightly-lit
metropolis instead of a small tropical island.
</P>
<P>
   While Malta doesn't have many sandy beaches, its rocky coastline
offers breathtaking views of the Mediterranean and opportunities
for water sports.
</P>
<P>
   In early spring, purple blossoms of the Judas tree, blooming fig
and fruit trees dot the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   In the lovely resort town of Sliema, Clotilde, who is of Maltese
parentage, operates Goddess Tours to Malta but she lives part of
the year in Portsmouth, N.H. I learned some things _ mainly that my
five days in Malta were not enough _ on a walking tour with her
along Sliema's winding cobblestone streets.
</P>
<P>
   She told me that the ubiquitous covered wooden balconies,
painted in vivid blues and greens, on the limestone rowhouses were
a carryover from times when Malta was ruled by the Arabs or the
Spaniards. The balconies served as sort of a modesty shield,
Clotilde said, for women who might want to look out on the street
below without revealing too much of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   However, a Maltese man I later met disputed this story, but his
explanation was not so romantic.
</P>
<P>
   From Clotilde and the tours I took with S. Mifsud &AMP; Sons Ltd.,
or SMS, one of Malta's premier tour operators, I learned that Malta
has some of the world's oldest temples and monuments, going back to
4000 BC to the Neolithic, or Stone Age, and predating the pyramids
in Egypt and Stonehenge on England's Salisbury Plain, and that its
history and culture were unique.
</P>
<P>
   I learned the importance in Malta's history of the Knights of
St. John of Jerusalem, a crusader and hospitaler order founded in
the 11th century to care for sick pilgrims in the Holy Land. In
1291, after long combat with the Turks, the Knights, now more
popularly known as the Knights of Malta, left the Holy Land for
Rhodes and, in 1530, came to Malta.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish king, Charles V, who then ruled Malta, donated the
Maltese islands to the Knights for an annual rental of one
peregrine falcon. The Knights' reign lasted 268 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Bogart film, ``The Maltese Falcon,'' revolves around a
Maltese falcon statue of solid gold, covered with jewels and
coveted by Sidney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre.
</P>
<P>
   While Malta's culture, its prehistoric ruins, and its history
have few parallels, I found the civility of its warm and friendly
people, many of whom are fluent in several languages, to be one of
its greatest assets.
</P>
<P>
   There was Charlie, a taxi driver who came to my hotel to take me
on what should have been a 10-minute trip to the suburb of
Madliena. A Boston friend suggested I look up her cousin in Malta
and, when I did, Valerie Wood invited me for tea at her Madliena
villa.
</P>
<P>
   (Valerie was born in Malta and married an Englishman and is one
of the few women invested as a member in the Order of Malta for her
charitable work in both England and Malta.)
</P>
<P>
   The 10 minutes Valerie said the trip would take stretched to
almost an hour with Charlie and I flying through red lights and
zooming up and down cliffs trying to find her. It was a feat of
derring-do sadly familiar among both Maltese and Boston drivers.
</P>
<P>
   We had agreed on a fare beforehand though neither Charlie nor I
spoke the other's language. Now, he was indicating it would cost
much more. Once he stopped for directions at a farm stand and got a
bag of ful, a large green broad bean, but no directions. In the
taxi, he snapped the pod and gave me a bean. When we finally got to
Valerie's, Charlie refused to accept the extra fare. The shared ful
must have bonded us.
</P>
<P>
   There was the waitress. Before I had figured out Malta's money,
she refused to take a tip from my outstretched hand, saying, ``Our
pleasure to serve you was enough.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sliema, I stayed at the handsome, balconied Crowne Plaza
Hotel, overlooking the Mediterranean, where the accommodating staff
mirrored that general goodwill and the fare included a sumptuous
breakfast with a variety of Malta's famous home-baked crusty
breads.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder more and more tourists are visiting Malta, among them
increasing numbers of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Marika Doublet of the Malta Tourism Authority in Valletta said
the number of tourists over the last 10 years has increased
dramatically, with American tourism showing an upswing of 7,019
visitors in 1980 compared with 18,558 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Farrugia, the ebullient manager of the the groups and
cruises department for SMS tours, said more and more cruise ships
are making Malta a destination and that many of the passengers are
American.
</P>
<P>
   American business presence is also evident. I was surprised to
see not only a McDonald's, but a Burger King, Pizza Hut, Kentucky
Fried Chicken, and, most recently, a TGIFriday's, the last in what
looks to have been a small medieval castle. Scenes in the film
``Gladiator'' were shot here. There is also a Marks &AMP; Spencer, the
British apparel shop.
</P>
<P>
   When I was in Malta in April, the American dollar wasn't faring
too well against the Malta pound, or Malta lira, as it is also
called _ one pound cost about $3. As of a week ago, a dollar was
worth .43 lira.
</P>
<P>
   The language, a Semitic one with Arabic roots, was another
surprise. While I was expecting Italian, French, and English, I
found the tongue not at all recognizable. English is an official
language _ Malta was a British colony for more than 150 years. _
and so is Maltese, a befuddling melange of Phoenician (the
Phoenicians are believed to be the first known people to settle in
Malta in the 9th century BC), Arabic, Italian, Spanish, French, and
English.
</P>
<P>
   All these people, over the years, ruled Malta, coveting not only
its natural beauty and mild climate but its strategic location in
the heart of the Mediterranean between Europe and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The Maltese language only adds to the country's exotic aura as
do the Arabic-sounding names of its towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
   Try pronouncing names on the map of Malta like Burmarrad,
Naxxar, San Gwann, Msida, Hamrun, Tarxien, Zejtun, Birzebbuga,
Marsaxlokk, Siggiewi, and Zurrieq. `'Triq'' is seen on many signs.
It means ``street.''
</P>
<P>
   Malta is still a strategic port. When I was there, the HMS
Illustrious , fresh from a relief mission to flood-devastated
Mozambique, was in Grand Harbour.
</P>
<P>
   The Malta Independent, one of the nation's several newspapers,
reported that during World War II, an earlier namesake of the
aircraft carrier defended the vital Malta convoy, was heavily
damaged by bombing in 1941, and repaired by Maltese workers. During
the war, Malta was heavily bombed by Germany and Italy. In 1989,
presidents Bush and Gorbachev held a summit on the Soviet cruise
ship Maxim Gorky in Malta Harbor.

WALKING AND DINING WITH CAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Silent Cal isn't all that silent after all.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Coolidge, the president with a reputation for reticence,
is the latest historical figure to be portrayed in a walking tour
of Boston that is spiced with lots of conversation and subtle good
humor. And Coolidge, ably played by actor-historian Jim Cooke,
would have been well qualified to reminisce about Boston. He was,
after all, a Massachusetts legislator, lieutenant governor, and
governor before becoming vice president and, in 1923, president.
</P>
<P>
   Participants take a quick trip to the 1920s during the
three-hour tour, titled ``Coolidge's Boston: Beans, Brahmins &AMP;
Bulfinch,'' which includes lunch. Everything begins at 1 Milk St.,
at the old Boston Transcript building in the heart of what was once
the city's thriving Newspaper Row. From there, Coolidge, complete
with straw hat, natty suit, and Yankee accent, leads walkers down
Washington Street to show them the Adams House, where he lived for
a dollar a day as a state representative in 1906, and where as
governor in 1920 he learned that he'd been nominated for vice
president. En route, he recognizes a portion of Filene's department
store but little else, and when he reaches the site of the Adams
House, it's no longer there!
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, he takes walkers up a side street for a brief visit
to the legendary Brattle Book Store, then to Boston Common, where
he notes that in his day puritanical types often covered up the
tops of the topless sculptures in the Common fountain. He heads for
that Charles Bulfinch masterpiece, the gold-crowned State House,
along the way pointing out historic buildings and monuments and
branding an amphibious Boston Duck Tours vehicle ``funny looking.''
</P>
<P>
   At the State House, he acknowledges that his statement as
governor during the 1919 Boston police strike _ ``There is no right
to strike against the public safety, by anyone, any time, any
place'' _ propelled him to national prominence. He also tells how
his driver, a state trooper, wanted to take him places with the car
lights flashing and the siren blaring. No, said Coolidge; instead
the trooper should be the first Massachusetts driver to obey the
law _ a statement that shows some things never change.
</P>
<P>
   Scollay Square _ once a haven for burlesque, bars, and goodness
knows what else _ has certainly changed, though. Eyeing the
buildings that dominate the square now known as Government Center,
the Coolidge character comments, ``Doesn't look at all familiar.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more stops, including the Suffolk County Court House
(``No, I don't recall a lawyer named Ally McBeal'') and King's
Chapel Burying Ground, where an ancestor of Coolidge's vice
president, the patriot Charles G. Dawes, is buried. And then it's
off to the Parker House, a haven for generations of politicians,
for a fulsome lunch, complete with Parker House rolls and Boston
creme pie.
</P>
<P>
   Coolidge has done a lot of talking these past three hours. So,
he is asked, what does he think of the moniker Silent Cal? The
reply:
</P>
<P>
   ``Nevah did me any hahhm.''
</P>
<P>
   (The Coolidge tour, which is presented by Historic Boston Walks,
takes place Tuesdays. On Wednesdays, Ben Franklin, played by Bill
Meikle, conducts a ``Seedbed of Rebellion'' walk, and on Fridays,
Abigail Adams, portrayed by Linda Myer, offers the women's
perspective in an ``Eyewitness to the Revolution'' walk. Lunch with
Franklin or Adams is at Le Maison Robert. And on Thursdays,
beginning Aug. 3, Myer will play Sophie Tucker in a walk through
Boston's Jazz Age in 1928, with lunch in a North End restaurant.
All tours begin at 9:30 a.m. and cost $39, including lunch, taxes,
and tips. For more information or reservations, call

Travel Trivia: Which state has a one-word motto, and what is it?
(Answer at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: Soweto in South Africa was derived from South West
Township. (With thanks to faithful contributor Mike Schuster of
Foxborough, Mass.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``If an ass goes traveling, he will not come home a
horse'' _ Thomas Fuller, English physician and writer. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel bookshelf: One of several projects of the not-for-profit
Boston History Collaborative is a literary trail, launched last
year. In addition to available tours (visit www.lit-trail.org), a
guidebook, ``Literary Trail of Greater Boston'' by Susan Wilson
(Houghton Mifflin, $10, paperback) tells you the best ways to
traverse the lush literary landscape of Boston, Cambridge, and
Concord, where so many authors lived and stories were set. The book
is also sprinkled with quotes such as this one from ``The Late
George Apley'' by J.P. Marquand: ``Marriage . . . is a damnably
serious business, particularly around Boston.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Advice to go: If you're taking the family pet on your driving
vacation (or anywhere else), here's a reminder from Sherpa's Pet
Trading Co.: Never leave a pet alone in a car if the temperature is
above 75 degrees. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Now that's luxury: Manhattan by helicopter and Connecticut by Rolls
Royce are two impressive features of a four-night ``Town &AMP;
Country'' package at the Four Seasons Pierre Hotel in New York City
and the Mayflower Inn in Connecticut's Litchfield County, both luxe
properties. The package begins with a chauffeured ride from
LaGuardia, Newark, or Kennedy airport to the Pierre and a guest
room or suite overlooking Central Park or the skyline. A personal
guide will then provide a daylong, customized tour of the city. The
next day, a vintage Rolls Royce takes the guests to the rustically
romantic Mayflower, and a room or suite with a fireplace and an
outdoor balcony. The following day, it's a tour with a private
guide of the area's many antiques shops. And the next afternoon, a
private helicopter returns the guests to their New York area
airport. Such pampering carries a price: $7,860 for two people in a
guest room or $9,220 for a suite. For more information, call the
Pierre at 212-838-8000. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? Rhode Island. The motto is ``Hope.''

 VALLETTA, Malta: ... Malta Harbor.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A must-see for tourists interested in Malta's colorful history
is the documentary,``The Malta Experience,'' shown in Valletta in a
building once used as a hospital by the Knights.
</P>
<P>
   Valletta, the city, should be experienced on foot. Malta's
walled capital sits on a rocky promontory between two deep harbors
and overlooks Fort St. Angelo and Fort St. Elmo, built by the
Knights against the Turkish armada. The Knights created Valletta in
the 16th century and named it for Jean de La Valette, who was
grandmaster of the order at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Valletta's hilly streets leading down to the harbor and its
secret gardens bring San Francisco to mind. This is the seat of
parliament, where, our SMS guide John Zammit-Dimech told us, the
National Party has 35 members and the Labor Party, 30.
</P>
<P>
   Valletta also has the University of Malta and Errol Flynn's old
yacht, ``The Black Pearl,'' is moored in its harbor.
</P>
<P>
   My first visit to Valletta was on a blustery, rainy Sunday with
Agnes Spiteri, a knowledgeble SMS tour guide who once lived in the
States.
</P>
<P>
   Renato, the driver, took us along Marsamxetto Harbour to St.
John's Co-Cathedral, built by the Knights in 1573 and where, that
Sunday, Mass was being televised live by Italian television.
Malta's main and only other cathedral is in the old capital of
Mdina.
</P>
<P>
   The 16th-century cathedral is so beautiful we decided to stay
through Mass and Agnes told me about the tombs of 400 Knights under
marble slabs with their coats of arms set in St. John's marble
floors.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the order's eight auberges, or groups from the various
countries, that made up the Knights have their own chapel. Among
the cathedral's art works are two canvases by Michelangelo Merisi,
known as Caraveggio.
</P>
<P>
   Renato then drove us to Mdina where I followed the indefatigable
Agnes through the driving rain into St. Paul's Catacombs, an
underground Christian burial ground dating to the fourth and fifth
centuries, groping my way down a flight of stone steps through
narrow limestone passages, lit by oil lamps, where tombs were cut
into the rock.
</P>
<P>
   The rain made much more sightseeing in Mdina impossible, but I
was content to learn more in the car from Agnes about how
present-day Maltese live. She told me about the religious
`'festas'' that are regularly held in most Maltese towns and
villages in this predominantly Catholic country to honor their
patron saints. There are fireworks displays, the streets are
festooned with banners and flowers, and the statues are carried,
much like at the religious festivals in Boston's North End.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't leave Malta without visiting Gozo, Malta's smaller of
its two main islands, and a 30-minute boat trip across Gozo Channel
on a boat very much like the Nantucket ferry.
</P>
<P>
   On Gozo, which is one-third the size of the main island, there
are the megalithic temples of Ggantija, which were built of local
limestone around 3600 BC, earlier, it is said, than the first
pyramid in Egypt and Stonehenge in England.
</P>
<P>
   I went on a bus tour of Gozo with Tony Piccinino, a guide for
SMS tours. Because my time was limited, I signed on with the only
tour available, for German-speaking tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Tony, who is fluent not only in Maltese and English, but
also in German, I couldn't understand a word but Tony obliged with
an English version of the tour during breaks.
</P>
<P>
   When I told Tony I was from Boston, his face lit up and he asked
me if I knew Jay Leno. I told him I didn't and asked how he knew
him. ``We get everything on television in Malta,'' said Tony, a
former teacher who worked around the world for oil companies.
``That includes NBC and I watch Jay every night.'' He proved that
by reciting some of Leno's jokes.
</P>
<P>
   The Stone Age Ggantija temples are stunning and are considered
to be the oldest free-standing monuments in the world. Local legend
says that a female giant named Sunsana carried the gigantic rocks
on her head from a great distance so the temples could be built. A
more logical version is that they were moved to the site on stone
rollers.
</P>
<P>
   In Gozo's capital of Victoria, also known as Rabat, we climbed
the ramparts of the Citadel, built in medieval times and
re-fortified by the Knights and visited the cathedral in the square
of the citadel. The cathedral is dedicated to the Assumption of Our
Lady.'' It was demolished in an earthquake in 1693 and rebuilt four
years later. A ``false dome'' (a trompe l'oeil) was painted by
Antonio Manuele from Messina, Italy, and conveys the same effect.
</P>
<P>
   We also visited a shop where women were making and selling the
lace items for which Gozo is famous. In Gozo, we stopped at Dwejra
to get into small launches (for a mere $2) for a spectacular ride
through the ``Azure Window,'' a limestone grotto into the electric
blue waters of the Inland Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the brevity of my stay in Malta, I was unable to
visit the many other prehistoric temples. At some of the sites
there are statues representing the Goddess of Fertility, the
so-called ``fat ladies,'' were discovered in archeological digs.
Some of the statues are in a squatting position; others standing.
They are carved out of globigerina limestone, terra cotta and
alabaster.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I had to leave Malta before hearing any of the
``fat ladies'' sing.

SIDEBAR &QL; 
 &QL; 
The History of Malta, according to the Web site of the Malta
Tourism Authority and others. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Maltese archipelago consists of three islands: Malta, Gozo
and Comino, the last inhabited by only a few farmers. (There are
also two uninhabited islets named Cominotto and Filfla).
</P>
<P>
   The earliest signs of human activity in Malta date back to the
Neolithic Period of about 4000 B.C. Evidence of the existence of
the New Stone Age Man was found at Ghar Dalam, a cave near
Birzebbuga in the south of Malta. Here, archeologists also
discovered the remains of animals from previous eras including
deer, hippopotami and dwarf elephants. These are remnants from the
time when Malta formed part of the land mass which connected
modern-day Europe with the African continent. Subsequent
colonizations brought a race of temple-builders, possibly from
nearby Sicily.
</P>
<P>
   The Aghlabid Arabs from North Africa started to raid the Maltese
archipelago as early as 836 A.D., but were repelled by the
Byzantines. However, a year later, they sent their fleet from
nearby Sicily and managed to overwhelm the Christian defenders.
</P>
<P>
   The Arabs held Malta for over two centuries during which the
island prospered as the new rulers introduced improved systems of
agriculture and irrigation and new produce such as cotton and
citrus fruit. However, the principal legacy of the Arab domination
of Malta is the Maltese lnguage itself which in its roots is
closely akin to Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   Arab sovereignty over Malta ended with the Norman invasion and
conquest of the islands in 1090, although their influence remained
essentially unrestricted until they were finally expelled in the
early years of the 13th century.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Norman'' period was rather short-lived and was followed by
an era of uncertainty as Malta passed through a rapid succession of
rulers; the Swabians (Germans), the Angevins (French) and the
Aragonese (Spanish).
</P>
<P>
   In 1530, the King of Spain, Emperor Charles V, granted the
islands on fief to the International Order of the Knights of St.
John of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The Knights administered the islands for 268 years until 1798,
when Napoleon Bonaparte drove them out and occupied the country in
the name of the French Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Following a brief occupation, the French were forced to
surrender after two years of a land and sea blockade by combined
British and Maltese forces, and in 1800, Malta became a part of the
British Empire.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, Malta attained its indepndence and 10 years laer, in
1974, it was declared a Republic within the Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1960s, the Maltese economy depended mostly on the
British services and the Naval Dockyard. After independence,
industry and tourism advanced at a fast pace and at present Malta
and Gozo have established a good industrial base and flourishing
tourist enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The people speak their own tongue - Maltese, a language of
Semitic origin. Through the ages, many foreign words, particularly
Italian, became part of the language, and Maltese is the only
Semitic language written in Latin characters.

WHERE'S THE HARM IN HARRY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mere Muggle that I am _ that's Potter-speak for a mortal
untouched by magic _ I wouldn't know the difference between
Quidditch and Crookshanks, or Lord Voldemort and Rubeus Hagrid.
I've never entered the enchanted world of Harry Potter, the British
boy wizard and hero of four phenomenonally successful novels by J.
K. Rowling, although I'm starting to feel like one of the few
people who haven't. The first three books have sold a whopping 31
million copies worldwide, and the latest installment, ``Harry
Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' received an unprecedented first
printing of nearly 4 million books, many of which were quickly
snapped up when the title was released last week.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first book, ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,''
was published a few years ago, the series has been all the rage
among children (and a good many adults), and praised by literary
critics and educators for introducing a generation of kids weaned
on video games and MTV to the eternal joys of reading.
</P>
<P>
   And it's all unfolded without the usual accompaniment of
McDonald's action figures and such. (That will come next year, when
the first Harry Potter movie is released. Warner Bros., which owns
the rights, has already secured nearly 50 licensing deals.)
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that _ millions of kids giddy about a series of books!
The notion of kids begging Mom or Dad to stay up past their
bedtimes so they can finish a chapter, or spending their lunch
hours debating the merits of ``Harry Potter and the Chamber of
Secrets'' vs. ``Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,'' isn't
just heartwarming, it's miraculous.
</P>
<P>
   So for the life of me, I can't understand why some folks are
insisting the books be banned, denouncing them as dangerous and
detrimental to kids.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to some conservative Christians _ I refuse to call them
fundamentalists because there's absolutely nothing fun about these
people _ the Harry Potter series topped last year's American
Library Association list of the most-challenged books. Several
school districts have restricted access to the books. In Zeeland,
Mich., elementary and middle-school students could check the books
out of their school library only if they had a permission slip from
their parents. Zeeland superintendent Gary Feenstra also banned
reading the books aloud in classrooms. (A 14-member panel of
teachers and parents eventually overturned Feenstra's edict,
although the books are still forbidden in classrooms.)
</P>
<P>
   And the culture police were all over television this past
weekend, with their stern faces and narrow minds, yammering about
how the books could lead to devil worship, murder, even a repeat of
the Columbine tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we expose our kids to the occult, we expose our kids to
blood, to violence, we desensitize them to that,'' said the Rev.
Lori Schepers, identified on CNN as a ``troubled youth counselor.''
``What I can expect is those kids, as they mature, have a very good
chance of becoming another Dylan Klebold and those guys in
Columbine.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more absurd was Fletcher Brothers, a pastor and founder of
something called Freedom Village USA. He argued that because the
books deal with witchcraft, and witchcraft is recognized by some as
a religion _ well, I'll just let him say it:
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a religion here, and for 37 years we have lived
under this myth of the separation of church and state. And,
therefore, religion does not belong in the classroom,'' Brothers
said. ``Any pastor, any person involved in Christian work can tell
you, (anyone) who's ever tried to do anything with the public
schools, most administrators would agree that the bottom line is,
if it's religious, it cannot be in our schools.''
</P>
<P>
   He later lamented, ``We have more kids that know more about
Harry Potter than they know about Jesus Christ.'' Wow _ first the
Beatles, now Harry Potter. What's a savior gotta do to get some
respect these days?
</P>
<P>
   First of all, if Christianity has survived the lion's den and
televangelists, and Pat Buchanan, I can't imagine it being torn
asunder by a fictional wizard, and his world of hobgoblins, flying
brooms, and vengeful lords. In fact, there's never been any
indication that the books have anything at all to do with any
religion, let alone promoting one while underminding another.
</P>
<P>
   As for the violence, yes, the books can be bloody and scary.
But, I would imagine, no more so than children's fairy tales like
``Little Red Riding Hood,'' literary classics like ``The Lord of
the Rings,'' and, yes, the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   At their core, the Potter books are about good triumphing over
evil, about an orphaned child raised by cruel, uncaring relatives
who discovers that he is, in fact, quite special. Where's the
danger in that? Instead of harming children, the Potter books open
to them worlds of adventure, possibility, and, most important, a
world of words that fire up young imaginations more than any movie
or action figure could.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the success of the Harry Potter books is something
to be celebrated, not condemned. And any myopic talk accusing the
books of being anti-Christian tools of the devil, or enemies of the
Constitution, is _ to use a bit of Potter-speak _ a crock of
codswallop.

LEGAL LEGERDEMAIN AND THE MAKING OF FOXWOODS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
WITHOUT RESERVATION 
The Making of America's Most Powerful Indian Tribe and Foxwoods,
the World's Largest Casino 
By Jeff Benedict 
HarperCollins, 376 pp., $26 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite what the title might suggest, the story Jeff Benedict
tells in ``Without Reservation'' is not an inspiring account of how
a small band of impoverished Native Americans pulled themselves up
by their own moccasin strings.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he claims, the Mashantucket Pequots of Ledyard, Conn.,
got to be owners of the billion-dollar-a-year money machine that is
Foxwoods casino thanks to a couple of legal fast shuffles by their
leaders and lawyers. The big losers, he says, were Congress, the
State of Connecticut, and local landowners whose property the tribe
snapped up at bargain prices with taxpayers' money. And besides,
Benedict maintains, the Mashantucket Pequots aren't even an
authentic Indian tribe and should never have been allowed to open a
casino in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   For all its nonfiction importance, the book is written in a
florid, novelistic style that is more annoying than effective.
Excess verbiage often obscures important points, and lack of an
index and time line contributes to the confusion.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a lot of suspiciously precise detail about
long-past events. Twenty-five-year-old conversations are recalled
word for word, for example, and Benedict always seems to know what
the weather was on a given day, the color of socks or shirts people
wore, and even what they were thinking at key moments.
</P>
<P>
   How they did it may be in dispute, but it's a fact that no
American Indian tribe has come so far so fast as the Mashantucket
Pequots. Today, the tribe has more than 600 members (all of whom
are cut in on the casino action) living on a reservation of
2,000-plus acres. Not so many years ago there was only one
acknowleged Pequot: an elderly woman named Elizabeth George, who
lived by herself in a ramshackle house on a reservation of 214
acres. When George died of a heart attack at 78, in 1973, the
reservation was abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later George's grandson, Richard ``Skip'' Hayward,
reorganized the tribe after being contacted by Tom Tureen, a
Maine-based lawyer specializing in Indian rights. Under Hayward's
leadership, the Pequots brought a suit seeking land, a cash
settlement, and federal recognition as a tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Federal recognition _ which not incidentally brings with it the
right to operate a casino _ is usually granted by the Bureau of
Indian Affairs. As Benedict tells the story, Tureen's brilliant
legal maneuvering enabled the Pequots to sidestep the rigorous BIA
recognition process. As part of a 1983 settlement, the tribe was
federally recognized by act of Congress, something rarely done.
</P>
<P>
   Federal recognition guidelines require among other things that a
tribe have a long-standing organization, preserve Native American
culture and traditions, and be in continuous occupation of any land
claimed. The long-scattered and much-intermarried Pequots could
meet none of these standards, in Benedict's opinion. He also
asserts that genealogical records show that Elizabeth George _
supposedly the link to the original Pequot tribe _ was not a Pequot
at all but descended from the Narragansett tribe of Rhode Island.
Congress might also have acted differently, according to Benedict,
had the Pequots not concealed their intentions to start gaming
operations on their reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Money can't buy harmony, and Benedict reports that the
Mashantucket Pequots are now a deeply divided tribe. Although still
very large, their casino revenues are declining, and the tribe has
amassed considerable debt because of what Benedict describes as
lavish spending and poor supervision. The tribe is also now
bitterly split between those members who had previously identified
themselves as Caucasians and others who had been considered
African-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Reservation'' has been denounced by tribal leaders,
who declined to cooperate with Benedict while he was researching
it. However, there have also been calls for a congressional
investigation that could lead to revocation of the tribe's federal
status. The odds of that happening are long, but the odds don't
always favor the house.

&HT;     HOW TO DRESS WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT THE EXTRA POUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Whether she's a petite or a 3X, when a woman
tries on clothes and peeks at herself in a three-way mirror, she
always asks: ``Does this make me look fat?''
</P>
<P>
   You don't hear guys discussing their posteriors in a new pair of
Dockers (unless it's a parody ad), and you certainly don't hear
them voicing too much concern that maybe they have THO (Tummy
Hang-Over) from too many slices of pizza and Bud. So . . . this is
truly a girl thing. Much to our chagrin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does This Make Me Look Fat?'' is also the title of clothing
consultant and ``Today Show'' contributor Leah Feldon's latest
book. She has subtitled it: ``The definitive rules for dressing
thin for every height, size and shape.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Women say this all the time, and men don't because women have
many more curves than men have,'' Feldon said. ``Men are flat
chested, and dressing well is a matter of proportion to them. Plus,
they don't have to deal with hemlines. They wear pants _ basically
a uniform _ and they deal with very few variations. Most women wear
totally different looks all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   And not all of them are flattering.
</P>
<P>
   Feldon, a petite, dark, leggy woman with a gamine face and a
bubbly manner, is the kind of woman other women envy. She is
slender and stylish, given to black clothes and good gold jewelry.
In other words, she's very New York fashionista, mitigated by the
fact that she lives with her songwriter husband in Nashville,
Tenn., most of the time, where, she groans, ``there is absolutely
no place to shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Shopping used to be her career, especially in the 1970s and
1980s when she styled shoots for television and print advertising,
including Revlon, Clairol, Monet jewelry and Black Velvet whiskey.
Burned out with New York, she headed to Florida, where she
co-hosted ``PM Magazine'' in Jacksonville. But before long she
moved to the West Coast, while still writing for People magazine
and appearing on the ``Today Show'' with Jane Pauley and Tom
Brokaw. Her first book was ``Woman Style,'' which, she says,
``explained the nitty-gritty of color, line, texture, design and
composition,'' the very things she was taught as an art history
major in college.
</P>
<P>
   So she's heard that particular question: ``Does this make me
look fat?'' enough times to call it ``the universal fashion
question. I figure: Why would anyone want to look heavier?'' she
says laughing.
</P>
<P>
   The book is detailed and covers topics from ``the Ten Top
Reasons for Camouflage Chic'' to ``The Most Common Mistakes We
Women Make'' (which include following fads; not finding a
``uniform'' or a specific set of clothes that will take you
everywhere; choosing quantity over quality; and how to tame the
chaos of an unorganized closet _ else how do you know what you
already own?). But to hone it down to it simplest outlines, I asked
Feldon to give Five Rules of Thumb for thinning fashion tips
dressing thin that work for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   _ Go monochromatic. A dark, one-color silhouette always makes
you look a lot thinner than you are. And, she said, you can always
add a color accent like a great pin or a scarf.
</P>
<P>
   _ The vertical thing. ``Look for vertical lines in design,''
Feldon said, ``with longer, smaller lapels which will bring the eye
up and down. No double-breasted coats.'' She also warned: No
horizontal stripes if you're hippy and no belts to break up the
line of a longish jacket if you're short waisted.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make it fit. Forget sizes, Feldon said. Buy what fits. She
said the clothes in her closet vary from size 4 to size 8. ``Even
within some brands, clothes will fit differently.'' The point is:
``You don't have to look like you're wearing somebody else's
clothes. If it's too big, it'll make you look fat.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Camouflage. Accentuation of the positive and visually
eliminating the negative sounds very pat, but it works. For
instance, if you have what Feldon calls ``thunder thighs,'' avoid
Spandex pants and Bermuda shorts. If your upper arms tend to be
heavy, avoid sleeveless dresses or dresses where a sleeve hits you
at the chubbiest part. ``Throw a chiffon scarf over your arms and
shoulders,'' Feldon said. The point here is looking in the mirror
and being very truthful with yourself as to your figure's assets
and debits and dress them accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Accessorize. ``You know how the wrong shoes can absolutely
ruin an outfit,'' Feldon said, ``like wearing clunky shoes with
chiffon. . . . Chunky heels on sandals look awful from the back.
They make a heavy leg look heavier and a slim woman look
ungraceful. I'm still into elegance and grace _ which won't go out
of style any time soon.''

</P>
<P>
   PARIS-BISTOS (Paris) _ The word bistro is used as promiscuously
in Paris as the word deli is used in New York. Bistros in the true
sense _ the name comes from a Russian word meaning quick _ were
riding high when I first ate my merry way around the French capital
in the 1960s. Happily, Paris is a conservative city, slow-changing
and resistant to ``progress,'' and quite a few of the genuine
articles survive. Lovers of the sturdy, copious, grandmotherly
cooking that marks a true bistro pass favorite addresses from hand
to hand, like Russians in the Communist era exchanging samizdat
manuscripts. The guidebooks may forget, but die-hard bistro owners
and clients, Frenchmen and foreigners alike, tend the flame. By

&HT;     CONTRACEPTIVE SPONGE MAY RETURN TO THE MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RICHARD A. MARINI  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Today contraceptive sponge, immortalized in an episode of
the television show ``Seinfeld'' and unavailable since 1995, may
soon be back on drugstore shelves if it clears a few remaining
regulatory hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced in 1983, the Today Vaginal Contraceptive Sponge was
easy to use, available without a prescription and could be left in
place for up to 24 hours and through multiple acts of intercourse.
The soft, polyurethane foam device acted as a physical barrier
between sperm and the cervix and also contained the spermicide
nonoxynol-9.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, Today was the best-selling over-the-counter female
contraceptive device on the market, selling 250 million sponges by
the time its manufacturer, Whitehall-Robins Healthcare, voluntarily
removed it from the market in January 1995. While there were never
any serious questions about the safety and efficacy of the device,
the company decided it would be too expensive and time-consuming to
make government-mandated upgrades to its manufacturing plant in
Hammonton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time we determined it would take 36 months to get the
product back on the market,'' said Fran Sullivan, a spokeswoman for
the Madison, N.J.-based company. ``By then, too many consumers
would have switched to other contraceptive devices.''
</P>
<P>
   In what has become a classic ``Seinfeld,'' the character Elaine
is so distraught that Today is being taken off the market that she
decides to use her dwindling supply only with men lucky enough to
be deemed ``spongeworthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Allendale Pharmaceuticals Inc. recently purchased the rights to
the Today sponge, including the name and manufacturing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm astounded by the awareness of this product,'' said Gene
Detroyer, president and chief executive of the Allentown, Pa.-based
company.
</P>
<P>
   The company originally announced it would begin marketing the
sponge by late spring or mid-summer. But according to Detroyer, the
Food and Drug Administration, which regulates contraceptive
devices, has cancelled two scheduled plant inspections necessary
for final approval. And the FDA's non-prescription drug advisory
committee has also scheduled a hearing for Wednesday to discuss the
re-marketing and labeling of the product.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Staab, chairman and chief scientific officer of the
company, said he is puzzled by the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sponge was approved back in the early '80s and the science
behind it hasn't changed. I think it's just a matter of some
well-intentioned bureaucrats who want to make sure the product is
reviewed as thoroughly as it possibly can be.''
</P>
<P>
   He also expressed concern that the advisory committee will
recommend labeling changes that may confuse users by misstating the
sponge's pregnancy prevention rate. Most, but not all, peg it at 80
percent to 90 percent. Failure of the device is largely blamed on
misuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The act of lovemaking is a very personal matter,'' he said.
``And each couple must choose the contraceptive method that's best
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The advisory committee can either recommend approval of the
labeling as is, or suggest changes. Advisory committee
recommendations are usually accepted by the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   While applauding another birth control option, Jeffrey Hons,
head of the San Antonio office of Planned Parenthood, said he did
not expect the Today sponge to greatly shake up the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be one of a number of over-the-counter contraceptives
available, but I don't see it being more popular than the birth
control pill or sterilization for women, or the condom for men.''
</P>
<P>
   Hons also warned that the sponge will stop the spread of
sexually transmitted disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Today sponge has already been approved for sale in Canada
and should be available there in the coming weeks. In the United
States, it is expected to sell for about $2 per sponge and come in
packages of three, six and 12 sponges.

   ISRAEL-GRASSROOTS _ JERUSALEM _ Right-wing Israelis are taking
to the streets to save, as they see it, their land and homes.
Left-wingers turned out Tuesday night to save their prime minister.
Still traumatized by the 1995 assassination of peace-making Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin, some left-wing Israelis vow they will show
more support for a peacemaker this time. Some feel their silence in
1995 helped create the atmosphere for Rabin's death and they don't
want to repeat the mistake. The battle for the grassroots is under
way and even Ehud Barak, while meeting in Camp David, will be
keeping an eye on public opinion polls back home. (Kaplow, Copx

TIPPER GORE MARCHES TO HER OWN BEAT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and p coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ She was being introduced as a woman now
facing the ``greatest challenge'' of helping her husband become the
next president.
</P>
<P>
   Just then _ with the July sun gleaming on Tipper Gore's plum
pant suit, in a garden full of Democrats invited to this luncheon
fund-raiser by New Republic owner Martin Peretz and his wife, Anne
_ a beeper went off.
</P>
<P>
   Distracted by the sound, her eyes darted about the lush lawn,
the talk of Al Gore as the next president not enough to keep her
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   The Gores have four children. Three of them, she notes sharply,
are ``not Karenna,'' the couple's oldest daughter who has become a
lightning rod in her father's campaign and whose short list of
accomplishments includes moving the headquarters from Washington to
Nashville and dressing Dad in earth tones (on the advice of her
friend feminist author Naomi Wolf).
</P>
<P>
   She also has a grandson _ Karenna's 1-year-old, Wyatt _ and an
elderly mother who lives in the vice presidential home. Then
there's Al's mother, approaching 90 and clinging to the farm in
Tennessee, where she needs constant care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign is something that's happening in my life right
now,'' Tipper said in an interview Friday over tea and cookies in
the Peretz's art-filled living room. ``The campaign is not my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   She seems to mean it. She looks you in the eye, taps your hand
for emphasis, and directs the photographer to the best spot of
light in the room for taking her picture, because, you see, Tipper
is a serious photographer, with some of her work included in an
exhibit on homelessness that will be opening at the Los Angeles
Public Library during the Democratic convention in that city next
month. She uses a Nikon. And hates digital processing.
</P>
<P>
   Without saying it in a way that may insult the campaign, this is
how Tipper makes it clear that she has her own identity. That her
other interests are kept separate from the politics, even as the
pundits are proclaiming she could be her husband's greatest asset
by connecting with voters on the campaign trail _ if only she'd
seek the limelight more.
</P>
<P>
   Especially because women will decide the outcome of the 2000
election. Especially because 26-year-old Karenna is one of the
flashpoints of the turmoil within Al Gore's campaign, now under its
third leadership team since chairman Tony Coelho stepped down last
month, citing his health.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of holding rallies on, say, the importance of
choosing Supreme Court justices who will uphold abortion rights,
Tipper spent some of last Friday under a pink tent at the Peretz's,
whom the Gores have known since the vice president took a class
from Martin Peretz as an undergraduate at Harvard 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support my husband and I love him. . .but that's not _ I
sound like Lily Tomlin _ all of me. . ..We are a living family.
Evolving. We're big,'' she said simply. ``At the same time, each of
us has our lives to live. I'm not the person who's running.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike her husband, she's surprisingly unguarded, and her
answers, particularly to political questions, often meander to
other subjects. And she is no stranger to the artful dodge,
especially whenever the names of Hillary Clinton or Laura Bush, her
fellow potential First Lady, are brought up.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she comes off as a warm, approachable person, with people
skills that are somewhat akin to Bill Clinton's, but with a softer
handshake and public voice. And she shares his love for music.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked in her purse was a harmonica that her saxophone-playing
daughter Sarah presented to her as a Christmas gift because it's a
portable instrument. Her full set of Pearl drums _ along with some
congas and bongos _ don't travel much, but she gets around with
them, having played with the Greatful Dead and, most recently, at
Washington's RFK stadium ``in front of 43,000 people!'' with
Melissa Etheridge, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just feel like we're regular people in extraordinary
circumstances,'' she says, yet she concertedly avoids follow-up
questions that pertain to the campaign, and her life after the
election. Drumming, it seems, is what Tipper wants to talk about,
and the subject brings her to the edge of the upholstered armchair.
</P>
<P>
   Music, she says, helps people find their voice. Proudly, she
recalls how she taught herself to play the drums at age 12, when an
ad hoc group of musical friends needed someone to keep time.
Fortunately, she notes, her mother allowed the noisy pursuit, which
her own son Albert Jr., who still lives at home, has also embraced.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, she played drums on an original CD single called
``When the Ball Drops,'' a a cheeky teen-age ditty about finding
the right person to kiss on New Year's Eve. The campaigner in her
laughs, just thinking about the frivolity of the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Despite having experienced elections before, she won't talk
about November and what she and her husband will do, win or lose,
because ``it's superstitious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have daydreams about living in the White House,'' she
says softly. ``That would be unhealthy.''

 &HT;    EPA OFFERS SCHOOLS 'SUNWISE' PROGRAM TO CUT SKIN CANCER RISK
 &HT;    By ROB O'DELL
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government and local schools are
teaming up to teach children about the dangers of sun exposure.
</P>
<P>
   The SunWise program, offered by the Environmental Protection
Agency, is designed to provide schools a free and easy way to teach
children how to protect themselves from overexposure to the sun and
how to develop sun-safe behaviors, said Linda Rutsch, the program's
schools coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run, the SunWise program hopes to reduce instances
of skin cancer, but for now we want to educate children about the
harmful effects of the sun,'' Rutsch said. ``Because the majority
of a person's exposure to the sun occurs during youth, now it is a
critical time to get the message to young people.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joel Wilentz, a dermatologist from Hallandale, Fla., said
although adults are often warned about the dangers of the sun,
children are often allowed to play in the sun unprotected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The skin never forgets it exposure to the sun,'' Wilentz said.
``One bad sunburn during childhood doubles the chance of getting
skin cancer later in life.''
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that 80 percent of a person's lifetime exposure
to the sun occurs before the age of 18, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The SunWise program provides its partner schools with classroom
lessons and background information for kindergarten through eighth
grade. The program teaches children about sunscreen, use of proper
clothing, and limiting exposure to the sun at the times when it is
strongest, Rutsch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The SunWise program is designed to provide maximum
flexibility, because the program can be used as stand-alone
teaching tools or to complement existing school curricula,'' Rutsch
said. ``The time commitment necessary to implement SunWise is
minimal, but the potential payoff in lower skin cancer rates is
very high.''
</P>
<P>
   The program also includes information about sun exposure through
the EPA's Web site, and allows students to study daily measurements
of ultraviolet radiation, Rutsch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through the site, the students can study daily UV data,
weather conditions, and daily sun-protection practices,'' Rutsch
said. ``The students can study the UV index on the National Weather
Service's Web site, and measure the amount of UV by using hand-held
monitoring devices that are loaned to the schools by the SunWise
program.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 schools are participating in the SunWise program
nationwide. Schools, individual classrooms or entire school
districts can register either on line or by sending a registration
form to the EPA.

   NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas _ A Corpus Christi couple exchanged ``I
do's'' Monday over the bleating of goats and screeching of macaws
at the Snake Farm 30 miles north of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't a traditional wedding, with flowing dresses,
pristine pews and an altar bedecked with flowers. Instead, guests
congregated at picnic tables under a shelter, while Michael
Stockton, 23, slipped a ring on the finger of Danita Palmer, 18.
Rubber snakes dangled from the rafters. Palmer's long white dress
skimmed the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   And, just feet away were a host of unusual witnesses: baboons
and bats and bearded dragons, chickens and a chuckawala lizard,
ostriches and iguanas, an emu and a snapping turtle.
</P>
<P>
   Also: Hissing cockroaches crawling in a nearby aquarium, the
calico cat wandering underfoot, or the diamondback rattlesnakes
slithering in a snake pit.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unusual setting for a matrimonial exchange, but for
Palmer and Stockton, a fitting one.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both just crazy about reptiles,'' said Palmer's
mother, Mona. ``She works at a pet shop. He works at the Humane
Society.''
</P>
<P>
   And together, they own more than 10 of the creatures, including
an Indian Python and a legless lizard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a zoo over there,'' said Mona Palmer, who doesn't
share her daughter's appreciation for all things slithering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once, she told me, she was playing with the snake and fell
asleep. When she woke up, the snake had slid under her shirt,''
Palmer said, shuddering. ``Eww.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockton has traded snakes with Snake Farm owner John Mellyn
since Mellyn took over the roadside attraction six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always came up to the Snake Farm. We love this place,''
said Graham Criglow, one of Stockton's friends. ``We're not normal
people. This is what we enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be great,'' Mellyn said. ``After all ...
people like to get married on roller coasters these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is a first for the tourist hot spot along Interstate
35. Although it has been luring school groups and picnickers for
more than 30 years, the Snake Farm has never been a draw for
brides-to-be.

   PARIS-BISTOS (Paris) _ The word bistro is used as promiscuously
in Paris as the word deli is used in New York. Bistros in the true
sense _ the name comes from a Russian word meaning quick _ were
riding high when I first ate my merry way around the French capital
in the 1960s. Happily, Paris is a conservative city, slow-changing
and resistant to ``progress,'' and quite a few of the genuine
articles survive. Lovers of the sturdy, copious, grandmotherly
cooking that marks a true bistro pass favorite addresses from hand
to hand, like Russians in the Communist era exchanging samizdat
manuscripts. The guidebooks may forget, but die-hard bistro owners
and clients, Frenchmen and foreigners alike, tend the flame. By

&HT;     COURT CLEARS PROFESSOR TO OPPOSE SMOKING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOB EGELKO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A California appellate court says that a leading
critic of the tobacco industry can continue to fight smoking from
his perch as a University of California professor.
</P>
<P>
   An industry-allied group, Californians for Scientific Integrity,
sued the University of California in 1998 over Stanton Glantz's use
of his university job and resources to push for tougher state
action against smoking. The suit contended that Glantz's activities
were a misuse of tax money.
</P>
<P>
   But the 3rd District Court of Appeal said Glantz's activity was
authorized by the Legislature, which has directed the state to
``play a leading role in promoting a smoke-free society by the year
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Glantz, a professor of medicine at UC-San Francisco, was a
founder and former president of Californians for Nonsmokers'
Rights. He has worked for state and local bans on smoking in public
buildings and for stronger messages in state-funded anti-smoking
ads.
</P>
<P>
   His studies on smoking and health have been disputed by tobacco
companies, which have tried to get Congress and the California
Legislature to cut off his government funding. The suit by
Californians for Scientific Integrity initially included a
challenge to the validity of a study by Glantz that found that
prohibitions on smoking in restaurants did not hurt tourism. That
claim was later dropped and the group ultimately sought only to
halt the alleged misuse of state funds for lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were attempting to intimidate me and the university,''
Glantz said Monday. ``The university stood up to the thugs in
cigarette companies again and won again.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark A. Perry, a lawyer for the group that sued the university,
said no decision has been made on a further appeal. He said he
disagreed with the court's conclusion that the general statements
in state law about a smoke-free society authorized Glantz to use
state funds to promote anti-smoking policies.
</P>
<P>
   Perry denied Glantz's assertion that Californians for Scientific
Integrity was a front for the tobacco industry, but said it is
partially funded by the National Smokers' Alliance, which draws
funding from tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate ruling, issued Thursday, upheld a decision by
Sacramento County Superior Court Judge Joe Gray to dismiss the
lawsuit without a trial. The court said California law forbids
certain types of state-funded political activities, such as the use
of state funds to influence election campaigns, but does not
prohibit activity that the Legislature itself has authorized.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of California has taken an unambiguous position
against smoking and tobacco-related diseases'' and has chosen the
university, through research and education, ``to play an integral
part in achieving those goals,'' Justice Fred Morrison said in the
3-0 ruling.

&HT;     VOTERS MAY GET A BREAK FROM USUAL FLURRY OF BALLOT ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JIM HERRON ZAMORA and ILENE LELCHUK  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco is famous for its long ballots,
but so far this year only an initiative limiting political
donations is certain to be voted on in November.
</P>
<P>
   However, supporters of three other initiatives delivered
thousands of signatures to the Department of Elections by Monday's
deadline in the hopes of getting their measures on the ballot.
Voters may also get a chance to create a municipal utility district
to compete with the Pacific Gas and Electric Co.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the three voter initiatives are sponsored by tenant
groups and already have drawn legal challenges from landlords.
</P>
<P>
   The third measure would ban cars on Saturdays from a section of
Golden Gate Park along JFK Drive, already the rule on Sundays.
Sponsored by cyclists and in-line skaters, the measure has not yet
drawn significant opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Supervisors and Mayor Willie Brown each have until
Aug. 9 to add initiatives of their own. So far it is not clear that
they will add anything.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisors Gavin Newsom and Mark Leno have been floating the
idea of a November ballot measure to make it city policy to support
nonprofit education uses for the waterfront over new, glitzy
commercial tourist attractions. The idea comes in negative response
to a proposal, approved by the Port Commission, to create a faux
San Francisco attraction on the waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisors also are deciding whether they can put a measure on
the ballot to create a municipal utility district with an elected
board.
</P>
<P>
   The Coalition for Lower Utility Bills wants voters to have a
city-owned alternative to PG&AMP;E. The group, which turned in 23,400
signatures last week, contends that public utility districts charge
about 23 percent less for electricity than corporations.
</P>
<P>
   But the city attorney's office maintains that the planned voter
initiative would bypass state laws governing the creation of new
utility districts. The Board of Supervisors has taken up the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't get the board to put us on the November ballot,
then we will ask a judge to put us on,'' said Neil Eisenberg, a
supporter of the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The tenants issues have drawn the most controversy.
</P>
<P>
   One would restrict the practice known as ``tenants in common,''
in which unrelated investors form groups to buy duplexes or
apartment buildings and then each participating investor takes a
unit as his or her home. The process takes rentals off the market.
But it often allows renters who could not otherwise afford to buy
real estate to become homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   The other initiative would limit rent increases that landlords
charge tenants to pay for improvements or renovations to a rental
property.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week landlords have filed suits against both
measures, claiming violations of state and federal law. The
landlords will ask judges to keep each initiative off the ballot,
but so far neither suit has been heard in court.
</P>
<P>
   The only initiative already on the ballot is sponsored by the
city's Ethics Commission. Because it was put on the ballot by the
commission, the initiative did not require the signatures of nearly
10,000 registered voters. The measure would create a public
financing scheme in races for the governing Board of Supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, candidates for supervisor would be eligible for
public money if they agree to spending caps: $75,000 in the general
election and $20,000 more for runoffs. They also would have to
raise at least $7,500 on their own in individual amounts under
$100.
</P>
<P>
   Each qualified supervisorial candidate could receive up to
$60,750 in taxpayer money under the plan. The total yearly cost
could not exceed $2 per San Francisco resident. The has nearly
800,000 residents.

THE MAYOR SMELLS A RAT NEAR HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC LIPTON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Citing frequent encounters with rats on his porch at
Gracie Mansion, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced the formation of a
new city task force Monday to examine ways to control the rodent
population in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rats are horrible,'' Giuliani said, recalling the uninvited
visitors to his porch with its East River views during recent
summers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see them, no matter how immune you are to anything or
how brave you think you are, the rats get you really scared. They
can bite you, they can spread disease and they are frightening
animals.''
</P>
<P>
   The creation of the task force comes after reports in recent
weeks of intense rat infestation problems in Queens County and at
the Baruch Houses on the Lower East Side public housing project.
</P>
<P>
   The city, Giuliani said, is looking for new ways to intensify
the battle. City Councilman Bill Perkins, who held a recent hearing
on the problem, said one step could be to appoint a ``rat czar'' to
coordinate how city agencies respond to sightings. Perkins and
Councilman Stephen Fiala have also proposed legislation that would
require developers to exterminate rats before starting construction
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani encouraged city residents not to expect too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unrealistic to think you are not going to have rats,''
the mayor said, before adding, without hesitation, that ``you
should not have as many as we have.''

A NEW LOOK AT REALITIES OF DIVORCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TIERNEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Which sex is mostly to blame for divorce? The answer
seems obvious every time a mogul like Donald Trump or Ronald
Perelman or Rupert Murdoch dumps his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative preachers and liberal feminists are united in their
disdain for philandering men who abandon their children.
Journalists (including this one) and politicians of all persuasions
have righteously condemned ``deadbeat dads.'' Even Hollywood
professes to be appalled at the cads depicted in ``The First Wives
Club.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's a problem with the conventional wisdom. Across
America, at least two-thirds of divorce suits are filed by women.
Researchers who have interviewed divorcing couples have repeatedly
found that, in cases where the divorce is not mutually desired,
women are more than twice as likely to be the ones who want out.
After the split, women are typically happier than their exes.
</P>
<P>
   This trend has inspired what is probably the first paper in the
American Journal of Law and Economics ever to be named after a
Nancy Sinatra song. In ``These Boots Are Made for Walking: Why Most
Divorce Filers Are Women,'' Margaret Brinig and Douglas Allen, both
economists, analyze all 46,000 divorces filed in one year, 1995, in
four different states: Connecticut, Virginia, Montana and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   They looked for different reasons that would prompt a woman to
file for divorce. One would be to escape an abusive husband _ like
a man who is adulterous or violent. But in the state with the best
records of grievances, Virginia, only 6 percent of divorces were
granted on grounds of violence, and husbands were cited for
adultery only slightly more often than wives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some women file for divorce because they're exploited in
really bad marriages,'' said Brinig, a professor of law at the
University of Iowa. ``But it seems to be a relatively small number,
probably less than 20 percent of the cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Another impetus to divorce is the belief that your partner is no
longer good enough for you. The classic example is the guy who
takes a trophy wife after dumping the high-school sweetheart who
sacrificed her own potential to put him through medical school, but
a woman can be similarly tempted to leave a husband who is less
successful than she is.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that the better-educated partner, male or
female, was indeed more likely to file for divorce. But again these
types of divorces seemed to represent less than 20 percent of the
cases.
</P>
<P>
   The solution to the mystery, the factor that determined most
cases, turned out to be the question of child custody. Women are
much more willing to split up because _ unlike men _ they typically
do not fear losing custody of the children. Instead, a divorce
often enables them to gain control over the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question of custody absolutely swamps all the other
variables,'' Brinig said. ``Children are the most important asset
in a marriage, and the partner who expects to get sole custody is
by far the most likely to file for divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   The correlation with custody is so strong, Brinig said, that she
has changed her view about the best way to preserve marriages and
protect children. She previously advocated an end to quick no-fault
divorces, but now believes that the key is to rewrite custody laws.
</P>
<P>
   In most states, mothers can fight for and usually win sole
custody. But some states have recently begun making joint custody
the presumptive norm.
</P>
<P>
   That change in the law seems to be keeping more couples
together, according to this study and other work by Brinig. She and
colleagues have noted a decline in divorce in states with
joint-custody laws. And when couples do divorce, fathers who share
custody are less likely to renege on their child-support payments.
</P>
<P>
   Brinig favors a law like the one recently enacted in West
Virginia, which typically awards each parent a share of custody
according to how much time that parent spent with the child during
the marriage. Besides eliminating some of the vicious court fights
that now take place over custody, she said, such a law could lead
to fewer divorces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Custody is now a way _ in some marriages the only way _ for
women to achieve a real show of force over men,'' Brinig said. ``If
you remove that distortion, it's apt to change the way men and
women relate to each other and to their kids. Fathers are likely to
spend more time with kids if they can expect to still see them if
the marriage doesn't work out. Women will be more likely to see men
as parenting partners, and less likely to use divorce as a power
play.''

   The American painter Ellsworth Kelly, the French sculptor Niki
de Saint Phalle, the British architect Richard Rogers, the German
composer Hans Werner Henze and the American composer and lyricist
Stephen Sondheim are the recipients of the 12th Praemium Imperiale
Awards, presented by the Japan Art Association for outstanding
achievement in the arts. The recipients were announced Tuesday at a
ceremony at the Tate Modern in London.
</P>
<P>
   The five awards, among the largest in the arts with a stipend of
about $140,000 each, are given in areas not covered by the Nobel
Prizes: painting, sculpture, architecture, music, and theater-film.
The prizes will be presented, along with commemorative medals from
the Japanese imperial family, in Tokyo on Oct. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Recipients of the awards are selected each year by the art
association on the recommendations of a board of international
advisers representing Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and
the United States. Past recipients have included the actor John
Gielgud, the painter David Hockney, the architect Frank O. Gehry
and the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich.
</P>
<P>
   The association also presents a grant of about $47,000 to an
organization that supports the development of young artists. This
year's winner is the Ulster Youth Orchestra, which said it planned
to use the award to perform and study in England for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement ceremonies are rotated among the advisers' home
cities. This year's host was Sir Edward Heath, the former British
prime minister, who has been an adviser since the awards began in
1989.

ONION CONFIT FIT FOR TUNA 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK BITTMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cooking onions very slowly brings out amazing flavor,
a rich sweetness. Just by themselves they taste great, but when you
combine them with the liquid exuded by olives and tomatoes, you get
a gloriously juicy base for any fish fillet or steak. With meaty
grilled tuna or swordfish, the onions make an easy summer dish with
a Provencal accent.
</P>
<P>
   Onions cooked this way can be considered a confit, a term that
has been adapted to apply to almost any food that is slow-cooked to
achieve the ultimate in tenderness. A confit often involves lots of
fat, but onions give off so much liquid you need very little, just
a few tablespoons of olive oil. They essentially stew in their own
juices. The only considerations are a low flame and a fair amount
of time, about 30 to 40 minutes. The onions should not brown at
all.
</P>
<P>
   While the onions are cooking, you can finish the rest of the
dish. As the grill is heating for the fish, pit and chop the olives
and dice the tomatoes. I don't bother to skin them; just core them
and shake out most of their seeds before chopping them. Grilling
the fish takes just six minutes if you use tuna, closer to 10
minutes if you choose to overlook the current boycott (based on
possible overfishing) and use swordfish. The fish can be cooked as
individual steaks or in one slab, then cut into serving portions.
</P>
<P>
   Thyme is the perfect herb for the onions, but you can use bay
leaf instead, or you can finish the dish with a handful of chopped
basil, chervil or parsley. If you like, you can also cook some
finely chopped aromatic vegetables, like carrots, celery, fennel
and garlic, along with the onions.
</P>
<P>
   The fish is very straightforward: just seasoned and grilled.
Although I like this dish best with tuna or swordfish, it's almost
as good with grilled boneless chicken breasts, as long as they're
not overcooked.
</P>
<P>
   TUNA OR SWORDFISH WITH ONION CONFIT
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 minutes
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3 large or 4 or 5 medium onions, peeled and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 large thyme sprig or 1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   2 medium tomatoes, cored
</P>
<P>
   1{ to 2 pounds tuna or swordfish, cut into steaks or left whole
</P>
<P>
   About { cup pitted and roughly chopped black olives.
</P>
<P>
   1. Put olive oil in a 10- or 12-inch skillet, and turn heat to
medium. Add onions, a good pinch of salt, pepper and bay leaf or
thyme. Cook, stirring, until mixture starts to sizzle, a minute or
two. Adjust heat so that you need to stir at most only every 5
minutes to keep onions from browning as they soften; do not allow
to brown. Cook at least 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Meanwhile, cut tomatoes in half and shake out seeds, then cut
into {-inch dice. Heat a grill until moderately hot.
</P>
<P>
   3. When onions are very soft, almost a shapeless mass, season
fish and grill, turning once, for a total of about 6 minutes for
tuna, 8 to 10 minutes for swordfish; check for doneness by making a
small cut in center to peek inside. While fish is grilling, stir
olives and tomatoes into onions, and raise heat; cook, stirring
occasionally, until tomatoes liquefy and mixture becomes juicy.
Taste, and adjust seasoning. Serve fish on a bed of onion confit,
whole fish cut into serving portions.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

 STATUE OF `SHE-WOLF' SEPARATED FROM CHILDREN FOR FIRST TIME IN 500
YEARS   By ELISABETTA POVOLEDO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Forcibly separating a mother from her young children is
always heartbreaking. It is even harder when they have been
together 500 years. But that is what has happened here, where a
bronze, ``The She-Wolf'' of the Capitoline Museums, has been
separated from her legendary (and also bronze) children, Romulus
and Remus, for an exhibition celebrating the myth of the founding
of Rome.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, which runs until Oct. 15, inaugurates the
opening of a new area of the Capitoline Museums, renowned for their
collection of ancient Roman sculptures, including ``Dying Gaul,''
the ``Capitoline Venus'' and the ``Resting Faun,'' which inspired
Nathaniel Hawthorne's 19th-century novel ``The Marble Faun.''
Admired by generations of illustrious visitors (the Italian poet
Giovanni Pascoli even wrote odes to their statues), the museums
also have an important collection of paintings by Titian,
Caravaggio, Guido Reni and Rubens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The She-Wolf'' has always been a symbol of the Eternal City,
diffused throughout the ancient world by Roman coins bearing the
image. ``The She-Wolf'' celebrated in the exhibition is a
fifth-century-B.C. statue donated to the city in 1471 by Pope
Sixtus IV along with three other bronze statues that had been at
the Lateran Palace. These statues formed the core of the Capitoline
Museums collection, the world's oldest collection of public art.
</P>
<P>
   The bronze statues of Romulus and Remus were added after ``The
She-Wolf'' arrived on the Capitoline. They were separated for
restoration and study, but this has not produced any definitive
indication of their possible creator or of their age, though
scholars agree that the twins date from the Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   The legend of Romulus and Remus, the founders of Rome, is
thought by some scholars to date to the fourth century BC. The twin
sons of Rhea Silvia and the god Mars, they were ordered drowned in
the Tiber. Luckily for them, the basin in which they were placed
came to rest at the site of the future Rome, and a she-wolf suckled
them until the shepherd Faustulus found them.
</P>
<P>
   For five centuries Romans were accustomed to seeing the chubby
cherublike brothers suckling the ferocious-looking ``She-Wolf.''
But today they are motherless.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the first time the twins have been separated from the
Lupa in 500 years,'' said Claudio Parisi Presicce, who coordinated
the scientific and technical aspects of the exhibition. ``I hope
they won't suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that the technique used for casting the statues, similar
to that used to make armor, may mean it was done in a famous
workshop in Ferrara, which was very much in vogue at the end of the
15th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The She-Wolf'' and the statues of Romulus and Remus are on
show in separate rooms in a new gallery for temporary exhibitions,
part of a $20 million restoration that will more than double the
Capitoline Museums area by the end of 2001. In late April the first
phase of the so-called Grande Campidoglio (the big Campidoglio, as
the Capitoline Hill is known in Italian) was completed.
</P>
<P>
   The collection of the Capitoline Museums is in two buildings,
the Palazzo dei Conservatori and the Palazzo Nuovo. They face each
other on Capitoline Hill, the highest of the seven hills of ancient
Rome, and for centuries the political and religious heart of the
city.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the improvements to the galleries have been mostly
structural and cosmetic: improving the illumination (with enormous
handmade Murano glass chandeliers), repainting the rooms in their
original pastel colors, restoring the carved ceilings from a dull
brown to their original multicolored intensity and cleaning parts
of the collection.
</P>
<P>
   A tunnel connecting the three main buildings of the Capitoline,
built in the early 1940s but closed for the last 30 years, was also
reopened, providing access to the Tabularium, the
first-century-B.C. Roman state archive built above the Roman Forum,
affording a spectacular view of the ruins below.
</P>
<P>
   Restoration of a wing added in the 1920s when Mussolini was in
power provided some surprises. When the floors were removed,
workers found the remains of the foundations of the
sixth-century-B.C. Temple of Jupiter, the most famous temple of
ancient Rome. The restoration of this part of the museum was halted
to allow the archaeological dig to continue. So far the finds have
excited scholars. For instance, next to the temple, archaeologists
discovered ruins that date from the 16th to the 6th century B.C.,
including tombs of small children.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all very important because the original situation of
the Campidoglio was not known before this dig,'' explained Anna
Mura Sommella, the director of the museum, ``but we have found a
complex archaeological situation which will better explain the life
of this hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the remains of the Temple of Jupiter will be
incorporated in a glass-domed area that will be built to house the
original equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius. The statue, first
put in the Campidoglio in 1538 as part of Michelangelo's design for
the piazza, has been in the courtyard of the Palazzo Nuovo since
1990. (The horse and rider in the center of the Piazza del
Campidoglio is a copy put there in 1997.) A fresco high up in the
Room of the Eagles in the Palazzo dei Conservatori shows what
Capitoline Hill looked like just before Michelangelo's project.
</P>
<P>
   Though the view overlooking the Forum from the Tabularium is
spectacular, it is rivaled by the view from a newly opened cafe
seating more than 300 on the terrace of the Palazzo Caffarelli,
next to ``The She-Wolf'' exhibit. The cafe, a large bookstore and
remodeled ticket offices are part of the museum's attempt at
modernization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the oldest museum in the world, so we didn't want to
change much,'' Mura Sommella said. ``But after all, this is no
longer the 18th century, when Stendhal would visit the museum by
candlelight.''

 Taster's Choice: Lean Cuisine Leads the Chicken Teriyaki Pack   By Robin Davis  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  In the world of frozen foods, chicken teriyaki is
one of the most popular. It comes as frozen dinners, bowls and, in
the latest variation, as skillet meals, designed to be cooked
stovetop in a skillet.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's panel tasted eight frozen chicken teriyakis, pitting
each kind against the other. Results were mixed as to which types
the panel liked best, but the overall feeling was that the skillet
dinners fell short. The panel thought they often looked better than
the bowls and dinners, but the flavors were at best
one-dimensional.
</P>
<P>
   The teriyakis ranged in size from single- to multi-servings. All
were cooked according to preferred package directions, though all
can be made in the microwave and most in a conventional oven.
</P>
<P>
   The highest ranking went to  &UR; Lean Cuisine &LR;  (14 ounces, $3.89 at
Safeway). This meal has all of the components _ chicken, rice and
vegetables _ separate on a microwaveable plate. Panelists liked the
way this product looked and most thought the flavors were well
balanced. One panelist particularly liked the crisp-tender
vegetables, but another thought the textures were too mushy. Four
would buy it and one might.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to  &UR; Uncle Ben's &LR;  (12 ounces, $3.49 at
Andronico's), which came in a bowl. The biggest complaint was that
there was little distinction in the textures of the ingredients.
But most of the panelists thought the sauce was well balanced. One
particularly liked the sesame notes. Two would buy it and three
might buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Third place went to  &UR; Stouffer's &LR;  (25 ounces, $5.69-$5.79 at many
supermarkets). One panelist commented, ``looks like it should taste
fabulous, but it doesn't.'' Some liked the crunchiness of the
vegetables, but most found the flavors one dimensional. Two would
buy it; three would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Chung's Express &LR;  (24 ounces, $5.99 at Andronico's), the only
product to come in pouches, came in fourth. Most panelists agreed
that this product was much too sweet. One also detected unpleasant
chemical notes. But one dissenter admitted he didn't mind the
sweetness; he was put off by the ``mishmash of ingredients.'' One
would buy it; four would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; King's Hawaiian &LR;  (131/4 ounces, $2.99-$3.19 at many
supermarkets) _ another bowl _ came in fifth. Three panelists found
the mixture mushy and sticky. One thought the chicken was dry, but
another liked the sweet/salty balance in the sauce. One might buy
it; four would not.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also tasted Marie Callender's skillet meal, Birds Eye
Chicken Viola and Healthy Choice, but they ranked too low.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists were John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Marc Halperin,
culinary director, Center for Culinary Development; Shelley
Handler, consultant and food writer; Donna Katzl, chef-owner, Cafe
For All Seasons, San Francisco; and Kirk Webber, chef-owner, Cafe
Kati, San Francisco. All products are tasted blind.

 Cook's Books: Despite Crafty Design, Recipes Need Work  &HT;       
 By Deb Wandell 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; That old saw, ``You've gotta have a gimmick,''
buzzes through your mind when you pick up ``The Cook Pack,'' a
pop-up cookbook by chef and BBC-TV personality Gary Rhodes.
<P>
   Twenty ``no-fail'' three-course meals for two, a pocket-size
shopping list and wine guide are bound up in hardback something
like a photo album. It's an eye-catching, if curious, format, and
at first, it's unclear whether to read it or play with it. Turn to
the first laminated page, and there's the author, smiling as he
straddles a chair. Pull a tab and his hair stands on end. Keep
flipping and up pop a cheese grater (actual size), a large wedge of
Swiss, a scratch 'n' sniff page.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as the cure for the culinarily challenged, it's cleverly
designed to appeal to the novice. Rhodes promises to make even the
most reluctant chefs jump at the opportunity to make an elegant
spread at home by taking them through every step, from stocking the
kitchen and setting the table to mixing the cocktails and timing
the preparation down to the minute.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes are non-threatening, and most meals can be made in
less than two hours, with canned or prepared ingredients providing
shortcuts.
</P>
<P>
   Tabs on the outside of each page make it easy to flip to
sections for cocktails, fish, meat, chicken and vegetarian dishes.
Pages start with a menu and brief description of the meal along
with a little bit of cutesy inspiration from the author (``Why not
be romantic and sexy by feeding each other using your fingers''),
then fold out for a list of ingredients and the play-by-play.
Graphics on the facing page illustrate the menu's theme, but they
do little to show how the food should look.
</P>
<P>
   On first inspection, it seems like the ideal book for college
students or friends moving into their first apartment. Yet a closer
look reveals the book leaves a lot of guesswork for cooks.
</P>
<P>
   The British publishers make few allowances for American cooks _
measurements are given in ounces rather than tablespoons and cups,
and the metric conversion wheel in the back of the book is useless.
And while it's easy to assume that the Cos lettuce called for in
the Caesar salad is another name for romaine, it's hard to guess
with groundnut oil. A short glossary in the back of the book seems
more of an afterthought _ with definitions for pesto and couscous,
but nothing clarifying treacle.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the more straightforward recipes are worth trying, like
the caramelized onion and Camembert tart and watercress with walnut
oil in the ``no-meat'' section. A small wheel of cheese is set on a
bed of rosemary-scented slow-cooked onions and then baked in puff
pastry. As promised, it made an impressive entree, cheese spilling
out of the pastry as it was sliced and oozing onto the plate. The
piquant watercress salad helped cut the richness.
</P>
<P>
   Canned borlotti beans were hard to find for the borlotti bean
soup, but the recommended substitution of cannellini beans worked
fine, combined with sauteed carrots and onion, fresh tomatoes and
strips of savoy cabbage for a hearty _ if unspectacular _ first
course. A sprinkling of Parmesan cheese helped bring the flavors
together.
</P>
<P>
   Also intriguing are recipes for slow honey and ginger roasted
duck with spring onion mashed potatoes, and a pan-fried pear with
Stilton and walnuts; and grilled mascarpone plums sound like a nice
ending to a menu that includes spicy parsnip soup and roast
marinated lamb.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, an entree of roast pork sausages with dressed
up canned gravy served on a bed of mashed sweet potatoes couldn't
have sounded more unappealing. The same goes for the fish pie with
cheesy potato topping.
</P>
<P>
   The cocktail section has some interesting suggestions, but a
true martini fan would wince at a recipe that mixes six ounces of
vermouth with three ounces of gin.
</P>
<P>
   Such slips and oversights peppered throughout ``The Cook Pack''
take the wind out of Rhodes' ``no-fail'' claim. And while the
pop-up gimmick is a kick, and the design intriguing, as a cookbook
it is not much of a success.

 Secrets of Success: A Califoria Classic   By Michael Bauer 
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  In the 1970s the connection between goat cheese
and California cuisine became a running joke, and when you added it
to a salad it was the ultimate clich e .
<TEXT>
<P>
   Never mind that goat cheese with salad has been a staple of the
French brasserie for generations. And new generations of
Californians are discovering how wonderful that combination can be
at Baker Street Bistro, the charming neighborhood bistro near the
Marina.
</P>
<P>
   For this delicious salad, rounds of goat cheese are crusted in
crushed walnuts and fresh thyme. They're warmed, then placed on a
nest of mixed baby greens that are delicately dressed with a
red-wine vinaigrette with a touch of balsamic vinegar and Dijon
mustard.

<P>
   &UR; _ Fresh thyme. &LR;  Coating the cheese first in the fresh herbs
adds a clean, herbal flavor to the mild goat cheese.

WARM GOAT CHEESE SALAD
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   15 ounces fresh goat cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup coarsely ground walnuts
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   12 (1/4-inch-thick) slices French bread
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons olive oil + oil for baking sheet
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced parsley
</P>
<P>
   1 pound mixed salad greens
</P>
<P>
   2 cups halved cherry tomatoes or chopped tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced mixed fresh herbs (such as tarragon,
parsley, marjoram)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Divide the cheese into 6 portions (about 21/2 ounces each) and
shape into flat rounds (about 3/8 inch high). Sprinkle each round
with thyme, salt and pepper. Coat with walnuts. Place the cheese
rounds in the freezer until very firm, about 20 to 30 minutes, but
do not let them freeze. Once chilled, the cheeses may be kept in
the refrigerator for up to 1 day.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the red wine vinegar, balsamic vinegar and mustard in a
small bowl, whisking to blend. Gradually whisk in the vegetable oil
until the vinaigrette is completely emulsified. Season with salt
and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange the bread slices on a baking sheet. Use 7 tablespoons of
the olive oil to drizzle on both sides of the bread. Sprinkle with
the chopped parsley. Bake until crisp and golden brown, about 12 to
15 minutes. Maintain oven temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Lightly oil a small baking sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a saute pan. Saute
the rounds of goat cheese over medium heat until the nuts are
browned, about 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the cheeses to the prepared
baking sheet. Bake until the cheeses are warmed through, about 5
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Toss the greens with about half of the vinaigrette. Season with
additional salt and pepper, then add more vinaigrette if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Place the tomatoes in a bowl and toss with the remaining
vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   Divide the greens among serving plates. Place toasts on plates
and top each salad with a warm goat-cheese round. Garnish with the
tomatoes and fresh herbs; serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6.

 Learning To Cook: Old Dish Learns New Tricks   By Marion Cunningham 
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Strata is an old recipe that usually was thought
of as breakfast fare. It is a humble dish that was designed to use
up day-old or stale bread.
<P>
   Strata usually contained bits of ham or cooked bacon and a mild
melting cheese, which were layered between slices of bread in an
oven-to-table baking dish. A simple mixture of milk and beaten eggs
was poured over the top, then it was baked. Today, strata still is
pleasing and very satisfying for breakfast or brunch.
</P>
<P>
   The great appeal of strata is that in our hurried modern lives,
this dish can, in fact, must be assembled a few hours ahead,
preferably the night before, so the bread can soak up all the
custard and the flavors can blend. All that's left to do the next
morning is to preheat the oven and bake the strata.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, I've been preparing strata with vegetables and cheese.
This variation makes a great supper dish. You really can use any
almost filling with the bread, eggs and milk.
</P>
<P>
   Try serving the following recipe for supper, accompanied by a
fresh, green salad and fruit or ice cream to finish the meal.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; VEGETABLE STRATA
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   Butter for baking dish
</P>
<P>
   2 zucchini
</P>
<P>
   1 globe eggplant
</P>
<P>
   1 yellow onion
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound mushrooms (any variety)
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 day-old loaf sliced Italian bread
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces white cheddar cheese
</P>
<P>
   4 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   2 cups milk
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Butter the bottom and sides of a 9 x 12 x 2-inch baking dish.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To prepare the vegetables:  &LR; Cut off the stem and root ends of
the zucchini. Cut the zucchini into 1/8-inch slices. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Trim off the cap and base of the eggplant, then cut the eggplant
in half lengthwise. Wrap one half in plastic and refrigerate for
another use. Set the other half on its side and cut into 3
lengthwise slices. Hold the slices together, place them cut-side
down on a board and cut into 1/2-inch slices lengthwise. Holding
all the slices together, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch cubes. Set
aside.
</P>
<P>
   Cut off the stem and root ends of the onion and peel off the
outer papery skin. Cut the onion in half lengthwise. Wrap half and
refrigerate for another use. Place the other half cut-side down on
a cutting board and cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices.
Holding the slices together, cut crosswise into 1/8-inch dice.
</P>
<P>
   Using a damp cloth (or a mushroom brush) wipe off the mushrooms
so no dirt is clinging to them. Break off the steams. Cut the stems
in half or thirds and set aside. Cut the mushroom caps into
1/4-inch slices. Holding the slices together, cut crosswise into
1/2-inch pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Combine all the vegetables and season lightly with salt and
pepper, moving the pieces around so the seasonings are evenly
distributed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cooking the vegetables:  &LR; Pour the olive oil into a large
skillet. Tilt the pan so the olive oil evenly coats the inside.
Turn the heat to medium-high. When the oil feels very warm when you
place your hand about an inch above the skillet, add the
vegetables, spreading them out in the pan. Cook, stirring
constantly until they are lightly browned. This takes about 6 to 8
minutes. Remove from heat. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Preparing the bread and cheese:  &LR; Cut off the crusts from the
bread slices. Coarsely grate the cheese.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mixing the eggs and milk:  &LR; Crack the eggs and drop into a bowl.
Using a fork, stir and mix the eggs until they are all one color.
Add the milk and stir briskly to blend well.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Assembling the dish:  &LR; Fit a single layer of bread slices into
the baking dish. Top with half of the vegetables. Sprinkle one
third of the grated cheese over the vegetables. Add another layer
of bread slices, then repeat layering, ending with a layer of
bread.
</P>
<P>
   Drizzle the egg-milk mixture over the top. Sprinkle with the
remaining cheese. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate
overnight, or for at least 3 hours before baking.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the dish from the refrigerator and take off the plastic
wrap. Place the dish in the oven and bake for 40 minutes. Test for
doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center. If it comes out
with wet custard clinging to it, return to the oven to bake another
10 minutes. Test again. The top of the strata should be lightly
browned and the toothpick should be moist with crumbs, but not wet.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4 to 6.

 Correction 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Last week's Working Cook's Now and Later recipe omitted part of the
directions for preparing the eggplant. Here is the corrected
version.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
LASAGNA alla NORMA
</P>
<P>
   The sausage in this recipe may be omitted, as the sauce,
vegetables and cheeses offer plenty of flavor on their own. To
freeze, assemble the lasagna and tightly wrap the portion you wish
to save for later, label it and place in the freezer. Bake the
other portion and serve for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 large globe eggplants
</P>
<P>
   Salt, as needed
</P>
<P>
   5 Italian sausages, casings removed (optional)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil + olive oil to grease pans
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon hot red pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried oregano leaves, crushed
</P>
<P>
   3 yellow onions, cut into medium dice
</P>
<P>
   4 red bell peppers, deveined and cut into medium dice
</P>
<P>
   3 boxes (26 ounces each) Pomi chopped tomatoes, or equivalent
amount of canned tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   1/2 bunch basil
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   About 16 sheets lasagna noodles
</P>
<P>
   30 ounces whole-milk ricotta cheese
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups grated pecorino cheese
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Trim the eggplants and cut into 1/4-inch slices. Place the
slices in a colander, salting each layer. Weight with a heavy
object to extract the eggplants' bitter juices.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the sauce:  &LR; Brown the sausages in a Dutch oven,
crumbling them into bite-size pieces. Remove from pan with a
slotted spoon and set aside to cool. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil to
the pan. Adjust heat to medium-low. Add the pepper flakes and
oregano; saute for 1 minute. Add the onions and saute for 5
minutes. Add the bell peppers and saute until tender, 10 to 15
minutes. Add the tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 30
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Lightly grease 2 large sheet pans (or more, as needed) with
olive oil. Remove weight from eggplant and rinse the eggplant well
to remove salt and bitter juices. Pat dry. Transfer the eggplant
slices to the sheet pans, arranging them in a single layer. Season
with salt. Roast for 15 minutes. Turn the slices over, return to
the oven and roast until tender, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Set aside
to cool.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly chop 6 basil leaves. Add them and the sausage to the
sauce and simmer a few minutes to combine flavors. Season with salt
and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Cook the lasagna noodles according to package directions.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To assemble: &LR;  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees. Spoon a
little of the sauce in two 9 x 13-inch casserole dishes, spreading
it with the back of the spoon to coat the bottom of the dishes.
Layer one quarter of the noodles in each casserole, top with
eggplant slices, more sauce, some ricotta and a few basil leaves.
Repeat layering with the remaining noodles, eggplant, sauce,
ricotta and basil. Top each casserole with grated pecorino.
</P>
<P>
   Bake uncovered until bubbly and golden, about 30 minutes. If the
cheese does not brown in the oven, place under the broiler for a
few minutes.

   Serves 12.

casual stroll turns up culinary treasures. &HT;     
 Food Lovers' Walks: Calistoga Shows It's Food-Friendly   By Karola Saekel  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; CALISTOGA, Calif. _  &LR; If Gold Rush millionaire Sam Brannan had been
able to consult a  &LR; feng shui &LR;  book in 1860 before he laid out his
dream of a Saratoga Springs of the West, the little town of
Calistoga might never have slipped into relative obscurity and its
visionary founder might not have ended up broke and broken.
<P>
   But the  &UR; Calistoga Bookstore &LR; , with its fine selection of books
on wine and  &LR; feng shui &LR; , wasn't around then.
</P>
<P>
   So Brannan's hotel burned to the ground, the dance pavilion,
race track and most other trappings of a smart spa fell into
disrepair, leaving behind a pleasant backwater where visitors could
find mud baths, eminently proper massages and sustenance of sorts,
but hardly fine cuisine _ until a good century later.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, despite an abundance of good restaurants, Calistoga
retains the feel of a small Western town, with low-slung buildings
and an old railroad depot that houses the chamber of commerce and
tourist-oriented businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Among things you won't find are fast-food or chain operations.
If you want to sip a latte, don't look for any of the familiar
logos, but the  &UR; Calistoga Roastery &LR;  will serve you well. With its
friendly, laid-back service, slightly ramshackle appearance and
homey food, it's the antithesis of the slick efficiency of a chain.
</P>
<P>
   If you're an early riser, snatch a cup of coffee, a croissant
and bread for later at chef Fred Halpert's  &UR; Napa Valley Ovens &LR; ,
which opens at 6 a.m. and closes ``whenever we run out of most
things.''
</P>
<P>
   A later possibility is tiny  &UR; Good 'N' Airy Angel &LR; , which lets
you supplement coffee with a toothsome sweet or an ice cream cone.
For serious breakfast, one of the most popular choices is
 &UR; Cafe Sarafornia &LR; . But why Sarafornia? The story goes that Gold Rush
millionaire Brannan _ who abandoned his Mormon faith rather than
fulfill his tithing duties _ was inebriated at a ceremony promoting
his resort as the Saratoga of California. At least that's what he
meant to say. What came out was ``the Calistoga of Sarafornia.''
Hence, the name of the town _ and now the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The shopper with food and wine in the mind is in luck here. On
the high end, there is  &UR; Enoteca &LR;  fine wines and antiques. The only
second-story business in town, it is located in the high-ceilinged
former ballroom of the 1887 International Order of Odd Fellows
(IOOF) building.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Margaux Singleton scours the world for hand-crafted wines,
including many rare dessert wines. Prices can go as high as $1,300
for a bottle, but, she asserts you can also get some nice wines for
$10.
</P>
<P>
   A unique experience awaits at  &UR; Ca'toga Galleria d'Arte &LR; ,
internationally acclaimed muralist Carlo Marchiori's stunning
gallery. Along with whimsical  &LR; commedia dell'arte &LR;  masks, screens
and wall decorations, Marchiori creates fabulous ceramic plates,
bowls and platters. Twelve-inch plates start at $60, and prices go
up from there.
</P>
<P>
   For the artistically inclined with a more restricted budget,
there is  &UR; Evans Ceramics Gallery &LR; , the only direct retail outlet of
Evans Designs of Healdsburg, a group of artists that produces fine
glass and ceramics, including Raku ware. Prices are 40 to 90
percent off what these pieces fetch in high-end department stores
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   For shoppers who want to combine practicality with aesthetics,
the  &UR; Home and Garden Shop &LR;  of  &UR; Palisades Market &LR;  is not to be
missed _ yet it's easy to miss since it is located behind the
market. Owner Victoria Gott has assembled an eclectic mix of basics
like white Cordon Bleu tableware; Asian serving pieces (including
square plates, the current darlings of trendy restaurants); casual
table linens and much more.
</P>
<P>
   The Gott family started Palisades Market eight years ago selling
high-end vittles: artisan breads, cheeses, p &LR; a &LR; t &LR; e &LR; s, wine,
made-to-order sandwiches and picnic-oriented take-out.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Gott and sons Joel and Duncan have since expanded. First
came the home annex, now they are remodeling the original store,
adding more space for the deli and bake shop.
</P>
<P>
   They are also reopening the drive-in at the next-door former
glider port, calling it Fred's Refresher (they already operate
Taylor's Refresher in St. Helena).
</P>
<P>
   Palisades' take-out or a sandwich or salad from  &UR; Calmart &LR;  across
the street (no relation to the San Francisco market by that name),
are the most casual lunch options, but most of the nearly two dozen
local restaurants serve lunch.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pacifico Restaurante Mexicano &LR;  serves good food at great prices
(many items well under $10) in a cheery setting. At  &UR; Catahoula &LR; 
 &UR; Restaurant and Saloon, &LR;  chef/owner Jan Birnbaum's New
Orleans-inspired food is sophisticated and plentiful _
rabbit-crawfish gumbo, a pulled pork sandwich with slaw and
barbecued sweet potato chips. Everything is house-made, even the
bun and the bread-and-butter pickles on the oven-roasted sirloin
burger.
</P>
<P>
   The handsome  &UR; Brannan's Grill &LR; , with a decor that blends
elements of the original 1906 building with modern design, also
serves substantial fare _ think voodoo shrimp or hanger steak.
</P>
<P>
   Several restaurants offer patio seating. Two favorites are the
 &UR; Calistoga Inn, Restaurant &AMP; Brewery &LR;  and  &UR; Wappo Bar &AMP; Bistro &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The inn (yes, there are rooms for rent) also serves micro brews,
including barley wine (actually a dark, dense beer with a hint of
sweetness), so strong it's only poured by the half-pint. There are
hot entrees, but the best bets are generous sandwiches like grilled
chicken breast, bacon, guacamole, lettuce and tomato on focaccia
for $9.25. Even if you don't capture one of the prized tables above
the river, a stone fountain splashes coolness amid the dappled
sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   At eclectic Wappo, with menu inspirations circling the globe,
the leaf-shaded patio has a Mediterranean feel _ as does the
friendly, why-hurry service. Thai noodle salad with chicken is a
local favorite, and you would be hard put to find a better or
prettier Ni &LR; c &LR; oise salad with grilled fresh tuna.
</P>
<P>
   Lunch prices at these and most nearby restaurants range from
$9-$14.
</P>
<P>
   As a last stop, visit the  &UR; Sharpsteen Museum &LR;  for a glimpse into
Calistoga's history. Its front area is Sam Brannan's own opulent
Victorian ``cottage,'' the only remaining building of his grand
resort, moved to this site in the 1970s and furnished with
appropriate period pieces. But don't look for a kitchen. The
eccentric entrepreneur's guests were expected to take their meals
in the hotel.

 &HT;    HUMAN TRIALS UNDERWAY FOR ALZHEIMER'S DRUG
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A small group of Alzheimer's disease patients
suffered no apparent side effects from an experimental vaccine that
appears to remove brain cell ``plaques'' associated with the
disease, drug company researchers revealed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration-approved trial was not designed
to reveal whether the vaccinations were effective in treating the
disease, said officials of Elan Corp., a pharmaceuticals
development company.
</P>
<P>
   However, many scientists believe the plaques impede brain cell
function and cause cell death in persons with Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   If the vaccine is ultimately approved for use on human beings,
it could be given both to prevent Alzheimer's disease in persons at
risk and to treat active cases, Elan officials said.
</P>
<P>
   They declined to speculate about when a treatment based on the
substance might be available. The company does not expect to begin
conducting trials that may determine the substance's effectiveness
in humans until late next year. It could be at least a year after
that before the company applies for an FDA license to market the
vaccine _ and months more before a treatment is available to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   In a presentation at the World Alzheimer (cq, singular) Congress
2000 here, researcher Dale Schenk said tests on laboratory animals
show the vaccine provokes an immune response that clears
disease-causing substances called ``amyloid plaques'' from diseased
brain tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it causes antibodies to 'tag' the amyloid cells so
that scavenger cells in the brain come along and remove them,''
Schenk said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Although the plaques are found in the brains of most individuals
with Alzheimer's, it is not known whether they are a cause _ or a
result _ of the disease process.
</P>
<P>
   A protein known as beta amyloid has been identified as a primary
component of the plaques.
</P>
<P>
   Over 1,000 persons attending the conference sat in silence while
Schenk showed slides of brain tissues of mice before and after
receiving the vaccine, which has been designated ``AN-1792'' and is
a synthetic form of the naturally occurring beta amyloid protein.
</P>
<P>
   The synthetic protein stimulates production of antibodies
leading a biochemical attack on the plaques, Schenk said. After the
plaque cells are ``tagged'' by the antibodies, he said, other brain
cells called microglial cells begin engulfing them and removing
them from the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Elan, which was founded in Dublin, Ireland, has offices and
plants in Ireland, Israel and several U.S. cities, including
Gainesville, Ga., and Miramar, Fla. The company revealed a year ago
in the journal Nature that AN-1792 removed plaques from mice that
had been genetically engineered to develop human Alzheimer's
disease.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to single doses given to 24 Americans with early and
moderate Alzheimer's disease, the vaccine is being given in
multiple doses to a larger group of volunteers in Great Britain,
Schenk said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there are no results from the British trial, which is
designed to show both whether the vaccine has harmful side effects
and whether it causes persons who receive it to build up antibodies
to the beta amyloid protein.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a few years ago, talk of a potential vaccine for
Alzheimer's disease would have been viewed with much skepticism,''
said Bill Thies, vice president of medical and scientific affairs
of the Alzheimer's Association. ``Announcements like this that are
grounded in solid scientific research give us tremendous hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivan M. Lieberburg, executive vice president of Elan, declined
to reveal company projections about the potential market value of
the proposed vaccine but noted that between 150,000 and 200,000
Americans are diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease every year.
Currently, over 20 million Americans are believed to have
Alzheimer's or some other form of dementia.
</P>
<P>
   --STORY COULD TRIM HERE
</P>
<P>
   In another study presented at the conference, Dutch scientists
reported that persons who ate large amounts of vegetables and took
vitamins E and C were slightly less likely of contracting
Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers compared recorded dietary habits and health
records of over 5,000 persons for a period of six years. The
reported slight but significant decreases in Alzheimer's and
dementia risk among those who took the two vitamins and ate
vegetables but found no relation between eating fruit or taking the
food supplements beta carotene, flavonoids and selenium.

HARRY POTTER'S STILL GOT THAT MAGIC

</P>
<P>
   By JEFF GUINN &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Because of all the hoopla _ a first printing of 3.8 million; the
frantic efforts by the publisher to keep the book under wraps until
its official publication last Saturday; the movie deal; the
gazillion toys about to flood every Toys R Us in existence _ it's
hard to judge ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' objectively.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the attention from Wall Street and Hollywood, it's still
the fourth book in a one-a-year series for kids, not adults.
``Goblet'' was long rumored to have a ``darker'' story line than
the previous Harry titles, mostly because author J.K. Rowling
realized her young audience was growing up along with their
favorite fictional wizard-in-training. Some major character was
going to ``die'' in this one, the grapevine suggested. Harry was
going to discover girls.
</P>
<P>
   All that turns out to be true, but within the simpler context of
children's literature. No reasonable grown-up is going to plow
through ``Goblet's'' overlong 734 pages without finding lots of
plot developments that defy logic, even magical logic. In the
process of trying to cram all sorts of subplots into what should
have been a much tighter, focused story, Rowling throws innumerable
characters and red herring twists-and-turns onto her literary wall
in hopes some will stick. Not enough do.
</P>
<P>
   Harry's fourth adventure finds him sprung early from his annual
summer indenture to Muggle (nonmagical) relatives. He attends the
finals of the International Quidditch Cup with his friends Hermione
and Ron and the bumptious Weasley family. The great event is
sullied by a demonstration by ``Death Eaters,'' Muggle-hating
wizards who follow Harry's nemesis, evil Lord Voldemort.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Harry and pals return to Hogwarts, where they begin
the fourth of their seven-year training program. Almost instantly,
it is announced that Hogwarts will participate in a long-banned
``Triwizard Tournament,'' where champions from Hogwarts and two
other schools of magic will compete in a series of highly dangerous
challenges. The winner receives a bag of gold and, of course,
recognition as the finest young wizard or witch around. Hogwarts
hosts the contest, which carries over from fall through spring.
</P>
<P>
   Harry, now 14, is supposedly too young to enter his name as a
possible contestant. A magic ``goblet of fire'' will determine each
school's champion. When teams from the other schools arrive, the
goblet selects their representatives, and Hogwarts'. But, after
long moments, the goblet tosses out a fourth contestant _ Harry
Potter, of course.
</P>
<P>
   It's a dangerous honor. Harry is instantly shunned by most
Hogwarts classmates, who feel he's somehow cheated his way in.
There's also the real possibility that Voldemort or one of his
minions has connived to enter Harry so he can be conveniently
disposed of during the tournament. An eventual wizardly throw-down
between Harry and Voldemort leaves both antagonists bloody but
determined to fight again.
</P>
<P>
   Then come the subplots. Yes, a few involve pubescent romance,
but those are pretty well tossed aside once they've been
introduced. Rowling also uses ``Goblet'' as a soapbox for her
thoughts on racism, animal rights and the tabloid press.
</P>
<P>
   This is, certainly, allowable. C.S. Lewis made his ``Narnia''
yarns allegories for Christian faith. T.H. White's ``The Once and
Future King'' used the Arthurian legend as a platform for pacifism.
</P>
<P>
   But Rowling simply goes on too long. She'll be forgiven by Harry
loyalists, who love any Hogwarts sub-tales whether they're really
necessary or not. But Harry-come-latelys, kids who try to start
with ``Goblet'' instead of ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's
Stone,'' the first in the series, are going to wonder what all the
fuss has been about.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to ``Goblet's'' publication, parents seemed most worried
on one of two fronts _ the anticipated death of a beloved
character, which might shatter young psyches, and the focus on
magic/witchcraft, which could lead innocents into devil worship.
Neither concern is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, someone nice dies near the end of the book. But,
predictably, it isn't someone who would have been considered a
major cast member in the three previous tales. And, yes, there are
spells and incantations, but they're far removed from truly
sinister real-life witchery. Rowling has faults as an author, but
she certainly seems to have a responsible attitude on this subject.
</P>
<P>
   All 734 pages of ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' will be
gleefully devoured by Rowling's millions of kid readers. They'll
close the book already anticipating next year's fifth installment.
So, on that level, the book is a success.
</P>
<P>
   As literature for adults, ``Goblet's'' an occasional spark, not
a full-fledged fire. But the book wasn't really written for us, was
it?

 &HT;    RELEASED WOMAN SAYS SHE DOES NOT REGRET FIGHT TO 'LIBERATE' IRAN
 &HT;    By MIRIAM A. GARCIA
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Mahnaz Samadi, fresh from a federal prison, said
Tuesday she did not regret her efforts to ``liberate'' her native
Iran from a repressive government.
</P>
<P>
   Samadi was ordered released by an immigration court Monday after
being held for 98 days, sometimes in shackles, by the Immigration
and Naturalization Service on suspicion of being associated with a
terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
   Samadi, 35, says she was tortured when she was held in an
Iranian prison between 1982 and 1986, and says the government
executed two of her brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I witnessed things that made me determined to fight,'' Samadi
said through a translator at a Capitol Hill news conference.
</P>
<P>
   She fled to the United States in 1994, but INS officials say she
fraudulently attained political asylum because she did not disclose
her affiliation with the National Liberation Army of Iran, the
military wing of the Iranian resistance.
</P>
<P>
   The INS took her into custody this year after she was deported
from Canada, which said her past associations made her a danger to
the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was safe here,'' Samadi said. ``But I found
instead I was betrayed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought freedom of political belief was sacred here,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the court nearing Monday in Arlington, Va., the INS agreed
not to deport Samadi to Iran, but she is subject to deportation to
a third country. Maria Cardona, an INS spokeswoman, said there are
no plans to deport her to another country at this time.
</P>
<P>
   Samadi will remain in this country until it is safe for her to
return to Iran, her attorney Michael Maggio said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason she wants to be here is because she can't be
in Tehran safely,'' Maggio said.
</P>
<P>
   Samadi's release was sought by 62 members of Congress who wrote
a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., described Samadi as a
``freedom fighter'' who has dedicated her life to fighting for
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not regret fighting to liberate my country,'' Samadi
said.

 &HT;    Reno kicks off ``First Monday'' anti-gun rally
 &HT;    By Eunice Moscoso
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno joined lawmakers
Tuesday to announce ``a national day of action to end gun
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The event _ ``First Monday 2000'' _ is planned to coincide with
the first day of the Supreme Court term, Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   At a kick-off rally, Reno told an auditorium full of students
``to feel as passionate and speak out with as much vigor as those
who think their guns are their most precious possession.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got to take the force, the feeling, the power that I
sense in this nation and translate it into action,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to organizers, about 200 events will be held at U.S.
campuses and communities around Oct. 2 to spark discussion and
activism to reduce gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's rally, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development
Andrew Cuomo said gun violence is the ``one glaring aberration'' in
a time of unprecedented ``promise, hope and progress'' in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to gun violence, ``we not only are not the leaders
on the globe, but we are the caboose on the train,'' he said. ``In
some ways we are the most uninformed, the most unintelligent when
it comes to this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress also attended the rally, including Rep.
Connie Morella , R-Md., and Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, a New York
Democrat who is the leading gun control advocate in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``First Monday'' is an annual, national initiative coordinated
by Physicians for Social Responsibility and the Alliance for
Justice, a coalition of liberal advocacy groups. Previous events,
held mostly at U.S. law schools, were designed to encourage budding
lawyers to work with public-interest advocacy organizations on
different issues.
</P>
<P>
   This year, gun control proponents said they hope to organize
events at more communities and colleges, including schools of
social work, nursing, medical, and public health.
</P>
<P>
   Some October events will feature a 30-minute documentary film,
``Up in Arms,'' directed by Liz Garbus and Rory Kennedy. According
to the Alliance for Justice, the film presents the ``epidemic of
gun violence'' in America and provides examples of successful
activism by citizens from all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups sponsoring First Monday 2000 include Handgun
Control, Inc., the American Bar Association and the American
Academy of Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   Gun violence claims the lives of more than 32,000 people each
year and injures an estimated 90,000 more, according to the First
Monday web site.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's rally, at the headquarters of the National Education
Agency, comes one week after the NEA voted to launch a petition
drive for Congress to pass ``meaningful gun control'' next year.
</P>
<P>
   After a vigorous debate at its national convention in Chicago, a
clear majority of NEA delegates supported a motion urging
affiliates of the teachers union to collect signatures on petitions
favoring ``licensure, registration, bullet imprinting, child safety
locks, (and) mandatory background checks including waiting
periods.''

 &HT;    MANY ELDERLY FALL FOR 'LIVING TRUST' SCAMS, PANEL TOLD
 &HT;    380&AMP;add.
 &HT;    Eds: Material for a box at end of story.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Elderly Americans are being victimized by scam
artists selling living trusts to people who often don't need them,
a Senate panel was told Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Living trusts are legal documents that transfer a person's
property into a trust with the intention of protecting assets and
avoiding costly probate proceedings when the person dies.
</P>
<P>
   But unscrupulous sellers are peddling living trusts which often
are legally defective and are frequently a device to raid an
unsuspecting senior's life savings, the Senate Special Committee on
Aging was told.
</P>
<P>
   ``What these fast-talking crooks don't tell their clients is
that the 'living trust' they're selling could become the buyer's
'living hell,' `` said Esther ``Tess'' Canja, president of AARP,
formerly the American Associ a living trust company that was shut
down in California.
</P>
<P>
   Once a living trust was signed, salesmen would pressure elderly
victims into converting their assets into insurance annuities which
paid low interest over a long period. The salesmen would make a
hefty commission from the sale of the annuity.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Walter Kulinski, an 82-year-old Wisconsin man, fell victim to
such a scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Kulinski was sold a living trust by United Seniors Alliance, and
$280,000 he owned in mutual funds and stocks were converted into a
long-term annuity that he could not use for 10 years without
substantial penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does an 82-year-old man need with a 30-year annuity?''
asked his daughter-in-law, Judy Kulinski, who testified before the
Senate panel.
</P>
<P>
   United Seniors Alliance was shut down and paid Kulinski less
than $27,000 restitution, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Regulation of living wills and annuity sales are generally
handled by state governments, but Sen. John Breaux, D-La.,
suggested there may be room for federal involvement to stop scam
artists from closing operations in one state and opening in
another.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Kolish(cq), associate director of the Federal Trade
Commission's bureau of consumer protection, said the FTC has
received relatively few complaints about living trusts.
</P>
<P>
   But the FTC on Tuesday released a pamphlet for consumers giving
them advice on how to make sure they purchase a credible living
trust. The pamphlet will be distributed to a variety of elderly
organizations and is available on the commission's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, the committee's chairman, said the
elderly should be extremely careful when setting up a living will.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice to older Americans is: find a financial planner who
lives in your town, who has roots in your community, and stick with
that person. A stranger who knocks on the door may be here today,
gone tomorrow, along with a chunk of your savings.''

</P>
<P>
   HOW TO AVOID LIVING TRUST SCAMS
</P>
<P>
   _ Use a lawyer. Most state laws require that an attorney draft
the trust.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't buy at home. Go to the lawyer's or financial planner's
office. Door-to-door living trust sales are usually a scam.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask for written credentials. Check with references of
satisfied customers. Check with the local Better Business Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   _ Beware AARP references. AARP does not endorse any living trust
companies.

`YOUNG AMERICANS' IS AN OLD APPROACH FOR THE WB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will is the epitome of the poor kid who for years eyed the
glistening boarding school across town as a utopia of perfect
lawns, perfect people, perfect life. If only he could get in. He
does, buying the strenuous entrance exam on, of all things, the
Internet, and the ``poor kid with good grades,'' as Will describes
himself in voice-over, is admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Buying a prep school's exam on the Internet is only one of the
improbable twists masquerading as drama in ``Young Americans,'' a
series that has assembled a collection of actors so gorgeous they
almost seem to blend into the magnificent architecture, greenery
and rolling hills surrounding them.
</P>
<P>
   If only someone had been as calculating with the script, which
can make even the prettiest of these people look as though they're
performing a high school production. ``Young Americans,'' beginning
its summer run Wednesday night, is the typical WB serial, in which
story and character development are secondary to ``types'' being
tossed into an assortment of emotional turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Will (Rodney Scott) is the pulse of this five-person ensemble, a
local boy representing this quaint little New England hamlet called
Rawley. (It's actually filmed right outside Baltimore.) It's a
perfect little place from the viewers' vantage point, but Will is
quick to give us the lowdown. ``OK place to grow up,'' he says at
the beginning of the episode. ``But as far as options, kinda
limited.''
</P>
<P>
   He's a smart boy from a poor family breaking townie tradition by
joining the enemy, the all-boys Rawley Academy, which is filled
with rich kids who zip around town in fast cars and make the sort
of authoritative smirks that come with the knowledge that they
could buy the whole place if they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Will's father looks less than thrilled while dropping
him off at school in the old pickup; Mom wants to kiss him goodbye
while Dad merely sneers. But, as Will lets us know, he has no
choice. ``For those who attend here,'' he says, ``the future can be
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The future is already anything for Scout (Mark Famiglietti),
Will's rich-boy roommate who has enough confidence and charisma to
go for Bella (Kate Bosworth), a local girl working at her father's
gas station and waiting to be discovered by, well, judging by her
working digs, Playboy.
</P>
<P>
   The two become so passionate so fast that you almost believe
Bella when she answers Scout's ``What are you thinking?'' question
with ``Is this the guy I'm going to spend the rest of my life
with?''
</P>
<P>
   Even with a story line that will eventually throw cold water on
their heated hormones and viewers for a loop, Scott and Bella
aren't the episode's most intriguing couple. That honor belongs to
Hamilton (Ian Somerhalder), son of the school's dean, and Jake
(Katherine Moennig), a motorcycle-riding rebel whose character is
also a direct rip-off of a recent Oscar-noteworthy film. I wouldn't
dare spoil the fun you'll have watching these two go through their
paces. (Not that you probably won't get it during the first two
scenes.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Young Americans'' will probably be a flat experience to anyone
who watches TV regularly since it does little more than remind us
of other television shows we've seen and probably like a whole lot
better.
</P>
<P>
   At least it's a knockoff with pretensions. Executive producer
Steven Antin, a rising feature-film screenwriter, (he wrote and
produced ``Inside Monkey Zetterland'' in 1993) believes that this
is a gleaming original. For that reason alone, ``Young Americans,''
even with that posturing, self-confident name, provides some
inadvertent entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the series is so lacking in original thought that it
has introduced a teacher named Finn (Ed Quinn), who is, of course,
a glib, earnest, shaggy-looking fellow who considers Hemingway the
greatest man who ever lived.
</P>
<P>
   It's Finn who finds out about Will's Internet purchase and
hounds him to do ``the right thing.'' But this, too, only leads to
the delivery of overcooked dialogue and more evidence of how hollow
and self-adoring this series appears to be.
</P>
<P>
   Will asks Finn if he can take the exam again, which Finn
permits, as long as he throws in an essay about his life and what
he wants out of it. After having to sit through parts of the essay,
courtesy of Will's voice-over, we get this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Got good news and bad news,'' Finn tells Will. ``The good news
is that you passed. The bad news is that you're a writer.''
</P>
<P>
   And about that cheating, well, let's forget it.
</P>

REPLICAS OF COLUMBUS' SHIPS FALLING APART UNDER TEXAS GROUP'S CARE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spain always found Texas a confusing place to do business.
</P>
<P>
   The conquistadors never really had a good time in our state, but
they were worried sick the French would get it.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, the French didn't want it that much either, and
eventually both countries were more or less escorted out.
</P>
<P>
   Spain got friendly with Texas again in 1993 when it allowed
replicas of the New World-famous Nina, Pinta and Santa Maria to
sail to Corpus Christi where the ships were supposed to receive a
glorious home.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish were again disappointed. No gold, no silver, no
grand home for the ships.
</P>
<P>
   The three ships are closed to the public now, two of them
dry-docked and in disrepair. All the promises broken.
</P>
<P>
   They are replica ships, but they are spectacular replicas. We
got to see one in North Texas about there years ago when it was
trucked up Texas highways from Corpus Christi to the canals of Los
Colinas.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, hundreds of schoolchildren from small Texas towns
crawled all over the Nina.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers made the ship part of their lesson plans months in
advance of the visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We estimate that by the end of this trip, about 10,000
schoolchildren will have visited the Nina, and about 15,000 to
20,000 people in all,'' Lisa Fisher of the Columbus Fleet
Association, the nonprofit organization that has custody of the
three ships, said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The association had a crew of nine along on the trip, including
the ship's captain, first mate, shipwright and several hands.
Volunteers also helped from time to time, leading groups aboard the
ship, answering questions and selling souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   Spain moved the replica ships to Corpus Christi because
thousands of Texans wrote to Spain's King Juan Carlos and asked for
them. In 1992, the ships sailed the route Columbus took from Spain
and were on display in Miami before going to Corpus Christi.
</P>
<P>
   They remained the property of the king of Spain, but the
Columbus Fleet Association had a 50-year lease agreement with the
Spanish government.
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to be a cozy arrangement that brought glory to
Spain and tourists to Corpus Christi.
</P>
<P>
   But since 1995, the Pinta and Santa Maria have been sitting on
concrete behind the Corpus Christi Museum of Science and History. A
crash with a barge damaged them.
</P>
<P>
   The Nina is docked at the Lawrence Street dock, but all three
are closed to the public. The fleet association decided in October
that it couldn't keep its commitments with Spain and that the ships
should be returned.
</P>
<P>
   The association threw up its hands and agreed it did a lousy job
of taking care of the Columbus ships. It decided to gather them up
and hand them back _ in pieces, more or less _ to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   This week, another group said it wanted to reopen the ships to
at least generate some income; resurrect some interest, and to
bring tourists back to the city's Museum of Science and History.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbus Fleet Association, the group that admitted that it
ruined the project in the first place, objected.
</P>
<P>
   Spain, in the meantime, doesn't know what to do. It has said it
will look at a new agreement, but this time, it is also
entertaining an offer from a group in Florida.

LOBSTER WITH PEACH COLESLAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (This is the fourth of eight columns by Michel Richard, the chef
and owner of Citronelle in Washington. They are being written with
Marian Burros.) 
 By MARIAN BURROS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A long time ago my wife came back from the market and
gave me some peaches that were as hard as a rock, as they too often
are. I decided to slice them very, very thin and mix them with a
crisp salad. The flavor wasn't right, so I tried the peaches in a
coleslaw instead. Because we always serve lobster with fruit, like
papaya, I put this coleslaw with it. The flavors are sweet and
sweet, and it's a very refreshing dish for summer.
</P>
<P>
   Although we do not have sweet salads in France, when I came to
the United States I fell in love with coleslaw. Unripe peaches are
not dripping with juice, but they do have a little peachy flavor
and good firm texture. Cut into julienne strips, they are a perfect
replacement for cabbage. The sweet and sharp flavors are so
unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   I make the dressing with yogurt because my wife and I are always
trying to lose some weight, so we use yogurt instead of oil. Yogurt
also has acidity and creaminess. When the peaches sit in the
dressing overnight, it wilts them, as happens with regular
coleslaw. And I mix in ginger and chives for some savory flavor _ I
don't want it to taste like fruit salad.
</P>
<P>
   The soft texture of the lobster and the crispness of the peaches
make a very good balance in a very elegant dish. I steam the
lobster, then massage the meat with olive oil and warm it in a very
low oven to keep it very, very moist. (If you have guests, you can
steam and shell the lobster early, then finish the dish in
minutes.) I also drizzle the lobster with lemon juice and maple
syrup for sweetness and extra flavor. Sugar would only taste sweet
here, but maple syrup has a burned caramel flavor, and adds extra
complexity to the lobster.
</P>
<P>
   You could also use sauteed scallops because scallops, like
lobster, are sweet and tender.
</P>
<P>
   I've tried this with white peaches, but it does not look as
good. Although unripe yellow peaches are very pale, they provide a
delicate color contrast to the other ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   I garnish the dish with a fresh herb, usually chervil, for a
little anise flavor, but anything but cilantro will do. And just to
make the coleslaw look like a mimosa salad, like a flower, I
sprinkle it with sieved hard-cooked egg yolk, heated in a microwave
to dry it out so it doesn't clump. It looks very elegant although
it doesn't add much flavor.
</P>
<P>
   LOBSTER WITH PEACH COLESLAW
</P>
<P>
   Time: 40 minutes, plus at least 2 hours' marinating
</P>
<P>
   For the coleslaw:
</P>
<P>
   { cup plain whole-milk yogurt
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   Juice of { small lemon
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon finely grated fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   4 unripe peaches (1\ pounds), peeled and cut into [-inch
julienne strips
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 hard-cooked egg yolk
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons chopped chives
</P>
<P>
   For the lobster:
</P>
<P>
   2 lobsters, 1 to 1{ pounds each
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon maple syrup
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Chervil and curly parsley, for garnish
</P>
<P>
   1. To prepare coleslaw: In a medium bowl, combine yogurt, sugar,
lemon juice and ginger. Add peaches, and season to taste with salt
and pepper. Cover and refrigerate for at least two hours,
preferably overnight.
</P>
<P>
   2. To prepare lobster: Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Place a rack
in a large steamer (or a roasting pan filled with an inch of water)
and bring water to a boil. Steam lobsters for 4 minutes. When
lobsters are cool enough to handle, carefully remove meat from
knuckles and claws so that meat remains intact. Break tails from
bodies. Leaving tails in shells, cut tails in half lengthwise.
</P>
<P>
   3. Mix maple syrup with lemon juice, and set aside. Massage meat
with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Place in
a glass baking dish with tail meat facing up. Bake for 4 minutes,
or until meat has turned white and is no longer transparent.
</P>
<P>
   4. To serve, put egg yolk through a sieve, and dry it for 10
seconds in a microwave oven on high. In center of each of four
plates, place a portion of peach coleslaw. Sprinkle coleslaw with
egg yolk and chives. Remove lobster tails from their shells, and
rub lobster with a little more olive oil. Arrange a lobster claw,
knuckle and half a tail around coleslaw. Drizzle with maple syrup
mixture, and garnish with chervil and curly parsley.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

   One of these days Arshile Gorky, the great, and first, Abstract
Expressionist, will get the biography he deserves, but it won't be
easy. Gorky, born Manoug Adoian in the western Armenian province of
Van around 1904, was a flamboyant dissembler. The Turks' genocidal
campaign from 1915 to 1918 wiped out much of his family and his
past and made ``starving Armenian'' a painfully familiar phrase.
Fiercely private, Adoian re-created himself as a Russian, a cousin
of Maxim Gorky, a student of Kandinsky and a graduate of Brown
University.
</P>
<P>
   His arrival in the United States in 1919 was followed by an
arduous and willful artistic metamorphosis. He took what he needed
from Cezanne, Picasso, Ingres and Goya, often by copying paintings
at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He then forged a fabulously
synthetic yet original style inspired by the art of Miro,
Surrealist automatism, his childhood memories of the Armenian
landscape and two crucial summers spent in the lush countryside of
northern Virginia. As has been widely acknowledged, his paintings
laid the foundation for Abstract Expressionism.
</P>
<P>
   Gorky committed suicide in 1948 after losses that echoed his
youth _ a devastating studio fire, the diagnosis a few weeks later
of advanced cancer, and painful injuries suffered in a car accident
while driving with his dealer, Julien Levy. The last straw was
estrangement from his wife, Agnes, worn down by poverty, the care
of two young children and Gorky's incommunicativeness and jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   Since his death, an understanding of Gorky's achievement has
often been hindered by mistrust, recrimination, feuding and amateur
or partisan writing. Friends and family alike have often
perpetuated Gorky's fictions and sometimes added to them. Despite
such challenges, Gorky biographies are on the verge of becoming an
annual event. Last summer brought ``From a High Place: A Life of
Arshile Gorky,'' by Matthew Spender, a writer and the husband of
Gorky's elder daughter, Maro. An often tedious book that rarely did
justice to Gorky's art, it nonetheless provided the first detailed
and measured account of his epic life, clearing up decades of
mystery and misinformation while revealing some of the complex
psychological pressures and conflicts that drove Gorky.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes a book that makes the shortcomings of Spender's effort
seem relatively minor: Nouritza Matossian's 500-page ``Black Angel:
The Life of Arshile Gorky,'' a shambling, argumentative if
impassioned retelling that slips and slides all over Gorky's life,
often casting it back into the haze while bringing his art weirdly
to life.
</P>
<P>
   Matossian, who lives in London and has written a biography of
the composer Iannis Xenakis, is the first Armenian to attempt a
full-scale biography of Gorky. She conducted lengthy interviews
with his sister, Vartoosh Mooradian, before her death and was able
to read Gorky's letters in the original. She seems to have done a
lot of field work. Her book is studded with personal reminiscences,
some published here for the first time, of people from all phases
of his life. She revisited the places of his childhood and is well
versed in Armenian art.
</P>
<P>
   She approaches her task with a pronounced agenda, which is to
make Gorky the savior of lost Armenian culture, the succor of
Armenian pain. She continually relates his mature work to his
childhood experiences, many of which are conjectural in the first
place; gives lengthy biographical or religious interpretations of
his semiabstract forms; and connects his motifs to the illuminated
manuscripts, carved tombstones and church frescoes of Armenian
culture. (``He did not have to borrow from Africa or the South
Pacific like other artists,'' she writes.)
</P>
<P>
   Matossian's second agenda, which is increasingly irritating as
the book wears on, is to be the savior of Gorky. Thus she discounts
most American critics of the period and glosses over or ignores the
work of other scholars with interests similar to hers, including
Harry Rand's heavily interpretive ``Arshile Gorky: The Implications
of Symbols'' from 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Matossian's strength is a kind of visual reverie. She has an
unusual knack for describing the formal and the physical aspects of
a painting or drawing, the way shapes build and surfaces accrue,
which befits an artist as technically obsessed yet as
improvisational as Gorky. Some of the most engaging passages of
this book are descriptions of paintings, although one tires of the
paucity of corroborating illustrations. She is also good at
creating a sense of the special way artists see, of the way they
look at the landscape and examine other art. When she begins to
ascend into the interpretive stratosphere, one is sometimes willing
to go with her, even against one's better judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Details like facts seem almost beneath Matossian, and her
editors as well. Wilfredo Lam is first Haitian, then Cuban; New
York museums include the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art and the
Whitney Museum of Modern Art. Her relentlessly melodramatic tone
ends up blunting the true and horrible drama of her subject's life.
Her Gorky walks this book like a movie hero _ or the subject of a
Hollywood biography. He looks great and sounds great and casts a
big shadow, but the backgrounds and people around him remain
uniformly vague, his relationships cursory, his inner life
unexplored.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately Matossian herself seems to be the book's main
character. She likes to make inflammatory characterizations in
passing, describing Le Corbusier, for example, as ``a womanizer who
covered architects' plans with doodles of women's protruding
buttocks.'' She seems caught up in old rivalries, like that between
Gorky and Pollock. Lee Krasner's brief appearance during a trip to
Provincetown is footnoted thus: ``Curiously, when Lee Krasner was
interviewed on Gorky she did not mention this holiday with him,
perhaps because she was not with Pollock at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere, the immense hurt of Gorky's life and afterlife,
surrogate for the larger Armenian tragedy, is furiously protected.
At a party where Gorky danced, as he often did, ``A photograph was
snapped so writers could lampoon him later for pretending to be a
peasant dancer.'' By the end of this book, Matossian's agenda has
become an enormous chip on her own shoulder, one that, for all her
enormous effort, does Gorky more harm than good.

CINCINNATI BOOKSTORE LOVER VISITS TEXAS _ FOR HALF PRICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALYSON WARD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Matt Tauber planned the classic road trip. Or, more accurately,
a road trip with the classics.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old Cincinnati stockbroker flew to Texas last month
and spent a week driving all over the state _ to visit bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   Tauber collects old and hard-to-find books, and Half Price Books
is one of his favorite haunts at home in Ohio. On the Half Price
Web site (www.halfpricebooks.com), he discovered that 28 of the
chain's 63 stores are located in Texas. (Twelve are in the Fort
Worth-Dallas area.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea flashed in my brain _ what if I went to Texas, took a
week and went to all of them?'' Tauber says. ``I had vacation time
and didn't have a plan.''
</P>
<P>
   So he plotted a course through Texas, visiting four or five
stores each day. Half Price has locations in the Metroplex, in
Houston and San Antonio, in Austin, Bryan and Corpus Christi. The
bookstore chain started in Dallas 27 years ago, and since then it
has expanded into eight other states. Tauber says he visits one of
the Cincinnati stores at least once a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually buy at least one thing _ it could be 25 cents or
$20,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Tauber keeps a mental list of what he's looking for, but he also
keeps an eye out for the unexpected at the Half Price stores, which
offer an ever-changing hodgepodge of new and used items.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of potluck,'' Tauber says. ``Every store is
different. You can go in one month, and the next month you go in
and they have different stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Tauber has his own hodgepodge of books; his collection contains
a few hundred books, and they're mostly stored in boxes in his
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a backlog of stuff I haven't read, so this (vacation)
probably isn't the best idea,'' he says, carrying his selections to
the checkout counter at Fort Worth's Ridgmar store.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't leave Texas empty-handed. Tauber mailed his finds home
in two boxes _ more than 100 books. He found old Peanuts books by
Charles Schulz and some other comics, books about the Beatles and
Bob Dylan, history books, CDs and ``obscure comedy albums,''
including a Groucho Marx radio show.
</P>
<P>
   The grand total for Tauber's hundred-or-so books: barely more
than $250. Not bad for a week of shopping. (Of course, he did
receive a 15 percent discount _ a friendly Texas welcome arranged
by the Half Price corporate office.)
</P>
<P>
   Tauber sent a letter to the corporate office in Dallas,
announcing his plans for a Half Price vacation. He arranged to pose
for a photo with employees of every Texas store he visited; he's
including the photos in a scrapbook that chronicles his trip.
</P>
<P>
   With store employees (and a handful of reporters) anticipating
his arrival throughout the state, Tauber's solo trip through Texas
wasn't exactly unnoticed or anonymous. But Tauber was a little
amused by the attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's nice for people to take an interest in your
vacation,'' he says.

   DAYTON, Ohio - Vary the basic green bean salad with these
additions. Toss just before serving with a simple vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Top with crumbled feta cheese and coarsely ground black
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Peel and cut crunchy jicama into batons _ shaped like the

and a light oil.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Arrange equal parts of cooked shell beans such as lima beans,
cranberry beans or green beans side by side on a platter. Snip
parsley and fresh chives over the top (in August, scatter the
blossoms of garlic chives over the beans).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cook a pound each of green beans and wax beans. Cut a
quarter-pound of smoked mozzarella or smoked gouda into thin strips
and toss with the beans.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Toss the beans with several handfuls of halved, pitted
Kalamata olives.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Add a pint of halved cherry tomatoes to a pound of beans. Top

   MIDEAST-TALKS (Thurmont, Md.) _ Ledeall: In the verdant hills of
Maryland, far from the arid land that is the object of their bitter
dispute, the Israeli and Palestinian leaders began their fateful
peace summit at Camp David on Tuesday with the far-reaching, most
think improbable, goal of ending their 52-year-old conflict. On the
first day of an open-ended, secluded meeting, President Clinton
ushered the leaders, Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, into the presidential retreat
where he hopes that the chemistry of the place and the moment can
induce a spirit of ``principled compromise'' that yields a
substantive peace agreement. By Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-CLINTON (Thurmont, Md.) _ During President Clinton's
seven years in office, there is no world leader who has journeyed
more often to the White House than Yasser Arafat. Thirteen times,
the Palestinian leader has met there the American president.
Starting Tuesday, the White House will see whether that investment
can be made to pay in a peace settlement. Administration officials
say Clinton is banking on his relationship to make the critical
difference at Camp David as Arafat and Prime Minister Ehud Barak of
Israel weigh the difficult compromises required for an agreement to
end decades of hostility and violence. By Jane Perlez.

<P>
   BOSNIA-MEMORIAL (Srebrenica, Bosnia-Herzegovina) _ Sitting on
the grass weeping, her legs folded beneath her, Tima Mehmedovic,
pointed to the spot where she had last seen her husband. Five years
ago to the day, he was among more than 7,000 men from Srebrenica
who were taken away by attacking Serbian forces and killed in the
worst massacre Europe has witnessed since World War II. On Tuesday
she was among thousands of Muslim women and a few dozen men,
relatives of the dead and missing, who returned to the site for an
emotionally charged memorial service. They came in fleets of buses,
under heavy police protection, many of them, like Mehmedovic,
returning for the first time to their hometown since those fateful
days in 1995, at the height of the war in Bosnia, when they were
separated from their menfolk and herded on to buses to be deported.

 &HT;    Armstrong maintains hold as Tour de France finishes 11th stage
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   REVEL, France _ With eight support riders from his U.S. Postal
Service team forming a shield, Tour de France leader Lance
Armstrong maintained first place Tuesday as the race ended its 11th
stage.
</P>
<P>
   The cyclists rode 135.4 miles from Bagneres-de-Bigorre to Revel,
through thunderstorms and sunshine, past the lush green fields of
southern France. By afternoon's end, Armstrong stood on the podium
for a second day, wearing the yellow jersey of the leader,
accepting his bouquet of yellow flowers, and kissing the cheeks of
his presenters the customary three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were nice to me in the peloton (group of riders),''
Armstrong said of his protectors. ``I didn't see that many people.
It was windy, and it rained on and off. So I stayed in front most
of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, defending champion of Austin, Texas, finished 24th
Tuesday, 5 minutes and 5 seconds behind stage winner Erik Dekker.
Jan Ullrich, the 1997 Tour champion who is considered Armstrong's
main rival, finished just ahead of him in 24th, but with the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   The race ends July 23 in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong finished the day much as he started, staying 4:14
ahead of Ullrich and 5:10 over Christophe Moreau. Marc Wauters was
fourth at 5:18, with Peter Luttenberger fifth at 5:21.
</P>
<P>
   Dekker's victory, which he celebrated with a flurry of air
punches, did little but give him another chance to step atop the
podium. It was his second stage win of the Tour, but despite
picking up more than five minutes on Armstrong, he remained in 47th
place, 20:40 out of the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's stage up the summit of Hautacam basically decided the
contenders for the Tour. Because Armstrong finished second in that
stage and so far ahead of the other top riders, he was able to zoom
from 16th overall to first.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the European media declared the race for the final
yellow jersey as over, describing Ullrich as shaken by Armstrong's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Marco Pantani, the 1998 Tour champion, said after Armstrong
donned yellow: ``Armstrong is on another planet.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, however, did not celebrate his yellow jersey status
Monday night as he tried to play down the thought that he had this
marathon of an event clinched at the halfway mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any champagne,'' he said. ``If I'm lucky enough
to win the championship in Paris, then maybe I'll have some
champagne.
</P>
<P>
   He said his climb up the Hautacam did not physically tire him
for Tuesday's stage, which with its relatively rolling terrain was
opposite of Monday's steep route in the Pyrenees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't sleep very well,'' Armstrong said. ``It was just one
day in the mountains. I didn't feel fatigued like I did last year.
The fatigue definitely will be there in the Alps. That's the
majority of the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Today is the first off day for the Tour, with riders traveling
198 miles to Carpentras for the start of Thursday's stage 12. The
12th stage ends with a summit climb to Le Mont Ventoux, more than
2,000 feet above sea level.

 &HT;    Now is the time to vary salad choices
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - If life was fair and just, July would be the
salad days of summer.
</P>
<P>
   But as any backyard gardener knows, Mother Nature is contrary.
About the time the temperature wilts the appetite, when a nice
green salad sounds like supper, the tender leaf lettuce of June
begins to bolt and turn bitter.
</P>
<P>
   Even sources of salad greens at local farm markets dry up. The
frustrated cook may be tempted to go back to the supermarket _ but
supermarket greens from distant parts of the continent are what we
are stuck with for the rest of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   There still are salads to be made from the local vegetable
bounty. Corn salad is an easy and favorite option once the first
taste of corn on the cob has been sated. Tomatoes and cucumbers
partner in a classic Greek chopped salad with olives and feta
cheese. Summer squash, green and yellow, make a colorful salad.
</P>
<P>
   But when you want a green salad, the best choice is a green bean
salad. We've got enough variations on the basic salad to carry you
through every weekend until September, when good local salad greens
return.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the basics:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Buy small to medium beans, not big ``beany'' beans.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rinse in cold water. Remove the stem ends, but don't bother
with the thin tail. That's just doubling your work, and it's
perfectly edible.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cook the beans in an abundance of well-salted water, about a
teaspoon of salt for a pound of beans.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cook just until the beans are tender crisp. They will continue
to cook a bit while cooling.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Drain and spread the beans out flat to cool (California
cooking guru Alice Waters insists the beans retain more flavor this
way, rather than cooling the beans under cold water, a favorite
chef's trick).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make the vinaigrette ahead of time, but don't toss the beans
with the dressing until the last minute because the acid (the lemon
juice or vinegar) in the dressing will discolor the beans. However,
the dressing can be combined with other ingredients, such as
tomatoes, onion, peppers, shell beans, olives, etc.
</P>
<P>
   I like to cut corn from the cob and add it to a green bean
salad. It adds a touch of sweetness. Ditto red bell peppers, which
also provide color contrast. The red bell peppers available now are
not locally field-grown _ though some hothouse specimens turn up at
farm markets.
</P>
<P>
   SUMMER GREEN BEAN SALAD
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 to 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   1 pound small green beans
</P>
<P>
   1 cup corn kernels cut from 2 ears
</P>
<P>
   1 red bell pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup homemade vinaigrette (recipe follows)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup slivered basil, or small leaves of lemon basil
</P>
<P>
   Cook the beans in a large pot of salted boiling water for 4-5
minutes, until cooked but still crisp. Drain and spread out to dry.
</P>
<P>
   If the corn is very fresh, young and tender, it need not be
cooked. Otherwise, place the kernels in a small strainer and blanch
for a minute in boiling water. Drain well.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the pepper into quarters and remove seeds and ribs. Cut off
the top and bottom to square up the edges, then slice into batons
the same shape as the beans.
</P>
<P>
   The beans and bell pepper slices can be combined in a salad bowl
and topped with the corn ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   Just before serving, toss with the vinaigrette and basil.
</P>
<P>
   Proportions of vinegar and oil in a vinaigrette depend on the
acidity of the vinegar and the quality of the oil. Extra virgin
olive oil is best, though not everyone has developed a taste for
it. Light olive oils are preferable to vegetable oils. Vinegars
vary from red and white wine vinegar to balsamic, and my everyday
favorite is sherry vinegar. A little Dijon mustard helps emulsify
the dressing.
</P>
<P>
   VINAIGRETTE
</P>
<P>
   Makes 1/2 cup
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons wine vinegar, preferably sherry vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic, halved
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon Dijon mustard, optional
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Combine the vinegar, garlic, salt, pepper and mustard, if using,
in a small container and shake well. Add the oil and shake again to
blend.
</P>
<P>
   You can make corn salad with corn cut from leftover corn on the
cob it if has been lightly cooked. Or you can cut the kernels off
the cob and drop into boiling water and blanch for a minute. Or do
as some corn lovers do _ use raw kernels in this salad.
</P>
<P>
   CORN SALAD WITH LIME DRESSING
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 to 6 serving
</P>
<P>
   2 cups fresh corn kernels, cut from 4-5 ears
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup sliced, pitted Kalamata olives
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup chopped red bell pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup halved cherry tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoons snipped garlic chives or regular chives
</P>
<P>
   1/2 large avocado, diced
</P>
<P>
   lime dressing (recipe follows)
</P>
<P>

MCDONALD'S IS REINVENTING ITSELF TO RECOUP LOST MARKET SHARE

   BURLESON, Texas _ Diners in Plano eat Big Macs while sitting on
mahogany-stained wood chairs under crystal chandeliers, one of
which hangs from a faux gold-leaf replica of a 17th-century
medallion in a French chateau.
</P>
<P>
   In Burleson, customers can do their banking or grocery shopping
online or play computer games as they scarf down a burger and fries
while sitting on burgundy-colored seats, surrounded by wood
paneling accented with Texas limestone.
</P>
<P>
   Did somebody say this is McDonald's?
</P>
<P>
   Those two variations on the McDonald's theme are part of the
chain's collaboration with its approximately 5,000 franchisees
worldwide, said McDonald's USA President Allan Feldman.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want to do is to give them the freedom and the tools
to be able to tailor their business to best fit the needs of that
community,'' he said on a recent tour of those two Metroplex
stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``In total over the last 18 months, the McDonald's system has
spent over $400 million reinventing its systems,'' Feldman said,
citing combined outlays by the company and franchisees nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest fast-food chain has been scrambling for
years to regain lost U.S. market share _ and add more.
</P>
<P>
   In January, McDonald's stock dropped 10 percent when the company
said earnings this year will be lower than analysts' estimates,
despite a 40 percent rise in fourth-quarter 1999 profits.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after nine consecutive quarters of increased sales,
McDonald's is trying to cement those gains and build on them. It
has bought into three other chains, Chipotle for Mexican burritos
and tacos, Donatos for pizza and Italian cuisine, and Boston Market
for chicken and homestyle meals. It also invested in Food.com, an
online meal deliverer.
</P>
<P>
   And the company is focusing on its namesake restaurants. Feldman
talks about ambience and improving service, new menu items and
changing the food preparation system for the entire chain of 27,000
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's is adding items for aging baby boomers and other
health-conscious consumers, including three salads and the Fruit 'N
Yogurt Parfaits, two chicken sandwiches and Breakfast Bagels.
</P>
<P>
   Some things, however won't change, Feldman said. ``A Big Mac is
a Big Mac.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Big Macs are made has, however, changed, McDonald's
officals said. Gone are the premade sandwiches and other menu items
in heated bins. Now the patties come hot off a two-sided griddle,
the buns are toasted and the sandwiches are assembled only when
they're ordered, said Dave Hamilton, vice president for the
Southwest region, which covers a 385-store territory.
</P>
<P>
   The approach is new to McDonald's, but not to Sonic and some
other fast-food chains.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's has tried previously to become more competitive, not
always successfully. The McLean burger, for example, was a failure.
And a corporate-driven national price war _ the 55-cent Big Mac and
breakfast deals in 1997 _ turned into a fiasco when franchisees
rebelled and refused to cut prices.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts at A.G. Edwards say it's too early to judge McDonald's
latest strategic redirection, which began in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has high hopes for it, an optimism that some
local franchisees share.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've moved away from a centralized approach to the
business,'' said John Charlesworth, McDonald's USA's Midwest
Division president.
</P>
<P>
   The centralized price controls also changed in 1997. ``We don't
control prices. Our owner-operators do,'' Feldman said, adding that
the only nationally advertised price is the $1.99 Happy Meal.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas-based franchisee Ed Bailey, co-owner/operator of the
Plano store and 30 others in the Metroplex, said the people at
McDonald's headquarters lost sight of their mission for a time but
have more than regained it.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth-based franchisee Joe Jasper said, ``From my view,
anecdotally, the relationship between McDonald's Corp. and its
franchisees is at its highest level of recent history.''
</P>
<P>
   The cyber offerings in Burleson are the brainchild of Jasper and
his brother, computer systems specialist Gene Jasper. ``It's my
personal view of what I see McDonald's could be in the future,''
Joe Jasper said.
</P>
<P>
   Sales are up 25 percent to 30 percent or more at Jasper's
Burleson restaurant, which reopened about two months ago, and at
three others he has similarly upgraded, he said. ``We have covered
our costs over the last 12 months,'' Jasper said. He is upgrading
another restaurant in the Cultural District in Forth Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The McMagination concept, which includes assortedcomputer games
and may include Internet links, is evolving, Jasper said. But other
franchisees from as far away as Australia, Japan and South America
have visited to examine it, Jasper said. So far, about 16 have
similar formats, which may eventually go chainwide.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said the year-old Plano store has generated 60 percent
more sales than projected. The restaurant's dessert sales have
doubled since the McTreat Dessert Center for walk-up orders went
into operation, he said.

<P>
   GERGIEV-BALLET (St. Petersberg, Russia) _ Every year, around the
summer solistice, this faded imperial city steps back into the
limelight. On those long white nights, when the sun dips out of
sight for only a few hours, crowds gather on the banks of the Neva
River, even shabby hotels fill up with tourists and at the
venerable Maryinsky (formerly Kirov) Theater, the seats at the
``Stars of the White nights'' festival are taken up by rich patrons
from all over the world. This is also the one time when Valeri
Gergiev, one of the world's most sought after conductors who also
happens to be theater's artistic director, bringa his star quality
home to this gritty city with a pretty face. By Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   BOLSHOI-BALLET (New York) _ Power and passion: The Bolshoi
Ballet's dancing has been synonymous with these qualities, making
it a company unlike any other. Virtually sold out for its
appearances at Lincoln Center Festival 2000 this week, as was its
recent five-city U.S. tour, the fabled company from Moscow returns
to New York for the first time in 10 years, and with its potent
mystique intact. Nonetheless, as Aleksei Fadeyechev says, ``It is a
different company now. Time chooses dancers for its own time.''
Fadeyechev, who was one of the company's stars and Nina
Ananiashvili's partner here in 1990, was named the ballet troupe's
artistic director in 1998 under Vladimir Vasiliev, the superstar
who was given the new and double post of general and artistic
director of the entire Bolshoi Theater in 1995. By Anna Kisselgoff.

   &UR; FILM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CHUCK&AMP;BUCK-FILM (Undated) _ Insinuating its way into a summer of
movies of negligible ambiguity comes one of the major chew bones of
this year's Sundance Film Festival, ``Chuck and Buck.'' The movie,
scheduled to open July 14, is about boyhood friends who
re-encounter one another after many years. It's a movie that
careens into one cringe-inducing circumstance after another: the
sexuality of children, the old relationship that will not die, the
overweening confidence of jerks, the cruelty of the panicked, the
geek who will not go away. And it's a comedy! By Jamie Malanowski.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   COMMIE-COMEDY-FILM (Undated) _ The phrase ``Communist musical
comedy'' may sound like an oxymoron, but even the officially
achieved utopia of no-longer-extant East Germany required a few
measures of utopian song-and-dance. ``Hot Summer,'' the teenage
musical that was the DDR's second-highest-grossing film in 1968, is
not quite socialism a-go-go but it's an entertaining artifact
nonetheless. By J. Hoberman.

   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ZAKS-THEATER (New York) _ Sitting in the cool darkness of the
theater balcony where ``The Man Who Came to Dinner'' was about to
start previews, Jerry Zaks did not come across as a burdened man.
Yet if his experiences of the last few years have not succeeded in
darkening the Broadway director, they have certainly left him more
defended. And no wonder. Zaks, 53, is coming off a bad run of
flops, including last season's ``Epic Proportions'' and the 1999
``Civil War.'' But one could also argue that Zaks has not so much
failed his more recent projects, as they have failed him. By Robin
Pogrebin.

<P>
   &UR; MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SCHUBERT-MUSIC (Undated) _ Christopher Gibbs begins his brief
new book on Schubert (``The Life of Schubert,'' Cambridge
University Press) by avoiding any claim to the ``true'' man and
composer. He will, in his words, ``recount what can be reliably
documented and examine some of the persistent images.'' Knowing the
chronologies and the anecdotes from friends is a help, but they do
not tell us who Schubert was. Indeed, the truth of Schubert is that
he knows more about us than we about him. Some creative people are
this big. By Bernard Holland.
</P>
<P>
   LEHRER-MUSIC (Santa Cruz, Calif.) _ His songs are the stuff of
your fondest adolescent imagination, subversive send-ups of the Boy
Scouts, religion, lynching, college cheerleading, pollution,
plagiarism, prudishness. They are twisted, erudite parodies of the
perverse. So it comes as a bit of a surprise on meeting Tom Lehrer,
the Harvard-trained mathematician-cum-musician that the disc jockey
Barry Hansen has called ``the most brilliant song satirist ever
recorded,'' to learn that he seems a lot more like the gently
whimsical voice behind his children's songs for the television
series ``The Electric Company,'' than the sick-genius author of
``Poisoning Pigeons in the Park.'' By Todd S. Purdum.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-PERFORMANCE (Undated) _ There are nights in the
theater, the opera house, the symphony hall that earn the
designation legendary. We've all heard about them, or perhaps, with
luck, even caught a few. And that, of course, is the point. Beyond
their momentary transcendence, legendary nights linger largely
because of their evanescence. What becomes a legend most is the
very fact that you had to be there. But what about the Internet?
Can the Webcam actually make every live performance a widely
shared, even permanently preserved, event? By Barry Singer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MAURY-TV (Undated) _ ``Entertainment Weekly,'' this season's
``biggest success story'' in syndicated daytime television. The
ratings are up some 19 percent since last year, and it now
occasionally outpoints the popular ``Rosie O'Donnell Show'' in the
same time slot here in New York. This ``daytime yakker'' has got
the ``big mo,'' they say. How did ``Maury'' do it? By Jeff
MacGregor.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART/PHOTOGRAPHY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MEDIA-PHOTOGRAPHY (New York) _ Now for the bad news: good news
is on vacation. Permanently. In the news media, anyway, ``no news
is good news'' just might be read as ``there is no such thing as
good news,'' something local television has been trying to convince
viewers of for years. That goes double for news photography: the
news photographs you remember are likely to compose a litany of
grief and terror, from the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald to the
execution of a Vietcong prisoner on the streets of Saigon to the
dragging of a dead American soldier's body through the streets of
Somalia. Pictures of those three events won Pulitzer Prizes. A show
called ``The Pulitzer Prize Photographs: Capture the Moment,'' at
the Newseum/NY in midtown Manhattan through Sept. 23, reinforces
the widespread impression that news tends to be violent and morbid.

<P>
   &UR; ARCHITECTURE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   HEJDUK-ARCHITECTURE (Undated) _ Though John Hejduk was little
known outside the world of architecture, his influence exceeded
that of many of its most prominent figures. His death last week, at
71, leaves a profound emptiness _ a quality that, as it happens,
Hejduk often reflected on in his work. Like many gifted architects,
he was a contradictory figure: a solitary artist who chose to work
in a highly social form of art. But he had a particular way of
living out the contradiction. By Herbert Muschamp.

 &HT;    Here comes the bride... she's wired
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Meet Peter and Melanie. They are getting married Sept.
6, and you're invited.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, anybody who watches NBC's ``Today'' show is invited.
In fact, anybody with Internet access can log onto the ``Today''
Web site (www.today.msnbc.com) and decide exactly what kind of
wedding Peter and Melanie will have.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ginsberg, Melanie Nelson and millions of amateur wedding
planners around the world are part of a special segment called
``Today ties The Knot.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Zucker, executive producer of ``Today,'' said allowing
millions of viewers to have a part in the planning of a real
couple's wedding via the Web, then to see it happen right there at
Rockefeller Plaza in New York, would be a groundbreaking event. He
said the combination of the Web and TV can add an entirely new
dimension to the way people plan weddings.
</P>
<P>
   Peter and Melanie's interactive wedding adventure is an amazing
combination of old and new media. ``Today'' show viewers seem to be
an incredibly wired bunch who cast 130,000 votes to decide where
co-anchor Matt Lauer should go on the last stop of his
round-the-world stunt last May.
</P>
<P>
   Even more voters than that have been coming to the ``Today'' Web
site to help plan the couple's wedding. It's bad enough having
everyone from Mom to Aunt Gladys right down to the woman at the
Starbucks counter offering wedding advice. Think about Peter and
Melanie, who have a couple of hundred thousand people they don't
know deciding whether Melanie should go with the Carolina Herrera
or Paloma Blanca wedding gown.
</P>
<P>
   At least they don't have to invite them to the reception.
</P>
<P>
   Back on June 20, ``Today'' and wedding Web site TheKnot.com
(www.theknot.com) formed a 12-week partnership to choose a couple
and help them plan their wedding on live TV, along with the wedding
experts at TheKnot. Each week, viewers can tune in to watch Peter
and Melanie get tips on planning their wedding and then vote on
what one of the most significant days in their lives will be like.
</P>
<P>
   On the July 5 show, the giggling, hand-holding couple were shown
the wedding rings as selected by viewers, who cast more than
100,000 votes on the morning show's Web site. Next came the
opportunity to vote for a wedding gown and tuxedo. Peter seemed
concerned that no cummerbunds were involved, but Carley Roney,
editor-in-chief of TheKnot.com, assured Peter that he'd be hip
enough for his own wedding and possibly even the Oscars in whatever
tux viewers chose for him.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the couple has agreed to go along with voters'
choices without a word of complaint. Clearly this is every
mother-of-the-bride's dream. And a lot of these mothers, even moms
who don't use the Web, are getting vicarious thrills by asking
wired friends to vote to give Peter and Melanie the wedding their
own unruly daughters didn't get.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for TheKnot says people are fascinated with Peter
and Melanie's interactive wedding because most have been to
weddings or endured the trauma of trying to plan one. Now they'd
like to do it right.
</P>
<P>
   That's one way of looking at it, but there could be more to it
than that. This type of reality TV is tailor-made for Internet
tie-ins. See the real people. See their dilemmas. Vote to help them
solve their problems, or vote them out of the limelight. What if
viewers had been able to decide if Puck got voted off ``Real
World'' or which ``Survivor'' cast member gets booted off the
island each week?
</P>
<P>
   However, you won't find anything that drastic or weird on the
``Today'' show, and that's just fine. This is a kinder, gentler way
to watch real people get on with their lives. Peter and Melanie are
real people (read all about them on the MSNBC Web site), and they
really are engaged to be married. They were selected from more than
1,000 couples who wanted to get married on the show, by a panel of
130,000 viewers who went to the Web site and voted for them.
</P>
<P>
   And the Web site makes this little slice of reality TV so
interesting. Not only do we get to plan the couple's wedding, we
also get to watch them get married outfitted with all the wedding
gear we've selected for them.
</P>
<P>
   We'll have to wait until September to find out what Peter and
Melanie really think of all this. Over the next 12 weeks, we'll be
able to vote on everything from who caters the reception to where
they go on their honeymoon.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are probably a few decisions Peter and Melanie will
make for themselves that we won't get to vote on _ and that's
probably the way it ought to be.

 &HT;    Don't be afraid to buy online, but take precautions _ and never
use a debit card.
 &HT;    By Mary Jo DiLonardo
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For some people, shopping online is akin to handing
their credit card to a shifty-looking stranger and inviting him to
have at it.
</P>
<P>
   It's scary, stupid and they're just not going to do it.
</P>
<P>
   While experts say you should take precautions when delving into
the wonderful world of e-commerce, they also agree it's often no
more risky than buying something the old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are all concerned about Internet security think
nothing about giving their credit card to a waiter who disappears
with it into the back room for 10 minutes,'' says computer author
Mark Minasi, whose most recent book is ``The Software Conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The old advice that we got from our grandfathers _ don't use
credit cards, period _ doesn't really apply in this day and age,''
says Rob Clyde, vice president of security management for Axent
Technologies, a Rockville, Md.-based information security firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you use a true credit card number, not a debit card number,
you're already pretty protected by Visa or MasterCard or American
Express, so your liability is $50 maximum. That already leaves you
at a starting point where you don't have to be all that worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Which doesn't mean don't worry at all. There are some important
measures you should take before keying in that long list of numbers
and expiration date.
</P>
<P>
   First, be sure to use a credit card, not a debit card, when
shopping online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Debit cards are much more risky than are conventional credit
cards. You should never, ever use a debit card on the Web,''
cautions George Hellyer, senior consultant for Janus Associates, a
Stamford, Conn.-based firm that specializes in information
security.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone gets your debit card number, they can drain all
your bank accounts. With a credit card, you're protected after the
first $50 of fraudulent use. You are not guaranteed that protection
if you use your debit card. All your savings can be wiped out. It's
a very frightening thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, credit card in hand, be sure you shop only on secure
connections. That's where sites use encryption, which basically
scrambles the information as it goes careening around the Internet.
In order to confirm the site is safe, look for that little padlock
on the bottom of your browser. If it's locked, the site is secure.
If it's open, all bets are off. You can also configure your browser
to offer a prompt that alerts you to the fact that you are entering
a secure connection.
</P>
<P>
   Advises Minasi: ``If the lock's not there, don't send the credit
card, period. That's just too easy to steal.''
</P>
<P>
   There are various levels of encryption a site can offer _
usually ranging from 56 bits to 128 bits. The higher the number,
the better. But don't lose sleep over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically what you want to see is over 96 or 128 bits,'' says
Clyde. ``But if it's a legitimate company, 56 is OK. It's important
to put the risk in the proper context. If it's a company you'd do
business with over the phone, it's probably safe to do business
over the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're concerned, you can update your browser to a higher
level of encryption. But even if you're using 128, a site could
still be encrypting at 56, says Minasi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does this mean you should worry? At 56, the chance would still
be one in one with about 19 zeroes after it,'' he says, laughing.
``I don't know of any significant credit card fraud on the Internet
involving people punching in credit cards on secure sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it's not always easy to find out at what level a
company is encrypting. Sometimes it's in the privacy statement.
Often, you have to send an e-mail asking at what level the company
encrypts.
</P>
<P>
   Still worried? You can configure your browser to accept only
sites with 128-bit encryption, so lower-level sites won't even be
accessible. That'll show 'em!
</P>
<P>
   Besides the secure connection, there are other things to
consider before.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't rely on a professional-looking Web site as proof
that it's a reliable company,'' warns Holly Cherico, spokeswoman
for the Council of Better Business Bureaus, the umbrella
organization for the nation's 132 Better Business Bureaus.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have the skill, you can make a very sophisticated Web
site look like it's backed by a Fortune 500 company.''
</P>
<P>
   If it's a well-known site _ like amazon.com _ or a company with
a reputable physical presence _ like Sears _ your worries should be
few.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 1, know who you are buying from,'' advises Hellyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's someplace you've never heard of, try to find more
information. Do a search to see what you can find. Ask for
references. If someone is going to install windows for you or
aluminum siding, you ask for references, so it's the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, be sure there's a way to contact the company offline with
a listed phone number or address. If the only way you can reach the
company is via e-mail and the company disappears, you have no other
way of trying to track it down.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've trusted a site with your credit card data, question
what they are going to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of companies store credit card information, which
troubles me,'' admits Minasi. ``AOL keeps your credit card number
on file even if you get rid of the service. There are only 5
million people who work for that company. I'm sure no one would
think about stealing that information!''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies give you the option to let them keep your credit
card info to save the hassle next time you shop. You'll get a
prompt along the lines of, ``Would you like us to remember this
credit card so you don't have to enter it again later?'' Then the
choice is yours.
</P>
<P>
   LOOK AT PRIVACY STATEMENT
</P>
<P>
   To find if the company stores your credit card information,
check the privacy statement. If there is no privacy statement, just
flat-out don't do business with the company, Minasi says. If they
store the information without giving you a choice, take action, he
advises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Send them a politely worded e-mail saying, `Give me the choice
like other vendors do,' '' he says. ``Don't just walk away. Tell
them it's an inappropriate lack of protection of your privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if you trust the company name and are using a secure
connection, limit the information you are willing to provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never provide your Social Security number or date of birth
over the Internet,'' says Hellyer. ``If they have your name, your
date of birth and your Social Security number, they can counterfeit
your identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the best of intentions, a company just has no business
having that information, says Shirley Rooker, president of Call For
Action, a nonprofit consumer helpline based in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're doing a transaction online, that company has no
right to ask you for your Social Security number, your mother's
maiden name, any information like that,'' she says. ``If they're
asking you all that information, they're collecting it for some
reason, and you just shouldn't give it. That's a sure sign you
should go someplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, click on the privacy statement for more information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does the company post a privacy policy about how it's going to
use the information it collects about you?'' questions Rooker.
``Are they going to share it with a third party and, if so, how do
you feel about it?''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes when you type in information on a Web site _ most
often a password _ asterisks pop up on your screen instead of the
letters or numbers you are typing. Don't be lulled into believing
this is encryption. The company is merely protecting your privacy
from someone who may be looking at your screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``That only protects you from people peeking over your shoulder
while you're typing,'' says Minasi. ``It doesn't save you from
people on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   REPORTING FRAUD ON THE NET
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the National Consumers League reported a 38 percent
increase in the number of e-complaints, with more than 10,000
reported. Here's where you can go if you think you've been had:
</P>
<P>
   Better Business Bureau, www.bbb.org _ In addition to awarding
more than 5,000 sites the BBB Reliability Seal online, the consumer
organization has bestowed its Privacy Seal on more than 50 sites.
You can search those vendors and also report e-commerce problems
online at the BBB's site.
</P>
<P>
   Call For Action, www.callforaction.org _ This nonprofit consumer
advocacy group allows you to report problems and helps you solve
them. You can also call locally 678-422-8466.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Fraud Complaint Center, www.ifccfbi.gov/ _ This is
a partnership between the FBI and the National White Collar Crime
Center through which consumers can report suspected cases of
e-fraud.

 &HT;    Online newspaper access facilitates getting the facts
 &HT;    By Anne Meyers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I admit that when it comes to information gathering, I
have a personal bias toward newspapers. Online access to
out-of-town and local news stories is available with the click of a
mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Last month my father was making copies at his local Kinko's
store. He was well inside the store when a Ford Probe hopped the
curb, plowed through the store window and ended up on top of him.
</P>
<P>
   The police called my mother to meet them at the emergency room.
My mother called me from the hospital and told what she knew, which
was just not enough.
</P>
<P>
   I searched Web sites of their hometown media outlets and found
short news stories about the accident. These sites provided more
detail about the type of car and the driver's status.
</P>
<P>
   Living far from my family removes me from emergency room trips
and important day-to-day involvement. I miss being part of their
chaos, and I do what I can to stay tuned. I kept in contact with my
mother by telephone during the day of my father's accident and the
next morning headed back to my computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we find a picture of Grandpa on the Internet now?'' my
7-year-old asked. ``Will there be more stories about him?''
</P>
<P>
   My daughter and I logged on and found a newspaper article with a
photograph. The few new details helped us feel more plugged in.
</P>
<P>
   The next day we traveled to see my father. My mother showed us a
videotape of the television news. There were images of the
accident's aftermath. Real life is strange sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   I am curious. I am interested. And I am detail-hungry.
</P>
<P>
   The media (in its haste to get the story out) can sometimes be
wrong with the details, but they work to keep the public informed
at a fast and stressful pace.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of my father's accident, his age changed from story
to story, and the initial radio reports of the severity of his
injuries frightened my mother on her drive to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   I still find this source to be more accurate than the usual path
that these stories take in person-to-person communication. In my
circle of neighbors and friends, there have been many stories that
made headlines.
</P>
<P>
   I try to read the story as soon as it hits the conversation
rounds so I understand better what the gossip is about. Then I feel
informed and may even be able to be helpful in some way.
</P>
<P>
   As Web time becomes as commonplace as couch time, I am finding
more people turning to the Internet in ways that I do.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, my friend Lisa's aunt was killed in a terrible car
accident that took four lives. Lisa checked online resources near
the accident scene including The Augusta Chronicle
(www.augustachronicle.com) for details. She wanted to know more.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, when Lisa and I talked, the story had not been posted
to the newspaper's site. We searched headlines from other sources
including First Headlines (www.1stheadlines.com), a compilation of
stories from hundreds of news sources.
</P>
<P>
   There are Web sites with links to newspaper sites. Newspapers
Online! (www.newspapers.com) is another free service, helping
people find newspaper links all around the world. Another old
favorite is the Internet Public Library, hosted by the School of
Information at the University of Michigan
(www.ipl.org/reading/news/).
</P>
<P>
   There are many large and small news organizations sharing
stories online. CNN (www.cnn.com) and MSNBC (www.msnbc
</P>
<P>
   .com) are just a few of the broadcast entities informing us
round-the-clock on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   For the stories that do not hit the big time, check the local
newspapers online for a chance to learn more.
</P>
<P>
   Many sites offer new and old stories for free; others charge for
access to archives.

 &HT;    Getting rid of Spam takes a lot of effort
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I am at wit's end. I have no idea how I got on this list, but I
get daily junk from support (at)justsaywow.com that I do not want.
There is a lengthy address at the bottom of the message on how to
``unsubscribe,'' but I've been told that trying to unsubscribe will
result in being put on even more lists. Is there a way to
unsubscribe?
</P>
<P>
   _ John R. Adams, Loganville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Spam, or junk mail, is unwanted or unsolicited e-mail, the
electronic variety of what can pile up in your mailbox at home. It
can be annoying, invasive and downright difficult to get
unsubscribed from.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: It's also giving a lunch meat a bad name. For an overview
on spam, surf to www.mindworkshop.com
</P>
<P>
   /alchemy/nospam.html.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: There are sites that send e-mail telling you how to
unsubscribe. Then, once you respond, they've got you. Lots of sites
are doing it. They send out thousands of messages telling you about
their service. They tell you how to unsubscribe, as if you already
belong.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Pretty sneaky. Once you reply, they know your e-mail
address is legit and they zero in.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: One way to find out who is behind these sites is to go to
Network Solutions Web site at www.networksolutions.com/. This is
the place to register a domain name and to check who owns a domain
name. I clicked on the WHOIS Lookup link. Then I popped the
``justsaywow.com'' domain in the look-up search field.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: We found the name of the person administering the site,
an address, a phone number, his e-mail account and who is
maintaining his Web site servers. Check it out for yourself. Be
aware that sometimes this information is outdated, but it's a good
place to start. Anyone can run this kind of check. Perhaps a chat
with the administrator?
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Another avenue is to talk to your ISP. Many ISPs offer spam
protection. You also may be able to run a local filter on your
e-mail account that deletes these incoming messages so you never
have to be bothered with them again.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: If all else fails, there are a few online companies that
keep an eye on spammers. Look at www.mail-abuse.org/rbl
</P>
<P>
   /reporting.html or www.abuse.net/.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Readers:
</P>
<P>
   One of our first columns dealt with free ISPs. We received many
requests to run those names again. With help from you, we added to
the list. Here you go: Juno (juno.com); freeinternet
(www.freeinternet.com/); NetZero (www.netzero.com/); BlueLight.com
(www.bluelight.com/); freewwweb (www.freewwweb.com); iFreedom
(www.ifreedom.com); and AltaVista
(www.zdnet.com/downloads/altavista/). Remember, you can find free
ISPs by doing a simple Web search for ``free Internet.''

Journal-Constitution. E-mail questions to techsavvy(at)ajc.com.

 &HT;    Shop for tech support, not gigabytes and megahertz
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When you purchased your last microwave oven, did you
spend much time checking out who made the microwave transmitter? Or
did you make note of the cooking wattage? Did you spend some time
reading ``Microwave Ovens Made Simple''?
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that _ unafraid and untutored by any adult education
classes in the operation of microwaves _ you went down to the store
and simply picked out a microwave that was in your price range and
that looked big enough for your purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you haven't noticed _ you're not alone if you haven't,
because I don't hear many people talking about this yet _ but
personal computers are finally reaching the microwave oven stage in
the market cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Now, unless you are buying a PC to play games or to perform some
really complex and specialized task, the truth is that it doesn't
much matter what kind of computer you buy. I spent a few minutes
looking through the ads in Sunday's newspaper, and even the bargain
basement machines are much more powerful than my home PC.
</P>
<P>
   I have an old 350-megahertz Pentium II machine. And the slowest
machines I found in the ads were running at 500 megahertz. But the
truth is that _ unlike things were even a year ago _ there is no
real urgency for me to upgrade my PC.
</P>
<P>
   If you've read this column for a long time you may remember
Husted's First Law of Computer Purchasing: Replace your computer
when it can no longer perform your tasks in a reasonably efficient
manner. Despite the fact that I'm practically a computer genius
(just ask my mom), the tasks at my house are pretty simple. I do
word processing, figure my taxes, mess with the Internet and use
the computer to edit and store electronic photographs. And even the
old 350-megahertz PC breezes through those jobs.
</P>
<P>
   That shouldn't be surprising. Home PCs are now much more
powerful than the big mainframe computers that businesses used 10
years ago, enormously faster than the computers that were aboard
the Apollo spacecraft that landed on the moon. And, despite the
fact that software programs seem to get fatter and more heavily
laden with mostly useless features each year, most of the programs
that I use still do not strain my dinosaur of a PC.
</P>
<P>
   Now here's what that means to you. If you are an ordinary home
user in the market for a PC, you no longer need to worry about
whether you can pop for the very fastest machine. And frankly you
needn't worry too much about whether the PC you buy has an AMD
Athelon chip or one made by Intel. Both chips are well-proven and
(as computer hardware goes) trouble-free.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays you need a new mind-set for PC buying. Instead of
agonizing over the specs (pondering the merits of a 15-gigabyte
hard disk compared to those of a 21-gigabyte disk, worrying whether
16 megabytes of VRAM is enough for a video card or whether you'd be
happier with 32 megabytes), shift your worries to ones that will be
familiar to most consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at the type of customer service and technical
support you can expect after the purchase. The rule of thumb is
that big brand-name manufacturers will do the best job. It's simply
a matter of God being on the side of the big battalions. Big
companies can afford to man a tech support line 24 hours a day,
seven days a week. Some of the smaller companies cannot. Be
especially wary of companies that offer support by e-mail and Web
site only.
</P>
<P>
   Find out what the repair policies are. Will you get on-site
repair service? Do you take the PC to a local store or repair
center? Is the PC shipped off to some distant repair center? Or
will you be shipped replacement parts and be expected to replace
them yourself? There are no wrong answers. A lot depends on what
feels comfortable to you. But find out in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Finally pay attention to the offer itself. Some machines are
bundled with useless software, free Internet service or accessories
that you already have in an effort to justify a higher price. Often
you'll do better just selecting the PC you want and then buying the
accessories you actually need.

 &HT;    A lukewarm slide show
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Essentially a portable lamp, the Super Show Projector and
Flashlight ($15; www.fisher-price.com) suffers the common foible of
low-grade illumination, ``hot'' and ``cold'' spots emanating from
the reflector causing the beam's periphery to be brighter than the
center. As a slide show projector, this causes inconsistent
brightness of any given frame, weakest in the middle. Yet the Super
Show's durable design and obviously easy-to-please kiddy target
market still makes it worthy of purchase, especially considering
that those exceptionally fun ViewMaster Viewer discus slides can
now be projected on the wall, floor or ceiling for everyone to
enjoy (but not in three dimensions, of course, like in the original
dual-lens solo viewers). It requires four ``C'' batteries, which
are not included. It also would have been nice to see an AC power
adapter port on the unit, but dangling a 120-volt power cord in
front of a 3-year-old is probably ill advised anyway. Rechargeable
batteries are recommended.
</P>
<P>
   CLICK AND SAY 'CHEESE!'
</P>
<P>
   Maisy's Playhouse ($20; www. soundsourceinteractive.com) brings
the charming kiddy cartoon and book icon to the digital realm in a
sparse but effective suite of interactive learning games. The
affable mouse and her interactive house, as in other incarnations,
are crudely drawn in that childlike way with delightfully mild
voice-overs coaxing kids through a series of basic
shape-recognition games with an intuitive point-and-click
interface. One of the more ingratiating aspects of Maisy's
Playhouse is found in the sound effects, which are all done with
voice rather than genuine sound samples, making the learning
experience seemingly personalized, virtual that it may be.

 &HT;    Word-WordPerfect debate turns serious
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This debate we've been having over Word, WordPerfect
and formatting codes has taught me something _ there's an alarming
shortage of humor amongst you.
</P>
<P>
   There has been the expected rush of e-mail over the column a few
weeks ago about whether WordPerfect's ``reveal codes'' function is
useful or merely unpatriotic. Not one of them, with the possible
exception of dear Marj Becker of Colorado, seemed to realize I was
putting you on.
</P>
<P>
   ``A code is not to keep secrets,'' one reader lectures. ``A code
is to precisely instruct the software to do what you, the operator,
wants. Word and the all-knowing Bill Gates have determined that
you, and I, don't really know what we want or don't care and so
most of the time Word makes the decision for us. Fortunately, or
unfortunately, those of you who think Reveal Codes is a bother,
don't know or don't care but some of the rest of us do.''
</P>
<P>
   Another gets downright insulting:
</P>
<P>
   ``There are, it seems, two types of writers _ those who write
simple memos, and those who are serious about writing. Word is
great for the memo writers _ you don't have to worry about
anything, just type and type and the words come out _ sort of like
`Word Processing for Dummies' ''
</P>
<P>
   She presents some elaborate formatting concepts that she says WP
does better than Word, and concludes from this that ``there are the
professional writers, who love WordPerfect, and then there are the
memo writers.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgive me, madam, but it sounds to me like you are talking
about professional formatters, not professional writers.
</P>
<P>
   The redoubtable Ms. Becker, whose praise of WordPerfect started
all this, doesn't mince words.
</P>
<P>
   ``You and your wife may be the only people on the face of the
earth who like MS Word _ no secretary-type in this office (there
are about fifteen) does. Of course, they are far too shy to bring
up the subject of its incredibly unfriendly (would that make it
user-unfriendly?) program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are my arms permanently attached to the keyboard? Some days I
think so. I do, however, detach them long enough to `smack around'
someone who attacks my WordPerfect. So, thanks for the
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Becker, who leaves no stone unthrown, proceeds to smack me
around a little more for an egregious grammatical error in that
column.
</P>
<P>
   A number of readers sent in their answer to J.B. McKoy's
complaint about Word not allowing him to select noncontiguous
batches of text. It does, Mr. McKoy, it does.
</P>
<P>
   I believe Jim Penland of Atlanta was in first with the solution,
which is described in Word's help file.
</P>
<P>
   ``To select a vertical-horizontal box in Word, just hold down
the Alt key and use the left mouse button to select the text,'' he
wrote. ``Simple, effective, and, I agree, practically useless!''

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   We've written a lot about Tony Hawk Pro Skater with good reason
_ it took the world by storm in 1999 as the best skateboard game
ever. Previously available on the Sony PlayStation and the Nintendo
64, the super thrasher has come to Sega with a Dreamcast version
($50; www. dreamcast.com; for the Dreamcast). It might very well be
the best all-around video game, ever. Extending an elemental law of
physics to include ``what goes up must pull off a Varial before it
comes down,'' Tony Hawk Pro Skater brings all the superlative
joyousness and raunchy implied pain of real life skating to video
game land with a large arsenal of tricks and stunts as well as
vivid skull smacks and magnificent blood spurts should one crash
and bail aggressively. Super console graphics and sound heighten
what was already -- cringingly painful looking game on the
PlayStation and a fluffy, bloodless extravaganza on the
family-friendly N64. This is by far the best version yet.
</P>
<P>
   While it's extremely rare to see an original video game concept
in an industry more famous for its peel, steal and market-like-hell
m.o., unique games have been known to pop up now and again. Sega's
Space Channel 5 ($40; www.sega.com; for the Dreamcast) is one such
game, but that's where the righteousness ends. ``Space'' is a
bizarre, damn-near-creepy disco dancing game featuring scantily
clad nymphs and groovy dudes hypnotizing and defeating foes by
mimicking perky, alluring dance steps to the beat of retro-techno
funk. It's got all the charm of the lingerie section of your mom's
Sears catalogue and a Dr. Rhythm drum machine. Rife with clunky
gameplay reminiscent of the electronic toy version of ``Simon,''
this title targets a ``broader'' demographic; actual video game
buffs need not bother. Kudos for trying, though. The next Sears
Catalogue is due out this fall.
</P>
<P>
   If you've played Gauntlet Legends at the arcade, you know how
addictive the game can be. With multiple players going on a hack
and slash quest (here's a wizard, an archer and a barbarian,
slicing through orcs and looking for treasure chests), it was
quarter-plunking video game nirvana. After a blurry two-player-only
PlayStation version and a blotchy-looking translation for Nintendo
64, it took the hardware muscle of the Sega Dreamcast to unleash
the definitive home version. Gauntlet Legends for Dreamcast ($40;
www.midway.com; for the Dreamcast) is pixel-perfect, gorgeous,
fast, and fun. The game is as sharp as the arcade, with four-player
mode, 41 levels and characters taken from the new ``Gauntlet Dark
Legacy'' arcade game. It's one of the most fun cooperative games
out. You can also get free pewter figures in the mail from Midway
after buying the game. So the only question is, if you don't
already have a Dreamcast to enjoy the raft of great games available
for the system (I loved Space Channel 5, by the way), what's
stopping you? The Playstation 2? Happy waiting.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   When you join the thick of battle in Shogun: Total War ($40;
www.totalwar.com; for Windows), it's hard to keep phrases like
''instant classic'' and ''sets a new standard'' from the back of
your mind. This simulation of 15th-century feudal Japanese warfare
has captured the Grail of PC gaming with its immersive 3-D
horizon-to-horizon battles, lovingly detailed from the glint of
sunlight on distant spears to the horror of watching your
1,000-samurai army break and run. Amid these riches, any complaints
_ the skimpy mapless manual comes to mind _ are mere quibbles. For
thinkers who savor strategy, an engaging but optional turn-based,
''Risk''-style campaign game with cinematics provides
empire-building intrigue and context. But the real rush is on the
battlefield. Blizzards howl, lightning strikes and the crackle of
muskets produces a line of drifting smoke amid the gabble and
clatter of pitched fighting. An eight-multiplayer option rounds out
this little masterpiece. Shogun: Total War is a detailed, endlessly
replayable, smooth-running depiction of the earnest struggle for
control of an empire. We've been waiting for this great game all
along and just didn't know it.

   Remember ``Walkie Talkies,'' those flimsy kids' toys that banged
around the backyard or weighed down the belts of park rangers and
security guards? Well they're back, slimmed down and tricked out
for the go-anywhere, do-anything age. Motorola's palm-sized,
lightweight TalkAbout Two-Way Radio ($160; www.motorola.com) with a
NiMH rechargeable battery, offers a solid two-mile communication
range that works in or outdoors. The radio is ideal for trade show
teams scouring the show floors, family members on camping trips,
even for the college convoy on that road trip to the annual kegger
off the beaten path. Utilizing the 14 channels of FRS (Family Radio
Service) _ as opposed to the inconsistent CB (Citizen's Band) _
these units offer high-powered, short-range communication of
professional caliber. With 38 subchannels per channel on which to
stake a claim, the airwaves promise to be traffic-free somewhere
within the allotted range. Best of all, the TalkAbout is inherently
compatible with any FRS radio, meaning it's easy to augment
Motorola's high-end units with less expensive models from any
brand.

   A combination of elastic strapping, Velcro, a zipper, a clip and
wee bit of nylon makes Case Logic's CD Player TranSport ($10;
www.casedirect.com) the epitome of less-is-more functionality. This
innovative portable CD companion piece allows one's diminutive disc
spinner to assertively attach to a bicycle, backpack, belt,
treadmill or what have you while still allowing easy access to the
player's buttons. There's even an accessory pocket for spare
batteries, locker key, photos and the like.

 &HT;    Few common chords struck in hearing over music downloads
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A songwriting senator summoned rock stars and
dot.com entrepreneurs to testify Tuesday about whether there is an
``upside of downloading'' music on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican and singer-composer of
gospel and pop songs, called a hearing of the Senate Judiciary
Committee ``to learn more about the online music marketplace and
why there is so much disharmony.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee got an earful of the continuing cacophony over
online copyright protection.
</P>
<P>
   Lars Ulrich, drummer and co-founder of the band Metallica, said
his introduction to the problem came when the firm Napster
``hijacked our music without asking'' and enabled its subscribers
to duplicate the songs for free over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Hank Barry, the CEO of Napster, disagreed. He
said Napster's technology merely permits its 20 million members to
individually share their collections of digitalized music and that
such ``sampling'' actually promotes CD sales. On many campuses,
Napster is so popular that high-speed college computer systems are
sometimes clogged with students swapping music files called MP3's.
</P>
<P>
   Roger McGuinn, a songwriter and founder of folk-rock's Byrds
band, said he has gotten a better deal distributing his music over
his own Internet site and the online firm MP3.com than he ever did
when major labels controlled his hits like ``The Ballad of Easy
Rider.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fred Erlich, Sony Music's president of new technology, said
artists as well as record labels will suffer if the ``value chain''
is broken through free online distribution of their works and there
is no financial incentive to create and produce music.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses did strike a few common chords: The Internet has
already changed the way recorded music reaches consumers. Even in a
digital economy, there is intellectual property and artists should
be compensated for its creation. The issues go far beyond Napster,
a pioneering company that has generated far more controversy than
revenues. And justice has to keep up with technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must protect the rights of the creator,'' said Hatch. ``But
we cannot, in the name of copyright, unduly burden consumers and
the promising technology that the Internet presents to us all.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said the hearing was aimed at providing information rather
than writing legislation. Action on the issue will come sooner in
the courts than in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Metallica and the major record labels have filed lawsuits
charging Napster with copyright infringements. The record companies
also sued MP3.com over its plan to immediately put a digitalized
version of a CD on a customer's computer ``locker'' when they
bought the actual CD. The problem, according to the music industry,
was that MP3.com created a library of 45,000 copyrighted CDs to be
digitally send into the ``lockers'' rather than copying the actual
purchased CD.
</P>
<P>
   But Gene Kan, developer of Gnutella, another online music
distribution system, said the music industry had better recognize
that ``the toothpaste is already out of the tube'' and adjust.
While Napster is built upon a directory of members who exchange
music with each other, Gnutella's ``community'' is connected only
by a common software that they downloaded for free. The software
lets them exchange MP3 music files without passing through any sort
of central switchboard.
</P>
<P>
   Napster and Gnutella ``are like potlucks,'' Kan explained.
``Everyone brings what he or she wants to share and perhaps
partakes in what others brought.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like movie makers had to adjust to an era of easily copied
videotapes, record companies and artists themselves are going to
have to find a way to make a profit distributing music online, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But some other online music distribution systems are also upset
with Napster and Gnutella. Gene Hoffman, president of EMusic.com,
said his firm has licensing agreements with many artists and
independent record labels that allow him to sell downloaded CD
tracks for 99 cents apiece. But even at that price, he said, its
hard to compete with free tracks.

&HT;     MINORITY PARTY MISCHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The minority party candidates are making merry
mischief this presidential campaign. They are not to be taken
seriously on the merits but are nonetheless potentially troublesome
for Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Buchanan's raw power grab for the Reform Party's federal
funds and Ralph Nader's hypocritical opportunism as the Green Party
nominee are disgusting.
</P>
<P>
   Yet both could be selfish spoilers, distorting the outcome of a
close race. And the contest between Bush and Gore does look like a
squeaker.
</P>
<P>
   There is also Harry Browne, nominee of the Libertarian Party,
but he is unlikely to be much of a factor. The Libertarian platform
is a prescription for anarchy _ repeal of Social Security, ending
the war on drugs, wiping out the income tax and funding the
military through sales taxes and tariffs. This is fantasy stuff,
not political reality.
</P>
<P>
   And something called the Southern Party is trying to get off the
ground in South Carolina, where white resentment over the
downgrading of the Confederate flag has sparked a pro-secession
move. Dream on, fellows. Remember what happened in 1865 to the last
war over the union.
</P>
<P>
   Well, no one said democracy would be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Periodically scholars, journalists and idealists trumpet the
idea that the time has finally arrived for a real third party to
rival the two major ones. It didn't happen even when Theodore
Roosevelt tried it. So why should it happen now?
</P>
<P>
   Running as an independent in 1992, Ross Perot did the best in
modern times, getting 19 percent of the vote. But he spent $65
million of his own money doing it.
</P>
<P>
   His personality was so quirky and his grasp of facts so thin
that after he ran again as the founder of the Reform Party in 1996,
he was down to only 8 percent of the vote. But it was enough to
qualify his party for $12.6 million in federal funds for this
year's election, and that's the big lure for former Republican
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Newsweek poll finds Bush and Gore in a dead heat, with
Nader at 6 percent and Buchanan at 2 percent. Nader, pulling from
the left, would take voters almost entirely from Gore. Buchanan's
handful was stolen mostly from Bush.
</P>
<P>
   (Buchanan is still fighting for the Reform nomination with
Natural Law Party leader John Hagelin, whose platform is Anybody
but Buchanan. The party's convention will be in August in Long
Beach, Calif.)
</P>
<P>
   The also-ran numbers are not yet enough to scare the two real
candidates in the presidential race. But what if Nader and Buchanan
or Hagelin pick up a lot more supporters in the fall once the
general election is really under way? Many voters don't seem
energized by either Bush or Gore, which means they are vulnerable
to being swayed and sidetracked.
</P>
<P>
   What if the minor candidates manage to bull their way into the
presidential debates, currently closed to hopefuls who do not have
at least a 15 percent approval rating in the polls? They are
already trying through legal ploys and public appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The media exposure, in a forum that bills Nader and
Buchanan/Hagelin as co-equals with Bush and Gore, could
significantly muddy the issues. It would keep the messages of the
two principals from coming through. And let's face it, we need to
hear them because one of the two, not these other guys, is going to
be president.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, independent and third party candidates matter very
little in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Even Alabama Gov. George Wallace, taken seriously in 1968,
garnered only 13.5 percent running on a new American Independent
party, pulling from both Democrats and Republicans. He may have
marginally helped Richard Nixon defeat Hubert Humphrey by half a
percentage point, but opinions vary on this.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976 former Sen. Eugene McCarthy won less than 1 percent of
the vote. His time, along with the flower children who loved him in
1968, had passed. He ran on a sour-grapes ticket, and that is not
the American way.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980 former Rep. John Anderson got 6.6 percent as an
independent. Liberals saw him as a rational alternative to the
disappointing President Jimmy Carter until it dawned on them they
would be throwing away their vote to elect Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Third parties and independents may seem appealing until they are
really examined for who they are and what they stand for.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, the famous consumer advocate, now has more than $3
million in corporate stock investments. Yet his basic campaign
theme is that corporate America stinks and that Bush and Gore
aren't doing enough to control Wall Street. So why does he support
these evil companies with his own money?
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, trying to take over a party founded on principles that
bear little relationship to his own, deserted the Republicans
because he was not going to win their nomination. So he says he
won't change the Reform platform. He'll just espouse his own
isolationist, cultural-backlash themes while spending the party's
money.
</P>
<P>
   This is nuts. The two-party system works fine, if not perfectly.
Why can't we leave it at that?

  Stage production of `Harold and Maude' becomes a family affair 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Talk about an offbeat family legacy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, actress Ellen Geer made her film debut in an oddball
little number called ``Harold and Maude.'' You might remember it:
Suicide-obsessed kid falls for an 80-year-old free spirit?
</P>
<P>
   Geer had a single scene in the film, but it was a scene-stealer.
She played Sunshine Dore, the would-be actress who ends up being
young Harold Chasen's ``last date'' arranged by his mother through
a computer matchmaking service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was the best thing I read in quite a while,''
recalled Geer, of the now-famous script written by the late Colin
Higgins. ``You know, it's very rare to have a good experience in
film and to work with (director) Hal Ashby was extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward nearly 30 years to the Theatricum Botanicum in
Topanga, where Geer serves as artistic director. In Higgins' stage
adaptation of ``Harold and Maude,'' which runs weekends through
Sept. 30, Geer will now get to tackle the role of Maude (played in
the film by Ruth Gordon). But director Heidi Helen Davis has kept
Sunshine in the family, so to speak. Ellen Geer's daughter, Willow
Geer-Alsop, will share the role with Abby Craden (OK, Craden's not
a Geer, but she's still practically family since since she's
engaged to marry Ellen's son, Ian Flanders.)
</P>
<P>
   A quirk of casting, perhaps, but for Davis, rebuilding ``Harold
and Maude'' wasn't just a matter of switching Geers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would adamantly say that I cast the people who I thought
were the best,'' said Davis, who has worked with both Craden and
Geer-Alsop in past productions. ``Every time we left the auditions,
Ellen would say, `You have to pick the right ones. Don't let family
be the deciding factor. You don't have to please me.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``They both gave wonderful readings,'' says the ever-diplomatic
Geer. `I'm glad I wasn't the director. I wouldn't have been able to
choose.''
</P>
<P>
   Once it was established the role would be double cast, neither
Sunshine said she planned to copy her predecessor. Both had seen
the film; both elected not to study it again or ask Geer for tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all rented `Harold and Maude' at Halloween or
something,'' says Craden. ``When I watched it, I didn't know I was
going to be playing the role, so it wasn't from an acting point of
view. I just watched it to look at Ellen and see how beautiful she
was when she was young. It was amazing to see her do her work.''
</P>
<P>
   Geer-Alsop, who even in junior high school was aware that her
mom was part of a cult film, didn't feel extra pressure in taking
on her mother's role. ``When I saw the movie, I'm thinking, `OK,
how am I going to do this? How am I going to make it my own?''' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, of course, at the audition, all these old actors and
friends kept walking in right before I'm about to start, so I have,
like, this huge audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Two actresses mean two interpretations. Theatricum audiences
aren't likely to confuse red-haired Geer-Alsop, a sophomore at
UCLA, and brunet Craden, an award-winning actress with professional
credits at theaters from Los Angeles to Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so different. It's marvelous,'' says Craden. ``We watch
each other, and we're completely different.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if anybody in this production is drawing inspiration
from a family member, it's Ellen Geer herself. Geer acquired the
rights to ``Harold and Maude'' in the hopes that her 83-year-old
mother, Herta Ware, would play Maude. The timing didn't work out,
so Geer inherited the Maude mantle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put a lot of her into it, because she is Maude,'' says Geer.
``She's the most Maude Maude I've ever met.'' &QL;

 (Attn: N.J.)   (Eds: 2nd take contains 700 words of recipes for pea pancakes, pea
and chanterelle ragout and pea soup)  
 By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Until this summer, Wayne Nish, the chef at March in
Manhattan, relied on frozen peas for his ambitious menu. Since the
packers would freeze the peas while they were still in the fields,
before their sugar turned to starch, he said ``frozen peas were
generally better than anything fresh that a purveyor sent.''
</P>
<P>
   But now Nish has switched to a type of fresh peas that are so
old they're new again. He is buying an heirloom variety called
Lincoln, peas that are both sweet and tender, ideal for pureeing
into a smooth soup garnished with frogs' legs.
</P>
<P>
   Heirloom tomatoes, apples, beans and potatoes have become almost
commonplace in farmers' markets, but this is the first year in
which peas have become consistently available in varieties that
were grown decades ago, before cross-breeding for long shelf life
and truck travel led to vegetables that were more sturdy than sweet
and flavorful.
</P>
<P>
   These are peas with old-fashioned names as distinctive as their
irregular pods. Besides the fat Lincolns favored by Nish, there are
long, slim Waverex Petits Pois, rounded, fat Aldermans, bulging
Dwarf Gray Sugars and Mammoth Melting Sugars in paper-thin pods.
</P>
<P>
   All are carried by David Size, the owner of Heirloom Harvest
Farms in Blairstown, N.J., who has a stand in the Union Square
Greenmarket on Wednesdays, on the northern edge of the park.
</P>
<P>
   Everything he grows, from artichokes to watermelons, is an
heirloom _ varieties dating back at least sixty years. But from
June through July, his stand is dominated by peas.
</P>
<P>
   He grows 10 varieties, each distinct in shape and nuance of
flavor but all far sweeter than most of the fresh peas available in
supermarkets and vegetable stands. They sell for $4 a pound, about
the price of regular sugar snap peas at the greenmarket.
</P>
<P>
   Markets like the Gourmet Garage chain in Manhattan are also
selling heirloom peas this year: Alderman, Mammoth Melting Sugar,
and the original Burpee Sugar Snaps. They come from Size and other
farmers, including one in Bloomington, N.Y., and are all $3.95 a
pound.
</P>
<P>
   Paulette Satur, owner of the organic Satur Farms in Cutchogue,
on Long Island, grows heirloom dwarf sugar snap peas called Sugar
Ann to supply restaurants (although the season has ended).
</P>
<P>
   She said the decline of commercial peas began when scientists
first started creating hybrids on a large scale after World War II,
crossing a very sweet pea with one that shipped well, for instance,
or with one that grew in a bush rather than on a vine. Those
hybrids, she said, were ``selected for certain characteristics that
aren't necessarily good for the flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   Sara Jenkins of I Coppi uses the heirloom peas in a soup with
crisp prosciutto because ``they taste like they're just picked from
the garden _ like they're supposed to.'' Patricia Williams, the
chef of Butterfield 81 on the Upper East Side, is using heirloom
peas in a ragout with chorizo, fava beans, heirloom tomatoes and
leeks that is served under roasted red snapper. ``The heirlooms
have a real sweetness to them,'' she said. ``Some people will even
cook the regular peas with a little bit of sugar, but I don't find
you need to do that with the heirloom peas. They have their own
sugar.''
</P>
<P>
   Heirloom peas have to be refrigerated and should be used within
two days of when they are bought.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Telepan of Judson Grill has also been won over by heirloom
peas, combining petits pois and sugar snaps in his pea pancakes,
which are served as part of an ever-changing vegetable plate. He is
such a fan he is adopting a page out of Wayne Nish's old playbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``The season is so short that while we have all the peas I just
shell them, throw them in bags and freeze them,'' he said. ``They
hold up for three or four months, though we usually go through them
before that.''

<P>
   ATLANTA - Soon after hearing a loud pop on a non-contact play
against Dallas in the Monday-night game Sept. 20, Jamal Anderson
became invisible.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right
knee, could barely stand, let alone stand to watch, as the Falcons
plummeted from Super Bowl XXXIII to 5-11.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt very responsible,'' he said. ``Trying to stand on the
sidelines, it was like being a ghost. After a while, I couldn't (do
it). You're there, but not there. I couldn't do anything, was
helpless. I kept thinking, `What if they forget me, forget I'm
there?' ``
</P>
<P>
   Anderson isn't forgotten. The state of his recuperation will be
the biggest story when the Falcons report to training camp Thursday
at Furman University in Greenville, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Anderson was master of his domain. But for the
past 10 months, he has been mastered by the injury and his knee.
The memory has faded of his All-Pro 1998 season, when he rushed an
NFL-record 410 times for a franchise-record 1,846 yards. By April,
Anderson was on track to participate in voluntary passing camp in
June. Then, in May, the right patella tendon from which tissue was
grafted to repair his knee became inflamed. The pain from the
tendinitis limited him to two of 16 practices. ``Jamal learned he
needs to be honest with us about how his knee feels,'' trainer Ron
Medlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson resumed cutting exercises Monday, and expects to be
ready for Friday's first practice.
</P>
<P>
   However, his official status is uncertain. He tries to sound
confident about his comeback. ``Of critical importance to me is to
be able to start this camp, and quickly get to where I can just
go,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But a few minutes later, he will say, ``I haven't set a panic
date, but I would panic in late August if this thing were still
bugging me.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who has Hollywood aspirations after his football
career, is the only Falcon consistently referred to by first name
only.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see so many people, after a game, they're, like, `Oh, yeah,
we played well. We got after `em,' `` he said, using a monotone
voice. ``That's just not me. I'm outgoing but laid back, if that
makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jamal insists that he's an ordinary Joe. Perhaps it's only
an act when he teases reporters, does the ``Dirty Bird'' dance in
the end zone and struts like a peacock. His house in Duluth is not
the home of an ordinary Joe. Bought after he signed a five-year,
$32 million contract in August, it is big but decorated nicely in
an understated way that belies Jamal's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the basement. There, he has a bar, a theater, game
balls from the Falcons, magazine covers, large oil paintings of
Michael Jordan and Barry Sanders, shorts that Muhammad Ali boxed in
and memorabilia signed by buddies Mike Tyson, Marcus Allen, Karl
Malone and Eddie George.
</P>
<P>
   But out back, he has a grill, where he cooks hot dogs and
burgers. He has Michelob in the fridge. His office has stacks of
stuff, and boxes of more. In the living room, there's a basket of
toys. On the kitchen counter, crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   In those surroundings, it's much easier to imagine Jamal as an
ordinary Joe.
</P>
<P>
   On the job, Anderson is the player that reporters go to for
color.But much of it's show. When the tape recorders are off,
Anderson solicits opinions, seeks advice, occasionally asks that a
secret be kept.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm walking through a mall or something, I come up to
people and mess with them just to disarm them, let them know I'm no
different,'' he said. Anderson has become a family man. His
daughters, 2 1/2 and 1, live with him in Atlanta, not in Salt Lake
City, where he previously spent offseasons.The names of family
members remain private.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a lot bigger part of my life,'' he said. ``When you
get to a certain point, you're a lot more guarded - more protective
of certain things.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammates and coach Dan Reeves are hoping Anderson returns to
form soon. Last season, the Falcons were next to last in the NFL in
rushing. When Anderson ran for more than 100 yards in 12 of 16
regular-season games in 1998, Atlanta led the league in time of
possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing was he kept (the defense) off the field,''
Tuggle said. ``And you knew when Jamal hit the field, he came to
punish people. That motivated you.''
</P>
<P>
   The threat of Anderson cleared the way for the passing game,
which led the NFL in yards per passing attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``You also missed his leadership during games, during
practice,'' Reeves said. ``Any time you have a guy who has the
confidence Jamal has, it's contagious.''
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Terance Mathis agrees. ``Jamal has a `Me'
attitude, and it's a good thing,'' Mathis said. ``He gives us a
little flash, a little brawn and excitement. That carried us in
`98.''
</P>
<P>
   After learning that Anderson's 1999 season was over, teammates
and coaches said the right things, the usual things about picking
up the slack. In reality, with quarterback Chris Chandler already
nursing a lame hamstring, the Falcons' season was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``When his knee went out in that Dallas game, I think the team
as a whole lost a lot of confidence,'' Tuggle said. Revenge is
another motivator in Anderson's rehabilitation. It burns Anderson
that some fans associate his injury with his contract holdout last
summer. Some of the fan mail he has received hurt worse than having
scar tissue broken up in his knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's heard whispers of `one-year wonder,' `` King said. ``It
pains him.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than the sore knee, Anderson is in pretty good shape. But
these numbers pain him: 1999 19 carries, 59 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I waited all my career to play on Monday Night Football,'' he
said, ``and then to blow out my knee on a play like that it was,
like, `This is unreal.' `` The ghost is tired of being invisible.
He expects to be back, even if he has to take every other practice
off for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always put pressure on myself, but especially now,'' he
said. ``Somebody told me, and I agree, that you know you're there
when, whether they love you or hate you, they damn sure want to see
you and talk about you.''

KIRBY 64 IS THE BEST KIRBY GAME YET

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   For years now, Kirby has been kind of a video-game underdog.
While your kids beg for Tomb Raider and Lara Croft, James Bond and
GoldenEye 007 and Pikachu and Pokemon (come to think of it, do
people still care about Pokemon?), Kirby just sort of sits there, a
hero to those who've bought Kirby-related games, a who's-that? to
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes the little pink Pac-Man-like critter's games all the
more inviting; it's like your own special little club that know one
else knows _ or, ahem, cares _ about.
</P>
<P>
   Kirby's latest title, Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards (Nintendo for
N64), is easily the best Kirby game yet, if only because it
combines elements of previous Kirby titles with looking-forward
twists and turns.
</P>
<P>
   The game's story line finds Kirby teaming up with old pals
Waddle Dee and King Dedede for a trip around six planets. You guys
are hunting for Crystal Shards.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of Mario 64 will notice plenty of similarities, starting
with the hunt-for-those-crystal-thingees. Another familiar sight
will be the colorful, three-dimensional graphics. As in Mario, you
direct Kirby through 360-degree environments, meaning you can move
him in any direction possible.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, as is the case with Mario, there are several mini-games
hidden throughout, including an especially fun four-player
showdown.
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds like a complete Mario rip, well, to some extent
it is. But there are enough elements of past Kirby games _ all the
characters, some of the same game-playing styles _ to give this a
fresh, yet familiar, vibe. Dig in, Kirby fans, all 12 of ya.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney Pictures Presents Dinosaur (UbiSoft for Game Boy
Color): If you've seen the movie _ uh, anyone? _ you already know
the basis for this game: Lead the dinosaurs to the safety of their
nesting grounds, apparently so they can later star in Jurassic
Park.
</P>
<P>
   For a Game Boy title, this isn't bad. The graphics are
relatively decipherable, and the game has quite a bit of replay
value, in a Tetris sort of way. Too bad the movie didn't have this
much bite.
</P>
<P>
   Starcraft 64 (Blizzard Entertainment for N64): Continuing the
trend of porting over each and every Super Nintendo title to the
N64, Blizzard's update of Starcraft simply doesn't have the
firepower of other N64 games. Longtime fans of the futuristic war
game will love the strategic elements here _ building armies,
making war plans, blah de blah. But casual gamers will yawn at the
graphics and the somewhat slow gameplay. This is strictly for the
hard-core fan.

have their horns removed at birth. These cows, which have both
udders and horns, are Swiss milking cows.
</P>
<P>
   NO. 2: Herd mentality. Zurich had the first cow parade, Cows on
Parade, in 1998 (800 cows). Chicago got the second one, in 1999,
after a shoe salesman from Chicago saw the Zurich cow parade and
decided his city had to have a bovine event, too. (Chicago had 340
cows.) In 1999 CowParade Holdings, the for-profit corporation that
owns licensing rights to CowParade and Cows on Parade, asked the
New York City Parks Commissioner, Henry J. Stern, and Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani if New York wanted one. Sure, they said. So now New York
is copying Chicago, a cow town, and Switzerland, a cow country.
</P>
<P>
   NO. 3: Cowmerce. Each cow has been commissioned by a sponsor: a
corporation, community organization, individual or business,
including Hooters, Yahoo, The New York Times and a couple of
steakhouses. For $7,500 the sponsor chooses an artist to paint its
cow or selects a design that was submitted during an open call for
artists earlier this year. After publicizing the event through arts
organizations and news releases, CowParade received some 1,200
designs.
</P>
<P>
   NO. 4: Bad cow disease. During the open call, three cows were
rejected _ the Moonica Lewinsky cow, the Hasidic cow and a cow
covered with butcher's marks and unbecoming remarks about butchery
designed by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
</P>
<P>
   NO. 5: Moonotonous. Every cow is made of 100 pounds of
fiberglass that has been molded into one of three poses: standing
(head up), grazing (head down) and supine. All cows were made by
Silvestri Inc. in Los Angeles, or by the Resource Factory in
Sarasota, Fla., both manufacturers of fiberglass figures. The only
acts left to the artists who are picked by the sponsors are
painting, decorating and naming their cows. A cow floating on its
back in an inner tube near the McGraw-Hill building looked like the
work of an udder renegade.
</P>
<P>
   NO. 6: Cowmeras. Too many tourists taking too many pictures.
</P>
<P>
   NO. 7: Puns for names. Tutancowmon, Cowapatra, Cowlerina,
Cowleidoscope, Cowmooter, Taxi Cow (used five times), Picowsso
(three times), Moondrian (twice), Mootisse (once), MooMa (four
times), Moo York (a dozen times), Moomaid, Moo Indigo, MooShoe and
Herd on the Street (three times). Toss in the requisite Holy Cows
(used twice) and Sacred Cows (seven times), and you get the
picture. These cows are a public moosance.

<TEXT>
<P>
   As I worked my way through the 734 pages of ``Harry Potter and
the Goblet of Fire'' on Friday, every time I came across an
unfamiliar term I'd jot it down.
</P>
<P>
   Muggles, floo powder, Quidditch, Hogwarts, Mudbloods, sorting
hat, Snitch ...
</P>
<P>
   Before reaching page 100 I had scribbler's cramp and I gave up.
</P>
<P>
   One of the myriad charms of the Potter series is the expanding
glossary of terms invented by J.K. Rowling _ everything from the
wonderfully Dickensian character names (Albus Dumbledore, Cedric
Diggory, Professor Moody) to the wizard-and-witches lingo, e.g.,
memory charms and portkeys and dementors.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Rowling finishes the seven-book series, some of
these words will no doubt be in the Webster's dictionary, just like
such recent additions as ``dot-com,'' ``24-7,'' ``phat'' and ``eye
candy.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least with Potterisms we can give credit where credit is
due. The origins of many slang terms are nearly impossible to
discern; they just ooze into the popular dialogue until they're so
ubiquitous they reach Betty White.
</P>
<P>
   Right now there are dozens of exceedingly clever terms
circulating on the Web, usually under the heading ``Early 00's
Vocabulary.'' Every week someone forwards some version of the list
to me _ but I've never been able to find the author(s). Something
tells me these phrases are like urban legends and disaster jokes _
invented by a secret committee of magical, anonymous, big-brained
idea junkies, working out of a big room somewhere beneath the
streets of the city.
</P>
<P>
   If there's someone out there who can prove they invented any or
all of these terms I'd love to give you the proper kudos. Until
then, I hereby present some of my favorite entrants from the
Internet Glossary of Terms, 2000 Edition, authored by Anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   ADMINISPHERE: The rarefied organizational layers of upper
management, e.g., ``We have to do it, the orders came from the
adminisphere.''
</P>
<P>
   ALPHA GEEK: The person in your group who knows the most about
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ASSMOSIS: Process by which some seemingly incompetent people in
the office seem to absorb salary increases and promotions by
kissing up to the big boss.
</P>
<P>
   BATTLE FAXES: Flurry of hostile faxes sent between warring
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   BEEPILEPSY: That quick body jolt you see when someone's beeper
goes off.
</P>
<P>
   BLAMESTORMING: Getting together with a group of coworkers to
talk about why a deadline was missed or a proposal was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   BODY NAZIS: Workout nuts who drive everybody else crazy with
their constant talk about exercise and their incessant nagging of
those who don't work out.
</P>
<P>
   CLM (CAREER LIMITING MOVE): Dissing your boss while she's within
earshot or mistakenly sending a nasty interoffice message to the
wrong person is a CLM.
</P>
<P>
   CHIPS AND SALSA: Another computer term, signifying hardware
(chips) and software (salsa).
</P>
<P>
   EGO SURFING: Typing in your own name on Internet search engines.
</P>
<P>
   404: Someone who's a dim bulb. The term comes from the Internet
error message, ``404 Not Found,'' meaning that the requested
document is unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   FLIGHT RISK: Employee who seems destined to leave the company
soon.
</P>
<P>
   GENERICA: Lookalike stretches of fast-food joints, strip malls,
etc., found all over suburbia, as in, ``We drove through 600 miles
of Generica, man.''
</P>
<P>
   IDEA HAMSTERS: Energetic workers who always come up with fresh
concepts.
</P>
<P>
   IRRITAINTMENT: News events that become cable-channel staples,
e.g., Elian Gonzalez, the O.J. Simpson trial, Monica Lewinsky,
Princess Di's crash.
</P>
<P>
   MOUSE POTATO: The cyber-generation's answer to the Couch Potato.
Someone who sits at the home computer for hours at a time.
</P>
<P>
   PERCUSSIVE MAINTENANCE: Attacking a technical problem by
whacking the offending machine several times.
</P>
<P>
   SEAGULL MANAGER: Midlevel executive who has a propensity for
showing up at your desk, making a lot of noise, crapping over
everything and then flying off.
</P>
<P>
   SITCOMS: (Single Income, Two Children, Oppressive Marriage.)
What yuppie families turn into when one spouse stops working to
care for the kids.
</P>
<P>
   STARTER MARRIAGE: A brief first marriage of twentysomethings
that produces no children, no property purchase, no lasting
commitment and no hard feelings.
</P>
<P>
   SWIPED OUT: What happens when an ATM card's magnetic strip has
been worn out due to constant use.
</P>
<P>
   UNINSTALLED: Fired from the job, e.g., ``They uninstalled
Freddie today!'.
</P>
<P>
   And my favorite of all has to be ...
</P>
<P>
   UMFRIEND, a term used when introducing a secret or new lover, as
in: ``This is Winona, my ... um, friend.''
</P>

KOREAN BANK WORKERS AGREE TO END STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL LEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ The South Korean government and labor
leaders agreed on Tuesday to end a strike by bank workers who
walked off their jobs earlier in the day to protest mergers that
could lead to thousands of layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 20,000 of the country's 65,000 unionized bank
workers went on strike on Tuesday, as reports circulated about
last-minute talks between the union and government.
</P>
<P>
   The union, the Korean Federation of Bank and Financial Labor
Unions, had called the strike to protest legislation that would
authorize the creation of financial holding companies, which
regulators have suggested may be the first step in merging troubled
banks. Bank workers, like workers in other Korean industries that
have undergone major restructuring in the last two years, fear that
consolidation would lead to sweeping layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders hailed the agreement reached on Tuesday. ``A major
achievement was in making sure government-influenced bank decisions
will no longer be allowed,'' said Lee Yong-deuk, chief of the
banking union.
</P>
<P>
   But South Korea's top financial regulator said that while the
government promised not to order banks to merge, it still intended
to proceed with its restructuring efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect increased momentum in implementing the next round of
financial restructuring,'' said Lee Yong-keun, the chairman of the
Financial Supervisory Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the agreement between the union and the government
will be announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors saw the announcement as a sign that the
government would not be diverted from an overhaul of financial
services. Bank stocks surged on Tuesday, even as the benchmark
stock index fell 1.72 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bank restructuring was a part of the reform package the South
Korean government accepted in return for a $58-billion bailout from
the International Monetary Fund in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, there were 33 South Korean banks, including
state-invested banks. By the end of last year, there were 23. From
December 1997 to 1998, the number of bank workers fell to 75,332
from 113,493.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Dae-shik, a professor of economics at Chung Ang University
here, noted that the government's resolve in cleaning up troubled
investment trusts weakened last year, compared with its closure of
banks in 1998. ``During the last two and a half years, there was no
set gauge that governed bank restructuring,'' he said. ``I believe
the government will use the next round of restructuring as a
milestone for its restructuring drive.''

TALIBAN RETARDS U.N. EFFORTS TO AID WORKING WOMEN IN AFGHANISTAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Years of United Nations efforts to help women
in Afghanistan return to work outside their homes have been set
back in recent days by the radical Islamic Taliban movement that
controls most of the country, officials said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a new edict circulated in Kabul, the capital, saying
that Afghan women would no longer be allowed to work with the
United Nations or private relief organizations, the only work
available to many women who must support families in a country
devastated by decades of civil war. The edict was issued by the
Ministry of Planning, which followed up its announcement with
letters to all aid agencies in the country.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Taliban's religious police arrested an American,
Mary MacMakin, 71, who had been working with Afghan widows through
an organization she founded, the Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation
Support for Afghanistan. Seven Afghan women working for her also
were arrested and MacMakin, who has lived in Afghanistan off and on
for more than 30 years, refused a Taliban offer to go free and
leave her colleagues in their custody.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, who had taken control of most of the country by
1996, have generally opposed women working outside the home. Over
the least year, however, women had begun to return to jobs in
health, education and food services.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials in the region said that the edict and subsequent
arrests have frightened many Afghan women, who are staying away
from work they need rather than risk arrest at the hands of
religious police who also monitor how the women dress, demanding
that they be covered from head to toe.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the United States, which has no diplomatic relations
with the Taliban, called for MacMakin's immediate release in a
statement from the American embassy in Islamabad, the capital of
neighboring Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   MacMakin had in the past been critical of the American boycott
of the Taliban. During a recent visit to the United States to raise
money for her struggling charity, she said that the isolation
imposed on Afghanistan by the Clinton Administration, alone and
through Security Council sanctions, was hurting the poorest Afghans
most.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban have never been permitted to take Afghanistan's U.N.
seat, which is still held by an opposition alliance operating from
outside the country. Still, U.N. officials are able to work in the
country, a very poor nation now suffering a severe drought.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the U.N. coordinator for Afghanistan, Erick de
Mul, is expected to go to Kandahar, the Taliban's spiritual
capital, to talk with Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil about
the new edicts. De Mul has spent many months negotiating with the
Taliban for small advances in women's rights, and U.N. agencies, in
particular the World Food Program, have made the hiring of women
mandatory if the Taliban want to continue receiving aid.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on Tuesday, the United Nations said that without
the participation of women, many programs in Afghanistan will be
severely affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Countrywide, hundreds of women would be affected by this new
edict,'' said Marie Okabe, a spokeswoman for Secretary-General Kofi
Annan.

FRANCE OFFERS HIGH LEVEL OF AUTONOMY TO CORSICA 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ After months of negotiations with Corsican nationalists,
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France has offered the small
Mediterranean island a level of autonomy that no other French
region enjoys, including a limited right to modify laws voted in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is aimed at ending more than 25 years of bombings and
political assassinations by Corsican separatists fighting for the
island's independence. But it was rejected almost immediately by
island leaders, who said on Tuesday that Jospin had not gone far
enough.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Corsican National party, Jean Guy Talamoni,
dismissed the proposals as ``hasty improvisations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This text does not suit us,'' Talamoni said. ``It is null and
void.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he seemed encouraged by the offer, saying he had every
intention of returning to the negotiating table, where he thought
he could get a better deal.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin has been meeting regularly with the Corsican leaders
since a cease-fire was declared in December. But he has come under
fire from the right, and even from some of his own ministers, for
conducting negotiations with people who have refused to condemn
violence.
</P>
<P>
   His proposals _ unveiled at a Monday night meeting with Corsican
officials _ offer the right to modify laws on a limited basis,
though exactly how this would work remained an open question. It
would also give Corsica's local government a range of new powers in
areas such as economic development, education, transportation, and
environment.
</P>
<P>
   And, it calls for the Corsican language, a dialect of Italian,
to become an obligatory part of the school curriculum, unless a
parent asks for an exception.
</P>
<P>
   However, it leaves several thorny issues unresolved. For
instance, the Corsicans have been asking for a general amnesty for
those involved in the political violence and a release of
``political prisoners.'' But there is no mention of these issues.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin's plan drew immediate criticism from the right, which
warned that the new powers being offered would now be sought by
other regions and would undermine the French republic. But some
analysts dismissed this notion, saying that Corsica is unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other regions don't have this coherence,'' said Emmanuel
Negrier, an analyst with the National Center for Scientific
Research, a Paris based study group. ``Corsica is a very specific
place. It is an island. It is not urbanized. It is behind in many
socioeconomic ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Jospin began his initiative at a time when relations between the
island and France had been at a particularly low point. In 1998,
the highest-ranking French government official on the island,
Claude Erignac, was assassinated, while walking to meet his wife
for a classical music concert in Ajaccio, the island capital. He
was shot three times in the back and twice in the neck.
</P>
<P>
   When France sent in a successor with a get-tough approach, the
result was a scandal. The official, Bernard Bonnet, was removed
from office after he was accused of ordering police officers to set
fire to a restaurant that had been built illegally on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate that the vast majority of Corsicans, perhaps 85
percent, want to remain a part of France. But the island's
tumultuous politics _ it's 250,000 inhabitants have 14 parties to
choose from _ are dominated by nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   The Corsican Assembly will meet this week to give its official
answer to the plan.

 &HT;    Few common chords struck in hearing over music downloads
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A songwriting senator summoned rock stars and
dot.com entrepreneurs to testify Tuesday about whether there is an
``upside of downloading'' music on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican and singer-composer of
gospel and pop songs, called a hearing of the Senate Judiciary
Committee ``to learn more about the online music marketplace and
why there is so much disharmony.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee got an earful of the continuing cacophony over
online copyright protection.
</P>
<P>
   Lars Ulrich, drummer and co-founder of the band Metallica, said
his introduction to the problem came when the firm Napster
``hijacked our music without asking'' and enabled its subscribers
to duplicate the songs for free over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Hank Barry, the CEO of Napster, disagreed. He
said Napster's technology merely permits its 20 million members to
individually share their collections of digitalized music and that
such ``sampling'' actually promotes CD sales. On many campuses,
Napster is so popular that high-speed college computer systems are
sometimes clogged with students swapping music files called MP3's.
</P>
<P>
   Roger McGuinn, a songwriter and founder of folk-rock's Byrds
band, said he has gotten a better deal distributing his music over
his own Internet site and the online firm MP3.com than he ever did
when major labels controlled his hits like ``The Ballad of Easy
Rider.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fred Erlich, Sony Music's president of new technology, said
artists as well as record labels will suffer if the ``value chain''
is broken through free online distribution of their works and there
is no financial incentive to create and produce music.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses did strike a few common chords: The Internet has
already changed the way recorded music reaches consumers. Even in a
digital economy, there is intellectual property and artists should
be compensated for its creation. The issues go far beyond Napster,
a pioneering company that has generated far more controversy than
revenues. And justice has to keep up with technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must protect the rights of the creator,'' said Hatch. ``But
we cannot, in the name of copyright, unduly burden consumers and
the promising technology that the Internet presents to us all.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said the hearing was aimed at providing information rather
than writing legislation. Action on the issue will come sooner in
the courts than in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Metallica and the major record labels have filed lawsuits
charging Napster with copyright infringements. The record companies
also sued MP3.com over its plan to immediately put a digitalized
version of a CD on a customer's computer ``locker'' when they
bought the actual CD. The problem, according to the music industry,
was that MP3.com created a library of 45,000 copyrighted CDs to be
digitally send into the ``lockers'' rather than copying the actual
purchased CD.
</P>
<P>
   But Gene Kan, developer of Gnutella, another online music
distribution system, said the music industry had better recognize
that ``the toothpaste is already out of the tube'' and adjust.
While Napster is built upon a directory of members who exchange
music with each other, Gnutella's ``community'' is connected only
by a common software that they downloaded for free. The software
lets them exchange MP3 music files without passing through any sort
of central switchboard.
</P>
<P>
   Napster and Gnutella ``are like potlucks,'' Kan explained.
``Everyone brings what he or she wants to share and perhaps
partakes in what others brought.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like movie makers had to adjust to an era of easily copied
videotapes, record companies and artists themselves are going to
have to find a way to make a profit distributing music online, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But some other online music distribution systems are also upset
with Napster and Gnutella. Gene Hoffman, president of EMusic.com,
said his firm has licensing agreements with many artists and
independent record labels that allow him to sell downloaded CD
tracks for 99 cents apiece. But even at that price, he said, its
hard to compete with free tracks.

 &HT;    AOL, STRUGGLING ABROAD, LAUNCHES SERVICE IN MEXICO
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ America Online Inc. began offering Internet access
service in Mexico ON Tuesday, hoping to boost its lagging
subscriber base in Latin America while expanding its ranks of
Spanish-speaking U.S. customers.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said AOL needs a ``win'' in Mexico to show investors it
can get people in poorer countries to pay monthly fees for online
services, even as other companies offer free Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``All eyes are on them,'' said Will Landers, director of Latin
American technology research for Credit Suisse First Boston.
Analysts question whether AOL can succeed south of the U.S. border
because the company is ``very much tied to the subscription model.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Vienna, Va.-based online giant launched AOL
Brazil. But ``the rollout in Brazil was slower than what the market
expected,'' Landers said. Today, AOL is still running a distant
fourth among Internet providers in the Portuguese-speaking country,
in part because many Brazilians are getting free Internet access
from companies that rely solely on advertising for revenue.
</P>
<P>
   AOL Mexico plans to offer a 90-day free trial period, compared
with one free month in the United States. Mexican customers getting
unlimited access will be billed in pesos and will pay about $22 a
month, the same rate as U.S. customers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the price, some analysts believe AOL's emphasis on
``home grown'' content and child-friendly monitoring services may
attract paying customers. ``They're aiming at Mexican families,''
said Gabriel Moreno, a high-tech industry analyst for the
International Data Corp. research firm in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Because AOL offers subscribers seven user names under one
account, it opens up access to a whole family. ``Everyone can have
their own log-in and password, so parents can't read their
children's e-mail,'' Moreno said. ``But they can control what their
children look at.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL is the world's largest online service, with more than 23
million subscribers. But while the company has been phenomenally
successful in the United States, only a fraction of subscribers
lives abroad.
</P>
<P>
   After years of branching out into Europe, Asia and Latin
America, AOL is still seeing mixed results. In some European
countries, AOL dominates as an Internet access provider. But it has
done poorly in Japan, Australia and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is the poorest country where AOL has offered service.
Despite a population of roughly 100 million, only about 1.5 million
Mexicans have Internet accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Latin America is the fastest-growing Internet market in
the world. Analysts estimate that region's the number of users will
shoot from 8.5 million today to 29.4 million by 2003, according to
International Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish-language content of AOL Mexico will be available at
no increased cost to U.S.-based AOL subscribers, which means
Mexican-born residents in this country will have access to content
produced by 70 AOL staffers in Mexico City, spokeswoman Tricia
Primrose said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the number of Spanish-speaking people in the United
States, this will be an exciting development here, too,'' Primrose
said.
</P>
<P>
   AOL Mexico will be operated as part of a joint venture with the
Cisneros Group, a Venezuelan media company that produces popular
soap operas and owns Univision, the largest Spanish-language
television network in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   AOL Mexico's competitors include Telefonos de Mexico (TelMex),
Spain's Terra Networks SA and Starmedia Network Inc.

THE BISTROS OF YESTERYEAR? FLOURISHING 
</HEADLINE>
   By R.W. APPLE Jr.    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The word ``bistro'' is used as promiscuously in Paris as
the word ``deli'' is used in New York.
</P>
<P>
   There are Greek bistros, Chinese bistros, Mexican bistros, cafes
that call themselves bistros and steak-frites joints that call
themselves bistros. Bistros are hot, and every quick-franc artist
in town wants to cash in.
</P>
<P>
   Bistros in the true sense _ the name comes from a Russian word
meaning quick _ were riding high when I first ate my merry way
around the French capital in the 1960s. Then, you could still find
most of the places that A.J. Liebling had haunted 25 years before.
But they soon went into decline, and when a revival came in the
1980s, it produced restaurants that were bistros in name only. The
decor was right _ lacquered wood storefronts, bare floors, even
zinc bars _ but not the food.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, Paris is a conservative city, slow-changing and
resistant to ``progress,'' and quite a few of the genuine articles
survive. Lovers of the sturdy, copious, grandmotherly cooking that
marks a true bistro pass favorite addresses from hand to hand, like
Russians in the communist era exchanging samizdat manuscripts. The
guidebooks may forget, but die-hard bistro owners and clients,
Frenchmen and foreigners alike, tend the flame.
</P>
<P>
   I count myself among the more avid members of that fraternity,
and my wife, Betsey, is no less keen. For us, Darroze and
Taillevent and Gagnaire are shrines to be visited occasionally, not
crammed into a single week's visit to Paris; bistros are for
relaxed, restorative, everyday chow.
</P>
<P>
   Much of it is based on humble ingredients, transformed into
culinary gold by the alchemy of slow simmering with wine and herbs.
This is the food of artisans, not artists, of guardians of
tradition, not trailblazers.
</P>
<P>
   Pot-au-feu, stuffed cabbage, navarin d'agneau, poulet au
vinaigre _ dishes like those have been and still are the mainstays
of bistro cooking. So are frogs' legs and snails, tripe and
kidneys, and old-school desserts like oeufs a la neige (floating
island) and tarte Tatin.
</P>
<P>
   No proper bistro has designer lighting, none have a maitre
d'hotel and none have Muzak. You go to eat and drink, not to
impress a client or pitch woo.
</P>
<P>
   On our last few visits to Paris, Betsey and I have revisited
most of the places on my bistro list. Here are up-to-date reports
on four of the top spots, with briefer notes on others where we
enjoyed ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   BENOIT (20 rue St.-Martin, Fourth Arrondissement,
011-33-1-42-72-25-76).
</P>
<P>
   Like a woman who wears too much makeup, Benoit has an air of
slightly suspicious glamour. Is the velvet too red, the brass too
shiny? No, it's la vraie chose, genuine down to the last potted
palm. Founded in 1912 by Benoit Martray, it has been faithfully
tended for four decades by Michel Petit, his grandson.
</P>
<P>
   That's Martray in the photo on the back wall, a beret perched
jauntily on his head and double chins deployed proudly beneath it.
His face is creased by a big smile. Jean, the handsome, cheeky
waiter, smiles, too.
</P>
<P>
   Petit is one of the last bistrotiers who buy Beaujolais in casks
and bottle it in their own cellars, in bottles identified only by a
tiny neck label. It is always a good choice.
</P>
<P>
   The food follows tradition, up to a point. In small, judicious
ways, Petit constantly strives for lighter, more contemporary
versions of the classics, with no discernible loss of flavor. There
is more parsley and less garlic in the snail butter; the hearty,
gelatinous veal knuckle is served with a barely thickened tomato
sauce; beef cheeks, with their more delicate texture, go into a
stew rather than heftier cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But you need not fear asparagus ice cream or foie gras with
rhubarb or some other abomination committed in the name of
innovation.
</P>
<P>
   The cassoulet is ideal winter fare. In hot summer weather, a
sumptuous dish of jellied fish _ a kind of cold bouillabaisse _
sometimes appears on the menu. Summer is the season as well for the
masterstroke among the restaurant's desserts, a luscious charlotte
of raspberries and wild strawberries. It is more than enough, all
by itself, to justify the star that the Michelin guide gives
Benoit. No other bistro is so honored.
</P>
<P>
   CHEZ GEORGES (1 rue de Mail, Second Arrondissement,
011-33-1-42-60-07-11).
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Brouillet's menu is still produced on an old Metro
liquid duplicator, in the red-purple script that used to be
synonymous with bistros, and the long, skinny room is still lined
with oversize mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   This is a busy, happy place, with a fine, rosy glow, where old
friends celebrate and new friends are made. Everyone talks to
everyone else, glad to be tucking into the seared onglet (hanger
steak), a tasty, chewy slab of meat showered with minced shallots,
or the excellent offal _ grilled veal kidneys with bearnaise sauce,
calf's liver topped with a thick rasher of bacon in the English
style, or veal sweetbreads in a mushroom cream sauce.
</P>
<P>
   The service is handled by charming women who have been around
since some of the bankers on whom they wait at lunch were tellers.
One of the many small pleasures of Georges is watching them fillet
the sole (a house specialty, served with a white wine sauce) with
the deftness of neurosurgeons.
</P>
<P>
   This is a neighborhood of temptations. Kenzo is two steps away,
Dehellerin's cookware store two more. The greatest of all, however,
is the bistro's wine list, packed with old Burgundies and Bordeaux
at prices half of those you would pay in a two- or three-star
gastronomic temple. Not cheap, mind you _ something 10 to 25 years
old from Dujac or Comte Armand will set you back $75 to $250 _ but
very reasonable for what you get.
</P>
<P>
   How do they do it? Some of the most famous growers, whose wines
are carefully rationed, have been supplying Chez Georges, and
eating there, for decades. The Marquis d'Angerville nipped in for
lunch just a few days before our most recent visit.
</P>
<P>
   LA GRILLE (80 rue du Fauburg-Poisonniere, 10th Arrondissement,
011-33-1-47-70-89-73).
</P>
<P>
   ``The egg is from the country, Monsieur,'' the jolly waiter
said, urging me to order the oeuf en gelee as a first course. It
was, and it was cooked to perfection, the yellow-gold yolk a little
more than soft-boiled. A small scallop of ham and a half-dozen
leaves of tarragon also helped to transform something that might
have been banal into a work of aspic art.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it is at La Grille. Order a frisee salad and the
curly lettuce comes to the table with its crown of bacon strips
still steaming from the pan, as it should be and seldom is. Skinny
little lamb chops are delectable, says Betsey, the lamb expert.
Chocolate mousse, so dark and rich it looks almost black, is
exquisitely under-sweetened.
</P>
<P>
   But La Grille's centerpiece is the tawny turbot, with a lattice
of dark bars expertly seared into its flesh by la grille under the
baleful eye of the chef and owner, Yves Cullerre, he of the silver
handlebar mustache. It comes with a tart, ivory-hued beurre blanc.
In addition, you should order the little discus of sliced potatoes
baked with butter, plus the house Sancerre from Domaine Tabordet.
</P>
<P>
   There is something profoundly reassuring about the dozens of
coats of dark red lacquer on the walls, the circular staircase
leading up to the loos, the lace and embroidery at the windows and
on the banquettes. Here, you sense, the modern world is held at
bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the last dinosaurs,'' the dumpling-shaped Mme. Cullerre
told us on our last visit, ``and we want to do things this way to
the end of our days.''
</P>
<P>
   L'AMI LOUIS (32 rue du Vertbois, Third Arrondissement,
011-33-1-48-87-77-48).
</P>
<P>
   In all the years I have been visiting this little bistro, on a
seedy side street in a banal neighborhood, it has never been listed
in the Michelin guide. The flaking dirt-brown paint on the walls,
the worn-out floor tiles and the tired tin ceiling evidently fall
short of the red book's decor requirements.
</P>
<P>
   French critics love to trash the place, not least because it has
so many American clients and because it charges such high prices;
the two things are probably not unrelated.
</P>
<P>
   When I started going there, more than 25 years ago, L'Ami Louis
had very few American clients, and no one spoke any English.
Antoine Magnin, then considered the city's master rotisseur, or
roaster, was still at his post, red kerchief tied round his neck,
and Louis Gadby, now the patron, was a young waiter. The wine list
was much slimmer (so was I) and cheaper. Nobody dreamed of calling
weeks in advance for a table, as they do now.

 &HT;    Bush staff continues to play it close to the vest
 &HT;    By Ken Herman

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _Here's what it's come to, above, on the fruited
plane.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by the George W. Bush campaign's ability to keep
secrets, the travelling press recently turned to citrus in an
effort to squeeze some information out of the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ridge too liberal? Yes or no,'' a reporter, seeking a hint on
Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge's chances at being the running mate,
wrote on an orange that was then rolled to Bush in first class.
</P>
<P>
   ``No comment,'' came the non-reply scribbled by Bush on the
orange.
</P>
<P>
   The reporters, ready with follow-up fruit, persisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it Keating? Yes or no,'' they asked on a second orange,
seeking information on Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Same,'' wrote Bush.
</P>
<P>
   For months, as Bush filled the time between clinching the
nomination in March and formally getting it next month in
Philadelphia, the campaign has been extraordinarily successful at
controlling the flow and leakage of information. Today, some of
that information may be shared at closed-door meetings with 150 top
Republicans from around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Bush backers began gathering Tuesday at the Hyatt Regency for
sessions, organized by the Republican National Committee, that will
be highlighted by a public speech today by Bush and a private
briefing from Karl Rove, the campaign's quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``This conference will help us take the next important step in
the Republican campaign of ideas,'' said Fred Meyer, former Texas
GOP chairman who is Bush's hand-picked chairman of the national
party's Victory 2000 effort to elect Republicans across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The behind-closed-door buzz is expected to include the ongoing
search for a running mate and talk about who might get what job in
a Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   On the record, Bush aides and confidantes _ fearing the
overconfident and arrogant label _ steer clear of talking about
anything beyond campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The official word is the campaign is focused on our convention
and on Election Day. Our thoughts and planning and focus are all
leading up to Nov. 7,'' campaign spokesman Ray Sullivan said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That means the campaign maintains the charade that nothing
involving transition is going on, preferring to have voters believe
the leadership team for the western world would be put together
between Nov. 7 and Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
   The charade is pierced by word from a Bush confidante that
transition talks, not surprisingly, have gone on, if not at a
formal level.
</P>
<P>
   The point man on transition for now is Clay Johnson, who serves
as top man in the governor's office. Johnson was a prep school
classmate of Bush. They were roommates at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the current administration when Bush became governor
in 1995. Prior to that, he served as chief operation officer of the
Dallas Museum of Art and president of Horchow Mail Order, a gift
business that became a division of Neiman Marcus in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Though some have targeted Johnson as the probable head of
transition if Bush wins, he downplays his current role, identifying
it only as ``repository'' of all information relating to a possible
transition.
</P>
<P>
   Early speculation on who could wind up as Bush's White House
chief of staff centers on Don Evans, the Bush buddy and former
business partner who ran the campaign fund-raising operation that
broke all records and helped buy the nomination for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Evans is chief executive officer of Tom Brown Inc., an energy
company. Bush formally served on the company's board. Evans is a
Bush appointee as chairman of the University of Texas System
regents.
</P>
<P>
   While the selection of White House staff is all speculative, and
may never be needed, the choice of a running mate is imminent. The
Bush staff continues to play it close to the vest. Around the
country, potential running mates are filling out questionnaires
prepared by former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Bush's one-man
search committee.
</P>
<P>
   In Oklahoma City, Keating spokesman Dan Mahoney knows the rules
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has done his part,'' said Mahoney, confirming that his boss
has submitted what amounts to an application. ``It needs to remain
a confidential process and that's what we are going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. John Kasich of Ohio is singing a similar tune.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is that Dick Cheney asked me to get them some
information,'' he said this week. ``I have been contacted. That is
all I will say, period.''
</P>
<P>
   As the contenders open their lives and records to Bush, the
campaign also is fielding input, invited and otherwise, from around
the country. A California-based group, eager to see a female
president, wants Bush to pick Elizabeth Dole, a choice that looks
like a long-shot. A Houston-based group has a Friday appointment to
submit petitions with 10,000 signatures from people who want Kasich
on the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The purveyors of uninvited input say the Bush campaign has been,
ahem, a bit difficult to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Courteous would be an overstatement,'' said one person trying
to have input from the outside. ``I don't see much interest. My
phone calls have not been returned.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a group headed by conservative activist Richard
Viguerie is touting the results of its survey of conservative
leaders they won't identify. Posted on the group's website _
bushrunningmate.com _ are survey results worded in an odd, negative
tone.
</P>
<P>
   The organization opted to highlight who the 183 survey
respondents don't want on the ticket, rather than who they do. Not
surprisingly, the more moderate, the more objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, Ridge, Govs. Christie Whitman of New Jersey and George
Pataki of New York, and Arizona Sen. John McCain ``topped the list
of possible running mates who might cause problems for Bush,'' the
group said.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents' favorite vice presidential candidates included U.S.
Reps. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, Chris Cox of California and Kasich of
Ohio, as well as Colin Powell and Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   The insider input on vice presidential selection has flowed from
people like Connecticut GOP Chairman Chris DePino, who is among
those whose opinions were sought by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   DePino has told Bush to pick Ridge, an abortion rights advocate
whose selection could upset religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the party is ready to accept the fact that we can
disagree on issues concerning abortion but we can agree on winning
elections,'' said DePino. ``If we can stay focused on that I don't
think there is a better candidate than Ridge.''

 PARIS: do now.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It all makes me feel like Methuselah. But every qualm vanishes
with the first magnificent mouthful of the juicy roast chicken, the
tender leg of baby lamb or the enormous rib of beef. They are
unmatched anywhere. The notably garlicky snails, scallops and
potato cake can, I admit, wreak havoc on the digestion, but for me
at least, they're worth the heartburn.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the high prices, of course, is prime ingredients.
All over Paris this spring, restaurateurs told me that French
morels were almost unobtainable. They had been forced, several
confessed, to substitute inferior Turkish mushrooms. Not Gadby: He
showed us a big basket full of the fattest morels imaginable, which
came from Compiegne, just outside Paris. Cooked with plenty of
cream, they tasted even better than they looked. Well, they might
have; they had cost 800 francs a kilo, or $50 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   Two tips: Order one portion for two, and go not for dinner but
for lunch, especially on Sunday, when the clientele are often all
French.
</P>
<P>
   ALLARD (41 rue St.-Andre-des-Arts, Sixth Arrondissement,
011-33-1-43-26-48-23).
</P>
<P>
   Some of the soul went out of this most famous of bistros, once
the holder of two Michelin stars, when Andre Allard died and his
wife, Fernande, retired. But after years in gastronomic purgatory,
it is once again full at lunch and dinner (now served until 11:30)
almost every day. The resurrection is the work of Claude Leyrac, an
experienced bistrotier, who has had the sense to keep many old
favorites on the list: The world's best cucumber salad, crunchy and
creamy; the famous duckling with olives; the lip-smacking beef and
veal and lamb stews, and a baked custard my mother would have
envied.
</P>
<P>
   CARTET (62 rue de Malte, 11th Arrondissement,
011-33-1-48-05-17-65).
</P>
<P>
   When Marie-Antoinette Cartet ran this eight-table bistro near
the Place de la Republique, it was open only for lunch; in the
evenings, she told me, she liked to go to the theater. When
Marie-Therese and Raymond Nouaille took over 20 years ago, they
started serving dinner and installed a new kitchen. But the menu is
immutable. No one in Paris serves silkier brandade de morue, a
blend of salt cod, potatoes, garlic, cream and olive oil. And what
could be homier than Cartet's boeuf a la ficelle, a fillet
suspended in a pot of boiling stock and simmered gently, or its
lemon tart, as warmly golden as the summer sun?
</P>
<P>
   CHEZ JOSEPHINE (117 rue du Cherche-Midi, Sixth Arrondissement,
011-33-1-45-48-52-40).
</P>
<P>
   Extravagant flower displays provide islands of color in
Jean-Christian Dumonet's two sober dining rooms, and luxury abounds
on his carte. He makes a specialty of truffles, in nonpareil
omelets and ragouts, and he combines perfectly cooked langoustines
with a tangle of herbs and lettuces in a rich man's salad. But most
dishes can be ordered in half portions, which helps hold down costs
and calories. At lunch on Wednesdays, the classic leg of lamb with
white beans should not be missed; other days I favor the dark, winy
boeuf bourguignon. And mon Dieu, the wines! Two large, closely
printed pages list red Bordeaux stretching back to 1928 at
eminently fair prices.
</P>
<P>
   CHEZ SAVY (23 rue Bayard, Eighth Arrondissement,
011-33-1-47-23-46-98).
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1923, Savy, an island of culinary modesty amid oceans
of gastronomic pretension in one of the city's richest
neighborhoods, has roots in the Auvergne, the deeply rural center
of France. The varied local clientele, including personalities from
nearby television stations, order the petit farcou, a fat,
chlorophyll-laden pancake of spinach, chard, leeks and herbs, and
the slow-cooked shoulder of lamb, falling off the bone. A jug of
Cahors and prime regional cheeses like Cantal and Roquefort will
make you purr. Eat in the narrow front room, called le wagon
(dining car) by habitues.
</P>
<P>
   LA TOUR DE MONTLHERY (5 rue des Prouvaires, First
Arrondissement, 011-33-1-42-36-21-82).
</P>
<P>
   This is a set designer's vision of a bistro, with sausages
dangling from the ceiling, red-checked cloths on the tables and
customers with Gauloises dangling from their lips. Beaujolais is
drawn straight from a barrel at the bar. I don't know which are
more Rabelaisian _ the cheerful rabble you'll find at the next
table, or the vast portions of mutton with white beans, pigs' feet
and profiteroles. A survivor of the old Halles market district, La
Tour is open 24 hours every weekday. Pot-au-feu every Thursday;
service with just the right touch of impertinence every day.
</P>
<P>
   CHEZ LA VIEILLE (1 rue Bailleul, First Arrondissement,
011-33-1-42-60-15-78).
</P>
<P>
   Adrienne Biasin, the old woman for whom this hole-in-the-wall
was named, has retired, but her bistro is bubblier, better and more
generous than ever, thanks to the new owner, the chic Marie-Josee
Cervoni. A Corsican, she has added tastes of her homeland to the
menu, including a raw ham reminiscent of Smithfield. You order a
main course (perhaps the beef stew with carrots) and help yourself
to the half-dozen starters and half-dozen desserts served family
style. Among the former, a boar terrine, well-seasoned stuffed
cabbage and a refreshing mussel and tomato salad stand out; among
the latter, prunes in red wine. Drink the peppery St.-Joseph from
the Rhone.
</P>
<P>
   Which is to say nothing of Chardenoux, and Aux Charpentiers, and
Chez Rene, and Moissonier ...

 &HT;    Real entrepreneurs roll with the times
 &HT;    By Caroline Hubbard
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Lindsey Cook calmly sipped a beer a week after firing
half of his employees.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive of nschool.com, Cook had spent his day
trying to convince someone to buy the remains of his company.
</P>
<P>
   Things were bad.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, when asked if he would start another Internet company, the
40-year-old didn't hesitate. ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Weeks later, he had a tentative agreement with another company.
Things were looking up. He stood at a crowded trade show, calmly
chatting with his acquaintances and remaining employees. Will he
start another company? ``Yes.'' Again, no hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fun,'' he said. ``It is not about starting something.
It is about building something.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes a true entrepreneur to ride the roller coaster, to take
the failures and successes with a certain calm. But at a time when
things are newly tough, when starting an Internet company no longer
feels like a sure thing, the weak entrepreneurs are being weeded
out. Experts say we will see fewer people take the leap from cushy
jobs to start-ups. We will see plenty return to BellSouth and
Arthur Andersen and McKinsey. Those same experts agree the shift
may be a good thing; several months ago, too many people were
jumping on the bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are getting back to the real entrepreneur. There for a
while, we had doctors, lawyers and Indian chiefs bailing out of
conventional jobs,'' said George Levert, a partner at Kinetic
Ventures and a 20-year veteran of the Atlanta venture capital
scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truly dedicated people you can't slap down. The people who
are going away don't have that drive, that fierce tenacity and
belief in what they are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook thinks it is about discipline as much as dedication. A
trial attorney for many years, Cook grimaces at the thought of
returning to the courtroom but says he learned there how to manage
stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``You discipline yourself,'' he said. ``You decide, these are
the parameters of how freaked out I will get. You say, 'I am not
going to go any lower than this.' And you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   For Rod Robinson, it is flexibility. Last summer, Robinson
started GlobalMecca.com, an Internet company aimed at black
professionals. He tried for many months to get capital to market
his site but never found investors. Eventually, he changed his
business plan and began a trial partnership with a large financial
services company. He said the partnership could lead to the
financial services company buying GlobalMecca, though he is keeping
quiet on the details for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is staying power,'' said Robinson, thinking back
over the last year. ``You could easily fold up the tent and go
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson also said he has learned to act positively even when he
feels down.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have brought people on board who are not entrepreneurs,''
he said. ``They go through some rough times when times are tough.
You have to constantly to be a cheerleader.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only are fewer people starting companies, fewer people are
willing to work for still-young companies.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Steele, chief executive at Atlanta start-up enfoTrust, said
he has seen the job market shift. ``People are less willing to
leave their companies ... They are taking a wait-and-see
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Esler, a consultant on the technology team at recruiting
firm Egon Zehnder International, said executives are doing more
research on start-ups. Six months ago, people wanted to know how
much equity they got and how long until the company planned to go
public, according to Esler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they are asking, 'Does this company have a compelling
value proposition?''' Esler said.
</P>
<P>
   At FigLeaves, an e-commerce company that has been hit hard by
the Internet shakeout, some executives want another shot at the
start-up dream.
</P>
<P>
   And some don't. Chief Executive Ari Straus said he will
definitely work at another early stage company. But some members of
his management team are not so sure. One recently took a job at
UPS.
</P>
<P>
   Straus _ who previously worked at conservative companies such as
Kurt Salmon Associates and Deloitte Consulting _ said plenty of
people are tiring of the risky start-up life.
</P>
<P>
   ``People went panning for gold,'' he said. ``They didn't find it
and now are hopping back on their wagons and heading east as fast
as they can.''

   Does a firm handshake really earn you a better first impression?
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely, says a University of Alabama research team. And
that's not all. Your handshake may be a window to your soul.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty heavy stuff for a couple of seconds of skin-to-skin
contact, but that's what happens when researchers get curious about
handshake etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   Led by William Chaplin, associate professor at the University of
Alabama's Tuscaloosa campus, the researchers evaluated the
handshakes of 112 study participants. Qualities measured included
strength and duration, dryness, temperature, vigor and presence of
eye contact. In addition, the participants completed four
personality questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
   Handshakes, the study found, stay consistent upon repetitions _
that is, firm handshakers stayed firm and ``limp fishes'' stayed
limp.
</P>
<P>
   And interestingly, there was some correlation between handshake
qualities and personality. Firm handshakers tended to be extroverts
and more open to new experiences than those with limp handshakes,
the researchers found. And the firm handshakers garnered more
positive impressions than the limp fishes.
</P>
<P>
   No surprises there for Sue Fox, a Los Gatos, Calif.-based
business etiquette consultant and author of the forthcoming book,
Business Etiquette for Dummies (IDG Books). ``If you think about
it, it's your first physical contact with someone, so why not make
that first physical contact a positive one?'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   To Fox, a limp handshake telegraphs that ``you're sort of
apologetic and hesitant and kind of lifeless. You want to show that
you're kind of enthusiastic and happy to meet this person.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaplin says a chance question from some undergraduates was what
started all the handshaking. The students wanted to know whether
there was any scientific basis to what etiquette consultants and
management trainers have always contended _ that a firm handshake
is key to making a positive first impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I knew, no one had ever really studied it, but
certainly there was a great deal of opinion on it,'' Chaplin says.
Finding only limited mentions of handshaking and personality in
their search of the literature, Chaplin and his students decided to
create their own project.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there's more to studying handshakes than sticking out
your hand and smiling. Chaplin and the student testers had to
thrash out such ideas as ``a neutral way to initiate a handshake''
_ palm facing to the left, thumb raised at a 45-degree angle _ so
that the study participants would set the tone of the handshake
rather than the researchers. The team also had to agree upon what
exactly constituted clamminess, limpness, firmness and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Tricky as it can be, it was important that human beings measured
and rated the handshakes, Chaplin says. ``We could measure
handshakes with machines, but I don't think that would be about
handshaking as a whole. It would be about how strong your grip
was.''
</P>
<P>
   What surprises Chaplin most about the results? ``I was struck by
the finding that women who had a firmer handshake were being
evaluated by the testers as positively as the men,'' he says.
``That was a little bit at odds with the typical finding in the
literature [on gender differences] where women who assume a
positive, strong attitude are more negatively viewed.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice as that is to know, what do you do if you're naturally a
boneless sort? Is it possible to firm things up?
</P>
<P>
   Chaplin says he isn't quite sure. ``A handshake is very
automatic,'' he says. To change it, ``you need to become conscious
of it, think about it, and that would make it become a little bit
unnatural and communicate other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox is more optimistic _ and pragmatic. If you need a firm
handshake for crucial situations, there's no reason you can't
summon one up, she says. ``Maybe you can't change it overnight, but
it's just a level of awareness,'' she says. ``Fake it if you have
to. After a while, it becomes a habit if you keep doing it.''

&HT;     THINK TWICE BEFORE FLYING WITH YOUR PET THIS SUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JULIE COOPER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ If you thought traveling with kids was tough, try
checking Fido as luggage this summer. You can't. And if you show up
at the airport without making prior arrangements for the family
pet, you'll be in for a rude awakening.
</P>
<P>
   Most major airlines have changed their policies on flying the
pets as checked luggage after a number of incidents involving
animal deaths or near deaths on domestic airliners.
</P>
<P>
   Each airline has its own rules. Southwest Airlines accepts no
pets, only guide dogs, while TWA has a $75 fee for small pets in
the cabin and cargo area (not checked luggage). American,
Continental, Delta and United announced they would no longer accept
pets as baggage during the hot, busy summer months.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: If you must travel with Fluffy, allow extra
check-in time, get an approved carrier or crate, and have the
animal checked by a veterinarian. Most important _ book early.
Remember that pets in the cabin must be small enough to fit under
the seat in front of you, and all the airlines limit the number per
plane (usually two in coach and one in first class).
</P>
<P>
   ``Traveling with your pet presents many unique challenges, but
because most pet lovers consider their pets as family, they
wouldn't dream of leaving them home alone,'' said Dr. Marty Becker,
Petopia.com's chief veterinary correspondent and co-author of
``Chicken Soup for the Cat and Dog Lover's Soul.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With careful planning, traveling with your pet can be a
wonderful bonding experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Army Staff Sgt. Keith Thompson, who is stationed in San Antonio,
has flown several times with Bailey, a Shetland sheepdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had any problems traveling with Bailey, except that
most (domestic) airlines make me feel like I'm traveling with a
convicted felon that must be caged instead of a member of my
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said he got exceptional treatment when he was transferred
to Japan and flew on ANA, All Nippon Airways.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and Bailey got the royal treatment when they arrived
in Tokyo,'' Thompson said. ``Someone from the airline personally
escorted my wife through customs and ensured that all of Bailey's
paperwork was in order and that they made it to their connecting
flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Minneapolis-based Northwest Airlines gets high marks for its
Priority Pet program and continues to accept pets as checked
baggage during the summer months, although restrictions apply.
Animals are not accepted when temperatures exceed 85 degrees at any
point on the itinerary. Northwest charges $75 each way for pet
transport _ both inside the cabin and checked _ for domestic
flights, and the international rate varies.
</P>
<P>
   Valinda Satterlee, whose husband serves with the Air Force in
Japan, said Northwest ``was wonderful and seemed to really care
about our four-legged family members.''
</P>
<P>
   Satterlee traveled to Japan with two children and three Lhasa
Apsos last September. They plan to return to San Antonio in 2002
when Dan Satterlee retires from the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had two dogs in cargo because at 18 pounds they were 3
pounds over the allowed weight for carry-on pets with Northwest.
All three dogs did very well in both compartments,'' Satterlee
says.
</P>
<P>
   Airline Internet sites are the best places to get information
about traveling with pets, although other pet-related sites such as
the Human Society at www.hsus.org, Petopia.com, Pets.com and
Kindplanet.org are helpful sites on pet travel.
</P>
<P>
   Most airlines are accepting large dogs from professional pet
shippers. For more information about shipping pets, contact the
Independent Pet and Animal Transportation Association, 903-769-2267
or on the Internet at www.ipata.com.
</P>
<P>
   Air Animal, www.airanimal.com, works with pet owners and
airlines to assure ``pets are getting the best care possible'' for
transportation domestically and internationally.
</P>
<P>
   Air Animal's founder, Dr. Walter Wolf, is a veterinarian with 40
years' experience. He said people who expected to pay $50 to
transport a pet are finding that it cost upwards of $550 now. Last
year Air Animal moved more than 3,000 cats and dogs around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to the airport and checking a dog, I believe that has
come to an end,'' Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
   He does have praise for some airlines, such as Continental.
Continental Quickpak live animal rates for pets as cargo range from
$139 for pets up to 18 pounds to $299 for pets of 120 pounds. For
more information, call the live animal desk at 800-575-3335.
</P>
<P>
   ``Continental has dedicated itself to providing the services in
an extremely controlled circumstances,'' Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he has any tips for those flying with pets, Wolf said
``people are going to have to look at alternative plans, dig deep
in their pockets or wait until September.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, many boarding kennels are at or near capacity
this summer. If you decide to board your pet, book soon.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prompted by their prime minister's weakness and the
peace talks in Maryland, leaders of Israel's peace movement tried
Tuesday to awaken their followers to action.
</P>
<P>
   They fight a reputation for being dormant while their right-wing
opponents canvas the streets with banners, hold hunger strikes,
pray at the sacred Western Wall and take out newspaper ads.
</P>
<P>
   They labor under a feeling that their sluggishness in 1995 may
have helped foster the atmosphere for the assassination of
then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the same as today, when you had the feeling that they
were the only ones in the street,'' Galia Golan-Gild, an activist
for 22 years with Peace Now, said of her right-wing rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we could have affected what happened,'' Golan
said. ``But there's a feeling that we should be doing more to
protect our leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Their leader is in trouble again.
</P>
<P>
   After just a year in office, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
government is faltering under assault from opponents to peace
negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Peace Coalition, a collection of Peace Now and
smaller pro-peace groups, held a rally Tuesday evening on the
street near Barak's official residence.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,500 people attended to hear speeches and folk songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like Barak is doing the right thing, but he doesn't
get enough support, especially from people out in the streets,''
student Ori Mosenzon, 30, said at the rally. ``Many people who
support him are quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show the country about evenly split on the talks. Barak
has promised to put any peace deal before the people in a public
referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The peace activists' icon, Rabin, was assassinated by a lone
gunman after a huge peace rally Nov. 4, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The attack and the rally came after right-wing activists had
assailed Rabin repeatedly as a traitor. Many pro-peace Israelis
feel not enough was done to answer the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Similar accusations are now turned on Barak.
</P>
<P>
   During Tuesday's demonstration, police lined up around eight
counter-protestors from the radical anti-Arab Kach movement. They
chanted, ``He's a traitor,'' and held anti-Barak signs, including
one stating, ``Barak, the nation will deal with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Kach activist Noam Federman said that if Barak uproots Jewish
settlements in the West Bank, ``He should be prepared for people to
do violent things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how I will react,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Kach is on the extreme end of the right-wing movement in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli television news report Tuesday said a new Internet
Website allows people to simulate shooting at Barak.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The major opponent of the summit remains the settler movement,
which is effective at conventional grassroots tactics.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 200,000 settlers in the West Bank, land
which Israel captured in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, and is now up
for negotiation in the Camp David talks.
</P>
<P>
   Yehudit Tayar, spokeswoman for the settlers council, said the
group could spend millions of dollars, if necessary, on a campaign
against concessions in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said he may require about 40,000 settlers to move from
their land or be under Palestinian control. Tayar said polling
showed her group hit a ``raw nerve'' with its new slogan:
``Brothers are not abandoned.''
</P>
<P>
   It harkens, she said, to the Israeli army philosophy that
comrades cannot be left behind in battle.
</P>
<P>
   The new peace movement slogan is: ``The majority chooses peace.
I do too.'' Peace Now spokesman Didi Remez said his group has only
spent about $50,000 on the effort and cannot approach the settler's
treasury.

<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ Midday traffic slips easily down Main Street
outside Tommy's Tavern, where Bob Fleagle leans against the
horseshoe-shaped bar and sips a cold Pabst Blue-Ribbon straight
from the can.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes' drive away, up the winding road into the forested
mountains where Fleagle and his pals have been catching small-mouth
bass and hunting wild mushrooms since they were boys, President
Clinton is huddling with Israeli and Palestinian leaders in hopes
of bringing peace to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope it's workable,'' proffers Fleagle, 50, taking a
break from his carpentry work at the tiny zoo down the road. ``Any
time countries are fighting like that, there's no good can come out
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nestled into the verdant bosom of the Catoctin Mountains, in the
shadow of the Camp David presidential retreat, tiny Thurmont
(population: 4,400), has become the focal point for global efforts
to end a half-century of conflict between Israelis and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Folks like Fleagle can remember the Israeli-Egyptian peace talks
at nearby Camp David in 1978. More than two decades later, many
here believe the time for peace has come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just hoping and hoping that they wind up working something
out for those people over there,'' said Holly Bailey, owner of a
florist shop in town. ``It's a shame they've got to be over there
fighting and everything. It's just really sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Settled nearly three centuries ago by a handful of pioneer
families fleeing religious persecution in their native Germany,
Thurmont is no stranger to intractable conflict.
</P>
<P>
   It sits right between two major Civil War battles: Gettysburg,
15 miles to the North; and roughly the same distance to the South,
the spot on the Monocacy River where a Union artillery battery held
off Confederate soldiers trying to attack Washington, 70 miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   Culturally, though, Thurmont _ the name comes from a German word
that means ``gateway to the mountains'' _ is worlds away from
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A place where the local fireman's carnival still provides a set
piece to a summer of crab cakes, ham sandwiches and fresh tomatoes,
Thurmont knows the term ``Rose Garden,'' not as a White House stage
but rather as the home of Jim and Mary Eyler.
</P>
<P>
   For 44 years, the Eylers have raised roses _ more than 300
plants, including the shoulder-high row that fences off their lawn
from pedestrians and youngsters on bikes _ at their two-story home
at the corner of Main and Carroll streets.
</P>
<P>
   Descendants of the town's frontier settlers, the Eylers _ both,
82 _ sat Tuesday at a kitchen table dominated by a lazy susan
crammed with more than two dozen bottles of prescription drugs, and
shook their heads at the prospects for Mideast peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since time began somewhere over there there's been
fighting, there's been war,'' said Mary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Clinton pulls this off, it'll surprise me,'' she said. ``He
won't.''

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Call it revenge of the wrench-turners.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago at the Semicon West trade conference here, talk
among attendees was about how lousy it was for them and how
ridiculously good it was for the newly monied dot-com crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, how times have changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dot-coms are dying,'' said John Thompson of Milliken &AMP;
Co., based in LaGrange, Ga., with just a bit of a smirk, at this
year's expo for chip company suppliers, being held in San Francisco
and in San Jose this week.
</P>
<P>
   One of an estimated 60,000 attendees at this year's Semicon
West, Thompson is in a decidedly low-tech part of the high-tech
industry. Milliken makes and sells clean room wipers _
super-sterile rags, essentially, used in semiconductor clean rooms.
</P>
<P>
   While many dot-coms and other tech types are in the financial
dumper, the nuts-and-bolts companies that keep semiconductor
companies running _ makers of everything from sophisticated silicon
etching equipment to stainless steel pipes and valves, industrial
gasses and wipers _ are having the best time they've had in years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Semiconductor equipment sales are expected to grow by nearly
37 percent this year, equipment companies estimated in a Semicon
survey. That's up from 18 percent growth last year and a whole lot
better than the dismal 22 percent drop in business two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   _ The hottest new electronics goods are more dependent on
semiconductors than ever before. As much as half of the cost of
personal digital assistants such as Palm Pilots, for instance, goes
to pay for the semiconductors inside them, according to a study by
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. By comparison, semiconductor costs
account for about 25 percent to 33 percent of the price of a
typical personal computer and 8 percent to 10 percent of the cost
of a mainframe computer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Along with strong demand, more efficient production methods
are prompting chip companies to invest in new equipment and
factories at levels not seen in years. At least 15 chip
manufacturers are planning to build new factories or revamp old
ones around the world in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recovery remains in full-force,'' said Stanley Myers,
president and chief executive of Semiconductor Equipment and
Materials International, or SEMI, the trade group that sponsors
Semicon. ``The promise of a major ramp-up in semiconductor
manufacturing in 2000 is being realized.''
</P>
<P>
   All of that is good news in Austin, which is home to more
domestic semiconductor factories than anyplace outside Silicon
Valley and many equipment makers and suppliers. Some of the biggest
exhibitors at Semicon West include Applied Materials Inc., which
does almost all of its manufacturing in Austin, and arch-rival
Tokyo Electron Ltd., which has its domestic headquarters in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Semiconductor makers and their suppliers know that if history is
any indication, the party won't last long. The chip business tends
to be cyclical.
</P>
<P>
   Equipment makers surveyed by SEMI said they expect their
industry to grow by only about 24 percent next year, and less than
13 percent two years from now.
</P>
<P>
   But those predictions haven't put a damper on this year's annual
gathering. Many regular Semicon exhibitors said they're getting
more inquiries than in past years. And throughout the 2,800-booth
exhibit halls, talk has been about the industry's recent rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``In (1998) it was all doom and gloom, `` said Art Williams of
Air Systems Inc. a San Jose, Calif., contractor that supplies big
pipes and other heavy-duty gear to semiconductor companies.
``Today, everything's just red hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Randy Cordes, whose Minnesota company, Dynetic Systems,
sells electric motors to equipment companies, ``Everybody is giddy,
just giddy.''
</P>
<P>
   With all the good news, semiconductor equipment makers and
suppliers are engaging in a little dot-com-style partying of their
own.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, at a party celebrating 30 years of SEMI, featured
entertainers include on-the-edge funnyman Dana Carvey and hip
retro-swing group the Cherry Poppin' Daddies.

   THURMONT, Md. _ Midday traffic slips easily down Main Street
outside Tommy's Tavern, where Bob Fleagle leans against the
horseshoe-shaped bar and sips a cold Pabst Blue-Ribbon straight
from the can.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes' drive away, up the winding road into the forested
mountains where Fleagle and his pals have been catching small-mouth
bass and hunting wild mushrooms since they were boys, President
Clinton is huddling with Israeli and Palestinian leaders in hopes
of bringing peace to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope it's workable,'' proffers Fleagle, 50, taking a
break from his carpentry work at the tiny zoo down the road. ``Any
time countries are fighting like that, there's no good can come out
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nestled into the verdant bosom of the Catoctin Mountains, in the
shadow of the Camp David presidential retreat, tiny Thurmont
(population: 4,400), has become the focal point for global efforts
to end a half-century of conflict between Israelis and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Folks like Fleagle can remember the Israeli-Egyptian peace talks
at nearby Camp David in 1978. More than two decades later, many
here believe the time for peace has come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just hoping and hoping that they wind up working something
out for those people over there,'' said Holly Bailey, owner of a
florist shop in town. ``It's a shame they've got to be over there
fighting and everything. It's just really sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Settled nearly three centuries ago by a handful of pioneer
families fleeing religious persecution in their native Germany,
Thurmont is no stranger to intractable conflict.
</P>
<P>
   It sits right between two major Civil War battles: Gettysburg,
15 miles to the North; and roughly the same distance to the South,
the spot on the Monocacy River where a Union artillery battery held
off Confederate soldiers trying to attack Washington, 70 miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   Culturally, though, Thurmont _ the name comes from a German word
that means ``gateway to the mountains'' _ is worlds away from
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A place where the local fireman's carnival still provides a set
piece to a summer of crab cakes, ham sandwiches and fresh tomatoes,
Thurmont knows the term ``Rose Garden,'' not as a White House stage
but rather as the home of Jim and Mary Eyler.
</P>
<P>
   For 44 years, the Eylers have raised roses _ more than 300
plants, including the shoulder-high row that fences off their lawn
from pedestrians and youngsters on bikes _ at their two-story home
at the corner of Main and Carroll streets.
</P>
<P>
   Descendants of the town's frontier settlers, the Eylers _ both,
82 _ sat Tuesday at a kitchen table dominated by a lazy susan
crammed with more than two dozen bottles of prescription drugs, and
shook their heads at the prospects for Mideast peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since time began somewhere over there there's been
fighting, there's been war,'' said Mary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Clinton pulls this off, it'll surprise me,'' she said. ``He
won't.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Breezes from the north will bring dry air to the Northeast and
northern Middle Atlantic states as high pressure builds toward the
region. After a cool start, abundant sun will boost readings to
near seasonal levels. Farther south, scattered showers and
thunderstorms will surround a front draped from North Carolina to
Tennessee. A few of the storms will produce heavy rain, which will
cause flooding. The remainder of the Southeast will be partly
cloudy and hot with spotty afternoon thundershowers.
</P>
<P>
   Hot weather will continue from the Plains to the eastern Rockies
on Wednesday. The heat will be tempered in eastern Colorado and
western Kansas, however, where scattered afternoon thunderstorms
will erupt.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific states will stay dry with ample sun, though patchy
clouds will shroud the immediate coastline.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: HEAT WAVE
</P>
<P>
   A summer heat wave is gripping parts of the Plains and eastern
Rockies. In Denver, the temperature has exceeded 90 degrees every
day since June 29, including a 101-degree reading on July 6th.
Meanwhile, the mercury in Topeka, Kan., reached 100 on Monday, with
temperatures of 90 degrees or higher attained on the previous 10
days. While this region has been hot, there have been much hotter
periods. During the Dust Bowl, the temperature met or exceeded 90
in Topeka for 29 straight days in July of 1937 and 1939, while a
17-day stretch of 100-degree heat occurred in 1936.

 &HT;    'I'm sorry sir, this not your PT Cruiser'
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - When Frances Buchanan faced throat
surgery for suspected cancer last winter, her husband, Glenn, made
her a promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to come through this surgery, and when you do,
we're buying you a new car, any car you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Which struck the mother of five as odd since she was fine with
old cars and it was her husband who was the car buff. ``Oh,
really?'' she asked her husband, dryly. ``And just what car do I
want, and what color do I prefer?''
</P>
<P>
   To which Glenn readily informed her that she craved a
silver-gray PT Cruiser, Chrysler's concept car that looks like a
coupe of the '30s morphed into a panel delivery truck of the same
era. And his wife was OK with that. Really.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always said that if Detroit would make an old-looking car
with modern technology, we'd buy it,'' said Frances, who came
through her surgery in fine shape, with no signs of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out thousands of other retro buffs felt the same way.
Chrysler dealers can't keep the cars _ priced from $16,000 to
$21,000 _ in stock. So brisk is the demand for the jaunty little
Cruisers that folks who have purchased them for list price have
been able to drive them off the lot and sell them for thousands
more.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler dealers put a stop to that practice in a hurry by
making darned sure that if anybody was going to realize windfall
profits, it would be the dealers. This they accomplished by raising
the price until they heard actual screaming, and then jacking it
some more until they heard the softer sound of people putting away
their check books and shuffling dejectedly from showrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The Buchanans knew all about Additional Dealer Profit (ADP) and
made sure they didn't have to pay it by ordering their car months
before they showed up at the dealerships. Accordingly, they
contracted with Palm Beach Auto Mall in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got everything,'' beamed Glenn. ``Leather, moon roof, the
works; $19,970. About all we didn't ask for was the chrome wheels
and a roof rack.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my sons surfs,'' explains Frances, ``and I did not want
to see my car turned into a surfing wagon.''
</P>
<P>
   The choice of silver gray seemed appropriate for their stage in
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both have our share of silver in our hair,'' laughs
Frances, ``and Glenn was wondering if we shouldn't paint a cartoon
bunny on the hood and name it The Gray Hare.''
</P>
<P>
   Great fun. And a great price by ordering before the cars were in
showrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks went by.
</P>
<P>
   And for weeks Glenn would stop by the showroom and ask when he
could expect delivery of his $19,970 silver-gray Chrysler PT
Cruiser with leather seats and moon roof and no roof rack.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in April, a Chrysler PT Cruiser, Limited Edition, just
like the one the Buchanans ordered, came in. The dealer called and
told them it wasn't their car but invited them to come in and smell
the leather.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said I would have to wait for Frances' car, but that I
could have this one for $2,400 over my contract price,'' said
Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `That's OK, I'm very patient. I'll wait.'''
</P>
<P>
   After waiting some more, a salesman confided to Glenn during one
of his visits that the Cruisers were selling $6,000 to $9,000 over
list price and that he would be smart to snap up the floor model.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I told him that I was being patient and that there was a
Cruiser with my name on it for $19,990, he said there was no
telling how long I'd have to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn mulled the matter over another few days and voiced a
suspicion to his wife: ``Momma, I think that's your car.''
</P>
<P>
   And if it wasn't, and nobody else had ordered a car that
happened to be just like the one they wanted, why couldn't they buy
it for the agreed price?
</P>
<P>
   So Glenn went back, sought out the manager and explained that if
the silver-gray PT Cruiser in the showroom was not his car, it was
enough like it, and why not close the deal on the spot? The manager
patiently explained that no, the car in question wasn't his, but
since he had been patient, and there was no telling how long it
would be before his car would be delivered, they would go ahead and
sell it to him.
</P>
<P>
   For only $1,500 more than the Buchanans had contracted to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn caved. And just to show extra good will, the Auto Mall
threw in a special PT Cruiser picnic basket. ``I like to show
everybody my $1,500 picnic basket,'' Glenn said.
</P>
<P>
   The car has been a spectacular success in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three of our five kids live on our street with five of our
grandchildren,'' Frances said. ``The grandchildren are always
coming over and saying, `Mimi, can we go to the store in your
car?'''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn says a trip down Interstate 95 is always good for the
thumbs-up from assorted Mustang and BMW pilots. On Worth Avenue,
where Jags and Rolls don't get a second glance, folks gather around
with questions. The Cruiser, they are told, has a 150 horsepower,
four-cylinder engine that gets 23 mpg city, and the seats roll out
to make room to carry a small sofa.
</P>
<P>
   Their happiness, I regret to say, is not complete. Frances wants
$1,500 back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went back to the sales manager and insisted that that was
our car that they sold us, and that we should get the $1,500 back
and we'd return the picnic basket.''
</P>
<P>
   And the dealers' response?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, they were very nice at first. They explained that it
wasn't our car and that they had bent over backward to please us,
and that I didn't understand market realities and that for example,
I couldn't expect to get into a popular restaurant without
reservations without paying the head waiter something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said that I had my reservation by ordering the car in
February. They said my reservation was for another car, not the one
we bought. I said, `Very well, we paid the extra $1,500 for the car
that you say was not ours. I still have a contract for a loaded
Chrysler PT Cruiser Limited Edition for $19,990 and call me when it
comes in, because I'll buy it.'''
</P>
<P>
   This declaration, according to Frances, troubled the manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that it seemed to him that I was out to hurt the
dealership and that he wished he understood what I had against
them.''
</P>
<P>
   I called Palm Beach Auto Mall and was assured by a spokesman,
who asked not to be named, that the car the Buchaaler just say,
``OK, this isn't your car, but it's just like it, so we'll close
the deal at the list price and make the big bucks on your car when
it comes in''?
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said it doesn't work that way:
</P>
<P>
   ``How could we know what the market would be when their car came
in? All I can tell you is that the Buchanans took 45 minutes to
decide, were fine with the price when they left, and that we threw
in a picnic basket and a mouse pad. When Mrs. Buchanan came back
some time later and asked for $1,500 back, it just re

 &HT;    PT Cruiser very popular and just as pricey
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - When it comes to buying a Chrysler PT
Cruiser, a snoozer is a loser.
</P>
<P>
   The Cruiser is hot. Not as in hot rod, which it looks like, nor
as in stolen, which it might be in the unlikely event that you took
your eyes off it for more than a second. No, the PT (for ``personal
transportation'') Cruiser is Pokemon hot. Tickle-Me-Elmo hot.
Cabbage Patch Kids hot.
</P>
<P>
   For those with a more mature frame of reference, it is Mustang
hot. It's been that long (36 years, if you really must count) since
any mass-produced American car rolled into the showrooms as a
gotta-have-one-right-now cultural phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The Cruiser was back-ordered even before its debut as a 2001
model in April after two years of peekaboo previews at car shows
and on magazine covers. The assembly plant in Mexico didn't reach
full steam until late June, but by then it was clear that the
plant's annual 180,000-car output wouldn't come close to demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The orders are coming in faster than we can make them,'' says
DaimlerChrysler spokesman Ann Smith. A second plant is now being
prepared in Austria to supply Europe and other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Who'd expect this much excitement about something that would
have looked old when the Mustang was new?
</P>
<P>
   Everyone who looks at the PT Cruiser sees something different.
From the rear, some see dad's old station wagon. Others look at the
tall roof and see a London taxi. To many, the Cruiser's bulbous
fenders and angled snout hint at the old, souped-up Fords of James
Dean movies and ZZ Top videos.
</P>
<P>
   Yvonne Mason felt a twinge of recognition when she first saw a
picture of a PT Cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like my first car, a '38 or '39 Plymouth,'' she
says. Her parents bought it for $150 when she learned to drive in
the mid-1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, she saw a Cruiser drive by and felt an emotional
tug. Mason, a widow who works at home in Royal Palm Beach as a
bookkeeper for a roofing company, drove to the Chrysler showroom at
the Palm Beach Auto Mall in West Palm Beach only to discover that
neither she nor anyone else could buy one because there were none
in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not taking orders,'' says general manager Vern Mathis.
</P>
<P>
   What they're taking are names. Dozens of them.
</P>
<P>
   When a PT Cruiser arrives from the factory, it's an event akin
to Mel Gibson stopping by the local movie house to take in a
matinee. Salesmen rush to the phones while everyone else rushes out
to ogle the car. It is no time for anyone on the waiting list to be
having a long-distance chat with Aunt Zelda.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one who gets here first gets the car,'' says salesman
Steve Lee.
</P>
<P>
   When a delivery trailer pulled in with a new Cruiser recently,
Lee was the first salesman to connect with a live prospect: Mason.
She hopped in her Mercury Grand Marquis and got to the showroom in
a flash. She had the dazed look of someone who just won the
lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so shocked they called me,'' she says. ``He had 32 or 33
names on his list.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason kept herself at the head of the line by sitting right down
at Lee's desk to sign a sales contract while her car was being
washed.
</P>
<P>
   She bought her Cruiser without driving it. Without sitting in
it. Without even seeing it.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, without haggling. ``The price _ oh!'' she says,
rolling her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Like others in the thrall of Cruisermania, Mason learned that
the price sticker might as well have been printed in Farsi. She
paid ``just about'' $30,000 for a top-of-the-line PT Cruiser
Limited with Deep Cranberry Pearl Coat paint, taupe-and-beige
leather interior _ and a manufacturer's suggested retail price of
$20,705.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think you'll never pay that much over sticker for any car,
because you already did: The federal government paid a New York
dealer about $10,000 over list price for each of two PT Cruisers
that it plans to crash test. The National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration insists on buying cars directly from dealers to
ensure that manufacturers don't make modifications that could
affect test results.
</P>
<P>
   The deal embarrassed DaimlerChrysler Corp., which says it
discourages dealers from charging more than the list price but has
no way to stop them. It also touched off a minor storm in Congress
and left some wondering if PT really stood for Barnum. But the
government's purchase price wasn't out of line with what Mason and
other buyers across the country are paying.
</P>
<P>
   ``People bash us,'' says Mathis, the Auto Mall's Chrysler
manager. But until the factory ships his dealership more than the
current six-to-eight cars a month, PT Cruisers will remain the
stone crabs of the auto world: strictly market price.
</P>
<P>
   One precedent was parked front-and-center in the Auto Mall
showroom, a two-seat, '30s-style roadster called the Plymouth
Prowler. This one, in blinding yellow paint, carried a factory
sticker price of $43,725 and a hand-lettered dealer sign that read
$68,775 ``current market value.''
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead and offer less. Mathis says the fast-but-cramped
Prowlers are ``sometimes hot, sometimes not.'' DaimlerChrysler has
sold just over 1,600 of them this calendar year, and they may
disappear all together this fall, along with the Plymouth brand
name. But the publicity splash the Prowler created when it went on
sale three years ago and the cult status it's earned since helped
persuade DaimlerChrysler to consider a lower-priced, higher-volume
retromobile.
</P>
<P>
   The idea has caught hold with other manufacturers. Volkswagen
boosted sales by reviving the Beetle, at least in appearance. Ford
is planning to sell a modern version of the 1955 two-seat
Thunderbird, probably listing at $35,000-plus. Chevrolet says it's
going to produce a 1940s-style pickup with a retractable roof.
</P>
<P>
   None is expected to approach the Cruiser's sales level.
DaimlerChrysler says nostalgia isn't the Cruiser's main appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The designer was going after that romantic look _ a really
emotional car,'' Smith says. ``Young people look at it and think
it's totally new.''
</P>
<P>
   Why wouldn't they? Anyone who came of driving age in the 1980s
or '90s would think a car should look like a half-melted bar of
soap, or the box it came in. The last Chrysler to turn so many
heads was the high-finned, gas-guzzling 1957 model.
</P>
<P>
   The Cruiser is even drawing notice from auto enthusiasts, who
normally favor Japanese and European sports models. Doug Kott,
executive editor of ``Road &AMP; Track'' magazine, says he was certain
of the Cruiser's appeal when he drove the magazine's early test
model to a California race shop filled with young mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It absolutely emptied the place,'' he says. ``There is
incredible interest from 25-year-olds. They all came out to
surround it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kott notes the Cruiser's ``whimsical touches, a lot of neat
things,'' many of them picked up from old-time cars: A cue-ball
shift knob on stick shifts; body-color trim on the Limited's
dashboard; a highly stylized Chrysler logo that looks like
something from the classic era.
</P>
<P>
   The Cruiser's distinctions may not go much deeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the PT Cruiser is just a cleverly disguised minivan,''
Kott says. The federal government actually classifies the Cruiser
as a light truck. It has lots of space and practical features like
storage bins and fold-down seats, but it also shares plenty of
parts with the company's economy cars, including a four-cylinder
engine.
</P>
<P>
   None of that seems to discourage the hot-rod and custom-car
crowd from embracing the Cruiser. ``People are already putting
flames on them,'' Smith says. There's even a PT Cruiser Club ($39
to join, but you don't have to buy the car) with a Web site
(www.ptcruiserclub.org) and plans for a national Cruiser cruise to
Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   No one can be sure whether the Cruiser's lure will hold up as
its shape becomes more familiar, but its success so far bodes well
for a new era of distinctive automotive styling, Kott says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cars across the board have become so reliable that it's much
less of a factor in making a purchasing decision,'' Kott says.
``That's where high style comes to the fore. The manufacturer that
can style something appealing will have the edge.''

BUSH OFFERS CHANGES TO FOSTER-CARE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROYAL OAK, Mich. _ As he travels around the country campaigning
for president, Texas Governor George W. Bush often entreats his
audiences to ``love the children'' and calls for a compassionate
society that will ``leave no child behind.''
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday was no different for Bush, as he traveled to
Michigan. There, surrounded by young, black children, he proposed
changes to the nation's foster care system designed to expedite
adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important job in the world is to be a loving parent,
a responsible mother or responsible dad,'' Bush said during a stop
at the Judson Center, a social service agency that was founded at
the turn of the last century as a Baptist children's home.
</P>
<P>
   As a campaign theme, it's hard to find fault with. Unless, of
course, you are Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   On this score, as on others, Gore campaign officials have been
trying to undercut Bush by pointing to his record in Texas, where,
they say, a great many children have been left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush has been making a lot of promises since he began
running for president,'' said Douglas Hattaway, a Gore spokesman.
``But people will look beyond the rhetoric and see a shameful
record of neglect for children's needs in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a study by the Children's Rights Council, an
advocacy group in Washington, Texas was ranked 29th nationwide in
quality as a place to raise a child in 1995. Four years later, the
state had plummeted to 48th place, based on the number of children
in poverty and mothers not receiving prenatal care. In Texas, 25
percent of all children are not covered by health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to further undercut Bush's message of concern,
Democratic National Committee staff members stood outside the
Judson Center and distributed a videotape that they said
illustrated the living conditions of the poor in Texas. Detroit
Mayor Dennis Archer later held a news conference to condemn Bush's
record on poverty and children.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush campaign insists that the candidate's focus on the
needs of children is sincere and that the cause itself should be
uncontroversial. Foster care and adoption, Bush aides note, have
been longtime causes for the governor: Between 1996 and 1999, the
number of children legally available for adoption in Texas more
than doubled. And the time children spent waiting for adoption
while in foster care has been cut in half over the last decade,
aides said. Altogether, adoptions increased 175 percent in the Lone
Star State between 1996 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Bush also proposed spending $2.3 billion over five
years to either help keep children in their homes, or to more
quickly terminate parental rights in order to free children up for
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   He would:
</P>
<P>
   --Require states to conduct criminal background checks on
prospective foster and adoptive parents. Today, states can opt out
of the checks and are only allowed to search records from the
previous five years. Bush would require complete searches.
</P>
<P>
   --Provide $1 billion over five years to increase the adoption
tax credit from $5,000 a year to $7,500 a year to help families
with expenses linked to adoption.
</P>
<P>
   --Give vouchers worth $300 million over five years to thousands
of children who ``age out'' of foster care, but need help paying
for vocational training or education.
</P>
<P>
   --Send $1 billion to states over five years for preventive
services to keep children in their homes or return them to their
homes when possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue I've taken on as the governor of Texas,''
Bush said. ``We Texans tend to exaggerate, but it's safe to say
we're on the cutting edge of this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign countered that it was the Democratic
administration that instituted the $5,000 tax credit for adoptive
parents. And Hattaway, Gore's spokesman, pointed out that
nationally there has been a 30 percent increase in the number of
adoptions out of foster care. According to a White House commission
on adoption, the numbers have risen from 28,000 adoptions in 1996
to 36,000 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Hattaway said the Clinton administration provided the first
financial incentives for states to increase adoptions from foster
care. Last year, the federal government sent $20 million in bonuses
to 35 states that increased their rate of adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Goldsmith, the former mayor of Indianapolis and domestic
policy adviser to Bush, acknowledged some improvements at the
federal level, but said the child welfare system remains ``very
badly broken'' and ``cumbersome, bureaucratic and insensitive.''
Criticisms by the Gore campaign, he said, were gratuitous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we have a policy announcement, they come back to
complaining about health statistics in Texas,'' Goldsmith said.

THIS CLASSOOM DRAMA NEEDS A LONG RECESS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Some shows make their points with subtlety. Others, which have
only a short summer run in which to leave a legacy, use
sledgehammers. And then there's ``Young Americans,'' another
beautiful-white-kids drama from The WB, which actually makes
sledgehammers seem subtle.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of principal character Will Krudski (Rodney
Scott). He's the poor kid from the other side of town, son of an
abusive father, smart enough to get a scholarship to the
hoity-toity prep school through which generations of rich young men
have passed on their way to fame and even more fortune. With a name
like Krudski, it doesn't take a meeting of Mensa to know that Will
is the designated Downtrodden Man.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't come from money or influence. He's not even sure he
belongs at Rawley Academy with guys named Scout Calhoun (Mark
Famiglietti) and Hamilton Fleming (Ian Somerhalder). But his test
scores got him in, and he's determined to stay, even after
divulging to a guy he barely knows the sort of secret that most
people would take with them to the grave. The indiscretion almost
costs him his scholarship, but we all know that's not going to
happen because there are seven more episodes to go after tonight's
premiere.
</P>
<P>
   One of Will's friends from town is Bella Banks (Kate Bosworth),
your basic stunning beauty who works at her dad's gas station.
Bella has the hots for Will's roommate, Scout, but her dad puts the
kibosh on the romance for reasons you'd expect to see on ``All My
Children.''
</P>
<P>
   Also matriculating this summer session is Jake Pratt (Katherine
Moennig), a motorcycle-riding rebel who bounces from prep school to
prep school with his own bizarre secret. (Since a guy named Jake is
played by a woman named Katherine, you can probably guess what it
is.) Jake's friendship with the loner Hamilton and _ oops! _
another indiscretion soon have Hamilton wondering aloud about his
sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The authority figure in this cross between ``I've Got a Secret''
and ``The Facts of Life'' is Mr. Finn (Ed Quinn): teacher, crew
coach and the guy who's supposed to inspire the kids to shoot for
the stars.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the producers didn't aim quite so high, taking a tired
concept and giving it an uninspired treatment. In tonight's
episode, the only sparkle comes from Bosworth, who seems to be
aware that ``Young Americans'' might work better as spoof than as
semiserious drama.
</P>

DISTURBING LOOKS AT THE SPREAD OF HATRED ON THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a free country. But two upcoming cable specials may leave
viewers wondering if too much freedom is a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   HBO's ``HATE.COM: Extremists on the Internet'' and Discovery
Channel's ``Warnings from a Small Town'' both look at hate crimes
and at how ``hate sites'' on the Internet are preying on
impressionable young people with low self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   According to ``HATE.COM,'' many acts of domestic terrorism, such
as the Oklahoma City bombing and the attack at a Jewish community
day-care center in Los Angeles, are not the work of ``lone wolves''
but of soldiers in a loosely organized army whose marching orders
come via neo-Nazi, white-supremacist and homophobic Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Dees, co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center and a
crusader against intolerance, says the answer is not to censor the
Internet. So-called Internet ``filters'' that remove hateful
language are often misguided, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think those filter systems are worth very much because
if you eliminate the word `Nazi' you might eliminate a major piece
of history,'' Dees said. ``You might eliminate things that would be
positive responses to hate on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best filter,'' he continued, ``is an educated public.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Stroud, a former skinhead who learned to hate as a
teenager in Seattle, couldn't agree more. Before he was taken in by
a loving foster family, Stroud says hating other people, especially
others different from him, made him feel superior.
</P>
<P>
   Now a community activist in Portland, Stroud tries to reach
other skinheads by conducting interventions. One such exercise with
a boy named Josh is described in ``Warnings from a Small Town,''
the third installment in Discovery's series, ``Hate &AMP; Violence: No
Simple Answers.'' With information from the Internet, Josh created
a model of a concentration camp for a school project and received
an A from his teacher. He showed how whites belong ``on top'' and
all other races belong ``under the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Stroud says kids like Josh often feel that adults have let them
down, through divorce, abuse, etc.
</P>
<P>
   ``The youth are looking for something,'' Stroud said. ``The kids
are actually looking to this electronic medium for answers they
can't get from adults.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Warnings from a Small Town'' airs Aug. 30 on Discovery. ``HATE
</P>
<P>
   .COM'' is scheduled to premiere Oct. 23 on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   On her most recent shuttle trip last May, U.S. astronaut Mary
Ellen Weber and her crew mates visited the International Space
Station to replace three fire extinguishers, four fans and 10 smoke
detectors because the warranties had expired.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder Americans don't get jazzed about space
exploration anymore?
</P>
<P>
   But Weber says she's OK with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same way that air travel is not quite the same event that
it was when the Wright brothers flew an airplane, ... that's the
era we're moving into with space,'' says Weber, who has flown on
two shuttle missions and logged more than 450 hours in Earth orbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not necessarily about trying to get to one particular
place and all cheer afterwards,'' she says. ``We're trying to take
space and adopt it into our lives, to improve our lives, so I'm not
upset at all that there isn't the same amount of excitement. It
just means we've moved on to a much greater level.''
</P>
<P>
   Make that split level, as in ``contemporary, high-tech home on
spacious lot with spectacular views.'' That's what the
International Space Station will be when construction is completed,
probably in 2005. And even if Weber can forgive America's lack of
enthusiasm for space exploration, the Discovery Channel can't.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 10, Discovery will air ``Inside the Space Station,'' an
hourlong look at probably the greatest engineering marvel of our
time. It will be the first of four quarterly specials dedicated to
the final frontier. Subsequent programs will look at other moons in
our solar system, violent weather on other planets, and comets,
asteroids and meteors.

GORE BLAMES BUSH FOR LACK OF PATIENTS ' BILL OF RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ Continuing his attack on the Republican
Party leadership, Vice President Al Gore Tuesday wagged an accusing
finger at opponent George W. Bush, holding the Texas governor
accountable for Congress's failure to pass a Patients' Bill of
Rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he is willing to pick up the phone and call the leadership
of Congress, he can help us pry loose that one last Republican
vote'' to approve the legislation, Gore told doctors, nurses and
health care professionals at the University of Arkansas for Medical
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for George Bush to show whose side he is on,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
   With the Senate having come as close as one vote to passing the
Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights, Bush, as the ``titular head''
of the Republican Party, can make it happen, Gore said in an
earlier appearance on NBC's ``Today'' show in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Dan Bartlett countered that Gore was
refusing to take responsibility for ``his own failure to provide
leadership in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore listened to several stories from doctors here about cases
where patients didn't get the care the doctors thought was needed
because the health maintenance organization or insurance company
refused to cover it. Gore was clearly familiar with the details of
the stories he heard from the physicians.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, breast cancer surgeon Denise Greenwood recounted, a
low-income patient had her entire breast removed, instead of just a
localized mass, because her insurance company wouldn't pay for the
test needed to determine how far the cancer had spread.
</P>
<P>
   Without that knowledge, Greenwood said, she was forced to remove
the breast _ only to find out later that the cancer was, in fact,
localized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had I been able to confirm to the woman that she had a
localized disease, she would have her breast today,'' Greenwood
said.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would give patients and doctors greater ability
to challenge decisions made by their HMOs. Republicans on Capitol
Hill have backed a less sweeping bill, which Gore called ``phony.''
The Republican bill would not protect people from financial penalty
for using emergency care services, Gore said, and it would not
guarantee patients access to specialized care.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not a patients' bill of rights,'' Gore said. ``It is a
blank check for the insurance industry to keep on doing what's
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The HMO horror stories go to a theme Gore has been pushing for
the past few weeks, painting himself as a populist fighting the
``special interests'' he says are bankrolling the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's campaign has been almost clinical in its
effort to get out that message, moving from an attack on
pharmaceutical companies to a denouncement of the oil industry to
the recurring theme of HMO administrators concerned more about
finances than first-rate patient care.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely does the meticulously scheduled Gore campaign lapse into
the unplanned. That protects Gore from unhappy surprises, but also
leaves him vulnerable to an image as stiff and scripted.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's campaign staff was clearly pleased Tuesday
at a spontaneous Gore moment, when the vice president presented
muffins to no-nonsense TV jurist Judge Judy.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, whose full name is Judy Sheindlin, appeared after
Gore on ``Today'' Tuesday morning and complained to host Matt Lauer
that she didn't get her breakfast muffins because Gore had ``taken
over the Green Room,'' the waiting area for TV guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's ever taken over the Green Room before,'' bellowed
Sheindlin, who was promoting her new book, ``Keep It Simple,
Stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the vice president ought to get me a muffin,''
Sheindlin insisted, her words blaring through a loudspeaker to the
street outside the studio, where Gore was shaking hands with a
crowd of people. ``I think he ought to get me a dozen muffins if he
wants my vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore went back into the studio, had a staffer retrieve a tray of
muffins from the Green Room, and approached the set, behind the
still-complaining Sheindlin.
</P>
<P>
   Lauer noted to Sheindlin that her words carried a lot of power.
As if on cue, Gore then strode in front of the cantankerous judge,
bent down on one knee, and offered her the muffins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does he have your vote?'' Lauer asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to talk about that later,'' Sheindlin
said.

`PULL MY DAISY': JACK KEROUAC   AND THE BEATS,   OFF THE ROAD   AND
IN A FILM 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``A splendid entertainment for the entire family _ no
sex, no violence'' was how Alfred Leslie archly plugged his new
film ``Pull My Daisy'' in Variety in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then I quoted a line of Jack's: `Doing something and
saying goodbye and saying goodbye and doing something are both the
same,''' he said. ``Which means, I think, living a life is enough
to be able to get through life, and you don't always have to be
enormously active or a great star.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jack in question is Jack Kerouac. That many of the Beats
went on to achieve a potent stardom is almost beside the point.
From its inception, Beat lent itself to myriad interpretations, but
to people like Kerouac, it derived mostly from ``beatific.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday at 10 p.m., Channel 13/WNET will present ``Pull My
Daisy,'' a slice _ more a sliver _ of a day in the lives of the
Beats. In its television debut, the film leads a program of five
shorts that reflect the Beat philosophy, part of the channel's
independent film series ``Reel New York.''
</P>
<P>
   A sort of wry social commentary, the film is at once about
nothing and everything. There is no plot, no story, no action or
drama. Photographed in grainy black and white, a band of urban
troubadours enter a loft on the Lower East Side and wreak merry
havoc on the lives within. Slouching on a sofa, flasks in hand, the
men spout poetry and ponder spirituality, their voices sounding
oddly the same, their mouths not quite in sync with the vocal
track, which scats along to a loose, bluesy beat. Allen Ginsberg,
Gregory Corso and Larry Rivers are doing what they did best:
hanging out, kicking back, taking it all in. As the narrator, a
coolly ebullient Kerouac makes his words their own.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Leslie and the photographer Robert Frank, the film
was based on an act from Kerouac's unproduced play ``The Beat
Generation'' and named for a poem by Ginsberg and Kerouac. The
play, in turn, was inspired by an incident in the lives of Neal
Cassady, Kerouac's partner on the road, and Cassady's wife,
Carolyn, who aspired to suburban respectability in Northern
California.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie, now 74, envisioned the project as part of a trilogy, but
almost immediately ran into a stumbling block in Kerouac's syntax.
``When I read his text and thought of the actors speaking the
lines, I thought it was insane,'' he said. ``It didn't sound right.
I decided against shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Only after hearing Kerouac read the script himself did a concept
take shape. ``What troubled me,'' Leslie said, ``was that there
were no characters in Jack's work. All of Jack Kerouac is written
as a monologuist taking everybody's part.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was decided: Kerouac would do all the speaking for
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the film in a sound studio, Kerouac dubbed its
narration as David Amram, the composer and musician who would later
write the score for ``The Manchurian Candidate,'' sat in a booth
and played the piano.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite 30 minutes long, ``Pull My Daisy'' opened at the
Cinema 16 Film Society in Manhattan as an ``outrageous success,
though it made no money and was marginalized immediately,'' Leslie
said. After winning first prize at the San Francisco Film Festival,
it quickly lost momentum.
</P>
<P>
   He stored the film in his West 22nd Street studio, but lost it
to a 1966 inferno that killed 12 firefighters. But some scraps were
found in the rubble, and he kept them in a refrigerator until a
grant in 1990 enabled him to restore the work. A release print had
been discovered in the meantime and was presented to the Museum of
Modern Art. In 1997, the Library of Congress installed ``Pull My
Daisy'' into its film archive for safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   ```Pull My Daisy' in 1959 looked like an insane work to
people,'' Leslie said. ``It looked chaotic and unstructured, and
people didn't know how to deal with it. But the film had a very,
very wide influence because it opened up a way for people to think
of being more independent in their vision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a formal film, quiet in tone and movement,'' he
continued. ``It had a strong subtext of subversiveness, a Samuel
Beckett, Chehkovian kind of quality in which nothing happens. Like
a Seinfeld incident of nothing. But I thought in that you could see
the naturalness of all of the lives of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the trappings of the Beats wore thin, especially to
those at the movement's vortex.
</P>
<P>
   ```Pull My Daisy' came about largely from a group of painters
and writers who wanted to make a movie to show their children and
grandchildren what we were really like,'' said Amram, 69, who also
appeared in the film. ``The image of a beatnik had become so
horrific that it was something we couldn't identify with anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``In `Pull My Daisy,' nobody looks like a beatnik,'' he said of
the cliched turtlenecks, berets and goatees that Kerouac likened to
a Roman Catholic school dress code, and the movement's subtext of
drugs and malaise. ``We all shared a joy of life, the ability to
work hard at what we were trying to do artistically, at having fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film is so lighthearted and joyous and funny, it's the
antidote to the Beat label,'' he added. ``That was the albatross
around all our necks.''

GREENSPAN DELIVERS CAUTIOUSLY UPBEAT MESSAGE ON ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN VAMES   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The so-called new economy -- where gains in the efficiency of
workers allows economic growth above historical trends without
inflation -- does not show any glaring threat of disappearing,
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said in a speech Tuesday.
But until economic growth slows from the stellar pace seen in
recent years, he said, it is unclear whether the new economy trends
will be permanent or fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recent period has been marked by a transformation to an
economy that is more productive as competitive forces become
increasingly intense and new technologies raise the efficiency of
our businesses,'' Greenspan told the National Governors'
Association in a speech.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks were another acknowledgement from the nation's top
central banking official that gains in worker productivity have
allowed the current economic expansion to run longer and stronger
than any in the nation's history. But Greenspan also cautioned that
it is so far unclear what portion of productivity gains are
permanent, and what portion could vanish.
</P>
<P>
   He said certain components of the nation's productivity growth,
such as the ability of computers to more intelligently manage
inventories and production schedules, appear to be permanent. But
other views of productivity growth, he said, suggest that the
strong economy is merely forcing businesses to stretch their
resources further to keep up with demand, a phenomenon that would
reverse if demand were to decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we experience an economic slowdown, we will not know for
sure how much of the extraordinary rise in output per hour in the
past five years is attributable to the irreversible way value is
created and how much reflects endeavors on the part of the business
community to stretch existing capital and labor resources that are
not sustainable over the longer run,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such uncertainty, Greenspan suggested there are some
permanent innovations that will continue to change the face of the
economy. Long-lasting productivity gains, he said, include the
biotechnology revolution and its effect on medicine, and changes in
information technology that have diminished the cycles of bloating
and shrinking inventories, which in the past has proved deadly for
economic expansions.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan also dismissed fears that job creation will slow as
technology allows businesses to get more done with fewer workers.
``Because technological change spawns so many opportunities for
businesses to expand, the introduction of new efficiencies has
today, as in the past, created a vibrant economy in which
opportunities for jobs have blossomed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Greenspan gave no indication of whether Fed
policymakers intend to change U.S. interest rates when they meet
Aug. 22. The Fed has raised short-term interest rates six times in
the past year, influencing financing costs for everything from
credit cards to mortgages, as the central bank attempted to lessen
the risk of inflation by slowing economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   At its most recent meeting June 28, the Fed held interest rates
steady citing ``tentative and preliminary'' signs of an economic
slowdown, such as fewer home sales and retail sales in the second
quarter. But many economists expect that the Fed will continue to
raise rates if economic activity picks up again in the third
quarter.

MANOR CARE MAKES OFFER FOR REST OF IN HOME HEALTH 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN KOO   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Manor Care (HCR:NYSE), one of the largest operators of nursing
homes in the U.S., moved closer to an expansion into the home
health care business Tuesday with an offer to acquire the 38.6
percent of In Home Health (IHHI:Nasdaq) that it does not already
own.
</P>
<P>
   Manor Care has been seeking to acquire all of the Minnetonka,
Minn.-based company for more than a month and now owns about 61.4
percent of its 5.53 million shares. Under the terms of its offer
announced Tuesday, the Toledo, Ohio-based company said it would pay
$3.375 a share, or about $7.2 million, for the rest, a 71 percent
premium over In Home Health's closing price May 31, the day before
Manor Care's intentions were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two weeks, Manor Care has also paid that price for
shares owned by In Home Health's next three largest shareholders:
Heartland Advisors, RS Value Group and Eastbourne Capital
Management. On June 28, Manor Care paid $1.5 million for
Heartland's 454,401 shares of In Home Health. On June 29, Manor
Care paid $1.6 million for RS Value Group's 461,734 shares, as well
as $778,275 for hedge fund Eastbourne's 230,600 shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been a significant shareholder in the company since
1995,'' said Geoffrey Meyers, chief financial officer of Manor
Care, in an interview. ``We want to take a more active role in the
management of this business.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the merger in 1998 between Manor Care and Health Care
and Retirement, Manor Care has not grown through acquisitions. Its
strategy of keeping costs low and concentrating in relatively
affluent areas has helped keep the company financially strong,
unlike many of its highly indebted competitors. Manor care is
considered one of the few good investment plays in the industry.

PINNACLE PLUNGES AFTER EARNINGS WARNING 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIM ARANGO   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares in digital video company Pinnacle Systems (PCLE:Nasdaq)
plunged 59 percent Tuesday after it said that its quarterly
earnings would be significantly lower than analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
   For its fiscal fourth quarter that ended June 30, Pinnacle
announced before the open of trading that it will earn 6 to 8 cents
per share, off 50 percent to 62.5 percent from the 16-cent analyst
consensus, according to research firm First Call/Thomson Financial.
The company earned 13 cents a share in last year's fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Pinnacle shares were lately down 13 3/8 at 9 1/4 after reaching
a 52-week low of 8 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement, the company added that sales for the
fourth quarter are expected to be around $62 million, a 30 percent
increase compared to the same period a year ago. ``Nonetheless,
this was below our expectations for the quarter, impacting our
profitability,'' said Mark Sanders, Pinnacle's president and chief
executive officer. ``The fourth quarter was particularly back-end
loaded and a significant amount of business closed in the last week
on terms less favorable than expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Mountain View, Calif.-based Pinnacle is scheduled to release
earnings July 25.
</P>
<P>
   Pinnacle's announcement is only the latest in a round of
earnings warnings from tech companies.

   Yahoo shows profit, outperforms expectations
</P>
<P>
   By Frances Katz
</P>
<P>
   c. 20000 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Yahoo tossed out the first pitch of the NASDAQ
earnings season Tuesday, announcing a profitable second quarter
that surpassed analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the big four Internet companies, along with America
Online, Amazon and eBay, Yahoo's earnings are generally viewed as a
key indicator of the health of the Internet marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   The top portal on the Web, Yahoo reported higher than expected
earnings and said revenues more than doubled. The company reported
net income of $65.5 million, or 11 cents a share, after breaking
even a year earlier. Revenue more than doubled to $270.1 million,
from $128.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo shares, which have fallen 29 percent in the past three
weeks amid concern about the earnings outlook, rose following
release of the higher-than-expected revenue number. They traded as
high as 114, up 8 percent from a NASDAQ close of 105 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo has attracted more attention than usual this quarter
because of concerns that the recent dot-com fallout will make a
dent in its advertising revenues. Advertising on the Yahoo site
makes up 70 percent of the company's revenue and dot-com marketing
makes up a substantial chunk of its overall advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts from Deutsche Banc recently downgraded Yahoo from a
``strong buy'' to a ``buy'' saying there will probably be less ad
spending from cash-strapped dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   But, while most analyst agree the second quarter may be a gloomy
one for Internet stocks, they say Yahoo is too big to feel much, if
any, of the fallout.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Gristina, an analyst with Atlanta's Robinson Humphrey said
the company is in good shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yahoo's business model is not in jeopardy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is not going away and advertising is still very
effective on the Net, `` he said. ``To me it just says that they
may go into a slower period of growth, but Yahoo is still a
must-have in your portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry average is about 20 per cent of ad revenue
generated by the dot-coms,'' said David Card a senior analyst with
Jupiter Communications. ``Yahoo's percentage might be a little
higher, so there is some risk there.'' However Card says he doesn't
see a slowing down of dot-com advertising happening yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are talking about cutting back, but I haven't seen
anything yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say the real indicator of the state of ad spending
on the Web will come next week when DoubleClick, the online company
that sells and serves advertising to hundreds of Web sites, reports
its earnings Tuesday.

Minister Yitzhak Rabin, some left-wing Israelis vow they will show

1995 helped create the atmosphere for Rabin's death and they don't
want to repeat the mistake. The battle for the grassroots is under

 &HT;    The dynamic duo of Tim McGraw, Faith Hill breathe new life into
the country tradition
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   They probably didn't know it at the time, but superstars Faith
Hill and Tim McGraw resurrected a disappearing piece of Nashville
tradition in Atlanta four years ago with the Kiss.
</P>
<P>
   On a hot July evening in 1996, the two were performing in
Centennial Olympic Park. It was three days before the bombing that
would make the venue notorious throughout the rest of the summer.
The air was heavy with humidity and rumors of a budding romance
between the two stars.
</P>
<P>
   Late into the evening, McGraw stepped into the spotlight and
began singing the sizzling R&AMP;B, Tony Rich hit ``Nobody Knows It but
Me'' _``The nights are lonely, days are so long. ... I'm missing
you, and nobody knows it but me.''
</P>
<P>
   From stage left, Hill appeared, in skintight, black-leather
pants, grabbed a microphone, and began singing back. After three
minutes of heavy flirting, the two dropped their microphones and
laid a kiss on each other that had the Atlanta crowd screaming like
hungry citizens at the Roman Colosseum.
</P>
<P>
   That was the moment the country duet was reborn.
</P>
<P>
   McGraw and Hill went on to dump fiances, get married and have
two children. When they pull into Philips Arena tonight, they are
perhaps the most hyped act in country music, with a string of
individual hits. (Hill's nearly naked romp on satin sheets for her
recent ``Breathe'' video has even made her a pop diva.) But it's
their duets _ often sappy, emotion-soaked tunes about being in luv
_ that now highlight their dance card.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tim and Faith (as they are known by their fans) began
teaming at home and in the studio, the country music duet was on
the endangered list. It had been nearly two decades since the
heyday of the format, when Conway Twitty and Loretta Lynn, Dolly
Parton and Porter Wagoner, and George Jones and Tammy Wynette
defined the style.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's interesting. We really haven't had any duets in
the traditional sense for a long time,'' says Johnny Gray, music
director of Atlanta country station Kicks 101.5. ``It may be
because of all the hat acts of the '90s. It was about the guys as
individuals, Garth (Brooks) and all the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Though other genres of music have had pairings that have made
music history (such as pop's Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell),
country music has always been the petri dish for the style. Perhaps
it's because early Nashville was mostly a man's town, with female
vocalists relegated to the role of ``girl singer.'' Quite often, to
gain any radio airplay or national exposure, a woman had to team
with a man.
</P>
<P>
   Take Dolly Parton. The big-haired, big-chested vocalist could
circle the wagons around Porter when it came to singing, but it was
his access to Nashville's musical power base that landed her a job.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Wynette had marginal success as a solo act on the charts
(``Apartment Number Nine'') before meeting George Jones, yet their
relationship virtually defines the term ``country duet.'' It's
primarily because their music reflected the drama of what was
happening to them in real life.
</P>
<P>
   Married to other people, George and Tammy fell hard for each
other, a tempestuous relationship that was recorded in the tabloids
and in the studio. As they were falling in love, the public heard
the sweet sounds of ``Near You.'' When they finally exchanged vows,
they made the over-the-top duet, ``The Ceremony,'' in which they
recited marriage vows into the microphone. When the hard-drinking
Jones pulled a shotgun on Wynette, producer Billy Sherrill got them
to record the ultimate song of alienation, ``Two Story House.'' As
the two tried to save their marriage in spite of the highly public
troubles, they released ``We're Gonna Hold On.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest country duet team of all time was Conway
Twitty and Loretta Lynn. She had taken the spotlight as one of the
first independent women to make records in Nashville. He was one of
Nashville's hottest hitmakers. According to Lynn, the emotion in
their songs came out of mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what was goin' on was that Conway and me would go into
the studio and try to out-sing each other,'' Lynn says, remembering
her late duet partner. ``He'd bring something in and I would try to
top him.''
</P>
<P>
   Conway and Lynn created a heated magic in the studio that has
yet to be replicated. They took the story line so essential to
country music and gave it a male/female script. ``Darlin', I knew
it was you,'' sings Loretta, as Conway literally growls back into a
telephone receiver, ``Oh, yeah, Loretta, you know it's true.''
(``As Soon As I Hang Up the Phone''). Their ``Louisiana Woman,
Mississippi Man'' has them swimming a river to get to each other.
Then, ``(Nothin's Cold as Ashes) After the Fire Is Gone.''
</P>
<P>
   As women gained autonomy in the Nashville star system, the
male/female duet all but disappeared until McGraw and Hill. From
impassioned videos featuring a very pregnant Hill (``It's Your
Love'') to bubbly singles such as ``The Way You Love Me,'' they
have turned successful individual careers into couple gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Tim and Faith are it, '' says Steve Mitchell, program
director for Y-106.7. ``When you listen to those songs, they are
passionate, the real deal.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that McGraw and Hill have successfully avoided,
however, are the real-life headlines. In today's world of carefully
cultivated public imaging, none of us would know if he stormed out
in the middle of the night, or if she packed the kids in the SUV
and headed out of town. As far as the public is concerned, they are
the perfect couple, perfectly in love.
</P>
<P>
   But music, particularly country duets, has always been about
fantasy.

 &HT;    `Young Americans' are a sight to see
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ah, to be young and American.
</P>
<P>
   To be young and American and stunningly gorgeous and buff of
bod. To strip down with a bunch of other perfect, underwear-clad
teenagers and run through a sun-dappled field in slow-motion to a
sparkling lake, and to plunge into that lake. And to frolic.
</P>
<P>
   To be young and slow-dancing at night; to have a literature
teacher who's incredibly cool and non-conformist and hunky even
though he's (ick!) over 30; to live in soft focus and golden
sunlight and tumble in the grass with a person even more beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   And yet. The boys and girls of ``Young Americans'' _ a new WB
series that makes ``Dawson's Creek'' feel like a Faulkner symposium
_ are not happy. Sun-drenched and shirtless and frolicsome though
they are, they have secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Requirements for admission into Rawley Academy, a New England
prep school where this summer series takes place: good grades, good
looks, lots of money, a terrible secret. Will (Rodney Scott)
cheated to get in. Scout (Mark Famiglietti) can't have his beloved,
Bella (Kate Bosworth), because they discover that they're secret
half-siblings. And Jake? Well, Jake has a certain androgynous air
and is played by an actress named Katherine Moennig, so Jake is the
only person at Rawley who isn't going shirtless all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Bella doesn't go to Rawley _ she works at her dad's garage in
the nearby town. She's supposed to be blue collar, but glows with
the aura of pampered youth, that whole tan-teeth-hair thing that
marks her as the kind of girl who gets a Beemer from daddy on her
16th birthday, not the kind of girl who does brake jobs on Beemers.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, though, she's a swell fit for the boys of Rawley,
all of whom have frolicked right out of a Herb Ritts underwear ad
in Vanity Fair. You don't so much watch ``Young Americans'' as
ogle.
</P>
<P>
   The WB originally announced the show as a midseason replacement
for this past spring, then moved it to the summer, usually not a
show of respect from the network. Parts of the pilot were shot at
Agnes Scott College in Decatur, but don't hold that against an
otherwise fine school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young Americans''
</P>
<P>
   9 tonight on the WB.

SHERRY, THE PERFECT MATE 
</HEADLINE>
  By ERIC ASIMOV   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you scoff at the notion that pairing particular wines and
foods can create magic, here is a suggestion: Get some good
marinated Spanish olives and a bottle of dry fino or manzanilla
sherry. Chill the sherry well, pour a small glass and taste it with
the olives, then see if you don't agree that, like peanut butter
and jelly, the two belong together.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to find a beverage less understood and more
undervalued than sherry. The image of a treacly brown fluid brought
out at academic teas could not be further from the truth. In fact,
top-quality dry sherries are probably the cheapest great wines you
are likely to find.
</P>
<P>
   Authentic sherries come only from an area near the Atlantic
coast in Andalusia in southwestern Spain, bounded by the towns of
Jerez de la Frontera, Cadiz and Sanlucar de Barrameda. Sherry comes
in two types, fino and oloroso. The difference depends on a strain
of yeast called flor, which develops only on finos. It gives finos
a tangy quality and prevents them from oxidizing, so they retain
their freshness and pale color. Olorosos are darker, richer, higher
in alcohol and more expensive because they are aged longer.
</P>
<P>
   Finos are the focus here, and their styles and flavors can vary
tremendously. Those simply labeled fino are light and bone-dry with
complex aromas that can range from almonds to an attractive
petroleum quality. Manzanilla, a type of fino made only in the
seaside town of Sanlucar, is more delicate and often has a salty
quality. Amontillados are finos that have been aged, becoming
darker, softer and nuttier.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all sherries are blends, and so are not vintage wines.
When buying a fino or manzanilla, ask your retailer for the
freshest bottle. Chill it and drink it soon with shellfish, light
fish dishes, even chicken and ham.

FEASTING LETHALLY ON CALIFORNIA'S VINEYARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Texas)   By   FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The big news in the California wine country two years ago was
the victorious conclusion to the 15-year, multi-million-dollar war
against phylloxera, a parasite killer that eventually wiped out
some 50,000 acres of prime California vineyard land.
</P>
<P>
   The diseased vines were uprooted and burned and new ones
planted, at enormous cost. One winemaker, the Robert Mondavi Winery
in the Napa Valley, reported that replanting its vineyards cost $50
million.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-won celebrations may have been premature. By 1997,
another predator had emerged in the state's southernmost vineyards
and began to spread northward with astonishing speed and
frightening results. Called Pierce's disease, it is a bacterium
spread by a tiny flying insect called the glassy-winged
sharpshooter. The insect implants the bacteria in a vine when it
feeds on the stem, and within several weeks, the vine dies.
</P>
<P>
   Several prominent wineries have shut down vineyards or parts of
vineyards because of Pierce's disease, among them Callaway
Vineyards and Winery in Temecula, in Southern California, and Bonny
Doon Vineyard, in the Santa Cruz Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   There is no cure for the disease, which kills vines by
preventing them from absorbing water and nutrients. There is no
effective method to stop this particular sharpshooter, which one
scientist called ``stunningly voracious'' at a meeting of Napa
Valley growers.
</P>
<P>
   Wine and wine grapes are a $33-billion-a-year industry in
California. The state estimates that damage from Pierce's disease
in the last two years was worth $6 million, none of which seems to
have been passed on to the consumer. Yet. But the future is
anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, California grape growers have been contending with
Pierce's disease for more than a century. It was first identified
near Anaheim in 1892, when it wiped out some 40,000 acres of grape
vines over a period of years. For a time it was known as the
Anaheim disease.
</P>
<P>
   A century ago and, in fact, until three years ago, the carrier
was the blue-green sharpshooter, an insect that thrives near rivers
and streams. The disease was usually controlled by replanting and
by moving vines away from streams or ponds.
</P>
<P>
   The glassy-winged sharpshooter is a more dangerous relative:
according to scientists at the University of California at Davis,
this sharpshooter can fly higher and farther than the blue-green
and can consume huge amounts of plant sap a day, the equivalent of
a 150-pound human's drinking 4,300 gallons of liquid. Patrick
Gleason, the director of the American Vineyard Foundation in Napa,
calls it ``the pterodactyl of sharpshooters.''
</P>
<P>
   The glassy-winged sharpshooter is thought to have entered
California a decade ago on ornamental plants shipped from Florida
nurseries. The insect thrives in the country's warmer regions,
which is one reason why European grape varieties like cabernet
sauvignon, merlot and chardonnay have never succeeded in Florida
and other southeastern states. Because of the sharpshooter,
Pierce's disease has also become a serious problem for Texas
vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   Its current resurgence in California has been most pronounced in
the south where, according to the state's Department of Food and
Agriculture, it has been found in San Diego, Riverside, San
Bernardino, Ventura, Orange and Santa Barbara Counties. In
Temecula, in Riverside County, the disease has wiped out nearly one
third of the wine grape vineyards in the 3,000-acre growing area.
</P>
<P>
   Both Napa and Monterey Counties are considering a nursery
certification program for ornamental and other plants purchased
elsewhere. ``We are advocating that all nursery stock from the
infested counties be inspected,'' said Corky Roche, a vineyard
consultant based in Salinas and a member of a state task force
studying Pierce's disease.
</P>
<P>
   The most vulnerable grape vines are chardonnay, which is the
state's most widely planted fine wine variety, and pinot noir,
which has been growing in popularity in recent years. Temecula and
Riverside Counties are particularly vulnerable because they also
have large groves of citrus fruits, and the sharpshooter likes to
lay its eggs in the leaves of citrus trees.
</P>
<P>
   The state's premier wine regions _ Napa, Sonoma and Mendocino
Counties, in Northern California _ have yet to encounter the
glassy-winged sharpshooter. Two weeks ago, the Napa Valley was
officially declared free of the insect by the Department of Food
and Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are worried,'' said Ed Weber, an agricultural agent in Napa
County for the University of California. ``The insect is moving
north _ it's been found in Tulare and Fresno counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pierce's disease is an ongoing problem here in Napa,'' Weber
continued, ``and over the years we've had a lot of losses. But only
with the blue-green insect.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with growers and winemakers in March, Gov. Gray Davis
said he would sponsor legislation to provide $6.9 million in state
funds each year for the next two years and would seek another $7.1
million in federal help to fight Pierce's disease. Last year the
California Assembly appropriated $750,000 a year for three years
for research, contingent on an annual commitment of $250,000 from
the California wine and grape industry.
</P>
<P>
   Weber said that shipments of ornamental plants often presented
serious problems because they often carry the bug's eggs. ``But how
do you inspect all the plants?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   For now, he said, Pierce's disease is primarily being fought by
inspecting imported plants. Officials are trying to destroy the
sharpshooter eggs by spraying citrus trees with insecticides, and a
plan to introduce an insect called the fairy wasp, which destroys
the eggs, into infected areas, is being considered.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the only effective response may be what Callaway
has done: buy grapes elsewhere. George Rose, a spokesman for the
winery, said Callaway was about to introduce a line of wines made
from grapes purchased in the Central Coast area, well north of
Temecula, where these is no Pierce's disease. At least, not yet.

   CHINA-PRIVATE-SECTOR (Jiaxing, China) _ China has been marching
on the road of economic reform for more than two decades now, but
its private sector remains a tiny slice of an economy still
dominated by government-owned organizations. Entrepreneurs are
systematically shunned by China's banks, discriminated against by
regulators and barred from entering many industries. Barriers to
capital formation keep most private businesses from providing more
than a handful of jobs. There is growing pressure to change that.
Allowing the private sector to absorb the state's excess workers is
an obvious way to improve the economy. And there is a more pressing
reason rooted in Chinese nationalism: With World Trade Organization
membership threatening to open the domestic market wider in the
next five years, foreigners could take over a huge part of China's
economy unless it unleashes private entrepreneurs soon. By Craig S.
Smith.

   MIDEAST-TALKS (Thurmont, Md.) _ Ledeall: In the verdant hills of
Maryland, far from the arid land that is the object of their bitter
dispute, the Israeli and Palestinian leaders began their fateful
peace summit at Camp David on Tuesday with the far-reaching, most
think improbable, goal of ending their 52-year-old conflict. On the
first day of an open-ended, secluded meeting, President Clinton
ushered the leaders, Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, into the presidential retreat
where he hopes that the chemistry of the place and the moment can
induce a spirit of ``principled compromise'' that yields a
substantive peace agreement. By Deborah Sontag.

&HT;     SENATE GEARS UP TO END ESTATE TAX; A LOOK AT WHO WOULD GAIN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Senate moves toward repeal of the federal
estate tax, Republicans and Democrats are fighting a public
relations war over who would be helped by the measure. A look at
the numbers shows the answer is: very few.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders, who have gained the support of some
Democrats, argue that the tax prevents owners of family farms and
small businesses from passing along the enterprise to their
children.
</P>
<P>
   But William Gale, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution,
a Washington think tank, says only about 2 percent of the estates
of people who die are large enough to be taxed and that very few of
these estates belong to farmers and small business people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just isn't a tax that impacts your average family, or
even your upper middle class family except in a few rare cases,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   To give perspective, according to Gale and other tax experts,
the numbers for 1997 _ the latest available _ show that:
</P>
<P>
   _ Beneficiaries of fewer than 43,000 estates _ 1.9 percent of
the 2.3 million estates of people who died that year _ had to pay
any federal tax on the proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   _ Of the 43,000 estates taxed, about 5 percent _ or 2,400 _ paid
nearly half of the $28 billion collected in estate tax revenue that
year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only about 1,300 farmers and small-business owners who died
left estates large enough to be taxed, and most of those estates
received special tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tax pretty much falls on the shoulders of a highly
concentrated group of rich families,'' Gale said.
</P>
<P>
   Iris Lav, an economist at the Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities, a Washington-based think tank, said repealing the
estate tax would be a ``windfall'' for the country's wealthiest
families.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she said, the 2,400 estates that paid nearly half
of all estate taxes in 1997 would have saved an average of $3.4
million each if the law had been repealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say repealing the estate tax is about helping farmers and
small business people just doesn't hold water when you look at the
numbers,'' Lav added.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current law, any estate worth more than $675,000 that
is left this year to a person other than an American citizen spouse
is subject to taxes that can run as high as 55 percent on the
amount above $675,000.
</P>
<P>
   However, an estate of any size may be bequeathed to a spouse
free of federal estate tax. The $675,000 figure is scheduled to
rise gradually until it reaches $1 million in 2006.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, each member of a married couple is entitled to the
basic $675,000 exemption. Thus, a couple can effectively exempt
$1.35 million from the estate tax this year, and the amount will go
to $2 million by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the estate and gift tax netted nearly $30 billion _
about 1.5 percent of federal revenue. By comparison, the gasoline
tax raised $39 billion, the individual income tax $879 billion and
the corporate income tax $185 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democratic leaders plan to use the figures to convince
the public that the current law should not be repealed and is
needed to slow the trend toward a concentration of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Ranit Schmelzer, a spokeswoman for Senate minority leader Thomas
Daschle of South Dakota, said in an interview Tuesday, ``Repealing
the estate tax is about helping a tiny number of very wealthy
people. In terms of farmers and small business owner, we're talking
about a very small slice of an already small slice of the overall
population.''
</P>
<P>
   To save the estate tax, the Democratic leadership has offered an
alternative bill that would lower the maximum tax rate from 55
percent to 44 percent and raise the exemption level from the
present $675,000 to $825,000.
</P>
<P>
   Schmelzer added that if the law needs to be changed to help
farmers and small-business owners, ``we would be all for it. But
Sen. Daschle and other Democratic leaders don't believe you need to
scrap the whole tax to help 3 percent of the people who pay it,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Schmelzer added that the estate tax already grants special
treatment, such as extended payment plans and special deductions,
to farmers and small business owners.
</P>
<P>
   But most Republicans _ and a significant number of Democrats _
argue that that the ``death tax,'' as they call it, unfairly
penalizes people for saving their money. It also hurts those
farmers and small business owners who pay large sums to lawyers and
estate planners to ensure they can pass their assets to their
children, the opponents say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a perverse kind of tax,'' said Sen. John Kyl, R-Ariz.,
sponsor of the Senate bill to repeal the law. ``What is the
American dream? It's making sure you're children have a better
life.''
</P>
<P>
   That argument helped House Republicans persuade 65 Democrats to
support repealing the tax, garnering a lopsided 279-to-136 vote
last month. The House majority was enough to override President
Clinton's promised veto of the tax cut. But few believe that the
pro-repeal vote in the Senate, expected late this week, will be as
great.
</P>
<P>
   However, John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott of Mississippi, said support for repeal has grown among
Democrats because the law is ``simply unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Uncle Sam reaches beyond the grave and takes
money away from a grieving family appalls every American,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Czwartacki added that the booming economy and the growing number
of people who own stock has changed the way Americans look at the
estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are beginning to realize that years of working hard
and saving to ensure a better life for their children can be
destroyed by the estate tax,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of taxpayers with annual incomes of $100,000 or more
soared to 8.3 million in 1998, up 15 percent from 7.2 million in
1997, according to the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   During the next 50 years, an estimated $30 trillion is projected
to change hands from one generation to the next in the United
States. This year Americans are expected to inherit close to $150
billion, according to a study by the Boston College Social Welfare
Research Institute.

 &HT;    TENSE NORTHERN IRELAND AWAITS, BRACES FOR POTENTIAL TWELFTH OF
JULY FIREWORKS

   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland _ An estimated 80,000 Protestants
are expected to parade throughout Northern Ireland Wednesday to cap
off a deeply contentious period that has renewed sectarian violence
across the troubled province.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of the July 12 climax of the marching season,
thousands of bonfires were lit Tuesday night across the province,
which with armored cars patrolling neighborhoods has the feel of a
war zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to Beirut,'' said the cook at The Chip Wagon, a small
diner in Portadown. Down the road, a three-story stack of wooden
pallets and discarded furniture was being readied Tuesday afternoon
to be ignited. An Irish national flag topped the stack.
</P>
<P>
   The Protestant Orangemen celebrate the Twelfth of July in honor
of William of Orange's defeat of Catholic James II in 1690. The
victory secured Northern Ireland's position within the United
Kingdom, while the predominately Catholic south continued
struggling for independence until 1922 when the Republic of Ireland
was born.
</P>
<P>
   While members of the Orange Order say they are only celebrating
what for them is equivalent to the Fourth of July for Americans,
Catholics consider the marches triumphal shows of power by the
majority Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   Angered that they were forbidden by the government on July 2
from parading through two Catholic neighborhoods, the Orange Order
called for a province-wide protest. Protestants and their
supporters have engaged in a 10-day spree of violence and
disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   David Hillditch, a member of the Orange Order, told reporters
that the press has blown the disruptions out of proportion.
``Protests have been 90 percent peaceful,'' he said.
``Unfortunately a few of the hotspots have captured the
headlines.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, police used trained dogs to force a crowd of
Protestant loyalists to retreat from a barricade erected to block
marchers from entering the Catholic enclave near Drumcree.
Protestants have been outraged by the wall, which some have
compared to the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   After days of attacks on Catholic homes and businesses, a rural
Orange Order meeting hall was firebombed early Tuesday, sending six
Protestants to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday afternoon, businesses in most towns and cities closed
early to give their employees a chance to get home before sunset.
By 4:30 p.m. (local time), downtown Belfast was nearly deserted.
</P>
<P>
   A leading clergyman warned that the violence threatened to spin
out of control. Patrick Walsh, the Bishop of Down and Conner, said:
``What is happening across the whole of Northern Ireland is
intolerable. We are in danger of sliding into anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   Police have come under attack for not doing more to stop the
violence. Catholics say police haven't done enough to protect them
or to crack down on Orange protests. Scores of Catholic properties
have been attacked, including two churches in predominantly
Protestant towns.
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Flanagan, the chief of the Royal Ulster Constabulary,
defended the actions of the police, but added that it was important
for police not provoke even stronger reactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to judge each set of circumstances on its merits and
we have to behave proportionately,'' Flanagan said. ``Our officers
on the ground have to consider whether their intervention will make
things worse., so they have to decide how to intervene and when to
intervene.''
</P>
<P>
   Police hope that Wednesday will bring an end to the strife.
</P>
<P>
   Since July 2, authorities have recorded 280 attacks on security
forces, with 57 police officers and soldiers wounded, authorities
said Tuesday. Nearly 1,000 gasoline bombs have been seized, and 88
vehicles hijacked and burned. Police have arrested 146 suspected
rioters.

   ROME _ In an inverted salute to Mussolini's dream of Fascism
through physical culture, the Stadio dei Marmi, a 1937 track
stadium ringed by colossal marble nude athletes is filled again _

the Stadio dei Marmi, is up for sale, part of a long inventory of
public buildings that the government is seeking to sell to reduce
its debt and meet European Union budget targets.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing groups, including a small neofascist party, Movimento
Sociale Italiano, have papered the streets with leaflets and
posters that say, ``Hands off the Foro Mussolini,'' its original,
and still taboo, name.
</P>
<P>
   Alleanza Nazionale, a right-wing party that has severed its ties
to Fascism, calls it Foro Italico, in posters that scream,
``Culture cannot be sold!''
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the heated politics, however, the ado over the Foro
Italico signals a broader shift in Italian sensibilities. Fascist
architecture, long ignored or despised by most Italians as a
disturbing reminder of an ignoble period of their history, is
enjoying a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started studying this architecture, people told me I
was crazy, that it was `ugly and fascist,''' Giorgio Muratore, a
professor of architecture at the University of Rome, said. ``It is
only recently that people are willing to say, `It's fascist, but it
is beautiful.'''
</P>
<P>
   Muratore has spent 30 years promoting a reappraisal of
architects like Luigi Moretti, a Mussolini follower who designed,
among other structures, a 1934 fencing pavilion, the Casa della
Scherma, which is considered the architectural jewel of the Foro
Italico. In 1981, the Justice Ministry took over the building to
hold members of the Red Brigade terrorist group and remains a
high-security courthouse, pending its sale. Moretti, who died in
1973, also designed the Watergate Hotel in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners have long vaunted the ingenuity and daring of the
Fascist architects, who sought to blend the classicism of ancient
Rome with 20th-century functionalism and rationalism. Architecture
was Mussolini's favorite mode of propaganda, and he commissioned
monumental projects like the Foro Italico and E.U.R., a vast state
office park that includes the stark Palazzo della Civilta del
Lavoro, known as the square Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``These architects were young, they were convinced Fascists,''
said Giorgio Ciucci, an architectural historian who heads the
National Academy of St. Luke here. ``It was a revolutionary
movement based on youth and radical change. Architects were the
interpreters of the revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   All over Italy, post offices, railway stations and entire towns
like Sabaudia, a seaside resort, reflect the grandiosity, but also
the boldness, of a totalitarian regime that took power in 1922 and
ended in 1943, when Mussolini was overthrown. He and his mistress
were executed in 1945 and hanged by their feet in a square in
Milan.
</P>
<P>
   From the end of World War II until recently, much Italian
thinking on Fascist architecture was molded by Bruno Zevi, a Jewish
architectural critic who fled the Fascists' racial laws in 1940,
returned to Italy in 1945 and, until his death in January,
pilloried architectural classicism, modern and even ancient, as the
reflection of oppression and totalitarianism. He often said, only
half-jokingly, that the ``square Colosseum'' should be blown up.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Italians, awash in ancient ruins and medieval,
Renaissance and Baroque treasures, mostly ignored or mocked Fascist
buildings as exemplars of bad taste. The reappraisal by
intellectuals began in earnest in the early 1990s, when the end of
the Cold War eased the the fierce politicalization of architecture,
and Fascism as a viable political movement seemed long dead.
</P>
<P>
   Younger critics and professors began detaching aesthetics from
the taint of ideology. Exhibitions, retrospectives, history books
and tourist guides signaled revived interest. In 1996, Sergio
Poretti, a professor of architecture at the University of Rome,
began publishing Do.co.mo.mo, an artsy biannual journal devoted
entirely to Fascist art and architecture.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over the Foro Italico, however, has sparked a
more general re-evaluation of Fascist architecture. The property,
which includes the Stadio Olimpico, the largest soccer stadium
here, could bring in as much as $490 million, according to some
estimates. At least five groups, including American investment
companies, are vying to be selected to help the Italian treasury
broker the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the treasury selected a division of American
Appraisal Holding, the Italian branch of American Appraisal
Associates of Milwaukee to help it assess the Foro Italico market
value.
</P>
<P>
   The property is being managed by the Italian National Olympic
Committee, which uses many of the sports areas for training. The
Stadio dei Marmi is being used by Big Gym, a fitness company, under
a summer lease.
</P>
<P>
   The center-right opposition seized the sale as a political
bludgeon, complaining that foreigners could end up erecting
McDonald's arches over a chunk of modern Italian history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absurd,'' Alessandra Mussolini, a granddaughter of the
dictator, said. ``It's not just a part of history. It's a part of
Rome.''
</P>
<P>
   Mussolini, a member of Parliament for Alleanza Nazionale, said
she had no problems with the Foro Italico's style _ or history. ``I
like everything Fascist, and especially the architecture,'' she
said. ``I live in a 1930s building.''
</P>
<P>
   Culture Minister Giovanna Melandri said most of the 16 Foro
Italico lots were labeled historic sites, which, under Italian law,
sharply limits their use and alterations. That did not mollify
critics on the right or left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough to say, `We imposed so many conditions on the
sale that no one will want to buy it,''' Muratore, a Communist,
said. ``The Italian state should say that the Foro Italico, like
the Colosseum, is not for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   A new generation of Italians seem to like the look of the Foro
Italico, without worrying about its provenance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beautiful, imposing, it's majestic,'' Maria Rosaria
Iorio, 20, a major in political science at the University of Rome,
said as she gazed up at the Stadio dei Marmi while awaiting
aerobics class.
</P>
<P>
   Neither she nor her friend Luisa De Vita, 19, was sure when or
why it was built. ``I don't think its ancient,'' Iorio said.
``Maybe 19th or 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Told that it was built under Mussolini, the women shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We studied him in school, and he didn't only do bad things,''
Iorio said. ``He built a lot of towns and schools.''
</P>
<P>
   De Vita agreed, saying: ``We have gotten so used to skyscrapers
and glass office towers, but this is closer to our roots. It's
classical, but with a modern feel.''

GORE CALLS ON BUSH TO SUPPORT PATIENTS' RIGHTS BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., Mich. Ga.)   By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ Vice President Al Gore on Tuesday prodded
his Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, to get
behind a bipartisan patients' bill of rights now before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for Governor Bush to show us whose side he is on,''
said the vice president, speaking at the University of Arkansas for
Medical Sciences, where his campaign aides had set up several boxes
of the game ``Operation'' that they labeled ``Bush's Health Plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was introduced by a breast surgeon who told of a patient
who had lost her breast unnecessarily because her insurance company
had refused to pay for an MRI test that would have shown that her
cancer was localized and could have been treated with a lumpectomy
and radiation instead of a mastectomy.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd cheered as the vice president criticized a Republican
alternative to the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an old trick,'' Gore said. ``Stick a feather in your
hat and call it macaroni.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was also harshly critical of insurance
companies that offer bonuses to doctors each time they decline to
refer patients to a specialist.
</P>
<P>
   The current system, Gore said, not only hurts patients but puts
doctors in the position of being forced to ``play games'' with the
truth in dealing with insurance companies in order to be true to
the Hippocratic oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to give these medical decisions back to the
doctors,'' the vice president said. ``We have got to rise up and
demand the leaders of this do-nothing-for-people Congress put the
people first for a change.''
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan bill, introduced by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.,
and Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., has passed the House and is one
vote short of passing the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Bush campaign answered that Gore was
``continuing his ``I'm not a leader tour''' and ``attempting to
shift blame for the lack'' of patient protections.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has signed a patient protection bill into law in Texas
after initially fighting another version of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   On NBC's ``Today Show' in New York, where the vice president
began the day, Gore corrected Katie Couric when she said he had
been ``assailing'' Bush on the issue. ``I'm not assailing him
personally, Katie,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he went on to say that Bush, as the de facto head of the
party, was, along with Republican congressional leaders, beholden
to drug companies who oppose meaningful patient protections or
prescription drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to a woman in Missouri last week who has to eat
macaroni and cheese every day'' so she can afford her medications,
he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After the show, Gore worked the crowd outside Rockefeller
Center, where he competed for attention with the ``Today''
weatherman, Al Roker, who complained that he was losing his
audience.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore shook hands and made funny faces at a couple of
babies, he heard more complaints over the loudspeaker. Inside the
studio, another guest, the television judge Judy Sheindlin, was
irate that the green room had been ``taken over'' by Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the vice president ought to get me a muffin,'' she
said, indicating that her vote may rest on the request.
</P>
<P>
   Gore later got down on one knee to serve her honor a muffin.

THE END OF SYPHILIS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In most industrialized countries, a combination of penicillin
and sound public-health work has virtually eliminated syphilis. Not
so in the United States, but the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention believes it could be done here for just $15 million.
Congress should quickly approve the funds, so that a historic
opportunity is not lost.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons that scientists do not understand, syphilis goes
through seven- to 10-year cycles of low and high incidence. After a
peak in 1990 of 50,000 new cases in the United States, in 1999 it
was at its lowest recorded incidence in the nation's history, just
7,000 new cases. Aiding the elimination effort is the fact that the
disease is concentrated geographically _ just 25 of the nation's
3,100 counties account for about half of all cases.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC believes that with a concerted effort now, at the low
point of the cycle, the disease could be driven down to 1,000 cases
scattered across the country, virtually eliminating it. Lacking a
vaccine, officials have no hope of eradicating it altogether, but
free testing, penicillin treatment, and notification of sexual
partners have been effective in fighting it.
</P>
<P>
   Limiting its incidence to small outbreaks, as European countries
have done, would be a triumph. Left untreated, late-stage syphilis
can wreak havoc on a range of organs. Pregnant women can pass it on
to their unborn children, many of whom die. Babies born with it are
often blind or mentally retarded. Syphilis greatly increases HIV
infection rates.
</P>
<P>
   There would undoubtedly be more pressure to fund the CDC's $15
million request if it were not for the demographics of syphilis,
which is concentrated among low-income African-Americans. Treatment
for the disease has no celebrity advocates as do breast and
prostate cancer, AIDS, and Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   There is also sentiment on Capitol Hill to divert some of the
$15 million toward greater efforts against other, more common
sexually transmitted diseases, such as chlamydia and human
papillomavirus. All STDs deserve increased funding, but it would be
criminal to miss this chance to make syphilis a disease of the
country's past and not its future.

 &HT;    Internet Air charter provider feeling lack of funding
 &HT;    By Russell Grantham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - An Internet air charter provider said its fortunes
won't get airborne again until it finds money to replace $5 million
promised by one backer who reneged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize the frustration that you guys must be feeling,''
company President Todd Bottorff told about a dozen investors
Tuesday at the company's annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Bottorff, 32, who joined the company two months ago, was
alluding to flightserv's climb from 25 cents a share to $12 a share
over 15 months, then its dive to as low as 25 cents since March.
Flightserv.com's shares closed Tuesday at about 44 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Bottorff said his focus is keeping expenses down and finding
capital to market the company's business, which connects business
travelers with empty seats on private chartered jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Day one, when I got on board, we were all vigorously pursuing
that capital,'' he said. ``That is an area that has been
significantly under-emphasized.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottorff was named president and chief operating officer in May,
replacing C. Beverly Lance as president.
</P>
<P>
   Lance remains flightserv.com's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   As with many Internet firms, flightserv.com's hunt for new cash
got tougher after the recent bear market for tech companies spooked
investors from many start-ups with negative cash flows and unproven
business models.
</P>
<P>
   Flightserv.com launched its ``Private Seats'' service between
Atlanta's Peachtree-DeKalb Airport and Teterboro Airport near New
York City about two months ago, with plans to serve up to 100
cities in a year.
</P>
<P>
   But company officials said flightserv.com's plans stalled after
Bahamas-based Acqua Wellington Value Fund Ltd. didn't honor the
second part of an agreement to invest $10 million by the end of
February.
</P>
<P>
   After investing $5 million in January, Acqua Wellington
``effectively reneged'' on its promise to invest more, said
flightserv Chairman Arthur Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't put it in, and we didn't have the money to put
into (a marketing) plan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it is ``evaluating'' whether to take legal
action against Acqua Wellington.
</P>
<P>
   Acqua Wellington officials could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Flightserv.com has averaged about one flight a week of one or
two passengers who manage to find its Web site at
www.flightserv.com, Bottorff said. ``I think the last flight we had
is about two weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a strategic alliance announced last month with
Atlanta-based Worldspan offers the chance to market flightserv's
services through more than 20,000 travel agents. The electronic
travel information service is owned by units of Delta Air Lines,
Northwest Airlines and Trans World Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Flightserv.com is in ``advanced discussions with a few funding
parties'' to provide new capital infusion, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Flightserv.com has ``a long way to go,'' said investor Matthew
J. Lee, director of reservations sales for AirTran. ``It's a novel
idea. They've oposals aimed at assisting low-income Americans.
</P>
<P>
   `DO-NOTHING-CONGRESS' COUNTER-TOUR
</P>
<P>
   Continuing his attack on what he calls a ``do-nothing-for-people
Republican Congress'' beholden to special interests, Al Gore said
today that the same ``wealthy special interests'' financing George
W. Bush's campaign are blocking progress in Congress on health and
minimum-wage legislation. ``What's going on in Washington is that
this Congress has failed to pass legislation that has very strong
bipartisan support,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T MESS WITH THE JUDGE
</P>
<P>
   It was Judge Judy who followed Al Gore's appearance on NBC's
``Today'' show this morning for an interview, and TV's famously
cantankerous courtroom judge wasn't too happy. Judy Sheindlin (her
real name) started by complaining that she'd arrived hungry and
looking forward to the ``green room'' treats, but that Gore and his
entourage had taken it over for security reasons. Judge Judy, to
host Matt Lauer: ``I think that the vice president ought to get me
a muffin. In fact, I think he should get me several muffins.'' An
apologetic Gore returned to the set with a loaded muffin tray,
knelt down on a knee and offered her a muffin. Still, she was
uncommittal about her vote.
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING FOR A LATE-INNING RALLY
</P>
<P>
   With the National Governors' Association concluding its four-day
meeting, Democratic state executives reportedly were conceding that
George W. Bush has emerged from the early stages of the campaign
the more likable candidate, hence his slight lead in national
polls. The trend has them concerned but not panicked, according to
The Associated Press. They say Al Gore will recover when voters
focus on issues. Bush's folksy style plays well when voters aren't
paying attention, the governors said, but Gore's intensity and
seriousness should be a better fit when the campaign heats up.
</P>
<P>
   GO AHEAD, HE DARES YOU
</P>
<P>
   Democrats would likely have to write off Pennsylvania, a key
battleground state they won in the last two presidential elections,
if Gov. Tom Ridge becomes George W. Bush's running mate, President
Clinton said. ``It would be a lot harder to carry it with (Ridge)on
the ticket,'' Clinton told the Patriot-News of Harrisburg after
speaking to the National Governors' Association meeting in State
College. Ridge, an abortion-rights supporter, is anathema to many
in the Republican Party's core constituency.
</P>
<P>
   IT MUST BE THOSE JUICED-UP BASEBALLS
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans reported that they have raised $90 million so
far this election cycle _ almost as much as they collected for the
entire 1998 election. Party officials said they are on track to
raise a record $125 million by the end of the year. On the other
side, House Democrats reported raising $60 million during the
previous 18 months _ more than the $42 million raised during the
entire 1997-98 election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   SPEND IT OR LOSE IT
</P>
<P>
   As they prepare to accept their parties' presidential
nominations, both George W. Bush and Al Gore are draining their
campaign treasuries. Most of it will be spent on staff, travel and
expenses associated with the upcoming national party conventions.
Bush also is developing a last-minute TV advertising campaign.
After the conventions, neither candidate will be permitted to raise
or spend private money, except to pay legal and accounting costs.
Instead, each will receive $67.6 million in taxpayer funds to
finance their fall campaigns. Bush had $7.1 million on hand as of
May 31; Gore had $9.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ADS DOING DOUBTFUL JOB
</P>
<P>
   A month after beginning a multimillion-dollar TV ad campaign, Al
Gore is still languishing in the polls, seemingly unable to stir
the enthusiasm of apathetic voters. The Democratic National
Committee has spent about $11 million on the ads in 17 states, but
there has been little apparent movement.etween 5 and 13 percentage
points nationally.
</P>
<P>
   MEANWHILE, BACK IN TEXAS
</P>
<P>
   One thing George W. Bush has known in his more than five years
as governor of Texas is prosperity. But now Texas is facing a
budget shortfall as high as $750 million, fueled by deficits in
Medicaid and other state programs and rising costs for prison
inmates, according to the Houston Chronicle. The Legislative Budget
Board was meeting privately with state budget officials to plan an
emergency appropriations bill for January. Rob Junell, chairman of
the House Appropriations Committee, said the state's economy will
provide enough new revenues to cover the shortfall. State Democrats
are blaming the shortfall on Bush's insistence on a huge tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   TO BE CONTACTED IS TO BE IN THE GAME
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. John Kasich's staff wanted it known that their boss
has been approached in regard to the Republican running mate
search. The Ohioan was asked to provide background information to
former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who is heading George W.
Bush's search effort, said Kasich spokesman Bruce Cuthbertson.
Kasich told the Columbus Dispatch: ``I have been contacted. That is
all I will say, period.'' Kasich, 48, is not running for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   POWER PLANTS AND SENATE POWER
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton, who has made lower utility rates a cornerstone
pledge of her Senate campaign, criticized the New York state
government for allowing the construction of new power plants along
the Hudson River without having a plan to assess demand. She also
said that New York's attempt to deregulate utility costs has not
been as successful as neighboring states', and that New York has a
``bottleneck'' bureaucratic system that's stunting competition
among power companies. Clinton called the upstate region's economy
her ``No. 1 priority'' if elected.
</P>
<P>
   REVAMPED CONVENTION
</P>
<P>
   Education, Social Security and the need for an inclusive party
are among the major themes of this year's Republican National
Convention, organizers say. George W. Bush wants to emphasize these
issues although they are more often discussed at Democratic events.
He wants to project a different image of Republicans to the nation
during the July 31-Aug. 3 convention in Philadelphia. ``Ours will
be a different kind of convention for a different kind of
Republican,'' said convention co-chairman Andrew Card.
</P>
<P>
   DE-FENSE! DE-FENSE!
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, typing answers to online questions on the Washington
Post Web site, said the failure of a test for a national missile
defense system doesn't mean the idea is doomed, but he criticized
the version supported by opponent George W. Bush as ``more
expensive and less likely to work.'' Bush has said he's determined
to push ahead toward a missile defense system to protect the United
States and its allies even if Russia opposes it as a violation of
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Gore wants Russia to amend
the treaty to allow a more limited system covering the 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   GIRLS JUST WANNA HAVE FUN
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore says her penchant for spontaneity and desire for fun
will continue even if her husband is elected and she becomes first
lady. Otherwise, ``It could be an isolating life, if you weren't
careful about that,'' she said in a Washington Post interview.
Tipper Gore once agreed to an an event in New Mexico so she could
ride in a hot air balloon, and in Florida her staff made a detour
so she could ride Space Mountain at Disney World three times.

DEFLATED MISSILE DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If taxpayers are being asked to spend $60 billion or more on a
national missile defense that may not be able to defend the nation
against intercontinental ballistic missiles, then aren't proponents
of the unworkable system degrading the nation's defense?
</P>
<P>
   This question arises following the mechanical failure of last
week's missile interceptor test.
</P>
<P>
   Its scientific critics contend that the crucial flaws of the
system that failed in last weekend's test flight have nothing to do
with the things that went awry during that trial run. It ought to
be possible to make the missile interceptor separate from its
booster rocket, the critics assume, and there is no reason to
believe the one balloon accompanying the target warhead will not
inflate properly in future tests.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday's uninflated balloon does serve as a road sign
pointing to the fundamental incapacity of the proposed system to do
what it will be asked to do. MIT physics professor Ted Postol, an
experienced specialist in the field of missile defense, has
analyzed data from the first fly-by test of the system and found
that the infrared sensors on its exoatmospheric kill vehicle could
not discriminate between warheads and simple countermeasures.
</P>
<P>
   When they do inflate outside the atmosphere, inexpensive mylar
balloon decoys can confound the technology of the infrared sensor _
provided that the light they emit is not much brighter than the
light emitted by a warhead hiding among hundreds of decoys that any
missile-making regime will be able to deploy. The balloon that
didn't inflate in Saturday's test flight was the only decoy
accompanying the warhead to be intercepted. It had a blatantly
different shape, and its brightness was so different from the
warhead's that the kill vehicle's sensor could hardly mistake one
for the other. In a word, the test was rigged; even if it had
succeeded, it would have proved nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Before heedless politicians and defense contractors stampede
Americans into paying for a system that may make the nation less
secure, the capabilities of the proposed system should be evaluated
by distinguished scientists who are truly independent.
</P>
<P>
   Haste, in this case, risks the greatest waste.

   NEW YORK _ It's time to rain on the CowParade, the influx of
painted bovine forms that has been choking the sidewalks and parks
of New York City, Stamford, Conn., and West Orange, N.J., since
mid-June. The 500 New York cows and their suburban cousins won't be
leaving until fall, when they will be auctioned off for charity.
</P>
<P>
   COMPLAINT NO. 1: These cows are un-American. Most American cows
have their horns removed at birth. These cows, which have both
udders and horns, are Swiss milking cows.
</P>
<P>
   NO. 2: Herd mentality. Zurich had the first cow parade, Cows on
Parade, in 1998 (800 cows). Chicago got the second one, in 1999,
after a shoe salesman from Chicago saw the Zurich cow parade and
decided his city had to have a bovine event, too. (Chicago had 340
cows.) In 1999 CowParade Holdings, the for-profit corporation that
owns licensing rights to CowParade and Cows on Parade, asked the
New York City Parks Commissioner, Henry J. Stern, and Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani if New York wanted one. Sure, they said. So now New York
is copying Chicago, a cow town, and Switzerland, a cow country.
</P>
<P>
   NO. 3: Cowmerce. Each cow has been commissioned by a sponsor: a
corporation, community organization, individual or business,
including Hooters, Yahoo, The New York Times and a couple of
steakhouses. For $7,500 the sponsor chooses an artist to paint its
cow or selects a design that was submitted during an open call for
artists earlier this year. After publicizing the event through arts
organizations and news releases, CowParade received some 1,200
designs.
</P>
<P>
   NO. 4: Bad cow disease. During the open call, three cows were
rejected _ the Moonica Lewinsky cow, the Hasidic cow and a cow
covered with butcher's marks and unbecoming remarks about butchery
designed by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
</P>
<P>
   NO. 5: Moonotonous. Every cow is made of 100 pounds of
fiberglass that has been molded into one of three poses: standing
(head up), grazing (head down) and supine. All cows were made by
Silvestri Inc. in Los Angeles, or by the Resource Factory in
Sarasota, Fla., both manufacturers of fiberglass figures. The only
acts left to the artists who are picked by the sponsors are
painting, decorating and naming their cows. A cow floating on its
back in an inner tube near the McGraw-Hill building looked like the
work of an udder renegade.
</P>
<P>
   NO. 6: Cowmeras. Too many tourists taking too many pictures.
</P>
<P>
   NO. 7: Puns for names. Tutancowmon, Cowapatra, Cowlerina,
Cowleidoscope, Cowmooter, Taxi Cow (used five times), Picowsso
(three times), Moondrian (twice), Mootisse (once), MooMa (four
times), Moo York (a dozen times), Moomaid, Moo Indigo, MooShoe and
Herd on the Street (three times). Toss in the requisite Holy Cows
(used twice) and Sacred Cows (seven times), and you get the
picture. These cows are a public moosance.

   There's a fondness for Nader on the left. He's morally pure and
utterly upright; his Ichabody thinness underscores his ascetic
devotion to The Cause. He has substantial, tangible
accomplishments. Seatbelts. Safety glass. Mandatory
child-decapitation systems in cars, also known as airbags. The
enshrinement of the trial lawyer as the arbiter of social justice.
... Well, let's back up a bit.
</P>
<P>
   There's a fondness for Nader on the left. Seatbelts!
</P>
<P>
   And so much more. But if Nader regards the Dems as a pallid
reflection of contemporary liberalism, what does his new party, the
Greens, desire? Just visit their Web site, www.greenparty.org, and
read the merry platform. They want your money, your job, your
freedom and your car. In return you get industrial hemp and really
bad TV.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few of their, ah, provocative demands:
</P>
<P>
   A six-hour work day with no cut in pay. (The government gives
you a ``second paycheck'' to make up the difference.) One-year paid
educational leave for every seven years worked. ``Federally
financed universal health care'' _ five words that spell utter,
irrevocable, national insolvency. Free child care. Free education
through graduate school. Yes, that's what will make America strong:
more graduate students. Guaranteed family income of at least
$26,000 per year for a mother with three children, with an extra
$3,250 per child.
</P>
<P>
   How to pay for this stuff? Nader's party has that figured out,
too. Simple: ``Build into the progressive income tax a 100 percent
tax on all income over 10 times the minimum wage.'' In the amusing
world of the Nader party, people will still work hard and produce
the excess revenue even if it's taxed at 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Having ruined the economy, Nader's party will ruin your
evenings: ``Re-appropriate six prime-time hours a day of commercial
broadcast time on each station for real public service
broadcasting.'' Wonderful: mandatory cable-access.
</P>
<P>
   Here's your new schedule: 4-5 p.m.: Cartoon hour. Today: Tom and
Jerry mend their differences through mediation and visualized
peace-based scenarios. 5-6 p.m.: PETA presents the Dinnertime
Parade of Slaughterhouse Horrors. 7-10 p.m.: Blurry, underlit video
of people with tremendous BO talking about hemp. A tax on the
broadcasters would pay for this programming. Of course, after six
months of this dreck, the broadcasters would have no revenue to pay
the taxes _ and that's when Nader's party would happily nationalize
them.
</P>
<P>
   If they hadn't been already demolished.
</P>
<P>
   The platform of Nader's party would ``require breakup of any
firm with more than 10 percent market share unless it makes a
compelling case every five years in a public regulatory
proceeding.'' It's Naderism taken to its logical conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   As is the next plank: ``Mandatory break-up'' of ``the largest
500 U.S. industrial and commercial corporations.'' Good _ take
that, GM! Take that, Microsoft! Let the small businessperson have a
shot, right? Well, the next plank breaks them up, too. Nader's
party calls for the ``Democratic Conversion of Small and Medium
Businesses'' to ``democratic public enterprises'' or co-ops.
</P>
<P>
   It would be voluntary, of course. It's always voluntary at
first. It's always ``voluntary'' until no one goes along. Then the
Citizen's Committee for Economic Security steps in, and it's time
to oil up the guillotine.
</P>
<P>
   But this wouldn't happen right away. Nader's party would have
its hands full with other projects. Again, reading from the
platform: ``Shut down waste incinerators, phase out landfills, and
phase in full recycling.'' Done! ``Abolish the disproportional,
aristocratic U.S. Senate.'' Done! ``Phase out fossil fuels and
phase in clean renewable energy sources.'' Your wish is our
command. Done!
</P>
<P>
   So much for the first day of the rule of Nader's party. It would
get around to abolishing perfume and scented shampoo, but that
would require working more than six hours. Leave that for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And there's still the educational system to fix. Nader's party
is ready to tackle the real enemy: us. ``We support a democratic
public school curriculum ... that replaces Eurocentric with
multicultural textbooks...''
</P>
<P>
   Huzzah: no more Eurocentricism. No more of those ridiculous
European ideas. Bring on the caste system of India, the infanticide
of China, the child-sex industry of Southeast Asia, the polygamy
and homophobia of sub-Saharan Africa, the misogyny of
fundamentalist Islam. In other words, get rid of European beliefs
that have made multicultural societies possible, and replace them
with a constellation of backward, irrational monocultural beliefs
that keep the rest of the world poor and oppressed.
</P>
<P>
   Nice work, Ralph. But of course it's not your platform. It's
just your party.

SPORTS COLUMN: DISTORTED FOCUS 
</HEADLINE>
   By IRA BERKOW    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ George Steinbrenner, who is to baseball what Matthew
Brady, Edward Steichen and Richard Avedon are to photography, is an
expert on focus.
</P>
<P>
   This is what the Yankees' principal owner said Monday in regard
to the Mets' charge after their weekend series that Roger Clemens
purposely hit Mike Piazza in the head with a 92-mph fast ball, and,
to a markedly lesser degree, the protested interference call
against Met first-baseman Todd Zeile.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to take the focus off the fact that they got their
fannies handed to them this time,'' Steinbrenner said about the
Mets, ``and they are a great team. I'm not sure it wasn't a very
wise public relations move for them to take the focus off the way
they were beaten.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bobby Valentine and his people would love to take the
focus off that, and have the people forget about the results.''
</P>
<P>
   What Steinbrenner _ we can just picture him under a black cloth
and behind that old boxy camera _ is really doing is seeking to
return the focus to where he believes the focus has suddenly become
unfocused. That is, on his Bronx Bombers. But his defense of his
pitcher, while understandable, is tasteless, if not reprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   It is undeniable, of course, that the Yankees beat the Mets
three out of four games this weekend, and four out of six in the
Subway Series this year. And forget for a moment that an opposing
player could very well have been killed, or severely maimed for
life by a pitcher whose salary Steinbrenner pays, but recall his
expertise on focus. Examples are long, and legendary:
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't fire the man'': Steinbrenner, at a news conference
announcing the departure of his manager Dick Howser in 1980. Then
in 1987: ``Firing Dick Howser and not re-signing Reggie Jackson
were the two biggest mistakes I ever made with the Yankees.'' And
there was his defense of himself with his fists in 1981 when
attacked by an elevator in Los Angeles after the Yanks were beaten
in the World Series by the Dodgers. And every time the Yanks make a
stupid trade: ``It was my baseball people.'' And whenever they make
a successful move _ well, you get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Steinbrenner may bridle at these observations, saying that
that stuff is old hat, but here we are with a new hat that looks
very much like the old fedora.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner may very well be a flyspeck this side of objective
in his viewpoint. And it says here that the umpire's call, which
awarded Chuck Knoblauch second base after initially being thrown
out when he was forced to run around Zeile, was the correct one.
Either Zeile, dreamily spectating directly in the base path, was
canny and knew better, or he's a dolt and didn't. Either way, the
Mets' protest of the game to the league office should be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The Clemens pitch, which produced a concussion in Piazza despite
his wearing a plastic helmet for protection, is another matter.
It's a well-worn axiom, as Steinbrenner adds, that fastball
pitchers ``have to live on the inside.'' And brushbacks are a
century-old part of baseball. But that doesn't make it right.
Steinbrenner said: ``I know Roger, I know he's a family guy who
loves his kids, and there's no way a future Hall of Famer like him
is going to try to hurt somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not. But Clemens is famous for hitting people, and is a
virtuoso at ``chin music.'' I remember talking to Seattle players a
few years ago who said that Clemens hits every Mariner rookie the
first time he sees him _ ``to send a message.'' A message that can
be perilous.
</P>
<P>
   I will never forget Tony Conigliaro of the Red Sox being hit in
the face in 1967 with a fast ball thrown by Jack Hamilton, who had
a reputation like Clemens'. Conigliaro was a 22-year-old slugger,
and on his way to a wonderful career. People at the game recall
with horror the sound of Hamilton's fast ball cracking into his
face, like the smashing of a melon.
</P>
<P>
   Tony C. was out for the remainder of that season, and the entire
1968 season. He returned to the game, but his eyesight was
impaired, his head forever different from before. He retired in
1975, suffered a heart attack in 1982 and died in 1990 at age 45.
</P>
<P>
   And Clemens' message to Piazza, on a night when his control was
superb: You must pay for going 7-for-12 against me lifetime, with
three homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitching inside'' is one thing. Head-hunting is another.
Baseball should no longer tolerate that murderous tradition. And
George Steinbrenner, sometimes, yes, a leader in positive ways in
baseball, could have judiciously led here, too. But his focus in
this grave case was not only self-serving, it was shamelessly
distorted.

 DOW GAINS FOR 3rd STRAIGHT SESSION  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Dow Jones industrial average rose for a third
consecutive session Tuesday, lifted by continued good earnings news
from old-line cyclical companies and optimism that the Federal
Reserve may have finished raising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Led by International Paper, which reported better-than-expected
second-quarter results Tuesday, and Alcoa, which beat Wall Street
estimates on Monday, the Dow gained 80.61 points, or 0.8 percent,
to 10,727.19.
</P>
<P>
   ``International Paper and Alcoa sort of set the tone and brought
back a lot of the cyclical areas of the market,'' said James
Paulson, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management.
``Technology stocks faded late in the day, but by and large most of
the market was pretty strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Strength in cyclical stocks as well as good performances from
drug, oil services and integrated oil companies led the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index, which rose 5.26 points, or 0.4 percent, to
1,480.88.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks did not fare so well.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 23.87 points, or 0.6 percent, to
3,956.42. JDS Uniphase, which fell for a second consecutive day,
and Yahoo were among the biggest losers.
</P>
<P>
   Worries about second-quarter earnings helped to drag Yahoo down
4{, to 105{. But after the market closed, the company reported
earnings that beat Wall Street estimates by 2 cents a share. After
hours, Yahoo rebounded and traded as high as 114.
</P>
<P>
   International Paper was among the best-performing Dow stocks. It
surged 3[, to 35 1/16. And Alcoa rose for a second consecutive
session, closing at 32{, up 3.
</P>
<P>
   The gains spilled over into other so-called cyclical stocks. The
Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index jumped 11.53 points, to 492.16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Concern about an unfriendly Fed is persistently coming out of
the market,'' said Jonathan Olesky, head of block trading at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter. ``That is causing investors to show interest
in rate-sensitive areas like papers, chemicals, metals and autos.
It has been a pretty broad move.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial service stocks, which would also stand to benefit if
the Fed stops raising interest rates, also did well Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup rose 1|, to 66~. Merrill Lynch gained 2 13/16, to 129.
And Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette rose 2[, to 47{.
</P>
<P>
   Integrated oil and oil services stocks did well after BP Amoco
announced a sharp increase in capital spending for the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Schlumberger, a chief supplier to BP Amoco, gained 6 5/64, to 74
61/64. Halliburton rose 4 47/64, to 46 49/64. And Baker Hughes
gained 3 29/32, to 34\.
</P>
<P>
   Among the big oil companies, BP Amoco gained 1 3/16, to 51 5/16.
And Exxon Mobil closed at 80 9/16, up 2 7/16.

&HT;     LAWMAKER URGES 25 PERCENT CUT IN S.F. AIDS FUNDING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Government investigators told Congress Tuesday that
San Francisco gets nearly twice the federal AIDS funding per
patient than other cities receive, a finding that a key Republican
lawmaker said was indefensible.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said research by the General
Accounting Office showed that San Francisco receives $5,958 in
federal Ryan White program money for each AIDS case, while 50 other
cities hard hit by the epidemic receive an average of $3,000.
Coburn called for slashing the city's share by 25 percent over five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to do is make sure that the black teenager with
HIV in my district has access to the same funding as someone living
in the middle of San Francisco,'' Coburn told the House
subcommittee on health and environment. The panel is drafting the
House version of the five-year Ryan White program, which
</P>
<P>
   will then be melded into a compromise with the Senate-passed
version.
</P>
<P>
   The Ryan White program provides federal aid for medication and
health care for people who don't have private insurance but who
aren't poor enough to qualify for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation sponsored by Coburn and Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif.,
would cut San Francisco's share by $4.5 million over five years,
from $35 million a year to $31.5 million, according to
congressional staffers, unless Congress dramatically increases
total funding for the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to focus on eliminating disparities in service,''
Waxman said.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn said the current formula essentially pays for San
Francisco residents who have already died of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't defend that,'' Coburn said. ``No one can defend
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Janet Heinrich, associate director of the GAO _ the
investigative arm of Congress _ told the panel that the HIV/AIDS
epidemic is spreading to woman and children and that the geographic
focus of the disease is becoming more diffuse.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Claude Earl Fox, administrator of the federal Health
Resources and Services Administration, which runs the program,
agreed there is a need to reexamine how the funds are doled out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of inequities,'' Fox testified. ``We agree you
should not be disadvantaged by where you live.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``We do believe that communities should be
protected from these funding shifts. We do not want to see huge
disruptions in funding.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., said a 25 percent cut in San
Francisco's AIDS funding would be ``potentially devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   Eshoo said it would amount to ``an abrupt pulling out of the rug
from under the program. It would leave the Bay Area without a
safety net.''
</P>
<P>
   Eshoo said the ``tidy, cookie-cutter numbers game they have put
out'' is misleading. She said the GAO report fails to consider that
many people with AIDS live longer than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Eshoo complained that the distribution formula undercounts the
number of people with AIDS because it assumes that people with the
disease will die within 10 years of being diagnosed. But, as a
result of new drug therapies, AIDS patients are living longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bay Area is being penalized for keeping people healthy,''
Eshoo said.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Dillon, public policy director for the San Francisco AIDS
Foundation, who attended the hearing, said afterward that the
city's per-patient cost is higher than other places because the
cost of living there is so inflated.
</P>
<P>
   Dillon also said San Francisco needs more federal funding
because of the high concentration of people with AIDS in the city _
51 cases per 100,000, the fourth highest in the country behind New
York City, Fort Lauderdale and Miami, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   When the Ryan White program began in 1991, payments to
communities were based on a formula that took into account a city's
total number of AIDS cases, both living and dead. San Francisco's
share of the money was relatively large because the epidemic had
started there a decade earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Congress changed the funding formula in 1996 to base the
distribution of money on the number of living AIDS patients. This
step would have slashed San Francisco's funding, except Congress
specifically limited the cuts to avoid damaging existing programs.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne White, the mother of Ryan White, the hemophiliac teenager
from Kokomo, Ind., who contracted the disease through tainted blood
and died in 1990 at age 19, choked back tears and urged Congress to
``keep this program strong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I witnessed first hand the ravages of this disease'' she said.
``As a mother, I just wanted to reach out and make everything
better, but I couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the Care Act ``makes real Ryan's dream of compassion
Ryan never understood those who wanted to deny care to people with
AIDS.''

   Editors, managing editors, wire editors:
</P>
<P>
   Since Sunday, June 4, and continuing for six weeks, The New York
Times has been publishing a series of articles, ``How Race Is Lived
in America.'' The series is the outcome of a yearlong effort by a
team of Times reporters to capture some of the voices of ordinary
people and some of the troubling issues that Americans continue to
face. These stories, two or three each week, are approximately
6,000-7,000 words. The News Service will move each story in
advance, and an abridged version will also move, at approximately
3,000 words. They will move in the ``a'' news category and will
carry a slug of the form BC-RACE-SLUG-NYT. Because the articles are
organized into chapters, papers with severe space restraints may
choose to spread a single article over several days.
</P>
<P>
   This story, for papers of Thursday, July 13, will be filed
tonight, in full and abridged versions:
</P>
<P>
   RACE-HOUSTON (Houston) _ In Houston, the fourth-largest city in
the U.S., blacks, Anglos and Hispanics each make up roughly a third
of the population. So the election in 1998 of Lee P. Brown as the
city's first black mayor was more than a celebration of victory for
blacks. It was also a testament to how racial and ethnic groups in
Houston had put aside their suspicions and rivalries and come
together largely out of self-interest to achieve power.
</P>
<P>
   At Brown's inaugural was Richard G. Castaneda, 54, a
Mexican-American who owned an engineering firm. Only rows away sat
Richard W. Lewis, 51, a white man and a Republican with a large
stake in Brown's victory. Lewis had nudged Castaneda, a business
associate, to help the campaign. Brian G. Smith, who is black, also
had a lot riding on Brown's victory. Smith, an architect who runs
his own construction inspection company, had worked, like Lewis, as
a Brown fund-raiser and with both Lewis and Castaneda on the new
mayor's transition team.
</P>
<P>
   Access, influence, money: All had been part of the political
calculus for Castaneda, Smith and Lewis. All three had put
practical considerations ahead of racial ones. And in the two and a
half years since Brown's inauguration, the pragmatism that drew the
three men together has begun to bear fruit in the form of new
business and political alliances. Their lives do intersect
professionally, and they may get together for the rare social
occasion, yet the three men still live in largely segregated
worlds. By Mireya Navarro.

   RACE-COPS-DRUGS (New York) _ On Friday, Feb. 25, at 5 p.m.,
there wasn't a single narcotics officer on the streets of Harlem.
Everyone was being held inside on standby in case of a race riot.
The Amadou Diallo verdict was about to come down. The whites _
officers like Sgt. Maria Brogli and Detectives Lee Macklowe and
John Montes _ hoped the four Diallo officers would be found not
guilty. The blacks _ detectives like Johnny Gonzalez and the
undercovers Derrick and Rob _ felt they should be found guilty on
at least some counts. No case in recent years has hit the police
closer to home. The 1998 killing of a black man by four panicky
white policemen touched every narcotics officer _ black and white _

   RACE-HIP-HOP (Undated) _ Billy Wimsatt, 27, was born as rap
music was being invented by blacks and Latinos in the South Bronx.
What began as party music became their cry of ghetto pain and their
great hope for a way out. And as hip-hop blossomed into the center
of youth culture, Wimsatt and lots of other white kids found in it
a way to flee their own orderly world by discovering a sexier, more
provocative one. He regarded hip-hop as a bold modern hope to ease
some of the abrasiveness between the races. Elliott Wilson, a young
black man, had never met Wimsatt, but their lives had traced
similar trajectories across the hip-hop landscape. By N.R.

example, and shortly after the series ended, it introduced a lineup

it. They included a black woman and a white woman as well as
Chancellor, who is black, and Dyer, who is white. The paper, it
seemed, had become a proud model of racial enlightenment. Which

DINNER FOR 4 AT DUCASSE AND A $1,500 BILL TO PROVE IT 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The signing of the check at Alain Ducasse is a
special moment. No matter how lively the chatter at the table has
been, a hush descends, and tense faces regard the slick, itemized
printout in their midst with unfeigned awe. With exquisite timing,
a waiter appears and holds up a velvet display board containing a
dozen finely made pens. It's hard not to feel that you are about to
sign a document imposing humiliating terms of surrender. It's a
measure of the delicacy at Ducasse that you are allowed to do it in
high style.
</P>
<P>
   With the arrival of Alain Ducasse at the Essex House, a new era
in New York dining has begun. It is far too early to draw any
conclusions about the food. But the style, the rituals and the
price structure are already in place. Dining at Ducasse is like
learning to eat all over again. New Yorkers are falling all over
themselves to take lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing gets New York's blood up like the challenge of an
unattainable reservation. It's like a dripping hunk of red meat
hung just out of reach of a pack of howling dogs. That's exactly
what Ducasse offered when he announced, some months ago, that he
and his eight-star Michelin reputation would be taking up residence
in the Essex House, in the dining rooms of what used to be Les
Celebrites. Getting in would be half the challenge. The restaurant
seats 65, and there would be one seating a night. Lunch would be
offered twice a week. The restaurant would be closed on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   The second half of the challenge would be the bill. In a bold
see-you, raise-you move, Ducasse declared that his prix-fixe would
cost $160, far more than even the most expensive four-star
Manhattan restaurants. As it turned out, the a la carte menu also
scaled new heights. Appetizers reached the thrilling $50 level.
Entrees toyed with $75, then mincingly retreated to $74. The
message was clear: if you wanted to dine at Ducasse, money would be
no object. But then, it would be a meal cooked by the world's most
celebrated chef.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Ducasse understood a thing or two about marketing. The
moment the phone and fax lines at Ducasse were plugged in, the rush
was on. Within days, the waiting list for a table was reported to
be 2,700 names long. Faithful patrons of Ducasse's restaurants in
Europe have first call on the tables. At the moment, the restaurant
is not taking reservations. Tables are booked through October, and
November reservations cannot be made until Aug. 1. Anyone lucky
enough to secure a reservation must leave a credit-card deposit of
$150 a person.
</P>
<P>
   Die-hard foodies were staring straight into the abyss. Like
everyone else, I was on the outside looking in. In order to remain
anonymous, I have to make reservations in the guise of an ordinary
diner (and sign the bill with a pseudonym as well). But ordinary
diners, at the moment, have less than a snowball's chance of
landing a table at Ducasse.
</P>
<P>
   After I'd spent a week scratching my head over the problem and
making no progress, fate intervened. An acquaintance who had
finagled a table by posing as a longtime Ducasse patron decided
that his credit card might not be up to the near-decathlon trial of
strength that it would face at the restaurant. Would I care to step
into the breach?
</P>
<P>
   You bet.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is an account of My Dinner With Alain. It is not a
review. The New York Times would never review a restaurant open
only two weeks, and after only one visit. In fact, given the
difficulties of landing a reservation, it's anyone's guess when a
review might materialize. One visit took some scheming. Repeating
the feat four or five times will require cunning, extraordinary
luck or Zenlike patience.
</P>
<P>
   But like Howard Carter after penetrating the tomb of
Tutankhamen, I feel compelled to offer the world a glimpse of the
splendors I have witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   Les Celebrites was an elegant room, and after a $2 million
renovation, so is Ducasse. The main dining room, now outfitted with
back-to-back circular booths and well-spaced tables, has a
luxurious feel, with Brazilian rosewood walls and silk upholstery
whose wavy motif suggests rippling water. Throw pillows in the
booths add a sybaritic touch. In a direct assault on Manhattan
manners, waiters propose that the women let loose their purses and
rest them on silk-wrapped cubes thoughtfully placed at table side.
</P>
<P>
   The Celebrites paintings by Elke Sommer and Phyllis Diller have
disappeared, to be replaced by some appalling works by the
cosmically awful Arman. On this occasion, he has glued trumpets,
French horns and other brass instruments to brown linen canvas and
dripped thick, waxy strands of color over them. They make a very
odd partner to a series of large black-and-white landscape
photographs. I did not penetrate the secret recesses of the Salon
de Soie, a private dining room that seats 12, or eat at the
200-year-old oak chef's table in the kitchen. Perhaps later.
</P>
<P>
   Ducasse makes every effort to assure diners that they are
getting special treatment. The special-effects parade begins with
mineral water, offered in a stainless steel carrier pack that holds
a half-dozen varieties. To read the wine list, a tall foldout card
with five panels, requires breaking a wax seal. When diners leave
the table, their entree is transferred to a warming cart. At the
end of the meal, a cart bearing pots of growing herbs makes the
rounds. The diner who desires a verbena tea gets to watch a waiter
grasp the plant in a white-gloved hand and then snip a few leaves
with a pair of silver scissors. As a postscript to the desserts, a
happy trolley comes rolling over, laden with lollipops, madeleines,
jellied fruits, financiers and large apothecary jars filled with
nougats and caramels.
</P>
<P>
   The recipients of this largesse take it as their due. At the
moment, the crowd at Ducasse seems to be made up of world travelers
used to feasting at Ducasse's top restaurants. There is none of the
self-conscious display and neck-craning that I expected to see.
Diners are not checking one another out. They make a dull group, to
tell the truth _ well-heeled, deliberate feeders who will be
dipping their beaks in vintage Champagne in London or Paris next
week. The New York onslaught, in other words, is still poised. The
scene has not yet materialized.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   My meal began with a plateful of paper-thin discs the size of
poker chips. Our waiter announced them as rye-flour crisps topped
either with Parmesan cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, citrus, or black
pepper. These four taste themes, he explained, would be woven
throughout the meal. That they were limp and greasy did not appear
to be part of the thematic plan.
</P>
<P>
   The four-theme crackers reflected a highly conceptual bias at
Ducasse. Black-and-white photographs on the walls, for example,
express the four elements of earth, air, fire and water. The menu
is florid and cryptic, divided into categories like ``aquatic,''
``land,'' and ``vegetal'' (the Ducasse team is a little shaky on
English). It takes a sharp eye to tease out the dividing line
between appetizers and entrees, especially on the menus that do not
show prices. (Ducasse stays with the traditional French practice of
showing prices only to the host at the table.) I puzzled over the
italic typeface highlighting two dishes. The first was spaghettini
with sauteed vegetables, crushed black truffles, Ligurian olive oil
and basil; the second was lightly breaded veal sweetbreads doused
in roasting juices.
</P>
<P>
   ``These reflect Ducasse's two restaurants, in Paris and Monte
Carlo,'' our waiter explained. The pasta and olive oil suggest the
Italian influences that show up on the Monte Carlo menu. The
sweetbreads allude to the richer, more classical Parisian menu. The
wine list, too, has a rhetorical style, with a high-flying
introductory paragraph in French and English, explaining the
philosophy behind the three main categories: Continental,
Mediterranean and oceanic.
</P>
<P>
   The meal included several highlights, beginning with foie gras
poached in pepper court bouillon, a long, thick slab of almost
comic proportions. I may be wrong, but I remember it as hanging
over the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The veloute of spring peas also made an impression. Poured over
a little heap of pea pods and radish greens, it came with crab
fingers fried to a crisp blond finish and a mysterious silver
implement with medical implications. The gleaming object stumped
our table for at least 10 minutes before someone deduced that it
was a set of pincers for picking up the crab fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Less inspiring was a pink block of wild salmon, served very
simply on tile-shape potatoes, which was sandbagged by a viciously
acidic peppered vinegar reduction. Dishes kept showing up in front
of the wrong diners.
</P>
<P>
   Our sommelier showed a take-charge style. When he saw a bad
choice on the way, he did not hesitate to throw his body in front
of it. ``What do you think about Chateau X,'' I asked, silently
patting myself on the back for an ingenious pick. The sommelier had
an answer. ``No,'' he said. That ended that.
</P>
<P>
   I am happy to get firm opinions firmly expressed. The world has
no room for a wishy-washy sommelier, but I was a little dismayed to
see him steer me immediately toward a $345 Burgundy.
</P>
<P>
   Ducasse boasts a waiter-to-diner ratio of nearly one to one (55
waiters to 65 diners), and you can feel it. The whizzing back and
forth can be dizzying, the crush of carts more impressive than rush
hour on the Van Wyck Expressway.
</P>
<P>
   But the real display of well-oiled teamwork took place in the
brilliantly lighted and lavishly renovated kitchen, on display
through a large square window. I got a good look at the show, all
four hours of it, and it proceeded through distinct phases. At
first, the scene resembled the operating room on ``ER,'' with the
patient's prospects in serious doubt. With time, the mood seemed to
lighten, although it was hard to tell, since never once, in all the
time I observed the kitchen, did a chef ever betray even the hint
of a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end, I watched them all scrubbing their saucepans and
washing down their cutting surfaces. Around midnight, I expected to
see the janitor come in with an electric floor polisher.
</P>
<P>
   Only one actor was missing from the drama, the man who would
have made My Dinner With Alain the stuff of legend. That was Alain
Ducasse himself. No one necessarily expects to see the great chef
at his many restaurants _ he has 11 of them, after all, all over
the planet. It's his little joke to say, from time to time, ``I am
at all my restaurants all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But you might think that less than two weeks into opening the
most expensive restaurant Manhattan has ever seen _ the last
restaurant, Ducasse has said, that will bear his name _ that he
would be nervously pacing the quarterdeck, sniffing sauces and
making sure that each $74 entree came out of the kitchen just so.
But he apparently had other fish to fry, in this case the new Tokyo
branch of Spoon, his Parisian diner. Or maybe he does not want to
hear the screams of anguish when the checks arrive.
</P>
<P>
   I accepted mine with stoic calm. But then again, it wasn't
coming out of my pocket. Taking pen in hand, I affixed my signature
to a bill that totaled nearly $1,500 for four diners, tip not
included. In one Olympic clean-and-jerk motion, I had broken all
previous records by several hundred dollars. I felt the kind of mad
exhilaration that criminals must feel when they've done something
terribly, irrevocably wrong.
</P>
<P>
   As I picked up my complimentary craquelin on the way out,
presented in a shiny royal-blue shopping bag, it occurred to me
that I was back to square one. I had eaten at Ducasse. Fine. Now,
how would I get back in? And would I ever lay eyes on Ducasse? &QL;

COMMENTARY: BUILDING GLASS HOUSES 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL KRUGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Monday, when JDS Uniphase and SDL announced their plans for a
merger _ at $41 billion, the largest technology merger so far _ my
reaction was the same as that of most other people: ``Who? What?''
After a bit of reading established that JDS is based in Ottawa, I
supplemented that initial reaction with a hearty ``Eh?'' What ever
happened to companies whose names are recognizable, or at least
give some hint about what business they are in?
</P>
<P>
   But the mysterious obscurity of the companies and
uninformativeness of their names are part of why this story is
important. Most of the real ``new economy'' consists not of
household names with easily understood businesses _ like Amazon.com
_ but of less familiar companies doing mind-numbingly technical
things. And the JDS-SDL merger is a reminder that while the
dot-coms may have had their day, the era of the new economy is by
no means over.
</P>
<P>
   JDS and SDL are in the business of fiber-optics _ the use of
light, rather than electrons, to carry information. To transmit a
short, old-fashioned piece of plain text, like this article, copper
wire will do; to transmit a concert video of the latest teen-age
pop star, or whatever it is that tomorrow's Web consumers will
demand, glass conduits for light waves are what you need. If you,
too, have been mystified by those Qwest ads _ the grungy motel with
the comprehensive movie selection, and so on _ now you know what
they are about (though I remain puzzled about how my willingness to
``ride the light'' will help Qwest's bottom line).
</P>
<P>
   Fiber-optics isn't a high-profile business _ much of its product
is literally underground _ but it nonetheless shares five features
with more glamorous high-tech industries:
</P>
<P>
   Globalization: OK, residents of the United States have a hard
time thinking of Canadians as foreigners, or indeed thinking about
them at all. But this is another small step toward the dissolution
of the nation-state as a meaningful economic unit.
</P>
<P>
   The network economy: In a literal sense, of course, JDS and SDL
are selling the stuff of which the network itself is built. But in
a broader sense they are also beneficiaries of ``network
externalities,'' the way the Web creates demand for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Market exuberance: As the dot-com bubble deflates, we are
starting to hear mutters about an old-fashioned item called
``cash.'' But that word is not being heard much in the fiber-optics
sector. True, JDS and SDL aren't Boo.com or Toy-smart.com; they
have real products and earn real profits. But their stock prices
are nonetheless extraordinary, hundreds of times earnings. And JDS,
following in the footsteps of other tech companies, has in effect
used the high value investors place on its stock as the basis for a
series of acquisitions _ an empire built on expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Neophilia: One slightly peculiar feature of the current business
environment, which I discussed a few columns back, is the positive
preference of the market for companies without a past, or a
low-tech business on the side. This neophilia appears to have
played some role in the JDS-SDL story: the rival fiber-optics
company Corning was also interested in SDL, but was unable or
unwilling to match the JDS offer because Corning stock sells at
more modest multiples of revenue and earnings. There may be sound
business reasons for the difference, but Corning reportedly feels
that the market still values it a bit like a cookware manufacturer,
and is considering spinning its fiber-optics off as a separate
business.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust dilemmas: Even high-tech companies are not supposed to
engage in old-fashioned monopolization; and last year a report on
the industry by the technology magazine Red Herring declared that
``three vendors _ JDS Uniphase, SDL, and E-Tek _ own their market
now and for the foreseeable future.'' When you realize that JDS
acquired E-Tek at the end of last month, you start to wonder. But
on the other hand, JDS and SDL are both genuinely innovative
companies; and temporary monopoly power is justified if it is the
reward for innovation.
</P>
<P>
   It's a judgment call; but if you ask me, the regulators should
leave JDS/SDL alone. (On the other hand, I've said that about
Microsoft too.) It's a brave new world that has such mergers in it;
and we should give that new world a chance to evolve before we
start to place it under too many old-economy strictures.

 ART ADV: With three photos, of Tom Williams (NNS1), Jacob Leverich
(NNS2) and Jackson Pace (NNS3). 
 By JIM NESBITT  
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he catalogs the ups and downs of going to work for Apple
Computer at age 14, several elements are missing from Tom Williams'
unflinching, self-critical rap:
</P>
<P>
   Finger-pointing. Blame. Limp surrender to the Fates or
impersonal forces beyond his control, be they The Man, The System
or The Economy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the former wunderkind exhibits a headlong acceptance of
personal responsibility, a steadfast refusal to play the victim and
a firm acknowledgment that his own decisions -- good or bad -- have
given him the life he leads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't stand people who play victim,'' said Williams, now 21
and living in Los Angeles where he screens technological projects
for a venture capital firm. ``None of this was anybody's choice but
mine. No matter how impressionable or naive I have been, it has
always been my decision.''
</P>
<P>
   For Jacob Leverich, 18, a freshly minted high school graduate
who holds down a sophisticated job at a high-end computer graphics
company, pragmatic faith in self is a mantra.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't allow someone to be responsible for my success; I
can't allow someone to protect me from failure,'' said Leverich,
who is headed to the University of Texas this fall. ``If I fail,
it's my responsibility to get back up and back in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Riding the wave of technological innovation and economic
expansion is a back-to-the-future ethic that emphasizes individual
initiative and accountability, expressed with the hipness and
attitude of youth.
</P>
<P>
   In a land where Jerry Springer is a minor deity and the culture
of complaint, alibi and blame is so strong that a conservative
commentator once dubbed us a Nation of Victims, such unadulterated
blasts of personal responsibility are bracingly refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving in the direction of putting a greater emphasis on
personal responsibility rather than blaming fate or the social
structure,'' said Ted Goertzel, a sociology professor at the
Camden, N.J., campus of Rutgers University. ``There's been a shift
in societal attitude away from blaming the system and looking for
blame in the individual. It's moving in a direction back toward a
more positive view of what you can do rather than complaining about
how the system is broke and what you can't do.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend is particularly pronounced among the age groups
represented by Leverich and Williams, experts say. And this
provides sharp generational contrast with the graying Baby Boomers
just ahead of them on the march through life.
</P>
<P>
   Self-reliance is the common thread between kids like Leverich,
at the leading edge of what some sociologists call the Millennium
Generation, and young adults like Williams, who is at the tail end
of Generation X. Experts note that Xers manifest this
cross-generational trait with a decided cynicism and sense of
isolation, while Millennials are more optimistic and more likely to
band together.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, though, that this is vague and mushy sociological
stuff, lacking the absolutes of atomic physics. Generation X is an
exceedingly broad monicker for anyone born after the Baby Boom and
before the Class of 2000 just now leaving high school.
</P>
<P>
   But polls back the notion of generational differences in outlook
about responsibility, self-reliance and the power of individual
effort.
</P>
<P>
   A July 1999 Pew Research Center survey shows that a
significantly higher share of those between ages 18 and 29 --
almost 79 percent -- believe individual effort is the key to
success. In contrast, only 71 percent of those between 30 and 49
believe this.
</P>
<P>
   The same survey shows the younger age group also has the
strongest belief in the power of the individual: 84 percent of
those 18 to 29 think everyone has the inner strength to succeed in
life; only 77 percent of those between the ages of 50 and 64 and 70
percent of those age 65 and older believe this.
</P>
<P>
   Xers and Millennials are also linked by matter-of-fact low
expectations about politics, government, corporations and other
traditional social institutions, the pros say.
</P>
<P>
   To the degree that they look to others for support or
commitment, it's to a loose collective of friends, family or
like-minded peers, or non-traditional organizations like
non-profits.
</P>
<P>
   They believe in action over words, movement toward a goal rather
than discussion of an idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at it this way -- if the motto of Generation X is `Just
Do It,' then the motto of the Millennials is `Let's Do It,' while
the motto of the Baby Boomers is `Let's Meditate About It,''' said
Neil Howe, co-author of ``Generations: The History of America's
Future.''
</P>
<P>
   In a series of books with co-author William Strauss, Howe argues
that American history has been strongly influenced by a cycle of
generational traits ranging from idealism to alienation.
</P>
<P>
   Boomers were idealistic until Vietnam, Nixon, the assassinations
of the Kennedy brothers and Martin Luther King Jr. and the economic
upheaval of the '70s and '80s made them disillusioned and
inward-looking, Howe said.
</P>
<P>
   Xers are alienated and isolated, taking as a given the empty
promise of traditional societal institutions like family and
government, arming themselves with the cynical belief that they're
on their own. Howe said the most motivated of this generation turn
lone-wolf cynicism into individual action that has positioned them
to take advantage of the current economic expansion; those who
don't are slackers, missing out on the boom's big ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very libertarian generation,'' Howe said of the
Xers. ``They believe you take care of yourself, that you rely on
yourself and your platoon, your surrogate family. ... The take was:
Life can be cruel, you have to deal with it on your own.''
</P>
<P>
   Still a work in progress, the Millennials are just emerging from
high school. They exhibit the most optimism about the future, a
by-product of growing up in nothing-but-good economic times, in an
era of renewed emphasis on protecting kids from the ravages of
broken homes and other societal forces.
</P>
<P>
   Howe said Millenials are just as cynical about traditional
institutions and can be just as alienated as Xers, but he also
notes a mighty cross-current -- willingness to join cooperative
efforts that aren't self-centered, and belief that they can rise
above the challenges of the future.
</P>
<P>
   If that combination persists, it's Howe's belief that the
Millenials will take on the mantle of the World War II generation
and their unstinting belief in duty, honor and country.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this rings true to Jackson Pace. The teacher and
technology coordinator at Lyndon Baines Johnson High School in
Austin, Texas, works closely with the teen computer wizards in the
school's special science and technology program, including Jacob
Leverich.
</P>
<P>
   The Millennials in his program are technologically savvy,
confident that their computer skills are a bankable backstop for
the future. They're unburdened by the baggage carried by boomers --
such as the need to be in touch with every emotion, or the
financial worries ingrained by the economies of the '70s and '80s
and the Great Depression stories passed down by parents and
grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no overriding fear that they can't whip it, they can't
overcome it,'' Pace, 43, said of his students. ``These kids have a
full toolbelt of skills. They analyze quicker, they assess need
quicker, they pull the tool, get it done and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Pace, a Baby Boomer, contrasts this with his own approach to
issues: ``I have to know that it's OK, know that you think it's OK,
and I want to talk to you about it being OK. We'll justify our
point and then do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids process it and get it done with no talk.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Pace thinks the Millennials have a decided advantage over Xers
-- a willingness to cooperate with each other, a sense of something
larger than themselves and a fearlessness born from prosperity and
comfort with technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Xers knew the only reason they were in this world was
because that yuppie parent had money and they were another
possession,'' said Pace. ``And that created a real cynical kid. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's kids really are bubbling up in the last
quarter-century as renaissance kids. They're not money grubbers.
They know they can get the money. And I'm not sure they're basing
their human happiness on cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Leverich echoes this last point: ``What will make me happy is
not necessarily making more money. What will make me happy is to
set myself apart and not just be another person off the assembly
line.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Technology is the key to this confident self-reliance, said Mary
Ann Rafoth, professor of educational psychology at Indiana
University of Pennsylvania. Computer competence gives adolescents
and young adults a taste of success at a crucial stage of life, a
boost they are likely to ride into middle age.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see technology as a big part of the future and they're
comfortable with it,'' Rafoth said. ``They tend to be
individualistic and see themselves in control and not the pawns of
giant, impersonal forces. That's because they haven't lived through
a Vietnam or World War II. They see it as getting what they want
out of life and nothing stopping them and technology enabling to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The flip side of this confidence is an uninformed arrogance, an
unwillingness to acknowlege the value of life experiences outside
the narrow band of technological competence. It is the thing that
drives boomers to crazed distraction when they confront Xers and
Millennials.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may be more sophisticated and more knowlegeable about one
thing -- technology -- and because of that they won't give you
credit for the things you've lived through,'' Rafoth said.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Howe, who runs management seminars, says fixation on technology
exacerbates the biggest cultural clash in the modern workplace --
the conflict between boomer-era managers and Xers who discount what
their elders have lived through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boomers are into mission statements and corporate culture and
creating a sense of community and team play,'' said Howe. ``Xers
are much more contractual about work. `If it's 5 o'clock, I'm outta
here.' They say they bring to the job all they need to bring. They
don't bring all the baggage and expectations that boomers bring.''
</P>
<P>
   Millennials share this transactional attitude about work, but
sport it with less of a nasty edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of being the enemy of these corporations, it's just
where we go to work,'' said Leverich. ``I don't see them as my
enemy, but I don't see them as my savior, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who sometimes sounds like a world-weary boomer instead
of the tail-end Xer he is, buys the notion that his generation
believes in self- determination. But he doesn't see this as
something noble. Deserted by divorcing parents and discredited
social institutions, Xers had no choice but to rely on their own
devices, he says.
</P>
<P>
   And he doesn't see his generation or the Millennials as any less
self- absorbed than the boomers. As proof he cites the resiliance
of conspicuous consumption, wide reliance on the anti-depressant
Prozac and the popularity of the public self-confessional.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he wryly notes the grit and high-tech gumption of his
peers and the next generation down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was Steven Spielberg,'' he jokes. ``All of his
movies, which we all grew up on, feature kids overcoming problems
and saving the adults. We've grown up with this very surreptitious,
but very strong can-do attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``The limitation of my father's generation and his father's
generation was to never dare something beyond your station in life.
Today, those self-imposed mental barriers are no longer there. You
can do almost anything and accomplish almost anything you set out
to accomplish.''

 ART ADV: With photo of shark cartilage (NNS4). 
 By ROBERT COHEN

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Andrew J. Lane has long believed a cure for cancer
may be swimming around the warm waters of the South Pacific in the
cartilage of man-eating sharks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Lane's unorthodox views have caught the full attention of
the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, authorities have sought to ban Lane from
selling his shark cartilage supplement and fined him $1 million for
deceptively marketing his product as a cure for cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But they've also agreed to fund a multimillion-dollar National
Cancer Institute study to see whether his claims have scientific
merit.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, president of Lane Labs USA in Allendale, N.J., said he
finds himself in a crossfire between the natural dietary supplement
law that allows nontraditional products to be sold over the counter
without federal approval, and the separate law governing
pharmaceuticals that requires rigorous scientific data and Food and
Drug Administration certification.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real dilemma for us,'' Lane said. ``We are a company
that focuses on natural supplements, but we test them like
pharmaceutical companies test medicines, and maybe the problem the
FDA has with us is they don't know where to place us on the
matrix.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission counter that Lane's
predicament is of his own making.
</P>
<P>
   In separate complaints, they have charged Lane with stepping
over the legal boundaries by touting unproved cancer claims about
his shark cartilage supplement and marketing his product as if it
were a drug without the necessary clinical studies and approvals.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't promote something as a drug and then turn around and
say it is a dietary supplement,'' said FDA spokesman Brad Stone.
``Once you make drug claims, in our view, that renders it as an
unapproved drug.''
</P>
<P>
   Although shark cartilage products are used in the United States
by more than 50,000 people for medical conditions such as cancer,
the NCI -- now sponsoring two shark cartilage clinical trials,
including the one on Lane's product -- said there are no
authoritative studies showing this substance helps cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
   In the studies so far, ``The response rate to cartilage therapy
for these (cancer) patients has not been impressive,'' an NCI
report said.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA, in its federal lawsuit filed in Newark, N.J., in
December, asked for an order banning Lane Labs from selling three
products. These were BeneFin, which is made from shark cartilage
and promoted as a cancer treatment; SkinAnswer, a topical skin
cream sold as a cancer treatment; and MGN-3, a rice bran extract
sold to treat cancer and HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Lane said his company will fight the charges and not bow to what
he called a government ``intimidation process.'' Lane Labs sells
270 caplets of BeneFin for $78.26.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the FTC settled its own lawsuit against Lane
Labs and Cartilage Consultants of Short Hills, N.J., a firm run by
Lane's father, I. William Lane. The FTC charged the two companies
with deceptive marketing and advertising of BeneFin and SkinAnswer
through the Internet and other means by making false claims that
the products were ``clinically proven'' to treat or cure cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement includes a $1 million fine, with Lane Labs paying
$550,000 to reimburse consumers and using the other $450,000 to
help pay for part of its share of the already approved NCI trial of
the BeneFin shark product that will be conducted by researchers at
the Mayo Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey White, director of the Office of Cancer Complementary
and Alternative Medicine at NCI, said Lane's legal trouble is ``not
a welcome situation.''
</P>
<P>
   White said the NCI chose Lane's BeneFin and another shark
cartilage substance produced by Aeterna Laboratories in Canada as
part of its broad congressional mandate to look at alternative
therapies.
</P>
<P>
   He said the government-sponsored Phase 3 clinical studies do not
represent an endorsement or mean there will be positive results.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are trying to do is develop a database about these
products, and it could well be that this data will be negative,''
White said. ``The mere fact we are studying it doesn't imply there
will be a good chance of success.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of shark cartilage as a cancer treatment was popularized
in 1993 by I. William Lane. The elder Lane, an agricultural
biochemist, wrote a book titled ``Sharks Don't Get Cancer'' and a
1996 revision titled ``Sharks Still Don't Get Cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   The first book, the subject of a ``60 Minutes'' broadcast in
1993, described positive results from shark cartilage treatments.
It was followed by aggressive marketing of the shark cartilage
supplement by Lane's son.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-cancer theory behind shark cartilage is that it has
properties that block the growth of the tiny blood vessels that
feed tumors.
</P>
<P>
   But the most recent study, conducted by the independent Cancer
Treatment Research Foundation, tested shark cartilage powder on
advanced-stage cancer patients and found it neither slowed their
disease nor improved their quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   In April, scientists reported at the annual meeting of the
American Association of Cancer Research that sharks do get cancer,
contrary to the title of Lane's books.
</P>
<P>
   Both Lanes say they knew this all along, but the publisher of
the book wanted a bold title. They have said this fact does not
detract from their belief that shark cartilage has anti-cancer
properties.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   John Harshbarger, director of the Registry of Tumors in Lower
Animals at George Washington University, said he and an associate
found 40 examples of tumors, about half in sharks and the remaining
in skates, rays and other shark relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``These shark cartilage products have been promoted by the books
that say sharks don't get cancer, and sharks still don't get
cancer. We have examples that sharks do get cancer,'' Harshbarger
said. ``These books are misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Simone of Lawrenceville, N.J., an oncologist who
concluded an FDA-approved clinical cancer study a year ago on 30
patients using shark cartilage powder, is also a skeptic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is enough out there to say it probably doesn't work,''
Simone said. ``I saw no way to benefit cancer patients at all. This
is not the way to go. We have to look at something else.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   We all have our embarrassing little secrets. Mine is that I read
children's books.
</P>
<P>
   I started when I was a small boy, raiding our tiny elementary
school library for such kinder classics as Roy Chapman Andrew's
(beginitalic)All About Dinosaurs, (enditalic)and have continued to
this day.
</P>
<P>
   It was never the fictional or fairy tale books I latched onto
but the histories, biographies, science and natural history books.
Herbert S. Zim was my god.
</P>
<P>
   The books were filled with the answers to the questions I had
when I was in third grade. Why do some whales have teeth and others
baleen? How does an airplane stay in the air? Why is an egg shaped
that way?
</P>
<P>
   I still have questions, and books still provide answers. Or when
they don't give me answers, they show me the path to find my own
answer.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes jumping straight into a serious adult tome is
confusing. The experts who write them know much more than I do. And
they don't care about my ignorance. As a result, they can write
well beyond my poor ability to understand them on first go-round.
They are either written with the assumption that you already have
the rudiments, or they are polemical and assume you know the
disputed territory, or they are specialist books filled with a new
vocabulary you haven't learned yet.
</P>
<P>
   That's where children's books come in.
</P>
<P>
   Children's books give you the simplified, coherent version that
the adult books won't deign to provide.
</P>
<P>
   I am aware that the version the children's book gives is often
distorted, grotesquely simplified and sometimes just plain wrong.
But that doesn't matter: They provide a start, a map to the subject
at hand and give you an orientation that can later be fleshed out,
made more subtle and transcended. But you have to begin somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to realize that knowledge is not merely a
collection of facts. We are bombarded with facts daily, and it
hasn't made any of us smarter. It just means we have more to
forget. And we do.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledge is a set of interrelationships between facts. The
interrelationship has a shape and coherence that cannot be
constructed from the facts alone.
</P>
<P>
   I am reminded over and over about Einstein and facts. ``If I
need a fact, I can look it up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   You can understand information by two different metaphors. I
choose what I call the ``tree of knowledge.'' It has roots and
branches and creates a unified, simple idea. There may be many
leaves on the tree, but if you keep the shape of the tree in mind,
the leaves - the facts - will turn out to be just where they need
to be.
</P>
<P>
   The other metaphor - the one we come across daily in TV
newscasts, magazine articles and written driving exams - is what I
call ``fact confetti.'' This is the blizzard of unconnected data
that piles up across our road. Get me a snowplow.
</P>
<P>
   If you think of history as a bunch of dates and names - 1588,
1492, June 6, A.D.79 - it's no wonder you have trouble remembering
it. But if you know the great flow, the big picture, all the
details make sense where they come.
</P>
<P>
   They are more than merely dates associated with the Spanish
Armada, the expulsion of Jews from Spain, D-Day or the destruction
of Pompeii, they are part of the inevitable flow of history.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a systemic view of anatomy, no bone will be
unconnected to its neighbor. If you know the division between
bivalves and univalves, the shells you find at the beach have an
instant home - a kind of mailbox in your brain - where they belong
and fit comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   I often have found that if I have forgotten a fact, I can
re-create it accurately by knowing its context. It is better to
know how the French Revolution fits into the change from the Age of
Enlightenment to the Age of Romanticism. If you feel the larger
flow, then you remember that the French Revolution (beginitalic)has
(enditalic)to come after the American one.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, once you have created enough of these ``trees of
knowledge'' on a large number of subjects, then you start seeing
the forest instead of the trees, and it becomes easier and easier
to fit a new shrub into the even larger system. All with almost
none of the pain of trying to learn facts by rote.
</P>
<P>
   Children's books give you a sense of the flow and very few
facts. If later you discover that the tree of knowledge you gained
from the kid's book is flawed, you can trim it or replant it, but
it has served its purpose. It has got you in the door.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you never get beyond a children's book, well, you still
know more than most people.

<TEXT>
<P>
   I dug into my first real French steak, pan-seared, at a noisy,
smoke-filled brasserie near Pigalle about 20 years ago. It was
onglet, and I was immediately struck by its ropy, not-too-tender
but not-too-tough texture and its strong, almost kidneyish flavor.
This was not your generic slab of sirloin or rib-eye or pallid
filet mignon. This was a cut of meat I'd never seen before.
Strange, exciting, even a little scary. This, I thought, was
eating.
</P>
<P>
   Today onglet is better known as hanger steak in New York, and it
is so common it turns up in restaurants beyond French brasseries,
and even in some meat markets. But the French steaks served
alongside the frites can still be a mystery to most Americans, and
it's not the meat but the cut that mystifies. These aren't simple
sirloins or porterhouses or T-bones, and the differences are not
just a matter of translation. For all their flavor, these steaks
demand more of butcher and buyer alike.
</P>
<P>
   What's good _ what's great _ about French cuisine stems from its
guiding principles, and no principle is more firmly ingrained in
the minds and souls of French-trained chefs than the idea that one
must ``use everything.'' Use what's available. Use it to its best
effect. And make the most money you can from it _ every scrap of
shank, shoulder and jowl.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the early days, when the meat supply was often erratic
and refrigeration was at a minimum, frugal butchers had to make
some shrewd moves to make a profit off a side of beef. They worked
hard, often with the precision of desperate and money-hungry
neurologists, rooting around with their knives, searching for gold
deep inside the less-prized and less-expensive sections of carcass.
</P>
<P>
   At Les Halles in New York, where I'm the chef, I have the luxury
of working with Hubert Marie, a traditionally trained French
butcher. He knows where and how to dig for this stuff, and he's
initiated me into the arcane pleasures of French-cut beef.
</P>
<P>
   The French, though they age every other thing they eat _ game,
cheese, wine, their whole country a wonderland of noble rot _ do
not, inexplicably, age their beef much: Only three to five days, as
opposed to the three to five weeks favored by Americans.
</P>
<P>
   French cattle are fed mostly on grass and, unlike their
grain-fed counterparts in the United States, are often bred to
produce both milk and meat. And not to be unkind but, with the
notable exception of Charolais beef, the French meat is generally
tougher, less marbled with fat, and less tasty when finally cut up,
cooked and dropped in portions onto a dinner plate. I get the best
of both worlds: Plump, well-marbled Black Angus beef from the
American heartland, and the knife skills and enterprising mind of a
French butcher.
</P>
<P>
   After the most expensive cuts _ tenderloin (filet de boeuf), rib
steaks (entrecotes) and sirloin (faux filet) _ were gone, sold to
their wealthier customers, French butchers found other
more-difficult-to-remove pieces: Small, frequently single-portion
cuts with mysterious names like la poire (the pear) and la
fausse-araignee (the spider).
</P>
<P>
   Of these odd cuts, there are a few actually available to
Americans: Paleron, a piece of shoulder clod, most often used for
braising, though it yields excellent steaks for searing and
grilling; pave, or filet de romsteck, a sort of poor man's filet
mignon; the awesome onglet; and the bavette d'aloyau, the more
tender little brother of flank steak.
</P>
<P>
   A regular customer unhappy about not being able to afford the
aristocratic (but relatively flavorless) delights of filet mignon
could comfort herself with the knowledge that the hand-size flap of
leg or shoulder, which the butcher ceremoniously wrapped in brown
paper, was often the only such cut on the entire side of beef: A
rare, much-sought-after treat that would, once spirited back home,
be unavailable to that nasty Madame Dupont next door.
</P>
<P>
   Onglet was for years known in America as the butcher's
tenderloin, a single-strip piece of gamy, unattractive beef
situated between the kidneys. Unprotected by bone or fat it quickly
became dark and unsalable to American customers for whom all steak
was rosy sirloin or T-bone, so the butcher would keep that piece
for himself. For the French, though, this cut was a rare pleasure _
because of its exposed location, it comes in contact with the air
and begins aging almost immediately after the animal is
slaughtered, and so it is more flavorful.
</P>
<P>
   The industrious Hubert is a master at work on a romsteck _
called a top butt in America. For steak frites, he cuts and slices
the thin, chewy, powerful-tasting leg meat that stands up so well
to the freshly cracked black pepper I adore. For London broil, he
doesn't just whack the big hump of beef straight across _ fat,
connective tissue, nerve and all _ as his American comrades do; he
seams and cuts, removing the outer flap, a piece that yields a few
steaks and some grinding meat. Then he cuts away all the fat and
connective tissue from the large coeur de romsteck, which is also
used for steak frites, and then skillfully cuts to the heart of the
matter: The elusive filet de romsteck, a cylindrical column of beef
about a foot long, a tasty, fairly tender and completely trimmed
hunk that resembles filet mignon. It's typically cut like a filet
and called pave, and used for steak au poivre.
</P>
<P>
   Those old-school French guys worked hard at the butcher block
and came up with simple, delicious ways to cook some of these
hard-won cuts _ again, using what was cheap, what was leftover,
what was around.
</P>
<P>
   My boss, who hails from the Bordeaux region, gets misty-eyed
when he talks about grilling onglet ``en sarment'' _ over dried
grapevine twigs. Next time you take one of those vineyard tours on
Long Island, maybe you can ask for some of their trash. (Just make
sure to scoop up a lot of the dried vines, or you'll end up buying
them in sexy little ribbon-tied bundles at some gourmet shop for 20
bucks a clip.)
</P>
<P>
   Onglet a l'echalote inspires similar wistful reverie among my
French cronies and co-workers: Simply grill a piece of seasoned
hanger steak (this preparation is good for flank steak too, though
really good if you can get a French butcher to cut you a bavette
d'aloyau), remove it from the flame just short of desired doneness,
and while it's still sizzling hot, cover one side with chopped or
finely diced shallots and let it sit for five minutes. The meat
will rest _ which is always a good idea _ and the raw shallots will
sweat slightly, kind of but not really cooking on the hot beef.
</P>
<P>
   Eat with plenty of vin ordinaire _ and of course, frites. (If
you can get some kidney fat off your butcher to fry those spuds,
you are really living the good life.)
</P>
<P>
   Pave, the filet de romsteck, is a cut that one of the few French
butchers in town might actually be able to sell you now and again _
especially if you call ahead. And again, the more humble pieces of
leg and shoulder work particularly well with pepper: Just dredge in
cracked peppercorns, sear in a hot, oiled saute pan to desired
doneness (the thick pave can be finished in the oven if necessary),
pour off excess grease and oil from the pan and deglaze with a
tablespoon or two of brandy. Do not flame _ no matter how much fun
it is.
</P>
<P>
   As the brandy reduces, and all that good stuff releases from the
pan, add a few ounces of demiglace (you can buy it frozen if you
must), a pinch more of crushed black pepper, some sea salt, and
reduce a little more. At the very end, gently swirl in a
heart-clogging hunk of butter until the sauce becomes a creamy
emulsion. Pour over the steak and serve with frites (of course),
maybe a little salad of local greens, and a thick chunk of country
bread.
</P>
<P>
   At Les Halles, we serve a red wine shallot sauce with our
onglet. Slowly saute two chopped shallots in a little oil until
they look clear. Add about half a cup of red wine and reduce by
about two-thirds, then add about a cup of demiglace, a sprig of
fresh thyme and a bay leaf and cook until reduced by half.
</P>
<P>
   When the sauce is fairly thick, opaque and no longer tastes
winy, add a chopped shallot. Simmer a few moments more, then jack
the sauce with a tiny amount of balsamic or good-quality aged red
wine vinegar. Season with black pepper and sea salt and serve,
either poured over the steak or on the side.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of strong-tasting beef and
sweet-and-ever-so-slightly-sour sauce should have you whistling
horrible French pop tunes and reconsidering Jerry Lewis in no time
at all.

THIS. Moving in the ``E'' and ``L'' categories)

 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We all have our embarrassing little secrets. Mine is that I read
children's books.
</P>
<P>
   I started when I was a small boy, raiding our tiny elementary
school library for such kinder classics as Roy Chapman Andrew's
(beginitalic)All About Dinosaurs, (enditalic)and have continued to
this day.
</P>
<P>
   It was never the fictional or fairy tale books I latched onto
but the histories, biographies, science and natural history books.
Herbert S. Zim was my god.
</P>
<P>
   The books were filled with the answers to the questions I had
when I was in third grade. Why do some whales have teeth and others
baleen? How does an airplane stay in the air? Why is an egg shaped
that way?
</P>
<P>
   I still have questions, and books still provide answers. Or when
they don't give me answers, they show me the path to find my own
answer.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes jumping straight into a serious adult tome is
confusing. The experts who write them know much more than I do. And
they don't care about my ignorance. As a result, they can write
well beyond my poor ability to understand them on first go-round.
They are either written with the assumption that you already have
the rudiments, or they are polemical and assume you know the
disputed territory, or they are specialist books filled with a new
vocabulary you haven't learned yet.
</P>
<P>
   That's where children's books come in.
</P>
<P>
   Children's books give you the simplified, coherent version that
the adult books won't deign to provide.
</P>
<P>
   I am aware that the version the children's book gives is often
distorted, grotesquely simplified and sometimes just plain wrong.
But that doesn't matter: They provide a start, a map to the subject
at hand and give you an orientation that can later be fleshed out,
made more subtle and transcended. But you have to begin somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to realize that knowledge is not merely a
collection of facts. We are bombarded with facts daily, and it
hasn't made any of us smarter. It just means we have more to
forget. And we do.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledge is a set of interrelationships between facts. The
interrelationship has a shape and coherence that cannot be
constructed from the facts alone.
</P>
<P>
   I am reminded over and over about Einstein and facts. ``If I
need a fact, I can look it up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   You can understand information by two different metaphors. I
choose what I call the ``tree of knowledge.'' It has roots and
branches and creates a unified, simple idea. There may be many
leaves on the tree, but if you keep the shape of the tree in mind,
the leaves - the facts - will turn out to be just where they need
to be.
</P>
<P>
   The other metaphor - the one we come across daily in TV
newscasts, magazine articles and written driving exams - is what I
call ``fact confetti.'' This is the blizzard of unconnected data
that piles up across our road. Get me a snowplow.
</P>
<P>
   If you think of history as a bunch of dates and names - 1588,
1492, June 6, A.D.79 - it's no wonder you have trouble remembering
it. But if you know the great flow, the big picture, all the
details make sense where they come.
</P>
<P>
   They are more than merely dates associated with the Spanish
Armada, the expulsion of Jews from Spain, D-Day or the destruction
of Pompeii, they are part of the inevitable flow of history.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a systemic view of anatomy, no bone will be
unconnected to its neighbor. If you know the division between
bivalves and univalves, the shells you find at the beach have an
instant home - a kind of mailbox in your brain - where they belong
and fit comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   I often have found that if I have forgotten a fact, I can
re-create it accurately by knowing its context. It is better to
know how the French Revolution fits into the change from the Age of
Enlightenment to the Age of Romanticism. If you feel the larger
flow, then you remember that the French Revolution (beginitalic)has
(enditalic)to come after the American one.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, once you have created enough of these ``trees of
knowledge'' on a large number of subjects, then you start seeing
the forest instead of the trees, and it becomes easier and easier
to fit a new shrub into the even larger system. All with almost
none of the pain of trying to learn facts by rote.
</P>
<P>
   Children's books give you a sense of the flow and very few
facts. If later you discover that the tree of knowledge you gained
from the kid's book is flawed, you can trim it or replant it, but
it has served its purpose. It has got you in the door.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you never get beyond a children's book, well, you still
know more than most people.

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new book:
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim the Boy''
</P>
<P>
   ByTony Earley
</P>
<P>
   (Little, Brown, $23.95)
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to describe a book like this, a small gem that
appears without fanfare and quietly puts other novels to shame.
It's the story of 10-year-old Jim Glass, whose father died a week
before he was born and who has been raised by his mother and her
three unmarried brothers, known collectively to Jim as ``the
uncles.'' They are a makeshift but solid family, working their
North Carolina farm during the years of the Great Depression. The
action, like the book cover, is deceptively simple, involving a new
suitor for Jim's mother, a new friend for Jim at school and a trip
with one of his uncles that opens Jim's eyes to the world beyond
the small town of Aliceville. Earley, who writes beautifully and
yet with studied restraint, creates a tangible world with these
characters and conveys the deep and lasting importance of small
events in a boy's life. As always, the simplest stories are the
most difficult to tell - and this one is a triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mountain City''
</P>
<P>
   By Gregory Martin
</P>
<P>
   (North Point, $21)
</P>
<P>
   Mountain City, Nev., is a mile long, limit to limit. Its
business district consists of seven buildings, including a gas
station and a bar. There are no stoplights or stop signs. Only 33
people live there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come and go,'' writes Martin, ``but when I'm there, that
makes 34.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's family has run the general store in Mountain City since
1958, but their ties to the place go back to their Basque
ancestors, who settled there during the 1800s. Through the drastic
population swings of the boom and bust mining towns, they have hung
on, taking jobs that kept them in the landscape they had come to
love. But life in Mountain City is fading fast. Martin writes this
meticulous memoir as if he hopes to preserve some affectionate but
unsentimental sense of his family and their home before they are
gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me,'' he says, ``home is the place I can't keep from
disappearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, by the end of the book Mountain City's population
is only 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Rant, Therefore I Am''
</P>
<P>
   By Dennis Miller
</P>
<P>
   (Doubleday, $21.95)
</P>
<P>
   Are you ready for some venom? Actually, that word is inadequate
to describe the rancorous, sump-sucking (Miller's term) disdain the
author feels for just about anybody or anything at any given time.
Among his targets: people who watch daytime talk shows (''I swear,
you can still see the jelly on their foreheads where the
electroshock terminals were attached''), the war on drugs (''If we
had any actual commitment, you'd be able to look at a map and see a
smoking hole where Colombia once was'') and the film ``Elizabeth''
(It's about ``some chick who's kind of nice-looking, then she
becomes Queen of England and gets all ugly and bald''). Whatever
will he say about football? These rants are from Miller's TV show,
and judging from sales of his previous collections, you'd think
they're very funny. We think what's hilarious in a monologue falls
flat on a page. Of course. that's just our opinion. We could be
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gig''
</P>
<P>
   Edited by John Bowe, Marisa Bowe and Sabin Streeter
</P>
<P>
   (Crown, $25)
</P>
<P>
   Here are selections from the Working column featured in the Web
magazine ``Word,'' which for several years has sent interviewers
across the country to listen to people talk about their jobs.
Included here are a corporate headhunter, a crime-scene cleaner, a
financial adviser, a bus driver, a McDonald's worker, a buffalo
rancher, a diet center owner, a porn star, a professional
snowboarder, an actress, an FBI agent, a palm reader, a plastic
surgeon, a waitress and many others. A UPS driver admits that he
gives lousy service to customers who don't tip well at Christmas, a
gun store owner says he is ``basically unemployable - I have a
problem with authority figures,'' and a paparazzo describes the day
actor Alec Baldwin punched him and broke his nose for trying to
shoot video of Baldwin bringing home his newborn daughter. The
interviewees, many of whom are remarkably candid, are identified by
their real names.

 &HT;    Jewish group slams Bush over `Jesus Day' proclamation
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Jewish Congress on Tuesday scolded Gov. George W.
Bush for declaring a ``Jesus Day'' in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based organization, which works to maintain the
separation of church and state, called the Bush proclamation an
``egregious example'' of an elected official trying to
``accommodate the religious views'' of constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principal problem with Governor Bush's proclamation is not
that it acknowledges the important civic contributions of a
particular faith, but that it assumes that the profound regard in
which the teachings and person of Jesus Christ are held by the
Christian community are the norm for all residents of the state of
Texas,'' said Phil Baum, executive director of the American Jewish
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush proclamation was issued in conjunction with June 10
``March for Jesus,'' an annual event held in cities around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout the world, people of all religions recognize Jesus
Christ as an example of love, compassion, sacrifice and service,''
Bush said in what was called an ``official memorandum.'' ``Reaching
out to the poor, the suffering and the marginalized, he provided
moral leadership that continues to inspire countless men, women and
children today.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, a Methodist who speaks openly about his religious beliefs,
said at a December debate that Christ was the political or
philosophical hero with whom he most identifies ``because he
changed my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   In the June proclamation, Bush included a call for ``all Texans
to answer the call to serve those in need.
</P>
<P>
   ``By volunteering their time, energy or resources to helping
others, adults and youngsters follow Christ's message of love and
service in thought and deed,'' he said in the proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   Baum said that call is difficult to follow for the state's
``Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, members of other faith groups and
non-believers, all of whom are entitled to equal respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Linda Edwards said the proclamation stemmed
from the governor's belief ``in acknowledging nonprofit
organizations for the good works that they do, without endorsing,
necessarily, all the goals or objectives of those organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush is sensitive to the concerns of the American
Jewish Congress but is also mindful of the longstanding tradition
of governors of both parties to honor individuals or organizations
for their good works,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   She also noted that Bush has issued proclamations honoring a
variety of religions organizations, including Sikh, Baha'I, Hindu
and Jewish houses of worship.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 and 1998, he issued proclamations noting the March for
Jesus and declaring a ``March for Jesus Days'' in each year.
</P>
<P>
   Baum said all proclamations honoring religious organizations
``are offensive and erode the protection afforded minority beliefs
by the constitutional doctrine that we are all better off when
religion and state are kept separate.'' He urged governors to
resist ``sectarian pronouncements.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's Jesus Day proclamation was issued at the request of
Paul and Kathy Sanchez of Lockhart, the Central Texas
representatives of the March for Jesus organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governors of all states make various proclamations of certain
days to commemorate certain segments of their constituencies. Th

 &HT;    CLINTON OPENS CAMP DAVID II URGING PARTIES TO SEEK COMPROMISE
 &HT;    With SUMMIT-TOWN 0712; ISRAEL-GRASSROOTS-0712.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ Setting his sights on securing ``a just and
enduring'' peace in the fractious Middle East, President Clinton
opened high stakes negotiations Tuesday between Israeli and
Palestinian leaders at the secluded presidential retreat where a
dramatic accord was reached two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking off the talks with a stroll through the rolling
woodlands of Camp David, Clinton and his guests _ Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat _ smiled
at reporters and shared light conversation on their way to the
brick-and-clapboard lodge where negotiations began.
</P>
<P>
   In a light-hearted sign of the tensions between them, though,
Barak and Arafat started off with a brief but animated exchange
over who should enter the Laurel lodge first. Each tried to defer
to the other.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Arafat wagged his finger at Barak, tripping off a
bit of mutual backslapping and arm tugging before Barak followed
Arafat through the doorway. Clinton looked on laughing from inside
the lodge, where the three leaders and senior aides met for half an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides shrugged off the diplomatic slapstick.
</P>
<P>
   ``They greeted each other in a very friendly way,'' White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere is good, and the mood is serious,'' Lockhart
said. ``I felt that they were both here on a serious attempt to
make peace.''
</P>
<P>
   As he left the White House for the half-hour helicopter flight
to Camp David _ the secluded presidential retreat in the cool,
green Catoctin Mountains five miles from this western Maryland town
_ Clinton stopped short of predicting success.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he warned that ``profound and wrenching questions,''
must be settled during what promise to be up to a week of grinding
talks centered on a slate of contentious issues at the core of a
half-century of war and enmity between Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues include the question of Palestinian statehood,
borders, the future of Jerusalem and the extent to which
Palestinian refugees may return to former homelands now controlled
by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   As he has stressed in the past, Clinton reiterated that neither
side should expect a clean win on all issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no success without principled compromise,''
Clinton said in his White House departure remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called last week for the talks, saying negotiators for
both sides had reached an impasse that has ground the peace process
to a dangerous stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   Building on that theme, he warned the parties Tuesday against
believing that time was on their side, that either one might
improve their negotiating prospects by stalling or by kicking
painful decisions down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parties have proven that peace is possible when they are
determined to make it,'' Clinton said. ``In the process, they have
passed the point of no return. The only way forward now is
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hopes to tie up in the coming days a marathon diplomatic
undertaking kicked off at Camp David in 1978, when President Jimmy
Carter brokered a breakthrough peace accord between Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement called for Israel and the Palestinians to resolve
their outstanding disputes over the next five years, an objective
Clinton hopes to attain before he leaves July 19 for the annual
Group of Eight summit in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The weight of history fell with a thud here on this 18th-Century
crossroads at the foot of the Catoctin Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The town's 4,400 residents have grown used to seeing
presidential motorcades whiz up and down its otherwise quiet
streets. They've even accepted the inconvenience of having Clinton
take over the Maple Run golf course at the edge of town, once a
dairy farm and source of pancake syrup from the sugar maple trees
that still abound in these parts.
</P>
<P>
   This week, though, the town is inundated with more than 300
members of the international press corps, as well as scores of
high-level White House aides and U.S., Israeli and Palestinian
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Most town folk voiced pessimism about the prospects for a
comprehensive peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, that war's been going on forever ain't it,''
said 24-year-old Jeremy Hahn, who served four years in the Marine

   ``All we're going to do is give 'em more money, they'll go back

</P>
<P>
   Arafat arrived at 1 a.m. ET at Camp David, where he was greeted
by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Barak arrived five
hours later, also welcomed by Albright.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:30 a.m. ET, the president arrived, met briefly with top
Middle East aides, then met for about 40 minutes with Arafat on the
back porch of Clinton's lodge, the Aspen cottage. After Arafat
left, Clinton met for nearly an hour, in the same spot, with Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Strolling in between his Middle East guests along a pathway
through the wooded presidential retreat, Clinton smiled at
reporters but refused to answer questions, in keeping with the news
blackout the parties agreed upon to prevent media leaks from
spoiling the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pledged to each other we would answer no questions and
offer no comment,'' Clinton said. ``I'd like to set a good
example.''

<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ Setting his sights on securing ``a just and
enduring'' peace in the fractious Middle East, President Clinton
opened high stakes negotiations Tuesday between Israeli and
Palestinian leaders at the secluded presidential retreat where a
dramatic accord was reached two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking off the talks with a stroll through the rolling
woodlands of Camp David, Clinton and his guests _ Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat _ smiled
at reporters and shared light conversation on their way to the
brick-and-clapboard lodge where negotiations began.
</P>
<P>
   In a light-hearted sign of the tensions between them, though,
Barak and Arafat started off with a brief but animated exchange
over who should enter the Laurel lodge first. Each tried to defer
to the other.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Arafat wagged his finger at Barak, tripping off a
bit of mutual backslapping and arm tugging before Barak followed
Arafat through the doorway. Clinton looked on laughing from inside
the lodge, where the three leaders and senior aides met for half an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides shrugged off the diplomatic slapstick.
</P>
<P>
   ``They greeted each other in a very friendly way,'' White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere is good, and the mood is serious,'' Lockhart
said. ``I felt that they were both here on a serious attempt to
make peace.''
</P>
<P>
   As he left the White House for the half-hour helicopter flight
to Camp David _ the secluded presidential retreat in the cool,
green Catoctin Mountains five miles from this western Maryland town
_ Clinton stopped short of predicting success.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he warned that ``profound and wrenching questions,''
must be settled during what promise to be up to a week of grinding
talks centered on a slate of contentious issues at the core of a
half-century of war and enmity between Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues include the question of Palestinian statehood,
borders, the future of Jerusalem and the extent to which
Palestinian refugees may return to former homelands now controlled
by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   As he has stressed in the past, Clinton reiterated that neither
side should expect a clean win on all issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no success without principled compromise,''
Clinton said in his White House departure remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called last week for the talks, saying negotiators for
both sides had reached an impasse that has ground the peace process
to a dangerous stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   Building on that theme, he warned the parties Tuesday against
believing that time was on their side, that either one might
improve their negotiating prospects by stalling or by kicking
painful decisions down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parties have proven that peace is possible when they are
determined to make it,'' Clinton said. ``In the process, they have
passed the point of no return. The only way forward now is
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hopes to tie up in the coming days a marathon diplomatic
undertaking kicked off at Camp David in 1978, when President Jimmy
Carter brokered a breakthrough peace accord between Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement called for Israel and the Palestinians to resolve
their outstanding disputes over the next five years, an objective
Clinton hopes to attain before he leaves July 19 for the annual
Group of Eight summit in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The weight of history fell with a thud here on this 18th-Century
crossroads at the foot of the Catoctin Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The town's 4,400 residents have grown used to seeing
presidential motorcades whiz up and down its otherwise quiet
streets. They've even accepted the inconvenience of having Clinton
take over the Maple Run golf course at the edge of town, once a
dairy farm and source of pancake syrup from the sugar maple trees
that still abound in these parts.
</P>
<P>
   This week, though, the town is inundated with more than 300
members of the international press corps, as well as scores of
high-level White House aides and U.S., Israeli and Palestinian
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Most town folk voiced pessimism about the prospects for a
comprehensive peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, that war's been going on forever ain't it,''
said 24-year-old Jeremy Hahn, who served four years in the Marine
Corps before returning to Thurmont to cut hair _ $7 for a flat top
_ in his dad's barber shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we're going to do is give 'em more money, they'll go back
there and shoot each other,'' Hahn said. ``That's the way I see
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat arrived at 1 a.m. ET at Camp David, where he was greeted

</P>
<P>
   ``Jim the Boy''
</P>
<P>
   ByTony Earley
</P>
<P>
   (Little, Brown, $23.95)
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to describe a book like this, a small gem that
appears without fanfare and quietly puts other novels to shame.
It's the story of 10-year-old Jim Glass, whose father died a week
before he was born and who has been raised by his mother and her
three unmarried brothers, known collectively to Jim as ``the
uncles.'' They are a makeshift but solid family, working their
North Carolina farm during the years of the Great Depression. The
action, like the book cover, is deceptively simple, involving a new
suitor for Jim's mother, a new friend for Jim at school and a trip
with one of his uncles that opens Jim's eyes to the world beyond
the small town of Aliceville. Earley, who writes beautifully and
yet with studied restraint, creates a tangible world with these
characters and conveys the deep and lasting importance of small
events in a boy's life. As always, the simplest stories are the
most difficult to tell - and this one is a triumph.

<P>
   ``Mountain City''
</P>
<P>
   By Gregory Martin
</P>
<P>
   (North Point, $21)
</P>
<P>
   Mountain City, Nev., is a mile long, limit to limit. Its
business district consists of seven buildings, including a gas
station and a bar. There are no stoplights or stop signs. Only 33
people live there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come and go,'' writes Martin, ``but when I'm there, that
makes 34.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's family has run the general store in Mountain City since
1958, but their ties to the place go back to their Basque
ancestors, who settled there during the 1800s. Through the drastic
population swings of the boom and bust mining towns, they have hung
on, taking jobs that kept them in the landscape they had come to
love. But life in Mountain City is fading fast. Martin writes this
meticulous memoir as if he hopes to preserve some affectionate but
unsentimental sense of his family and their home before they are
gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me,'' he says, ``home is the place I can't keep from
disappearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, by the end of the book Mountain City's population
is only 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Rant, Therefore I Am''
</P>
<P>
   By Dennis Miller
</P>
<P>
   (Doubleday, $21.95)
</P>
<P>
   Are you ready for some venom? Actually, that word is inadequate
to describe the rancorous, sump-sucking (Miller's term) disdain the
author feels for just about anybody or anything at any given time.
Among his targets: people who watch daytime talk shows (''I swear,
you can still see the jelly on their foreheads where the
electroshock terminals were attached''), the war on drugs (''If we
had any actual commitment, you'd be able to look at a map and see a
smoking hole where Colombia once was'') and the film ``Elizabeth''
(It's about ``some chick who's kind of nice-looking, then she
becomes Queen of England and gets all ugly and bald''). Whatever
will he say about football? These rants are from Miller's TV show,
and judging from sales of his previous collections, you'd think
they're very funny. We think what's hilarious in a monologue falls
flat on a page. Of course. that's just our opinion. We could be
wrong.

</P>
<P>
   Edited by John Bowe, Marisa Bowe and Sabin Streeter
</P>
<P>
   (Crown, $25)
</P>
<P>
   Here are selections from the Working column featured in the Web
magazine ``Word,'' which for several years has sent interviewers
across the country to listen to people talk about their jobs.
Included here are a corporate headhunter, a crime-scene cleaner, a
financial adviser, a bus driver, a McDonald's worker, a buffalo
rancher, a diet center owner, a porn star, a professional
snowboarder, an actress, an FBI agent, a palm reader, a plastic
surgeon, a waitress and many others. A UPS driver admits that he
gives lousy service to customers who don't tip well at Christmas, a
gun store owner says he is ``basically unemployable - I have a
problem with authority figures,'' and a paparazzo describes the day
actor Alec Baldwin punched him and broke his nose for trying to
shoot video of Baldwin bringing home his newborn daughter. The
interviewees, many of whom are remarkably candid, are identified by
their real names.

MULLEN FACES LOSS OF L.L. BEAN, MONSTER.COM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a blow to its prestige and revenues, ad agency Mullen
acknowledged Tuesday that it could lose two premier clients, Maine
retailer L.L. Bean Inc. and Monster.com of Maynard, the job-search
and career-management Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Mullen and L.L. Bean have ``mutually agreed to part ways,'' said
Mullen chief executive Joe Grimaldi a few hours after Monster.com
announced that it had hired Pile and Co., a Boston consulting firm,
to conduct an ad agency review on its behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Because Mullen, New England's third largest ad agency, has been
invited to participate in that review, it is possible that Mullen
could still get to keep Monster.com's business.
</P>
<P>
   Mullen created considerable buzz for Monster.com with a 1999
Super Bowl ad. The ad featured kids who said things like, ``When I
grow up, I want to be a yes-man,'' and ``When I grow up, I want to
claw my way up to middle management.'' But a Monster.com ad that
aired during this year's Super Bowl attracted less notice.
</P>
<P>
   Though they became public on the same day, the decisions by L.L.
Bean and Monster.com to reevaluate their ad strategies were
unrelated and coincidental in their timing, Grimaldi said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Mullen were to lose both L.L. Bean and Monster.com as
clients, their departures would deduct only about $25 million from
Mullen's annual billings, Grimaldi insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to more than $80 million in new business, Mullen still
projects billings of $400 million this year, up from $340 million
in 1999, Grimaldi said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement accompanying the announcement that it is seeking
an ad agency review, Monster.com chief executive Jeff Taylor said:
``We have had a successful partnership with Mullen. Monster.com has
experienced tremendous growth over the last two years, and the
challenges associated with establishing this brand _ and continuing
our push in the US market _ are compounded by our aggressive global
growth strategies.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's statement suggests that Monster.com might be seeking an
ad agency far larger than Mullen, a small shop based in Wenham,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Monster.com said that the assignment it is putting into review
could be worth $75 million to $90 million a year to the winning ad
agency.
</P>
<P>
   L.L. Bean also has asked Pile and Co. to conduct an ad agency
review, but Mullen said it will not be a participant.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak, L.L. Bean spent $25 million a year on advertising,
said L.L. Bean spokesman Rich Donaldson.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, losing as much as $115 million in billings could be a
crushing blow to a mid-size agency such as Mullen.
</P>
<P>
   But Grimaldi claimed that the actual economic impact on Mullen
of losing both accounts would be so small that no layoffs would be
needed at an agency that employs 380 staffers.
</P>
<P>
   In the advertising business, perception is often reality, and
losing high-profile clients can hurt an agency's reputation as a
hot shop. The loss of L.L. Bean and the possible loss of
Monster.com come at a time of transition for Mullen.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Cos. of New
York bought a majority stake in Mullen.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, agency founder James Mullen gave over
day-to-day control of the ad agency to a management team led by
Grimaldi and chief creative officer Edward Boches.
</P>
<P>
   Mullen is well regarded. In appraising 1999 performance, Adweek
gave Mullen some of the highest marks awarded to a local agency.
Mullen's clients include Swiss Army Brands, Nextel Communications
Inc., Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, and a division of General
Motors Corp.

<P>
   HOUSTON _ It was an anonymous woman in the balcony who started
the song, in a small voice, and as the notes drifted over the
auditorium, heads turned and a hush fell.
</P>
<P>
   Soon those around her joined in, hesitantly at first, then more
boldly, until the triumphant words of the hymn widely known as the
Negro National Anthem seemed to be cascading to the floor of the
hall.
</P>
<P>
   There, more of the political faithful filling the Wortham Center
picked up the tune as they rose from their seats, and now hundreds
were singing in a tide of jubilation that swept over the stage, as
if to embrace Lee P. Brown, who had stood along with them, visibly
moved. He had become Houston's first black mayor that inaugural day
in 1998, and to many in the audience, he was a symbol of newfound
strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lift every voice and sing,'' the people sang, ``till earth and
heaven ring. Ring with the harmonies of liberty!''
</P>
<P>
   For all their joy, though, the day had been more than a
celebration of victory for blacks. It had also been a testament to
how racial and ethnic groups in Houston had put aside their
suspicions and rivalries and come together largely out of
self-interest to achieve power.
</P>
<P>
   In the audience were faces from that winning coalition. There
was Richard G. Castaneda, 54, a Mexican-American who owned an
engineering firm in metropolitan Houston. He had cast his lot with
Brown and become active in his campaign because he had trusted the
candidate when he said he would be fair to Latinos. And as a
businessman who got 70 percent of his work through a Houston
affirmative action program, Castaneda needed an open door at City
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   He had had doubts about supporting a black candidate, he said.
There were distant, bruising memories of being harassed by blacks.
But he had recognized that in Houston, where blacks, Anglos and
Hispanics each made up roughly a third of the population, the 21st
century would require interracial alliances in both politics and
business if any one group's interests were to be served. Hispanics,
he said, might even act as a swing group, allying themselves with
Anglos or blacks when it served their interests.
</P>
<P>
   But watching Brown bask in his moment of triumph, Castaneda
said, he also felt apprehensive. ``I wanted to see who he would
surround himself with,'' he remembers thinking. ``Who is he going
to turn the power over to?''
</P>
<P>
   Only rows away from Castaneda at the Wortham Center sat Richard
W. Lewis, 51, a white man with a large stake in Brown's victory. It
was Lewis who had nudged Castaneda, a business associate, to help
the campaign and to bring his Latino friends on board.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was no friend of affirmative action. In backing Brown, who
was, he had risked alienating the people he worked with, breaking
ranks with his own Houston Contractors Association, of which he was
a past president. The group, most of whose members were white, had
supported the white Republican front-runner largely because he
opposed affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewis, who describes himself as a ``Republican from the
womb,'' had fallen in behind Brown, a Democrat, on the basis of a
simple calculation: Brown would win. And as the owner of a local
construction company, Lewis, too, depended on a friendly City Hall.
Ninety percent of his business came from municipal contracts.
Backing the man he presumed would be the next mayor seemed only
prudent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be in a position of influence,'' he said, ``and
you can't influence a loser.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he heard the Negro hymn swelling up from the crowd, he
said, he suddenly felt unwelcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned me off,'' he recalled. Imagine that the Republican
had won, he said, ``and we had started singing the Confederate
song. It would have been equally out of place. It alienated you,
and that was the specific purpose of it, I'm sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian G. Smith, who is black, also had a lot riding on Brown's
victory, although he happened to be out of town on Inauguration
Day. Smith, a 41-year-old architect who runs his own construction
inspection company in Houston, had worked, like Lewis, as a Brown
fund-raiser and with both Lewis and Castaneda on the new mayor's
transition team. He was counting on Brown's election to provide
opportunities for blacks like him who do business with the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling had been that whites would stay in control of
Houston,'' Smith said. Now, ``it was like, `Wow! Our day has come.'
It felt like, at this time, it was good to be black.''
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, Smith had wanted a mayor friendly to
affirmative action. He remembered the affront of being denied work
because he was black. Like Castaneda, he owed most of his business,
95 percent, to the city law that sets aside about 18 percent of
city contracts for companies owned by minorities and women. And for
Smith, public projects like water systems, stadiums and rails were
where the money was.
</P>
<P>
   So his support for Brown, like that of the other men, had
largely been bound up with his business interests. Which was
nothing new for him. From the day Smith started his company, in
1987, business had driven his political involvement, he said, no
matter the candidate's color.
</P>
<P>
   ``For selfish reasons,'' he said. ``Trying to get work.'' This
time, with a black mayor, he said, ``I hoped for access.''
</P>
<P>
   REAFFIRMING AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
</P>
<P>
   Access, influence, money: all had been part of the political
calculus for Castaneda, Smith and Lewis. In the end, all three had
put practical considerations ahead of racial ones. Much as he
yearned for a black mayor, Smith said, he would have opposed Brown
if he had not supported affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, for his part, swallowed any misgivings because, he said,
Brown was ``a sincerely decent man'' whom the white community could
do business with.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you worry about is getting a radical,'' he said. ``I
don't want a Klan member as mayor, or a black militant.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown was no radical. He had been Houston's police chief in the
1980s. In 1990, David Dinkins, New York's only black mayor, lured
Brown to the city to be its police commissioner, a job in which he
took some heat for the roundly criticized police response to racial
violence in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn. He had also been
President Clinton's director of national drug control policy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the polls closed in a runoff election in 1997, Brown had
vindicated the men who had gambled on him, defeating the Republican
Rob Mosbacher, a businessman and son of a former commerce secretary
in the Bush administration, by 6 percentage points. Though Anglos
made up slightly more than half the turnout, Brown had won with 97
percent of the black vote, 66 percent of the Hispanic and 23
percent of the Anglo, according to an exit poll by Robert M. Stein
of Rice University.
</P>
<P>
   For Smith and Castaneda, the election of Lee Brown, a strong
advocate of affirmative action, was reassuring. They could be
confident of continued business with the city under the program,
especially since it had just dodged a bullet.
</P>
<P>
   A conservative initiative to scrap the city's program had been
on the ballot that election year. The measure reflected a national
mood against programs intended specifically to benefit minorities.
But thanks to a record turnout by minority voters, and despite a
2-to-1 Anglo vote to scuttle the program, the law was preserved.
That gave Houston the distinction of being the only major city in
the country to retain affirmative action in a challenge at the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   To Lewis, affirmative action was just another form of welfare
that in effect robbed him of profits. In his ample business with
the city, he had been required to subcontract to minority-owned
firms even when it was not to his financial advantage.
</P>
<P>
   It was thus a measure of his pragmatism that he could still back
Brown despite their polar differences on a critical campaign issue.
Lewis had decided that it was only one issue.
</P>
<P>
   As he analyzed the mayoral race in 1997, he said, he could see
that Anglos in Houston were outnumbered in the aggregate by blacks,
Latinos and Asians from Vietnam, China and India. Demographic
trends were also suggesting that Anglos would dwindle in numbers
even more. The days of conservative Republican mayors _ his own
choice, he acknowledged, if he had had his druthers _ were pretty
much gone.
</P>
<P>
   So his city, the nation's fourth largest, had been transformed.
``I feel like I can't do anything about it,'' he said. Except work
with it.
</P>
<P>
   In the two and a half years since Brown's inauguration, the
pragmatism that drew the three men together has begun to bear fruit
in the form of new business and political alliances and an
opportunity to collaborate on a major city water project.
</P>
<P>
   But to Castaneda, the new order is less about Brown than about
the larger demographic forces. ``Regardless of who is mayor now,
that mayor has to be accountable to a lot of people,'' he said. ``I
don't think there's any way that in the future anybody can screw us
over. We've just learned too much about the political system for
that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others have also learned what can be gained through a
system of ``racial coalitions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you measure it in terms of dollars,'' he said, ``we've
never made as much money as we're making.''
</P>
<P>
   THE MIDDLE PLAYS BOTH ENDS
</P>
<P>
   In the tug of war between blacks and Anglos, Hispanics can pull
on either end of the rope. Richard Castaneda began to demonstrate
this shortly after the election.
</P>
<P>
   He was raising money to pay off the mayor's campaign debt and
calling Anglo engineers he knew, many of whom belonged to the trade
group that had supported Brown's opponent. They would be wise, he
told them, to deal with the Brown administration outside of the
trade group _ and to be associated with the allies of the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, `We can help you,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the bigger Anglo-owned firms would help smaller
Hispanic ones land work, at least as subcontractors. And they would
pool money to donate to political candidates, to make them pay
attention.
</P>
<P>
   His case was persuasive. An informal Hispanic-Anglo alliance
christened the Dirty Dozen was born, and it raised more than
$100,000. Hispanic engineers had not only won points with the mayor
by helping retire his debt; with City Hall as the lure, they had
reeled in Anglos for common gain.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Dirty Dozen _ there are actually 15, and 10 of them
are Anglo _ chase projects together, send work one another's way
and meet with city officials as a group.
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda and his partner at Omega Engineers, Edelmiro Castillo,
who is also in the Dirty Dozen, have a second power base: the
Houston Hispanic Architects and Engineers, a 50-member association
that tries to cultivate good relations both with big companies and
with politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Castillo, the president of the Hispanic group, got a
call from his counterpart with a group of Asian-Americans.
Minorities should unite, the Asian architect said. Castillo agreed.
The timing was right. They had a fair-minded black mayor. A
bustling economy had turned Houston into a boomtown for the
construction industry. There were lawsuits testing affirmative
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to say we're the coalition of the minority
groups,'' Castillo said, ``and whenever there are any decisions
made, we want to be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   A glue binding Houston's minority groups was the city's
affirmative action program, which set goals, not quotas, for
minority participation. The program ensured minority-owned
companies that they would have a shot at getting a piece of city
contracts. The companies' political connections at City Hall
ensured that they would have an edge on the minority competition.
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda used to think affirmative action was for losers. He
called it ``white-collar welfare,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before he went into business for himself in the
1980s just as Texas' oil and construction industries were going
bust, and he went through half his savings in six months to support
his family. Affirmative action saved his business, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all opportunity should be predicated on skin color,
Castaneda said; a person's ability and determination are still the
primary ingredients for success. But before the affirmative action
law passed, in 1984, about 1 percent of city contracts went to
firms owned by minority group members and women; now about 18
percent do. He said he wondered if the number would not go back to
single digits if the law disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``My conscience tells me that affirmative action is a good way
to give people opportunities without social upheaval,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Teaming with Anglos on one hand and nonwhites on the other,
Houston's Hispanics display a kind of cross-racial dexterity that
blacks and whites appear to manage less easily. Castaneda has a
theory about why. ``There's still big mistrust between the whites
and the blacks,'' he said, ``and I think it's still much easier for
each group to get together with Hispanics than each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis agrees that Anglos and Latinos get along better. Latinos
are less confrontational than blacks, less ``hardheaded,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He prides himself on working with people of different races. His
foreman of 10 years, Leroy Robinson, is black. His crews are mostly
Latino. He is a mentor to minority business owners. And he defends
his trade group, saying it welcomes everybody. It is the minorities
who shun it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't separate yourself and then holler integration,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For Lewis, affirmative action was all downside. By making him
give minority-owned firms almost a fifth of the construction work
he gets from the city, he said, the law forces him either to
subcontract work that his company could do itself or to pass up
Anglo subcontractors who charge less.
</P>
<P>
   ``Affirmative action is unconstitutional,'' he said. ``Why don't
we just call it Anybody But Whites?''
</P>
<P>
   His main argument against the program is that it is no longer
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got into construction, it was a bunch of
cowboys,'' he said. ``They were drinking and chasing women. Now, by
and large, they are business people. They take Metamucil at 8
o'clock and go to bed at 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``That changes the way everybody looks at each other. When I
hire a man, I could care less what color you are. If you're
dependable, if you don't steal, we embrace you.''
</P>
<P>
   If someone like Castaneda needs affirmative action after 16
years in business, he said, maybe he should not be in business.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that affirmative action is a crutch, to be accepted
with shame, angers Smith. ``I don't cease being black, or being
discriminated against,'' he said, an edge in his voice. ``That
doesn't change, so I'm not trying to graduate out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``If there's nothing to force majority firms to
contract minority firms, they wouldn't do it. Why split the pie if
you can have all of it? It is a race issue, but it has more to do
with money.''
</P>
<P>
   Affirmative action, Smith said, has been ``the only thing in the
last 200 years that has excluded whites.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So I can't feel sorry for them.''
</P>
<P>
   A CALCULATED MOVE PAYS OFF
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, Castaneda and Smith all say they have no complaints about
how the mayor has treated them.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of their connections to the Brown
administration, ties that were forged during the 1997 campaign, the
three were selected to join a team of industry professionals
competing for a $100 million contract to build the Northeast Water
Purification Project. The team is led by a group of private
companies that also chose the men because they brought racial
diversity to the table. Though the project is not subject to
affirmative action regulations because it is being built with
private money, it will still need to obtain approval from the city,
the plant's client, and the City Council is made up of blacks,
whites, Latinos and one Asian-American. In this case, Castaneda
says, political realities have dictated the need for diversity,
with or without the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Utopia, this is how it should work,'' Castaneda said.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever promise of equal opportunity is embodied in that
team, it is not a reason to scrap affirmative action, he said. Even
with a mixed population and a multi-hued council to represent it,
he said, there would be no guarantee that minority companies would
be given a fair shake in an industry still dominated by Anglo-owned
companies. And in politics, he said, even a minority leader could
be bought or could enter into an alliance out of self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can leave it up to people's judgment,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, Smith and Castaneda all agree that one of Brown's
legacies will be the way he has led minorities, not just blacks,
into government.
</P>
<P>
   THE FUTURE
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1960, whites made up 70 percent of the city's
population, blacks 23 percent and Hispanics 7 percent. By 1997,
whites were 35 percent, blacks 28 and Hispanics 31. By 2030, it is
projected, Latinos will account for more than 50 percent of the
population of Harris County, which includes Houston. Whites,
meanwhile, will dip to 21 percent and blacks to 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever movement there is toward greater Hispanic power,
Lewis is not troubled by it. He said he did not know many whites
who fretted about their shrinking numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not concerned about it as long as green controls,'' he
said. ``They're the establishment. That's the establishment you
have to blend with, and if you're not going to blend, you're not
going to be accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   If one prospect is a kind of assimilation, as Lewis envisions,
and another is continued ethnic divisions, as others predict, yet
another is long-term coalitions, which Castaneda said he hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the blacks and Hispanics made a coalition, they could do a
lot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To Smith, blacks may have achieved power at City Hall just in
time to hand it over to Latinos. ``At some point, we are not going
to be able to get a black mayor,'' he said. ``I hope we'll have a
Hispanic mayor that we can trust to be inclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   A more immediate issue is the fate of affirmative action. Some
city officials see it as a stabilizing force, but with lawsuits
pending, opponents like Lewis expect a court to strike down the
city law any day. Already, the Brown administration has endorsed
two new race- and gender-neutral contracting programs.
</P>
<P>
   When the time comes for the men to cash in or retire, they plan
to retreat to their separate worlds. Castaneda thinks of moving
permanently to a lakeside home near San Antonio. Lewis plans to
live at least part of the time in Matagorda. Only Smith feels
rooted in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The three have made a living in the same arena, sometimes
helping each other get jobs, sometimes coming together out of
mutual interest. But outside that arena, they said, they were not
sure whether they would have any reason to see one another again.
</P>
<P>
   Most relationships outside the family are superficial anyway,
Castaneda said.
</P>
<P>
   And though Houston has made him feel ``95 percent comfortable''
around other ethnic groups, he said, there is that remaining 5
percent, which he calls distrust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they're watching what they say,'' Castaneda said of
Lewis and Smith, ``because under normal circumstances, they could
be saying something insensitive towards me.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who views opposition to affirmative action as racist,
said he had nothing in common with Lewis except their support for a
mayoral candidate. He said he felt closer to Castaneda.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewis says friendship is not the point; tolerance is _
``where we don't have this open hostility toward one another.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You work together well; we treat each other civilly,'' he
said. ``We send each other work.
</P>
<P>
   ``How close are we supposed to be?''

GRAY WOLF MAY BE HEADED OFF THE ENDANGERED LIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT BRAILE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Calling it a success story on a par with the comeback of the
bald eagle, federal wildlife officials announced Tuesday that the
gray wolf, hunted nearly to extinction a century ago, has rebounded
enough to no longer be considered an endangered species in most of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   The wolves, which once roamed from Canada to Mexico, have been
stalked for centuries like no other animal, starting in 1630, when
the Massachusetts Bay Colony paid a month's salary for each one
killed. By the time they received federal protection in 1973 there
were only a few hundred left.
</P>
<P>
   But nowadays, with more than 3,500 wolves living in eight
states, US Fish and Wildlife Service officials said it is time to
ease the tough nationwide protections they have enjoyed under the
federal Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolves are a living symbol of the regard Americans have for
things wild,'' said Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, announcing
the proposal to reclassify wolves from endangered to threatened in
the Northeast and two other regions and to strip them of all
federal protection in 30 states. Endangered species get more legal
protection than threatened species.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt's optimism may seem odd in New England, where there are
so few wolves that a single sighting is big news, and
environmentalists are pushing a controversial plan to import wolves
to replenish the stock in Maine or New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   However, some federal officials believe reduced protections for
wolves may actually improve prospects for reintroducing them here
by easing private land owners' fears that the wolf's arrival would
trigger serious limits on the use of their land.
</P>
<P>
   But activists who have been pushing to bring the wolf back to
the Northeast rejected that logic. They called Babbitt's plan to
``downlist'' protections for wolves a concession to the ranchers,
sheep farmers and land owners who see wolves as a hazard to their
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Changing the wolves from endangered to threatened ``is a purely
political move with no biological basis whatsoever,'' said Michael
Kellett, executive director of Restore the North Woods, which
supports reintroduction of wolves in the Northeast. ``We're going
to urge people to support the strongest recovery plan possible, and
to oppose the downlisting.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, wolves are considered endangered in all of the lower
48 states except Minnesota. They would remain so in the Southwest
under Babbitt's proposal, which would be final a year from now
after public hearings. Even if wolves are downlisted to threatened,
it would still be illegal to shoot them.
</P>
<P>
   If the proposal survives the public debate ahead, it would
signify an extraordinary compromise between critics and supporters
of wolf recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have included private property groups and many states,
including New Hampshire where the legislature approved a bill last
year banning wolf reintroduction there. On the other side,
environmental groups have played on the wolf's charisma to build
support for reintroducing the animal.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise is evident in the Service's plan to involve
critics and supporters in writing the recovery plan, the document
that will guide efforts to build up wolf populations. And, under a
special rule included in the proposal for the Northeast, wolves
that kill livestock or otherwise threaten people and property could
be shot or relocated. Such concessions are intended to appease
landowners and legislators alike, who may fear the federal
government even more than the wolves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would give us quite a bit more flexibility,'' said Paul
Nickerson, chief of the Fish and Wildlife Service's Northeast
regional endangered species office. ``Unlike other areas of the
country, where there is a great deal of public land, whatever
recovery we do here will occur on private land, with the full
cooperation of private landowners.''
</P>
<P>
   To the timber industry, which owns millions of acres in the four
states and has been uneasy about wolf recovery, such overtures are
welcome. They are nervous that wolves may wander into Maine from
Canada, potentially triggering all sorts of efforts to protect the
animals at their expense.
</P>
<P>
   So far, although animals believed to be wolves have been shot in
Maine in 1993 and 1996, there is no documented evidence of a
current population.
</P>
<P>
   Timber industry officials particularly praised the idea of
helping to write a recovery plan which spelled out what logging and
other activities can take place in potential wolf habitat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the many restrictions that often follow Endangered
Species Act listings, it'd be a stretch to say our members would be
thankful if wolves actually do show up in Maine,'' said Andrew
Kekacs, a spokesman for the Maine Forest Products Council. ``But if
they do, at least we'd know that we're not doing anything in our
forest practices that's incompatible with them.''

<P>
   HOUSTON _ It was an anonymous woman in the balcony who started
the song, in a small voice, and as the notes drifted over the
auditorium, heads turned and a hush fell.
</P>
<P>
   Soon those around her joined in, hesitantly at first, then more
boldly, until the triumphant words of the hymn widely known as the
Negro National Anthem seemed to be cascading to the floor of the
hall.
</P>
<P>
   There, more of the political faithful filling the Wortham Center
picked up the tune as they rose from their seats, and now hundreds
were singing in a tide of jubilation that swept over the stage, as
if to embrace Lee P. Brown, who had stood along with them, visibly
moved. He had become Houston's first black mayor that inaugural day
in 1998, and to many in the audience, he was a symbol of newfound
strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lift every voice and sing,'' the people sang, ``till earth and
heaven ring. Ring with the harmonies of liberty!''
</P>
<P>
   For all their joy, though, the day had been more than a
celebration of victory for blacks. It had also been a testament to
how racial and ethnic groups in Houston had put aside their
suspicions and rivalries and come together largely out of
self-interest to achieve power.
</P>
<P>
   In the audience were faces from that winning coalition. There
was Richard G. Castaneda, 54, a Mexican-American who owned an
engineering firm in metropolitan Houston. He had cast his lot with
Brown and become active in his campaign because he had trusted the
candidate when he said he would be fair to Latinos. And as a
businessman who got 70 percent of his work through a Houston
affirmative action program, Castaneda needed an open door at City
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   He had had doubts about supporting a black candidate, he said.
There were distant, bruising memories of being harassed by blacks.
But he had recognized that in Houston, where blacks, Anglos and
Hispanics each made up roughly a third of the population, the 21st
century would require interracial alliances in both politics and
business if any one group's interests were to be served. Hispanics,
he said, might even act as a swing group, allying themselves with
Anglos or blacks when it served their interests.
</P>
<P>
   But watching Brown bask in his moment of triumph, Castaneda
said, he also felt apprehensive. ``I wanted to see who he would
surround himself with,'' he remembers thinking. ``Who is he going
to turn the power over to?''
</P>
<P>
   It was a question that had come up during Brown's campaign. One
cold morning at Velia's Cafe, about 100 prominent Latinos gathered
to meet the candidate over breakfast. There was one thing everybody
wanted to know, Castaneda recalled, and the question was finally
asked: ``One person got up and said, `Look, we're concerned you're
going to screw us over and give everything to the blacks.'''
</P>
<P>
   Only rows away from Castaneda at the Wortham Center sat Richard
W. Lewis, 51, a white man with a large stake in Brown's victory. It
was Lewis who had nudged Castaneda, a business associate, to help
the campaign and to bring his Latino friends on board.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was no friend of affirmative action. In backing Brown, who
was, he had risked alienating the people he worked with, breaking
ranks with his own Houston Contractors Association, of which he was
a past president. The group, most of whose members were white, had
supported the white Republican front-runner largely because he
opposed affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewis, who describes himself as a ``Republican from the
womb,'' had fallen in behind Brown, a Democrat, on the basis of a
simple calculation: Brown would win. And as the owner of a local
construction company, Lewis, too, depended on a friendly City Hall.
Ninety percent of his business came from municipal contracts.
Backing the man he presumed would be the next mayor seemed only
prudent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be in a position of influence,'' he said, ``and
you can't influence a loser.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he heard the Negro hymn swelling up from the crowd, he
said, he suddenly felt unwelcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned me off,'' he recalled. Imagine that the Republican
had won, he said, ``and we had started singing the Confederate
song. It would have been equally out of place. It alienated you,
and that was the specific purpose of it, I'm sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian G. Smith, who is black, also had a lot riding on Brown's
victory. Smith, a 41-year-old architect who runs his own
construction inspection company in Houston, had worked, like Lewis,
as a Brown fund-raiser and with both Lewis and Castaneda on the new
mayor's transition team. He was counting on Brown's election to
provide opportunities for blacks like him who do business with the
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling had been that whites would stay in control of
Houston,'' Smith said. Now, ``it was like, `Wow! Our day has come.'
It felt like, at this time, it was good to be black.''
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, Smith had wanted a mayor friendly to
affirmative action. He remembered the affront of being denied work
because he was black. Like Castaneda, he owed most of his business,
95 percent, to the city law that sets aside about 18 percent of
city contracts for companies owned by minorities and women. And for
Smith, public projects like water systems, stadiums and rails were
where the money was.
</P>
<P>
   So his support for Brown, like that of the other men, had
largely been bound up with his business interests. Which was
nothing new for him. From the day Smith started his company, in
1987, business had driven his political involvement, he said, no
matter the candidate's color.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``For selfish reasons,'' he said. ``Trying to get work.'' This
time, with a black mayor, he said, ``I hoped for access.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith was away on Inauguration Day and sent his mother to attend
the ceremony in his place. She told him about how glorious it had
been when everyone stood in a great wave and sang the hymn. He
remembers how he felt on hearing about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Electrified,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   REAFFIRMING AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
</P>
<P>
   Access, influence, money: all had been part of the political
calculus for Castaneda, Smith and Lewis. In the end, all three had
put practical considerations ahead of racial ones. Much as he
yearned for a black mayor, Smith said, he would have opposed Brown
if he had not supported affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, for his part, swallowed any misgivings because, he said,
Brown was ``a sincerely decent man'' whom the white community could
do business with.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you worry about is getting a radical,'' he said. ``I
don't want a Klan member as mayor, or a black militant.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown was no radical. He had been Houston's police chief in the
1980s. In 1990, David Dinkins, New York's only black mayor, lured
Brown to the city to be its police commissioner, a job in which he
took some heat for the roundly criticized police response to racial
violence in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn. He had also been
President Clinton's director of national drug control policy.
</P>
<P>
   When the polls closed in a runoff election in 1997, Brown had
vindicated the men who had gambled on him, defeating the Republican
Rob Mosbacher, a businessman and son of a former commerce secretary
in the Bush administration, by 6 percentage points. Though Anglos
made up slightly more than half the turnout, Brown had won with 97
percent of the black vote, 66 percent of the Hispanic and 23
percent of the Anglo, according to an exit poll by Robert M. Stein
of Rice University.
</P>
<P>
   For Smith and Castaneda, the election of Lee Brown, a strong
advocate of affirmative action, was reassuring. They could be
confident of continued business with the city under the program,
especially since it had just dodged a bullet.
</P>
<P>
   A conservative initiative to scrap the city's program had been
on the ballot that election year. The measure reflected a national
mood against programs intended specifically to benefit minorities.
But thanks to a record turnout by minority voters, and despite a
2-to-1 Anglo vote to scuttle the program, the law was preserved.
That gave Houston the distinction of being the only major city in
the country to retain affirmative action in a challenge at the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   To Lewis, affirmative action was just another form of welfare
that in effect robbed him of profits. In his ample business with
the city, he had been required to subcontract to minority-owned
firms even when it was not to his financial advantage.
</P>
<P>
   It was thus a measure of his pragmatism that he could still back
Brown despite their polar differences on a critical campaign issue.
Lewis had decided that it was only one issue.
</P>
<P>
   As he analyzed the mayoral race in 1997, he said, he could see
that Anglos in Houston were outnumbered in the aggregate by blacks,
Latinos and Asians from Vietnam, China and India. Demographic
trends were also suggesting that Anglos would dwindle in numbers
even more. The days of conservative Republican mayors _ his own
choice, he acknowledged, if he had had his druthers _ were pretty
much gone.
</P>
<P>
   So his city, the nation's fourth largest, had been transformed.
``I feel like I can't do anything about it,'' he said. Except work
with it.
</P>
<P>
   In the two and a half years since Brown's inauguration, the
pragmatism that drew the three men together has begun to bear fruit
in the form of new business and political alliances and an
opportunity to collaborate on a major city water project.
</P>
<P>
   But to Castaneda, the new order is less about Brown than about
the larger demographic forces. ``Regardless of who is mayor now,
that mayor has to be accountable to a lot of people,'' he said. ``I
don't think there's any way that in the future anybody can screw us
over. We've just learned too much about the political system for
that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others have also learned what can be gained through a
system of ``racial coalitions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you measure it in terms of dollars,'' he said, ``we've
never made as much money as we're making.''
</P>
<P>
   THE MIDDLE PLAYS BOTH ENDS
</P>
<P>
   In the tug of war between blacks and Anglos, Hispanics can pull
on either end of the rope. Richard Castaneda began to demonstrate
this shortly after the election.
</P>
<P>
   He was raising money to pay off the mayor's campaign debt and
calling Anglo engineers he knew, many of whom belonged to the trade
group that had supported Brown's opponent. They would be wise, he
told them, to deal with the Brown administration outside of the
trade group _ and to be associated with the allies of the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, `We can help you,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the bigger Anglo-owned firms would help smaller
Hispanic ones land work, at least as subcontractors. And they would
pool money to donate to political candidates, to make them pay
attention.
</P>
<P>
   His case was persuasive. An informal Hispanic-Anglo alliance
christened the Dirty Dozen was born, and it raised more than
$100,000. Hispanic engineers had not only won points with the mayor
by helping retire his debt; with City Hall as the lure, they had
reeled in Anglos for common gain.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Dirty Dozen _ there are actually 15, and 10 of them
are Anglo _ chase projects together, send work one another's way
and meet with city officials as a group.
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda and his partner at Omega Engineers, Edelmiro Castillo,
who is also in the Dirty Dozen, have a second power base: the
Houston Hispanic Architects and Engineers, a 50-member association
that tries to cultivate good relations both with big companies and
with politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Castillo, the president of the Hispanic group, got a
call from his counterpart with a group of Asian-Americans.
Minorities should unite, the Asian architect said. Castillo agreed.
The timing was right. They had a fair-minded black mayor. A
bustling economy had turned Houston into a boomtown for the
construction industry. There were lawsuits testing affirmative
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to say we're the coalition of the minority
groups,'' Castillo said, ``and whenever there are any decisions
made, we want to be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   A glue binding Houston's minority groups was the city's
affirmative action program, which set goals, not quotas, for
minority participation. The program ensured minority-owned
companies that they would have a shot at getting a piece of city
contracts. The companies' political connections at City Hall
ensured that they would have an edge on the minority competition.
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda used to think affirmative action was for losers. He
called it ``white-collar welfare,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before he went into business for himself in the
1980s just as Texas' oil and construction industries were going
bust, and he went through half his savings in six months to support
his family. Affirmative action saved his business, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all opportunity should be predicated on skin color,
Castaneda said; a person's ability and determination are still the
primary ingredients for success. But before the affirmative action
law passed, in 1984, about 1 percent of city contracts went to
firms owned by minority group members and women; now about 18
percent do. He said he wondered if the number would not go back to
single digits if the law disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``My conscience tells me that affirmative action is a good way
to give people opportunities without social upheaval,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Teaming with Anglos on one hand and nonwhites on the other,
Houston's Hispanics display a kind of cross-racial dexterity that
blacks and whites appear to manage less easily. Castaneda has a
theory about why. ``There's still big mistrust between the whites
and the blacks,'' he said, ``and I think it's still much easier for
each group to get together with Hispanics than each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Castaneda suspects there is a limit to how close blacks want
to be to Hispanics. When a Mexican-American friend ran for county
judge, Castaneda called four black business friends to solicit
money and got no answer. ``I don't know if they don't trust me, or
they're just cheap, or they don't have any interest,'' he said,
``but I've never been able to break through that barrier.''
</P>
<P>
   At least among Anglos, he said, he can find a few who will give
money, and sometimes one who will tell it to him straight. In the
case of the judge's race, he called Lewis to find out why his
contractors' group was not returning calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, partner,'' he remembers Lewis saying, ``let me tell you
what the problem is. That boy doesn't know how to talk. He sounds
like he just came from Mexico. There's no way he's going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda had understood, he said. He had even advised the
candidate to take a diction class, to lose the accent. He refused,
saying voters would see beyond that. He lost.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis agrees that Anglos and Latinos get along better. Latinos
are less confrontational than blacks, less ``hardheaded,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He prides himself on working with people of different races. His
foreman of 10 years, Leroy Robinson, is black. His crews are mostly
Latino. He is a mentor to minority business owners. And he defends
his trade group, saying it welcomes everybody. It is the minorities
who shun it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't separate yourself and then holler integration,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For Lewis, affirmative action was all downside. By making him
give minority-owned firms almost a fifth of the construction work
he gets from the city, he said, the law forces him either to
subcontract work that his company could do itself or to pass up
Anglo subcontractors who charge less.
</P>
<P>
   ``Affirmative action is unconstitutional,'' he said. ``Why don't
we just call it Anybody But Whites?''
</P>
<P>
   His main argument against the program is that it is no longer
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got into construction, it was a bunch of
cowboys,'' he said. ``They were drinking and chasing women. Now, by
and large, they are business people. They take Metamucil at 8
o'clock and go to bed at 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``That changes the way everybody looks at each other. When I
hire a man, I could care less what color you are. If you're
dependable, if you don't steal, we embrace you.''
</P>
<P>
   If someone like Castaneda needs affirmative action after 16
years in business, he said, maybe he should not be in business.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that affirmative action is a crutch, to be accepted
with shame, angers Smith. ``I don't cease being black, or being
discriminated against,'' he said, an edge in his voice. ``That
doesn't change, so I'm not trying to graduate out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``If there's nothing to force majority firms to
contract minority firms, they wouldn't do it. Why split the pie if
you can have all of it? It is a race issue, but it has more to do
with money.''
</P>
<P>
   There was not much pie for blacks when Smith began looking for a
job in 1984 after he received his degree in architecture from
Southern University in Baton Rouge, La.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would lay out my nice portfolio and people would hardly look
at my work,'' he said. ``They'd look at me and say, `No, we're not
hiring.'''
</P>
<P>
   Black firms were hiring, and Smith found work. But in 1987 he
decided to take advantage of the affirmative action law and opened
his own firm, Brian Smith Construction Inspection Inc., providing
not architecture but construction management.
</P>
<P>
   Today, even with 34 employees and a good track record, Smith
finds his dealings with white-owned companies to be ``really
something.'' He is asked absurd questions, he said, like whether he
offers employee benefits. ``They think you work out of your
house,'' he said, ``or it's just you in a room and you're pulling
their leg.''
</P>
<P>
   But he does not feel threatened, he said, when he walks into a
meeting with white men. ``I don't bite my tongue,'' he said. ``I
don't view this as a white man's world.'' He added, ``I'm there
because I'm fighting for the money that's on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said a pilgrimage to Africa in 1992 did more than anything
to equip him to deal with racial indignities. In Ghana, where he
believes his ancestors were from, he toured a castle where slaves
had been held for trans-Atlantic passage. In the dungeon, he said,
he saw the ``door of no return'' through which slaves were pulled
onto an auction block and then onto ships. Above the auction block,
he said, he found a church.
</P>
<P>
   The slave sellers, he said, ``would auction off slaves
downstairs, and then they would go upstairs in their own chapel and
pray to the same God I pray to, and they call themselves
Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   It only confirmed for him, he said, that if white people were
capable of that, they could not be superior to him.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, Smith said, he felt more at ease shopping his
services among Hispanic firms. With their lighter skin, Latinos may
be more acceptable to whites than to blacks, he said, but he
nonetheless feels a kinship with Latinos as members of a minority
group. On an issue like affirmative action, he said, they are on
one side and whites like Lewis are on the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no hope for us as minorities if he can't acknowledge
that it's wrong that less than 40 percent of the population gets 90
percent of the work,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Affirmative action, he said, has been ``the only thing in the
last 200 years that has excluded whites.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So I can't feel sorry for them.''
</P>
<P>
   WITH EACH HIS OWN
</P>
<P>
   About 40 boys and their relatives were gathered in Hermann Park
on a Saturday in May for a Cub Scout rite of passage. While his
father snapped pictures and his mother looked on proudly, Brian
Nelson Stewart Smith, age 7, stepped out of a cluster of boys when
his name was called, a shy smile under his big round glasses, and
received a yellow neckerchief, a symbol of his rise in rank.
Everyone applauded. Everyone was black.
</P>
<P>
   The parents had set up tables of food and drink under the
pitched roof of an open-air pavilion. The elder Brian Smith had
provided the inspectors while the city was building the pavilion.
So in some ways the setting carried symbolic weight of its own. It
was a testament to how far Smith had come, starting from the
low-income housing he had lived in until he was 9.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the occasion also attested to how much Smith wanted Brian
and his other son, 23-month-old Micah, to relive parts of his own
childhood. The younger Brian belongs to the same scout pack that
his father had. It meets in the same black church, Wheeler Avenue
Baptist, that Smith has belonged to since age 6 and where he is a
deacon. As a boy, Smith, whose parents were college graduates,
attended a predominantly black public school. His son goes to a
predominantly black private school.
</P>
<P>
   Smith says he is giving his sons a racial grounding before they
are ``tainted'' by the world. He himself remains anchored in a
black world. He is on the board of a black-owned bank. His best
friends are black. He takes family vacations to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and his wife, Elizabeth, 43, a NASA engineer, live in an
upper-middle-class, racially mixed neighborhood. In September they
plan to move into a mostly black area nearby, where they have
bought a four-bedroom house with a pool and a tennis court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a conscious choice,'' Smith said of the effort to
furnish his sons with a black identity. ``Once you know who you
are,'' he said, then ``go learn about other cultures.''
</P>
<P>
   If Smith's world is largely segregated, so are those of
Castaneda and Lewis. The three men may run into one another at a
political fund-raiser or at the Department of Public Works and
Engineering. Two of them may even get together for the rare social
occasion. Once, Lewis and his wife dropped by the Castanedas' to
pick up some decorative grass plants; the couples live in the same
suburb, Katy. Once, the Castanedas went to a ballgame at the
Astrodome at the invitation of Smith, who had rented a box.
</P>
<P>
   But generally, so separate are their private and professional
lives that both Castaneda and Smith were stunned to learn that
Lewis was an ordained minister who sang every Sunday at a little
church in Matagorda, a small town on the Gulf of Mexico where the
Lewises have a weekend home. Indeed, the blunt, wisecracking
businessman who wears jeans and black leather boots and carries a
concealed handgun barely resembled the Lewis who spoke with teary
eyes one Sunday in May. The pastor, C.J. Molmen, was retiring from
the Community Baptist Church after nine years, and this was his
last service.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The church has 50 members, but on this day the pews held only
17, including two black women and a Hispanic family of four. Molmen
was the one who ordained him in December, Lewis told the
congregation. The pastor was also the one who had encouraged Lewis'
wife of 15 years, Betty, a 44-year-old former hairdresser, to play
the piano. She had never touched a keyboard, she said, but one day,
at the pastor's prodding, she sat down and played.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a miracle,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The son of an electrician who was also a Baptist deacon, Lewis
grew up in Port Arthur, a refinery town. In 1970, after college, he
took a job with an engineering company that transferred him to
Houston. But he grew restless quickly and decided to start a
construction firm with two partners.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen years later, RWL Construction Inc., which specializes
in utility projects like water mains, has 50 employees and enough
profits to easily pay for a grand new Southern Colonial home for
Richard and Betty Lewis. They are planning to move in soon, their
three children _ two from his first marriage, one from hers _
having grown.
</P>
<P>
   The new home, in Eagle Lake, a small town west of the city, came
with white pillars, a guest house and a black-face porch figure.
Lewis said he was getting rid of the figure, though, just as he was
getting rid of the many other artifacts _ ``Southern folk art,'' he
calls them _ depicting blacks that decorate his home in Katy. ``I
don't want to offend anybody needlessly,'' he said wearily. ``It
means nothing to us. Now everybody has gotten so darned
sensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   While Smith and Lewis each retreat to one world, Castaneda has
his feet in two. He reared his son and daughter in the mostly Anglo
environment of Katy, where he and his wife, Christina, 53, an
accounting assistant with ExxonMobil Chemical, moved 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he has always regarded San Antonio as home. That is where
his mother's homemade tortillas await. That is where Spanish is
spoken. It is also where the Castanedas go on many holidays and
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Richard and Christina Castaneda grew up poor in San Antonio but
in the comfort of their own kind, they said. ``The best enchiladas
are made with welfare cheese,'' Castaneda said. He remembers his
childhood world as giving him little sense that he was part of a
minority.
</P>
<P>
   Where he grew up in San Antonio, in the 1950s and '60s,
everybody around him was like him, he said. The barber and the
butcher were Mexican-American. So were the sales clerks downtown.
There were Mexican-American elected officials all over the place,
even a congressman, Henry B. Gonzalez. Castaneda says he even
thought as a child that because there were so many
Mexican-Americans, they must be above both blacks and Anglos at
least a notch.
</P>
<P>
   That view had to change with time, but he remembers thinking
that if Anglos really were the dominant group in the city,
Mexican-Americans definitely came in second. A pool in a public
park had been open to whites and Mexicans, but not to blacks. The
fanciest movie theater in town, the Majestic, had a back entrance
for the ``colored.'' That meant blacks, not Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was the occasional incident to remind him of Anglo
attitudes toward Mexicans. Once, in 10th grade, when he and the
only black student in his class were talking, the teacher snapped,
``I don't want to hear any comments from the colored gallery.''
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda remembers wondering, ``What are you talking about?''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until he had left home, though, that he felt the full
force of prejudice, he said. When he was in the Navy for two years,
in the late 1960s, blacks had been as bad as whites in making his
life miserable, he said. They called him spic, half-breed, pancho.
They harassed him when he spoke Spanish. He had expected to be a
radio man. Instead, he said, ``I washed dishes for eight months''
on a ship carrying 500 men.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a perception of me like the lazy Mexican,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such treatment only fed his resolve that his children would
never endure the same. Unlike Smith, Castaneda was determined that
his son and daughter would live in the Anglo mainstream. They could
have a sense of their Mexican heritage, he said, but first they
were American. He did not want them to be harassed for speaking
Spanish. ``I thought the opportunities were better if my kids were
raised completely American,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda said he resented being asked whether he considered
himself Mexican or American. ``People keep trying to put me in a
situation where I have to choose between one culture and the
other,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And it grates on him when people assume he is from Mexico _ when
he is asked about soccer and even flamenco. He said he had
ancestors who were born in Texas when much of it belonged to
Mexico, in the early 19th century. Yet people will ask him, ``When
did your family come to this country?''
</P>
<P>
   ``And then you start talking to them and you find out their
grandfather came here in 1910. But they consider themselves real
Americans because they're white.''
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda finds little in common with Mexican immigrants or
foreign-born Hispanics. He recalls his father saying, ``Trust only
your own kind.'' But a City Council election five years ago
underscored for him the fallacy of wearing ethnic blinders. Most
Latino Democratic voters supported the Cuban-American candidate,
Orlando Sanchez, against a white Democrat, even though Sanchez was
a conservative Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez turned out to oppose affirmative action. Born in Cuba
and raised in Houston, Sanchez, 42, said Latinos should not be
expected to behave as one. ``I see Hispanics getting together on
global issues _ if the police are singling us out, if banking
institutions are denying us home loans,'' he said. ``But we won't
be a cohesive force like African-Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the priorities of the American- and foreign-born
Hispanics are starkly different. Once, Castaneda said, a Nicaraguan
acquaintance asked him to make a donation to buy a bulletproof car
for the new president of Nicaragua. He chose not to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let them shoot him,'' Castaneda said, ``I don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   And he laments that the image of Mexican-Americans has become
tied to that of the penniless immigrant crossing the border
illegally. ``That's what keeps the image of the Mexican-American
down,'' Castaneda said. He said he finds more in common with black
and Anglo native Texans than the ``wetbacks,'' a term that
sometimes slips into his conversation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, he has begun to have second thoughts about his decision
to Americanize his children so completely that neither ever learned
to speak Spanish. Now that the country has become increasingly
multicultural, he said, ``it's an advantage'' to be bilingual.
``I've actually done them a disservice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His children came to recognize a need to embrace their heritage.
As adults they both migrated to San Antonio, back to where their
cousins and grandparents live and where they spent summers as
children. Last year, Castaneda's daughter, Denise Ramirez, 27,
married a Mexican-American, Gerardo Ramirez _ and not only for
love, she said, but for their shared Hispanic values.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I have a pretty good grasp on my culture,'' said
Ramirez, a public school social worker. ``I'm really proud of it.
So was my brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Her brother, Ricardo Cristian, known as Cris, was killed in
December at the age of 24. He had been driving home after a hockey
game when his new red pickup truck went off the road and into an
embankment.
</P>
<P>
   The previous May he had earned a bachelor's degree in technology
from his father's alma mater, the University of Houston, and had
taken a construction management job with a San Antonio firm.
</P>
<P>
   While packing up his belongings after the death, his family
found a Spanish-language instructional tape in the stereo. In his
wallet, his mother said, they found a list of things he was looking
for in a wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hispanic,'' he had written at the top.
</P>
<P>
   A CALCULATED MOVE PAYS OFF
</P>
<P>
   After Lee Brown was elected, Richard Lewis attended a meeting of
the Houston Contractors Association, the mostly white group he had
led some years back. He was confident that he had done the right
thing by supporting Brown, he remembers, but he was also feeling
betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Through his support for Lee Brown, Lewis had wanted his
contractors' group to benefit, he said. He had wanted them at least
to hedge their bets by staying neutral and giving money to both
candidates. But when the association's political action committee
decided to endorse Mosbacher and Lewis stood his ground, the
committee stripped him of the chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't eat or sleep for days,'' Betty Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis did not resign from the association; he was still dead set
against affirmative action, and the group carried that banner. It
had even filed a lawsuit against it. He also knew, he said, that
his ties with the Brown administration would be fleeting. Brown is
now in his second two-year term and by law can serve only one more.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment Lewis was in and his fellow contractors were
out, and he did not want them to forget it.
</P>
<P>
   At the association's meeting that day, Lewis waited for someone
to acknowledge the results of the vote. Finally, he recalls,
someone said: ```Well, Richard, I guess you were right. I know that
you won't have a grudge and that if we need your help, you'll be
there for us.'''
</P>
<P>
   Without a word, Lewis stood up and unbuttoned his shirt to
reveal a T-shirt. It showed a cartoon character with a lipstick
mark on its buttocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' he said, ``was my answer.''
</P>
<P>
   More than two years later, Lewis is no less confident that he
did the right thing. Indeed, Lewis, Castaneda and Smith all say
they have no complaints about how the mayor has treated them.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of their connections to the Brown
administration, ties that were forged during the 1997 campaign, the
three were selected to join a team of industry professionals
competing for a $100 million contract to build the Northeast Water
Purification Project. The team is led by a group of private
companies that also chose the men because they brought racial
diversity to the table. Though the project is not subject to
affirmative action regulations because it is being built with
private money, it will still need to obtain approval from the city,
the plant's client, and the City Council is made up of blacks,
whites, Latinos and one Asian-American. In this case, Castaneda
says, political realities have dictated the need for diversity,
with or without the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Utopia, this is how it should work,'' Castaneda said.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever promise of equal opportunity is embodied in that
team, it is not a reason to scrap affirmative action, he said. Even
with a mixed population and a multi-hued council to represent it,
he said, there would be no guarantee that minority companies would
be given a fair shake in an industry still dominated by Anglo-owned
companies. And in politics, he said, even a minority leader could
be bought or could enter into an alliance out of self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can leave it up to people's judgment,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, Smith and Castaneda all agree that one of Brown's
legacies will be the way he has led minorities, not just blacks,
into government. But a looming question is how well the minority
alliances that got him elected will survive the big demographic
changes that are expected. Brown came to power in a city in which
the Anglo, black and Hispanic populations had reached a rough
parity. But Texas demographers say that he happened to catch the
moment when these three groups, moving at different speeds or in
different directions, were passing one another on the population
charts.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1960, whites made up 70 percent of the city's
population, blacks 23 percent and Hispanics 7 percent. By 1997,
whites were 35 percent, blacks 28 and Hispanics 31. By 2030, it is
projected, Latinos will account for more than 50 percent of the
population of Harris County, which includes Houston. Whites,
meanwhile, will dip to 21 percent and blacks to 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the growing Hispanic numbers will translate into power
at the polls is uncertain. In the 1997 election, only 13 percent of
the turnout was Latino, compared with 32 percent black and 52
percent Anglo.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever movement there is toward greater Hispanic power,
Lewis is not troubled by it. He said he did not know many whites
who fretted about their shrinking numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not concerned about it as long as green controls,'' he
said. ``They're the establishment. That's the establishment you
have to blend with, and if you're not going to blend, you're not
going to be accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   If one prospect is a kind of assimilation, as Lewis envisions,
and another is continued ethnic divisions, as others predict, yet
another is long-term coalitions, which Castaneda said he hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If the blacks and Hispanics made a coalition, they could do a
lot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To Smith, blacks may have achieved power at City Hall just in
time to hand it over to Latinos. ``At some point, we are not going
to be able to get a black mayor,'' he said. ``I hope we'll have a
Hispanic mayor that we can trust to be inclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   A more immediate issue is the fate of affirmative action. Some
city officials see it as a stabilizing force, but with lawsuits
pending, opponents like Lewis expect a court to strike down the
city law any day. Already, the Brown administration has endorsed
two new race- and gender-neutral contracting programs.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he was more afraid of an economic downturn than the
demise of affirmative action. With the numbers of people in
minority groups increasing, he said, demands for parity are likely
to increase, and ``we'll be more and more protected.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, he is exploring investing in a restaurant chain.
And he said he was in talks with African entrepreneurs in Chad for
what would be his first international construction management
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and Castaneda see a different picture, one without
affirmative action. But while Lewis is pleased by that prospect,
Castaneda is resigned to it. He said it would force him to reassess
his options.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing business without it would be too uncertain,'' he said.
``I still don't see the private work out there.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would probably close his doors without the government
work and do something else: go back to school, maybe study
environmental law, or move his business to San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   When the time comes for the men to cash in or retire, they plan
to retreat to their separate worlds. The Castanedas think of moving
permanently to a lakeside home near San Antonio and their son's
grave. Lewis plans to live at least part of the time in Matagorda.
Only Smith feels rooted in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The three have made a living in the same arena, sometimes
helping each other get jobs, sometimes coming together out of
mutual interest. But outside that arena, they said, they were not
sure whether they would have any reason to see one another again.
</P>
<P>
   Most relationships outside the family are superficial anyway,
Castaneda said.
</P>
<P>
   And though Houston has made him feel ``95 percent comfortable''
around other ethnic groups, he said, there is that remaining 5
percent, which he calls distrust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they're watching what they say,'' Castaneda said of
Lewis and Smith, ``because under normal circumstances, they could
be saying something insensitive towards me.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who views opposition to affirmative action as racist,
said he had nothing in common with Lewis except their support for a
mayoral candidate. He said he felt closer to Castaneda.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewis says friendship is not the point; tolerance is _
``where we don't have this open hostility toward one another.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You work together well; we treat each other civilly,'' he
said. ``We send each other work.
</P>
<P>
   ``How close are we supposed to be?''

U.S. CHILDREN BORN WITH HIV NOW REACHING TEEN YEARS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LEIGH HOPPER 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ Of the estimated 10,000 children living
in the United States born with HIV due to mother-to-infant
infection, approximately 2,400 are now teen-agers, according to a
new report presented Tuesday at the 13th International AIDS
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say these youngsters, some of whom have been taking 15
to 17 pills a day for much of their lives, are poised to do the
things teens do: rebel, and become sexually active.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something very few centers planned for,'' said Dr. Mark
Kline, a pediatric AIDS specialist at Texas Children's Hospital,
who is attending the conference. ``I view it as a kind of good
problem to have.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of children born to HIV-infected women in the U.S.
increased rapidly in the 1980s and then plateaued in the early
1990s, according to the study from the national Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. Successful anti-HIV drugs, which became
available in the mid-1990s, have allowed more infected children in
the United States and Western Europe to reach adolescence, said
lead author Dr. Mary Lou Lindegren of the CDC.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said these youngsters need prevention strategies
specifically targeted at them: family planning, education about
sexual health and how to protect themselves and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this population, the earlier, the better,'' Lindegren
said. ``They're approaching their sexual debut _ we have an
opportunity to intervene early. Waiting until they are 13 is too
long.''
</P>
<P>
   Kline, who has many such patients in his practice, said frank
conversations with patients about sexuality, partner notification,
substance abuse and condom use are imperative.
</P>
<P>
   He strongly advises patients against sexual activity, stressing
that it's better to wait ``until they are ready for a longer,
monogamous relationship with a partner who knows their infection
status.'' Because some will probably become sexually active anyway,
he makes sure patients understand how the virus is spread,
dispelling myths such as that HIV can't be spread by oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   The second issue facing children with HIV is adhering to their
daily drug regimen. Some of the protease inhibitors, which block
the virus's ability to reproduce, are nearly an inch long and
unpleasant to take. Kline said children can be ``resourceful'' in
figuring out ways to avoid taking the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of the anti-HIV drug saquinavir, six out of 25
children failed the therapy and the level of HIV in their blood
remained high. Upon investigation, Kline discovered that five of
the six barely had any of the drug in their blood at all. When he
questioned the patients and their parents, he learned some of the
youngsters had been creative: One patient fed his pills to the
family dog, another stuffed them under cushions, and another child
flushed her pills down the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   The obstacles increase as patients reach their teens. Kline said
young patients who have always been cooperative about taking their
medicine suddenly balk. And when they don't take the drugs, they
become sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's heartbreaking. . . . They want to fit in and anything
that sets them apart is bad,'' Kline said. ``This is not unique to
HIV. The juvenile diabetic is a classic one.''
</P>
<P>
   A related CDC study of data from a biennial youth survey
suggested that sexual risk behavior in teens is declining,
reversing an upward trend in sexual intercourse among adolescents
during the 1970s and 1980s. Between 1991 and 1999, condom use
increased from 46.2 percent to 58 percent among high school
students. The percentage of 14- to 18-year-olds who reported having
sex declined from 54.1 percent to 49.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There was a 16 percent decrease in the number of teens reporting
four or more sexual partners in a lifetime. CDC researchers
attributed the declines to broad-based prevention efforts.

POLICE FIND MORE THAN 50 AT INTERNET-ORGANIZED S&AMP;M CLUB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATTLEBORO, Mass. _ They wore leather, studs, and not much else.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 people from all over New England paid $25 to enter
a taboo world, where they sought sexual pleasure in the form of
spankings, domination, bondage, and taunts.
</P>
<P>
   One woman bent over as another flogged her with a wooden
spatula. Their leader _ the so-called ``dungeon master'' _ watched
over the group, to keep the sadomasochism club members in line.
</P>
<P>
   Since February, police say, the group met regularly in a room on
the fourth-floor of a former tool &AMP; dye mill in this old mill city
where nighttime attractions are VFW dances and the hot-plate
special at Morin's Diner.
</P>
<P>
   Few knew about the wild times behind door 318 _ above which
read: ``ANGER WITHIN'' _ until it ended Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   That's when police, looking into a report of stolen music
equipment at the converted brick building, stumbled upon the S&AMP;M
club.
</P>
<P>
   They seized whips, chains, paddles, a spiked leather glove, an
S&AMP;M manual and other assorted pain-giving devices. And they charged
two people: the leader and a woman.
</P>
<P>
   The woman's crime? Spanking another woman with a wooden spatula.
</P>
<P>
   Police charged Stefany Reed _ a 38-year-old internet cosmetics
company vice president who lives in Manhattan _ with assault and
battery, even though the woman she ``punished'' consented.
</P>
<P>
   As word of the club and the charges spread, it's cut a quick
divide among those who say S&AMP;M groups should be illegal and others
who say consenting adults should be free to engage in
non-conformist sex acts, as long as no one gets injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I myself don't get spanked or spank. I'm not into it. It's not
my thing,'' said Matt Slobogan, 24, a jazz drummer who rents
practice space at the building. ``But I don't think we should stop
other people from doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   For others who frequent downtown, though, the break-up of the
club is a relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want stuff like that going on in the
neighborhood,'' said Brian, 48, an addiction counselor who asked
that his last name be withheld. ``It attracts other things, like
prostitution and selling drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it was unclear when, or if, the law has been applied to
people involved in S&AMP;M acts in Massachusetts, the case is
proceeding. A pretrial hearing is scheduled for July 26 in
Attleboro District Court.
</P>
<P>
   But some legal specialists question the law itself. ``Speaking
generally, I would caution law enforcement against using criminal
laws to police consensual private adult activities,'' said Jennifer
Levi, staff attorney for Gay &AMP; Lesbian Advocates &AMP; Defenders, an
organization which has studied prosecutions of people who engage in
non-traditional sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laws such as assault and battery should not be relied on as
proxy for enforcing moral judgments about private conduct,'' she
said, adding that she did not know any of the details of the
Attleboro case.
</P>
<P>
   When the police entered the building, they were looking for
guitars, not a sex party. Detectives Timothy Cook and John Otrando
arrived just before 11 p.m. Saturday to investigate the theft of
music equipment from one of the dozens of rooms rented to artists,
musicians and others in the hulking red-brick warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, boards are nailed against the walls, with spray-painted
messages. One reads ``Time heals all.'' In communal bathrooms,
ribbons of aged fly paper hang from the ceiling, dotted with
long-dead insects.
</P>
<P>
   Known as The Foster Building, it sits diagonally across the
street from the Attleboro Police Department. The owner, William
Boots, could not be reached. The property manager did not return
messages.
</P>
<P>
   As the officers climbed the concrete stairs up to the fourth
floor, Cook and Otrando spotted a woman collecting money at a
table, according to court documents. She also had a list of names
and e-mail addresses, leading them to believe partygoers found out
about the get-together via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The detectives then discovered several rooms with between 50 to
60 adults, some completely naked, some halfway there.
</P>
<P>
   Court records indicate that Benjamin Davis, a clean-shaven
23-year-old computer consultant who lives in Hudson, N.H., rented
the rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Police charged him with assaulting Detective Cook, as well as a
number of other charges: exhibiting or lending articles for
self-abuse, keeping a house of ill fame for lewdness, operating
without a ``Doing Business As'' certificate, and eight counts of
carrying a dangerous weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Police also charged him with ``accessory to assault and battery
before the fact'' for commanding Reed to flog a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Reed were released on bail. Neither could be reached
for comment. At the Wellesley company where he works, a
receptionist Tuesday said Davis would be returning to work
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the topic of conversation all over the city, from
coffee shops to those who frequent the converted mill building.
</P>
<P>
   Men attending an alcohol recovery program in a downstairs space
known as ``The Bottom Line'' joked outside the building.
</P>
<P>
   One man, who did not want to give his full name because he's in
treatment, feigned disappointment. ``When I found out,'' said Bob
K. ``I was like, `Why wasn't I invited?' ''

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A summit meeting that brings about a real
termination of the Arab-Israel conflict would command the broadest
backing in the state of Israel. Such a long-term quest certainly
motivated Menachem Begin, when he sat with Anwar Sadat of Egypt and
President Jimmy Carter at the first Camp David summit more than 20
years ago. The peace they made removed Egypt from the circle of
conflict with Israel, and marked the first step in ending the
generations-long conflict between Arabs and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Sadat stood in the Knesset in 1977, and declared ``no more
wars.'' While he was a tough negotiator, he refused to use violence
or the threat of violence to advance his position.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, today's Camp David summit is very different.
Yasser Arafat has never made any such conciliatory move toward
peace. Since the signing of the 1993 Oslo accords, Arafat's
language and actions have provided evidence that his intentions
remain hostile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We remind (the Israelis) of al-Karameh battle, the Beirut
battle and the seven years of intifada,'' he said last month,
referring to violent Palestinian actions against Israel. ``If they
don't like it, we will scratch the past and begin anew. Palestine
is ours, ours, ours!''
</P>
<P>
   The summit this week is being held with dire predictions of
violence should it fail. ``We are warning the Israeli generals that
Palestinian blood is not cheap,'' said Freih Abu Medein, the
justice minister of the Palestinian Authority. ``If Israel wishes
that the Middle East be destroyed so be it.'' This is not a way to
negotiate peace.
</P>
<P>
   At the first Camp David summit, Israel gave up Sinai, but it
remained protected by a 120-mile demilitarized zone should Egypt
ever change its mind about peace.
</P>
<P>
   At the current summit, Israel is being called upon to concede
its vital strategic buffer, especially in the Jordan Valley, and to
withdraw from 90 percent of the West Bank, precisely at a time in
which the Western alliance has failed to maintain the monitoring of
Iraq, which is only 250 miles to the east and has engaged Israel in
four wars.
</P>
<P>
   What security protections will Israel receive in return? Its
``compensation'' will be billions of dollars in American military
aid, which will only leave Israel more dependent on the United
States than ever, and more beholden to the wishes of the White
House and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the most glaring difference between the two Camp David
peace talks relates to Jerusalem. There are certain values on which
a nation is built that are simply not for sale. Menachem Begin
would not have put Jerusalem on the negotiating table; he would not
have traded a few neighborhoods for more tanks and missiles from
his superpower ally. Yet Prime Minister Ehud Barak has already
turned neighborhoods in Jerusalem over to Palestinian rule, and has
indicated in negotiations leading up to Camp David that much more
would be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Barak's singular purpose should not be to reach an
agreement for its own sake. This only erodes Israel's negotiating
position. Nor should he be seduced by American offers of increased
aid. Israel needs a unified Jerusalem and defensible borders far
more than its needs more foreign money.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Barak must preserve Israel's internal cohesion.
Thomas Jefferson said that ``large initiatives cannot rest upon
slender majorities.'' Menachem Begin took consensus-building into
account. When he departed for Camp David, he had the support of the
overwhelming majority of the Knesset. Barak left for Camp David as
the head of a minority government, having barely survived a
no-confidence vote in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Barak continues to glibly ignore the opposition, contending
that his election last year is enough of a mandate to sign a peace
accord on his nation's behalf. The Clinton administration has
supported Barak's stance. Yet dismissing the Knesset is like
dismissing the U.S. Congress, on the grounds that the president is
directly elected by the American people.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, peace must be built on national consensus, which
includes the preservation of Israel's core values. Even this sort
of peace involves risk, but it is the only kind of risk that Israel
should take.
</P>
<P>

Likud Party and served in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's

   LEXINGTON, Mass. _ Parents of children involved in organized
sports may be tempted to think that the tragedy in suburban Boston
last week, when a fight between two hockey dads turned fatal, has
nothing to do with them. We'll tell ourselves that an event like
that has more to do with the individuals involved than with youth
sports in general.
</P>
<P>
   But marginalizing the episode at the Reading, Mass., ice rink is
just a convenient way to deflect troublesome concerns before they
creep too close. Sideline parents are quite familiar with the
syndrome of getting worked up at their kids' sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   Watching your child compete is a singularly wrenching
experience. Nobody is immune from bad behavior. I have watched in
disgust as some jerk lambastes a hapless 8-year-old (``Use your
left foot!''), only minutes later to hear myself howling an equally
pointless rant (``Watch the ball!'').
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the topic of bad sideline behavior arises, it is often
dismissed as a situation that has always been with us. Many
parents, especially fathers, seek another shot at thwarted glory
through their children.
</P>
<P>
   But something different is at work these days, whatever the
special circumstances of last week's confrontation, and it's
becoming severe.
</P>
<P>
   Over-the-top parental intensity does not have to turn fatal to
be seen for what it clearly is: adults intruding on children's
games. People who might previously have viewed sports as little
more than an extracurricular activity are buying into the more
serious notion that sports is a metaphor for success. From the glib
homilies of the basketball coach Pat Riley and other jock
proselytizers to the sports analogies used by high-flying corporate
chiefs to explain upticks on the Nasdaq, the culture is awash in
the notion that these are more than mere games.
</P>
<P>
   The message, unwittingly accepted by too many parents, is that a
child's success or failure on the playing field is somehow a
meaningful indicator of his or her potential to do well in life.
Any suggestion that life is a far broader experience than can be
neatly contained in a win-lose paradigm gets swept aside.
</P>
<P>
   Few parents, of course, are so deluded as to believe that their
child is preparing for the Olympics or the major leagues, but when
they speak openly of how youth sports build winners by inculcating
drive and guts and perseverance, they are projecting forward to the
world of adult achievement. That is one large burden to place on
what might otherwise be casual games.
</P>
<P>
   It is my fear that the tragedy at the suburban Boston ice rink
involved two dads who in their zeal to do right by their sons
simply forgot what youth sports are all about _ children acquiring
skills that enable them to have fun and to enjoy life more. This
ought to be plenty, for child and parent alike.
</P>

sports.)

US ENVOY TO SOUTH KOREA TO HEAD DIPLOMACY SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The US ambassador to South Korea is stepping down to
become dean of Tufts University's Fletcher School of Law and
Diplomacy, the school confirmed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen W. Bosworth, a career diplomat who previously was
ambassador to Tunisia and to the Philippines, was appointed to the
top job in Seoul in 1997, before which he was deeply involved in
efforts to lower tensions surrounding North Korea's nuclear power
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Bosworth, 60, also was chairman of the board of Dartmouth
College, of which he is a graduate.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment, which takes effect in February, was mentioned
informally at the Fletcher School's commencement in late May but no
announcement was made at the request of Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright and Bosworth, acting dean Joel P. Trachtman
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was not to prejudice his ability to deal with the
issues of the Korean Peninsula,'' Trachtman said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the school mailed its 5,000 alumni letters from
Peter Ackerman, chairman of its board of overseers, informing them
of the identity of the new dean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the sensitive international negotiations the
dean-designate is involved in, we cannot release his name beyond
the Fletcher community,'' Ackerman wrote in the letter, which was
dated June 2000 but not received by some alumni until this week.
</P>
<P>
   Trachtman, who was a member of the committee that chose
Bosworth, said Bosworth was selected because he ``understands what
a school of international relations needs to be, understands
private sector topics, NGO (non-governmental organization) topics,
and knows the problems of education generally.'' Citing Bosworth's
service at Dartmouth, Trachtman said, ``He knows what tenure cases
look like, he knows what budgets look like.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fletcher School, in suburban Medford, offers graduate-level
programs in international relations and law.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials and South Korea's embassy in
Washington seemed taken by surprise at the change, which comes at a
time when communist North Korea and democratic South Korea, long
frozen in an enmity of Cold War-vintage, finally are taking steps
toward reconciliation. South Korea's President Kim Dae Jung and his
North Korean counterpart, Kim Jong Il, recently met in Pyongyang,
and expanded business and personal exchanges across their highly
fortified boundary are in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any information about his resigning,'' said a
State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity and
suggested that a reporter contact the embassy in Seoul and speak
with Bosworth directly. ``The ambassador's plans are his to make,''
the official said.
</P>
<P>
   At South Korea's mission in Washington, minister for political
affairs Myung Hwan Yu said the embassy had not been officially
notified of the resignation, and therefore would make no comment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his three ambassadorial appointments, Bosworth
has served as the State Department's director of policy planning
and as deputy assistant secretary for both economic affairs and
inter-American affairs. Outside government, he was president of the
US-Japan Foundation, and taught international relations at Columbia
University, in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his most delicate, and potentially dangerous, assignment
_ as executive director of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development
Organization _ immediately preceeded his appointment to Seoul. In
that job, he directed the startup and initial operation of an
organization that is constructing two nuclear power plants in North
Korea and delivering 500,000 tons of fuel oil to the North annually
in return for the dismantling of North Korea's nuclear-weapons
capability.

SERIOUS TALK, BUT NO BIG DEVELOPMENTS EXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the annals of summitry, an unscripted moment
Tuesday at Camp David may be remembered for ages.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton had already entered Laurel Cottage at the
Maryland retreat. As Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat approached the doorway, each
tried to step aside so the other could enter.
</P>
<P>
   Neither budged. They planted their feet. They pretended to
wrestle like miniature, aging Sumo warriors. With an international
television audience watching live, the longer it went the easier it
was to see child's play become a matter of national honor. Who was
mightier? Israeli or Palestinian?
</P>
<P>
   Then, a laughing Clinton, the man who hopes to be peacemaker,
opened the double doors and the two leaders strolled in together,
smiling.
</P>
<P>
   For the president and the peoples of the Middle East, they can
only hope that the moment turns out to be a foreshadowing of things
to come, that after some tussling in the negotiations, Barak and
Arafat walk out together with a deal done.
</P>
<P>
   This is a critical moment in the long history of war over who
controls the Holy Land. No matter the outcome, the stakes loom
large. But, say many onlookers, expectations should be in line with
the history of the nine years of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations,
starting with the Madrid Conference in 1991. That foreshadows
incremental movement, not a blockbuster deal.
</P>
<P>
   It means that a conflicting reality envelopes these talks that
were hastily called by Clinton: The summit itself is historic
because the leaders of the Israelis and Palestinians are finally
addressing the most serious issues that have separated them for 52
years of conflict, but not many expect the talks to make history.
</P>
<P>
   Before the discussions began Tuesday, Clinton himself placed the
talks in the context of previous negotiations of Middle East peace,
starting with the Israeli-Egyptian pact that grew out of Camp David
in 1978, ``to Madrid, to Oslo, to the first handshake on the lawn
between Prime Minister (Yitzhak) Rabin and Chairman Arafat, to the
peace between Israel and Jordan, and the agreement at Wye River.''
</P>
<P>
   But after such a long list of deals, how far have the Israelis
and the Arabs come? Some look at it in the historic context, saying
that the reality today of a framework of peace deals was
unthinkable in the months after the 1967 and 1973 wars.
</P>
<P>
   Others see it through the prism of day-to-day life. For
Palestinians, that outlook is grim, considering the paucity of jobs
and economic opportunities and the vastly unequal footing between
them and their Israeli neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   These talks are about core issues for the entire Middle East:
Who controls Jerusalem, a spiritual center for Muslims, Jews and
Christians? What happens to the 3 million Palestinian refugees
living in exile? If a Palestinian state is declared, what are its
borders? What are its powers? What happens to the 170,000 Jewish
settlers have built permanent housing on land deeded to Palestinian
families?
</P>
<P>
   All this to be decided in seven days at Camp David?
</P>
<P>
   Hanan M. Ashrawi, who has participated in past Palestinian
negotiations and now has taken the role as one of Arafat's
spokespeople, said Tuesday that such a short time frame was either
a ``last-ditch attempt or heroic or a foolhardy attempt.''
</P>
<P>
   She clearly was worried about the last alternative coming true.
She also sounded a warning that the Palestinians weren't going to
be pushed around, that they wouldn't cave to ``the politics of
panic,'' a coda that says a deal must be done now or the
opportunity is lost forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is what are the positions being adopted by the
sides concerned, and what role does the US envisage for itself, and
what kind of clout or pressure can it exercise _ not just on the
Palestinians, which is a historical habit ... (while) the Israelis
get away with the carrots,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   By that, she meant the Clinton administration may be a fair
broker in the negotiations, but it also must dole out a peace
dividend to both.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obstacles and the short time frame, there has been
an historic shift in one important dynamic leading up to the talks:
Both sides now have made it a priority to tackle the so-called
final status issues _ Jerusalem, borders, statehood, settlers.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have always favored such an approach, while the
Israelis have resisted it. But now, with Barak's governing
coalition in pieces, it seems in his interest to pull together a
larger package than a smaller one.
</P>
<P>
   All three leaders' needs aren't that complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Barak needs the Palestinians to end their historic conflict, a
united Jerusalem, a big US aid package, Israel's security intact
and most Jewish settlements remaining in place. Arafat needs a
legitimate state, a piece of Jerusalem, some settlers out and US
and international money.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton? ``He just needs people smiling at the end of
this,'' said Geoffrey Aronson, head of the Foundation for Middle
East Peace, a Washington think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Just like they smiled Tuesday going into Laurel Cottage. The
pictures a week from now will tell the story.

   THURMONT, Md. _ Setting his sights on securing ``a just and
enduring'' peace in the fractious Middle East, President Clinton
opened high stakes negotiations Tuesday between Israeli and
Palestinian leaders at the secluded presidential retreat where a
landmark accord was reached two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking off the talks with a stroll through the rolling
woodlands of Camp David, Clinton and his guests _ Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat _ smiled
at reporters and shared light conversation on their way to the
brick-and-clapboard lodge where negotiations began.
</P>
<P>
   In a light-hearted sign of the tensions between them, Barak and
Arafat started off with a brief but animated exchange over who
should enter the Laurel lodge first. Each tried to defer to the
other.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Arafat wagged his finger at Barak, tripping off a
bit of mutual backslapping and arm-tugging before Barak followed
Arafat through the doorway.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton looked on laughing from inside the lodge, where the
three leaders and senior aides met for half an hour before breaking
up into smaller groups for sessions that stretched into the night.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides, meanwhile, shrugged off the diplomatic
slapstick.
</P>
<P>
   ``They greeted each other in a very friendly way,'' White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere is good, and the mood is serious,'' he said.
``I felt that they were both here on a serious attempt to make
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   As he left the White House Tuesday aboard Marine One for the
half-hour flight to Camp David _ the secluded presidential retreat
in the cool, green Catoctin Mountains five miles from this western
Maryland town _ Clinton stopped short of predicting success.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he warned that ``profound and wrenching questions,''
must be settled during what promise to be up to a week of grinding
talks centered on a slate of contentious issues at the core of a
half-century of war and enmity between Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues include the question of Palestinian statehood,
borders, the future of Jerusalem and the extent to which millions
of Palestinian refugees may return to former homelands controlled
by Israel since the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.
</P>
<P>
   As he has stressed in the past, Clinton reiterated that neither
side should expect a clean win on all issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no success without principled compromise,''
Clinton said in his White House departure remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton expressed hope, though, that this week would lead to a
breakthrough settlement that he and his predecessors have sought
for decades in the region that is home to three of the world's
great religions and two-thirds of the known crude oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an opportunity to bring about a just and enduring end
to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,'' said Clinton, who planned to
spend the night at Camp David. ``That is the key to lasting peace
in the entire Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called last week for the talks, saying negotiators for
both sides had reached an impasse that has ground the peace process
to a dangerous stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   Building on that theme, he warned the parties Tuesday against
believing that time was on their side, or that either one might
improve their negotiating prospects by stalling or by kicking
painful decisions down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have passed the point of no return,'' Clinton said. ``The
only way forward now is forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hopes to tie up in the coming days a marathon diplomatic
undertaking set in motion at Camp David in 1978, when President
Jimmy Carter brokered a breakthrough peace accord between Israeli
Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement called for Israel and the Palestinians to resolve
their outstanding disputes over the next five years, an objective
Clinton hopes to attain before he leaves July 19 for the annual
Group of Eight summit in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In a twist, Barak is staying in the Dogwood cottage, where Sadat
stayed during the 13-day summit 22 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is holed up in the Birch cottage, where Israeli leader
Begin stayed in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The weight of history fell with a thud here on this 18th-Century
crossroads at the foot of the Catoctin Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The town's 4,400 residents have grown used to seeing
presidential motorcades whiz up and down its otherwise quiet
streets. They've even accepted the inconvenience of having Clinton
take over the Maple Run golf course at the edge of town, once a
dairy farm and source of pancake syrup from the sugar maple trees
that still abound in these parts.
</P>
<P>
   This week, though, the town is inundated with more than 300
members of the international press corps, as well as scores of
high-level White House aides, presidential security teams and U.S.,
Israeli and Palestinian diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Many townsfolk voiced pessimism about the prospects for a
comprehensive peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, that war's been going on forever ain't it,''
said 24-year-old Jeremy Hahn, who served four years in the U.S.
Marine Corps before returning to Thurmont to cut hair _ $7 for a
flat top _ in his dad's barber shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we're going to do is give 'em more money, they'll go back
there and shoot each other,'' Hahn said. ``That's the way I see
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat arrived at 1 a.m. (ET) at Camp David, where he was
greeted by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Barak
arrived five hours later, also welcomed by Albright.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:30 a.m. (ET), the president arrived, met briefly with top
Middle East aides, then met for about 40 minutes with Arafat on the
back porch of Clinton's lodge, the Aspen cottage. After Arafat
left, Clinton met for nearly an hour, in the same spot, with Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Strolling in between his Middle East guests along a pathway
through the wooded presidential retreat Tuesday afternoon, Clinton
smiled at reporters but refused to answer questions, in keeping
with the news blackout the parties agreed upon to prevent media
leaks from
</P>
<P>
   spoiling the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pledged to each other we would answer no questions and
offer no comment,'' a smiling Clinton said. ``I'd like to set a
good example.''

   MIDEAST-TALKS (Thurmont, Md.) _ Ledeall: In the verdant hills of
Maryland, the Israeli and Palestinian leaders began their fateful
peace summit at Camp David with the far-reaching, most think
improbable, goal of ending their 52-year-old conflict. On the first
day of an open-ended, secluded meeting, President Clinton ushered
Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat into the presidential retreat where he hopes that the
chemistry of the place can induce a spirit of ``principled
compromise'' that yields a substantive peace agreement. By Deborah

   THURMONT, Md. _ Setting his sights on securing ``a just and
enduring'' peace in the fractious Middle East, President Clinton
opened high stakes negotiations Tuesday between Israeli and
Palestinian leaders at the secluded presidential retreat where a
landmark accord was reached two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking off the talks with a stroll through the rolling
woodlands of Camp David, Clinton and his guests _ Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat _ smiled
at reporters and shared light conversation on their way to the
brick-and-clapboard lodge where negotiations began.
</P>
<P>
   In a light-hearted sign of the tensions between them, Barak and
Arafat started off with a brief but animated exchange over who
should enter the Laurel lodge first. Each tried to defer to the
other.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Arafat wagged his finger at Barak, tripping off a
bit of mutual backslapping and arm-tugging before Barak followed
Arafat through the doorway.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton looked on laughing from inside the lodge, where the
three leaders and senior aides met for half an hour before breaking
up into smaller groups for sessions that stretched into the night.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides, meanwhile, shrugged off the diplomatic
slapstick.
</P>
<P>
   ``They greeted each other in a very friendly way,'' White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere is good, and the mood is serious,'' he said.
``I felt that they were both here on a serious attempt to make
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   As he left the White House Tuesday aboard Marine One for the
half-hour flight to Camp David _ the secluded presidential retreat
in the cool, green Catoctin Mountains five miles from this western
Maryland town _ Clinton stopped short of predicting success.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he warned that ``profound and wrenching questions,''
must be settled during what promise to be up to a week of grinding
talks centered on a slate of contentious issues at the core of a
half-century of war and enmity between Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues include the question of Palestinian statehood,
borders, the future of Jerusalem and the extent to which millions
of Palestinian refugees may return to former homelands controlled
by Israel since the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.
</P>
<P>
   As he has stressed in the past, Clinton reiterated that neither
side should expect a clean win on all issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no success without principled compromise,''
Clinton said in his White House departure remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton expressed hope, though, that this week would lead to a
breakthrough settlement that he and his predecessors have sought
for decades in the region that is home to three of the world's
great religions and two-thirds of the known crude oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an opportunity to bring about a just and enduring end
to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,'' said Clinton, who planned to
spend the night at Camp David. ``That is the key to lasting peace
in the entire Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called last week for the talks, saying negotiators for
both sides had reached an impasse that has ground the peace process
to a dangerous stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   Building on that theme, he warned the parties Tuesday against
believing that time was on their side, or that either one might
improve their negotiating prospects by stalling or by kicking
painful decisions down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have passed the point of no return,'' Clinton said. ``The
only way forward now is forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hopes to tie up in the coming days a marathon diplomatic
undertaking set in motion at Camp David in 1978, when President
Jimmy Carter brokered a breakthrough peace accord between Israeli
Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement called for Israel and the Palestinians to resolve
their outstanding disputes over the next five years, an objective
Clinton hopes to attain before he leaves July 19 for the annual
Group of Eight summit in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In a twist, Barak is staying in the Dogwood cottage, where Sadat
stayed during the 13-day summit 22 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is holed up in the Birch cottage, where Israeli leader
Begin stayed in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The weight of history fell with a thud here on this 18th-Century
crossroads at the foot of the Catoctin Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The town's 4,400 residents have grown used to seeing
presidential motorcades whiz up and down its otherwise quiet
streets. They've even accepted the inconvenience of having Clinton
take over the Maple Run golf course at the edge of town, once a
dairy farm and source of pancake syrup from the sugar maple trees
that still abound in these parts.
</P>
<P>
   This week, though, the town is inundated with more than 300
members of the international press corps, as well as scores of
high-level White House aides, presidential security teams and U.S.,
Israeli and Palestinian diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Many townsfolk voiced pessimism about the prospects for a
comprehensive peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, that war's been going on forever ain't it,''
said 24-year-old Jeremy Hahn, who served four years in the U.S.
Marine Corps before returning to Thurmont to cut hair _ $7 for a
flat top _ in his dad's barber shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we're going to do is give 'em more money, they'll go back
there and shoot each other,'' Hahn said. ``That's the way I see
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat arrived at 1 a.m. (ET) at Camp David, where he was
greeted by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Barak
arrived five hours later, also welcomed by Albright.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:30 a.m. (ET), the president arrived, met briefly with top
Middle East aides, then met for about 40 minutes with Arafat on the
back porch of Clinton's lodge, the Aspen cottage. After Arafat
left, Clinton met for nearly an hour, in the same spot, with Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Strolling in between his Middle East guests along a pathway
through the wooded presidential retreat Tuesday afternoon, Clinton
smiled at reporters but refused to answer questions, in keeping
with the news blackout the parties agreed upon to prevent media
leaks from
</P>
<P>
   spoiling the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pledged to each other we would answer no questions and
offer no comment,'' a smiling Clinton said. ``I'd like to set a
good example.''

US ENVOY TO SOUTH KOREA TO HEAD DIPLOMACY SCHOOL

<P>
   BOSTON _ The US ambassador to South Korea is stepping down to
become dean of Tufts University's Fletcher School of Law and
Diplomacy, the school confirmed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen W. Bosworth, a career diplomat who previously was
ambassador to Tunisia and to the Philippines, was appointed to the
top job in Seoul in 1997, before which he was deeply involved in
efforts to lower tensions surrounding North Korea's nuclear power
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Bosworth, 60, also was chairman of the board of Dartmouth
College, of which he is a graduate.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment, which takes effect in February, was mentioned
informally at the Fletcher School's commencement in late May but no
announcement was made at the request of Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright and Bosworth, acting dean Joel P. Trachtman
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was not to prejudice his ability to deal with the
issues of the Korean Peninsula,'' Trachtman said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the school mailed its 5,000 alumni letters from
Peter Ackerman, chairman of its board of overseers, informing them
of the identity of the new dean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the sensitive inernational negotiations the
dean-designate is involved in, we cannot release his name beyond
the Fletcher community,'' Ackerman wrote in the letter, which was
dated June 2000 but not received by some alumni until this week.
</P>
<P>
   Trachtman, who was a member of the committee that chose
Bosworth, said Bosworth was selected because he ``understands what
a school of international relations needs to be, understands
private sector topics, NGO (non-governmental organization) topics,
and knows the problems of education generally.'' Citing Bosworth's
service at Dartmouth, Trachtman said, ``He knows what tenure cases
look like, he knows what budgets look like.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fletcher School, in suburban Medford, offers graduate-level
programs in international relations and law.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials and South Korea's embassy in
Washington seemed taken by surprise at the change, which comes at a
time when communist North Korea and democratic South Korea, long
frozen in an enmity of Cold War-vintage, finally are taking steps
toward reconciliation. South Korea's President Kim Dae Jung and his
North Korean counterpart, Kim Jong Il, recently met in Pyongyang,
and expanded business and personal exchanges across their highly
fortified boundary are in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any information about his resigning,'' said a
State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity and
suggested that a reporter contact the embassy in Seoul and speak
with Bosworth directly. ``The ambassador's plans are his to make,''
the official said.
</P>
<P>
   At South Korea's mission in Washington, minister for political
affairs Myung Hwan Yu said the embassy had not been officially
notified of the resignation, and therefore would make no comment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his three ambassadorial appointments, Bosworth
has served as the State Department's director of policy planning
and as deputy assistant secretary for both economic affairs and
inter-American affairs. Outside government, he was president of the
US-Japan Foundation, and taught international relations at Columbia
University, in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his most delicate, and potentially dangerous, assignment
_ as executive director of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development
Organization _ immediately preceeded his appointment to Seoul. In
that job, he directed the startup and initial operation of an
organization that is constructing two nuclear power plants in North
Korea and delivering 500,000 tons of fuel oil to the North annually
in return for the dismantling of North Korea's nuclear-weapons
capability.

<P>
   SREBRENICA, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ Sitting on the grass weeping,
Tima Mehmedovic pointed to the spot where she had last seen her
husband. Five years ago to the day, he was among thousands of men
from Srebrenica who were taken away by Serbian forces and killed in
probably the worst massacre of civilians Europe has witnessed since
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday she was among thousands of Muslim women and a few dozen
men, relatives of the dead or those still missing, who returned to
the site for a memorial service. They came in fleets of buses,
under heavy police protection. Many of them, like Mehmedovic, were
returning to their hometown for the first time since those fateful
days in 1995, when at the height of the war in Bosnia they were
separated from the men, herded on to buses and trucks and deported.
</P>
<P>
   More than 3,500 people attended Tuesday's short prayer service
in the compound of a vacant battery factory, women in traditional
head-scarves and baggy pants mingling with Western diplomats and
United Nations officials. Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian Muslim
leader, also attended, the first high-level Bosnian official to
visit the scene since the war.
</P>
<P>
   Srebrenica represents the darkest days of the war not only for
the Bosnian Muslims, but also for the United Nations and its
troops, whose task had been to safeguard the town, but who failed
in the face of the Serbian onslaught. In recognition of that failed
mission, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan sent a message to the
people of Srebrenica on Tuesday expressing his remorse.
</P>
<P>
   For the Serbs now living in the area, the subject is explosive
and the ceremony was an unwelcome reminder of the world's
opprobrium for the massacre. Srebrenica is now populated only by
Serbs and lies in the Serbian entity within Bosnia, where few
Muslims have dared return since the war.
</P>
<P>
   Townspeople stood on street corners to watch the buses go by and
a few young men made gestures and whistled and jeered. ``They want
to blame the Serbs for everything and want the world to think the
Serbs are bad,'' said Stevo Lazarevic, a car factory worker who
stood with a group of Serbs watching the buses arrive.
</P>
<P>
   But the day passed without any violence. ``We came here, not to
take revenge, not to forgive,'' said Mustafa Ceric, the chief
Muslim cleric in Bosnia, as he led the prayers. ``We are here to
let the world know that we will not abandon our request for
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mehmedovic, a mother of three, it was both frightening and
painful. ``I don't know what I feel, but it's very hard,'' she
said, twisting a handkerchief in her hands. ``I will never forget
this place, but I am afraid of going crazy,'' she said, looking
around tearfully.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, she had sought refuge in the factory compound with her
husband and grown son, along with about 20,000 others, hoping that
the 450 Dutch troops stationed here would ensure their protection.
After two days in the compound, a Serbian soldier allowed her and
her son to get on a truck and leave as her husband was held back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I last saw him standing on the asphalt road there,'' she said,
pointing to the entrance to the compound. ``I do not know what
happened to him. We never found him. We do not know anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of men disappeared during those few days. Hundreds
were separated from their wives and children in front of the Dutch
troops at the compound and were hauled off and executed. Thousands
more tried to escape through the wooded hills to avoid the Serbian
military and make the long trek to Bosnian-controlled territory.
Only a few made it; the vast majority were killed on the way or
captured and then shot in mass executions.
</P>
<P>
   Those buried in mass graves in the area were moved and reburied
in some cases. Many of the men who died in the hills have never
been found.
</P>
<P>
   War crimes investigators have found and exhumed more than 4,000
bodies from sites in the area but have been able to identify only
80, according to Kathryne Bomberger of the International Commission
on Missing Persons. The slow process of identification means that
hundreds or even thousands of relatives are still waiting for news
about their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``This day is shameful for the international community,'' said
Kadira Jusic, a neighbor of Mehmedovic, sitting beside her on the
grass. ``Why did they let them kill us? They were innocent people,
all of them who died. And it's shameful that five years later we
cannot find their bodies,'' she said, her voice sharp, her eyes
brimming with tears.
</P>
<P>
   Reconciliation between Serbs and Muslims remains far off and
plans for refugees to return home remain just that. Only three
Muslims have returned to live in the town of Srebrenica, which is
filled with Serbian refugees from other areas, and they face a
precarious existence. Serbs have set fire to at least four houses
in Srebrenica in the last month, targeting those being prepared for
returning Muslims. Just hours before Tuesday's ceremony another
house was ablaze, that of an old Muslim woman who had been planning
to return home in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Hajrudin Nalic, 45, is one of the three Muslims who have
returned. He reclaimed his flat in May and keeps a low profile,
drinking coffee with the old neighbors he knew from before but not
mixing with the newcomers. ``The first night I was very scared, but
I have not been threatened,'' he said. He has painted the flat and
is planning to bring his wife and two daughters to join him.
``Everyone has to go back to their homes,'' he said.
</P>

   Unemployed and struggling to pay rent in Tuzla, he had decided
to try to come back and reclaim the cafe he used to run in
Srebrenica. Yet a month ago, the cafe was looted, then demolished,
brick by brick. ``I do not take it as a message to leave but I am
not sure if I can manage now,'' he said sadly. ``But I am going to
try. That's why I came.''

 &HT;    Quipster rocker Isaak a TV star-to-be
 &HT;    By Kevin Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Who is Chris Isaak? And more important, why
is Showtime giving him a series?
</P>
<P>
   Those were the first questions on my mind after learning some
minor rock star with cool hair was going to star in his own Larry
Sanders -like show. While I've heard Isaak's sultry ``Baby Did A
Bad Bad Thing'' many times _ how could you miss the commercials for
Stanley Kubrick's ``Eyes Wide Shut?'' _ I never knew it was Isaak
who sang it.
</P>
<P>
   But during his hilarious 30-minute chat with reporters during
the Television Critics Association press tour, I understood why
Showtime likes this guy. Seen-it-all TV critics don't laugh much
during this 21-day conference where the new fall shows, movies and
specials are unveiled. Isaak, however, had us all in stitches. Try
getting a straight answer from him. Good luck. You'll have a better
chance of finding Jimmy Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
   For instance: Chris, how did the show come about?
</P>
<P>
   ``They came to me and said, `Chris, you have relatively little
or no talent... maybe rock 'n' roll wasn't the place for you. Maybe
TV is where you'll be better used.'''
</P>
<P>
   With cameras following you around, is ``The Chris Isaak Show''
jumping on the reality TV craze?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we're not trying to copy or hop on that bandwagon.
Although, every week, we do vote out one member.''
</P>
<P>
   What will your fellow musicians think of the show?
</P>
<P>
   ``The musical community doesn't get cable... they're musicians,
you know. If they see it, they'll go, `How are you here? I just saw
you on TV.'''
</P>
<P>
   OK, we tried.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chris Isaak Show ''debuts in December and will air for 17
weeks. And if Isaak is as quick-witted as he was last weekend,
Showtime could have a hit on its hands. The behind-the-scenes
series promises to take an irreverent look at the sinful,
party-all-the-time world of rock music. Isaak, who plays a
``version'' of himself, his real life band members and a team of
fictional characters will be shadowed by cameras on the road, in
the studio and everywhere in between. Think Big Brother meets
Behind the Music.
</P>
<P>
   The series has writers, but I'm not sure if they're needed. It
would be hard to top Isaak's off-the-cuff riffs. ``He's such a
funny guy,'' says Andrew Schneider, the show's executive producer.
``We just follow him around with a tape recorder. It's the easiest
job we ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to understand why people will compare Isaak's series
to ``The Larry Sanders Show''. But Isaak says that would be a
mistake. ``I don't think we could do his show, or if we tried, we'd
probably fall short,'' says Isaak, sounding serious for the first
time. His somber tone didn't last long, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be more like `The Monkees','' Isaak
says, cutting a devilish smile. ``Only filthy.''

<P>
   JIAXING, China _ Yu Xianglin wants to build a blimp.
</P>
<P>
   He has notebooks filled with drawings of airships that recall
his boyhood fantasies of 50 years ago. He has regulatory
specifications and a business plan.
</P>
<P>
   But after two years of hard work, Yu, 60, remains grounded
because he is a private businessman, something not quite as scarce
as a zeppelin in this officially socialist country, but still rare
where ``capitalist'' is a dirty word.
</P>
<P>
   His most pressing problem is getting a bank loan. The bank
requires a guarantor, almost impossible for a private businessman
to find in China. Even if a private company has a guarantor, most
loans are for only three or four months _ 18 months in exceptional
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not long enough to get a business off the ground,''
said Yu, a portly man dressed in a black Hugo Boss shirt that
matched his jet-black hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really, really tough for private companies in China,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Though this country has been marching famously on the road
toward economic change for more than two decades now, it is far
from the evolving capitalist society that many people in the West
imagine.
</P>
<P>
   The private sector, concentrated on the country's southeastern
coast, remains a small slice of an economy still dominated by
government-owned enterprises. Even China's 800 million ostensibly
independent farmers grow crops on state-owned land and sell grain
to state-owned grain companies.
</P>
<P>
   Private companies, excluding those controlled by foreigners,
accounted last year for less than 20 percent of China's economic
output, and employed fewer than 50 million people in a country of
1.25 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While a sizable gray economy accounts for much hidden private
activity, barriers to raising money keep most private businesses
from providing more than a handful of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   There is growing pressure to change that. Allowing private
companies to absorb the state's excess workers is an obvious way to
improve the Chinese economy, locked in a cycle of bank lending to
the money-losing state-owned enterprises that sustain those
workers.
</P>
<P>
   And officials are beginning to realize that they need people
like Yu for an even more pressing reason rooted in Chinese
nationalism: With World Trade Organization membership expected to
open the domestic market wider to foreign companies in the next
five years, foreigners could take over a huge part of the economy
unless China unleashes private entrepreneurs soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If state-owned enterprises can't perform and there isn't a
viable domestic private sector, the economy will by default become
mostly foreign-owned,'' warned Andy Xie, an economist for Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter in Hong Kong.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Yet entrepreneurs like Yu are systematically shunned by China's
banks, often discriminated against by government regulators and
barred from entering many industries.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference room above the auto repair shop that has already
made him relatively wealthy, Yu said he could sell as many as 90
blimps immediately if he had the money to make them. The expertise
would come from a technical institute in Beijing that has already
made a blimp. And an aircraft factory in Sichuan province has
agreed to build the airframes and engines. Yu has even leased
enough land amid the smokestacks and power lines here south of
Shanghai to assemble two blimps at a time.
</P>
<P>
   He envisioned blimps used for advertising, geological surveys,
even heavy lifting in the country's mountainous west, where the
government plans to build dozens of dams in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   If he does not get started soon, foreign blimp makers will take
the market once the country joins the WTO. Rules barring foreigners
from operating aviation maintenance shops have kept them out of the
market so far.
</P>
<P>
   China's president, Jiang Zemin, laid new foundations for
privatization nearly three years ago by officially redefining state
ownership, the central tenet of China's economy, to include
minority stakes in otherwise private enterprises. Private property
was given constitutional protection the next year.
</P>
<P>
   But ideological inertia still stands in the way. Allowing
capitalists to accumulate capital is anathema to the country's
hard-line Marxists, who fear that a powerful private sector would
erode the Communist Party's power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government doesn't want to develop the private sector;
they just want to use it to help the state-owned economy,'' said
Chen Rong, one of Shanghai's largest private entrepreneurs, who
exudes a seen-it-all air.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, 42, obtained his initial capital from the stock market _
not by issuing shares but by trading shares in the stock market.
Speculation in the country's volatile markets provides seed capital
for many entrepreneurs who have few alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Capital markets are otherwise beyond the reach of most
entrepreneurs because the government bureaucracy favors state-owned
companies. The government holds a majority stake in almost all
companies listed on China's two stock exchanges, in Shanghai and
Shenzhen. And private companies cannot issue bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Chen had hoped to create China's first privately owned financial
services company, and he bought a whole floor of the Shanghai Stock
Exchange building, where he now has a sleek office. But as a
private businessman, he was barred from operating a securities
company or owning a seat on the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he invested in another of his pastimes _ bowling, which
for a while was almost as popular in China as trading shares. He
imported a bowling alley from AMF of the United States, dismantled
it and copied its design. Today, he is China's only manufacturer of
pinspotting machines, which set up bowling pins after they are
knocked down.
</P>
<P>
   At his fanciful factory compound, where spired and crenelated
buildings resemble a low-budget theme park, workers polish
sherbet-colored bowling balls by hand.
</P>
<P>
   Inexpensive labor enables Chen to sell his bowling equipment for
about half what foreign companies charge. But that is about the
only advantage China has offered him in his remarkably successful
competition with multinational giants like Brunswick and AMF.

 &HT;    Cowboys Irvin makes official his retirement
 &HT;    By Ken Sugiura
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - He strutted, preened and ran afoul of the law. He
caught passes, won Super Bowls and played until common sense
dictated he could not play anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe no one stood as a symbol of the success and the reckless
behavior of the 1990s Dallas Cowboys more than Michael Irvin, the
star wide receiver who was both playmaker and troublemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, 34, announced his retirement Tuesday afternoon at Texas
Stadium in Irving, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say goodbye,'' said Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin was one-third of the celebrated Cowboys offensive
triumvirate, with quarterback Troy Aikman and running back Emmitt
Smith, that returned the team to its former glory. The final
first-round pick made in Tom Landry's 29-year tenure as the
Cowboys' coach, Irvin helped raise Dallas from the depths of a 1-15
season in 1989 to three Super Bowl titles, 1992, 1993 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin's season and ultimately his career ended Oct. 10 at
Philadelphia's Veterans Stadium. After catching a pass from Aikman,
Irvin's head slammed into the turf, and he became temporarily
paralyzed. Tests revealed that he had been born with a narrow
spinal column, which put him at greater risk to suffer permanent
paralysis if he sustained another neck injury.
</P>
<P>
   The reception from Aikman was the 750th of his career, tying him
with Hall of Famer Charlie Joiner for ninth in league history.
Irvin finished his 12-year career tied for third with seven
1,000-yard seasons. His 11,904 yards gained rank ninth. He holds
almost every Dallas career and season receiving record.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin's image, though, will extend beyond clutch first-down
catches and gyrating touchdown dances. The trouble he and his
Cowboy teammates found worsened an image problem that the NFL still
is fighting.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Irvin was arrested in a drug bust in a hotel room in
the company of two self-employed models, only to ask the police,
``Can I tell you who I am?''
</P>
<P>
   He pleaded no contest to cocaine possession. On Thursday, Irvin
completed his four years of probation.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin will join Fox Sports Net as an analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad day,'' Irvin said, ``but a great day.''

 &HT;    Professional handymen supplanting the domestic variety
 &HT;    By Stephen J. O'Brien
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas - Like millions of American women these days, Waco
resident Janie Estrada doesn't always turn to her husband when a
man's touch is needed around the house. She often has to call in a
professional.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, she was looking for a few chores done when she
called Jim Jeffery, owner of Waco-based Old Fashioned Services, a
professional handyman business.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband doesn't have time to do a lot of things around the
house,'' Estrada said. ``His work keeps him very busy and it's
convenient to just call someone like Jim and have them come do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the sad story of the near extinction of the domestic
handyman, who once roamed free in his native habitat, the American
homestead, fixing leaky faucets and cleaning stopped-up storm
gutters. Evenings and weekends were a time when the man of the
house donned a tool belt and went about taking care of the things
that make a house a liveable home.
</P>
<P>
   As Estrada can attest, though, times are different in the 21st
century. Busy schedules continue to decimate the last refuge of the
do-it-yourself species: free time. Add to the mix the fact that
people have more disposable income for hiring out professional
help, and you've got the perfect recipe for the eradication of the
domestic handyman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think men know how to fix things as much as they did
back in the old days, but they simply don't have time,'' said Waco
resident John Savage, who has been a professional handym
</P>
<P>
   an for 18 years. ``They have a jillion things to do. They just
don't stay at home anymore. They used to stay around the house on
the weekends with the kids and take care of things, but it's
different now.''
</P>
<P>
   As a construction worker, Estrada's husband easily has the
skills to take care of jobs around the house. But being a
successful builder means staying busy. That's when Jeffery's phone
rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted some things hauled away, but my husband couldn't do
it,'' Estrada said. ``He could do that kind of stuff if he had more
time.''
</P>
<P>
   With fewer handyman husbands, professionals like Savage and
Jeffery have plenty of business. They're called on to trim trees,
clean gutters, repair dishwashers, install stereo systems and, of
course, fix leaky faucets. In the last 20 years, the demand for
professional handymen has expanded the once modest business into a
multimillion-dollar industry nationwide, according to the National
Association of Home Repair Clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffery, who has been a professional handyman for more than 13
years, says most of his clients are either women who don't have a
man around the house or households with men not interested in
getting their fingers dirty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got all kind of clients: retired people, doctors,
lawyers, widows, college kids. You name it,'' Jeffery said. ``I do
all kinds of things - just about any job you can think of other
than building things.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillsboro homeowner Richard Huley, 64, admits the average man
these days probably does less around the house than in previous
decades. His dad used to fix everything himself. Those skills were
passed down, but Huley said it's sometimes too easy to make a phone
call and pay a few extra dollars to have someone else worry about
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think back in the old days people fixed things up themselves
because they didn't have a choice,'' Huley said. ``They didn't have
the money to call someone up every time something broke.''
</P>
<P>
   With disposable income sitting in the bank account, homeowners
like Huley find plumbing projects and other household chores easy
to pass on to hired help, said Bill Augustine, president of the
association of home repair clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of things a homeowner could do, but do you
want to do it?'' Augustine said. ``Is it worth your time? Being
able to do something and wanting to do it are two different
things.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of fix-it-up gumption doesn't mean husbands and dads
aren't breaking sweat around the house, Augustine said.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners who attend fix-it-up classes at the Home Depot in
Waco, for example, learn to take care of little jobs, but most of
do-it-yourself curriculum focuses on big-time projects like
building decks, laying tile and installing kitchen cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We emphasize that we empower people to do things. This is one
way we do that,'' company spokeswoman Mandy Holton said. ``The
courses are very popular. People love to tackle big projects. When
someone comes over to your house, you want to show them something
you've built.''
</P>
<P>
   Fixing a dripping faucet apparently isn't glamorous enough.
</P>
<P>
   Some say it's a study in modern handyman philosophy, a
reflection of a Bob Vila generation hammer-bent on building
colossal decks and embarking on major projects. The old-fashioned
handyman, though, is missing, Augustine said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the old days, you knew how to fix things and if you
didn't your neighbor did,'' he said. ``Somebody around you knew how
to work on plumbing, someone knew about electricity and there was
probably someone nearby who could work on cars. You asked for
advice on how to do things.''
</P>
<P>
   That's left women like Estrada looking for help.
</P>
<P>
   Hireahusband.com is a handyman company based in Dallas where
people can call professionals to take care of domestic repair jobs
once tackled by the man of the house. Waco school teacher Charis
Cavil is a good example. She said her husband, a teacher at Texas
State Technical College, is a good companion and a loving mate, but
when it comes to having a fix-it-up man around the house, she often
turns to the professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband stays pretty busy,'' Cavil said. ``Generally, we're
both pretty busy and when things go wrong we don't have time to fix
it or don't know how.''
</P>
<P>
   With the diminishing population of the domestic repairman has
risen people like Bob Lees, a 72-year-old professional handyman in
the Waco area. The retired engineer repairs electrical and
mechanical household items. He installs sound systems and does a
little painting, too. In the last year and a half he's hung about
200 ceiling fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great percentage of my regular customers are wives of
professional people,'' Lees said. ``(The husbands) don't want to
turn a screwdriver, don't have the time or don't know how.''
</P>
<P>
   Lees has worked for more than 500 homeowners since he started
the ``little'' business four years ago. It likely won't be slowing
down anytime soon, either. More and more people in the Waco area
and across the country feel crunched for time these days, and a
positive economic outlook means that for the foreseeable future,
they're likely to have the money to hire professionals.
</P>
<P>
   It's a promising future if you're in the business of being the
hired man around the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started by working around the neighborhood for ladies who
didn't have anyone to fix things,'' he said. ``It's grown from
there. Now, there's about as much work as I can handle.''

<P>
   Despite its free-market facade, even Shanghai's economy is less
than 10 percent private. Many of the city's chrome and glass
storefronts contain state-owned businesses or joint ventures
between state-owned and foreign companies. Collectives, businesses
owned by local government organizations, make up much of the rest.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, China's official media rarely use the term ``private,''
preferring to call such businesses ``people-operated.''
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party's ambivalence toward the private sector is
evident even in Wenzhou, a coastal city in Zhejiang province that
is considered the cradle of the country's private economy. Ninety
percent of the people there are supported by private enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get rich, remember your origins,'' reads a billboard
there bearing the likenesses of Mao Tse-tung, Deng Xiaoping and
Jiang Zemin above the road to the airport. A similar slogan is
painted in white Chinese characters on a red banner stretched
across one of the bustling thoroughfares in town.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang toured Wenzhou's biggest private companies in May and
championed the role of business in helping China develop. But he
also called for greater Communist Party representation in private
companies.
</P>
<P>
   China's private sector got its start 20 years ago near Wenzhou,
in the lush green hills surrounding the glassy Ou River. A small
river town named Qiaotou became a trading entrepot between Shanghai
button makers and garment factories farther down the coast after
Deng allowed free markets to sprout around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, many Qiaotou families were making buttons themselves. They
pooled resources to build a button market, now housed in a new,
buttonlike circular building at the center of town.
</P>
<P>
   Jin Wenwu recalls growing up in a cramped three-story house
filled with buttons, which he sealed in plastic bags with heat from
a candle.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was a teen-ager, the family had begun punching
buttons from plastic sheets and drilling holes in the buttons using
crude, hand-operated machines.
</P>
<P>
   The business grew along with others in town until there were too
many button makers, forcing a wave of mergers that created China's
first companies with shareholders. Jin now owns a 25 percent stake
in one of the merged companies.
</P>
<P>
   Above the roar of buttons tumbling in a dozen rotating polishing
machines, Jin says the government offers no help, but has not
interfered with his business either _ yet. An official called the
other day asking for a list of party members who work in his
factory.
</P>
<P>
   Because relationships with officials are still so crucial, many
private business owners are really just opportunists exploiting
their party connections. The resulting corruption has not helped
improve the private sector's image. One of the most celebrated
entrepreneurs, Mou Qizhong, was recently sentenced to life in
prison for fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Other businesses disguise themselves as government-owned
entities to survive. Guo Hongnian and four friends pooled $72,000
in 1992 to establish a liquefied cooking gas factory in Shanghai.
But as a private company, they could not get the proper license to
sell their gas.
</P>
<P>
   They paid a city-owned cooking gas supplier $30,000 in return
for registering them as a collective enterprise, and their business
took off. Its assets are worth about $12 million today.
</P>
<P>
   Much of China's economic growth in the last 20 years has come
from such variants of private enterprise. But the fuzzy ownership
structure has limited their growth into bigger companies. Banks and
outside investors are reluctant to finance the collectives because
it is not clear to whom the enterprises belong.
</P>
<P>
   When Guo, 52, wanted to cash out of the cooking gas concern, for
example, the city ruled that the assets belong to the collective
and that he and his friends are, in effect, nothing more than
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll fight for these assets the rest of our lives,'' insisted
Guo, shuffling a sheaf of dogeared papers that he said proves his
case.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the problems, there is a growing sense in China that
the private sector is an idling dynamo about to shudder to life.
All that is needed is a mechanism to give private owners access to
capital.
</P>
<P>
   The government is already talking about expanding the two stock
exchanges to make it easier for fledgling companies, including
private ones, to raise money. And it is talking about letting
foreign-owned companies list shares for buying and selling by
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   That would encourage foreigners to pump money into young
companies because it would give investors an easy way to get their
money out later.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Internet companies are providing the most energetic
private business growth because of foreign venture capital pouring
into the country.
</P>
<P>
   Given the current harsh environment, those private companies
that do play by the rules and survive end up remarkably healthy,
with resilient streams of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Yu quit a state-owned machine tool factory to start repairing
trucks in 1977. The business grew along with traffic on the roads
and he never needed to borrow.
</P>
<P>
   Having beaten the system once, he is confident his new venture
will succeed even though he has never been up in a blimp. ``When we
build one, I'll be the first passenger,'' he said.

SOME PROTEST LIGHTNESS OF CHARGE IN HOCKEY DAD DEATH

<P>
   READING, Mass. _ They're still reeling from the knowledge that
an infamously brutal fight took place in their town. Now, nearly a
week after Michael Costin was beaten to death at a local hockey
rink _ and days after Thomas Junta was charged with manslaughter _
residents of this woodsy bedroom community have a new concern.
</P>
<P>
   Given the shockingly violent nature of Costin's death, many say
the charges against Junta seem too light.
</P>
<P>
   ``If serious consequences aren't faced by people who are
consumed by that kind of rage, I'm just concerned that we won't be
able to stem this kind of thing,'' said Selectman George Hines.
</P>
<P>
   Residents are voicing similar complaints to each other and in
telephone calls to Matthew Nestor, chairman of the Board of
Selectmen. A securities lawyer who spent five years as an assistant
district attorney, Nestor said he's received a stream of calls from
neighbors, friends and residents, asking why Junta, a Reading
resident who pleaded not guilty on Monday, wasn't charged with
second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people initially come up to me, it's with puzzlement and
confusion,'' Nestor said. ``I have to tell you, I'm sending them
away mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Nestor said he disagrees with District Attorney Martha Coakley's
office, and believes the charges against Junta should have been
upgraded from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have said that after a verbal argument about rough
play by youngsters during a practice session escalated into a
shoving match, Junta, 42, pinned Costin, 40, to the ground, held a
knee to his chest, and banged his head against the ground until
Costin lost consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors charged Junta with a misdemeanor _ assault and
battery _ just after the fight, allowing him to go free until
Monday's arraignment. The fact that Junta turned himself in to
authorities before his arraignment, Nestor said, likely contributed
to Junta's relatively low bail.
</P>
<P>
   While prosecutors asked for $250,000 bail, District Judge Thomas
Brennan set it $50,000 surety or $5,000 cash, which his family met.
</P>
<P>
   But Nestor said Junta could have been charged with assault with
a deadly weapon: the concrete floor of the Burbank Ice Arena. And
he said he believes that Junta's actions meet the criteria for
second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   A murder, by law, is defined as an unlawful killing accompanied
by malice. And prosecutors can prove malice by demonstrating one of
three things: intent to kill, intent to cause grievous bodily
injury, or intent to cause an action that a reasonable person would
know creates a substantial likelihood of death or grievous bodily
harm.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Nestor said, Junta should have known that
bashing the Lynnfield man's head into concrete could cause
``grievous bodily harm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very puzzled,'' Nestor said. ``Those facts _ it's not even
a close call.''
</P>
<P>
   Anson Kaye, a spokesman for Coakley, said he couldn't discuss
details of the case. He did say that the district attorney's office
and police gave ``all due regard'' to the circumstances of the
case, and that ``the facts support a charge for manslaughter.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Kaye, a manslaughter charge must show ``a death
resulting from a reckless and wanton act,'' such as ``assault and
battery that results in death, or excessive use of force in
self-defense.''
</P>
<P>
   A second degree murder charge, Kaye said, requires ``probable
cause for malice, which includes a specific intent to kill.''
</P>
<P>
   At his arraignment, Junta's attorney Thomas Orlandi, said Junta
acted in self-defense. He said he started the confrontation because
he wanted to protect the children on the ice, who were playing
roughly under Costin's supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Several residents said the same. ``Five-thousand-dollar bail is
a ridiculously low bail. I think bail should have been set much
higher and I think he should have been held.''
</P>
<P>
   But others said they would accept the court's decision, and
defer to legal professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all part of the judicial system. That's what it exists
for,'' said Peter True, 59, a resident here for 30 years. ``People
have opinions about it, but that's life. The court's there for a
reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone interviewed expressed concern for Junta's wife
and children, who are well-known in sporting circles in this
sports-hungry town. Junta's wife coaches local kids in swimming,
and his daughter is a star on the high school girls' hockey team.
</P>
<P>
   Hines said he believes local residents will treat the rest of
the Junta family with sympathy and kindness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are realistic about assessing where the blame
belongs,'' he said. ``I don't think they'd snub his family. But
they do think the blame belongs with him, and what he did goes
beyond acceptable behavior.''

   MADISON AVENUE MEDICINE
</P>
<P>
   Q: I believe everyone has the right to promote himself, but is
it right for doctors to advertise? Does it compromise their ethics,
or are they and the public protected by the ``truth in
advertising'' laws?
</P>
<P>
   _ R.S. Englewood, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A: The American Medical Association's Code of Medical Ethics
states: ``There are no restrictions on advertising by physicians
except those that can be specifically justified to protect the
public from deceptive practices.'' But while this policy encourages
innovations that may be great for business _ Budweiser frogs that
croak ``bi-op-sy,'' tireless robot bunnies that keep healing and
healing and healing _ it does not serve the interests of the
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Medical advertising risks a conflict of interest, making the
doctor a salesman anxious to persuade rather than a disinterested
party eager to inform. This is especially perilous because most
patients lack the sophistication to make complicated medical
decisions. That is, while I may be qualified to select a laundry
detergent and hence to evaluate a soap commercial, I'm not
qualified to select a surgeon. And a 30-second TV spot is unlikely
to help me make so consequential a decision. (``With a name like
Dr. Schattzbergg, he's got to be good.'')
</P>
<P>
   I am, of course, similarly bewildered by ads for cars, computers
or even running shoes. A doctor, however, has taken an oath to
serve his patients; I believe the oath at Nike involves only
selling a lot of sneakers, and in the not-too-distant past,
delivering a dump truck full of cash to Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   There are better ways to meet the admirable goal of helping
patients choose a physician. Doctors' medical technique could be
rated by a neutral party, much as the Barron's guides rate
colleges. Or patients' opinions of bedside manner could be
correlated into a kind of physician Zagat's. Neither puts the
doctor in an ethically awkward position.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising is always a dubious means of education, since it
involves the testimony of interested parties. And while patients
need information, that need will not be met by transforming the
doctor/patient relationship into the McDonald's burger/eater
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Q: At our local library, a guy who seems unbalanced has been
viewing Web sites on how to build bombs. I mentioned this to the
librarians, but they did nothing. In the aftermath of Columbine and
similar incidents, I wonder if I should go to the police.
</P>
<P>
   _ R.F., Hartford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   A: People read murder mysteries without then killing their
neighbors. People read Pat Riley's ludicrous inspirational twaddle
without then destroying the beauty and poetry of basketball. In
America, you may read whatever books you wish. And the Internet
operates on the same theory _ although if you read in the tub, you
risk a painful electrical shock.
</P>
<P>
   There are many excellent ways to thwart violent crime. Creating
a Library Police is not one of them. The Columbine shooters you
refer to were reported to the police at least six times, not for
reading about bombs, but for actually making bombs, as well as
engaging in other criminal activities. Your librarians were right
not to act; there can be no free exchange of ideas when government
officials collect reading lists.

   WASHINGTON _ In an aggressive bid to topple the Republicans'
fragile six-seat majority in the House of Representatives, House
Democrats have built and substantial financial advantage over the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had an
unprecedented $37.4 million in the bank at the end of last month _
$15.2 million more than the National Republican Congressional
Committee had, according to second-quarter fund-raising reports to
be filed this week at the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raising climate for Democratic candidates has never
been better, Democratic officials said. The Democrats' cash reserve
for House contests is 10 times the amount they had in the bank at a
similar point in 1998 and seven times as much as they had in
reserves in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The gap has nearly doubled since it first became apparent at the
end of the last reporting period in March.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Republicans have raised more money overall for
House contests, their edge over Democrats is far less pronounced
than in previous election cycles and the Democrats have husbanded
their resources. Republicans, on the other hand have spent $68
million of the $90 million raised for House races.
</P>
<P>
   According to Democratic Party officials, their unprecedented
financial success is due in part to lingering anger at the
impeachment of President Clinton and in part because the goal of
retaking control of the House is in sight. As an example of the
Democrats' newfound fund-raising prowess, a dozen nonincumbent
Democratic candidates for House seats in contested districts have
already raised $1 million or more for their races. At this point in
1998, not a single nonincumbent Democratic House candidate had
raised $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts from both parties say that 30 to 40 House races will be
competitive this fall and those races are expected to cost at least
$3 million each and even more in areas where television advertising
costs are high, party strategists said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties had raised record sums through June 30 for House
contests, although the Republicans, who have raised $90 million,
have spent much more of what they have raised than the Democrats,
who have raised $60 million. The fast pace of party fund raising
for House races means that there will be many contests in which the
amount of money spent will swell into seven figures, amounts seen
more often in Senate contests. And recent federal appeals court
ruling in Colorado has encouraged the political parties to consider
ignoring federal spending limits on individual candidates' races.
</P>
<P>
   The large unlimited contributions known as soft money made up
two-thirds of the $60 million raised by the Democratic Party and
about half of the $90 million raised by the Republican Party. Much
of the federally restricted ``hard'' money raised by Republicans
comes through direct mail, a form of political fund raising that is
extremely expensive. So the Republicans have spent substantial sums
raising still more money.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to close the widening cash gap with Democrats, the
House Republicans have started a $16 million program, named
Battleground 2000. The money for the fund is being donated by
Republican members of the House, from their own campaign funds, in
amounts ranging from $700,000 from a few House Republican leaders
to $10,000 from House freshmen. It will be spent to support
Republicans who face tightly contested challenges in carefully
selected districts nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will look at each individual district and see what
Republicans need most _ get out of the vote campaigns, media
campaign, phone banking,'' said Marit Babin, a spokeswoman for the
Republican congressional committee.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Republican push to narrow the gap, campaign finance
experts say they cannot remember the last time the Democrats held
such a dramatic cash-on-hand advantage over the Republicans, who
have routinely out-raised the Democrats by at least a 2-to-1 margin
for many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The congressional Democrats are in a far stronger financial
position than the Republicans going into the general election,''
said Fred Wertheimer, the president of Democracy 21, which
advocates overhauling campaign finance law. ``And to my knowledge,
that has never happened before.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader, and
Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy of Rhode Island, the Democratic campaign
committee has used a variety of methods to attract large donations
from individuals and corporate political action committees.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Democrats expect to raise $1 million at an Aug. 27
fund-raiser in Newport, R.I., featuring the singer Tony Bennett.
The event is being billed as a chance for big donors and corporate
lobbyists to rub elbows with senior House Democrats who will become
committee chairmen if the Democrats regain control of the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic committee is also getting a substantial assist
from Clinton, who has headlined 14 events for House candidates,
raising $8.3 million. Vice President Al Gore has appeared at three
major House fund-raising dinners in recent months, bringing in $3.8
million.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, chairman of the Democratic House committee, said that
money is flowing to House candidates in part because many donors do
not believe Democrats will gain seats in the Senate and are
uncertain about Gore's ability to defeat Gov. George W. Bush for
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're clearly benefiting from the perception that we
need to have a last line of defense,'' Kennedy said. ``We need to
have an insurance policy if this does not end up being a banner
year for Democrats'' elsewhere on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   He said that his job is to ensure that House candidates in tight
races have the resources to compete and declared that the goal was
within reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way things are shaping up now,'' Kennedy said, ``we're not
going to lose a single seat for lack of money.''
</P>
<P>
   A longtime Democratic fund-raiser also attributed the party's
success to an abiding hunger to retake the House. ``We've been out
six years and people are hungry,'' said the fund-raiser, who spoke
on condition of anonymity. ``They're anxious to get back in.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   David Plouffe, the executive director of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, said that donors of all kinds had
helped fatten the committee's accounts. Small contributions are
coming in at a record pace, he said, as well as large gifts from
unions, including a $1 million check from Local 1199 of the Service
Employees International Union, the largest single contribution the
committee had ever received.
</P>
<P>
   Plouffe said the committee was getting ``a lot more from the
Washington corporate community'' _ meaning lobbyists _ as well as
an increase in gifts from wealthy Democrats who in the past gave
chiefly to presidential and Senate candidates.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that Democratic House members have already
contributed $5 million to the committee from their own campaign
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Spending on House races by Republicans in particular could be
increased significantly by a new campaign finance loophole that was
created in May by a federal appeals court in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers Colorado
and five other Western states, struck down a 1976 federal election
law that limits how much money political parties are permitted to
spend directly on behalf of individual House and Senate candidates.
The cap was $67,000 per House district. Although the ruling covers
only six Western states, House Republican leaders and strategists
are considering a plan to funnel millions of dollars in highly
contested races nationwide. The decision will likely be appealed to
the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Since the appeals court decision, the Federal Election
Commission has issued an unusual statement that warns the political
parties that the $67,000 limits are still in effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``No decision has been made'' on whether to heed or ignore the
FEC's warning, said Babin, the House Republican committee
spokeswoman. ``Our lawyers are still looking at it.''

   MADISON AVENUE MEDICINE
</P>
<P>
   Q: I believe everyone has the right to promote himself, but is
it right for doctors to advertise? Does it compromise their ethics,
or are they and the public protected by the ``truth in
advertising'' laws?
</P>
<P>
   _ R.S. Englewood, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A: The American Medical Association's Code of Medical Ethics
states: ``There are no restrictions on advertising by physicians
except those that can be specifically justified to protect the
public from deceptive practices.'' But while this policy encourages
innovations that may be great for business _ Budweiser frogs that
croak ``bi-op-sy,'' tireless robot bunnies that keep healing and
healing and healing _ it does not serve the interests of the
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Medical advertising risks a conflict of interest, making the
doctor a salesman anxious to persuade rather than a disinterested
party eager to inform. This is especially perilous because most
patients lack the sophistication to make complicated medical
decisions. That is, while I may be qualified to select a laundry
detergent and hence to evaluate a soap commercial, I'm not
qualified to select a surgeon. And a 30-second TV spot is unlikely
to help me make so consequential a decision. (``With a name like
Dr. Schattzbergg, he's got to be good.'')
</P>
<P>
   I am, of course, similarly bewildered by ads for cars, computers
or even running shoes. A doctor, however, has taken an oath to
serve his patients; I believe the oath at Nike involves only
selling a lot of sneakers, and in the not-too-distant past,
delivering a dump truck full of cash to Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   There are better ways to meet the admirable goal of helping
patients choose a physician. Doctors' medical technique could be
rated by a neutral party, much as the Barron's guides rate
colleges. Or patients' opinions of bedside manner could be
correlated into a kind of physician Zagat's. Neither puts the
doctor in an ethically awkward position.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising is always a dubious means of education, since it
involves the testimony of interested parties. And while patients
need information, that need will not be met by transforming the
doctor/patient relationship into the McDonald's burger/eater
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Q: At our local library, a guy who seems unbalanced has been
viewing Web sites on how to build bombs. I mentioned this to the
librarians, but they did nothing. In the aftermath of Columbine and
similar incidents, I wonder if I should go to the police.
</P>
<P>
   _ R.F., Hartford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   A: People read murder mysteries without then killing their
neighbors. People read Pat Riley's ludicrous inspirational twaddle
without then destroying the beauty and poetry of basketball. In
America, you may read whatever books you wish. And the Internet
operates on the same theory _ although if you read in the tub, you
risk a painful electrical shock.
</P>
<P>
   There are many excellent ways to thwart violent crime. Creating
a Library Police is not one of them. The Columbine shooters you
refer to were reported to the police at least six times, not for
reading about bombs, but for actually making bombs, as well as
engaging in other criminal activities. Your librarians were right
not to act; there can be no free exchange of ideas when government
officials collect reading lists.

ISRAELIS DEMONSTRATE FOR AND AGAINST BARAK'S PEACE EFFORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MIDEAST-TALKS) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ As the Camp David summit meeting got under way
Tuesday, Vered Melki stood on a curbside near the residence of
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and held up a hand-lettered sign that
said, ``Go _ bring us peace.''
</P>
<P>
   She was one of about 1,500 demonstrators who turned out for a
rally in support of the embattled prime minister, whose governing
coalition and parliamentary majority crumbled this week, but who
insists he still has the popular backing of the Israelis who
elected him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the feeling that this is the moment of truth, and after
all the politics recently, I wanted Barak to see that there are
people behind him and that he's not alone,'' Melki said.
</P>
<P>
   The summit meeting is raising the political temperature on the
streets here. The rally Tuesday evening was one of a series of
demonstrations by both supporters and opponents of Barak and his
peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Near Barak's residence Tuesday evening, motorists could choose
from competing bumper stickers handed out by teen-agers. One said:
``The majority has decided: peace.'' Another warned: ``Barak is
losing the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Jewish settlers and their supporters on the
political right, alarmed by the prospect of a handover of land they
live on to the Palestinians, have dominated, holding protests and
posting signs that proclaim: ``Uprooting settlements tears apart
the nation,'' and ``You don't abandon your brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Their activities _ which included a prayer meeting Tuesday at
the Western Wall and the start of a hunger strike by founders of
the settlement movement _ are expected to climax in a mass
demonstration on Sunday night in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   Peace advocates, fearing that Barak might be exposed to the kind
of incendiary protests that preceded the assassination of Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995, have vowed to respond, starting
with the rally Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to have a presence on the street, to counter the
impression that the public is against the peace process, which is
simply not true,'' said Galia Golan of the Peace Now movement.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the turnout at the pro-Barak demonstration Tuesday night was
lower than expected by organizers. This was despite persistent
calls in the media in recent days by prominent liberal writers,
among them Amos Oz, for an outpouring of public support for the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Many people who back the peace effort were too complacent, said
Moshe Hay, who came to the rally from Kibbutz Dvir. ``They figure
that Barak will do the job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be a greater sense of urgency in the rightist
camp, especially among settlers afraid they may lose their homes.
</P>
<P>
   On the fringes of the peace rally Tuesday night, a group of
schoolchildren brought in from the West Bank settlement of Rimonim
held up signs and chanted slogans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want peace, but not at our expense,'' said 12-year-old
Dotan Cohen. ``Barak is selling us out.''
</P>
<P>
   A more ominous tone was struck by a handful of placard holders
from the banned extreme rightist party Kach, who sang, ``He's a
traitor,'' an epithet they had hurled at Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   At the pro-Barak rally, Rabin's daughter, Dalia Rabin, a member
of parliament, promised that this time such slogans would not go
unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The street will feel, the street will know, the street will
see who the real majority is,'' she said, ``and it is no longer
silent.''

 &HT;    Episcopal Church fails to endorse rite for same-sex union
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Episcopal Church stopped just short Tuesday of
moving toward creating a rite that could be used by same-sex
couples in commitment ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Deputies, half of the bicameral General Convention
of the 2.5-million-member denomination, overwhelmingly passed a
resolution recognizing that some people in the church live in
``lifelong committed relationships'' outside heterosexual marriage.
</P>
<P>
   But the body failed narrowly to ask for development of a liturgy
``by means of which the church may express'' support of committed
relationships outside the sacrament of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of both the lay delegations and clergy delegations in
the House of Deputies would have had to approve the request for it
to move into the House of Bishops for approval. It fell short by
fewer than five delegations in laity and one delegation in clergy.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Bishops is expected to take up the remainder of the
resolution today.
</P>
<P>
   The triennial General Convention was the third mainline
Protestant body to take up the issue this summer. Both the
quadrennial General Conference of the United Methodist Church and
the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) rejected
efforts to recognize same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing against development of rites that would support same-sex
relationships, several deputies warned of an exodus of people who
disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look around you,'' said the Rev. Kendall Harmon of South
Carolina. ``There are people sitting here today who will not be
here at the next convention . . . Let not this house tear asunder
what God has joined together.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Peter Cook of Western Louisiana said that to develop
rites recognizing same-sex relationships before the church takes a
theological position on the subject would be ``destructive to the
unity of our church.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can imagine no greater recipe for confusion and division,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. William A. Doubleday of New York called the proposal
for rites a ``grace-filled resolution'' and said it would make the
church ``open to new ways of ministering to God's people.''
</P>
<P>
   Also speaking for the rites, the Rev. Michael W. Hopkins of
Maryland, national president of the Episcopal gay rights group
Integrity, said, ``to set standards without liturgical support is
to refuse to extend the best of pastoral care this church has to
offer.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution as passed says the church expects relationships
to ``be characterized by fidelity, monogamy, mutual affection and
respect, careful, honest communication, and the holy love which
enables those in such relationships to see in each other the image
of God.''
</P>
<P>
   It never mentions homosexuality or same-sex relationships and,
in fact, leaves the door open for church support of heterosexual
relationships outside marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Herb Gunn, a lay deputy from Michigan, cited elderly couples who
might choose not to marry because of economic reasons but who want
their commitment to each other recognized by the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our diocese of Michigan, we've heard their appeals,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the other implications, both opponents and proponents of
same-sex unions saw the vote on establishing rights as a
significant step in setting church policy about homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It elevates the relationship between members of the same
gender ... to the same status as traditional heterosexual
marriage,'' said the Rev. David Anderson, a spokesman for the
American Anglican Council, a conservative caucus in the church.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said he was pleased that the resolution brought the
issue into the open. ``It's an up or down vote'' on approval of
same-sex unions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Susan Russell, a spokeswoman for Integrity, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not black and white,'' Russell said. ``It's a continuum
of a process ... It's not the whole enchilada, but there's enough
guacamole here that I can go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   By setting a high standard for all relationships, she said, the
church is making ``a huge step forward, not just for gay and
lesbian people but for the church's understanding of marriage.''
</P>

   NEW YORK _ The waves of immigrants who swept into Manhattan's
Lower East Side in the first years of the 1900s found almost
everything they needed sold right under their tenement windows.
Pushcart peddlers crowding the streets hawked fish and fruit, bread
and boots, pots and pickles. And with minimum start-up costs, new
entrepreneurs could scrape out a living provided they were willing
to bear the long hours and exposure to the elements.
</P>
<P>
   But the pushcart-packed streets made it hard for the Police and
Fire Departments to get through, drew the trash of trade and
aroused increasing ire from storekeepers resentful of the
competition. So in 1939, Mayor Fiorello La Guardia offered the
peddlers an alternative: The Essex Street Market, four cavernous
brick sheds that stretched from Broome to Stanton Streets. It soon
filled with vendors whose roof was no longer the sky.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the string of single-story structures was a vibrant
venue for fishmongers, butchers, greengrocers and purveyors of
low-priced garb. The mostly poor bargain hunters squeezed the
fruit, smiled or scowled over their fingers' findings and parted
with their pennies and dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But by the 1970s, as shoppers increasingly preferred
supermarkets and street-front stores to indoor stalls, the market
began shrinking. Today, only two dozen merchants remain in just one
of the four city-owned buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as old markets across the country have been revived in
recent years and new ones, like the three-year-old Chelsea Market
in Manhattan, have opened, the city has sought to sustain the
surviving slice of the Essex Street Market; even, most recently, to
introduce a stylish touch.
</P>
<P>
   It has refurbished the interior of the blocklong building
between Delancey and Rivington Streets, reconstructed some of the
stalls and improved the heating and cooling systems. And it has
leased one end of the hall for a restaurant that will be the
market's first upscale operation when it opens this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant's owner, Felice Banker, says she hopes to draw
the hip young residents who have been moving into the area, as well
as veteran Lower East Siders. The Essex Restaurant's recessed floor
lighting on newly built mezzanines will share a building with $5
skirts and $10 dresses hanging over stalls.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three other buildings that were part of the original
market, one, at Stanton Street, has already been transformed into a
satellite outpatient center run by NYU Downtown Hospital, which
signed a 10-year lease for the building in 1995, after it had stood
empty for many years.
</P>
<P>
   The two remaining market sites, one vacated more than a decade
ago while the other is nearly empty, are also the focus of
recycling efforts. But the attempt to revive one of them shows that
redevelopment in the city is rarely a cakewalk.
</P>
<P>
   One of these buildings, at Rivington Street, was leased to Henry
Rainge-Megill for 20 years. Rainge-Megill was given the lease by
the city two years ago to transform the building, then vacant, into
food kiosks, a banquet hall, a cocktail lounge and a bakery and
cafe. Now, however, the city is seeking to evict him, citing rent
arrears.
</P>
<P>
   Rainge-Megill said he had already put more than $1 million into
the building. He said he had overcome the financial problems that
led to the arrears (including unanticipated major structural
expenses and a partner who ran out of money) and could finance the
remaining $500,000 worth of work.
</P>
<P>
   But the city, he said, has refused to accept the late rent
payments and has moved to evict him.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Rainge-Megill, 63, is determined to keep his
lease. ``I'll go to the Supreme Court!'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Brodoff, a spokesman for the city's Economic Development
Corp., which administers the market sites, declined to respond
because the ``matter is in litigation.'' He would say only that the
rent arrears were the reason for the eviction and that if the
agency won Rainge-Megill's ouster, it would seek new proposals for
the site.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth building that was once part of the market stretches
the full block from Broome to Delancey Streets and stands vacant
except for a street-front liquor store and small diner. It has been
included in a group of five sites in the area for which the city
has invited developers to submit urban renewal proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of the remaining merchants in the Essex Street
Market favor having upscale fellow vendors, others fear that this
would cause their rents to soar. But Brodoff said, ``Any upscale
shops that might take space at the market will have no impact on
the rents paid by the other tenants.''
</P>
<P>
   He said annual rents for the market's stalls now range from $22
to $25 a square foot. Faith Hope Consolo, vice chairman of the
retail leasing firm of Garrick-Aug Associates, said that these
compared with a going rate of $60 a square foot for stores on the
broad thoroughfares of Essex and Delancey Streets, but were on par
with store rents on Rivington, a side street.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the cheaper rents, most of the Essex Street Market
vendors have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   In the market's early years, ``the shopkeepers were all Jewish
and Italian and the customers were mostly Jewish and Italian,''
recalled Allen Ruhalter, a butcher whose business, begun by his
father, is the market's only survivor from its opening day. Most of
the market's patrons today are Hispanic and Asian.
</P>
<P>
   Ruhalter, 68, who began working at the family's meat counter
while in junior high school in the mid-1940s, recalled that his
schoolboy start as a market meat merchant required a contribution
from the dairy stalls. ``I was so small, I had to stand on a milk
crate to look over the counter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruhalter's son, Jeffrey, 44, who also works in the operation,
put himself with those market merchants and other local business
people who favor an upscale turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like it upscale to attract the people moving into the
neighborhood,'' he said of the affluent young arrivals who in the
last few years have moved into expensive apartments in renovated
tenements.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Flamm, executive director of the Lower East Side Business
Improvement District, said that the market already offered ``fine
meats, produce and fish'' and that his group wanted to see ``more
quality food and food-related products,'' but only to fill
vacancies and not at the expense of the current merchants.
</P>
<P>
   But some of those merchants are still worried that an upgraded
market could lead to higher rents that would drive them out the
stalls.
</P>
<P>
   Low-priced shirts and jeans hang over the entrance to the
cramped nook of Juan Vargas and his wife, Carmen Salvador. ``If
they raise the rent, we have to raise the prices,'' Vargas said.
``The people who shop here are medium and low income and don't want
to pay too much, so there will be no business.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Rivera, who has sold dairy items in the market for 15
years, said that ``everyone's concerned'' about rent rises.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it goes up, I leave,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Brodoff, the spokesman for the Economic Development Corp.,
emphasized that the agency was trying to keep the current merchants
viable, even as it was ``continually working on improving the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a Tiffany's,'' he said. ``But it's not a street
cart.''

AUTHORITIES MOVE AGAINST LEADING ENERGY, MEDIA COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian authorities Tuesday struck against several
leading energy and media companies suspected of wrongdoing, just
days after President Vladimir Putin promised to end special
privileges for the country's business elite.
</P>
<P>
   Police and security officials seized documents from a major
media company and Russia's largest natural gas conglomerate, filed
charges of tax evasion against the country's largest oil firm and
threatened criminal charges against the owner of a huge mining
concern unless he pays a $140 million fine.
</P>
<P>
   The moves against entrenched business elites here were
unprecedented in post-Soviet Russia, and unthinkable until Putin's
rapid rise to power. The companies involved owned by four powerful
members of the club known here as the ``oligarchs,'' tycoons who
have built business empires through what are widely seen here as
shady dealings and close ties to the Kremlin of former President
Boris N. Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Police and prosecutors gave no indication they were acting on
Kremlin orders, or that the raids were part of an organized action
against the oligarchs. But some observers saw a connection between
prosecutors' sudden desire to peer into the financial dealings of
conglomerates that have been thriving for years and Putin's
state-of-the-nation speech on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   There, Putin repeated his call to end favorable treatment for
Russia's biggest enterprises. He also suggested that private media
outlets have been turned into ``mass misinformation outlets and
into a means of struggle against the state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that open season has been declared on the
oligarchs,'' commented Eric Kraus, an analyst at NIKoil investment
bank.
</P>
<P>
   Police and security officials seized bundles of documents
Tuesday from Media-Most company, Russia's largest privately owned
media empire, and its flagship NTV television station as officials
pursued their case against owner Vladimir Gusinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The raid there was the second in three months _ although this
time the police did not have masks and automatic weapons _ and it
followed Gusinsky's four-day detention last month when he was
charged with defrauding the government of $10 million. The
investigation of Gusinsky, whose media have criticized the Kremlin,
has brought widespread assertions from abroad and from liberals in
Russia that a press crackdown is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Another police raid targeted Media-Most's largest creditor and
shareholder, Gazprom, which owns a quarter of the world's natural
gas reserves. Some analysts believe the Kremlin has pressured
Gazprom to call in its loans, a move that would force Media-Most
out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Others suggest the moves are orchestrated by tycoons closely
linked to Putin's rise to the Kremlin, and known here as ``The
Family,'' to push out competitors. According to this line of
analysis, going after Gusinsky, one of the weaker oligarchs
financially, was the first shot of a campaign against bigger fish _
like Gazprom's head, Rem Vyakhirev.
</P>
<P>
   ``The golden dream of The Family is to take control over
Gazprom,'' said Andrei Ryabov, an analyst for the Carnegie Center
in Moscow. ``They send out these signals ... against Gusinsky as a
part of the pressure campaing against Gazprom.''
</P>
<P>
   Less likely, analysts say, is that the government is making good
on Putin's pledge to create an equal playing field for all
businesses. Analysts point to Putin's choice for chief prosecutor,
Vladimir Ustinov, whose history of Family ties suggest he will
continue the prosecutors' sad post-Soviet history of pursuing
inquiries on the basis of political expediency rather than
legality.
</P>
<P>
   One example may be the criminal case opened against the
leadership of Russia's largest oil company, Lukoil, for alleged tax
evasion. Earlier this year, said Kraus of NIKoil, which is partly
owned by Lukoil, the oil company won an award from Russia's chief
tax inspector for its honesty in paying taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Another case in point is the recent pressure put on the
businessman whose company has a controlling stake in Norilsk
Nickel, Vladimir Potanin. The Moscow prosecutor's office filed suit
last month saying that the company should be returned to the state,
but it was rejected. Excerpts of a letter to Potanin from First
Deputy Prosecutor Yury Biryukov, published Tuesday by a leading
newspaper, suggested the magnate pay $140 million to the state or
face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``This letter is a letter from a racketeer to a businessmen,''
said Boris Nemtsov, a senior legislator close to Potanin. Nemtsov
said he would suggest to Putin that the level playing field is not
happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly,'' he said, ``there are businessmen who are close to
the authorities, and businessmen who are far from them.''

 &HT;    Hawks' rookies, free agents get test as Atlanta Summer Shootout
opens
 &HT;    By Maiya Hayes
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - It's time for redemption.
</P>
<P>
   After their 0-3 performance last year, the Atlanta Hawks are
shooting for an undefeated record in this year's Atlanta Summer
Shootout. The three-day tournament at Life University in Marietta
will match the Hawks' rookies and free agents against counterparts
from the Milwaukee Bucks, Miami Heat and Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Hawks coach Lon Kruger said the shootout is just an extension of
practice. Kruger said he is not expecting his team to blow out
opponents or play flawlessly. His players have had just three days
of practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a case of trying to execute some things defensively,
execute some things offensively,'' Kruger said. ``Trying to
transfer some things from a practice situation to a game-like
situation. And that's all part of the development that takes place
individually and as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami's team will feature second-round picks guard Eddie House
of Arizona State and center Ernest Brown of Indian Hills Junior
College. The Bucks' roster includes 7-foot-1 center Joel Przybilla,
the ninth draft pick acquired from Houston. Also playing for the
Bucks will be second-round guards Michael Redd of Ohio State and
Jason Hart of Syracuse. Forward Primoz Brezec of Slovenia and guard
Jaquay Walls of Colorado will play for the Pacers .
</P>
<P>
   Hawks rookie forward Hanno Mottola said he is not nervous about
today's game against the Heat. He said he expects Miami to be in
the learning phase, just as his team is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their attitude is going to be the same as ours,'' Mottola
said. ``They're not going to have 12 veterans out there. It's going
to be the same kind of guys. I don't think anyone expects us to be
able to execute defensively and offensively with ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be some struggle because it's still early,''
he said. ``As long as we try hard and try to improve every day, I
think that's the biggest thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kruger has conducted motivational practices, in which players
and coaches have done a lot of supportive huddling and
hand-clapping. He said one of his main objectives has been to boost
players' self-confidence and energy levels for games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to compete hard (and) play with enthusiasm and
intensity,'' he said. ``Otherwise, there's no reason to think that
you're going to do better than the other team. So, that's just a
starting point for the team, and these guys are establishing
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard Jason Terry didn't need a lot of encouragement to get
hyped for today's game. Terry, a rookie in last year's tournament,
said it is time for the Hawks to start a winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be exciting,'' he said. ``I'm ready to get back
out there after a disappointing season last year. This is the time
to get something back.''

BUSH URGES MOVES TO PROMOTE ADOPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)   By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROYAL OAK, Mich. _ Gov. George W. Bush declared Tuesday that
``foster care ought to be a bridge to adoption'' and called for
measures to promote adoption, including grants to states and an
increase in the adoption tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, announced
the proposals as he returned to his ``compassionate conservative''
themes and planned several weeks of appearances devoted to social
welfare measures for low-income and struggling Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush illustrated the day's theme by visiting the Judson Center
here, which provides support services to families. He listened as a
panel of young people, parents and officials described their
experiences with foster care.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor briefly outlined his ideas to change foster
care from a permanent situation for many children to a way station
toward adoption or toward a child's return to his biological
family. He proposed $1 billion in grants over five years to be used
by states to try to keep children with their biological families if
those homes are considered safe.
</P>
<P>
   He also proposed increasing the adoption tax credit, which was
signed into law by President Clinton in 1996, to $7,500 from $5,000
at a cost of $1 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush called for spending $300 million more over the same
period to be used for vouchers to assist teen-agers, usually about
18 years old, who are leaving the foster care system. The vouchers,
of up to $5,000 per person, could be used for college tuition or
vocational training.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he would require states to conduct criminal
background checks on prospective foster-care parents and adoptive
parents. Federal law currently allows states to opt out of the
checks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush pointed to his own state as a leader in improving foster
care and the adoption system. The number of children who can be
permanently adopted rose to 2,123 in 1999 from 1,033 in 1996
because of procedures developed to keep children from languishing
in foster care, an aide to Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign immediately tried to undercut Bush's
credibility on children's issues by pointing to such findings as a
1999 report that ranked Texas next to last among the 50 states in
the number of children living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facts speak for themselves,'' said Kym Spell, a Gore aide.
``Bush's record in Texas is short on compassion and long on broken
promises.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the 45-minute panel session, Bush simply questioned
the panelists or listened as they told inspirational tales of
overcoming difficult family situations. Television cameras filmed
the kinds of scenes that have become a Bush campaign staple: the
candidate governor surrounded by minority children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate the spirit of love that exists inside these
walls,'' Bush said, as he sat under a blue banner proclaiming
``Strong Families, Safe Children.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Lt. Gov. Connie Binsfeld of Michigan told Bush that
states need more flexibility in using federal funds, as well as
more money to help foster parents who want to adopt children from
troubled homes but who cannot afford their medical and
psychological care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could talk for two days, governor,'' she said, ``because _
''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush interrupted her, saying, ``I don't know if I could
listen for two.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point Bush hugged one of the two foster sons that
Sierra Craig was adopting as he talked to her about the adoption
tax credit. He tried to draw out her 11-year-old son, Eric.
</P>
<P>
   ``What grade are you in?'' the governor asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixth,'' the boy whispered.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said: ``That's good. I was in sixth grade once, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor spent most of the day in this battleground state at
three receptions intended to raise nearly $2 million for the
national and state Republican parties.

 &HT;    Judge restricts law firm's solicitations in Coke suit
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A federal judge Tuesday placed restrictions on
attorney Willie Gary's law office and the clients he represents in
the Coca-Cola racial discrimination case.
</P>
<P>
   The order by U.S. District Judge Richard Story came after
another group of plaintiffs' attorneys in the lawsuit accused
Gary's firm of illegally soliciting fee agreements from Coke
workers affected by the class-action case.
</P>
<P>
   Story did not address whether Gary's firm violated any court
rule.
</P>
<P>
   Tricia C.K. Hoffler, an attorney in Gary's Florida law office,
said ``that is very important because we have maintained all along
that we have operated in a very ethical, appropriate and
professional manner and did not violate any rules, regulations,
court orders or laws.''
</P>
<P>
   But the other side disagreed about the meaning of the telephone
conference hearing held Tuesday before Story's order.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court did not rule on the issue of past conduct,
concentrating instead on future conduct,'' said attorney Cyrus
Mehri, whose team brought the allegations against Gary's firm. ``We
are pleased that the court drew a firm line in the sand, upheld the
rule of law and is imposing certain appropriate restrictions.''
</P>
<P>
   In an order agreed to by both groups of attorneys, the judge
prohibited Gary's firm and its Coke clients from:
</P>
<P>
   _Soliciting or entering into any fee agreements or providing
legal services about the case at this time to the 2,000 members of
the class.
</P>
<P>
   _Soliciting class members to not participate in the case.
</P>
<P>
   _Communicating with class members about the ``substance of this
lawsuit.'' But if communications are initiated by a class member,
Gary's firm can discuss certain individual issues, including ``the
possibility of representation.''
</P>
<P>
   _And communicating with any class member ``either directly or
indirectly through public statements or otherwise regarding the
settlement in principle which has been reached in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Terms of that settlement are not expected to be released until
late October, after they are finalized between Coca-Cola and the
group of plaintiffs' attorneys led by Mehri.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge's order will allow class members to have a full and
fair opportunity to make decisions based on the complete record in
due course,'' Mehri said.
</P>
<P>
   After the settlement terms are announced, class members can
accept them or ``opt out'' and pursue their own individual monetary
claims against Coke. At that time, they can also hire an attorney
of their choosing, including Gary's firm.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffler, of Gary's office, said the court is ``merely confirming
what we have been doing all along. It's business as usual for us.
From our standpoint, we feel vindicated by the judge's order, which
we consented to. It's welcome for the judge to set the
parameters.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffler said similar parameters already govern Mehri's legal
team.
</P>
<P>
   The court did not rule on the validity of existing agreements
between Gary's firm and some Coke workers. Instead, the judge
ordered Gary's firm to provide him with a confidential list of
class members who have already signed fee agreements with his firm.
</P>
<P>
   Gary represents at least eight plaintiffs who are suing Coke.

CALIFORNIA BEACHES FACE MOUNTING POLLUTION FROM STORM DRAINAGE

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For years, Southern California has been engaged in
an epic pollution battle, the struggle to get rid of the brown
smoggy haze that hangs over the skyline on a hot summer day.
</P>
<P>
   Now the region is caught in another struggle that will provide a
new test of its political will and the social conscience of its
residents: rethinking a system that dumps nearly a trillion gallons
of polluted urban runoff each year into the ocean alongside some of
Southern California's most fabled beaches.
</P>
<P>
   In the dry summer months, Southern California's beaches are
considered among the cleanest in the nation, with pollution
concentrated near strom drain outlets and in the protected coves
preferred by mothers and their children.
</P>
<P>
   But during winter rains, the region's entire coast suffers.
Beaches that attract some 50 million visitors annually become
off-limits as storm drainage races to the ocean bringing with it
the waste of everyday life, everything from cigarette butts to oil,
lawn fertilizer, human waste and animal feces.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome here is likely to be a test for the rest of the
nation. The pollution of coastal waters has reached a crucial stage
virtually everywhere, with beach closures last year reported from
Huntington Beach, Calif., to Key West, Fla., to Southern New
England.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the pollution caused by runoff in Southern
California is not a new problem. Indeed, it is a function of the
way the region developed its storm system, a network of concrete
waterways designed to avert flooding by directing runoff to the
ocean.
</P>
<P>
   But rampant development and increased water testing revealing
the extent of the problem and the related health risks are raising
the level of debate among environmental advocates, state and local
officials and even the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Experts predict that solving the problem will cost billions and
will rival the efforts to control smog.
</P>
<P>
   With pressure for a solution mounting, Congress is considering
legislation that would require water testing and the posting of
unsafe conditions at beaches nationwide. The Environmental
Protection Agency has already established minimum quality standards
for recreational waters and has developed a program, still in its
infancy, to give the public access to water-quality information. In
California, Gov. Gray Davis recently provided an additional $5
million for jobs to help enforce regulations regarding discharges
and polluted runoff, while public awareness campaigns are urging
residents to think twice before pouring something down their
gutters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need more than anything else is a real sea change of
people's understanding of the problem,'' said David Beckman, senior
attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council in Southern
California. ``It's about the environment and public health, and if
you don't care about those two things, it's about your wallet.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckman likens storm drains to ``bazookas pointed at the ocean''
bombarding swimmers and surfers with the bacteria and other
pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   In the region stretching from Ventura to the Mexican border, the
volume of runoff has grown to nearly a trillion gallons annually in
1995 from 65 billion gallons a year in 1972, according to the
Southern California Coastal Water Research Project, a consortium of
sanitation districts and regulators.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 study by the University of Southern California and the
Santa Monica Bay Restoration Project found that people who swam
near a storm drain were 50 to 150 percent more likely to report
symptoms like fever, diarrhea, nausea and upper respiratory
ailments.
</P>
<P>
   But as the problem worsens, environmental groups say government
agencies are not enforcing regulations. The resources defense
council, an nonprofit environmental group, has petitioned the EPA
to force the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board to
enforce regulations regarding discharges or be removed from its
role as overseer.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clean Water Act requires big cities, large industrial
entities and large construction sites to comply with storm water
regulations, but noncompliance is rampant,'' Beckman said.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis Strauss, the EPA's director of the water division for the
Western states and 140 American Indian tribes, said the governor's
approval of $5 million for the hiring of additional manpower for
the water quality boards would probably help resolve the defense
council's concerns in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Of the 150 employees on the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality
Control Board, 7 work in the storm water program, overseeing some
3,500 industrial operations, 96 cities and 2 counties plus
construction sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have taken every effort to deal with storm water pollution
commensurate with our capability,'' said Dennis Dickerson,
executive officer for the control board.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson noted that the board established measures to limit
litter discharge and has increased its efforts to enforce municipal
permits on runoff levels. In January, the board approved stricter
standards that would force builders to install abatement measures
in many commercial projects.
</P>
<P>
   But the new standards are being challenged by a number of cities
along with builders and oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Richard Montevideo, who is representing 32 of the 33 cities in
Los Angeles County that have challenged the regulations, said they
were poorly written, not well researched and might hold unknown
dangers for the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations require new development projects to filter or
treat the first three-quarters of an inch of runoff in a 24-hour
period. The standard is written to include projects like commercial
developments of more than 100,000 square feet, gasoline stations,
auto repair shops and developments of more than 10 houses. But,
Montevideo said, the wording would also seem to make the
regulations apply to some homeowners _ specifically those on
hillsides or those living in environmentally sensitive areas _ if
they make improvements.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the new regulations would hamper the development of
low-to-moderate income housing.
</P>
<P>
   Montevideo, who also represents building-industry groups, wants
the state water board to consider a less restrictive program.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, Santa Monica and West Hollywood have all endorsed
the new standards, and several innovative projects to address the
problem are in place, in the works or near completion. For example,
Los Angeles County has established diversions affecting five drains
where highly polluted runoff is a problem. During dry weather the
runoff is first channeled into sewage treatment plants.
</P>
<P>
   The county is also using nets and other barriers to collect
trash that flows into drains and has spent $5 million in the last
four years to educate residents about how they can help eliminate
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Monica projects include a $10 million recycling plant
that will treat the water and then pump it for use irrigating parks
and street medians.
</P>
<P>
   While such project provide alternatives in dry weather, the
solution for handling runoff in wet weather remains elusive.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of the debate, the Los Angeles region is a
ground zero for the runoff issue, which exists nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing the effects of runoff pollution at beaches all
across the country,'' said Kelli McGee, coastal programs counsel
with the American Oceans Campaign, which is dedicated to preserving
oceans and coastal habitat. Quantifying the problem, McGee said, is
difficult because only 10 states have monitoring programs.
</P>
<P>
   The House has passed a bill that would require states with
coastal waters used for recreation to establish minimum standards
for water quality, monitor them and post when levels exceed safe
levels. A similar bill is working its way through the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The federal legislation is modeled after a California bill
passed in 1997 that required testing of water for bacteria at
beaches with 50,000 visitors a year between April and October and
required warnings when bacteria reached a certain level.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles region is problematic because storm water
systems are separate from sewage systems. This is to prevent the
torrential rains, which typically occur during the winter, from
overwhelming sewage treatment systems
</P>
<P>
   In the Los Angeles area, with some 10 million residents living
in what amounts to a concrete bowl that slopes toward the ocean,
rainfall is directed into paved rivers and creeks that force the
water to the ocean. But along with that water comes every piece of
garbage and a variety of pollutants left behind on streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``That, in a nutshell, is the problem,'' Beckman said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The pollution problem is most prevalent in the winter when rains
are heaviest. That fact is best illustrated by the annual report
done by Heal the Bay, which for 10 years has issued a review of
water quality at the beaches. Of the 263 beaches reviewed this
year, 174 or 66 percent received an A, for excellent water quality
in dry weather. In wet weather, that figured dropped significantly,
with only 25 percent of the beaches receiving an A or a B for
excellent to good water quality during weather.
</P>
<P>
   Although the problem is worse during the winter months, it still
occurs during the summer. Much of Huntington Beach was closed to
swimming from July 1 through Labor Day last year because of high
bacteria counts. The cause is still unknown, but investigators have
zeroed in on runoff.
</P>
<P>
   And beaches geared for children, many of which are near storm
drains and in calmer waters, tend to be a problem year-round.
Mother's Beach in Marina del Rey, for example, is routinely
declared unfit for swimming.
</P>
<P>
   While strides are being made to divert or treat runoff during
the summer, solutions are nonexistent for the winter months.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Moore, a surfer for more than 40 years who operates a
boat for microbiological testing, is aware of what lurks in the
waters. But he does not always heed the warnings. Recently, Moore
got a painful lesion that he believes was the result of surfing in
contaminated waters at Seal Beach in Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   Moore and four companions all got sore throats. A boil developed
on Moore's forearm, which had to be treated with antibiotics. The
problem worsened until he had to be hospitalized for treatment of a
streptococcus infection, which he said doctors diagnosed as a form
of flesh- eating virus.
</P>
<P>
   While no one can be certain whether the infection was related to
surfing in polluted waters, Moore _ who has surfed in the area for
42 years _ believes it was and will not take chances again.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I have to do after this enormous trauma is stay very wary
and very concerned about discharges,'' he said. ``It hurts because
this is my home. This is my roots, my ocean, my bay, my river
mouth. Now that's been taken away.''

 &HT;    Mickey Mouse art case has court date
 &HT;    By Bill Douthat
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Seizing early sketches of Mickey Mouse
in a foreclosure could expose the ``cultural treasures'' to
irreparable damage, an attorney for a financially strapped cartoon
museum argued in court Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Moving the fragile pencil drawings would take about three to
four weeks of preparation, attorney Nancy Colman told Circuit Judge
Water Colbath.
</P>
<P>
   SunTrust Bank asked Colbath Tuesday to grant it possession of
the sketches because the International Museum of Cartoon Art in
Boca Raton is $170,000 in arrears on mortgage payments. The museum
owes $1.1 million on a $3 million loan it took out in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to both sides for about a hour, Colbath said he
would issue a ruling later.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's curator testified that the 36 drawings are worth
from $3.2 to $3.7 million because they are the earliest existing
drawings of the cartoon figure that became the icon of Walt
Disney's entertainment empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are historic artifacts and they should not be endangered
unnecessarily,'' said curator Stephen Charla. ``They are at the
safest place they could be.''
</P>
<P>
   The drawings are not exposed to direct light and are protected
by a black cloth at night, Charla said. Sunlight and temperature
changes could be damaging, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Laslo G. Schwartz, a conservator who has inspected the drawings,
said they are regarded as ``Mickey Mouse's birth records'' and
deserve careful handling. Even tilting the framed drawings the
wrong way could rip the paper, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's attorney, Lisa Hermann, said the bank would exercise
care in moving and storing the drawings.
</P>
<P>
   Hermann objected to the references to the drawings as cultural
treasures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm failing to understand if they are such cultural treasures,
why would they be pledged for this loan?'' Hermann said.
</P>
<P>
   Colman said the bank and another guarantor of the loan requested
the drawings be included as collateral.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, opened in Mizner Park by Beetle Bailey creator Mort
Walker, is working with another financial institution to refinance
its mortgage, Colman said.

ARMSTRONG, THE LEADER, DISPLAYS POWER IN THE PYRENEES 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL ABT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   REVEL, France _ ``The Tour is finished,'' Eddy Merckx decided
Tuesday. He found no dissenters. Who could disagree with a man who
won five Tours de France and 520 other races? Who, furthermore,
could disagree after watching Lance Armstrong break a lot of legs,
as the riders put it?
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a very strong ride, an exceptional ride,'' Merckx said,
referring to Armstrong's facile demonstration of power Monday in
the Pyrenees. ``It's over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not only the best rider but the most serious. He races
all season, not just one month, like so many others,'' a dig at
those, unlike the Merckx of old, who care exclusively about victory
in the Tour de France. ``Lance has won his second Tour. What he did
yesterday nobody has done for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, the Texan, and Merckx, the Belgian champion of the
1970s, long one of Armstrong's heroes, are close friends. That did
not appear to influence Merckx's judgment, which is universally
shared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anybody climb so swiftly,'' Raymond Poulidor,
who finished second in the Tour a handful of times in the days of
Jacques Anquetil and Merckx, said Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Only Armstrong is still reserved about the outcome. ``Form is a
funny thing _ it comes slowly and goes away quickly,'' he said
Monday. Tuesday he said that he had balked at having Champagne
served at the team dinner after the Pyrenees stage because he
finished second, not first.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win in Paris, there will be Champagne,'' he said, ``but
Paris is a long way off.'' The Tour ends there on July 23.
</P>
<P>
   Another former champion who raved about Armstrong's performance
was Greg LeMond, the other American who won the Tour and who is in
France for a reunion of his old Z team, with which he finished
first in the world's greatest bicycle race in 1989 and 1990. ``I
haven't seen anybody dominate a race like that, ever,'' said
LeMond, who also won the Tour in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   He watched the mountain stage on television. In it, the leader
of the U.S. Postal Service team built an overall lead of more than
four minutes over his rivals. Merckx watched it in person, offering
commentary for Belgian television then and his opinions Tuesday in
Revel as he awaited the finish of the 11th of 21 daily stages.
</P>
<P>
   With the rivals that Armstrong has buried in the standing
awaiting possible revenge on the next big climb on Thursday, two
low-ranked riders were given their freedom Tuesday. The two,
Santiago Botero, a Colombian with Kelme in 45th place, and Erik
Dekker, a Dutchman with Rabobank in 61st place, made the most of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Bolting away at Kilometer 14 of the 218.5-kilometer (135-mile)
jaunt, the two riders got as far as 14 minutes 44 seconds ahead.
</P>
<P>
   That was serious. Although Dekker started the day more than 26
minutes behind Armstrong, Botero was 17:40 behind. With the 14:44
lead, the Colombian was in second place over all on the road, the
realm of dreams. In addition, he is a good climber, unlike Dekker,
and could be a factor in the four days in the mountains ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Led by U.S. Postal Service, the pack began chasing and the lead
descended to manageable proportions. At the finish, Dekker was an
easy first in the sprint, completing the stage in 5:05:47, a speed
of 43 kilometers an hour (27 miles an hour).
</P>
<P>
   His victory in the second stage of the 87th Tour also increased
his lead in the race for the most aggressive rider. Botero
collected a bundle of points over six small climbs en route to
friendly Revel and rose from fifth to second place in the
competition for king of the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The vanguard of the pack finished 4:51 behind the two leaders,
with a larger group 14 seconds slower.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong held his overall lead of 4:14 over Jan Ullrich, a
German with Telekom and the 1997 Tour champion, in second place and
5:10 over Christophe Moreau, a Frenchman with Festina, in third
place. Botero jumped to 30th place over all and Dekker to 47th.
</P>
<P>
   The stage began in Bagneres de Bigorre in the foothills of the
Pyrenees and wended east through placid countryside, with long
vistas of sunflower fields and pastures spotted with horses and
cattle. The narrow, curvy road passed through avenues of plane
trees and tidy villages.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the tourist's France. But any tourist coming here
should pack earmuffs and an umbrella. The weather was cool _ 14
degrees Celsius (57 Fahrenheit) near noon _ windy and
intermittently rainy. Summer seems to have skipped France this
year.

   A military court acquitted a former Tehran police chief of
ordering an attack on a student dormitory that led to a week of
pro-reform protests. The verdict brought immediate criticism from
students. Farhad Nazari and 17 subordinates were charged with
injuring scores of students and killing one in the attack last
July. Two defendants were found guilty. ``Such rulings will lead to
social insecurity and people will lose their confidence in the

 &HT;    Two celebrate end of battle to stay out of mental hospitals
 &HT;    By Bill Osinski

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Finally, E.W. and L.C. are home.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing before a federal judge in Atlanta on Tuesday,
Elaine Wilson and Lois Curtis _ previously identified by their
initials in their struggle to stay out of state mental hospitals _
celebrated the end of their legal battle with smiles and carefully
thought-out responses.
</P>
<P>
   Their case has already had a significant impact on the way care
is provided to mentally disabled people nationwide, according to
mental health experts.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing their best blue dresses, Wilson and Curtis each
confidently strode to the courtroom podium to tell U.S. District
Court Senior Judge Marvin Shoob what their landmark victory means
to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I'm in the free world, I love my freedom,'' said
Wilson, 48, who had been institutionalized at least 36 times.
``When I was in the hospital, I felt like I was in a little box,
and I couldn't get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis, 32, said the settlement means she can now the right to
do little things she was never allowed to before, like go to her
room and listen to her radio.
</P>
<P>
   More than three years ago, Shoob ruled that arbitrarily denying
Wilson and Curtis a community-based life amounted to segregation of
persons covered by the Americans With Disabilities Act. Last year,
the U.S. Supreme Court upheld that ruling. On Tuesday, Shoob
accepted a joint final agreement between the two plaintiffs and the
defendant, the state of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement provides a guarantee that Wilson and Curtis will
be provided community-based housing and training programs for the
rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major civil rights decision,'' said Ira Burnim,
legal director of the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, in
Washington, D.C. The impact on mental health issues is comparable
to that of the Brown v. Board of Education decision in the area of
racial equality, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half the states have already initiated planning on how to
comply with the decision, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Jamieson, the Atlanta Legal Aid Society attorney who
represented the two women, credited Shoob with setting the legal
precedent that led to the ultimate victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clung to your ruling like a lifeboat,'' she told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Supreme Court ruling, federal officials have told
Medicaid directors in every state that they must review their
funding patterns to provide community-based care for mentally
disabled clients who can function in community settings, she said.
In Georgia, a commission is expected to issue its report on the
issue to Gov. Roy Barnes this month.
</P>
<P>
   Legalities aside, Wilson and Curtis are proving the high court
right with practically every step they take in the real world. Both
women have major difficulties to deal with, but both say they're
doing just fine.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has been in and out of state mental hospitals at least 36
times in her 48 years. Sometimes, she'd wind up on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Life on the inside wasn't a horror story; mostly, it was just
bleak, Wilson said. ``They'd always tell you to take your medicine
and go sit down,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She and her mother got attorneys for the Atlanta Legal Aid
Society to take her case. (Later, Curtis was added as a plaintiff).
While the case progressed, she has lived in community-based housing
and attended training programs on weekdays. For the past nine
months, she has lived in the northwest Atlanta home of Sabrina
Sutton, a nurse and home care provider.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton said Wilson is becoming like a member of the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elaine has come a long, long way,'' she said. ``She picks up
on all the things the kids say. I deal with her like I do my
10-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been a dramatic decline in the types of behavior that
used to result in Wilson's return to the mental hospital, Sutton
said. Now, if Wilson starts to throw a temper tantrum, she's
reminded that she won't be permitted to go shopping if her behavior
doesn't improve. Usually, it does.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson doesn't even want to go to outpatient psychiatric
clinics, because she says, ``That's where crazy people go,'' Sutton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to be treated like they're somebody,'' Sutton
said. ``Everybody deserves a chance to live independently.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis spent about half of her first 27 years in state mental
hospitals, and they don't teach manners there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lois used to be very combative and destructive,'' said Sandra
Shields, director of Foundation of Exceptional Achievers, the
training program that Curtis attends on weekdays. ``I've seen her
throw guys around.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis had picked up a two-pack-a-day cigarette habit at the
hospitals, and she got to the point where she would make some very
inappropriate trades for cigarettes, Shields said. And when she
first came to the center, she'd scour the grounds for cigarette
butts, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Curtis may still want a cigarette, but she stops and
says something like, ``I know it's not good for me,'' and she
passes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being withdrawn, she speaks up in classes. She's
working toward a general equivalency diploma. She has displayed
real talent in art, and her sketches of people she's met or seen in
magazines make for lively wall decor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how to cook. I know how to clean. I know how to pay my
rent,'' Curtis said.
</P>
<P>
   No longer is Curtis treated as a defective person who must be
cut off from the rest of society, Shields said. ``Here, she just
has a disability she has to work on, like everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnim said despite the victory in Wilson and Curtis' case,
there are many thousands of people still needlessly confined in
state mental hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The old thinking was that mental hospitals were ``safe havens''
for people who couldn't make it in the real world, he said. ``But
in fact, the dynamic is not good when you put a lot of people with
serious problems in the same place.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the hospital setting, he added, there's little chance to
learn real-world skills and little motivation to change bad
behaviors.
</P>
<P>
   In court Tuesday, Curtis told Shoob of the things she has
learned to do for herself. ``I take my medicine and bathe myself at
night, then I get up in the morning and make my own bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Responded the judge: ``You've done better than a lot of lawyers
who've appeared before me.''

 &HT;    Lockheed Martin plant greets leader
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARIETTA, Ga. _ It took Lee Rhyant awhile, but he's found his
way back to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Rhyant was born 50 years ago in the small South Georgia
community of Sasser. He left the state as a child and eventually
pursued a career in the auto and aerospace industries up north.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's returned as the new man in charge at Lockheed Martin's
aircraft plant in Marietta and the first African-American hired to
run it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a homecoming,'' Rhyant said Tuesday at a ceremony to
dedicate the first C-130J cargo plane being built at the plant for
the Italian air force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan to meet some relatives in Alabama and Georgia I've
never met,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Rhyant started work last week as vice president and site general
manager of the Marietta plant under a new management structure that
emerged from the consolidation of Bethesda, Md.-based Lockheed
Martin's aircraft operations earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The shakeup put the Marietta plant under the control of a newly
created Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Co., based in Fort Worth,
Texas. It is headed by Dain Hancock, a Lockheed Martin veteran in
Fort Worth. Rhyant's predecessor in Marietta, Tom Burbage, is
executive vice president of the new unit.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Graham, who had been Burbage's No. 2 in Marietta, has
announced his retirement, and his chief operating officer position
won't be filled.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves day-to-day responsibility for Marietta operations
squarely in Rhyant's lap.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin announced Rhyant's hiring in mid-May, two days
after a group of African-American employees filed a racial
discrimination suit claiming mistreatment at the Marietta plant.
</P>
<P>
   The timing called extra attention to Rhyant's race.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview at Tuesday's C-130J ceremony he said there
was no connection as far as he's concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can honestly say the process of my coming here is more than
a year old,'' he said. He said his presence will influence work
force issues ``only if I do a good job'' and declined specific
comment on the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Many other issues confront Rhyant. Employment at the plant has
dwindled to about 7,000 following a work-force reduction of more
than 20 percent initiated last year. It may drift lower in coming
months as Lockheed Martin finishes consolidating management layers
in the new aircraft unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``My challenge is to continue to make this plant very cost
competitive and make the transition to (a consolidated) company,''
Rhyant said. ``And we need to do it while upholding the dignity and
respect for all workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhyant, the plant's fifth chief in six years, said he expects to
make some operational changes but added it's too early to be more
specific.
</P>
<P>
   He said he believes the worst is over for the Marietta plant.
The plant's viability has been in question because of early
troubles in the 5-year-old C-130J program, along with doubts about
whether the plant's other primary product, the F-22 fighter, would
be built in Marietta or built at all.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, C-130J sales have gained some momentum and the F-22's
future appears more stable. Lockheed Martin announced last spring
it had decided against moving final F-22 assembly from Marietta to
Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel as though (the Marietta plant is) on an upward trend
now, or I wouldn't have come,'' Rhyant said. ``I made a very
conscious decision to make the change that I did.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Sasser, Rhyant lived in Florida and graduated from
Bethune-Cookman College. He moved to the Midwest to join Allison
Gas Turbine, a division of General Motors, in 1972 and held a
succession of plant management positions. He remained with the
company in Indianapolis after its acquisition by jet engine maker
Rolls-Royce.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently he was vice president of production operations for
Rolls-Royce.
</P>
<P>
   Rhyant and his wife, Evelyn, will live in east Cobb and have
grown twin sons.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock and Burbage also attended Tuesday's C-130J ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock agreed the Marietta plant's future has brightened. ``As
long as the C-130J and F-22 remain sound programs, we have a
healthy future,'' he said. Burbage said one of Rhyant's challenges
is to convince employees of that and end a brain drain among
engineers and technicians that's occurred as a byproduct of the
uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Burbage also said he hopes Rhyant's tenure will be longer than
that of the past few plant chiefs, including himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we're past the point where we're trying something
different every year,'' he said.

<P>
   AIN EL HILWE CAMP, Lebanon _ Ahmed Hajar carefully unfolded the
tattered deed, written in Arabic script, dated 1946, and affixed
with a double row of green and purple tax stamps from the British
Palestine mandate that described the farm his family owned in what
is now Israel.
</P>
<P>
   He showed the government of Palestine identity card, No. 3665,
that had belonged to his father, Mahmout. His elderly uncle,
Muhammad, sitting beside him on a couch in the two rooms where
seven people live in this fetid refugee camp, still carries his
identity card from the mandate, faded and worn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, we had workers on our land,'' the uncle remembered about
the farm where they grew oranges, bananas and vegetables near the
sea in a village then called Smeirya. ``Now we must work in other
people's lands. It is difficult when you have once been an owner.''
</P>
<P>
   They are among more than 3 million Palestinian refugees _ _
80,000 of them crammed into three-quarters of a square mile of
misery in this camp near Sidon _ whose future is one of the issues
facing the Camp David summit meeting opening Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 200,000 Palestinian refugees are still in Lebanon.
Times are hard for them here, but they sense that they are not on
the top of the negotiators' agenda. They are bitter and fearful as
they wait for news, worried that they will be left out of any
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must tell you, Arafat only represents himself,'' said
Mahmoud Haleilel, a 19-year old student. ``He does not represent
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-years ago, the refugees here were a swaggering, heavily
armed ``state within a state.'' But their presence annoyed many
Lebanese, particularly Christians, who feared they would be _ as
the phrase went _ ``implanted'' here, and they became an issue in
the bloody 15-year civil war.Now, the refugees are largely confined
to their camps and forbidden any but the most menial jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The 1982 Israeli invasion ended the Palestinian military
presence in mostly-Muslim West Beirut and in southern Lebanon.
Syria soon ousted Arafat's remaining forces around the northern
city of Tripoli. Battles between rival factions further weakened
the Palestinians. And from May, 1985, to April, 1987, the Shiite
Muslim Amal militia, acting at the behest of Syria, laid siege to
the Palestinian areas in the ``Camps War,'' in which more than
1,600 people died.
</P>
<P>
   The camps today are surrounded by Lebanese troops, staffing
sandbagged checkpoints in helmets and flak jackets despite the
sweltering heat. Though Palestinians traditionally have had a high
level of education, regulations issued in 1990 barred them from
more than 60 professions, including medicine, law and engineering.
</P>
<P>
   The camp itself is a warren of cinderblock houses, built
literally on top of each other, because there is no other room but
up. Tiny, dark passageways lead to crowded rooms. Children are
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The streets are so narrow that when two cars try to pass,
monumental traffic jams result, resolved only by much patient
backing and maneuvering. Walls are decorated with faded paintings
of the Palestinian flag, revolutionary slogans and old heroes like
Che Guevera. Clusters of young men stand about with nothing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like we are in a jail here,'' said Assef Moussa, 28,
launching into a hand-waving string of grievances, in which the
word  &UR; mamnoua &LR;  _ Arabic for forbidden _ figured repeatedly. Lately,
it seemed, the government had stopped construction materials from
coming into the camps in order to prevent any further building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a physician, but I don't have the right to work here,''
said Dr. Ahmad Ghassem Halabi, who is allowed to practice only at a
clinic inside the camp. ``Here we face a very difficult situation,
a miserable situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the families here fled from parts of northern Israel in
1948 and are now into their third generation as refugees. Many left
in the widespread panic over news of the massacre in the Arab
village of Dier Yassin.
</P>
<P>
   Some families still have the keys to their old houses, carried
with them because they believed the promises of Arab armies that
they would be back home in a week. The old people keep alive the
memories of more than half century ago. The young make grandiose
demands that they return to the old villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father gave me this before he died,'' said Ahmed Hajar, a
gray-haired man who was born here, smoothing out the torn folds in
the old deed. ``He told me also, the Jews pushed out the
Palestinians. Really, he said, they stole your land. Remember this.
Don't forget this. This is your country. Your country is very, very
beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What my father taught me, I teach my son,'' he added, putting
his arm around his big-eyed 13-year old son Mahmoud, adding that
he, like many Palestinians here, took his children on Sunday into
the area of south Lebanon Israel had occupied until May so he could
look across the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is your country,'' he asked gently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Palestine,'' the boy replied.

CONVERGENT BUYS FLORIDA TELECOM SOFTWARE FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Fla.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Convergent Networks of Lowell, Mass., which makes advanced voice
and data telecommunications devices, said Tuesday it has spent more
than $100 million to buy a Florida telecom software company and
boost its product offerings and prospects for an autumn initial
public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Convergent is issuing stock with value ``significantly north of
$100 million'' to acquire Technology Control Services Inc. of Fort
Lauderdale, said Convergent chief executive John C. Thibault.
</P>
<P>
   TCS makes so-called softswitch products, which allow telephone
companies to add services such as call forwarding and calling cards
to their networks. Convergent sells combined voice-data switches
that use a fraction of the space of older telecom gear.
</P>
<P>
   The Convergent-TCS move mirrors recent efforts by Siemens AG to
create Unisphere Solutions of Chelmsford, Mass. from three area
telecom start-ups and a Siemens unit and the May acquisition of
Cornice Communications of Andover by Ennovate Networks Inc. in
Boxborough.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, companies aiming to go public have concluded they
can boost their value more quickly by acquiring other private
companies and building a bigger range of product offerings. Given
the recent choppiness in the technology IPO market, some analysts
think pre-IPO mergers make more sense for a start-up than going
public and then using their stock to buy companies to fill in
market gaps.
</P>
<P>
   Thibault said combining 100-person TCS with 140-person
Convergent ``on a pre-IPO basis gives us a company with much more
value than the two parts on a standalone basis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this positions us uniquely in the marketplace'' by
being able to offer by fall a ``next generation broadband switch''
that includes calling services that now would require partnerships
with at least two other vendors, Thibault said. It will also speed
Convergent's move into global markets by a year or more.
</P>
<P>
   TCS customers include British Telecom, which uses its switching
platform for a unified messaging service combining e-mail, voice
mail, and faxes. Convergent has announced sales of over $50
million, including pacts with Global NAPS of Quincy, WanTel of
Oregon and Duro Communications of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley networking giant Cisco Systems Inc. owns a
minority interest in TCS and will carry that stake over to
Convergent.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he would be interested in a sale of the company to
acquisition-hungry Cisco as an alternative to going public,
however, Thibault said, ``We are exclusively focused on building
the company as an independent entity and we look forward to
completing an initial public offering later on this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we have an opportunity like a Sonus Networks or a
Sycamore or an Akamai,'' three of the hottest recent local telecom
startups to go public, ``to build a company of substantial value to
our shareholders and customers and employees,'' Thibault said.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ Israeli and Palestinian leaders began their
fateful peace summit at Camp David on Tuesday with the far-reaching
goal of ending their 52-year-old conflict.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of an open-ended, tightly secluded meeting,
President Clinton ushered the leaders into the presidential retreat
where he hopes that the chemistry of the place and the moment can
induce a spirit of ``principled compromise'' that yields a
substantive peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the only one of the three leaders who spoke publicly on
Tuesday, talked in idealistic terms about securing a ``just and
enduring end'' to the conflict and about the ``gift of peace'' that
the leaders could give their children. But officials on all sides
acknowledge that a good, partial agreement would represent a
significant accomplishment and may be the only realistic end to
this fluidly scheduled, seat-of-the-pants-style summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, there is no guarantee of success,'' Clinton said at
the White House before flying to Camp David. ``But not to try is to
guarantee failure.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to erase a point of friction with the Americans,
Israel appears ready to announce soon that it will abandon or
postpone its $250 million deal to sell the Phalcon aircraft
advanced radar system to the Chinese. Israeli government spokesmen
said on Tuesday night that the Israeli-American dispute over the
plane, which has soured relations between Israel and many of its
backers in the administration and on Capitol Hill, will be resolved
by the end of the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving for their opening three-way meeting on Tuesday
afternoon, Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat did a smiley little dance at the entrance to
the Laurel Cabin at Camp David. It was a stubborn jig as each
sidestepped to try to make the other enter first into the crucible
of decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, with Barak's hand on his elbow, Arafat crossed the
threshold one beat ahead of the Israeli prime minister, who
constantly says that, ``It takes two to tango,'' for peacemaking to
work.
</P>
<P>
   The light-hearted but highly principled moment offered a glimpse
at the steely determination with which each Middle Eastern leader
is approaching the negotiating table, a rectangular one,
apparently, at which 21 American, Israeli and Palestinian delegates
sat on Tuesday to open their talks. But it was the only glimpse
offered into what the Americans, imposing a news blackout, are
trying to make an airtight environment safe from the pressures of
public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere is good, and the mood is serious,'' Joe
Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said. And that is about all he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Under leafy boughs, and in cabins named for trees, the Israelis
and the Palestinians were transported far from the cramped, dusty
and conflicted Middle East into the expansive, verdant hills of
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Barak was far away from the political crisis that crippled his
government on Monday, and Arafat was nowhere near the demonstrators
who marched on Tuesday in the West Bank to demand that he not sell
them out.
</P>
<P>
   Barak was placed in the Dogwood Cabin, which President Anwar
Sadat of Egypt stayed in 22 years ago when the successful
Israeli-Egyptian peace summit opened to complete public skepticism
about what it could accomplish. Arafat was given the Birch Cabin
that Prime Minister Menahem Begin of Israel occupied then.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, in what seemed a vivid illustration of why the
Americans are imposing the news blackout, senior negotiators for
the two sides have expressed contrasting views of the possibilities
of achievement. Shlomo Ben Ami, the Israeli internal security
minister, said on Monday that he felt confident that an agreement
could be reached. Abu Ala, speaker of the Palestinian legislature,
said that he did not comprehend how Ben Ami could speak with such
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinian position will never change,'' Abu Ala said in
an interview with the Voice of Palestine. ``And the Israeli
positions have its well-known `no's.' So how can the minister talk
about an agreement?''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli television reported on Tuesday night that the Americans
want all the thorny issues _ borders, Jewish settlements in the
West Bank, Palestinian statehood, water, the fate of the
Palestinian refugees and the future status of Jerusalem _ to be
discussed in parallel at the talks. This would put Jerusalem, a
seemingly irresolvable point of contention, on the formal
negotiating table for the first time in the seven years since the
Israelis and the Palestinians have been talking.

MARKET PLACE: SPINOFF OF JANUS MAY BE HELD DOWN BY COMPANIES IT
KEEPS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DANNY HAKIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is Janus Capital worth?
</P>
<P>
   Janus, the nation's hottest seller of mutual funds, will be
officially spun off Wednesday from its parent, the railway operator
Kansas City Southern Industries.
</P>
<P>
   For over a year, Janus executives and some of its top fund
managers have openly denounced the transaction because the fund
company is being packaged with Kansas City Southern's three other,
far smaller financial holdings under the name Stilwell Financial
Inc. The executives argue that their company would be assessed a
greater value in the market if it traded on its own.
</P>
<P>
   A recent spate of acquisitions, spurred in part by a growing
appetite for globalization, has indeed put lofty prices on some
asset managers, far more than that put on the Stilwell offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think investors will continue to push management to unlock
the value of Janus,'' said Henry McVey, an analyst at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   In the most heated of the recent deals, Thomas F. Marsico, once
the star manager of the firm's Janus Twenty fund, agreed to sell
the remaining half of his three-year-old company, Marsico Capital
Management, to Bank of America. The transaction values Marsico at
$1.1 billion. Given that the fund complex manages about $15
billion, most analysts consider it a generous price at 7.3 percent
of assets.
</P>
<P>
   Using that pricing benchmark, Janus, which manages $309 billion,
could be worth more than $20 billion. By comparison, Stilwell,
which includes Kansas City Southern's stakes in the asset managers
Berger Associates and Nelsons Money Managers as well as the
financial services data processing firm DST Systems _ had a market
capitalization of $9.8 billion as of Tuesday's close. (The stock
has been trading on a so-called when-issued basis, which allows for
transactions in anticipation of a security's issuance.)
</P>
<P>
   Acquisitions, of course, often bring premiums to public
companies, in anticipation of synergies. And some other recent
deals have been for less lofty prices than Marsico's. At the low
end, United Asset Management has agreed to be acquired by the South
African money manager Old Mutual for less than 1 percent of its
assets. More typical pricing has been 2 to 4 percent of assets,
though stock analysts say cash flow may be a more useful measure
than assets under management.
</P>
<P>
   Still, should Janus not merit a top-tier valuation? After all,
the company, noted for its big bets on technology stocks, has
arguably been the mutual fund firm to profit most from the bull
market. Its assets have more than quadrupled since the end of 1997,
when it ran just $67.3 billion, and its funds continue to outsell
those of Fidelity Investments and the Vanguard Group.
</P>
<P>
   Most stock analysts who have followed Janus say the company is
being held back by its packaging with Stilwell. Salomon Smith
Barney even has a 20 percent ``holding company discount'' on
Stilwell as a hedge against the possible departure of any of Janus'
star portfolio managers. Salomon estimates that Stilwell is trading
at 15 times its earnings, while the average for asset managers is
18. Janus, it argues, merits closer to 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``Janus is worth, at a minimum, double what it's currently
valued at.'' said Steven Eisman, an analyst at CIBC World Markets.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce R. Brewington of Putnam, Lovell Securities said Stilwell's
preliminary trading puts it in the low end of asset managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd argue that they're a premier franchise, so they'd go in
excess of the median,'' Brewington said. ``Janus would be better
served as a stand-alone entity. The company could be worth $20
billion.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, asset managers are enjoying a surge in popularity
after a year of doldrums. The Putnam, Lovell Index of Publicly
Traded Money Managers, which tracks 17 asset management firms,
gained 30 percent the first half of the year, compared with a 1
percent drop in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index. Last year,
the index gained 16 percent, four percentage points behind the S&AMP;P
500.
</P>
<P>
   And Stilwell's stock is likely to get at least some small boost
as it is added to the S&AMP;P 500 at the end of trading Wednesday, and
asset managers that mimic the index add the stock to their
portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Mark L. Constant, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, sees less room
for improvement than the other stock analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would things be better if they spun off separately'' from
Berger and the other units? Constant asked. ``Yes, they would be
better valued, but not astronomically.''
</P>
<P>
   Constant noted that separating Janus, at this point, could
create billions of dollars in tax consequences. And one of Kansas
City Southern's main arguments for the Stilwell deal is that it is
structured as a tax-free spinoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be awarded the tax-free status, it must be a clear
separation of businesses that operate in different industries,''
said Michael Herley, a spokesman for Kansas City Southern. That
made it necessary to group all of Kansas City Southern's financial
holdings together.
</P>
<P>
   Putting Janus alone, Herley added, ``would have jeopardized the
tax-free status.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, Kansas City Southern management says that Janus' full
value will be appreciated. ``We do not believe the holding company
structure will trade at a discount,'' Herley said.
</P>
<P>
   Janus officials have disagreed with both points, but the crux of
the dispute comes down to control. In effect, it is a spinoff in
reverse, with the railroad being cast off. Landon Rowland, chairman
and chief executive of Kansas City Southern, is vacating that job
to become chairman and chief executive of Stilwell.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland will continue to walk a delicate balance with Janus'
founder, Thomas Bailey, who sold the majority of his company in
1984. Stilwell will be even more heavily dependent on Janus than
was Kansas City Southern.
</P>
<P>
   Janus accounted for more than 90 percent of Kansas City
Southern's revenue and operating income. Eisman suggests that
Stilwell shareholders, who will get two Stilwell shares for each
share of the railroad, could stage a proxy fight to wrest control
of Stilwell. But that would be difficult to win. A more likely
possibility is that Stilwell, or Janus, could be a takeover
candidate. Or some of Janus' star managers could walk away and
start their own firms, as Marsico once did.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, though, it appears that little will change at
Janus. Kansas City Southern, under Rowland, has left Bailey to run
Janus.
</P>
<P>
   A thaw between the two managements may even be in the offing.
Janus is now seriously considering Kansas City Southern's
invitation to recommend candidates to fill some of Stilwell's board
seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we're stuck with Stilwell,'' said Stephen Stieneker,
a Janus vice president, ``we have to try and make the best of it.''

 &HT;    Clinton to attend Palm Beach fund-raiser
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ President Clinton will be dropping by
the Colony Hotel and the home of Palm Beach County's Washington
lobbyist during a campaign trip here on July 31.
</P>
<P>
   Plans are still sketchy but Clinton is expected to arrive at the
Colony Hotel in Palm Beach in the early evening to attend a
$1,000-per-person money rasing event for U.S. Senate candidate Bill
Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   After that event, he will travel down the road to the Palm Beach
home of Eric and Colleen Hanson for another event raising money for
the Florida Democratic Party and the Democratic Senate Campaign
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Hanson is chairman of U.S. Strategies, a national lobbying
firm. He is also a major contributor to both Republican and
Democratic candidates. Two Democratic U.S. Senators, Tom Harkin of
Iowa and Tom Daschle of South Dakota, were groomsmen at his
wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Hanson was hired to be the county's Washington lobbyist last
year after some controversy over the failure of the commission to
seek bids for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, Florida's insurance commissioner, is being challenged by
Republican U.S. Rep. Bill McCollum of Altamonte Springs for the
Senate seat being vacated by Republican Connie Mack, who is
retiring. With just six seats needed to win control to the Senate,
both parties are focusing on this race.

TOURING THE CAMPUS, KICKING THE TIRES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Lessons Column) 
 By HUBERT B. HERRING    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A friend told me recently that he'd just bought a car without
driving it first. I was appalled. ``How could you buy it without
getting the feel of it?'' I asked. ``But it's loaded!'' he
responded. ``The leather, the CD player, all the goodies.''
</P>
<P>
   I was still appalled. And I quickly saw a parallel in the
college search now rattling about our household. With our son
careering toward his senior year in high school, my wife and I pore
over college guides. We are looking, at least in part, for a
college that is both ``loaded'' _ as measured not by CD's but by
average SAT's, faculty ratios, academics, whatever excellence can
be quantified _ and at the same time a realistic choice.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial thing, though, is finding a college that will feel
right to our son. His choice of a college, with whatever guidance
we manage to sneak in along the way, is a dauntingly big decision.
It will be the first place he lives on his own, might well provide
him with lasting friends, and will do much to shape his future,
professionally and otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   But while it's easy to get a feel for a car (if you drive it,
that is), it's awfully hard to really test-drive a college. The
manner of the tour guide on the day you visit, the weather, your
mood, some oddity in the cafeteria, a chance comment from someone
who knows someone who goes there _ any or all could loom out of
proportion. Many colleges set up weekends for accepted students,
but even those depend largely on the few students you link up with.
</P>
<P>
   Another friend told me recently that her son, who is midway
through college, had really chosen the wrong school. He had visited
this college first and loved it. But, she later realized, it was
the college experience he'd gotten a delicious taste of _ the
glorious independence. It hadn't fully sunk in, apparently, that
independence would come at any college, and that colleges differ
greatly.
</P>
<P>
   That tale reinforced my instinct to see as many colleges as our
schedules, and patience, would allow over the winter and spring.
Our son made it to about 10 schools, ranging from giant Boston
University to tiny Muhlenberg, along with mid-size schools like
Villanova, which, as of now, is the size that feels right to him.
But it can become a blur. When we did the whole drill _ including
information session _ at two schools in a single day, we all
suffered severe tour overload.
</P>
<P>
   I marveled at all the computer hookups, the wired dorms, the
smart cards that get you everything from dorm access to potato
chips (Hey, I thought, it looks like fun going to college now.),
and scanned the parade of students to see if they leaned more to
Abercrombie or pierced eyebrows. I also tried to get a sense of how
much temptation there would be to party your education away. (My
conclusion: The temptation is everywhere, in spite of the sober,
rehearsed answers given by tour guides.)
</P>
<P>
   My wife and I, as we hover nervously over this process, bring
far different perspectives to bear. While she's trying to recreate
the positive college experience she had, I think in terms of
helping him avoid my bad experience.
</P>
<P>
   After a wrong turn in freshman year, she found her niche and
lapped up college and graduate school gleefully. I, however,
squeaked into a ``loaded'' college via the waiting list, panicked
at the sudden competition, skipped numerous classes, and flunked
out in my junior year. I took so long to try again elsewhere that,
in an educational Mobius strip, a college classmate had become an
admissions dean at the school where I finally finished.
</P>
<P>
   And I often catch myself considering colleges in terms of what I
would prefer. I like cities, for instance, and often wish I could
get to know Boston better, so I was immediately intrigued by Boston
University. But no, it's my son's turn.
</P>
<P>
   I've heard people say that you should go to a good school not so
much for the professors but for the caliber of students you'll rub
shoulders with _ and, of course, ``network'' with later in your
awesomely dynamic careers.
</P>
<P>
   Well, OK. But unless I missed something, college is still mainly
about learning _ learning guided by professors. No statistics about
a school's supposed excellence can provide a clue about which
professors will strike a spark in which students. The one professor
branded in my memory was not at the high-octane college I first
attended, but at the school for dropouts (not its official name)
where I finished. He was a fiery red-headed man who, with his rich,
resonant voice threatening to burst the confines of the tiny
classroom, brought Donne and Shakespeare to dancing life.
</P>
<P>
   I want that magic for my son. How do we track it down?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, of course, is that I probably won't. It will be up
to him.

FIRST LADY, SPEAKING TO NAACP, TAKES AIM AT BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ohio, Va., Md.)   By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Hillary Rodham Clinton, blending her roles as a
Senate candidate and first lady, told the annual convention of the
NAACP here Tuesday that it should not be beguiled by the assurances
of Gov. George W. Bush that he abhors discrimination and is
committed to enforcing civil rights laws.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in for President Clinton, who had been scheduled to
appear Tuesday but was instead presiding over the Mideast summit
meeting at Camp David, Clinton did not mention Bush by name. But
she made it clear that her biting criticisms were directed at the
expected Republican presidential nominee, who appeared before the
convention on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said it was gratifying that the annual meeting of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People was
attracting the kind of political guests who had shunned the group
in the past, an allusion to Bush's appearance after Bob Dole had
declined to attend the group's convention when he was the
Republican nominee in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Even though someone may speak to you, Clinton told the
delegates, it is wise to ``watch what they do and not what they
say.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all for compassion,'' she said, lightly mocking Bush's
assertions that he understands the pain of discrimination. ``I
think it's wonderful when people feel `real bad' when there's
discrimination. It's fine when people say they are `truly
compassionate' about hate crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Clinton said: ``We need to move beyond mere compassion. We
need to move to conviction to do something so we can move beyond
the injustices of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   At times during her 35-minute speech, Clinton sounded very much
like her husband, using a down-home style to offer parables from
the Bible and drawing warm applause from the audience. She even
occasionally lapsed into a pronounced drawl, as in talking to ``mah
friends,'' only to revert to her flat ordinary speech. Vice
President Al Gore, the expected Democratic presidential nominee, is
to address the convention Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Bush received a surprisingly warm welcome on Monday, noting
wryly that his predecessors as Republican presidential nominees had
not always been eager to appear before the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Bond, the chairman of the board of the NAACP, told
reporters Tuesday that while the delegates were delighted that Bush
appeared, they were disappointed that he did not address specific
concerns like affirmative action or the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   He said that both Clinton and Ralph Nader, the Green Party
candidate, who also spoke to the convention Wednesday, offered
genuine substance in their talks, in contrast to Bush, who he said
``viewed his appearance as a photo opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she remembered how moved she was in 1963 when, as a
high school student, she heard a speech in Chicago by the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. His message that day to stay involved in the
civil rights revolution, she said, has stayed with her.
</P>
<P>
   She went on to note that she has recently taken a great interest
in how the Senate operates, an indirect reference to her campaign
for Senate in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, she said, the Republican-controlled Senate has
blocked consideration of four black nominees to federal appeals
courts. She said the Republicans were blocking votes on James Wynn
and Roger Gregory to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based
in Richmond, Va.; Johnnie Rawlinson to the 9th Circuit, based in
California; and Kathleen McGee Lewis to the 6th Circuit, based in
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell the United States Senate to let these nominees go,'' she
shouted.

 &HT;    Doherty gets job of a lifetime
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several years ago, when Matt Doherty decided he wanted to be a
head coach his mentor, Dean Smith, told him to ``find a job where
you can envision retiring.''
</P>
<P>
   Doherty thought he had done just that in March of 1999 when he
was named head coach at the University of Notre Dame. It seemed
like a perfect fit. He was an Irish Catholic kid from Long Island
whose grandmother had come from County Kerry, Ireland, just like
Bobby Cremins' parents. On the day he was named Notre Dame's coach,
Walter and Mary Doherty fought back tears as the proudest parents
on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt Doherty, Notre Dame _ that sounds like a fit,'' Mary
Doherty beamed to her son.
</P>
<P>
   When Doherty took Notre Dame to the NIT championship game and a
22-15 record in his rookie season as a head coach, he appeared set
for a long and successful run in South Bend.
</P>
<P>
   But then Smith, his basketball godfather, called and offered him
a job that he never dared dream about; the only job that would have
made him leave Notre Dame after only one year; the job of a
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   As painful as the exit from Notre Dame would be, as much as it
would hurt to say goodbye to something he had just begun to build,
Doherty had to bite his quivering lower lip Tuesday night and
gratefully take the keys to the college basketball dynasty that is
the University of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty, 38, has been in training for this day since 1980, when
arrived at North Carolina as a gangly 6-8 forward. He was a
McDonald's All-American, but in 1982 he was the starting forward on
a team that included Michael Jordan, James Worthy, and Sam Perkins.
He became the consummate role player on a team that went 32-2 and
beat Georgetown and Patrick Ewing for the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Playing with that kind of talent, Doherty still averaged 9.0
points over his career. When he left North Carolina, his 446 career
assists was third on the school's all-time list behind Phil Ford
and Jimmy Black.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't make it in the NBA and decided to give the real world
a try. He was a bond salesman in New York for a while and worked
for an executive search firm in Charlotte, N.C. Neither job got his
juices flowing the way basketball always had. He tried to scratch
the itch by working as an analyst with the Davidson basketball
network.
</P>
<P>
   He was warned by Smith and others. Don't coach unless it's
something that you absolutely have to do. He did.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty stayed in Charlotte and worked for three years as an
assistant at Davidson before another member of the Carolina family,
Roy Williams of Kansas, brought him to Lawrence in 1992. At Kansas,
Doherty got high marks for his attention to detail and his ability
as a recruiter. He signed nine high school All-Americans for the
Jayhawks. After seven years he was ready to be a head coach and,
thanks to recommendations from Smith and Williams, he got the job
at Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Some have wondered if the emotional Doherty is tough enough to
handle the slings and arrows that must be absorbed at the upper
echelon of Division I basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame's players have the answer. After losing an exhibition
game by 24 points, a newspaper headline called the team
``lackadaisical.'' He put a copy in every players' locker. After
304 windsprints, he vowed they would never lose again for lack of
effort. After Notre Dame upset No. 1 UConn last season, he dove
headfirst in the mass of bodies celebrating at the Joyce Athletic
Center.
</P>
<P>
   After three years of the underappreciated but low-key Bill
Guthridge, Doherty has been hired to bring the passion back to
Carolina basketball. He must to do that and also find a way to beat
a guy named Krzyzewski, who has his own dynasty just eight miles
down 15-501 in Durham.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty learned how to be a head coach from Williams. Williams
learned from Dean Smith. And Tuesday Doherty returned to Chapel
Hill to complete the circle.

 &HT;    Spurs' Duncan says he's going to remain with San Antonio
 &HT;    By Mark Rosner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Tim Duncan stepped up to a podium and back into
his life Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, a free agent pursued by the Orlando Magic, television
cameras and reporters for nearly two weeks, confirmed that he will
remain with the San Antonio Spurs, at least for a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking during a news conference at a San Antonio resort hotel,
Duncan and his attorney, Lon Babby, said details of a contract have
not been reached. Duncan appears to favor a three-year deal. NBA
rules allow him to sign for seven. Babby said a three-year contract
``is definitely a possibility.'' Duncan, who became a free agent
July 1, can not re-sign with the Spurs until Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, 24, gave no particular reason for remaining in San
Antonio, other than saying ``basketball'' was the biggest factor,
meaning he thinks the Spurs' have a better chance to win than does
Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   With his announcement, Duncan, a reluctant celebrity, can
finally throw people off his trail: The local TV station's
helicopter that hovered over his house. The sport utility vehicle
carrying media that followed him from the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It been a tough one,'' said Duncan, who was accompanied
Tuesday by his girlfriend, Amy Sherrill, and a close friend, Marc
Scott, as well as Babby. ``Orlando had a lot to offer. It was a
great visit down to Orlando and it made my decision a lot tougher
than I thought it was going to be. I just like what I have here. I
decided to stay here another couple of years as we work it out and
figure out what is going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs, 1999 NBA champions, feel the combination of Duncan
and David Robinson gives them the foundation they need to make a
run at dethroning the Los Angeles Lakers, who won the title in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to surround those two with more talent, the Spurs had
Derek Anderson, a free-agent guard from the Los Angeles Clippers,
in San Antonio Tuesday for a visit. The Spurs will also make a run
at Charlotte guard Eddie Jones, although salary cap restrictions
will make luring him difficult, if not impossible. The Spurs were
trying to attract Detroit's Grant Hill, who said he will sign with
Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   By signing a shorter contract than allowed, Duncan can monitor
how well the aging Spurs restock with younger players.
</P>
<P>
   Babby said Duncan was businesslike during discussions with the
Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think basketball is the primary thing. But he's had a
wonderful three years here, and wonderful relationships. I think
the burden was on some other place to encourage him to leave.
Orlando set an extremely high standard. To the credit of the Spurs,
they were able to meet and exceed that standard,'' Babby said.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan did not ask Spurs' Coach and General Manager Gregg
Popovich for guarantees about whom the Spurs would add to their
roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can promise you what is going to happen,'' Babby said.
``All you can do is try to put yourself in the best possible place
to accomplish your goals.''
</P>
<P>
   That is where Robinson was a factor. Though he turns 35 in
August and has a bad back and aching knees, Robinson has indicated
he wants to play another three years.
</P>
<P>
   Having the 7-foot-1-inch Robinson by his side allows Duncan to
play forward, a position he prefers. With the Spurs, the 7-foot
Duncan has only played center when Robinson is not in the game.
Duncan might have been stuck at center for Orlando, which has no
one close to the caliber of Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson and Duncan met for more than an hour last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just sat down and talked a little while, just to kind of
get on the same page, put some things on the table, see what kind
of answers came up,'' Duncan said. ``I liked the talk; I liked what
came out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Babby, ``Tim wanted to gather all the information on
David's plans and David's feeling about the future of this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Duncan does not reveal much of himself, he was touched by
the response from businesses and fans in San Antonio during the
last few weeks. Billboards featured the message ``Stay Tim Stay.''
H-E-B grocery stores distributed 300,000 placards saluting and
encouraging him. Even Popovich had placards and flags pasted to his
car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was incredible, beyond anything I expected,'' Duncan said.
``It was a bit overwhelming at times. But it was great. Very
flattering.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Duncan won't miss the helicopter or the news trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't even going to bring that up,'' he said. ``Since you
brought it up, it was rather annoying. I'm glad the process is
over. I hope people will stop following me.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, who injured his left knee April 11, is in the early
stages of rehabilitation. Duncan does not know if he will be able
to compete in the Olympics, which begin in mid-September. Training
camp opens Aug. 25.

`BIG BROTHER' BOUNCES BACK; MATT DAMON AND BEN AFFLECK WILL LAUNCH
`GREENLIGHT'; MILLIONAIRE'S EASY QUESTIONS, AND HARDER QUESTIONS ON
A NEW HISTORY QUIZ SHOW  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Md., Mich., Va.)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its biggest test, the new CBS reality series ``Big Brother''
rebounded with some promise on Monday night, once again leading in
the 8 p.m. time period.
</P>
<P>
   After its total audience sunk to about 6 million, the show,
which has placed 10 strangers in a house filled with cameras, came
back strongly on Monday, pulling in about 10.5 million viewers and
once again leading among young adult viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The performance was closely watched because weak ratings last
weekend and an overall downward trend in the number of people
tuning in had created some concern at CBS _ and hope at the other
networks _ that ``Big Brother'' might not grab the nation's
attention as had two previous reality series based on imported
models, ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and CBS's
``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother'' has been the riskiest reality show because it is
on five times a week. It started with an enormous initial rating
after CBS placed its first episode after its giant summer hit,
``Survivor.'' ``Big Brother'' had a natural decline in succeeding
nights, but by Saturday it was no longer even beating its
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a certain extent we were victims of our own success,'' said
Chris Ender, the spokesman for CBS Entertainment. ``Being after
`Survivor' set expectations so high.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS is now confident that ``Big Brother'' will settle in for a
successful run and will even build ratings as it begins bouncing
people from the house. That process begins Thursday night, when the
participants nominate two members for banishment; viewers will then
vote for a week on which one goes.
</P>

<P>
   GET REAL! (CONTINUED)
</P>
<P>
   The reality television juggernaut continues, now on cable, where
it actually began, with MTV's ``Real World'' and HBO's ``Taxicab
Confessions.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday HBO executives told television writers gathered in
Pasadena, Calif., for the twice-yearly Television Critics
Association tour that they were introducing a new reality show
produced by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, the screenwriting and
acting duo, who are also producing a reality show for ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``Greenlight,'' the new HBO show will follow the travails
and triumphs of a first-time filmmaker who is to be chosen from
among the thousands of everyday people HBO expects to respond to
its open call for screenplays, which will be submitted over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The show will track the filmmaker throughout the process of
making a small, independent-style film, which HBO, in partnership
with Miramax, will release in theaters at the end of the show's
run.
</P>
<P>
   Affleck and Damon will be seen in the series and will also be
executive producers of the film. But a representative from their
company, Pearl Street Productions, said they did not want to become
focal points of the series, which will not be shown on HBO until
early in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want it to be about Matt and Ben,'' said Kent Kubena,
vice president for development at Pearl Street. ``We want it to be
about the filmmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   So of course the filmmaker will not be chosen only on
screenwriting skills, but also on issues of personality, Kubena
said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second reality series that Damon and Affleck are
producing. They recently sold ABC a show called ``The Runner,'' in
which one contestant will embark on a cross-country trek during
which he or she will have to perform specified tasks while trying
to avoid being spotted by viewers.

   `PERU' PROMPTS PAYDAY
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' got its first chance to go
head to head with ``Big Brother'' last night, and once again its
timing was impeccable: the hit game show produced yet another
million-dollar winner, its sixth.
</P>
<P>
   This is less than a week after the show produced millionaire No.
5, who appeared on the first new ``Millionaire'' show after two
weeks of repeats.
</P>
<P>
   This confluence of competitively advantageous timing has begun
to raise at least a few eyebrows from the aggressively suspicious.
During a telephone news conference Tuesday the newest millionaire,
David Goodman from Olney, Md., was asked whether he had any
suspicions about the types of questions he was asked.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman, a consultant with an environmental company in Virginia
who recently received a master's degree in public policy from the
University of Michigan, said that he had watched the show avidly
and almost always did extremely well. In the case of at least one
earlier million-dollar winner, he said, he was certain he, too,
would have won that night.
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``It certainly helped a lot that the questions
were by and large things I could work with.''
</P>
<P>
   In one case, he said, he was asked about the derivation of the
name Lilith, and he was gratified that it related to something he
was familiar with, the first books of the Old Testament and what he
called ``Hebrew myth,'' as opposed to something in the New
Testament. ``Then I'd have been in trouble,'' Goodman said.
</P>
<P>
   That question was worth $250,000. The four choices: Lot's wife,
Adam's first wife, Helen of Troy, Muse of Lyric Poetry. He answer
was Adam's first wife.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman was so strong during the game that he did not need any
of the three lifelines the show affords contestants until he
reached the final question. He then won $1 million by knowing that
the British children's-book character Paddington Bear arrived in
England from Peru.
</P>
<P>
   He had already narrowed the four possible choices to two, the
other being Iceland. Then he got the audience members to vote, and
they only slightly favored Peru. So he phoned a friend who steered
him in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   _BILL CARTER
</P>
<P>
   NOW THE HARD STUFF
</P>
<P>
   The first signs of a possible intellectual backlash against the
simplicity of the questions on ``Millionaire'' became evident
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The History Channel announced at the writers' gathering in
Pasadena that it was going to begin its own game show this fall in
which contestants would face tough questions about history for
modest cash prizes.
</P>
<P>
   The cable channel's executives are billing the new production _
called ``History IQ'' and scheduled to begin in October on
weeknights at 7:30 _ as ``the thinking man's alternative'' to
``Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fair to say if you can answer a question on
`History IQ,' you must be pretty smart in that particular field,''
said the game show's host, Marc Summers. ``I think we're just a
little more cerebral than the contestants who may go on
`Millionaire.'''

AS PROBLEMS MOUNT, COLOMBIA'S PRESIDENT SHUFFLES CABINET 
</HEADLINE>
   By LARRY ROHTER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ In an effort to revive the Colombian
government's sharply declining political and economic fortunes,
President Andres Pastrana replaced more than a third of his cabinet
Tuesday, bringing in several figures associated with opposition
parties in hopes of dampening their campaign to cripple his
government.
</P>
<P>
   The long-anticipated cabinet reshuffle comes as the Clinton
administration is poised to begin delivering an emergency $1.3
billion aid package, composed mostly of military assistance, to
Colombia and neighboring countries. The money is intended to slow a
huge increase in cocaine and heroin production and thereby weaken
the finances of Marxist-Leninist guerrilla groups that have been
fighting the Colombian government since the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a cabinet of national unity, of great openness,'' said
Minister of the Interior Humberto de la Calle, himself a member of
the opposition Liberal Party who took office barely three months
ago. Of the 22 posts in the cabinet, slightly more than half are
now held by members of Pastrana's Conservative Party, with the rest
in the hands of Liberals and independents.
</P>
<P>
   Nine changes were announced as a result of the the shakeup,
which began Friday night with the resignation of Minister of
Finance Juan Camilo Restrepo. Planning Director Mauricio Cardenas
and Minister of Economic Development Jaime Cabal Sanclemente
stepped down Tuesday, meaning that all three of the government's
top economic leaders will be new.
</P>
<P>
   The reshuffle did not, though, affect the two officials who have
the most contact with the United States and are most closely
identified with the American aid package, part of a larger $7.5
billion counter-narcotics and social support program that Pastrana
calls ``Plan Colombia.'' Luis Fernando Ramirez Acuna remains as
minister of defense, while Guillermo Fernandez de Soto continues in
the foreign affairs portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   But the composition of the restructured cabinet pitches the
Pastrana government somewhat further to the left. The new minister
of labor, Angelino Garzon, for instance, is a former president of
the country's largest trade union federation and was also a vice
president of the Patriotic Union, a leftist political coalition
with links to leftist guerrillas that was all but wiped out by
paramilitary death squads in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider Angelino Garzon to be a friend of the labor
movement and wish him success in his new post,'' Julio Roberto
Gomez, president of the General Confederation of Democratic
Workers, a labor group that has often quarreled with Pastrana, told
a local radio station. ``We regard his appointment as a piece of
good news.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana took office two years ago next month with the highest
vote total ever recorded by a candidate for president of Colombia.
But he has been weakened, among other things, by an apparent lack
of progress in peace negotiations with the two main guerrilla
groups and by what economic analysts describe as the worst
recession in a century, with unemployment at 20 percent and the
peso at an all-time low against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to arrest that decline, this spring he proposed a
referendum to replace Congress, which is dominated by the Liberals
and is widely seen as corrupt and ineffective, with a new and
more-streamlined body. But the plan backfired, and Pastrana was
left with a poisoned relationship with Congress and a diminished
ability to govern, after legislators suggested that the president's
job be put to a vote as well.

FOUR WHO WORKED FOR DEOMCRATIC REFORM IN MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIA PRESTON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Luis Alvarez stopped eating for 40 days to protest
electoral fraud. Sergio Aguayo endured death threats for organizing
elections observers. Homero Aridjis, a prominent poet was
ostracized from official literary circles for exposing government
failures on the environment.
</P>
<P>
   To them the July 2 presidential vote, which ousted a
seven-decade old regime and elected an opposition leader, Vicente
Fox as president, was not just an election but another Mexican
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   It was the end of decades of ``lucha,'' or struggle, the dreamy
but stubborn pursuit of an ideal. In different ways, all kinds of
Mexicans came to believe that the omnipotent Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, could one day be toppled by the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexican democracy does not have one father or mother, it has
thousands,'' said Aguayo, an elections monitor. ``We each decided,
with our own intensity, to say no to submitting to the system.''
</P>
<P>
   The democracy movement was jolted to life after 1968 when
President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz sent army troops to fire on a Mexico
City student demonstration, killing dozens. It surged again after
1988, when Carlos Salinas de Gortari became president in a vote
that most Mexicans believe was stolen by the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Mexican democrats rejected Fidel Castro's call to
armed rebellion. While PRI governments preached nationalism, the
democrats looked to the 1960s civil rights movement and routine
transfer of power through the polls in the United States. The
movement grew through opposition political parties and civic
groups, the opening of an independent media and campaigns for clean
and fair elections.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a look at four Mexicans who dedicated years of work to
these purposes:
</P>
<P>
   Luis Alvarez, 80, Politician
</P>
<P>
   Although his friends thought he had lost his mind, Alvarez took
on the PRI back in 1958, when the system was at its apogee. He was
the presidential candidate of the National Action Party, or PAN,
now Fox's party. When Alvarez's caravan rolled in to one town, the
local PRI warlord greeted him by declaring he was under arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?'' Alvarez asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are an opposition presidential candidate. That's
illegal,'' the PRI leader responded, and threw him in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly the PAN began winning elections. The PRI, seeing the need
for some outlet for popular discontent with its rule, allowed the
opposition to keep victories that did not threaten its grip on
national power.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, however, the PRI decided that the governor's post in
the border state of Chihuahua was one it could not lose. PRI
operatives brazenly raided polling stations and stuffed fistfuls of
pre-marked ballots into the boxes. Alvarez, then the mayor of the
state capital, declared a hunger strike that lasted 40 days.
</P>
<P>
   His protest was widely echoed. Businesses in the state shut down
for 48 hours. Voters sat in to block border crossings to the United
States. President Miguel de la Madrid defended the ``patriotic
fraud,'' saying that the PRI could not allow a strategic border
state to fall to the PAN. The PRI won that vote but the world
became aware of its abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Today Alvarez is finishing a term as federal senator. With a big
smile, he called Fox's election ``a dream made real.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Aguayo, 52, Elections Monitor
</P>
<P>
   Aguayo's turning points were marked by three death threats he
received from the PRI regime.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager in the early 1960s in a working class barrio in
Guadalajara, he had fistfights with PRI student gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI's key word was loyalty,'' Aguayo recalled. ``To get
into politics you had to agree to be humiliated. I never did.''
</P>
<P>
   He was swept up in the pro-democracy student movement in Mexico
City in 1968. But when he tried to organize at home in Guadalajara,
armed PRI student squads came after him. Soon many of his friends
were driven underground to become leftist guerrillas. Aguayo
refused to join them. ``I thought taking up rifles was suicide and
would get us nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Since he did not hide, he was a PRI target and received his
first death threat. He fled back to Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   He became a college professor but used his spare time organizing
civic groups to defend Indians in the southern state of Chiapas.
The second threat was a handwritten note from the Chiapas security
police in 1981, telling him to leave the state. Aguayo realized
that Mexico needed groups to defend human rights, which PRI
governments spurned as the agenda of a meddling United States.
Three years later he helped found the Mexican Academy for Human
Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Offended by what seemed to be PRI fraud in the presidential vote
of 1988, Aguayo turned to elections monitoring. He modeled his
observer group, Alianza Civica, on the American civil rights
movement. By the 1994 presidential race, it was organized all over
the country.

   He got his third death threat, a detailed note indicating that
the sender knew all of his movements.
</P>
<P>
   This year Aguayo ran for Congress as a human rights candidate
from a splinter opposition party, and lost. But he is happy. ``At
the end of this 40-year story, we beat the authoritarian system, ``
he said, astonished. ``We won.''
</P>
<P>
   Elena Poniatowska, 67, Writer
</P>
<P>
   A feminist, Poniatowska is worried about what Fox, a Catholic
who opposes abortion, will do on women's issues. But she was
thrilled that the PRI was defeated peacefully. ``My people acted
nobly.''
</P>
<P>
   Descended from Polish royalty, Poniatowska started out in
journalism in the social pages of a Mexico City daily.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, friends told her to see for herself what Tlatelolco
Plaza in Mexico City looked like after the army broke up a student
demonstration. ``There was blood in the stairwells,'' she recalled.
``President Diaz Ordaz reacted to the students like a father who
slays a disobedient son by clubbing him over the head with a
chair.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican press largely omitted the student deaths.
Poniatowska wrote a book of personal accounts of the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984 she helped start La Jornada, a daily newspaper that
remains fiercely critical of the PRI. After a 1985 earthquake
leveled whole blocks in Mexico City, La Jornada was the only paper
that published her reports on the search for the dead and
corruption in public construction.
</P>
<P>
   Although the long student strike at the national university that
ended last February was unpopular, Poniatowska's columns helped
protect the leaders from abuse after police broke it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was younger my society friends told me that I did not
get invited anywhere because I was on the wrong side of the
fence,'' she said. ``I was always with strikers instead of
government ministers. Now I am sure that I was on the right side of
the fence.''
</P>
<P>
   Homero Aridjis, 60, Poet and Environmentalist
</P>
<P>
   Aridjis first fell out with the PRI system 18 years ago by
refusing to follow government order and cancel a poetry festival.
With Ted Hughes and Lawrence Ferlinghetti already in Mexico City,
he said, he went ahead and held an improvised festival anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``They started to block me,'' Aridjis said, recalling a time
when PRI governments had the power to decide which writers would
become famous. ``I ceased to exist as a poet.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, after a day of black asphyxiating smog over the capital
city, Aridjis rallied one hundred Mexican artists and intellectuals
to sign a declaration telling the government, ``This contamination
is killing us all.'' The petition gave birth to the Mexican
environmental movement, endowing it with extraordinary moral
authority. A few years later Aridjis' demand, for lead to be
removed from gasoline, was met by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Since then he has fought to protect Monarch butterflies,
protested the slaughter of sea tortoises, and battled for gray
whale sanctuaries, forging new ways of badgering the government and
letting himself in for new forms of harassment.
</P>
<P>
   This year's election, he said, opens up new possibilities for
his cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could never hope to have respect for the environment in
Mexico without democracy, without accountability,'' Aridjis said.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ Israeli and Palestinian leaders began their
fateful peace summit at Camp David on Tuesday with the far-reaching
goal of ending their 52-year-old conflict.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of an open-ended, tightly secluded meeting,
President Clinton ushered the leaders into the presidential retreat
where he hopes that the chemistry of the place and the moment can
induce a spirit of ``principled compromise'' that yields a
substantive peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the only one of the three leaders who spoke publicly on
Tuesday, talked in idealistic terms about securing a ``just and
enduring end'' to the conflict and about the ``gift of peace'' that
the leaders could give their children. But officials on all sides
acknowledge that a good, partial agreement would represent a
significant accomplishment and may be the only realistic end to
this fluidly scheduled, seat-of-the-pants-style summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, there is no guarantee of success,'' Clinton said at
the White House before flying to Camp David. ``But not to try is to
guarantee failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Arriving for their opening three-way meeting on Tuesday
afternoon, Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat did a smiley little dance at the entrance to
the Laurel Cabin at Camp David. It was a stubborn jig as each
sidestepped to try to make the other enter first into the crucible
of decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, with Barak's hand on his elbow, Arafat crossed the
threshold one beat ahead of the Israeli prime minister, who
constantly says that, ``It takes two to tango,'' for peacemaking to
work.
</P>
<P>
   The light-hearted but highly principled moment offered a glimpse
at the steely determination with which each Middle Eastern leader
is approaching the negotiating table, a rectangular one,
apparently, at which 21 American, Israeli and Palestinian delegates
sat on Tuesday to open their talks. But it was the only glimpse
offered into what the Americans, imposing a news blackout, are
trying to make an airtight environment safe from the pressures of
public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere is good, and the mood is serious,'' Joe
Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said. And that is about all he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials said on Tuesday night that they would
``resolve'' soon their dispute with the Clinton administration over
their $250 million contract to sell the Phalcon aircraft advanced
radar system to the Chinese. But Israel has been reluctant to
cancel the deal, which has soured relations between Israel and many
of its backers on Capitol Hill, and it is unclear what kind of
resolution they intend _ canceling, altering or postponing the deal
_ and whether they are linking it to progress at the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Under leafy boughs, and in cabins named for trees, the Israelis
and the Palestinians were transported far from the cramped, dusty
and conflicted Middle East into the expansive, verdant hills of
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Barak was far away from the political crisis that crippled his
government on Monday, and Arafat was nowhere near the demonstrators
who marched on Tuesday in the West Bank to demand that he not sell
them out.
</P>
<P>
   Barak was placed in the Dogwood Cabin, which President Anwar
Sadat of Egypt stayed in 22 years ago when the successful
Israeli-Egyptian peace summit opened to complete public skepticism
about what it could accomplish. Arafat was given the Birch Cabin
that Prime Minister Menahem Begin of Israel occupied then.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, in what seemed a vivid illustration of why the
Americans are imposing the news blackout, senior negotiators for
the two sides have expressed contrasting views of the possibilities
of achievement. Shlomo Ben Ami, the Israeli internal security
minister, said on Monday that he felt confident that an agreement
could be reached. Abu Ala, speaker of the Palestinian legislature,
said that he did not comprehend how Ben Ami could speak with such
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinian position will never change,'' Abu Ala said in
an interview with the Voice of Palestine. ``And the Israeli
positions have its well-known `no's.' So how can the minister talk
about an agreement?''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli television reported on Tuesday night that the Americans
want all the thorny issues _ borders, Jewish settlements in the
West Bank, Palestinian statehood, water, the fate of the
Palestinian refugees and the future status of Jerusalem _ to be
discussed in parallel at the talks.
</P>
<P>
   This would put Jerusalem, a seemingly irresolvable point of
contention, on the formal negotiating table for the first time in
the seven years since the Israelis and the Palestinians have been
talking.

RUSSIAN MEDIA CONGLOMERATE SEARCHED AGAIN BY AUTHORITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL WINES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Prosecutors searched the offices of Media-Most, the
nation's largest private media conglomerate, Tuesday for the second
time in two months, stepping up a criminal investigation that
skeptics call an effort to silence one of the Kremlin's few
prominent critics.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors also sought documents from Gazprom, the huge
state-run natural gas monopoly, which is Media-Most's biggest
financial supporter, apparently as part of a continuing inquiry
into the media company's finances.
</P>
<P>
   The raids took place one month after the prosecutors briefly
imprisoned the conglomerate's owner, Vladimir Gusinsky, in
connection with the same inquiry, which is said to involve an
allegation of financial impropriety in his purchase of a television
station from the government.
</P>
<P>
   They followed by days a series of confrontations between
Media-Most and the government, perhaps capped by a veiled reference
to Gusinsky in a ``state of the nation'' speech delivered on
Saturday by President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   In that speech Putin said unrestricted freedom of the press was
essential to Russian democracy. But he added that the main threat
came not from the government, but from tycoons who wielded their
newspapers and television stations against each other and, at
times, the state.
</P>
<P>
   A few other tycoons have media holdings. But Gusinsky's company
is the only media conglomerate to come under legal and financial
pressure from the government.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, agents of the Russian prosecutor general and the
Federal Security Service _ the heir to the KGB's domestic
intelligence activities _ served search warrants at the
headquarters of Media-Most and the offices of NTV, a subsidiary
that runs the nation's only independent broadcast network.
</P>
<P>
   They carted away a sheaf of financial documents from the
headquarters, Media-Most officials later said, but took only a list
of shareholders from the NTV office.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, shotgun-toting prosecutors and tax police
officers appeared at Media-Most headquarters in ski masks and
camouflage, staging a telegenic raid and search that many critics
then saw as a warning to Gusinsky to tone down his attacks on
Kremlin policies including the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor general's office said Tuesday that the latest
seizures were a routine part of its inquiry, which apparently
centers on Gusinsky's purchase of a St. Petersburg television
station in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy prosecutor general who is leading the inquiry, Vasily
Kolmogorov, said in a letter to Parliament last week that Gusinsky
had swindled the government out of at least $10 million in the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky has vigorously denied that, and has refused to answer
questions in what he calls a sham inquiry. In Tuesday's search,
investigators apparently focused on Media-Most's relations with
Gazprom.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Moscow city prosecutors announced that they had
arrested a reporter for a prominent NTV program on charges of drug
smuggling. NTV officials denied any connection to the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the best-known NTV commentator, Yevgeny Kiselyov,
delivered a broadside against Putin, accusing the president of
harboring imperial ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's role in all this, if any, remains obscure. He has said
he has no involvement in the prosecution of Gusinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But on a visit to Europe last month, he publicly questioned
Gazprom's financial support of Media-Most. Since then, Gazprom,
which is almost 40 percent owned by the government, has asked
Gusinsky to settle accounts. In all, Gazprom has guaranteed loans
to Media-Most totaling about $380 million.
</P>
<P>
   Several other of Russia's richest men came under fire Tuesday as
well. Tax authorities accused top executives at the nation's
biggest oil company, Lukoil Holding, of hiding company revenues
from taxation, the news agency Interfax reported. The company
denied the accusations, saying it got a clean bill of health from
the tax authorities last month.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the prosecutor general demanded that another
magnate, Vladimir Potanin, reimburse the government $140 million
for its sale of an undervalued stake in Norilsk Nickel, a mining
company. Potanin called the demand blackmail and asked for a court
hearing.

PROFESSOR LINKS ANIMAL ABUSE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN BOYANOSKI   
 Herald-Journal, Spartanburg, S.C.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPARTANBURG, S.C. _ A recent study by a professor at the
University of South Carolina-Spartanburg indicates that people who
abuse animals may be more likely to abuse family members as well.
</P>
<P>
   The research, by Clifford Flynn, a sociology professor, showed
that many times women in abusive relationships, and even their
abusers, viewed the animal as part of their family. He said he at
first found that odd, but then realized this was the link between
the two forms of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence in families is multidimensional,'' Flynn said. ``The
abuser will attack anybody for control, and if they believe the pet
is part of the family they will attack the pet as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Flynn performed his research in spring 1998 by questioning women
at an abuse clinic in Spartanburg County. He later did a second
survey with USCS students to solidify the research. He presented a
paper on the project in April to the Midwest Sociological Society
in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn said he found that violence against pets can be a random
act of aggression, like hitting the animal as it enters a room, or
it can take the form of abusing an animal for revenge on the other
person in the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another way for men to exert control in a relationship,''
Flynn said. ``They can use a pet as leverage. It's scapegoating.''
</P>
<P>
   Flynn said his research is part of a growing trend in sociology
in which researchers to try to find a link between human and animal
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a field that has really been ignored for years,'' Flynn
said. ``Animals are such a big part of our lives, and it doesn't
make sense not to look at them as part of our interactions.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his study also showed that women in abusive
relationships sometimes refused to seek help because of fears the
abuser would hurt the animal more.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn said that by looking for warning signs in animal abuse,
law enforcement agencies may be able resolve other problems. ``We
need to take animal abuse more seriously,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Clifton Richards was more than just a mailroom clerk. He tackled
the phones, mastered new software and bought supplies at the Social
Science Research Council, a nonprofit foundation where he worked in
New York. Always friendly, invariably dependable, he seemed to be a
true asset, his co-workers say. He even dressed better than many of
the staff, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Then, $650,000 in checks turned up missing over three months,
the foundation says, and the U.S. Postal Police were called in to
investigate. In March, Richards was charged with bank fraud,
accused of stealing 22 grant payments from the company's mail and
pawning them off to an intermediary for pennies on the dollar.
(Efforts to reach him or his lawyer for comment were unsuccessful.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, the shaken managers of the foundation are setting up
security protocols they never knew they needed. ``It's analogous to
what one would do when someone burglarizes your home,'' said Craig
Calhoun, the president. ``You change the locks; you put in a
burglary system. But that doesn't mean you're invulnerable or can
stop this from happening again.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in enterprises of all sizes and shapes, from shoestring
nonprofits to giant corporations, the scale of employee theft has
soared. Spurred by the gold-rush mentality of the late 1990s,
emboldened by technology and quick to prey on the loose financial
controls at start-ups and small companies, workers at every rung of
the corporate ladder are stealing more money than ever before,
fraud examiners say.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is unclear how much the number of incidents has grown,
a 1998 survey of 5,000 businesses, government agencies and
nonprofits calculated an average loss of $624,000 from check fraud
by employees, including forgeries and mailroom theft, nearly twice
the figure in a 1994 poll. The survey, by consultants for KPMG, the
accounting firm, also found that the looting of company bank
accounts by employees using ATM cards had more than doubled, to an
average of $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Theft and misuse of company credit cards by employees tripled,
to an average loss of more than $1.1 million, from 1994 to 1998,
the KPMG survey showed. And the average loss from employee expense
account abuse grew to $141,000, nearly seven times what it was four
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Fraud investigators say these statistics only scratch the
surface of a surge in workplace larceny. Anonymous surveys are one
thing. But, fearful of bad publicity, companies are loath to report
theft cases to law enforcement, masking a problem that has grown
alongside the soaring economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early 1980s, when I first started in this business, I
was not a very busy person,'' said Toby Bishop, a partner in the
fraud division at Arthur Andersen, the consulting firm. ``Today, I
can't handle all of what comes in the door.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, which is
based in Austin, Texas, conducted one of the nation's first
comprehensive studies on employee fraud in 1996, it reported that
companies typically lost 6 percent of their annual revenues to such
theft, roughly twice most earlier estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, in a survey of 587 fraud examiners, nearly 70
percent said that fraud levels had increased since the initial
report and that they expected the trend to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Fraud examiners attribute much of the recent wave of office
criminality to the stock market boom that has created hordes of
overnight millionaires and stirred impatience with the occasional
pay raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see the guy down the street who cashed in his stock
options and is now worth a million dollars, and you're still making
$30,000,'' said John Warren, general counsel of the fraud
examiners' group. ``It makes it easier to rationalize fraudulent
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the widening gap between executive and worker
compensation. Edward Wolff, an economics professor at New York
University, says corporate chief executives made an average 400
times what their average employees did in 1998, up from a ratio of
just 40 a decade earlier. The disparity in pay has fueled
discontent and eroded loyalty to such a degree that stealing on the
job is often seen as acceptable behavior, fraud investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be extremely rare that anyone would acknowledge
theft taking place,'' said Jim Baker, founder and president of
Baker Technologies Inc. in Rowlett, Texas, who has been
investigating fraud for 30 years. ``Now it's rare that we don't
hear of someone knowing about it. People have a cavalier attitude.
There's no shame attached to theft.''
</P>
<P>
   One consequence of the growth in such theft has been a large
gain in the number of fraud investigators. Membership in the
Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, the principal
professional group, has increased to about 25,000 from about 8,200
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see it as a growth industry,'' Warren, the general
counsel, said.
</P>
<P>
   Stealing often starts in the mailroom, a favorite haunt of
unscrupulous employees, investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a new employee, where do you stick them?'' said
Patrick Casey, a federal postal inspector and spokesman for the
postal police. ``The mailroom. That's often the lowest-paying job
in the corporation, yet a lot of the company's money goes through
there. Criminals sometimes seek out those jobs because they realize
they will have access to the ingoing and the outbound checks.''
</P>
<P>
   But workplace theft is costliest when committed by high-ranking
employees, who tend to have the most access to funds. According to
the fraud examiners' association, the median loss from crimes by
managers is $250,000, four times that of crimes by employees. And
the median loss from owners and executives is $1 million, 16 times
that of their employees.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, workplace thieves have become easier to catch.
Technology has expanded the arsenal of video cameras, decoys and
other tools used by fraud investigators. But computers, modems and
the Internet also offer employees new ways of tampering with
financial records, transferring funds and covering their tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a double-edged sword,'' said Bill Olsen, the mid-Atlantic
director for business fraud and investigation at Arthur Andersen.
``With the same technology we're using to detect and deter fraud,
there are people out there who are using it to commit crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many investigators also worry that a growing inattention to the
issue is making it easier for employees to steal. As labor
shortages threaten rapid growth, companies are becoming more likely
to forgo thorough background checks so as to speed up hiring.
</P>
<P>
   And with the pressure to post record earnings quarter after
quarter, many businesses have cut back on departments like
accounting and security that help detect theft but do not generate
revenue. Start-ups, racing to post profits, are particularly short
on checks and balances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internal controls are still very much viewed as cost
centers,'' said Richard H. Girgenti, director of investigations at
KPMG. ``What doesn't dawn on management is the connection between
money spent on fraud protection and the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even the most elaborate safeguards can fail. The Social
Science Research Council says, for example, that Richards came from
an employee agency that professed to do background checks. The
foundation itself has five accountants in a staff of just 50, an
unusually high ratio, even in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Richards has yet to stand trial on the federal charges. The
complaint says that he admitted taking the checks and that a teller
at Chase Manhattan Bank approved cashing them. Investigators say
they suspect that the teller deposited the stolen checks in false
accounts. The bank said it was looking into the matter and would
reimburse the foundation if any wrongdoing was uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation said it did not know anything was amiss until
students who had been awarded research grants started calling from
schools around the world, asking when the money would arrive. Then
it took weeks to track down the source of the thefts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scariest thing is that we kept watching it happen and it
kept coming,'' said Kristine Dahlberg, the foundation's chief
financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Inadequate staffing and an atmosphere of trust often make
nonprofits susceptible to theft, but investigators say that most
fraud still occurs at corporations, large and small, where money
and opportunities for fraud abound.
</P>
<P>
   Many regard the ever-increasing trend toward corporate mergers
as a prime opportunity for white-collar criminals. ``When merging
with companies that have different profiles, management's eyes are
off the ball,'' said David Sherwin, a partner with Ernst &AMP; Young
who oversees the company's fraud surveys. ``There is no real status
quo anymore. The old benchmarks are no longer valid, so it becomes
easy for fraud to go undetected.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Albrecht, associate dean at the Marriott School of
Management at Brigham Young University, says that in his
consultations with national banks, he noticed fraud levels rising
33 percent a year from 1996 to 1998. As huge mergers become common
and layoffs ensue, Albrecht said, employees cease to identify with
the companies they work for, developing a sense of detachment that
makes theft simpler to justify.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employees are not viewed as long-term investments; they're
viewed as short-term assets that can be bought and sold,'' Albrecht
said. ``As a result, there's not the allegiance to the organization
that there used to be.''

<P>
   Insinuating its way into a summer of movies of negligible
ambiguity _ many are the attractions of ``Gladiator,'' ``The
Patriot'' and ``The Perfect Storm,'' but their ability to provoke a
tentative, questioning mood in the viewer is not among them _ comes
one of the major chew bones of this year's Sundance Film Festival,
``Chuck and Buck.'' The movie, which was scheduled to open July 14,
is about boyhood friends who re-encounter each other after many
years; Chuck has gone on to become a Los Angeles record company
executive, professionally accomplished and successfully affianced,
while Buck hasn't gone on to anything except a huge case of
arrested development, a large part of which involves keeping the
memory of their boyish sex play burning like an eternal flame. It's
a movie that careers into one cringe-inducing circumstance after
another: The sexuality of children, the old relationship that will
not die, the overweening confidence of jerks, the cruelty of the
panicked, the geek who will not go away. And it's a comedy!
</P>
<P>
   Written by Michael White, it also stars Michael White. ``What
people create is a fulfillment of a wish that we are conscious of
or unconscious of,'' said the Freudian White.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this in other people's movies, and sometimes you wonder
whether moviemaking is anything more than that. It's like all they
want to do is see Sharon Stone uncross her legs, and the whole
movie is built around that moment.'' Audiences will note that White
did not take the competent, has-his-act-together Chuck part, but
the goofy, pathetic, disruptive Buck part. ``Chuck and Buck'' is,
of course, fiction _ of course it's fiction _ but it's hard to
think of anyone in recent years who's made as riskily revelatory an
artistic statement as Michael White.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd always felt sort of oppressed by images of perfection,''
said White, 29, who features within his credit-packed writing
career two seasons on the perfect-teen television series ``Dawson's
Creek.'' ``Perfect people living perfect lives, the Aaron Spelling
version of things that just infiltrates Hollywood generally. And so
when I see people on TV or in the movies who are more misfits, I
feel that's sort of healing, to see that there are people like you
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   White traces his empathy to his upbringing. He was raised in
northern California in a religious household. His father, Melvin
White, is a clergyman who was the ghostwriter of books for Jerry
Falwell, Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker, Pat Robertson and Billy Graham.
The Whites went to a fundamentalist summer camp, where in the
mornings campers would lift their arms in the air and practice the
rapture they'd feel at the Second Coming _ fundamentalist
calisthenics. Several years ago, after he had finished putting his
two children through college, the elder White came out of the
closet and became a gay activist, critical of the religious right
for its intolerance toward gays. He had, however, come out to his
family a decade before. ``My dad ended up having to stay closeted
and my parents had to pretend they were still married'' _ they are
now divorced _ ``and he had to keep taking these jobs to basically
keep me in school. It was a very tortured extended experience for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   White's father recalled that Michael went his own way, even as a
child. ``Mike is a kid who refuses to do what's anticipated,''
Melvin White said. ``He refuses to play with the common paradigms.
I remember him saying to me, `You're not gay, that's just a
construct that limits you.' That's when he was 16.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael White, who is tall and thin, with a reedy voice, hair
like strawberry blond grass and eyeballs drawn by Dr. Seuss, said
the idea for ``Chuck and Buck'' came to him after several years of
living a writerly existence in Hollywood and feeling frustrated
both socially and creatively. ``The social side,'' he said over
dinner in Manhattan late last month, ``was always about putting
your best face forward, meeting people, getting work, being in the
mix, being liked. Creatively, there was the frustration of going
through the development process in both TV and the movies.
`Dawson's Creek' was such a show about people who were beautiful
and articulate. And so much of development is about: `How do you
make this character more likable? How are you going to fall in love
with them quicker in the movie?' `Chuck and Buck' is about a
reaction to that destructive way of creating a script. I thought,
`I'm going to create a character who has all the characteristics of
what you hope you aren't.''' He set up an alter ego struggle: Chuck
is the handsome, successful character you project to the world, and
Buck is the character who's confused and a nuisance and has nothing
to offer. ``And I really wanted to tap into the Buck side,'' White
said.
</P>
<P>
   What obviously gives the movie its tension, both comic and
dramatic, is Chuck and Buck's old sexual relationship, something
Chuck wants to hide as much as Buck wants to revive. As his father
would say, White has refused to play with common paradigms.
``There's been a lot of hi-jinxy mainstream Hollywood comedies,
like `What About Bob?' or `The Cable Guy,' '' White said, ``where
the undercurrent of homoeroticism is a central part of where the
comedy comes from. I wanted to push the envelope. And there's also
the mainstream version of the character with arrested development,
a Rain Man or a Forrest Gump, a character who's a touchstone
through which people access the child in themselves. But these
characters are idealized. I was thinking, all people have
sexuality. There was a kid in my neighborhood who had Down
syndrome, and everyone went out of their way to be inclusive and to
be sensitive to his needs. But the minute he would grab my sister
or fondle her inappropriately, immediately all the good intentions
would cave in. And to me, it was kind of comical.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The resultant screenplay _ about characters you like, feel for,
dislike and are dismayed and repelled by, pretty much all at once _
was, in White's word, polarizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People not only told me they wouldn't finance it,'' he said,
``but their reactions were hostile. They were, like: `Why are you
doing this? Why do you want to make this? But a lot of people loved
the script.'' One of them was Miguel Arteta, the director of the
critically acclaimed indie ``Star Maps'' (1997). ``Movies about
obsessed people usually end in bloodbath,'' Arteta said. ``Mike
shows that Buck is just a character with a big hole in his heart
that he's trying to fill.'' Arteta quickly agreed to direct the
screenplay and took the project to Open Cities, a New York-based
production company that wants to foster artistic freedom, and it
underwrote filming.
</P>
<P>
   Then came casting. White, who acted at Wesleyan University in
Middletown, Conn., and has had tiny parts in films and on
television, seems to enjoy performing, especially in scenarios of
his own invention. His father said: ``Mike gave me and my partner
his Toyota 4Runner so we could make trips to the Home Depot, and he
bought himself a Lincoln Town Car, with the dark windows and
everything, and a chauffeur's hat. And he wears the hat when he
drives himself around. `Dad,' he says, `It feels like I'm always
going to the airport.'''
</P>
<P>
   White had harbored a desire to play Buck even as he was writing:
``It felt like it would be a challenge to play Buck, a way of
engaging with the material in a more intensely creative way. And
because the movie is about alter egos inside you that you're afraid
to show, I thought it would be very gutsy for me to just go for
it.'' And besides, he added, ``I really never thought anyone would
see the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   He can no longer remember whether it was he or Arteta who
actually floated the idea first, but he was cast promptly,
particularly after Arteta cast the Weitz brothers, Chris and Paul,
the makers of ``American Pie.'' Chris plays Chuck, and Paul _ pay
attention now _ portrays an actor who is playing a character in a
play who is based on Chuck. ``It was an amazing, funny, fluent,
confident script that didn't succumb to any of the usual cliches,''
Chris Weitz said. ``But to be truthful, I told Miguel I'd do the
part even before I read it.''
</P>
<P>
   White's performance, Arteta said, turned out to be compelling:
``Emotionally, he's telling you exactly what's going on at all
times. You know, he had to cry a lot in that movie, and whether it
was a tight shot or a wide shot, he went for it every time. Then he
went home depleted.''
</P>
<P>
   Being the front man for this movie has been strange, White said:
``It did seem like it was generating a lot of discussion at
Sundance. After spending years on stuff that was palatable and easy
to digest, I felt this is finally what I intended. People were
talking about sexuality, about relationships, taking different
sides. That's the most exciting part of writing, when the story
lingers beyond the telling of it in discussion and debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the debut of ``Chuck and Buck,'' White has been sent
screenplays with parts earmarked for him. ``Much like you'd
expect,'' he said, ``dumb bananas and computer whizzes.'' He said
he was interested in acting again _ ``I should take a part in an
action movie, just so when people see my performance in `Chuck and
Buck,' they'll say, `Oh, he's acting.''' Right now, however, he is'
focused on writing. He's at work on two pilots and two screenplays
for the producer Scott Rudin, and is hopeful that financing will
come through for another screenplay he has done for Arteta, which
he describes as `` `Madame Bovary' meets `Raising Arizona.'''
</P>
<P>
   And he's still jazzed about ``Chuck and Buck'': ``If I had just
written it, I would feel proud. But because I'm in it, it's just
weird for me. Because now people have reactions not only to the
movie but to me, personally. A lot of people really want to engage.
A lot of them want to, like, tell you their own story, and I don't
really want to be the receptacle for all the insanity this movie
may provoke. And clearly I'm also leaving myself open to a lot of
speculation and discussion. I was in a restaurant the other day,
and someone came up to me and said, `I saw your movie, and I have
just one question _ is it autobiographical?' And I thought, `Be
careful what you wish for.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's been so interesting to create an alter ego of
yourself, one that's what you're most afraid of showing to the
world, and to do it on such a big scale. In L.A., people put their
best face forward and get accepted, but how meaningful is that? But
if you put your most twisted and vulnerable side forward and people
accept or don't accept it, it just feels more intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a meaningful experience. It feels so naked.''

HOLOCAUST FICTION TURNS OUT TO BE FACT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Md., Tenn., Germany)   By RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was, critics said, one of the more harrowing Holocaust
novels, a prominent German writer's stark tale of a Jewish stamp
dealer's hairbreadth escapes from the Nazis, in the end hidden in
the subcellar of a cooperative Ukrainian.
</P>
<P>
   But to Jakob Littner, that was no novel. That was his life.
</P>
<P>
   Now a professor's literary sleuthing has stripped away a veneer
of fiction from the work, ``Jakob Littner's Notes from a Hole in
the Ground,'' published in 1992 by the German writer Wolfgang
Koeppen, and given the book new standing as fact.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, said the professor, Reinhard Zachau, chairman of the
German department at the University of the South in Sewanee, Tenn.,
Koeppen appropriated Littner's memoir after assisting its first
brief publication in Germany in 1948. Littner died in New York in
1950. Koeppen who had achieved literary fame in the 1950s with a
trilogy of novels about Germany's postwar struggles, died in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Now, largely based on Zachau's research, Littner's original book
has been published for the first time in English, and once again as
nonfiction and as Littner's own work. Under his original title,
``Journey Through the Night,'' it was published in June by the
Continuum International Publishing Group of New York and London.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there have been several Holocaust `memoirs' that have
been unmasked as fictions,'' Continuum said in a statement, ``this
is perhaps the first time that a Holocaust `novel' turns out to be
a fabrication based minutely on a genuine Holocaust memoir.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to complaints from Littner's survivors in 1993,
Thomas Sparr, an editor at Koeppen's publisher, Juedischer Verlag,
a Jewish subsidiary of Suhrkamp Verlag, one of the largest German
publishing houses, wrote that the company ``never denied but rather
confirmed that the book contains'' Littner's ``Notes.'' Koeppen
``gave the notes an adequate form,'' he said, and acknowledged
Littner in the title. But the designation of novel was later
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Yet scholars and Littner's relatives fault Koeppen's book as
misleading. ``There was gross misrepresentation involved in calling
the work a novel,'' said Zachau, who tracked down Littner's
original manuscript. ``And then there was something more subtle,
the perpetuation of changes Koeppen made 40 years earlier when he
took liberties with a straightforward if terrifying narrative to
make it into something more literary and mythic, something more
aesthetic.''
</P>
<P>
   A Hungarian-born Polish citizen, Littner was living with his
family in Munich when the war sent him fleeing back to Poland and
then to Zbaracz near Tarnopol, in Ukraine, where the SS was killing
Jews. His son and daughter-in-law were trapped in the besieged
Warsaw ghetto and sent anguished pleas for food until the letters
abruptly stopped. Littner's wife and sisters were also killed by
the Germans. But Littner was secretly sustained by a Christian
woman, Christine Hintermaier, who was his partner in the stamp
business.
</P>
<P>
   Littner; the woman who would become his second wife, Janina; and
another son, Richard, found refuge in a vault under the cellar of a
Ukrainian's house, for which they paid extravagantly, in one case
with gold bridgework that Littner tore from his mouth. After nine
months all but buried alive, the three were liberated in March
1944.
</P>
<P>
   Littner emigrated to New York in 1947, his manuscript in the
hands of a Munich publisher. Koeppen later said he was retained to
work on the book in exchange for food packages from Littner,
although when the book, ``Notes from a Hole in the Ground,'' came
out in a small printing in Germany in 1948, only Littner's name was
on it as the author.
</P>
<P>
   But Koeppen had made changes. Where Littner had issued a plea
for forgiveness and written, ``It is not for people to judge
others,'' Koeppen _ in Littner's voice _ had gone further, calling
Nazism's crimes ``beyond human judgment,'' a liberty that one
critic called ``Aryan chutzpah.''
</P>
<P>
   The texts of the 1948 and 1992 books were the same, Zachau said,
but Koeppen had added an introduction in which he claimed
authorship. ``I ate American rations and wrote the story about the
suffering of a German Jew,'' Koeppen wrote. ``In doing so it became
my story.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptical, Zachau tracked down a relative of Littner's in
Maryland, Kurt Nathan Gruebler, a retired engineer, who had a copy
of Littner's original manuscript and authorized its publication.
Gruebler's name appears on the cover of the new book, and he is
credited as its translator and editor.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Koeppen, as a German gentile and literary talent, just
felt the need to buttress Littner's memoir, said Zachau. But he
added, ``probably the best way to come to grips with Nazism would
simply have been to let Jakob Littner speak for himself.''

 &HT;    FBI agent testifies he wasn't trying to demolish Branch Davidian
building
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas - An FBI agent denied Tuesday that he was trying to
demolish the gymnasium at the Branch Davidians' compound seven
years ago when he repeatedly drove a tank through it.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Harris told U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. and the
advisory jury hearing the Branch Davidians' $675 million
wrongful-death lawsuit against the government that he was trying to
create a ``driveway'' so a second tank equipped to deliver tear gas
could reach the another area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a haphazard, just run up and smash and crash
things,'' Harris told government co-counsel Michael Bradford.
</P>
<P>
   Tearing down the Mount Carmel gymnasium was not his mission,
Harris testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job was to create a path,'' he said. ``I was not trying to
destroy that part of the building or to crash the roof.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs allege that FBI commanders prematurely began
disassembling Mount Carmel to force out the Davidians. However,
Harris said he drove through the gymnasium rather than try to skirt
the Davidians' outdoor pool with a 60-ton tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to end up in that pool upside down or even
worse,'' said Harris, now head of the SWAT team for the FBI's
Atlanta field office.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford asked if that would have resulted in the crew drowning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty much,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's infrared (FLIR) videotape from April 19, 1993 showed
the combat engineering vehicle driven by Harris seesawing through
the Davidians' gymnasium shortly after 11 a.m. Harris testified
that the FBI wanted to put tear gas into the base of the tower at
Mount Carmel. It was believed Davidian leader David Koresh had gone
to the bunker there to escape the tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   However, Harris said he soon realized that reaching the tower
via the gymnasium wouldn't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could tell it would not be as simple as putting a hole in
the wall,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the gymnasium was used as a storage area and was full of
``junk'' that hampered the vehicle's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Caddell, lead plaintiffs attorney, pressed Harris on
whether the vehicle penetrated the back of the gymnasium. The FBI's
FLIR tape at one point shows materials blown out the back of the
gymnasium into the courtyard adjoining the tower.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe the CEV was at the back of the wall,'' Harris
said. ``That pile of debris I was pushing had knocked the wall
out,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he didn't plow through the debris and into the
courtyard out of caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we made the penetration, one of the things we thought we
saw was a drop-off,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said he didn't have a intelligence report telling him
there was no drop-off in the courtyard, so he tried to find another
path through the gymnasium. Eventually half the gymnasium collapsed
as well as a walkway just under the roof line called the dog run.
</P>
<P>
   A portion of the FLIR later showed Harris' tank ramming the
section of the gymnasium that had not collapsed. Harris said it was
an accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've looked at this many times,'' Harris said. ``I actually
believe I was trying to turn around and ran into the building.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell noted that the FBI's operation plan called for ripping
through the outer walls of Mount Carmel if inserting tear gas for
48 hours failed to dislodge the Davidians. Then he asked Harris if
there would have been any of the gymnasium left to demolish if the
Davidians had stayed inside for two more days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can make that determination,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris told Caddell that he wasn't aware of any rotation plan
for the Hostage Rescue Team despite its launching upon a tactical
operation scheduled to last 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were you told you'd be in a tank for 48 hours?'' Caddell
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we were not told about a shift change,'' Harris said. ``We
were told in 48 hours we would peel the walls back so hopefully the
people inside would come out.''
</P>
<P>
   The government won an opening courtroom battle Tuesday when
Smith allowed it to read the portions of Derek Lovelock's
deposition in which he invoked the Fifth Amendment rather than
repeat phrases like ``Pour the fuel'' and ``Light the fire.'' They
were among the phrases picked up on audio surveillance devices
inside Mount Carmel on the day of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Lovelock was one of nine Branch Davidians to survive the fire
that led to the deaths of Koresh and 75 followers.
</P>
<P>
   Smith told members of the advisory jury that they could draw a
``negative inference'' from Lovelock's refusal to say the phrases
into a tape recorder. However, Smith also reminded the jury that
Lovelock had not been charged with a crime in connection with the
fire at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic chemist Andrew Armstrong of Arlington, Texas testified
that clothing samples from Davidian survivors as well as soil
samples from the burned compound tested positive for gasoline,
kerosene, charcoal lighter fuel and camp stove fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong worked with the fire investigation team that
determined the fire was intentionally set and accelerants were used
to speed the flames.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell contested his testimony, pointing out that some shoes
and clothing contain petroleum products. He also rattled off a list
of items from Mount Carmel examined by Armstrong _ delivered to his
laboratory in sealed cans _ that showed no traces of combustible
liquids.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong acknowledged he could not prove any of the Davidian
survivors set Mount Carmel on fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing the chemist can say is what is in the can,''
Armstrong said. ``The chemist cannot identify the action of the
person who is associated with the crime.''
</P>
<P>
   He also agreed that he could only state that the residue found
on a piece of clothing was from a certain family of fuels, which
might range from camp stove fuel to paint thinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot say it is camp stove fuel,'' Armstrong said. ``But it
has the characteristics of camp stove fuel. It is the closest
match.''

   Power and passion: The Bolshoi Ballet's dancing has been
synonymous with these qualities, making it a company like no other.
Virtually sold out for its appearances at Lincoln Center Festival
2000 this week, as it was for its recent five-city U.S. tour, the
fabled troupe from Moscow returns to New York for the first time in
10 years, and with its potent mystique intact.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, as Aleksei Fadeyechev says: ``It is a different
company now. Each time chooses its own dancers.'' Fadeyechev, who
was one of the Bolshoi stars in 1990, was made the ballet troupe's
artistic director in 1998 by Vladimir Vasiliev, the superstar named
to the new and double post of general and artistic director of the
entire Bolshoi Theater in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   By ``different,'' Fadeyechev, interviewed during the tour last
month in Washington, was referring to a way of dancing, not the
company's vicissitudes since Yuri Grigorovich, its pre-eminent
choreographer, was forced out as artistic director in a power
struggle. In 1990, Grigorovich was at the helm and dancers like
Fadeyechev still danced in the Bolshoi's heroic manner.
</P>
<P>
   This thrilling style, epitomized earlier by Vasiliev's muscular
bravura, has yielded to a more contemporary and classical look, in
Fadeyechev's view. The dancers are slimmer now and have been
influenced by Western models.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bolshoi dancing retains its dynamic imprint _ what
Fadeyechev calls ``expressiveness with a spiritual springboard,''
reaching beyond technique to uplift the viewer. Traditionally the
company has been more willing to break the rules of academic style
than its rival in St. Petersburg, the Kirov Ballet. The latter's
dancing was pure, all could agree, but the Bolshoi's was more
exciting.
</P>
<P>
   Like most cliches, this appraisal holds true _ as Americans saw
recently in two Bolshoi signature pieces, ``Don Quixote'' and
Leonid Lavrovsky's ``Romeo and Juliet.'' Nonetheless there have
been changes. The company has brought a generation of young dancers
new to New York. Thanks to the freedom of the post-Communist era,
George Balanchine's ballets, once frowned upon because they had no
stories, have been added to the programming.
</P>
<P>
   When the Lincoln Center Festival presents the troupe at the New
York State Theater from July 18 through July 23, Vasiliev's staging
of ``Giselle'' will open the run.. The second program, a mixed
bill, includes Balanchine's ``Symphony in C.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Kirov, which performs other Balanchine works, the
Bolshoi has no resident choreographer and is in search of a
repertory. But unlike the Kirov Ballet, whose head, Oleg
Vinogradov, was replaced by a de facto director after a financial
scandal, the Bolshoi seems to thrive on internal dissension.
</P>
<P>
   As a general administrator who is also, unlike his predecessors,
artistic director of the entire Bolshoi, Vasiliev has a major role
in running its opera and ballet troupes. Having the equivalent of
two artistic directors for ballet means built-in tension, which
manifested itself when Vasiliev lost his first ballet director,
Vyacheslav Gordeyev, in 1997. Aleksandr Bogatyrev died soon after
serving briefly as interim ballet director. Fadeyechev noted that
Vasiliev ``decides on the repertory for the entire theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Nina Ananiashvili, the Bolshoi ballerina who dances
regularly with American Ballet Theater, is known to have urged the
staging of the Balanchine works ``Mozartiana,'' ``Agon,''
``Symphony in C'' and, next season, ``Bugaku.'' Fadeyechev restaged
``Don Quixote'' and said it was his idea to invite the French
choreographer Pierre Lacotte to choreograph, in 19th-century style,
a version of ``The Pharaoh's Daughter,'' a nearly forgotten ballet
by Marius Petipa.
</P>
<P>
   Vasiliev, interviewed separately in Washington, spoke proudly of
the Bolshoi range. Its two poles this year were symbolized by the
contemporary dance-drama of Boris Eifman's ``Russian Hamlet'' (seen
in New York with the Eifman company) and the pageantry of ``The
Pharaoh's Daughter,'' acclaimed for its spectacular cascade of
classical dances. Vasiliev has, however, been criticized in the
press as an administrator and for his stagings of opera and ballet,
notably ``Swan Lake.'' Reports in Russian magazines suggest he is
on the way out.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, he is in a vulnerable position, having been
directly appointed by the former president, Boris Yeltsin, when the
Bolshoi, the Kirov, the Hermitage Museum and a few other museums
were classed as national institutions directly responsible to the
president. Whatever presidential protection was available to the
directors of these institutions is now in doubt. They have just
been returned to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Culture.
</P>
<P>
   Under a proposal from Valery Gergiev, director of the Kirov
theater, the Bolshoi and Kirov theaters would be united under one
administration, as in the Office of Imperial Theaters in czarist
days. Since Gergiev would obviously be at the head of this joint
administration, the Bolshoi's defenders predict that this would
spell the end of one of the companies, and they will make sure that
it is not the Bolshoi.
</P>
<P>
   The Kirov ``is a wonderful company,'' Fadeyechev said. ``But
it's the second company.'' The Kirov corps was once supreme, he
added, ``but you will see in `La Bayadere,' ours is now the best.
Our company has changed and has more precision and clarity.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the more emotionally profound style of the past,
Fadeyechev added: ``I admired the old style and regret that it is
gone, but style develops. The point of the Moscow school is that it
is a tradition passed down from person to person, not by videotape.
Marina Semyonova started in Leningrad, but she was a Bolshoi
ballerina and she still coaches at 92. She is part of the history
of the Bolshoi.''
</P>
<P>
   The ballet masters Fadeyechev has put into place are credited by
many in the company with having raised the overall level. They
include his father, Nikolai Fadeyechev, the eloquent danseur noble
who partnered Maya Plisetskaya in the 1950s and 1960s, and Boris
Akimov, remembered for his passionate performances in the 1970s.
They are the inheritors of a specifically Russian tradition, in
Fadeyechev's view.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bolshoi is part of international culture,'' he said, ``and
not a minor part. Yet it is a Russian theater because it also
embodies Russian culture. Nina Ananiashvili dances abroad but her
schooling is Russian.''
</P>
<P>
   Illustrating with a detail, he agreed that Bolshoi ballerinas
like to throw both arms upward in a jete although textbook style
would have them lower.
</P>
<P>
   When you throw your arms up in a jete, you get an effect. It's
expressive, not for show but for what you feel inside. Yes, it is
part of a tradition. The little nuances that make up ballet style
consist of where your arm is, what is your speed, what preparations
you make for a step or how expressive you are. Ours is a big open
style. We were taught to cover the full stage in a leap.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the Bolshoi has lost fewer dancers to the West than
the Kirov in St. Petersburg after the the fall of Communism,
Fadeyechev replied with a smile, like a true Muscovite: ```Have you
ever tried to live in Petersburg?'' For many, Moscow is the more
exciting city. ``The atmosphere is better in our company,''
Fadeyechev said. The Bolshoi dancers have also made more use of a
new contract system that permits guest appearances abroad. Even
Fadeyechev has a contract. The latest is for one year, and he
wonders aloud how he can plan a repertory under these conditions.

SOLITARY PERFORMER   ON A CROWDED STAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Germany, Spain)   (For release Sunday, July 16)  
 By   HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Though John Hejduk was little known outside the world
of architecture, his influence exceeded that of many of its most
prominent figures. His death earlier this month, at 71, leaves a
profound emptiness _ a quality that, as it happens, Hejduk often
reflected on in his work. Like many gifted architects, he was a
contradictory figure: a solitary artist who chose to work in a
highly social form of art. But he had a particular way of living
out the contradiction. Instead of constructing social spaces with
bricks and mortar, he fashioned one from ideas and emotions and
peopled it with students and faculty members of the school he led
for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   That institution, the Irwin S. Chanin School of Architecture at
the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, must be in
shock. The school had just begun to adjust to Hejduk's retirement
as dean, announced only weeks before his death. Cooper Union
without John Hejduk? Inconceivable. Even the Bauhaus was not as
closely identified with its founder, Walter Gropius, as Cooper
Union came to be with Hejduk.
</P>
<P>
   There stood, in one of Cooper's hallways, a large plaster model
of the Pantheon, and the big white dome (you could stick your head
in it) seemed to symbolize the hold of Hejduk's mind over his
students and faculty. Those who entered the school's Foundation
Building, remodeled by Hejduk in 1975, were essentially walking
into the architect's psyche, to have their brains remodeled as
well.
</P>
<P>
   He took architecture inside, too. Interiority is what bound this
tall, singular fellow to his contemporaries. He was one of a group
of architects whose work has punched holes in the wall between our
outer and inner worlds. Ordinarily, architecture reinforces that
wall. Compared with writing, painting or music, architecture is
typically seen as an art that operates ``out there.'' It is a
material art. It accommodates people and their social behavior. It
is not confined by the frames, prosceniums, book covers and other
devices that separate art from daily life.
</P>
<P>
   Hejduk took a different route. Along with Aldo Rossi, Frank
Gehry, Rem Koolhaas and others, he helped to break down the
separation by asserting that personal expression is a legitimate
response to urban context. This is one of the lessons Hejduk
imparted to his disciples.
</P>
<P>
   Even compared to them, however, his individuality remained
extreme. Whether or not he ever set his heart on building in the
material world, at some point he let that goal slip away. Instead
of reckoning with the pragmatic considerations and compromises of
conventional practice, he dedicated himself almost entirely to a
dual practice of running a school and making architecture in the
form of drawings.
</P>
<P>
   The pivotal project in his architectural work was ``Wall House
I,'' a design for a three-story house hanging off a five-story
wall, which he began in 1974. From the drawings and models, it is
evident that he saw this as a buildable project. It includes
structural supports, habitable spaces and essential functions and
takes its name from its central element: a concrete wall five
stories high, somewhat larger in width. One model suggests that the
rear of the wall is backed with reflective steel. On the front, a
bean-shaped elevator core supports the wall, from which a staircase
and three floors of living space are cantilevered.
</P>
<P>
   The project should not be seen as an exercise in structural
calisthenics. It is, rather, a meditation on the border between
public and private space. The design compresses the private
dwelling from a box to a plane. The compression isolates the
division of private and public. The cantilevered floors, horizontal
planes, create semi-private zones within. The open staircase,
extruded through the wall, is semi-public.
</P>
<P>
   The design was prophetic. It anticipated our national debate
over the relationship between public and private realms.
Ordinarily, when we use the term visionary architect, we mean
someone who creates strictly imaginary worlds. In the case of the
``Wall House,'' the term can be used factually. Hejduk set forth an
issue that in 1998 hijacked the Oval Office, turning privacy into
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   From here, his work pivoted into the visionary as the term is
more conventionally construed. Some buildings would come: a housing
complex in Berlin; part of a cultural complex in Spain due for
completion this year. But to those outside Cooper Union, Hejduk
would be known for suites of drawings like the ``Lancaster/Hanover
Masque,'' completed in 1982. Symbolically charged, arranged in
narrative form, this project featured a cast of architectural
protagonists _ the Accused, the Balloonist, the Retired Judge _ in
a brooding, Expressionist townscape.
</P>
<P>
   Hejduk did not project his sensibility deeply into the material
world. Others have done this for him. In his design for the Jewish
Museum in Berlin, Daniel Libeskind, a former Hejduk student, has
created as powerful an architectural experience as can be seen in
that city today. Visitors are stunned by the building's climactic
space: a soaring, crepuscular chamber with walls and floor of stark
concrete, entered through a tall metal door that clangs shut.
Designed to convey the sense of helpless isolation experienced by
Holocaust victims, this Kafkaesque environment embodies Hejduk's
bleaker visions.
</P>
<P>
   Libeskind's project is not derivative. Nor is the Austrian
Cultural Institute, designed by Raimund Abraham, a professor at
Cooper Union. With its facade of sharply angled glass panels,
Abraham's slim tower (now nearing completion on East 52nd Street)
owes as much to the surrealist architect Frederick Kiesler as to
Hejduk. But Hejduk, like Kiesler, created a context that helps
clarify Abraham's aesthetic intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Diller, another student, and her partner, Ricardo
Scofidio, a Cooper professor, have taken other aspects of Hejduk's
work in sparkling new directions. The two share his preoccupation
with the metaphysics of form and materials: opening and enclosure,
transparency and opacity, differentiation and merger, distance and
duration. Diller and Scofidio analyze such characteristics in terms
of their social, psychological and even political values before
considering the functional and visual properties of walls, windows
and doors.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Hejduk inspired Diller and Scofidio to pursue
the concept of alternative practice. Though the two have several
buildings to their credit, and more are in the works, they have
presented their ideas primarily in museum installations,
performances, books and electronic media, as well as in their
careers as teachers. They have conveyed to a larger audience the
idea that architecture operates by changing consciousness as well
as by reorganizing the physical world.
</P>
<P>
   I like the mess and compromise that goes with conventional
practice. The smell of concrete dust, the look of scaffolds and
wiring hanging out of the walls, the vertigo of riding in a
construction elevator, the curiosity of sidewalk superintendents,
the wear and tear that goes with usage, the difference between
renderings and realities: all this is part of the art of
architecture as I see it. I am awed by the power of a building to
be simultaneously a metaphor and a pile of stuff. The stuff itself
has metaphoric value.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For these reasons, and others, I once went into attack mode over
Hejduk's withdrawal from practice. I don't regret a word of the
column, which appeared in Artforum in 1988. It is a critic's
business to throw light on the dark side of the moon, even if the
bright side is enchanting. And 1988 was a moment to face a
disconcerting truth: when talented people retreat from the
marketplace, the clunks rush in to take their places.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't there a point at which an architect's solitary pursuit
slips into self-indulgence?
</P>
<P>
   The clunks are still rushing in. Too many talented people are
still sitting by passively, waiting for their ships to come in. Too
many untalented people have come to equate passivity with genius.
Too many firms complain that Cooper graduates are unemployable.
I'll reserve my highest respect for architects who like to mess
around with stuff.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also true that the vitality of the city now rests on
``alternative practices.'' The city itself has become an
alternative way of life. Creativity is inherently alternative,
whether it turns up in a mainstream firm or a third-year studio.
John Hejduk won't let us forget that.

STILL A SLY WIT, NOW MOSTLY FOR HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 16) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CRUZ, Calif. _ His songs are the stuff of your fondest
adolescent imagination, subversive send-ups of the Boy Scouts,
religion, college cheerleading, pollution, plagiarism, prudishness.
They are twisted, erudite parodies of the perverse: a
necrophiliac's love song, a ``Masochism Tango,'' a nuclear military
march. Acid attacks on political expedience: ```Once the rockets
are up, who cares where they come down? That's not my department,'
says Wernher von Braun.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is a bit of a surprise on meeting Tom Lehrer, the
Harvard-trained mathematician-cum-musician whom the disc jockey
Barry Hansen has called ``the most brilliant song satirist ever
recorded,'' to learn that he seems a lot more like the gently
whimsical voice behind his children's songs for the television
series ``The Electric Company'' (about adverbs, spelling and
selfishness) than the sick-genius author of ``Poisoning Pigeons in
the Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Smiling, elfin, a bit stooped but slim and spry at 72, Lehrer is
nothing so much as sweet. Oh sure, he confesses to still composing
such questionable ditties as ``Bye-bye, Baby'' (about
``partial-birth'' abortion), though now strictly to appall himself.
He bemoans the decline of civility and grammar and the collapse of
the unifying liberal political consensus that made his songs of the
'50s and '60s seem daring and safely hilarious at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   But he pines not at all for the performing career that made him
a sensation in nightclubs and concert halls (his last major paid
appearance was 33 years ago). He mourns not the muse that mostly
seemed to desert him after Vietnam and assassinations and Watergate
made it harder to be funny about serious things. Or, as he once put
it: ``Political satire became obsolete when Henry Kissinger was
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.''
</P>
<P>
   Why should Lehrer be glum? He still spends the cold half of the
year in this beautiful college town at the edge of the Pacific,
teaching math for non-mathematicians (``math for heads,'' he called
it in the '70s) at the University of California at Santa Cruz,
where he has taught since 1972, after earlier stints at Harvard,
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Wellesley College. He
still spends the warm half in Cambridge, Mass., where he first went
to Harvard as a precocious 15-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   And Rhino Records has just issued a lavish, three-disc boxed set
of his career oeuvre (R2 79831), including a handful of previously
unreleased recordings like ``I Got It From Agnes'' (you guessed
what ``it'' is) and ``Hanukah in Santa Monica,'' a hymn to Jewish
holidays that rhymes ``Shavuos'' with ``East St. Louis.'' (He
decided against a line that rhymed a body part with Passover).
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazing,'' Lehrer says modestly of the enduring appeal of his
songs, which first saw the light in informal performances in
Cambridge, then on a 10-inch, self-released LP in 1953 and later in
the best-selling 1965 album ``That Was the Year That Was,'' and
have now been embraced by at least three generations of devoted
fans. ``When I made that first record, it was just to sell around
Harvard,'' he said. ``It never dawned on me that all these years
later, well, I wrote `Fight Fiercely, Harvard' in 1945 and the band
plays it at half-times now, 55 years later.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Lehrer may stick to the blackboard and not the
microphone these days, but his gift for verbal distillation has not
deserted him. ``When I was in college, there were certain words you
couldn't say in front of a girl,'' he writes in liner notes for the
new collection. ``Now you can say them, but you can't say `girl.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lehrer is not a recluse, though he resists all publicity unless
he has something to sell, refuses television interviews (because
he'd be asked to perform and then might be recognized in airports)
and acknowledges having encouraged rumors that he was dead, in the
vain hope of cutting down on his junk mail. Other rumors are
equally false, like the one attributing the end of his performing
career to a successful libel suit by von Braun, the German-born
rocket scientist whose ideological flexibility he mocked so
devilishly on ``TWTYTW.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Lehrer is a man who had his moment, enjoyed it, banked his
royalties and moved on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel the need for anonymous affection,'' Lehrer said.
``If they buy my records, I love that. But I don't think I need
people in the dark applauding. It's nice to be reassured once in a
while, but a real performer has to do it over and over again. I
can't understand the Yul Brynner phenomenon, `The King and I' night
after night.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Lehrer added: ``I'm not interested in promoting myself,
or revealing to total strangers anything about me. That's not my
job. I read some of these things with people who will tell you all
about their abortions, and their affairs and their divorces and
their nervous breakdowns and their parents, and why are they doing
that? And I'm sure if you asked them how much money they made last
year, they'd tell you it's none of your business.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Lehrer, a lifelong bachelor, grew up in New
York, where his father manufactured ties and his mother took him to
musical theater, igniting a passion that has never wavered. He went
to camp with a pretty fair songwriter named Stephen Sondheim, whom
he calls ``the greatest lyricist the English language ever
produced'' but whom he wasn't especially close to at the time.
``I'm two years older, and when you're 10, you don't hang out with
8-year-olds,'' Lehrer explained.
</P>
<P>
   Lehrer was also good at math, not uncommon for musicians. Asked
why, he replied: ``I could make something up. I think it has to do
with abstraction. I think music is the most abstract of the arts;
it's not representational. There's something mathematically
satisfying about music; notes fit together and harmony and all
that. And mathematics has to do with abstractions and making
connections.''
</P>
<P>
   Formalities like a Ph.D. and tenure eluded him, but Lehrer had a
gift for pastiche, borrowing and echoing musical styles and sources
from Gilbert and Sullivan to Danny Kaye. Indeed, ``Lobachevksy,''
his paean to plagiarism featuring the name of a real, dead,
nonplagiarist Russian mathematician, is itself one big inside joke:
``A direct plagiarism,'' Lehrer said, of a Danny Kaye routine about
Stanislavsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Lehrer canon, only about 50 recorded songs, falls into three
basic clumps: his first two albums from the '50s, with black-comic
parodies of various song styles and genres; the overtly political
satire of ``That Was The Year That Was'' (a collection of songs
contributed to the television program of the same name and recorded

SENATE CHAIRMAN OFFERS MEDICARE DRUG PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the battle over prescription drugs shifting to
the Senate, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee has broken
with House Republicans and will propose a government-administered
program to offer drug benefits to all Medicare recipients, senators
of both parties said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats and White House officials said that they were
surprised and pleased by the proposal from the panel's influential
chairman, William Roth, R-Del., and that they believed it would
increase the chances of adding drug benefits to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Roth will go over his proposal at a closed meeting of the
Finance Committee on Wednesday. The panel will have an opportunity
to amend and vote on it later this month.
</P>
<P>
   A bill passed last month by the House would give subsidies to
insurance companies to entice them into providing drug benefits to
people on Medicare _ an approach opposed by President Clinton and
by most Democrats in Congress, who say it is unlikely to work.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers said Roth clearly intended to depart from the House
bill, under which private insurers would administer drug benefits
and bear much of the financial risk.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, a Senate Republican aide said, under Roth's
proposal, ``the government would bear the insurance risk and take
responsibility for administering the benefit, as it does with the
rest of Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   The House bill was passed by a vote of 217-214, largely along
party lines. Democratic senators said Roth's proposal was much
better than the House bill because drug coverage would be
integrated into Medicare, the health insurance program for the
elderly and disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats said they could work with Roth, a conservative
Republican who is running for re-election in a tight race against
the governor of Delaware, Thomas R. Carper, a Democrat. Roth's
proposal for a government-administered drug program would almost
certainly have appeal to older Delaware voters.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republican leaders gave no immediate indication of how
they would respond to Roth's proposal. Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., neither embraced nor rejected it. John S.
Czwartacki, a spokesman for Lott, said Tuesday night that the
majority leader ``has no comment at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats see Medicare drug benefits as one of their most potent
political issues in this year's elections. Congress is far from
passing any bill acceptable to Clinton, and many lawmakers believe
a stalemate is the most likely outcome. But Senate Democrats said
Roth's efforts could help narrow the gap between the parties,
increasing the chances that drug benefits might be added to
Medicare this year.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White
House, said he did not know all the details of Roth's proposal.
But, he said, if Roth has rejected the idea of subsidizing
insurance companies to provide drug benefits, ``that would
represent a very important step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., said: ``I am very pleased at what I've
heard of Senator Roth's proposal. He accepts the fact that
prescription medication is a central part of a modern health care
system, not the red-headed third cousin at the family picnic that's
shuffled off to the side and treated in a demeaning manner.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Graham added: ``Senator Roth puts drug coverage
into the family of Medicare, rather than having it isolated in a
private insurance plan. We know in advance that private insurers
are very reluctant to offer free-standing drug coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard H. Bryan, D-Nev., sounded a similar note, saying:
``The chairman appears to have crossed the Rubicon and is embracing
a prescription drug proposal within Medicare. In my view, that is
very significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Roth's proposal, Medicare beneficiaries would have two
options if they wanted freedom in choosing their doctors. They
could stay in the original fee-for-service program, with the
existing benefits, premiums, deductibles and co-payments. Or they
could enroll in a high-option plan, which would provide drug
benefits but would also charge more for certain services, like
laboratory tests and home health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an explicit tradeoff,'' said a Republican who helped
draft the plan. ``The co-payments, the co-insurance, would save
money. The money could be reinvested to provide a richer package of
benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, when asked to describe their strategy for passing drug
legislation, White House officials said they pinned their hopes on
the Finance Committee, where members of the two parties have a
history of working together. Mr. Roth has solicited the views of
the 19 other committee members in hopes of sending a bill to the
Senate floor with bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   Roth's proposal incorporates many features of a bill devised by
moderate Democrats on the committee, including Graham and Sen.
Charles Robb of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   While Republican leaders have not weighed in on Roth's proposal,
their aides said the lawmakers were pleased that Roth was adhering
to the budget blueprint adopted by both houses of Congress in
April. That blueprint set aside up to $40 billion over five years
for Medicare drug benefits. Clinton and congressional Democrats say
they never accepted that limit and want to spend more on drug
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Public response to Roth's proposal will depend on the answers to
two questions: How much will beneficiaries have to pay for drug
coverage? And how much will they receive in benefits? Details of
the proposal were still being adjusted Wednesday night, to reflect
cost estimates from the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   Roth's desire to charge beneficiaries a fee for home health
services provoked a predictable outcry from the industry.
</P>
<P>
   James C. Pyles, a lawyer for the American Association for Home
Care, said: ``The idea of a co-payment on home health care is
monumentally stupid. It would hit the sickest, most vulnerable
patients, who tend to be the highest users of home care.'' Medicare
spending on home care dropped 45 percent in the last two years, to
$9.7 billion in 1999, from $17.5 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Roth's proposal, as described Tuesday by senators and their
aides, includes these elements:
</P>
<P>
   _ A new office would be established in the Department of Health
and Human Services to administer drug benefits and to negotiate
contracts with health maintenance organizations serving Medicare
beneficiaries. The office would be separate from the current
Medicare agency, the Health Care Financing Administration, but
would work closely with it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Medicare would pay a larger share of a person's drug bills as
those expenses increased. While the details are still being worked
out, the government might pay half of drug costs below a specified
level _ perhaps $3,500 or $4,000 a year _ and 80 percent of costs
beyond that. By contrast, under many Democratic proposals, the
government would pick up 100 percent of drug costs above some
level, like $4,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   _ The government would hire private companies to help manage
drug benefits for the elderly, to negotiate discounts from drug
manufacturers and to set up networks of drugstores in different
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the high-option Medicare plan, the government would
establish a single deductible for the two existing parts of
Medicare. The program now has separate deductibles, $100 a year for
doctors' services and $776 for inpatient hospital care. In
addition, there would be a separate deductible for drug insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton's plan and under the bill passed by the House, the
government would offer subsidies to employers to encourage them to
continue providing drug benefits to retirees. Roth is not proposing
such subsidies.

YAHOO REPORTS QUARTERLY RESULTS THAT SURPASS FORECASTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Yahoo announced better-than-expected quarterly
earnings and revenue Tuesday, quelling investor concerns that
consolidation and business failures among struggling dot-coms might
hurt its revenue base.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo reported net income of $65.5 million for the quarter ended
June 30, or 11 cents a share, compared with analysts' consensus
projections of 10 cents a share. Revenue was $270.1 million,
exceeding analysts' estimates of $240 million, and up from $128.6
million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last quarter, the company reported net income of $63.3 million
on revenue of $228 million.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors bet in recent weeks that Yahoo would not meet its
target, as analysts warned of weakening revenue growth in the face
of reduced advertising spending by some struggling Internet
companies. Yahoo's share price was $148 three weeks ago, but has
fallen steadily. It fell another $4.50 today, to closed at $105.50.
But it rebounded in after-hours trading, rising to $121.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts said they were mildly but pleasantly surprised
by the results, but disagreed on how much to read into the earnings
report. Some said the quarter suggested that Internet companies
like Yahoo that rely on advertising revenue could breathe more
easily. But others said the results spoke more directly to the
strength of Yahoo's business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a respectable and solid quarter given the weakness in
online advertising,'' said Jordan E. Rohan, an analyst with Wit
Soundview, a New York-based brokerage firm. ``Yahoo came through.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the results showed that advertisers were continuing to
support major online media companies, like Yahoo and America
Online, but that it was unfair to assume that smaller Internet
media companies would also enjoy continued support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a mistake to apply it more generally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Yahoo did not dispute that consolidation in the
Internet industry was having an impact on its business. The company
said 10 percent of its advertising was coming from ``financially
questionable'' companies _ not limited to Internet businesses _
though it declined to provide the dollar figure represented by
those contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Susan L. Decker, Yahoo's new chief financial officer, said the
company had taken an ``exhaustive'' look at the impact of
struggling companies on its advertising revenue in light of the
recent investor concern.
</P>
<P>
   Paul W. Noglows, an analyst with Chase H &AMP; Q, said the 10
percent figure was not surprising and was ``lower than some people
were guessing it might be.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich LeFurgy, chairman of the Internet Advertising Bureau, a
trade group representing Internet advertisers, said the 10 percent
figure was in line with industry figures.
</P>
<P>
   In general, he said, ``about 10 to 15 percent of these Internet
deals are at risk.'' But he said the bigger players, like Yahoo,
were not at particular risk in the event of a shakeout. ``The
leaders in the online ad world are going to fare better than the
second- or third-tier sites that don't get much of a share of
online ad dollars in the first place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Yahoo was also insulated because it had
diversified its revenue between advertising and e-commerce sources.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy A. Koogle, Yahoo's chairman and chief executive, said
consolidation in the dot-com industry might wind up helping Yahoo
because weaker Internet companies would fall by the wayside, and
Yahoo might recoup a larger share of the revenue from a stronger,
more reliable advertising base.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported that it had retained all of its top 50
advertisers and 98 of its top 100 advertisers since the end of the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts and journalists, the company
continued to hammer home its efforts to grow overseas, with what
analysts described as positive results. The company said that 15
percent of its revenues came from global markets, excluding Japan,
compared with 13 percent last quarter and 9 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the number of individuals using the service
rose to 156 million visitors in the second quarter, compared with
145 million in the first quarter. This was one potential area of
lower-than-expected performance, said Noglows of Chase H &AMP; Q, who
projected that the company would hit 160 million users.
</P>
<P>
   But Noglows said that ``what was really significant was the
revenue figure,'' and from that perspective, he described the
quarter as ``very strong over all.''
</P>
<P>
   The earnings might provide some relief to other Internet
companies, said Scott Reamer, an analyst with SG Cowen Securities.
Reamer said that Yahoo had been seen as a bellwether and that if it
had stumbled today, many smaller Internet companies might have
toppled in its wake.

SAVING THE WORLD, ONE SEXY TEEN-AGER AT A TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 16) 
 By JEFF MacGREGOR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems to me that having created the Internet, the wireless
electronic pocket organizer and Oreos that turn your milk bright
blue when you dunk 'em, humankind has reached its technological
apogee. In so doing, we've solved our most fundamental problems:
``How can I deliver, to someone far away, an annoying online sales
pitch for deeply discounted off-season Adirondack time shares?''
and ``I'm a wealthy day trader and an idiot _ what day is it?'' and
``Why is my cookie so tasty yet not at all artistically ambitious
or challenging to the eye?''
</P>
<P>
   This is, of course, the best of all possible times to be alive
in this, the best of all possible worlds. Given our many
perfections in the physical realm, then, our automotive
heated-leather seating surfaces and our battery-operated Furbys and
our trip to the moon, shouldn't we turn our collective genius
inward, and begin to map the complex strivings of the human spirit?
Should we not use our abundant leisure to embark upon great voyages
of self-discovery? Should we not, at last, realize the dream of a
thousand generations long gone and enter a new golden age of
behavioral, sociological and philosophical enlightenment? A
renaissance of the heart, a millennium of inner peace?
</P>
<P>
   Happily for our benighted species, that very process has begun.
The ethical, moral and teleological questions that for so long had
the likes of Aristotle and St. Anselm and Lord Lloyd-Webber tossing
fitfully in their sleep are finally being answered. The dark
turnings of human nature are being illuminated. Our primitive quest
for the grace that surpasseth understanding is well under way. And
thanks to the most useful and compassionate technology of them all,
television, we can watch this postmodern reformation of human
character played out five days a week. Several times each day, in
fact.
</P>
<P>
   And who, you ask, are we to thank for this inspiring stampede
toward a brighter future? Grateful citizens, relieved theologians
and giddy philosophers everywhere need really remember only one
name: Maury Povich. For it is on his daytime talk show that we as a
nation now seek to wrestle with nothing less than original sin
itself.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that our last 2,000 years of thoughtful argument
over mysterious issues of redemption and damnation were nothing but
a huge waste of time. We were barking up the wrong tree of
knowledge, apparently, because perdition and sin and low
self-esteem, Povich has recently discovered, along with smoking,
drinking and breaking curfew, can be averted by one simple thing.
By just yelling at our children, or, better still, by hiring burly
professionals to yell at our children, we can make the world a
sweeter place.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Maury'' show is, to quote a recent issue of Entertainment
Weekly, this season's ``biggest success story'' in syndicated
daytime television. The show's ratings are up some 19 percent since
last year, and it now occasionally outpoints the popular ``Rosie
O'Donnell Show'' in the same time slot here in New York. This
``daytime yakker'' has got the ``big mo,'' they say. How did
``Maury'' do it? How did the show go from eponymous also-ran to
daytime juggernaut, more highly rated than even ``The Jerry
Springer Show,'' and now running neck and neck with the neckwear
savant Regis Philbin and the soon-to-be-marginally-less-ubiquitous
Kathie Lee Gifford? What's all the shouting about?
</P>
<P>
   The shouting is about shouting, actually, because ``Maury'' has
bootstrapped itself into the American brainpan by making volume a
virtue and battling evil at the top of its lungs. During the May
sweeps period, in which ratings are translated into advertising
rates and, therefore, profits, wayward teen-agers and delinquent
children of all stripes were being remade as model citizens on
programs subtitled ``My Wild Teen Needs Boot Camp!'' and ``Stop
Staring at My Teen Daughter's Body!'' and ``My Teen Needs Sex To
Survive!'' Oh, do these kids get yelled at!
</P>
<P>
   The premise for each episode of these behavioral makeovers,
which ran in heavy rotation during sweeps, is easily explained, and
their architecture rarely varies. Maury, clad in the stylish
vestments of the media priesthood (black V-neck sweater over a
white T-shirt), solemnly intones an introduction to the day's
battle of Right (Maury) against Wrong (teen girls who dress too
provocatively!, teen girls who dress too provocatively and verbally
abuse their mothers!, teen girls who dress too provocatively and
verbally abuse their mothers while trying to choke them! Teen girls
who smoke, drink, do drugs and have sex! Have unprotected sex! Have
unprotected sex with multiple partners and dress too
provocatively!). A bare handful of shows will include a teen-age
boy. He will seem lonely and confused.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is as ritualized as a high Mass. A worried mother
is brought onto the set. She is introduced, usually by her first
name only and with no further identification. We don't know where
she's from or how she came to be here. (Fathers are entirely absent
on the vast majority of these programs.) She then describes to
Maury, who looks on with an expression of beatific sympathy, her
daughter's pattern of delinquency. Most of the girls, it seems,
dress far too provocatively for someone their age (which ranges on
the shows I've seen from 8 to about 15; apparently all the bad
18-and-ups are over on the Springer show) and are engaged in risky
pursuits like smoking and imbibing hard liquor and having _ did we
mention this yet? _ sex. The mother's tearful monologue is only
occasionally interrupted for a Maurian sidebar like, ``And how many
times has she been arrested?'' or ``And then she tried to choke
you?'' or ``And how old is the oldest guy you've seen hit on her?''
The mothers are never asked if they're any good at mothering, or
work instead at a Hell's Angels meth lab in the desert. It seems,
rather, that the troubled adolescent has simply been possessed by
an evil spirit.
</P>
<P>
   By now the studio audience is groaning in disgust and seems very
anxious to meet this hell-bound Lolita. Maury obliges and we cut to
a jittery, hand-held shot from backstage, where the invariably
halter-wearing or tube-topped youngster is either slouching,
pacing, standing confrontationally with arms akimbo or gyrating in
an overtly, dare we say, provocative manner. Irrespective of body
position, each delivers an articulate rebuttal to whatever Mom just
said, generally along the lines of ``I'm 14 and I'm a grown-up
woman and I can live any way I want to and men buy me things
because of my big bosoms and I smoke and I drink and I don't care
what that (bleep) says, 'cause she's a (bleep) and don't know
nothin' about me.''
</P>
<P>
   We cut back to Povich, who clucks his tongue and introduces the
debutante in question. She enters the main stage to the derisive
catcalls of the audience. Her response? ``You don't know (bleep)
about (bleep), so shut up!'' Maury, familiar, no doubt, with
Robert's Rules of Order, gavels the crowd into line with the
shouted phrase ``Wait a minute! Wait a minute!'' and his
prosecution of the case begins. This takes the form of repeating
everything the girl just said, while she nods and says ``uh-huh.''
Satisfied that we're all on the same page, sex-and-violence-wise,
Maury cuts sharply to the epistemological heart of the matter.
``Why?'' he yodels, his face a medieval woodcut of dour concern,
``Why would you do this?'' Snapping her gum and clearly
overmatched, the girl answers for all humanity when she says: ``I
don't know. It's fun, I guess.'' O, weakness! O, vanity! Thus is
the scene set for the impending exorcism.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the next few segments, paced by the
commercial breaks (of which ``Maury'' has many, most having
something to do with getting the disability settlement you so
richly deserve, or with the show's own solicitations for further
troubled, well-built teen-agers), Povich introduces several more
mothers and their fallen angels, each as beguiling and foulmouthed
as the first. All the girls seem to break Maury's mighty heart with
the news that they want to be exotic dancers when they grow up. The
stage is filled with pain, fret and woe; mothers at their wits' end
and incorrigible daughters in skimpy outfits, and Maury Povich
wrangling it all with only his near-rabbinical persistence and his
cue cards to help him.
</P>
<P>
   There are two main variations of what comes next. In the first,
less elaborate version, a couple of streetwise counselors are
called on to scare the Satan straight out of these children. On
some shows, the first counselor, usually quite a bombshell, seems
to be a former sex worker or a contrite stripper or a recovering
porn star who's there to tell the girls that the glamorous adult
entertainment industry isn't the daffy hayride it's made out to be.
Again, credentials and bona fides remain murky to viewers. Her
fellow counselor is usually a large, loud man with a superfluity of
biceps and a larynx the size and density of an anvil. This becomes
evident backstage during the ensuing videotape piece in which he
roars questions at the hard-bitten little ragamuffins like ``You
think you're bad? You think you're BAD?''
</P>
<P>
   To which the girls can only reply with modest silence. The
former burlesque queen, however, is more specific, if less
explosive; asking if they all want to die of a drug overdose or get
stabbed to death in an alley. Waiting to hear other options,
perhaps, no one answers. This means that it's time to put the
recalcitrant darlings into the van and drive them to Times Square.
Upon arrival, they gather in front of a neon sign advertising one
of the few remaining neighborhood sex shows _ to be yelled at some
more. ``Don't you want to have your dignity?'' bellows one
counselor. ``Do you want to get AIDS?'' shrieks the other. Next
thing you know (``Maury'' editors play fast and loose with
chronology in these pieces) everyone is standing in that alley next
to a very sinister Dumpster. ``Don't you know that you have to love
yourself?'' brays one. ``I love you!'' screams the other. Regret is
mumbled. Sniffles snuffled. Tears roll down pubescent cheeks and
order is restored to the universe. These girls won't go bad. At
least not until someone turns off those camera lights. Fade to
black.
</P>
<P>
   In version two, usually titled ``Teen Boot Camp,'' the scantily
clad miscreants are inventoried as before, but are then confronted
by men in camouflage fatigues and freshly blocked troopers' hats.
Now it's two large men yelling, ``You think you're bad? You think
you're BAD?'' (One assumes this to be an effective line of inquiry
for many certified psychotherapists.) The kiddies are then hauled
off to a boot camp, the location and identification of which are
also unclear in some cases; although I caught one show wherein it
was actually specified as a facility of the Colorado County
Juvenile Boot Camp, located in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arrival, the yelling begins in earnest and so do the
pushups. With various unidentified drill instructors hollering at
them, ``Don't you know you have to love yourself?'' the jumpsuited
teens are forced to realize the error of their mulish ways by
hauling buckets full of water, eating without utensils and cleaning
up after themselves. ``Sir, yes, sir!'' After a few days of basic
training (compressed into seconds on tape) sniffles are heard
again, tears course down reformed faces and tough love conquers
all.
</P>
<P>
   The bonus round on the boot camp shows, though, is the girls'
return from the Inferno. Having been walked through Hell by Master
Sgt. Virgil and his shock troops, they are meek as lambs. Hell,
apparently, has many toilets that need scrubbing with a toothbrush.
The girls reappear, sometimes wearing matching black berets and
antisexy khaki coveralls _ paramilitary angels, really _ and are
weepily reunited with their moms. Hugs abound and smiles widen and
each has a little gift for Uncle Maury, too.
</P>
<P>
   Maury is happier than anyone at how things turned out, and
speaks in a generous and gentle whisper to each of the girls.
``What was it like at night being alone in a cell?'' or ``Were you
scared?'' he'll ask, and then extract from each the assurance that
they'll never be bad or choke dear mother again. On one such show
each was promised a free college education if she could remain
revirginized. Souls saved, Maury presents his benediction. Turning
to the nearest mother he says, ``As adults we have to assess our
behavior, too.'' Chin quivering as if she's hooked to an outlet
offstage, Mom agrees. ``Absolutely,'' she chokes out. Roll credits.
</P>
<P>
   Original sin thwarted and the rites of absolution performed in
44 minutes, plus commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Maury's not the only one with a new take on ``Crime and
Punishment.'' The stalwart Sally Jessy Raphael sends more than her
fair share of malevolent teens to boot camp on her syndicated show,
too, especially if they trash her green room right on camera; but
her version lacks the dire brio Maury brings to the work. Maury has
about him the evangelical enthusiasm of a tent-show revivalist.
Sally seems to have lost her zest for it, and often as not when
reading her cue cards has the appearance of a zoo employee who's
inadvertently been darted by her own tranquilizer gun.
</P>
<P>
   That morning television now regularly flirts with this kind of
quasi-kiddie pornography and gets away with it should trouble
someone, somewhere. But daytime television doesn't seem to merit
much serious criticism these days, or cultural oversight; it has
become a fact of life that these shows escape examination or
community outcry. At least ``The Jerry Springer Show'' only
humiliates and abuses consenting adults. Perhaps that's why the
ratings are down.
</P>
<P>
   Even behind the fig leaf of moral reclamation, though, shows of
the teen boot camp genre trade on the misdirected and theatrical
sexualization of minors. Parents are confused by nothing more than
the sexual maturing of their own children, I suppose, so the
punitive aspect of these programs, the stamping out of early and
inappropriate fires, may explain their popularity among some
daytime viewers. What mother, after all, hasn't been appalled or
frightened by the behavior of her teen-age daughter at one time or
another? Comfort lies in seeing that behavior punished and things
set right.
</P>
<P>
   The creepy titillations that also underlie shows of this nature,
however, are a different story. Guests on every talk show
everywhere are coached by their segment producers to be lively,
animated and demonstrative. One can only wonder what these children
_ and they are children, no matter how they're built _ are being
told to do and say by the producers.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when one in five wired youngsters say they've been
sexually approached on the Internet, when every advertising medium
from television to billboards to radio to magazines packages and
repackages sex as a marketing tool, when the secret cash cows among
the dot-coms are pay pornography sites and an online search for
``schoolgirl sex'' or ``teen sex'' produces hundreds of thousands
of hits, can we really be shocked, surprised or self-righteous
about the fact that our children spit out lungfuls of the very
sexuality we immerse them in? And, having taught them these
responses, doesn't it seem unjust to punish them in the village
square just to satisfy our own bad appetite for revenge? Are we mad
at them or at Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, the sexually
aggressive soft-core prom queens of MTV? Or do we simply punish our
children publicly because we resent living in an entertainment
nation co-opted by the tastes and buying patterns of teen-agers?
</P>
<P>
   Like Maury says, ``As adults we have to assess our behavior,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely.

 &HT;    Emotional Irvin steps away from Cowboys
 &HT;    By Gary Estwick
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas - For Michael Irvin, pushing off cornerbacks
seemed easy compared to fighting back emotions Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With Texas Stadium as his backdrop and three Super Bowl banners
waving
</P>
<P>
   in the background, Irvin ended his 11-year association with the
Dallas
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys the way his family wanted him to - on his feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing the game is a blessing,'' said Irvin, a wide receiver
who holds
</P>
<P>
   almost every major Cowboys receiving record. ``But walking away
was a
</P>
<P>
   blessing. And I have to take that blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin was injured Oct. 10. Following a reception, his head
slammed
</P>
<P>
   into the hard turf of Philadelphia's Veterans Stadium,
temporarily
</P>
<P>
   paralyzing him.
</P>
<P>
   Tests revealed that he sustained a herniated disc, but they also
</P>
<P>
   detected that Irvin was born with a narrow spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said because of that genetic condition another blow to
his
</P>
<P>
   head or neck could be lethal.
</P>
<P>
   He stuttered when asked when the idea of retirement really hit
him.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin thought back to earlier this offseason when he was playing
with
</P>
<P>
   his kids. His wife started crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked 'Why are you crying?' `` said Irvin, who has a solid
chance of
</P>
<P>
   making the Pro Football Hall of Fame. ``She said, 'I just always
want to
</P>
<P>
   make sure you're able to play with the kids. '
</P>
<P>
   ``From a physical standpoint, I could probably still line up and
play
</P>
<P>
   football, but I knew that there would never be peace if I played
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, 34, who was a free agent, said he didn't plan on testing
the market
</P>
<P>
   for his services elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never wanted to give my heart to any other team than the
Dallas fans
</P>
<P>
   because that's what they gave me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Former teammate Daryl Johnston said more than anything the
Cowboys will miss Irvin's work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really pushed a lot of us as teammates to work as hard as
him
</P>
<P>
   because you wanted to reach the same goals that he did,''
Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You watched him work as hard as he did, as great of a player
as he was,
</P>
<P>
   and it just forced everyone else to work that hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas coach Dave Campo agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, you're looking at the most competitive receiver
to ever
</P>
<P>
   play the game,'' Campo said. ``Whatever Michael did, whether it
</P>
<P>
   was playing dominoes, whether it was basketball, on the practice
field,
</P>
<P>
   in games, he has that little something extra that it takes for
him to be
</P>
<P>
   the best at whatever he did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys prepped for life after Irvin in February,
</P>
<P>
   acquiring receiver Joey Galloway from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his years in Dallas, Irvin. along with Troy Aikman
and Emmitt
</P>
<P>
   Smith, was one of the ``triplets.'' He shared great and not so
great
</P>
<P>
   times.
</P>
<P>
   Those problems included a 1996 motel-room drug bust, which led
to an
</P>
<P>
   NFL suspension, 800 hours of community service and four years of
</P>
<P>
   probation, which was lifted Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Irvin was falsely accused of sexual assault in December
1996 and
</P>
<P>
   in 1998 training camp he cut the neck of a teammate during a
scuffle
</P>
<P>
   over a haircut.
</P>
<P>
   At his farewell announcement, current and former Cowboys were on
present to wish him farewell, including Larry Allen, Johnston and
Deion Sanders, now with the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin won't leave football completely. He will work with Fox
Sports
</P>
<P>
   Net next season.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Epic Proportions.'' ``The Civil War.'' ``The
Cripple of Inishmaan.'' ``Capeman.'' One would think a director
might want to hide out for a while and recuperate after such a
string of flops.
</P>
<P>
   But the director in question is Jerry Zaks, who not so very long
ago also produced a string of hits, including ``Six Degrees of
Separation,'' ``The House of Blue Leaves,'' ``Lend Me a Tenor'' and
``Guys and Dolls,'' each of which won him a Tony Award _ not to
mention his Tony nominations for ``A Funny Thing Happened on the
Way to the Forum,'' ``Anything Goes'' and ``Smokey Joe's Cafe.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been in the business long enough to know that the best
way to heal is to keep on working. So, sitting in the cool darkness
of the Roundabout Theater Company's newly refurbished American
Airlines Theater, where his Broadway production of ``The Man Who
Came to Dinner'' opens on July 27, Zaks did not deny that the last
few years have been trying ones. But he also seemed anything but
defeatist. ``I think you've got to look at the big picture,'' he
said. ``I believe my best work is ahead of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Some would argue that Zaks has not so much failed his more
recent projects as that they have failed him. New comedies, even
more than straight plays, are a dying breed on Broadway. In large
part because writers have defected to television and movies,
producers say good funny material is increasingly hard to come by.
With plays costing $1 million or more to mount, comedies have also
become risky business, unless they are pretested London imports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Producers are afraid,'' said Rocco Landesman, the president of
Jujamcyn Theaters. ``They see enough of them fail.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the few American comedies that have made it to
Broadway lately have died quick deaths, namely last season's
``Wrong Mountain'' by David Hirson and ``Taller Than a Dwarf'' by
Elaine May. In the 1998-99 season, of course, there was Rob
Bartlett's ``More to Love: A Big Fat Comedy.'' It wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel Azenberg, who produces Neil Simon's work on Broadway,
said that writing funny is harder than it used to be, that Jewish
humor and African-American humor are no longer novel and that the
comic writers of the 1930s and 1940s have not been replaced. ``I
don't know what's funny about society now,'' Azenberg said. ``A
good comedy is not jokes, it's organic situations.''
</P>
<P>
   While Zaks, 53, is reluctant to blame the material, it is clear
that the pool of potential projects is not as deep as it once was.
``I read fewer and fewer scripts that make me laugh out loud,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Zaks said, experience coupled with success breeds
a kind of hubris, the kind that makes a director feel as if he can
triumph, whatever the obstacles. ``Because you are confident in
your skills as a director, you think you can make anything work,''
he said. ``And learning that is not the case when the material
doesn't support it is a hard lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   Why venture into problematic material at all? Zaks said that if
he had known it was problematic, he wouldn't have done it in the
first place. ``That's like saying you shouldn't have fallen in love
with someone,'' he said. ``It's not rational. It's an emotional
response.''
</P>
<P>
   The director said he had had that emotional response to ``The
Man Who Came to Dinner,'' the 1939 comedy by George S. Kaufman and
Moss Hart, after directing a reading of it about three years ago
for the Roundabout, which then decided to mount a full-fledged
production in its new theater on 42nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   The show stars Nathan Lane _ who also did the reading _ as
Sheridan Whiteside, a curmudgeonly New York writer and critic based
on Alexander Woollcott, who fractures his hip on the front steps of
a well-to-do family's Ohio home and torments the occupants during
his recuperative stay. Monty Woolley originated the role on
Broadway, where the play ran for 21 months and was subsequently
made into a movie.
</P>
<P>
   The cast of the current production also includes Jean Smart,
Stephen DeRosa, Byron Jennings, Lewis J. Stadlen and Julie Halston,
all of whom inhabit the luxurious living room set designed by Tony
Walton that pays tribute to the Roundabout's elegant surroundings,
the renovated Selwyn Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Zaks said he had refused to do the show without Lane, whom he
had directed in ``Guys and Dolls,'' ``Laughter on the 23d Floor,''
``A Funny Thing'' and a reading of Stephen Sondheim's musical
``Assassins.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men both said they had enjoyed creating Whiteside.
``Nathan and I talk a lot about how much does the character need at
any given moment to dispatch the people he's irritated by,'' Zaks
said. ``Does he need a BB gun? Does he need a bazooka? And
modulating that is important, lest he come across as just mean.''
</P>
<P>
   It is this kind of thinking through of a play that seems to
animate and sustain Zaks, whom colleagues describe as hard to get
to know. He takes obvious pride and comfort in perfecting a
production's theatrical details: how speeding up the delivery of a
line can suddenly make it funny; how a nail file might prove to be
a comic piece of business; how closing a door at the wrong moment
can kill a laugh. For Zaks, it seems, the work itself is a refuge _
safe and solid ground, the place where he calls the shots and feels
secure in his own capacity to make things right with the world.
</P>
<P>
   This production is the sum of thousands of little moments that
we have investigated, played with and orchestrated,'' Zaks said.
``There is no way to describe the joy I feel in the back of the
house when the audience is having a great time. Aside from my kids,
it's my greatest pride.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE)  &QL; 
 &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   In talking about how he directs, Zaks keeps mentioning trust as
paramount _ how his collaboration with Lane is strong because the
actor has faith in him. ``I depend upon the kindness of
playwrights, I also depend on the brilliance of really good
actors,'' Zaks said. ``An actor like Nathan, who's got his craft
right at his fingertips, he trusts me to suggest and shape and
observe. You feel kind of unlimited potential when you have that
connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Zaks' guardedness and his emphasis on trust seem to resonate
with his background. Born in Germany, he is the son of Holocaust
survivors. His mother, Lily, was liberated at Auschwitz; his
father, Cy, a kosher butcher, escaped the Nazis by masquerading as
a Gentile.
</P>
<P>
   Zaks was brought up in Paterson, N.J., and planned on becoming a
doctor. But after taking a date to see a Dartmouth production of
``Wonderful Town'' in his sophomore year, he was hooked and dropped
his pre-med classes.
</P>
<P>
   A heavy young man, he went on a diet and regularly closed
himself in a studio to dance to musicals like ``Hello, Dolly!''
until he was exhausted. He lost 40 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   After earning an MFA at Smith College, Zaks started acting in
New York with the Ensemble Studio Theater. He supported himself
with commercials and jobs in children's theater _ playing young
versions of Thomas Edison, Abraham Lincoln and Benjamin Franklin.
His first directing project was ``The Soft Touch,'' by Neil
Cuthbert in the mid-1970s. ``I stood in the back and fell in love
with directing,'' Zaks said. ``All of a sudden, I was getting a
different satisfaction than I got as an actor, but of the same
magnitude. It felt so good.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, he directed ``The House of Blue Leaves,'' the first in
a series of well-received productions for Lincoln Center Theater,
including ``Six Degrees of Separation,'' ``The Front Page'' and
``Anything Goes.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``He was responsible for the liftoff of this theater from a
standstill,'' said Bernard Gersten, executive producer of Lincoln
Center Theater. ``So my regard for Jerry and his talents is
boundless.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, perhaps, these early hits made Zaks a tough act
even for him to follow. ``When you have a burst of success
initially, they're all waiting and praying for you to fail,'' Lane
said. ``It's hard to keep that up, and eventually something is not
going to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say things _ nasty, nasty things _ and no matter how
successful you've been or how confident people think you are, it
hurts. It's just the nature of show business. It has its ups and
downs. People love you for a little and then they turn on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some might question why Zaks turned his energies toward
``The Civil War,'' Frank Wildhorn's song cycle, or ``Epic
Proportions,'' Larry Coen and David Crane's comedy about making a
``Ten Commandments''-style movie in the 1930s _ both of which
closed on Broadway because of lack of business. Or, they might ask,
why did Zaks decide to come in as a ``production supervisor'' on
last season's Broadway revue ``Swing!'' _ which was directed and
choreographed by Lynne Taylor-Corbett _ as well as try to rescue
Paul Simon's ``Capeman'' in 1998, for which he was uncredited in
the show's program.
</P>
<P>
   Landesman said that if Zaks had consulted him before taking on
``Epic Proportions,'' he would have advised against it. ``I would
have asked, `Is this a good enough play to bring out the best of
what you can do?''' Landesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Others believe that Zaks' work on ``Swing!'' _ a revue like the
longrunning ``Smokey Joe's Cafe,'' which Zaks directed in 1995 _ as
a ``production supervisor'' is the equivalent of script-doctoring
in the movies and unworthy of Zaks' considerable skills.
</P>
<P>
   Zaks responds that ``Epic Proportions'' made him laugh and that
``The Civil War'' _ which was overseen by Gregory Boyd at the Alley
Theater in Houston before Zaks took it on _ offered an opportunity
to do a show about an important subject. ``Swing!,'' he said, was a
challenge in terms of creating a unified whole out of several
disparate musical pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Landesman, who about 10 years ago gave Zaks an annual salary and
an office in exchange for getting first crack at his projects, said
he would like to see Zaks originate more material _ even though
``Smokey Joe's Cafe,'' ``The Civil War'' and ``Swing!'' were all
Jujamcyn shows. But he said he still believed that Zaks was the
best Broadway had to offer. ``There are more hits still in him,''
Landesman said. ``I have total confidence in the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what lessons he drew from his recent directing
experiences, Zaks demurred. ``It's painful, it's personal and it's
private,'' he said. ``I try not to live there too long.''
</P>
<P>
   But he continued: ``The work itself is no less fulfilling.
Obviously, I would prefer that something have a healthy and long
run. If it doesn't, it's because not enough people wanted to see
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has been bitter about reviews and sometimes
surprised by them, Zaks said he did not hold critics responsible
for a show's ultimate demise. While his production of Larry Shue's
farce ``The Foreigner'' Off Broadway in the mid-1980s, for example,
was largely dismissed, it ran for about three years on the strength
of word of mouth.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``A negative review never helps, but I don't think it's the
difference between something running and not running,'' Zaks said.
``I take pride in it all. I always hope that it's good enough that
someone will leave the theater and tell someone, `You have to see
this.'''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Zaks speaks of ``The Man Who Came to Dinner''
as if it belongs in another category, as if he is grateful for a
return to quality. ``I'd forgotten how good it feels to be
presiding over material as special as I think this is,'' he said.
``Sitting through this is something I look forward to and it's been
a while since I felt that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lane said the project clearly agrees with his friend. ``I've
never seen Jerry this happy, never seen him this relaxed,'' he
said. ``Hopefully, it's a tribute to the work we've been doing and
his own maturity. I've never seen him quite like this before.''
</P>
<P>
   Zaks said he had been going through a tough time in his private
life because his wife had been ill and that ``personal life has an
impact on the work.'' They have two daughters _ 12 and 18. Zaks met
his wife, Jill Rose, a former dancer, while doing a national tour
of ``Grease'' during Zaks' acting days _ he played Kenickie, she
played Frenchie.
</P>
<P>
   But while Zaks worries about what he could have done to make
certain shows better, he does not seem to obsess about whether
various misfires might damage his reputation in the long run. ``The
people who put on shows know what I do,'' he said. ``And they
haven't seemed any more reluctant to have me do what I do because a
couple of shows haven't worked at the box office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Professionally and personally, things couldn't be better,'' he
said. ``It's showtime.''

TENNESSEE REPORT CITES REGULATORY LAPSES IN FRANKEL FRAUD CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Martin R. Frankel, who prosecutors contend
masterminded an elaborate insurance fraud from his estate in
Greenwich, Conn., might have been shut down as early as a decade
ago if Tennessee regulators had done their jobs properly, Tennessee
investigators said in a report.
</P>
<P>
   The state's comptroller of the treasury found that there was a
``gross breakdown'' in regulation of Franklin American Life
Insurance, the company that was Frankel's main insurance entity. It
took years to discover what the comptroller's office suggested were
flagrant violations of local insurance rules.
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller's report, released this week, found that the
state insurance department did not have the money and expertise
needed to oversee Franklin American. The department also had ``an
apparent desire to assist the company,'' which had been troubled.
Department officials were not accused of malfeasance.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel fled the United States in May 1999 under pressure from
Tennessee and Mississippi regulators. He was captured four months
later in Germany, where he is being held and is fighting
extradition.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have accused Frankel of diverting insurance premiums
of companies he controlled to a Swiss bank account and spending
some of that money on expensive luxuries, including a four-acre
Greenwich home, leased corporate jets, a fleet of cars and a
sizable household staff. Frankel, who used numerous aliases, also
hired prominent lawyers and forged an alliance with a senior
official at the Vatican in an apparent effort to expand his
holdings and shield them from scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance industry experts said that Frankel's suspected fraud
showed how vulnerable the industry is to even moderately
sophisticated schemes. Insurance companies are regulated by the
states, not the federal government, and the quality of oversight
varies widely, they said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the comptroller's report, Tennessee regulators made
their first mistake in 1991 when they failed to scrutinize the
named trustees and beneficiaries of a trust Frankel set up to buy
Franklin American despite numerous ``oddities'' in the trust's
filings.
</P>
<P>
   A series of mistakes followed. Regulators allowed Franklin
American to turn over its reserves to an unknown, out-of-state
securities firm despite state rules that required insurance
companies to house their reserves in a local bank.
</P>
<P>
   Though department regulators suspected that Franklin American's
money was being invested riskily, they were slow to investigate.
When they did look into the company's investments, they were
apparently baffled by fraudulent trading records that showed
unusually high returns from an unorthodox investment strategy, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   When Tennessee hired an outside examiner to look into Franklin
American's trading in late 1998, the examiner discovered numerous
problems and warned department officials in a memorandum. ``There
is a possibility that the company has been looted of its assets,''
the report quotes the memorandum as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, however, Tennessee officials, after hearing appeals
from two prominent Tennessee lawyers hired by Franklin American,
gave the company a 60-day grace period to comply with state laws,
the report said. The fraud finally unraveled in late April and
early May 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee insurance regulators were able to recover some of the
money belonging to Franklin American's insurance customers before
Frankel fled.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Sizemore, who became Tennessee's insurance commissioner
in 1995, resigned in October 1999. He said his resignation was not
prompted by the Frankel case.
</P>
<P>
   The case has resonated among insurance industry officials
nationally. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners,
which accredits state regulatory agencies, suspended Tennessee last
February. The association has since issued guidelines recommending
that members get expert help when examining high-risk investment
strategies of insurance companies.

   Christopher Gibbs begins his brief new book on Schubert (``The
Life of Schubert,'' Cambridge University Press) by avoiding any
claim to the ``true'' man and composer. He will, in his words,
``recount what can be reliably documented and ... examine some of
the most persistent legends.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is a little more from the same paragraph: ``constructing a
narrative of Schubert's life ... necessarily reflects
contemporaneous interpretations, concerns and methods, and
constitutes Schubert's subjectivity according to contemporaneous
theories, paradigms and cultural context.''
</P>
<P>
   The academese is tortured, but the words are wise. Let's put
aside ``paradigm'' and ``context'' and be simpler. First, facts are
only part of the truth. Knowing the chronologies and the anecdotes
from friends is a help, but they do not tell us who Schubert was.
Indeed, the truth of Schubert is that he knows more about us than
we about him.
</P>
<P>
   Some creative people are this big. Each generation re-examines
Beethoven and Shakespeare, and finds itself looking in a mirror.
The fact of Beethoven is the small, ugly blue-chinned man staring
out of the Viennese portraiture of 1803 and 1804. In Max Klinger's
``Beethoven Monument,'' carved a century later, the composer has
taken on the physique of a running back, outfitted in a weirdly
luxurious array of marble. Forensic investigators measuring the
bones buried in the great man's grave would be hard put to match
them up with Klinger's Olympian figure, bent forward with fists
clenched.
</P>
<P>
   The song goes, ``You made me what I am today; I hope you're
satisfied.'' And so we listened to the music for 100 years and
needed to make the man bigger. The most rewarding conceit in Gibbs'
book is that Schubert's body died in 1828 but that his musical
career kept growing. The same can be said for Beethoven, although
Schubert's case is more vivid.
</P>
<P>
   With Beethoven, there were fewer things to discover. Schubert
masterpieces kept emerging from attic trunks 40 and 50 years after
the composer's death. Great piles of his songs and instrumental
pieces were around but either forgotten or ignored. The
``Unfinished'' Symphony had its first performance at least 40 years
after it was written; similarly, the ``Great C major'' Symphony.
Well into the 20th century, only Artur Schnabel and a few others
played the piano sonatas. Rachmaninoff in the mid-'20s did not know
they existed.
</P>
<P>
   Already a decade after Schubert's death, the trickle of his
music made one French writer wonder if forgers were at work: ``All
Paris has been in a state of amazement at the posthumous diligence
of the songwriter Franz Schubert, who, while one would think his
ashes repose in peace in Vienna, is still making eternal new songs
and putting drawing rooms in commotion.'' Later, the critic Eduard
Hanslick accused Schubert's corpse of ``composing invisibly.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a career in the form of a time-release capsule. Each new
granule that enters our system has an added effect on it. And as we
listen anew, we reformulate Schubert the man. In the operetta
``Blossom Time,'' Schubert played the sappy dreamer; the imaginary
smell of lilies coming off the stage was overpowering.
</P>
<P>
   A docudrama shown at Lincoln Center a few years ago was a
stunning evocation of place. One could almost smell the horses, the
streets and, indeed, Schubert himself. The film itself was a homage
not so much to the composer as to the sadomasochistic tendencies of
the Central European spirit, being divided rather simple-mindedly
into innocent victim (Schubert) and oppressors (his circle of
friends). One scene went roughly like this. Friends: ``Schubert,
you must compose operas.'' Schubert: ``But gee, fellas, all I want
to do is write the C major Quintet.'' Friends: ``No, Schubert, you
must compose operas.'' Schubert: ``Oh, all right.''
</P>
<P>
   For modern musicologists, battered by sexual revolutions and
psychotherapy, Schubert is a drunk and probably gay. The Romantic
era concluded from the anecdotes of friends that he was neglected
and poverty-stricken (although Gibbs points out that he wasn't
really either).
</P>
<P>
   Beethoven and Schubert represented two forms of the Romantic
dream. Beethoven became the fierce giant on the mountaintop,
shaking his fist at Valhalla. As the heroism of his music got
bigger, it was necessary to make bodily adjustments as well.
Schubert could be wept over deliciously. He was the tragic loser:
unappreciated and snatched from life at 31. We liked him small,
roly-poly, vulnerable and not at all vast or otherworldly.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the title ``Unfinished,'' as Gibbs points out, became a
Schubertian metaphor for a life we wanted to imagine. We like to
sigh that death robbed us of the famous symphony's last two
movements, when in fact Schubert most certainly wrote what we know
years earlier and then put it aside for a later day. It also spoils
our fun to consider the possibility that Schubert simply lived
faster than the rest of us, with knowledge of bad health
accelerating the creative footrace of that astonishing last year.
</P>
<P>
   Next to Beethoven's machismo, Schubert shows his feminine side
only if we accept politically incorrect characteristics of
womanhood: namely, passivity, a yielding nature and victimization.
Recent attempts at parsing the harmony and phrasing for womanly
traits have resulted in unintended humor.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Gibbs is right. We can put on Schubert's clothes,
taste his food and drink, and still not understand his world.
Constructing the fact of his daily life produces a kind of Colonial
Williamsburg, a place that has more to do with tourists than with
the House of Burgesses. Schubert will always be what we want him to
be. Again, he's that big.

CARTER AND BRUINS NO CLOSER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ During the weekend of the NHL draft, with the league's
brain trust gathered in Calgary, Alberta, Bruins forward Anson
Carter thought his phone was going to ring with the news that
Boston had traded him.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who became a restricted free agent July 1, heard that he
was a likely candidate to change teams. The rumor that the Bruins
were shopping him persisted in the days before the draft and
continues. It has followed the 26-year-old Carter all the way to
Los Angeles, where he is rehabilitating from shoulder and wrist
surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm holding out that there's a possibility I will be back,''
said Carter. ``But my gut feeling is that I won't be back, to tell
you the truth. I definitely have the feeling that the word is out
there. I'm not surprised about that at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could come from the organization _ I'm almost positive
that's where it's coming from. I think they might (perceive) I view
myself as `X' and they view me as `Y' and therefore, instead of
having to deal with this problem, `Why not move him and see what we
can get for him?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a professional and if that's the case I'm going to do my
thing regardless of where I am. At the same time, if I'm going to
be back with the Bruins, I want to be signed by training camp
because it is a big year.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Carter and Bruins management have
haggled over a contract. They went through a difficult time in the
summer of 1998 when he was up for renewal. Carter missed all of
training camp and the first month of the season before coming to
terms on a two-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   Carter believes he is worth more than the Bruins are willing to
pay him. He had hoped to avoid turmoil with an extension similar to
the one the Bruins and center Jason Allison ironed out before
Allison's surgeries. But it wasn't to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right from the initial talks, the feeling I got is that they
view me as a certain kind of player and I view myself as being
another kind of player in terms of salary structure,'' said Carter.
``We're not even close right now. You'd like to say we're close,
and there's a chance, but we're not. It is early, but based on my
past dealings with the organization, this could take a while. If
not, I'll probably end up being traded.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter said he's not surprised at the impasse. The shock is that
he's not already elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I thought I was getting traded at the draft,''
he said. ``I told my friend (goalie) Kevin Weekes that I thought
for sure I was getting traded. It turned out he got traded instead
of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter thought it might be easier this time because he has the
right to file for arbitration, something he didn't have two summers
ago. But he doesn't believe the Bruins view him any differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't even seem like it's a big deal now,'' he said.
``Now I have it and you're still hearing the same thing. I'm not
really worried about it. My priority is rehabbing my wrist and my
shoulder. I'm six weeks ahead of schedule so I'm pretty pumped
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   If the sides, down the road, don't get any closer, Carter said
he'd be quicker to ask for a trade than wait it out and try to find
another option such as playing in the IHL, as he did in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would use the beginning of camp as an ideal date,'' he said.
``I think the ball's in their court because I can't negotiate with
myself. We haven't heard from them in about two months. It's up to
them to decide what they want to do, if they want me on their squad
or not and at what cost. If that's not the case, maybe they should
move me.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter said he's not worried about what may happen, but he has
thought long and hard about the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see them trading Joe (Thornton) and (Sergei
Samsonov),'' he said. ``They've invested so much money into their
first-round picks. If things don't work out with one of the three
of us, I might be the logical guy to deal. I've played all those
scenarios a million times through my head already.''
</P>
<P>
   If he does get traded, he won't have many loose ends to tie up.
He decided to rent in the Boston area rather than buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked into buying but then I decided to rent a place,'' he
said. ``I thought about it because I didn't get the feeling that I
was one of those guys they wanted to build around. That was my gut
feeling. Just because of what we went through, the whole contract
negotiation, and how far apart we were, and how they view me as a
hockey player. I got the feeling I wasn't going to be here very
long.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruins president/general manager Harry Sinden acknowledged that
progress has been slow, as it has been around the league with all
restricted free agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't having any communications right now,'' said Sinden.
``He's been out a long time with his injuries. His got started much
earlier than anyone else's but it hasn't gone anywhere. All
indications are that it is (going to be very difficult), yes.''

ROCK MUSICIANS WARN SENATORS OF INTERNET PIRACY PERIL 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Celebrity and politics collided Tuesday on Capitol
Hill, as a rock musician joined online music executives and members
of the Senate Judiciary Committee to discuss the effects on the
recording industry of downloading music from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Lars Ulrich, the drummer for the heavy-metal band Metallica,
found what may have been an unexpected ally in Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, and chairman of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fair and reasonable licensing needs to take place; that is
what I'm hearing,'' Hatch said at the conclusion of a three-hour
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting room was packed with young spectators, spilling into
the hallway of the Hart Senate Building. Hundreds lined up to get a
view of Ulrich, or perhaps to gain some insight into the clash
between the recording industry and online music outlets.
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Association of America, which represents
major record labels, and several music groups have argued that
software created by the online music start-up Napster permits
individuals to steal copyrighted material. Officials for the
service, and their fans, contend that it simply allows for easy
sharing and sampling of music.
</P>
<P>
   To use the Napster service, which is free, users download
software over the Internet that allows them to store and catalog
their music on their own computers. Napster posts those catalogs,
and then enables users of the service to visit one another's
computers over the Internet and share and download one another's
music.
</P>
<P>
   Ulrich said that ``if music is free for downloading, the music
industry is not viable.'' Napster, he said, had ``hijacked'' his
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a carpenter who crafts a table gets to decide whether to
keep it, sell it or give it away, shouldn't we have the same
options?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Metallica and the rapper Dr. Dre sued Napster for
copyright infringement. A federal judge in Manhattan ruled this
spring that another online music database, MP3.com, had violated
copyright laws; the company has since settled with two labels.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress has been reluctant to interfere in the private
marketplace. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the ranking minority member
of the committee, said the intellectual property generated in the
United States was ``the envy of the world.'' Leahy, who kept an
open laptop computer in front of him throughout the hearing, noted
that millions of young voters are paying close attention to the
debate on intellectual property and the need for certain
safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   ``History has shown that when new technologies emerge, they may
initially seem to threaten to trump intellectual property
protection,'' Leahy said. ``In the end, things get sorted out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Leahy said that it is important both to ``protect the
legitimate right'' of artists and to reward them for their work.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Barry, the chief executive of Napster, based in San Mateo,
Calif., said the company's Web site had attracted nearly 20 million
users. And he said that Napster was helping, not hurting the
recording industry. People are buying more records, he said,
because they are able to sample and preview music before buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies that hold copyrights on behalf of creators, and
which control distribution of creative works, have a strong
inclination to change copyright law from a balanced vehicle for
public enrichment to an unbalanced engine of control,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barry said copyright holders were often reluctant to allow new
technologies to emerge. But, he said, innovations like radio,
television, the cassette player and the videocassette recorder have
``proved to be a financial boon to these same concerned copyright
holders.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than legislation from Congress, Barry called for a
``market-based solution that will benefit consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Others who testified Tuesday agreed. Fred Ehrlich, president of
new technology for Sony Music Entertainment, a unit of Sony Corp.,
said the ``private market will set itself right.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Hoffman Jr., president of Emusic.com, which charges and
pays royalties to artists for recordings on the Internet, said that
the government should strive to be more effective in enforcing
current copyright laws.
</P>
<P>
   And Roger McGuinn, of the folk-rock group the Byrds, said the
issue was ``a lot of worrying about nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ulrich, however, remained steadfast on legislative intervention.
``I think we're dreaming if you think we can work this out
ourselves,'' he said. ``The differences are too deep on too many
levels.''
</P>
<P>
   As the debate entered the Senate, a group called Artists Against
Piracy ran full-page advertisements Tuesday in several major
newspapers. The coalition supports the stance taken by Ulrich and
members of Metallica in favor of protecting intellectual property
rights. Corporate donors to the group include the National
Association of Recording Merchandisers, the Recording Industry
Association of America and Walt Disney Co.

 THURMONT, Md.: been talking.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many think that each side's intractable claims on the holy city
make the issue irresolvable, although Israeli television reported
that Barak was prepared to compromise on all issues, including
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that Barak has indicated in his
public statements and, again, in his private statements, that he
must return to Israel with some kind of a deal if he hopes to hold
his government together.
</P>
<P>
   However, Clinton, who was to spend the night at Camp David with
the two leaders, is unlikely to offer specific proposals for a few
days, hoping instead to spend the first sessions airing out the
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they expect the ``crunch days''
for negotiators to be next Monday and Tuesday, ahead of Clinton's
scheduled departure next Wednesday for Okinawa and a meeting with
leaders of the industrial nations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before arriving in the United States early on Tuesday morning, a
senior Israeli official told Israeli reporters aboard Barak's plane
that the prime minister was unruffled by the defection of three
rightist parties from his coalition and a no-confidence motion in
parliament that barely failed. The official, trying to put a
positive spin on events, said that Barak considered it an
accomplishment that the parties had stayed in his government for a
year.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that Barak believed that his position at the summit
would be strengthened by the fact that he had not spent the last
year at the helm of a narrow, dovish government.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials worried quietly that Americans and
Israelis would pressure them into making unwanted concessions
because of Barak's political problems, referring to frequent
mentions of the idea that Barak represented the best peace partner
they could hope for.

HOW THEY STUFFED A COMMUNIST BIKINI 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 16) 
 By J. HOBERMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The phrase ``Communist musical comedy'' may sound like an
oxymoron, but even the officially achieved utopia of
no-longer-extant East Germany required a few measures of utopian
song-and-dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hot Summer,'' the teen-age musical that was the DDR's
second-highest-grossing film in 1968, is not quite socialism
a-go-go but it's an entertaining artifact nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Like most movies produced in East Germany, ``Hot Summer''
(Icestorm International, 91 minutes, German with English subtitles)
is virtually unknown here _ although the strident, vaguely martial
title song, staged amid the scrubbed streets of downtown
Karl-Marx-Stadt, was excerpted in ``East Side Story,'' the sardonic
1997 documentary about Communist musicals by the independent
filmmakers Dana Ranga and Andrew Horn.
</P>
<P>
   Directed in wide-screen and pastel colors by the former
cameraman Joachim Hasler, ``Hot Summer'' is a collectivist romantic
fling. A group of 10 hitchhiking high school girls compete with a
comparable band of high school boys to see who can arrive first at
their vacation spot on the Baltic coast. The contest continues,
amid much cavorting on the beach, after they arrive: The boys play
a series of pranks (releasing mice in the girls' dorm); the girls
respond with taunting songs (``They think they're such big guys but
really they're babies in disguise'').
</P>
<P>
   Produced as part of a new emphasis on genre entertainments that
followed a ban of 11 mildly critical films, ``Hot Summer'' was not
the first East German musical, but it was the first youth musical.
Two of the stars, Frank Schoebel and Chris Doerk, were a popular
singing duo. Although labeled the ``East German `Grease''' by its
American distributors, ``Hot Summer'' is closer at heart to the
teen-age drive-in fare produced by American International Pictures.
(The oompah beat and regimented choruses also recall ``The Sound of
Music'' _ albeit with discreetly honking saxophones and twanging
guitars.)
</P>
<P>
   Made at the height of the international youth movement _ the
year AIP switched from ``How to Stuff a Wild Bikini'' to the
incendiary ``Wild in the Streets'' and Jean-Luc Godard unleashed
the cannibal hippies of ``Weekend'' _ ``Hot Summer'' is
relentlessly cheerful and upbeat. Authority is embodied by an
understanding cop and there is barely a hint of rebellion _ some
mild complaining about parents notwithstanding. The youths are
further characterized by a concern for culture. Two teen-agers
presage a night in the hayloft with prolonged quoting of classic
verse; another girl lectures her colleagues on Brecht's alienation
effect. The main dramatic tension pits the individual against the
group. Everybody does everything together, including shouting in
unison. The crucial question: ``Are we a collective or an ordinary
gang?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hot Summer'' is part of the ongoing series of East German
films newly released by Icestorm International in association with
the University of Massachusetts. The video transfer is
well-produced in a letterbox format with new, thoroughly adequate
English subtitles. In the post-Communist Germany, ``Hot Summer''
has become a cult film in somewhat the same spirit that East
Germany's quaintly functional package designs have become
collectibles and the Communist ``kinderhymnes'' of the defunct Free
German Youth organization have been reissued on CD.

ADVERTISING: DIRECT MARKETING AND INTERNET RETAILERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD STAMLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask anyone in the direct response industry to describe
e-commerce, and you're bound to get the same response: Internet
retailing is simply another kind of direct marketing, not
fundamentally different from the catalog and club businesses that
have long made their money selling directly to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But, at least until recently, many online sellers did not agree.
When making advertising decisions, they viewed theirs as a business
apart, a totally new endeavor with new rules or, more accurately,
no rules. And with little direct marketing experience of their own,
few paid attention to the lessons of an industry that long ago
learned to choose its media carefully and to control the costs of
acquiring customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call it naivete or Silicon Valley arrogance,'' said Jim Nail,
an analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., who
specializes in online marketing and advertising. Either way, the
result was the same: online retailers spent lavishly on general
advertising, often paying full price for print and broadcast ads
while eschewing cheaper and often more effective direct response
advertising. Their focus was on ``branding,'' and on the hope that
getting themselves known would be enough to garner customers and
win the good will of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   But branding is not sufficient by itself to generate sales, Nail
said: ``All it does is implant an idea in the consumer's head.'' To
get actual customers, he said, ``you have to target your
advertising to high-quality prospects, measure the value of your
customers and constantly use your data to fine-tune your
strategy.'' In short, ``you need direct marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is hardly surprising that this is the view of H.
Robert Wientzen, president of the Direct Marketing Association. He
is not surprised that branding alone has yielded e-tailers too few
customers at too high a cost. Indeed, he and other direct marketing
industry members used to scratch their heads, he said, and wonder
just how long such a mistaken strategy could last.
</P>
<P>
   Not very long, as it happens. The Internet bubble has burst.
Wall Street is less interested in branding than in bottom-line
profitability, the kind that few online retailers can demonstrate.
Many Internet sellers are watching their colleagues and competitors
go belly-up, and are realizing that they, too, may soon be in
trouble. And they are turning to direct marketers _ and direct
response agencies _ for help, said Robert Johnston, president of
the New York eCommerce Association, an industry trade group whose
members include software companies, Internet service providers and
a number of Internet retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For e-tailers,'' he said, ``the trend of the future is direct
marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I think that what the Internet has done is that it
has validated direct marketing,'' said Wendy Riches, president of
D'Arcy Marketing Communications Group, a division of B Com3 Group.
Her agency is among those that have recently seen a number of new
e-tailer clients. So has MediaCom Digital, a division of Grey
Global Group, according to its president, Harvey Goldhersz. And the
trend is not limited to large shops; smaller boutique agencies like
Iris Shokoff Associates, a direct media buyer, are also benefiting.
</P>
<P>
   What do they offer their new clients? ``Accountability,''
Goldhersz said. Shokoff agreed. ``Dot-coms need to find out just
who is buying from them so they can target those people again,''
she said. ``And they need to figure a way to get to new people,
cheaply and efficiently, by using media wisely and by negotiating
rates.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, many Internet retailers did none of this. Indeed,
if they measured at all, they limited their observations to what
they could see online, generally doing little more than counting
impressions _ that is, the number of people who saw their banners _
and clicks on a given site.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly a coherent strategy, Riches scoffed. ``Clicks alone mean
nothing,'' she said. ``It's not enough to bring a client to a Web
site, you've got to get them to buy.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How badly were the e-retailers doing? Well, Shokoff said that
she heard tales of Internet retailers spending as much as $5 to $50
to acquire each sale, even though direct marketers generally
consider $10 or less a customer to be appropriate under most
circumstances, according to Wientzen of the Direct Marketing
Association. He said that he had heard of worse numbers, too, of
Internet companies paying customer acquisition costs anywhere from
$80 to $400 a customer. They would even brag of customer bases of
perhaps 100,000, he added, a figure traditional direct marketers _
many of whom count their customers in the millions _ would
generally consider to be unprofitably low.
</P>
<P>
   Shokoff, Riches and Goldhersz all said that they could do
better. They have techniques of measurement, or metrics, media
buying resources and research capabilities that the Internet
sellers do not, they said, not to mention years of experience in
the field. But none would name specific Internet clients or give
specific examples of how they were helping them, for fear of
offending those that might be embarrassed by their prior missteps.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Goldhersz did allow that his clients included
companies like the Vitamin Shoppe and GoAmerica, a wireless
Internet service provider. And he said that one of his clients _
not necessarily one of the two _ had suffered rather acutely from
its ignorance of direct marketing before turning to his agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``They spent $14 or $15 million in the last quarter of last
year, all of it on branding,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And nothing happened.''

ARAFAT, BARAK FACE `WRENCHING QUESTIONS,' CLINTON SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ President Clinton launched Camp David's second
Mideast peace summit Tuesday, saying Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat ``face profound and
wrenching questions'' that will require compromises from both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on the White House lawn before departing for the
presidential retreat, Clinton said the road to peace ``is a two-way
street'' and that ``both sides must find a way to resolve competing
claims.''
</P>
<P>
   In bringing together the two leaders in the rustic setting of
Camp David in the Catoctin Mountains, about 75 miles north of
Washington, Clinton is hoping that geography will once again play a
part in presidential and Mideast history. The retreat was the site
where then Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat struck a peace deal in 1978, under then
President Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said resolving the 52-year-old Israeli-Palestinian
conflict was the key to achieving a lasting peace in the Middle
East. ``Of course there is no guarantee of success, but not to try
is to guarantee failure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The high stakes summit is taking place against the backdrop of a
series of deadlines. Clinton, who has only five months remaining on
his presidency and would like his legacy to include bringing peace
to the Middle East, rearranged his schedule this week to clear all
but part of Thursday for the peace talks. He was staying at Camp
David.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do everything I can over the coming days to see that this
moment of promise is fulfilled,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The clock is also ticking toward the Sept. 13 deadline that
Arafat has publicly set for unilaterally declaring statehood, and
analysts say time is no friend either to Barak, whose political
base is steadily eroding and whose arrival here was delayed by a
government crisis and a parliamentary vote of no confidence that he
narrowly survived.
</P>
<P>
   Though all three leaders are in a race against time, the issues
may not be easily resolved, having defied solution in the seven
years since Israel agreed to begin turning over territory to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   They range from East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians seek as
their capital but which Barak insists will never be relinquished,
to the claims of Arab refugees to homes in Israel from which they
fled or were ousted after Israel's founding a half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two leaders face profound and wrenching questions, and
there can be no success without principled compromise,'' Clinton
said before departing the White House for the talks.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving at Camp David Tuesday, Clinton went immediately
into a meeting with his US negotiating team. Afterwards, he took
turns meeting with Arafat and Barak on the back porch of the Aspen
presidential cabin _ about 30 minutes with Arafat and 50 minutes
with Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the three men strolled side-by-side down an asphalt road
to the Laurel cabin for the first three-way talks of the summit.
Pausing for a photo op, Clinton put one arm around Barak and the
other around Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton refused to comment on how the meetings were going,
saying all sides had agreed not to publicly comment on the
substance of their meeting. Asked if that was the only agreement
they had reached so far, Clinton shot back, ``That would be
answering a question,'' drawing chuckles.
</P>
<P>
   But that was not the only funny moment of the day. That was
reserved for when Arafat and Barak, both seeking to be courteous,
could not agree on who should enter the cabin first.
</P>
<P>
   Once that was figured out _ Arafat went first _ the three men
and 18 aides (eight for Clinton and five each for Barak and Arafat)
met for half an hour at a long rectangular table. White House press
secretary Joseph Lockart described the atmosphere of the meeting as
``good,'' adding, ``The discussions have been serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton later held an evening round of one-on-one meetings with
Arafat and Barak.
</P>
<P>
   To make time for the summit, Clinton had canceled plans to speak
Tuesday afternoon to the annual convention of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, posponing his
speech until Thursday morning, when he will already be in
Washington for a congressional medal of honor ceremony on Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, meanwhile, Hanan M. Ashrawi, a spokeswoman for
Arafat, told reporters at the National Press Club that the
Israeli-Palestinian talks should start with the premise of a return
to the borders before the 1967 Six-Day War and the return of more
than 3 million refugees now outside the country.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has rejected both demands, but Israeli press reports that
he was prepared to make sizable territorial concessions had
contributed to his pre-summit political woes.
</P>
<P>
   Ashrawi insisted several times Tuesday that Israel could not
strong-arm the Palestinians into a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Making peace, she said, ``is not a concession bestowed by the
strong on the weak, or it is not a result of an imposed or a faulty
agreement, but rather comes from dealing with the causes of
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   She didn't sound optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that the American initiative to call for the
summit is _ I don't know if you can call it a last-ditch attempt or
heroic or a foolhardy attempt to try to achieve something within a
very short period of time. The most that they (the Americans) hope
for is to prevent further deterioriation or a breakdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said he spoke to
Clinton and expressed his ``desire to be helpful'' in financing a
peace settlement. Lott said he would ``have to consider the
American taxpayer,'' but that he had not set a limit on how much in
US funds Clinton could approve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it'd be a responsible thing for me to put a cap
at this point,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott also spoke to Barak and ``wished him well.'' But Lott said
he did not go into details with Barak about the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's involvement in foreign affairs marked a change in his
relationship with White House officials, whom he earlier accused of
purposely leaving congressional Republicans out of the loop. Last
month, Lott complained the Clinton administration ``had stopped the
appropriate consulting process.'' More recently, however, Lott said
Sandy Berger has been in frequent contact, and Lott seemed pleased
Tuesday with his role in the Mideast talks.

MIDEAST TALKS PAST `POINT OF NO RETURN,' CLINTON TELLS TWO SIDES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ President Clinton urged the Israeli and
Palestinian leaders to seek a ``principled compromise'' Tuesday as
he opened the Camp David summit in a high-stakes bid to resolve the
remaining obstacles to a long-sought Middle East peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring the two sides ``have passed the point of no return,''
Clinton told Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat that they must move forward to end more than a
half-century of violence between their peoples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides must find a way to resolve competing claims, to
give their children the gift of peace. It will take patience and
creativity, and courage,'' Clinton said shortly before his first
round of meetings with the two leaders at the Camp David
presidential retreat four miles from this small, rural town.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met first with Arafat at about noon and then with Barak
a short time later, as he sought to gauge their attitudes going
into the summit and what concessions it will take in order to
produce a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said all three leaders had
agreed to impose a news blackout during the summit aimed at
preventing any substance of the discussions from being leaked to
the press.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the leaders had little to say as they strolled
along a winding asphalt path on their way to the Laurel cabin. They
stopped only briefly to pose for press photographers, but declined
to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pledged to each other we would answer no questions and
offer no comment, and I'd like to set a good example,'' Clinton
said, as he stood with one arm around Barak, the other around
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that the only agreement you have reached so far?'' one
reporter ventured.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be answering a question,'' Clinton replied,
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Barak and Arafat could be seen engaged in a
playful tugging match, as each sought to give way to the other when
entering the Laurel cabin to begin their first face-to-face
session. It appeared that the two, still smiling, finally gave up
their brief, diplomatic tango and crossed the threshold together.
But a U.S. official said later that Arafat finally acceded to
Barak's courtesy and walked through the door ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   The amusing scene, which played itself out as Clinton stood by
laughing, belied the tough work ahead and the hard-line differences
that remain between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke of the difficulty before the talks began.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two leaders face profound and wrenching questions, and
there can be no success without principled compromise. The road to
peace, as always, is a two-way street,'' Clinton said, adding that
he believes Barak and Arafat ``recognize this is a moment in
history which they can seize.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, there is no guarantee of success, but not to try is
to guarantee failure,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is hoping that the remoteness and history of Camp David,
where former President Carter helped Israel and Egypt forge their
peace deal in 1978, will encourage Barak and Arafat to break down
the final barriers to a comprehensive peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the progress already made in the Arab-Israeli peace
process, from the historic Camp David accords to the Oslo agreement
seven years ago establishing the framework for a
Palestinian-Israeli peace, Clinton said, ``the parties have proven
that peace is possible when they are determined to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   The president suggested last week that it might be possible to
attain at least the outline of a final deal before he departs July
19 for the annual summit of the Group of Eight leading industrial
nations in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But White House officials have since played down the idea of
wrapping up a deal in a matter of days, saying that it may be
necessary to resume the talks when Clinton returns from Japan or
hold a second round of negotiations at Camp David later in August.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how the talks unfold, striking a deal will not be
easy. It will have to settle their competing claims to Jerusalem,
the final borders of a Palestinian state, the status of Palestinian
refugees and what to do about 40,000 Jewish settlers in the West
Bank who will have to be moved.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians demonstrated how difficult the task is.
Speaking at the National Press Club in Washington on Tuesday,
Palestinian spokeswoman Hanan Ashrawi said that life for her people
``has become worse under the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis, she said, have failed to meet many of the terms
set out in the Oslo accords of seven years ago that were designed
to guide the transfer of lands captured in the 1967 Six Day War
back to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Israel has returned control of only about 40 percent of
the occupied lands. June 23 was supposed to be the deadline for
Israel's withdrawal from nearly all of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. Ashrawi said Israel has also allowed the expansion of
Israeli settlements in the West Bank to continue and has tightened
its control over Jerusalem even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel should not come to the negotiations with extremist
positions, such as not returning to the 1967 boundaries or
maintaining sovereignty over Jerusalem,'' Ashrawi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being extremely realistic, I don't expect to see a miraculous,
substantive breakthrough because the issues are complex. I have
read the Israel proposals and the gap is extremely wide. It will
take a great deal of effort to find areas of consensus, even
convergence,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, meanwhile, is entering the talks reportedly ready to
relinquish Israeli control of up to 90 percent of the West Bank,
including the strategic Jordan Valley, and may be prepared as well
to redivide Jerusalem in order to make room for a Palestinian
capital.
</P>
<P>
   The status of Jerusalem and the final boundaries of a
Palestinian state are the thorniest of all the issues involved in
the peace process. Barak's positions have outraged Israeli
hard-liners who are basically opposed to any peace deal that
sacrifices Jewish settlements in the occupied territories or gives
up any part of the old walled city of East Jerusalem to Palestinian
control.
</P>
<P>
   Three factions of his ruling coalition have already resigned
because of the Israeli leader's eagerness to make peace. Barak was
able to survive a vote of confidence in the Israeli Knesset on
Monday, but he has promised that any agreement reached at the
summit will be put to a vote of the Israeli people.

BAD NEWS DOES   BEAT OUT THE REST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 16)  
 By VICKI GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Now for the bad news: good news is on vacation.
Permanently.
</P>
<P>
   In the news media, anyway, ``no news is good news'' just might
be read as ``there is no such thing as good news,'' something local
television has been trying to convince viewers of for years. That
goes double for news photography: the news photographs you remember
are likely to compose a litany of grief and terror, from the murder
of Lee Harvey Oswald to the execution of a Vietcong prisoner on the
streets of Saigon to the dragging of a dead American soldier's body
through the streets of Mogadishu, Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures of those three events won Pulitzer Prizes. A show
called ``The Pulitzer Prize Photographs: Capture the Moment,'' at
the Newseum/NY in midtown Manhattan through Sept. 23, reinforces
the widespread impression that news tends to be violent and morbid.
Smiles, joy, tenderness and near misses exist in the Pulitzer
world, and fine extended captions relate that some of the rescue
attempts recorded here were successful, but most of the more than
100 pictures are almost equally endowed with visual distinction and
despair. Plummeting bodies, starving children and dead men in the
dust tend to crowd out the reassuring images of soldiers reunited
with their families and policemen being nice to little boys.
</P>
<P>
   The Pulitzer Prizes were established by Joseph Pulitzer, the
newspaper magnate, early in this century, with a bequest of $2
million to Columbia University to set up a school of journalism and
prizes for journalism, letters, music, drama and education as well
as traveling scholarships. (The university's president was at first
reluctant, fearing that a journalism school would diminish its
intellectual reputation.) The first prizes were given in 1917. In
1942, photography was added to the list, appropriately, for
photographs had already taken over the news. Tabloids and picture
magazines had made photographs not only central but essential. On
March 1, 1920, for example, The New York Times had no photographs
at all, but on an average day in 1938, The Times published a
picture on almost every news page. The Pulitzer Prize board created
a separate category for feature photographs in 1968, after faster
film and new small cameras like the Nikon had changed the
photographic territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Capture the Moment,'' the largest collection of Pulitzer
Prize-winning photographs ever shown in this country, includes
pictures for every year from 1942 to 1999 except for 1946, when the
judges thought no entry worth a prize.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition moves to the Newseum in Arlington, Va., in
the.newseum.org. Curiously, the first large survey of this
distinctly American award was recently put on in Japan by and for
the Japanese, who have won Pulitzers a couple of times. (Pulitzer
submissions must have appeared in an American newspaper but need
not be by American citizens.)
</P>
<P>
   The first Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph was a picture of a
group of strikers beating a man; the 1999 photographs recorded the
carnage of the embassy bombing in Nairobi and several stages in the
Monica Lewinsky affair: from violence to violence, with a stop at
sex and shame.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   The common cant is that news (and games and films and music and
so on) have become more violent, which may well be true, but it is
a mistake to think the news was once a teddy bear that turned into
a grizzly when other media came along.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers have included some measure of violence ever since
they stopped being commercial reports or political party organs in
the 1830s and began to sell for as little as a penny, appeal to a
broader audience and redefine news as accounts of large and small
events all over the world. Penny papers carried entire transcripts
of murder trials, something the old-fashioned kind of paper claimed
to find shocking. By the 1840s, engraved illustrations changed the
look of the news, and numerous papers found that pictures of
accused murderers, not to mention engravers' reconstructions of
actual killings, infallibly improved circulation figures.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the great bulk of visual news was and remains pretty tame,
relatively inert and unthreatening. It might be an image of rival
politicians pretending to respect each other, or the publicity
photograph of someone who was alive enough to pose for it until he
died of a heart attack last night, or perhaps a picture of football
players imitating pile drivers in a championship maneuver. Images
like these do not bore holes in the memory. The pictures that do,
though fewer, crowd out the rest by the size of the reaction they
create. Tragedy and violence get our attention, partly because they
are so fearsome, partly because they are, outside of a war zone,
relatively unusual. Dog bites man isn't news because it's all too
ordinary. Murder, on the other hand, is no more of an everyday
occurrence for most people than man bites dog.
</P>
<P>
   Relative rarity is obviously not the whole story. The pictures
of the kinds of events that have dominated the Pulitzers _ a
Japanese about to run a sword through a politician; a plane crashed
and burning in a suburban yard; a wounded soldier clinging
desperately to a priest in the midst of gunfire; a young woman
screaming over a dead student at Kent State _ are uncommon in many
ways. They are uncommonly well observed, which does not necessarily
mean artistic or aesthetic. They do capture a moment, a drama, at
some hideous and telling peak, stopping time so precipitously that
the mind involuntarily braces for what is implied and what must
come next _ the sword in the flesh, the crumpled bodies hidden now
by smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Danger, suffering and death magnetize the eyes for reasons that
are embedded in the nature of human existence. Pain and suffering
are hardly rare and death is ultimately ubiquitous, no matter how
uncommon it may be to meet it at the end of a sword. All of us
expend huge amounts of (mostly unconscious) energy avoiding even
thinking about pain or death, particularly our own, but pictures
are just removed enough and the people in them unknown and
unknowable enough to make looking at them seem temporarily safer
than dwelling on ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Death is probably the ultimate fascination: what is it? what
happens when it arrives? what does it look like? how will it come
to me and how will I face it? Not that way, the news picture
whispers; not at that extreme. If that plane crashed, doesn't that
mean that mine has a better chance of arriving safely? Although
pictures of suffering, torture, starvation, death inflicted on the
innocent can make us judge humankind harshly and diminish our
self-respect in the process, to some small degree they might also
be reassuring: not me, not this time, not ever.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs of extreme situations frequently carry with them an
aura of derring-do, of danger and unbearable emotion outside the
fierce events they picture. How did the photographer get that
picture? Why did fate arrange for someone to be there at that
precise and hazardous instant? It goes without saying that war
photographers were under fire at the moment they clicked the
shutter, heroically or foolishly but certainly professionally
recording history, or at least garnering information. Many have
died in pursuit of that goal, and the death rate is increasing as
military, rebel and terrorist groups put journalists onto their hit
lists. Other kinds of dangers also attend the job. Photographers
chronicling refugees and starvation must have to overcome the
normal reactions of horror and pity in order simply to make the
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Some burn out. In 1993, Kevin Carter, a South African
photojournalist, took a grim picture of a Sudanese child trying to
crawl to a feeding center while a vulture sat nearby. He chased the
bird away after taking the picture, and then he cried. After the
photograph was published, people reacted with outrage: why hadn't
he picked the child up? In fact, journalists had been expressly
instructed not to touch famine victims because of the risk of
disease. Nonetheless, Carter was torn by regrets. Doubtless he had
other troubles as well. He died in 1994 at the age of 33, an
apparent suicide _ three months after he won the Pulitzer. (MORE)  &QL; 
 &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the attractions of violent (or malevolent) imagery were
neither discovered nor invented by the camera or by other modern
media. Long before photography, hangings and beheadings were
memorialized in inexpensive woodcuts that were snapped up by the
droves of people who came out for the occasions or were unfortunate
enough to miss the main events. Well into the 19th century,
executions were holidays in many countries, and schools were let
out so that children could witness them. It was generally believed
that witnessing the rewards of sin would deter the witnesses from
following the same road, and that the sinner's repentance would be
particularly instructive.
</P>
<P>
   Public executions went private as governments realized that the
excitement they occasioned would not only fail to improve crime
statistics but could even incite disturbances. The moral value of
witnessing is still the main rationale for photographs of all kinds
of calamities, despite the intrusion of sensationalism into the mix
(or its continued presence). The first principle is that the public
needs to know, the second is the lingering belief that a public
aware of injustice will do something to correct it. The kinds of
horrifying news pictures that are sometimes called immoral and
charged with pandering to our baser instincts and provoking
copy-cat behavior may have begun in idealism and a photographer's
yearning for a righteous place to stand.
</P>
<P>
   An actual place to stand, a location, is as important in
photojournalism as it is in real estate; no amount of talent will
suffice if the photographer is not where the action is. In the
early years of the Pulitzer Prizes, in 1947 and 1954, two amateurs
won the awards. The first was a college student who grabbed his
camera when he heard fire trucks and snapped a woman plunging
through the air as she jumped to escape the flames. The second
amateur was a woman who was behind a truck when the truck's
steering went out of control and sent its cab dangling perilously
over the edge of a bridge. As her husband went to the rescue, she
took a picture of one of the two truck drivers being pulled to
safety on a rope, and won a Pulitzer. (The other driver made it,
too, seconds before the cab burst into flames and plunged to the
rocks 70 feet below.)
</P>
<P>
   The fact that amateurs could beat out the pros says something
about the nature of news, the omnipresence of cameras and the
democratizing nature of consumer technology. Years ago, inexpensive
and easy-to-operate cameras made almost everyone a potential
recorder of the news. The video camera did it again, and the
Internet is democratizing the means of distribution. Tiny cameras
are currently threatening to be everywhere, in computers and Palm
Pilots and cell phones. The next time a man bites a dog, someone
will probably record it.
</P>
<P>
   That's the good news. It might be hard to find more. &QL;

   Yahoo's Quarterly Profit Beats Analysts' Estimates
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings, quelling
investor concerns that consolidation and business failures among
struggling dot-coms might hurt its revenue base. Yahoo reported net
income of $65.5 million, or 11 cents a share, exceeding analysts'
projections of 10 cents a share. Revenue was $270.1 million, up
from $128.6 million in the period a year earlier, and beat
analysts' forecasts of $240 million. Shares of Yahoo fell $4.50, to
$105.50, before the results were announced, but they rebounded as
high as $121 in after-hours trading.

   China Looks to Pick Up Reform Pace
</P>
<P>
   Though China has been marching on the road toward economic
change for more than two decades, barriers to capital formation
keep most private businesses from providing more than a handful of
jobs. There is growing pressure to change that. With World Trade
Organization membership expected to open the domestic market wider
to foreign companies, foreigners could take over a huge part of the
economy unless China unleashes private entrepreneurs soon.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of Senate Republicans urged their leader, Trent Lott,
to delay until September a vote on a major bill establishing
permanent normal trade relations with China.

   Lessons on Capability and Integrity

<P>
   Ronald Dollens, chief executive of Guidant, says he learned
life's lessons from his father during drives to and from work at
the family grocery store: ``He taught me about integrity and
respecting people no matter what their stature. He had a
wallhanging in the kitchen: `Don't try to teach a pig to sing. It
wastes your time and annoys the pig.' I have that saying framed in
my office. It reminds me that you have to start with a certain
amount of capability or you're pretty limited in what you can do.''

THE BAREFOOT SEEK WIGGLE ROOM 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOMBARD, Ill. _ ``From the ankles up,'' Gordon Hlavenka said,
``I'm a fairly normal person.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, because from the ankles up, Hlavenka is fully clothed.
</P>
<P>
   But his feet _ sans shoes, sans socks _ were on a kind of
kamikaze mission in this well-heeled Chicago suburb recently,
padding into a bank, a market, McDonald's for a cheeseburger and
fries, and Wal-Mart, where an employee barked, ``Can't walk around
here without shoes _ that's against the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Shrugging off such shoeism, Hlavenka politely replied that
bare-footing is legal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take a bullet for the cause,'' said Hlavenka, who runs an
electronics store, barefoot. ``Usually I only have my shoes on
about an hour or two a week.''
</P>
<P>
   The barefoot cause is apparently gaining ground. Hundreds of
otherwise conventional people are baring their toes in
unconventional places, saying it is comfortable, liberating,
environmentally friendly, even spiritually enlivening. Some like
the adrenaline rush of rebellion that spices their lives. They like
feeling through their feet _ pebbly sidewalks, grainy dirt, velvety
moss, polished floors. Many do it year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Adams, mayor of Sharon Springs, N.Y., near Schenectady,
has gone barefoot in museums, restaurants, at his logging company
and walking to Village Hall. ``I try to be shod when I'm being
mayor, try to remember to wear shoes,'' said Adams, 53, who owns
size 12 wingtips. ``But often I just don't have them.''
</P>
<P>
   Marnen Laibow-Koser, 25, a violinist from Peekskill, N.Y., has
barefooted nonstop since May 5, playing concerts in Manhattan in
tux and toes. Alicia Poe, 28, of Queens, with her daughters, ages 2
and 3, barefoots everywhere from Fifth Avenue to the Bronx Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. David Vallelunga of the United Methodist Church in
Saratoga Springs, N.Y., enjoys secular barefooting so much he
performs services and weddings that way _ ``my exodus,'' he calls
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bare feet is symbolic of innocence and simpler times,''
Vallelunga, 39, said. ``The Greeks fought barefoot. Everything
changed in the world when you could step on the dead body of a foe
with impunity. We pay more for sneakers in this country than people
in some countries make in a year. Plus, I feel very confined and
out of touch when I'm in shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Robert Neinast of Pickerington, Ohio, and his
Gandhiesque standoff on a vacation to Washington last summer. After
barefooting to the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials (``the marble
steps are just so nice to step on''), he was forced into flip-flops
by guards at the Smithsonian Institution. He wrote the museum to
complain, enclosing proof that barefooting there is legal, received
a conciliatory letter, and revisited with 10 barefoot compatriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a thick skin, not just on the soles of your feet,''
said Neinast, 45, a software engineer at Lucent Technologies,
where, he said, barefooting in the halls sent him to ``a
psychological evaluation.'' He added, ``Now I just do it at my
desk.''
</P>
<P>
   Neinast's civil rights victory notwithstanding, barefooters are
not numerous enough for, say, a Million Toes March (although that
is only 100,000 people). But the Dirty Sole Society, dedicated to
``helping one another to get along in a shod world,'' has attracted
more than 600 members since its inception a few years ago. There is
Parents for Barefoot Children and 17 chapters of Barefoot Hikers,
whose practitioners include Adams, whose toughened, calloused feet
have hiked all 46 High Peaks of the Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one more sensory avenue,'' Adams said. ``You pick up a
lot of information through your feet. Wearing shoes is a little
like wearing mittens or a tie. If you don't have to, why wear
them?''
</P>
<P>
   Many say the Internet emboldened them to shoe-tree their
loafers. The Web site www.barefooters.org debunks the widespread
assumption that laws ban barefooters from driving or entering most
stores, restaurants and workplaces. (Businesses may set
no-bare-feet policies.) While most podiatrists say shoes are
essential for protection and support, the Web site quotes articles
suggesting bare feet are less prone to athlete's foot and hammer
toes and are healthy unconstricted.
</P>
<P>
   As for stepping on filth or broken glass, the site advises,
``Watch where you're going!'' People constantly scrape their hands
and ``no body thinks, `This would not have happened if I wore
gloves,''' it says. The site suggests retorts to critics and lists
barefoot-friendly businesses, including a dentist and a barefoot
real estate broker in California, and a beer-brewing supply store
in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows you that you're not alone, you're not that
peculiar,'' Neinast said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web site is an enabler,'' said Hlavenka, who keeps backup
size 11{ EE sneakers in his car. ``It's like, `Hello, my name is
Gordon and I hate to admit this but I wore shoes yesterday.'''
</P>
<P>
   Like many, Hlavenka, 42, began tentatively, after sneakers he
bought three years ago made his feet smell. He barefooted around
the block at night so neighbors would not see. He went to
self-serve gas stations, eventually going inside for milk. Now he
says he primarily reserves his shoes for church, and when his wife
makes him ``chameleon'' it. He even shovels snow barefoot.
</P>
<P>
   Some barefooters push society's envelope; others avoid
confrontation, especially when shod friends and family members are
along.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Lucas, founder of the Dirty Sole Society, wears soleless
sandals to restaurants. Jill Hamell of Parsippany, N.J., who says
barefooting eased painful foot problems, has tackled Penn Station
and Midtown Manhattan, but slipped on sandals for Starbucks. (Tip:
Women carrying shoes get fewer glares; people assume they are
resting sore feet.)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Vallelunga wears shoes on hospital visits and at funerals. Mike
Berrow, a Web designer, meets vendors and prospective employees
barefoot but wears shoes when trying to sell clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to try to talk places into letting me stay, sneak in or
hold a bag so they couldn't see my feet,'' said Berrow, who founded
Parents for Barefoot Children and whose son sometimes barefoots to
his alternative high school. ``You realize most of the battles are
within your own mind, your own feeling like, `Oh, my God, I'm going
to stick out like a sore thumb.'''
</P>
<P>
   But there are war stories about people who sneer, assume the
barefooter is poor, uneducated or worse. Poe said that while she
was driving in her New York City neighborhood last fall, six men
who recognized her hurled barefoot insults and ``tried to break
into my car and drag me out.'' Laibow-Koser, evicted from the
Peekskill library, may consult a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas of Mountain View, Calif., was ejected from the Billy
DeFrank Lesbian and Gay Community Center in San Jose, which said it
feared liability for possible injuries. (Barefooters say they are
responsible for their injuries.) Marian Rosenberg, 19, of
Baltimore, was convicted of disorderly conduct and other charges
after tangling with a security guard over barefooting in a
drugstore, where she had gone to buy sandals for Rosh Hashanah
services.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, his soles dark with dust, Hlavenka anticipated
rejection on his store rounds. But aside from the Wal-Mart
imbroglio, not much happened.
</P>
<P>
   At McDonald's, despite a sign erroneously banning bare feet ``by
order of the Department of Health,'' employees let him eat. At Cub
Foods, an assistant manager, when asked, said it was against store
policy, but ``his feet are no dirtier than shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the market's tuna fish aisle, contemptuous customers shot
him what he calls ``the look.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the ones that have their toes pointed in the wrong
direction,'' Hlavenka said. ``And they have bunions.''

</P>
<P>
   Day Three: The theme is ``Rediscovering the Human Side of Al
Gore,'' including a yet-to-be-selected Gore family tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Day Four: The theme is ``Rediscovering the Lighter Side of Al
Gore,'' including hilarious and beloved comedy routines where I
balance a broom on my nose, do the booty-call line dance and
hypnotize chickens.

WACO JURY NOT LIKELY TO HEAR FROM 2 MAIN FBI WITNESSES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Every afternoon this week, Branch Davidian
attorney Michael Caddell has left the federal courtroom and posed
the same two questions to a knot of reporters on the sidewalk
outside: ``Where's Richard Rogers? Where's Jeff Jamar?''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers and Jamar were the two principal FBI commanders during
the assault on Mount Carmel that resulted in the fiery deaths of
David Koresh and more than 80 or his Davidian followers seven years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Their testimony was promised at the beginning of the trial of
the Davidians' wrongful death lawsuit against the government, but
the judge and jury have yet to hear from either man. As the trial
winds toward a possible Friday finish it is increasingly unlikely
they will.
</P>
<P>
   The refusal of either side to call the two retired FBI agents is
but one of numerous oddities in a trial that began nearly four
weeks ago with global publicity and now rarely makes the front
pages except in the local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   High-profile witnesses, such as Atty. Gen. Janet Reno and former
FBI director William Sessions, appeared only in videotaped
depositions. The jury met many of the key FBI and Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents through written statements
alone.
</P>
<P>
   The judge so limited the range of subject matter that could be
covered that many witnesses _ including some who were in the
courtroom and ready to testify _ were kept from taking the stand.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been the absence of Rogers, who was in charge of the
hostage rescue team, and Jamar, special agent in charge of the
siege at Mount Carmel, that has been the most glaring because a
cornerstone of the plaintiffs' case turns on their actions that
Monday in April 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleges, among other things, that Reno approved a
plan to end the 51-day standoff with tear gas but Jamar and Rogers
acted on their own, contrary to Reno's plan and the advice of
hostage negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department plan had called for Davidians to be given
48 hours to leave the compound once the tear gas was sprayed
inside. What happen instead was that tanks began demolishing the
building two hours after the gas was inserted. One government
witness testified Tuesday that there apparently was no plan to
continue the operation for 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Harris, an FBI agent who drove a tank equipped with a
bulldozer blade that day, was called to bolster the government's
argument that no order was given to demolish the building at the
time the fatal fire began.
</P>
<P>
   He said his orders were to clear a path for the tear gas tanks
by crashing through the gymnasium to reach a three-story tower
where many Davidians were believed hiding.
</P>
<P>
   His tank clipped a corner of the building and caused the roof to
collapse, but it was ``unintentional on my part,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said he entered the gym but stopped 20 yards short of the
tower. He backed up and re-entered the gym several times,
apparently damaging it more each time. But he insisted his mission
was not to destroy the building.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when he was recommended for an agency award, the citation
said his mission was ``the systematic demolition of Mount Carmel.''
</P>
<P>
   On the witness stand, Harris said that was ``completely
inaccurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell forced Harris to admit he told a different story Tuesday
than one he told in a deposition more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would agree,'' Caddell said, ``that after 45 minutes you
had pretty well destroyed the gymnasium?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I wouldn't,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell then produced the deposition in which Harris had stated
twice that he had ``pretty well destroyed'' the gym in 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   After the trial recessed, Caddell told reporters that, ``Harris
is a nice guy in a bad spot ... he was sent here to save Dick
Rogers' butt.``
</P>
<P>
   The reasons that Rogers and Jamar have not appeared in court to
speak for themselves are vague.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell has taunted government attorneys for not calling the
two. U.S. Attorney Mike Bradford of Beaumont, who is the lead
attorney for the government, returned some of the barbs Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not subpoena Rogers and Jamar because Caddell had
placed them on his witness list.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening statement to the jury last month, Bradford said,
``Jeff Jamar and Richard Rogers will come here to this courtroom
and will testify to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday he said that statement was in response to Caddell's
request that the government make the two men available as
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He backed down,'' Bradford said. ``He sued us. This is his
case. He has accused these two men of a serious wrongdoing and he
had a perfect opportunity to put them on the stand and prove that.
We had them available.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell had said earlier that he had not called the two men
because the judge had limited each side's presentation to 40 hours
and he had run out of time.
</P>
<P>
   So, the five-member jury sitting as an advisory panel to U.S.
District Judge Walter Smith will have to weigh the decision made by
FBI agents without hearing from the agents themselves.

A poll in the latest Ladies' Home Journal found that if voters were

SCIENTIFIC PANEL CITES DANGERS OF MERCURY IN SEAFOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A prestigious panel of scientists declared yesterday that levels
of the most hazardous form of mercury in the environment posed an
unacceptable health risk to children born of women who eat fish
during pregnancy, and should be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   That finding by the 10 scientists, convened by the National
Academy of Sciences, essentially ends a rancorous debate waged
between industry and environmental officials for more than a
decade. At issue was how to deal with methylmercury, a toxic metal
that occasionally taints popular seafood like tuna and by now has
also prompted 41 states to issue warnings against eating fish
caught in many rivers and lakes.
</P>
<P>
   In unambiguous terms, the panel said on Tuesday that warnings
did not suffice. ``The long-term goal,'' its report said, ``needs
to be a reduction in the concentrations.''
</P>
<P>
   The report clears the way for the Environmental Protection
Agency, after long delay, to write new regulations forcing electric
power plants, the last large source of unregulated emissions of
mercury, to cut them. Coal-burning power plants release more than
40 tons of mercury a year, about a third of the total entering the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental agency was poised two years ago to write new
mercury rules for plants, but met heavy resistance from members of
Congress, who in turn were encountering intense lobbying from the
electric power industry. The industry pushed hard for an
independent study on the risks of methylmercury, created in nature
by the interaction between mercury and bacteria, and Congress
responded by directing the EPA to commission it. The work was
undertaken by the 10 scientists, brought together by the academy's
National Research Council.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the power industry on Tuesday accepted the
panel's conclusions, thereby effectively ending their opposition to
the EPA's plans and shifting the debate over mercury regulation
from if to how.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted this issue about mercury to be settled based on the
best science available, and that's essentially what the academy has
done,'' said Paul Bailey, vice president for environmental affairs
at the Edison Electric Institute, a trade group representing
companies that generate three-fourths of the country's electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect the EPA to decide that they are going to regulate
mercury from us,'' he said. ``What we're focused on is working with
them to fashion a program that makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said the industry would favor a system of pollution
credits much like that which now governs industrial emissions of
sulfur dioxide. Environmental groups would oppose that approach.
</P>
<P>
   The panel of scientists estimated that 60,000 children are born
each year who were exposed during pregnancy to methylmercury levels
that could cause neurological and learning problems. Most exposure
comes from fish in their mothers' diet.
</P>
<P>
   Through rain and runoff, methylmercury tends to concentrate in
lakes, rivers and streams, where it accumulates in fish as it
passes up the food chain. Relying on warnings alone concerning fish
is an inadequate approach to protecting public health, the panel
said, in part because it will deprive people of a nutritious food.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials said they felt vindicated by the report and
intended to press ahead with a decision by Dec. 15 on limiting
mercury emitted by power plants. That date was set in settlement of
a lawsuit brought by some private environmental groups to force the
agency to consider mercury cuts under provisions of the Clean Air
Act.
</P>
<P>
   The report ``underscores and reinforces the science that will go
into that policy decision and others that will follow with regard
to controlling mercury,'' said David Cohen, a spokesman for the
environmental agency.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups said the end of the scientific debate over
power plants was long overdue, noting that they were the last large
uncontrolled source of mercury emissions. David Hawkins, director
of air and energy programs for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, pointed out that as a result of government regulation
already in effect, owners of incinerators, another big source, were
adding filters and other equipment to capture the metal before it
leaves smokestacks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The debate now shifts to how best to cut the flow of mercury
from coal to power-plant smoke and on into the environment. Last
year the EPA initiated the first significant study of the problem,
requiring not only that all power plants measure the amount of
mercury in coal through 1999 but also that several dozen measure
the amounts emitted from smokestacks before and after the
installation of filters.
</P>
<P>
   The report issued on Tuesday, after the scientists' 18-month
review of EPA's risk calculation for mercury, concluded that the
most important hazard by far lay in the threat to developing
fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   It emphasized that the risk to most people was very small, and
that the primary goal was to cut the exposure in young women who
frequently eat fish in which the highest levels of mercury tend to
accumulate _ generally predatory sea fish like tuna and swordfish
but also some freshwater fish in places with high mercury levels.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said the report could also be an influence in
whether the Food and Drug Administration tightens its standards for
fish. The food agency now uses a much less aggressive risk
calculation than the EPA calculation endorsed by the scientists on
Tuesday. FDA officials said they had not yet had time to review the
mercury report.

RESEARCHERS SEEKING BETTER USE OF EXISTING THERAPIES TO COMBAT
AIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ As the widely publicized hopes of a cure
for AIDS have vanished and the limitations of standard drug therapy
have become increasingly apparent, scientists are urgently seeking
new strategies to make better use of therapies they have,
researchers said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Their discussion took place here at the 13th international AIDS
conference.
</P>
<P>
   One strategy came from a top U.S. government scientist who
announced promising early findings from two new trials aimed at
giving long breaks in treatment to people infected with HIV, the
virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to help the body cope with the virus on its own for
varying periods and make it easier for infected people to take the
drugs. But the interrupted therapy would not be a cure.
</P>
<P>
   Need for such new solutions was underscored by studies reported
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention questioning how
long the drug combinations being used will remain effective against
the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Combinations of anti-HIV drugs successfully suppressed the virus
for 12 months or more in only one-third of infected Americans, so
patients are having to change drugs and regimens increasingly often
to maintain their benefits, said Dr. Scott Holmberg, an
epidemiologist at the CDC.
</P>
<P>
   No one here is questioning that many infected people have
benefited greatly from the combinations of newer and older anti-HIV
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Mauro Schechter of Brazil said scientists might have
overestimated the contributions of the group of drugs known as
protease inhibitors in lowering the death rates from AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Other drugs, which prevent the many secondary infections that
result when HIV damages the immune system, have received less
credit than they deserve in lowering death rates, Schechter, of the
University of Rio de Janiero, said in urging a renewed interest in
such drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Schechter also said that giving patients a break from taking
their pills for extended, planned periods could make drug regimens
safer and more affordable if studies showed the technique to be
successful.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the head of the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md., said many studies
had made it ``clear that eradication of HIV is not possible with
the drugs currently available,'' and that prolonged or lifetime
courses of drug combinations were not feasible for most infected
people.
</P>
<P>
   The sobering realization contrasts with the optimism, if not
euphoria, that enveloped the AIDS meeting in Vancouver in 1996,
when leading experts talked about the prospects of curing AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Fauci reported that he and scientists at medical centers in the
United States and Europe were conducting trials on the
effectiveness of various ways to give interrupted therapy. For
example, participants in some studies stop taking drugs for varying
periods of time until HIV rebounds to a predetermined level in
their blood.
</P>
<P>
   Fauci's team has begun two small trials to determine whether
patients can stop and restart therapy for specified periods in
well-defined cycles. Both trials include people who took drugs that
suppressed HIV to levels undetectable by blood tests.
</P>
<P>
   One trial involves 70 participants. Half are taking their drugs
continuously. The others are taking the drugs for two months and
then stopping them for one month. In nine participants, the virus
rose when they stopped taking the drugs _ although to lower levels
each time _ but returned to undetectable levels after they resumed
the same therapy.
</P>
<P>
   In the second study, participants are alternating drug therapy
for a week and then stopping for a week in repetitive cycles. The
week's break does not give the virus enough time to rebound except
in a rare case, Fauci said.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed hope that over time, cycles might be extended so
patients could forgo drug therapy for six to eight months. In an
interview, he said that ``we are not trying to immunize them to the
point where we could completely stop therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   Because less medication would be taken, the intermittent therapy
presumably would reduce unwanted side-effects.
</P>
<P>
   To Fauci, the greatest potential benefit of intermittent therapy
would be in providing Africans an easier and more affordable way to
take the drugs that are widely used in rich countries.
</P>
<P>
   A drawback is that the tests to measure HIV levels in the blood
are now needed before individuals start the intermittent therapy,
and the tests are not widely available in Africa. But Fauci
expressed hope that if the studies document the therapy's benefits,
simpler ways will be found to carry it out in Africa, where AIDS
has hit with devastating force.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is planned, the interrupted therapy being tested in
the studies differs from the drug holidays that many infected
people take on their own, running the risk of creating viral
resistance to drugs.

 &HT;    Era of state budget surpluses may be over in Texas
 &HT;    By Gary Susswein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - The era of state surpluses may be giving way to
a new era of budgetary belt-tightening in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   State leaders plan to use higher-than-expected tax revenues from
this year to cover about $610 million in cost overruns in the
current 2000-2001 budget. Once they've done that, they don't expect
to have much extra cash left to roll into the 2002-2003 budget,
which begins Sept. 1, 2001. That two-year budget will be crafted
when lawmakers reconvene in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be ample revenue in the state to meet the current
obligations,'' Lt. Gov. Rick Perry said Tuesday. ``Over and above
those obligations, I don't expect much of a budget surplus. We are
going to be fiscally conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry and others said the state can afford to pay for existing
school, social service and criminal justice programs even as Texas'
population grows. But it won't be able to expand those programs, as
it did when it approved teachers' pay raises and increased
eligibility for children's health insurance last year.
</P>
<P>
   Unanticipated revenue in the 2000-2001 budget has been estimated
at $1 billion, though exact figures won't be available until
December. In addition to that money, about another $150 million is
expected to be left over by other agencies. After paying off the
overruns, the state would have about $540 million to roll over to
the next budget cycle _ less than 10 percent of what it rolled from
the 1998-1999 budget into the current budget.
</P>
<P>
   The budget overruns are being caused by higher-than-expected
costs in existing state programs. Those rising costs and dwindling
surpluses could have repercussions in the presidential race between
Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Critics on Tuesday blamed the new fiscal trend on $1.7 billion
in tax cuts that Bush helped push through the Legislature last
year. They also faulted the Legislature's unwillingness to pump
money into the state's $70 million rainy-day fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear when we had a so-called surplus that the
governor's top priority for it was tax cuts. This now shows what
the weaknesses of that was,'' said Dick Lavine of the Center for
Public Policy Priorities. The nonprofit group generally opposes tax
cuts because it says there are unmet needs in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to anticipate (that there will be) unanticipated
expenses. We had established, during the dark days of the late
1980s, a rainy-day fund which has now been drained to almost
nothing,'' Lavine said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials dismissed those criticisms and downplayed the
$610 million in unanticipated expenses in health care and criminal
justice. Since the state also is receiving more tax dollars than
expected this year, lawmakers said they will be able to cover costs
when they meet again in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may not have done as good a job at estimating costs, but
it's more than made up for by increased revenue so there is no
budget crisis,'' said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Bill
Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff and others blamed the overruns _ the highest in recent
sessions _ on flawed projections of prescription drug costs for
Medicaid recipients and on the state's prison population.
</P>
<P>
   The overruns in the current $98.2 billion budget include $440
million in unexpected health care costs _ most of that from the
higher-than-expected prescription drug costs and some from
inaccurate projections at the Texas Council on Alcohol and Drug
Abuse. They also include $170 million in unanticipated criminal
justice expenses, including the prison costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of people being paroled out of prison is fewer than
we thought would occur,'' said House Appropriations Chairman Rob
Junell, D-San Angelo. ``There's no way when you're in a two-year
budget cycle that you can predict (accurately) unless you
over-appropriate, which I don't want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The inaccurate projections coincide with the first slowdown in
the state surplus in more than a decade. Texas still is collecting
more revenues this year than officials had projected, but those
anticipated revenues will likely be smaller than they were during
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent slowdown stems from several factors, including the
recent tax cuts and a slight cooling of the state's economy, which
was growing about 7 percent a year in the late 1990s and is now
growing between 4 percent and 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going at a moderate growth rate while we had been going
at a blistering growth rate for awhile,'' Comptroller Carole Keeton
Rylander said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Linda Edwards said she believes the state still
will see some surplus at the end of the budget cycle. And she said
the criticisms of Bush's tax cuts rang hollow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly a bipartisan majority of both the House and Senate
agreed with Governor Bush that in times of plenty we should meet
state needs and fund priorities such as education and return the
leftover surplus to the taxpayers who earned it,'' she said.

 &HT;    Viewing of Grunow shooting video set for Friday
 &HT;    By Susan Spencer-Wendel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In a 300-seat room usually used for
assembling jurors, the public can see and judge for themselves the
shooting that rocked a community.
</P>
<P>
   A public viewing of the Lake Worth Middle School surveillance
tape of Nathaniel Brazill firing at Barry Grunow is being set for 3
p.m. Friday at the Palm Beach County Courthouse. The tape, said to
be about 30 seconds long with unclear and distant images, will be
played repeatedly while people are there.
</P>
<P>
   The rare public assembly to view the evidence is a compromise
solution Circuit Judge Richard Wennet ordered last week. Wennet
ruled the tape is a public record and should be released, as all
evidence normally is in a criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   But Wennet forbid any photography or reproduction of it,
preventing the images from appearing in newspapers and on
television which Brazill's attorneys argue would hurt his client's
right to a fair trail.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's showing in the assembly room on the first floor of the
courthouse in West Palm Beach is the court's way of making the tape
public.
</P>
<P>
   People who attend will be asked to sign a form acknowledging the
no-photo policy. Members of the press must also sign before
attending a separate viewing scheduled for 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Judge Walter Colbath Jr. said he'd be surprised if more
than 100 people showed up. ``I could be unpleasantly surprised,
too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So he and courthouse administrators are preparing for more.
Roughly 20 bailiffs or sheriff's deputies will be on hand, Colbath
said. ``They will be there as a subliminal reminder not to take
photographs.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone caught taking a photograph will be detained and possibly
held in contempt of court, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have seen the surveillance tape say it's no more than
30 seconds long, grainy and of poor quality, shot from far down the
Lake Worth Middle School hallway.
</P>
<P>
   Right after the May 26 shooting, Robert Hatcher, now the
school's principal, and police reviewed the tape to make sure the
image had been recorded. Hatcher said Tuesday he cannot see one
positive aspect of showing what he saw to the public.
</P>
<P>
   None of the school's staff members have ever asked to see it and
he doubts anyone ever will, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brazill's defense attorneys had not seen the tape when they
moved to block its release, saying it would violate their
13-year-old client's right to a fair trial. The images would be
played over and over and potential jurors would be prejudiced,
Robert Udell said.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Beach Post and Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel pressed to
have the tape released, arguing it was a critical piece of evidence
and the media and public have a right to see it.
</P>
<P>
   Udell had not seen footage when he made that argument. Since
then, he has seen it and said Brazill's actions on the tape support
the argument that the shooting of Grunow was a tragic accident.
</P>
<P>
   In an already-released videotaped statement Brazill gave to
police right after the shooting, he says the gun went off
accidentally and that he didn't mean to shoot Grunow, a teacher he
considered a good friend.
</P>
<P>
   Brazill is charged as an adult with first-degree murder and he
faces life in prison if convicted. He's also charged with attempted
first-degree murder for pointing the pistol at another teacher
after shooting Grunow. That action, observers say, can also be seen
on the videotape.
</P>
<P>
   The Grunow family has said through their attorney, Bob
Montgomery, that they support whatever the criminal process calls
for, even release of the tape, as painful as it may be.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery, who would likely represent the family in any civil
lawsuit stemming from the shooting, said Tuesday that he has asked
for a copy of the tape for future reference.
</P>
<P>
   The family could view that, if they chose to, he said, adding
that some of Grunow's siblings may want to see what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly not Pam though,'' Montgomery said of Grunow's widow.

<P>
   Although the national crisis over the burning of Black churches
has abated
</P>
<P>
   and the attention of the media is no longer focused on it, the
retreat of this
</P>
<P>
   news story from the spotlight may be a blessing. For the truth
is, an analysis
</P>
<P>
   of the nationwide phenomenon shows that newspapers did a
disturbingly poor job
</P>
<P>
   of explaining the church-burning ``conspiracy,'' reporting it
opaquely and
</P>
<P>
   strewing the issue with highly volatile implications,
particularly when it
</P>
<P>
   came to race.
</P>
<P>
   In short, news coverage of the idea of a conspiracy was unclear,
undefined,
</P>
<P>
   unenlightening, and it may have helped to escalate racial
tension.
</P>
<P>
   The evolution of the story shows how easy it was for the
conspiracy idea to
</P>
<P>
   be picked up by the press. From January 1995 to December 1997,
at least 142
</P>
<P>
   largely Southern Black churches were set on fire by arsonists.
Federal law
</P>
<P>
   enforcement officials and the U.S. national media began to focus
on these
</P>
<P>
   arson-caused fires in the spring 1996, after their swelling
numbers became too
</P>
<P>
   difficult (and too regional) to ignore. Pressure on federal
officials to
</P>
<P>
   investigate the church burnings came from community leaders,
politicians and
</P>
<P>
   ministers, both Black and White, across the country. The
torching of almost 40
</P>
<P>
   Black churches in 11 Southern states over this 18-month period
signaled a
</P>
<P>
   crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The series of Black church burnings in the south has special
historical
</P>
<P>
   resonance. Many Americans saw the fires not only as racially
driven, but also
</P>
<P>
   as a stark reminder of America's dark era of racial strife in
the 1950s and
</P>
<P>
   1960s, when church burnings were a major form of White terrorism
against Black
</P>
<P>
   Americans. During the civil rights movement, scores of Black
churches that
</P>
<P>
   were rallying points for civil rights demonstrations were bombed
or set on
</P>
<P>
   fire. Black Americans tended to see church burnings as a symbol
and reminder
</P>
<P>
   of racist America as well as a sign of deteriorating race
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Frances Berry, chairwoman of the U.S. Commission on Civil
Rights,
</P>
<P>
   labeled the Black church fires ``a wake-up call'' for Americans
to deal with
</P>
<P>
   the nation's race-relations issue. Berry reported that federal
investigations
</P>
<P>
   revealed 70 percent of the Southern Black church fires were
racially
</P>
<P>
   motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to growing outrage over the church fires, President
Clinton in
</P>
<P>
   June 1996 created the National Church Arson Task Force,
including 200 members
</P>
<P>
   from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the FBI and
the U.S. Justice
</P>
<P>
   Department. It was the largest federal task force in history. A
major question
</P>
<P>
   federal officials explored was whether the Black church arsons
were set by
</P>
<P>
   racists, conspirators, copycats or others.
</P>
<P>
   Deval Patrick, U.S. assistant attorney general for civil rights,
who headed
</P>
<P>
   the church task force, said investigations revealed that race
was only one of
</P>
<P>
   several causes. He said some fires had been set by church
members trying
</P>
<P>
   fraudulently to collect insurance money, others by burglars and
some by
</P>
<P>
   pyromaniacs. In a handful of cases, he said, the arsonists
involved were in
</P>
<P>
   hate groups.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick said investigation over a 15-month period found nothing
to show
</P>
<P>
   there was a national conspiracy targeting Black churches. Arsons
at White
</P>
<P>
   churches, he said, approached the number at Black churches, with
both taking
</P>
<P>
   place at record numbers.
</P>
<P>
   However, Patrick said although no organized conspiracy was
found, ``an
</P>
<P>
   intense climate of racism behind the church fires'' did exist.
Profiles of
</P>
<P>
   those arrested, Patrick said, revealed they were generally
White, male and
</P>
<P>
   young, low-income, poorly educated, frequently drunk or high on
drugs, rarely
</P>
<P>
   affiliated with hate groups, but often deeply driven by racism.
In other
</P>
<P>
   words, although conspiracy theories were largely debunked by the
task force,
</P>
<P>
   racist motives were not.
</P>
<P>
   Two prominent figures increased national press coverage. Clinton
drew media
</P>
<P>
   attention with a speech given at the site of a burned church in
June 1996 in
</P>
<P>
   Greelyville, S.C. He vowed that the church burnings would not be
tolerated and
</P>
<P>
   would be intensely investigated by federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   An unprecedented victory
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1997, with increased national press attention,
stiffer
</P>
<P>
   punishments and a louder public outcry, the arson-caused fires
at Black
</P>
<P>
   churches began to decline after about 15 months of National
Church Arsons Task
</P>
<P>
   Force investigations.
</P>
<P>
   In an unprecedented victory for burned Black churches, a South
Carolina
</P>
<P>
   jury of nine Blacks and three Whites in July 1998 ordered the
Klu Klux Klan to
</P>
<P>
   pay $12.6 million to Macedonia Baptist Church. The jury deemed
the Klan's
</P>
<P>
   rhetoric of hate had motivated four Klansmen to set the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several journalists questioned the media coverage's
accuracy and
</P>
<P>
   fairness, charging the press with initial indifference to the
burnings,
</P>
<P>
   simplistic treatment of a complex story, stereotyping the
arsonists as largely
</P>
<P>
   White racists, and escalating public hysteria by hyping the
story as a return
</P>
<P>
   to the tactics of the segregation era.
</P>
<P>
   Despite critics, at least one press defender addressed the
topic. American
</P>
<P>
   Journalism Review writer Joe Holley noted that over a
seven-month period,
</P>
<P>
   journalists prudently ``connected the dots'' in the fires. They
tended to take
</P>
<P>
   place at Southern Black churches in isolated or rural areas with
most of the
</P>
<P>
   arsonists being White. ``It's an example of how the media can be
distracted,
</P>
<P>
   even misled for a while, but given time, are able to right
themselves, regain
</P>
<P>
   their balance, and tease out the complex truth,'' Holley wrote.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Birmingham Post Herald reporter Ted Bryant
criticized
</P>
<P>
   the press for moving from ``indifference'' to ``hysteria'' and
charged that
</P>
<P>
   reporters inaccurately promoted stereotypes of the arsonists as
White
</P>
<P>
   hate-mongers. Michael Kelly, New Yorker magazine writer, also
noted coverage
</P>
<P>
   problems. He said that at first, reporters paid little attention
to the fires
</P>
<P>
   but later went overboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a case of overreaction that seems to have been inspired in
roughly
</P>
<P>
   equal measure by genuine concern, guilt and self-interests, they
leaped on the
</P>
<P>
   bandwagon with near-hysteria as misplaced as their previous
indifference,''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly wrote. Detroit Free Press religion writer David Crumm also
took the
</P>
<P>
   press to task, charging that reporters ignored motives other
than racism and
</P>
<P>
   ``often relied heavily on stereotypes supporting the idea that a
pack of
</P>
<P>
   church-burning racists could be on the loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, none of these critics addressed the fact that one of the
most
</P>
<P>
   confusing aspects of the reporting was the focus on whether they
were part of
</P>
<P>
   a national conspiracy. Although federal investigators say they
found no
</P>
<P>
   national conspiracy at work (such as KKK or militia groups),
coverage of the
</P>
<P>
   issue was confounding rather than informative. This writer's
research study of
</P>
<P>
   newspaper editorials from the Nexis Lexis database and
Editorials on File
</P>
<P>
   showed that only a third of the 109 editorials published on the
burnings
</P>
<P>
   addressed the conspiracy issue and that what was written was
poorly explained
</P>
<P>
   and highly ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   Making an unclear point
</P>
<P>
   For example, a St. Louis Post Dispatch June 12, 1996, editorial
stated that
</P>
<P>
   church fire investigations ``turned up no interstate
conspiracy'' even though
</P>
<P>
   ``several fires have been linked to people with KKK ties.'' But
the editorial
</P>
<P>
   writer's point about the conspiracy issue was unclear. Because
the KKK has
</P>
<P>
   members in chapters across the nation, why would KKK or Aryan
Nation member
</P>
<P>
   involvement not constitute a local (if not a national)
conspiracy? This
</P>
<P>
   unanswered question should have been addressed to help readers
put facts into
</P>
<P>
   perspective.
</P>
<P>
   In a more radical perspective, Noah Chandler of the Center for
Democratic
</P>
<P>
   Renewal in Atlanta, a civil rights watchdog group, called media
focus on the
</P>
<P>
   conspiracy question ``racist conspiracy itself.'' Other
conspiracy labels also
</P>
<P>
   were noted in the press, including what the Houston Chronicle
called a
</P>
<P>
   ``conspiracy of silence'' and the Bergen Record called
``conspiracy of
</P>
<P>
   hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the press conspiracy discussion was short on clarity
and showed
</P>
<P>
   that, though well-intentioned, American journalists were unable
to deal with
</P>
<P>
   racial motivations that lie deep in the culture; so deep, in
fact, that they
</P>
<P>
   can be expressed spontaneously, without coordination and over an
extended
</P>
<P>
   period of time. Such coverage shows journalists have difficulty
handling
</P>
<P>
   subtle events and reporting on complex social events without
jumping to sudden
</P>
<P>
   conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Although current reports from the Church Arson Task Force reveal
the Black
</P>
<P>
   church fires have greatly declined, Assistant Attorney General
Patrick says
</P>
<P>
   investigations of the arson cases and vigorous pursuit of the
arsonists
</P>
<P>
   continue. But it may be blissful that national news headlines on
the fires
</P>
<P>
   have ceased. For although press perspectives on the rates,
arrests and
</P>
<P>
   deep-seated and complex racial motivations behind the arsons are
warranted,
</P>
<P>
   what is not are poorly explained ideas and speculation of a
national
</P>
<P>
   conspiracy targeting Black churches that may help to incite the
very racism it
</P>
<P>
   seeks to expose.

burnings,
</P>
<P>
   simplistic treatment of a complex story, stereotyping the
arsonists as largely
</P>
<P>
   White racists, and escalating public hysteria by hyping the
story as a return
</P>
<P>
   to the tactics of the segregation era.
</P>
<P>
   Despite critics, at least one press defender addressed the
topic. American
</P>
<P>
   Journalism Review writer Joe Holley noted that over a
seven-month period,
</P>
<P>
   journalists prudently ``connected the dots'' in the fires. They
tended to take
</P>
<P>
   place at Southern Black churches in isolated or rural areas with
most of the
</P>
<P>
   arsonists being White. ``It's an example of how the media can be
distracted,
</P>
<P>
   even misled for a while, but given time, are able to right
themselves, regain
</P>
<P>
   their balance, and tease out the complex truth,'' Holley wrote.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Birmingham Post Herald reporter Ted Bryant
criticized
</P>
<P>
   the press for moving from ``indifference'' to ``hysteria'' and
charged that
</P>
<P>
   reporters inaccurately promoted stereotypes of the arsonists as
White
</P>
<P>
   hate-mongers. Michael Kelly, New Yorker magazine writer, also
noted coverage
</P>
<P>
   problems. He said that at first, reporters paid little attention
to the fires
</P>
<P>
   but later went overboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a case of overreaction that seems to have been inspired in
roughly
</P>
<P>
   equal measure by genuine concern, guilt and self-interests, they
leaped on the
</P>
<P>
   bandwagon with near-hysteria as misplaced as their previous
indifference,''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly wrote. Detroit Free Press religion writer David Crumm also
took the
</P>
<P>
   press to task, charging that reporters ignored motives other
than racism and
</P>
<P>
   ``often relied heavily on stereotypes supporting the idea that a
pack of
</P>
<P>
   church-burning racists could be on the loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, none of these critics addressed the fact that one of the
most
</P>
<P>
   confusing aspects of the reporting was the focus on whether they
were part of
</P>
<P>
   a national conspiracy. Although federal investigators say they
found no
</P>
<P>
   national conspiracy at work (such as KKK or militia groups),
coverage of the
</P>
<P>
   issue was confounding rather than informative. This writer's
research study of
</P>
<P>
   newspaper editorials from the Nexis Lexis database and
Editorials on File
</P>
<P>
   showed that only a third of the 109 editorials published on the
burnings
</P>
<P>
   addressed the conspiracy issue and that what was written was
poorly explained
</P>
<P>
   and highly ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   Making an unclear point
</P>
<P>
   For example, a St. Louis Post Dispatch June 12, 1996, editorial
stated that
</P>
<P>
   church fire investigations ``turned up no interstate
conspiracy'' even though
</P>
<P>
   ``several fires have been linked to people with KKK ties.'' But
the editorial
</P>
<P>
   writer's point about the conspiracy issue was unclear. Because
the KKK has
</P>
<P>
   members in chapters across the nation, why would KKK or Aryan
Nation member
</P>
<P>
   involvement not constitute a local (if not a national)
conspiracy? This
</P>
<P>
   unanswered question should have been addressed to help readers
put facts into
</P>
<P>
   perspective.
</P>
<P>
   In a more radical perspective, Noah Chandler of the Center for
Democratic
</P>
<P>
   Renewal in Atlanta, a civil rights watchdog group, called media
focus on the
</P>
<P>
   conspiracy question ``racist conspiracy itself.'' Other
conspiracy labels also
</P>
<P>
   were noted in the press, including what the Houston Chronicle
called a
</P>
<P>
   ``conspiracy of silence'' and the Bergen Record called
``conspiracy of
</P>
<P>
   hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the press conspiracy discussion was short on clarity
and showed
</P>
<P>
   that, though well-intentioned, American journalists were unable
to deal with
</P>
<P>
   racial motivations that lie deep in the culture; so deep, in
fact, that they
</P>
<P>
   can be expressed spontaneously, without coordination and over an
extended
</P>
<P>
   period of time. Such coverage shows journalists have difficulty
handling
</P>
<P>
   subtle events and reporting on complex social events without
jumping to sudden
</P>
<P>
   conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Although current reports from the Church Arson Task Force reveal
the Black
</P>
<P>
   church fires have greatly declined, Assistant Attorney General
Patrick says
</P>
<P>
   investigations of the arson cases and vigorous pursuit of the
arsonists
</P>
<P>
   continue. But it may be blissful that national news headlines on
the fires
</P>
<P>
   have ceased. For although press perspectives on the rates,
arrests and
</P>
<P>
   deep-seated and complex racial motivations behind the arsons are
warranted,
</P>
<P>
   what is not are poorly explained ideas and speculation of a
national
</P>
<P>
   conspiracy targeting Black churches that may help to incite the
very racism it
</P>
<P>
   seeks to expose.

GOP TRIES TO DELAY VOTE IN THE SENATE ON CHINA BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A majority of Senate Republicans Tuesday urged
their leader, Trent Lott, to delay until September a vote on a
major bill establishing permanent normal trade relations with
China, an approach that Democrats and business leaders said could
imperil the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he had made no decision, and renewed his promise to
try to cut through several procedural and political hurdles and
bring up the measure by the end of this month, before Congress
adjourns for its five-week summer recess.
</P>
<P>
   But in his strongest signal yet that imminent passage of the
China trade bill was in jeopardy, Lott told reporters that waiting
until September ``is not as big a problem as some people fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders and President Clinton have pressed the Senate
to follow the House's lead, and quickly pass a bill that would end
Congress' annual review of China's trade status, before it gets
caught up in election-year politics. In a telephone conversation
Tuesday, Clinton again asked Lott to schedule a vote by month's
end.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill have at least 70 votes, more than enough
to defeat a filibuster. Even so, the final vote has been delayed
since the House passed the measure in May because Lott has given a
higher priority to passing several spending bills. Also
complicating speedy passage is the prospect of several amendments
that could force the measure back to the House for a second vote.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats accused Republicans of postponing action on the
trade bill to extract concessions on spending bills and to allow an
issue that divides Democrats to fester on through the party's
nominating convention in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delay is danger,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat.
``This is putting politics above policy.''
</P>
<P>
   But at their private weekly luncheon Tuesday, several Senate
Republicans recommended that Lott use the remaining two and a half
weeks before the recess to focus on top-priority tax and spending
bills, and set a date in September for the China trade bill vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it makes a difference if we wait until
September,'' said Sen. Rod Grams, a Minnesota Republican who three
weeks ago had urged Lott to hold a vote by July 4. ``We need to
vote on it, but I know we have other priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike supporters in the House, who fought for votes until the
final minutes, backers of the bill in the Senate have always had
the votes to lock up a large victory. But supporters want to
approve a clean version of the House bill, free from amendments
that would force the measure back to the House for a potentially
volatile second vote.
</P>
<P>
   Several senators, including Jesse Helms of North Carolina and
Phil Gramm of Texas, both Republicans, as well as Paul Wellstone, a
Minnesota Democrat, have signaled their intention to offer
amendments on China's record on human rights, religious liberties
and labor conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest hurdle has been a measure sponsored by Sens.
Fred Thompson, a Tennessee Republican, and Robert G. Torricelli, a
New Jersey Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Their measure would require the administration to monitor
China's record on the spread of nuclear weapons. It would impose
automatic sanctions on China if there is ``credible evidence'' of
exports of certain types of prohibited weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would have discretion to waive some penalties, but
others would be automatic. Nonetheless, the administration and
business leaders have opposed the measure as unnecessary, and
harmful to United States diplomacy and American companies that
trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Senate is on record with this harsh rhetoric and these
extraordinarily harmful sanctions, I think it could seriously
poison the well'' with China, said Sen. Tom Daschle of South
Dakota, the Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said he might be able to support the anti-proliferation
measure if significant changes were made, including removing the
bill's focus on China.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Thompson said Tuesday he has dropped sanctions
affecting food and medicine. Republican aides said they were also
modifying other provisions, including the steps that triggered
sanctions, to appease critics.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson has insisted that the Senate vote on his measure before
taking up the China trade bill. He has threatened to offer it as an
amendment if that does not happen.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, process is important, and Lott said he was trying
to work out all the competing parties and proposals. ``The Senate
is going to pass China P.N.T.R.,'' Lott said. ``It's not a question
of `if.' It's a question of when and in what condition.''

UNICEF CITES `KNOWLEDGE GAP'' BETWEEN BOYS AND GIRLS IN
UNDERSTANDING AIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A dangerously large number of young people in
the developing world do not know how to protect themselves from the
virus that causes AIDS, according to a report from Unicef, the U.N.
Children's Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Girls are especially ignorant about the disease, Unicef found. A
survey of 34 countries found that in about half, more than 50
percent of girls from age 15 to 19 said they did not know that a
person with AIDS could appear healthy. In Chad, the figure was 83
percent; in Niger, 81 percent; and in Nepal, 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This knowledge gap is one important element in understanding
the higher HIV infection rate among girls in many countries,'' the
report said. The survey of what young people know about AIDS is
part of Unicef's annual Progress of Nations report, to be published
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach and teach girls are hampered by ``poverty,
local customs, violence and social or religious bias,'' Unicef
said.
</P>
<P>
   But even some knowledge of AIDS and how HIV is transmitted does
not necessarily change young people's perceptions about their
vulnerability or change behavior, the report also found. In Haiti,
Zambia and Zimbabwe _ where risks of being infected are high _ the
Unicef survey found that more than half of sexually active girls
said they did not consider themselves at risk.
</P>
<P>
   One of the greatest challenges to health services, the report
said, ``is how to help young people convert the information they
have about HIV/AIDS into personal awareness of risk.''

 &HT;    Phillip Morris proposes $75 million to compensate Florida
smokers
 &HT;    By George Bennett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Instead of the record-shattering $154 billion punitive
damages penalty proposed by an attorney for sick Florida smokers,
tobacco giant Philip Morris floated a figure about one-thousandth
as large Tuesday in an historic class-action trial.
</P>
<P>
   As closing arguments continued in the two-year-old trial,
tobacco lawyers called the penalty proposed Monday by smokers'
attorney Stanley Rosenblatt a ``death warrant'' that violates
Florida law.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris attorney Dan Webb told jurors that his company,
which owns Marlboro and controls about half the U.S. cigarette
market, should not pay any punitive damages because it has changed
its ways.
</P>
<P>
   But in a nod to jurors who have already ruled twice against the
tobacco industry, Webb suggested several hours into his closing
argument that, if there were to be a punitive damages award, a
``fair amount'' for his client would be $75 million.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt, who represents an estimated 300,000 to 700,000
Floridians with smoking-related illnesses, had suggested a penalty
at least 1,000 times larger for Philip Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt said Philip Morris should pay between $75 billion and
$118 billion and the entire industry should pay between $123
billion and $196.8 billion as punishment for decades of misleading
the public about the hazards of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt said an ``appropriate, just'' penalty for the
industry would be $154 billion _ which is about 30 times more than
the biggest jury award ever in a U.S. product-liability case.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco attorneys fought back Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``His demand for $154 billion or more _ it's not ridiculous.
It's so far beyond what the law and evidence allows that it makes a
mockery of this case,'' Webb told jurors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does nothing more than invite you to become a runaway,
out-of-control jury,'' Webb said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for four other tobacco companies are expected to make
closing arguments today and Thursday in the nation's first smokers'
class-action suit to come before a jury.
</P>
<P>
   Before jurors were seated Tuesday, R.J. Reynolds lawyer Ben Reid
asked Judge Robert Kaye to tell the jury that Rosenblatt's punitive
damage request was illegal because Florida law forbids a verdict
that would bankrupt a company.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco companies say they have a combined value of about
$15 billion, or one-tenth the amount Rosenblatt requested.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye turned down Reid's request, but said attorneys could raise
the issue in their closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Webb did just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That amount is a death warrant because that amount will
destroy each of these companies not once but 10 times over,'' Webb
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you award $6 billion, you've got Philip Morris. It's gone.
It's history. It's out of here,'' Webb said. The company lists its
net worth as $6.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Webb said Philip Morris should not pay any punitive damages
because it has discontinued the practices that jurors found
objectionable in earlier phases of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors who will decide on punitive damages have already
found the tobacco companies guilty of misleading the public about
the addictiveness and deadliness of cigarette smoking. The jury
also awarded $12.7 million to three smokers with cancer who were
deemed to be representatives of the entire class of Floridians with
smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   After spending hours arguing against any award, Webb conceded
late Tuesday that jurors might disagree.
</P>
<P>
   If so, he said, they should base any penalty on Philip Morris'
current assets and liabilities, which yield a balance of about $1.5
billion in cash on hand. Figuring that Florida has about 5 percent
of the nation's smokers, Webb arrived at the $75 million figure
using a felt-tip marker on a tablet of paper on an easel.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a fair amount, if that's what you decide, that
you disagree with Mr. Webb and all my arguments,'' the attorney
said. Philip Morris and other tobacco companies agreed in 1998 to
pay about $250 billion during the next 25 years to the 50 states as
part of a settlement in which the states agreed not to sue the
companies. The agreement also calls for the cigarette makers to
eliminate outdoor advertising, contribute to youth smoking
prevention programs and make other changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement has had a profound effect on Philip Morris and
how it does business,'' said Webb, who said the company is
effectively on ``permanent probation'' under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conduct has changed and therefore the purpose of deterring
our conduct ... has been accomplished,'' Webb said. ``If the Philip
Morris of today has stopped engaging in the misconduct and the men
and women who did it are gone, what is accomplished by punishing
the Philip Morris of today?''

SENATORS WORKING UP TO VOTE   ON REPEAL OF THE ESTATE TAX 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate took a first step Tuesday toward a vote
on a Republican proposal to repeal the federal estate tax, and
Democrats scrambled to avoid defections that could allow passage of
the bill later this week.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which passed the House last month with support
from some Democrats, would gradually eliminate the federal tax on
large estates. Republicans said the tax robs many people at death
of much of any wealth they have accumulated for their heirs, and
hits family-owned farms and small businesses particularly hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that the federal government would reach into the
grave and pull back half of a life's work offends people regardless
of race, sex, region, financial situation or anything else,'' said
Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has signaled that he would veto the estate tax
bill. But mindful that 9 of 45 Democratic senators have endorsed
repeal of the estate tax, Democratic leaders unveiled an
alternative proposal Tuesday that would eliminate the tax for most
family-owned businesses and farms but leave it in place for a
relatively small number of multimillion-dollar estates.
</P>
<P>
   But it was unclear whether Democrats would be able to block the
Republican bill as it confronts a procedural hurdle. To cut off
debate on the bill and bring it to a final vote, the legislation's
sponsors would have to muster 60 votes, meaning that Republicans
would have to be joined by at least five Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The nine Democrats who support estate tax repeal sent a letter
to Lott urging him to allow consideration of the Democratic
alternative as well as other Democratic amendments.
</P>
<P>
   So far Lott and his Democratic counterpart, Thomas Daschle of
South Dakota, have been unable to agree on what measures should be
considered, and if there is no agreement that Lott could force a
vote on cutting off debate later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said he is confident that all 45 Democrats will stick
together to block a final vote on the bill if Republicans do not
allow them to vote on the amendments they want to offer. But Lott
said that if he can find a way to have a final vote, the bill would
win support from as many as 70 senators.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican bill would decrease federal revenues by $104
billion over the first 10 years, and $750 billion in its second
decade. Democrats said their alternative would reduce revenues by
$64 billion over the first 10 years and $300 billion over the
second decade.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said that by insisting on full repeal of the tax,
Republicans were intent on handing over a huge chunk of projected
federal budget surpluses to the rich while doing nothing to address
issues of concern to working people who do not have the luxury of
worrying about multimillion-dollar estates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we want to provide meaningful estate tax reform?'' Daschle
said. ``Of course. But do we really want to give those
multibillionaires the opportunity to pass on estates absolutely tax
free?
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, estates valued at up to $675,000 are exempt
from federal taxation, and the exemption is scheduled to rise to $1
million in 2006. Family-owned businesses and farms are exempt up to
$1.3 million. Above those levels, estates are subject to a
graduated tax with a top rate of 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has become politically potent as the 76 million
members of the baby boom generation, their wealth swollen by the
strong economy and stock market, have begun estate planning.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: VIRGIN ATLANTIC ENABLES IN-FLIGHT USE OF CELL

   Mayday! Mayday!
</P>
<P>
   Far sooner than anyone had anticipated, the cell phone call has
breached a technological wall and invaded what was literally the
last place beyond its reach: the passenger compartment of an
in-flight airliner.
</P>
<P>
   OK, now that the alarm has been sounded, let's calm down and
assess this startling news for its potentially beneficial portent.
After all, many business travelers depend on cell phones. And maybe
the small percentage of cell phone users who drive the rest of us
crazy will learn some manners as the strong reaction builds against
cellular rudeness.
</P>
<P>
   Virgin Atlantic Airways is the innovator (or perpetrator) of
this new development. Virgin says that it has become ``the first
airline to allow passengers to receive calls via their mobile phone
number while in flight,'' using a new technology that routes
incoming cellular calls to handsets at passengers' seats.
</P>
<P>
   But this doesn't mean that cabins are suddenly going to be
inundated with bellowing cell phoners adding a new ring of torture
to those cramped aircraft spaces. In fact, Virgin's new service,
which is named Earth Calling, is currently available on only one
airplane, a Boeing 747 that inaugurated the carrier's new direct
service between London and New Delhi last week. And the service
only works on cell phones using advanced GSM-type wireless service
that is standard in Europe but not yet common in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We launched it on just the one aircraft, but we have an
aggressive retrofit plan'' to modify the entire fleet to
accommodate the technology, said David Tharp, the director of
in-flight entertainment for Virgin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be disruptive to other passengers,'' said Sharon
Pomerantz, a spokeswoman for Virgin. ``There won't be phones
ringing all over the plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, incoming calls ring quietly on passenger earphones or
are announced in a text on in-seat video screens. To take a call,
``you actually use the existing handset built into each seat,''
Tharp said. The cell phone itself remains off.
</P>
<P>
   The system was developed by British Telecommunications under the
brand name Mobile Connect. Basically, it takes a ground call and
sends it to a satellite, where it is then beamed to an individual's
cell phone number on the plane, where ``the handset acts as your
mobile phone,'' Tharp said.
</P>
<P>
   To receive calls, a passenger must first obtain a user card from
her GSM service provider. The card is swiped through an armrest
scanner that programs the system to retrieve calls coming in on the
passenger's usual cell phone number. Per-call costs ``will not
greatly exceed'' those now in place for international GSM roaming,
said British Telecommunications, which added that about 80 percent
of European business travelers carry GSM phones. In the United
States, only a fraction of cellular customers have GSM service.
</P>
<P>
   The in-seat handsets also can be used to make calls, though this
is nothing new. Most airlines offer this service under brand names
like GTE Airfone and British Telecom Skyphone. But the new system
allows passengers for the first time to bill air-to-ground calls
through their cellular provider, Tharp said.
</P>
<P>
   The new system circumvents worldwide prohibitions against using
standard cell phones on in-flight aircraft because of some concerns
that they could interfere with aircraft navigation systems.
</P>
<P>
   The prohibition, which is enforced on aircraft by the Federal
Aviation Administration, was instituted by the Federal
Communications Commission in landmark 1981 regulations that
reallocated certain radio frequencies to encourage growth and
competition in the fledgling cellular industry.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about the potential for interference were important
factors in the cell phone prohibition, said William F. Adler, a
former chief of the FCC mobile services division who helped to
draft the regulations. But the main thrust of the regulations was
to divide up the cellular broadcast band in a way that let
competing cellular providers in nonadjacent areas across the
country use the same frequencies without overlapping signals, said
Adler, who is now general counsel at Globalstar, a provider of
mobile and satellite telephone services based in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The same frequencies can be used simultaneously in different
areas because a cell phone signal from the ground does not wander
much beyond its intended receiving station. But from an airplane
six miles high, cell phone signals reach the earth in a wide cone
that covers a big chunk of geography.
</P>
<P>
   ``The radio traffic-management system gets completely
undermined,'' Adler said. ``Potentially, with cellular calls from
airplanes, you'd have dozens and dozens of base stations receiving
your signal and getting confused.'' Among other things, billing for
calls would become chaotic.
</P>
<P>
   On-board cellular-call service, which British Telecommunications
is now marketing to other airlines besides Virgin, is just the most
recent technological leap in a rapidly changing new era in which
airline passengers will ultimately have not only personal cell
phone service but also e-mail and broadband Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   But technology does not address the problem of bad cell phone
manners. Adler speculated that Americans in general are less
accustomed than Europeans to ambient public noise and therefore
more likely to speak unnecessarily loudly into a cell phone. He
says the cellular industry should consider mounting a publicity
campaign to promote the simple idea that it is not necessary to
bellow into a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Pomerantz at Virgin, meanwhile, has faith that on-board cellular
calls will not become just one more annoyance in air travel.
``Hopefully, people won't be shouting on the phones,'' she said.
``You have to assume that your passengers are polite.'' &QL;

BUSINESS TRAVEL: VIRGIN ATLANTIC ENABLES IN-FLIGHT USE OF CELL
PHONES 
</HEADLINE>
   (duplication warning: also sent with `t' code)

<P>
   Mayday! Mayday!
</P>
<P>
   Far sooner than anyone had anticipated, the cell phone call has
breached a technological wall and invaded what was literally the
last place beyond its reach: the passenger compartment of an
in-flight airliner.
</P>
<P>
   OK, now that the alarm has been sounded, let's calm down and
assess this startling news for its potentially beneficial portent.
After all, many business travelers depend on cell phones. And maybe
the small percentage of cell phone users who drive the rest of us
crazy will learn some manners as the strong reaction builds against
cellular rudeness.
</P>
<P>
   Virgin Atlantic Airways is the innovator (or perpetrator) of

SIX YEARS AFTER BIG QUAKE, NORTHRIDGE MALL RUNNING STRONG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAM PARK 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Northridge Fashion Center may have been shaken
in the 1994 earthquake, but now it's doing some moving and shaking
of its own.
</P>
<P>
   As of May, year-to-date sales were up 30 percent and customer
counts were up 35 percent at the San Fernando Valley mall, less
than a mile from the epicenter of the magnitude-6.7 earthquake that
struck Jan. 17, 1994. Mall sales were $380 per square-foot, said
Carol Jacobs, general manager. The industry average right now is in
the low-300s, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to see monthly increases,''she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs attributed the strong sales numbers to a reconfiguration
of the north end of the mall as an entertainment, dining and
shopping area, attracting good tenants and promoting ``family
friendly'' events such as the Farmers Market and Family Festival
and the Kids Club.
</P>
<P>
   New tenants including Banana Republic and A Bear is Born have
been added this year, and several more restaurants and retailers
are scheduled to open in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipated July openings:
</P>
<P>
   --Gloria Jean's Coffee, a seller of gourmet coffee and specialty
drinks.
</P>
<P>
   --Beyond The Beach, catering to the younger set with trendy
casual clothes, sunglasses and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipated November-December openings:
</P>
<P>
   --The Sushi Factory, with an all-you-can eat buffet, Japanese
entrees, sushi, salads and desserts.
</P>
<P>
   --Wood Ranch BBQ &AMP; Grill, with Certified Angus Beef steaks and
more.
</P>
<P>
   --Cost Plus World Market, specializing in gifts and housewares
from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   New tenants are good news, but huge sales increases for existing
tenants such as The Gap, Eddie Bauer and Guess? stores are also
bumping up the total sales for the Fashion Center, Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   The Farmers Market and Family Festival, held Wednesdays from 5
p.m. to 9 p.m., draws a crowd of up to 5,000 people each week, and
some of them apparently come inside the mall to shop. Mall sales
jump 10 percent on Wednesdays.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't just coming to the market. It has been
incredible for us,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   The Farmers Market and Family Festival features food products,
but also offers activities for children and booths for community
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The Fashion Center also offers the Kids Club at 10 a.m. on the
first and third Thursdays of each month. Some 400 to 500 children
and parents come out for activities such as book readings and
magicians, Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done a lot to make the center family-friendly,'' Jacobs
said.
</P>
<P>
   Customers can come to the Fashion Center for some serious
shopping, entertainment, several choices of affordable, sit-down
dining, or a combination of the three. That's part of its success,
Jacob said.

HOSPITAL BANS DELIVERY ROOM VIDEOS AFTER MALPRACTICE SUIT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LISA TEACHEY 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the late 1970s when childbirth returned to a more natural
procedure and a family event, videotaping soon followed as delivery
room routine.
</P>
<P>
   But with hospitals fearing lawsuits, that may change.
</P>
<P>
   A Houston hospital has banned videotaping of births after
recently agreeing to pay a family $15 million. The family's tape
showed negligence during the delivery that left the child blind and
with irreversible brain damage. The name of the hospital was not
disclosed as part of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by the Houston Chronicle found three local hospitals
with no-taping policies _ Christus St. Joseph Hospital, Doctor's
Hospital-Parkway and Doctor's Hospital-Tidwell. Christus St. Joseph
ranks among the top four Houston hospitals in number of deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators would not comment about the rule, but legal and
medical experts say fear of lawsuits is driving such policies
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of a trend over the last two to three years
prompted by medical journals,'' said Mary Anne Bobinski, associate
dean for academic affairs at the University of Houston Law Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly a $15 million settlement might cause hospitals and
doctors to take one more look at it,'' Bobinski said.
</P>
<P>
   The June 25 settlement is one of the largest on record for
medical malpractice involving an infant, said Richard Mithoff, the
attorney representing the family.
</P>
<P>
   An informal poll Mithoff conducted found many more Houston
hospitals may ban videocameras in delivery rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been told by hospital representatives they intend to
prohibit videotaping in the future and that prohibition is a result
of cases just like this,'' Mithoff said. ``And what is so troubling
about all of this is that from the hospital's perspective, as I see
it, this is just one more effort to keep the secrecy lid on.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 15, 1999, the sister and mother of the pregnant woman
accompanied her to the hospital. The sister kept the camera on in
the delivery room, Mithoff said. The lack of medical attention by
the nurse was documented on the tape.
</P>
<P>
   After the baby was born, she made no sounds and showed no signs
of muscle movement.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of giving the newborn oxygen, the attending nurse
verbally coaxed the child, Mithoff said. The nurse waited almost an
hour before calling a doctor. Experts in the case said lack of
oxygen injured the baby.
</P>
<P>
   Mithoff said the new mother's cries can be heard on the
videotape. Toward the end, a medical attendant can be heard saying,
``Someone better get that tape and destroy it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This family would not have known everything that happened but
for this videotape,'' Mithoff said. ``The video captured this
nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Zurawin, president of the Houston Gynecological and
Obstetrical Society, said a patient's request to videotape
childbirths presents doctors with a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to satisfy our patient's wishes. They want to record
it because this is an exciting event,'' Zurawin said. ``But the
conflict is it's a permanent record.''
</P>
<P>
   Most deliveries are without incident, Zurawin said. But if
something does go wrong, the videotape is an instant legal
document.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all bad outcomes are the result of malpractice,'' Zurawin
said. ``But doctors are concerned it can be used against them. . .
. Unfortunately in today's legal climate, if anything goes wrong
with anything you get sued. . . . Right or wrong, like it or not,
doctors are understandably not eager to have evidence that can be
used against them.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a national movement in the late 1970s to make delivery
rooms less surgical-like, childbirth is a medical procedure,
Zurawin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this happened around the time personal videocameras
first came out,'' Zurawin said. ``And the process of birth became
social. But you wouldn't videotape a coronary artery bypass. When a
woman goes to have a Pap smear, her husband doesn't videotape
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some argue videotapes can exonerate doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's the best evidence there was no wrongdoing,''
said Harold Freeman, associate director of legislative affairs of
the Texas Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Perdue Sr., a medical malpractice legal expert, said if
doctors handle the situation correctly they should not care which
parts of the process are taped.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do they have to hide?'' Perdue asked. ``If the idea is
`Well, it's just too gory,' we know that isn't true because you can
turn on the Discovery Channel and watch births all the time. You
can watch them on the Internet.''

 &HT;    Cultivating an interest in Herbs
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We're going to try to set the world record right here in Austin
for packing the most number of guys named Herb into an herb bar.
</P>
<P>
   I'll admit that I don't know what the world record for the most
number of Herbs in an herb joint is, because, frankly, this is such
a silly idea that I doubt it has ever been attempted.
</P>
<P>
   This all began when my boss and I were driving by The Herb Bar
at 200 W. Mary St., where you can find tarot card readings, herbal
tinctures and essential oils, and I'm not talking about Quaker
State. As we drove past, my boss made a comment about how funny it
would be to invite all the guys named Herb to gather at The Herb
Bar at some later date, hold a celebration of Herbs, and take a
group picture of all the Herbs.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a Herb, and you want to be member of the International
Order of Herbs, and you would like to be in the group photo, just
give me a holler at the e-mail address listed at the bottom of this
column, and later we'll get together at The Herb Bar.
</P>
<P>
   I have spoken with Twila Dawn Willis, owner of The Herb Bar,
which doesn't really have a bar but does have herbs, though it has
no Herbs. She thinks this is a great idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know any Herbs, so now I'll get to meet some,'' said
Willis, who doesn't have anyone named Rosemary working for her. She
said the name of her business sometimes throws people off. ``Uh, I
do have people who come in and think it's an actual bar,'' she
said. ``They think they can get a drink here. I just send 'em to
Trophy's.''
</P>
<P>
   I hope to get Herb Kelleher, chief executive of Southwest
Airlines, to show up. In fact, on Monday I called his office in
Dallas to invite him. ``He would need something in writing, but his
calendar is booked for the year,'' said Vickie Shuler, his
executive assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I should mail Herb Kelleher a bottle of Wild Turkey. I
hear he likes that.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, you can get a drink at The Herb Bar. On Monday morning
when I visited, they had a jug of Dandy Blend instant dandelion
beverage set up on a bar in the back room. I don't think that's
going to interest Herb Kelleher much, though. I don't blame him. My
idea of a good time isn't drinking weeds.
</P>
<P>
   You know, there sure is a shortage of Herbs these days. ``It's
not in fashion anymore,'' Willis said, speaking of Herb, not herb.
``Things come and go. I had an aunt named Mabel, and you don't hear
of anyone named Mabel.'' I bet there's a Mabel at the Buda truck
stop.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, it really is hard to name many famous Herbs. Other
than Kelleher, you've got '50s Hoosier humorist Herb Shriner,
trumpeter Herb Alpert, pro football Hall of Famer Herb Adderley and
late newspaper columnist Herb Caen.
</P>
<P>
   President Herbert Hoover could have been a Herb, but they called
him Herbert. If it had been him instead of George Bush who had
blown beets on that guy in Japan, they would have called him
Herbert Heaver, but that's another matter altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, if you're a Herb and you want to become a member of
the International Order of Herbs, give me a shout. And if Rosemary
wants to join us, she's welcome if she's got the thyme.

ENDORSEMENTS AND DEBATES WERE SIGNIFICANT, POLLING PROJECT FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.H., Iowa)   By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Endorsements and debates played critical roles in
this year's contests for presidential nominations, according to
findings of a huge polling project conducted by the Annenberg
Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Nightly tracking polls of voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, for
example, showed that Vice President Al Gore's Jan. 5 debate attack
on Bill Bradley over health care and his Jan. 8 blast over a
Bradley vote on flood relief had a distinct effect on Democratic
voters, and halted the former New Jersey senator's momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``In two debates, Bradley effectively lost the nomination,''
said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg center.
</P>
<P>
   Endorsements cut both ways, Jamieson said. For example, the
endorsement of Gov. George W. Bush by the National Right to Life
Committee won him votes from abortion opponents in his race against
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., but cost him votes among Republican
supporters of abortion rights. That endorsement, she said, ``may
have misled people into thinking McCain was more pro-choice than he
actually was.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamieson described the value of endorsements as a shortcut for
voters ``seeking information about candidate stands.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to deriving impact from endorsements, she said, was
usually to advertise them. In Iowa, for example, only 19 percent of
Democrats were aware of the endorsement of Bradley by Sen. Paul
Wellstone of neighboring Minnesota, who campaigned frequently with
him. But 75 percent knew that one of their senators, Tom Harkin,
had endorsed Gore. The Harkin support was shown often in Gore
advertisements on radio and television. The Wellstone endorsement
was not shown at all. Instead, Bradley's campaign used an
advertisement showing that he was being backed by Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Another important finding was that knowing the source of a
political advertisement can be critical to its effectiveness.
Jamieson found that a Bush radio advertisement accusing McCain of
opposing spending for cancer research was widely known across the
country and had a big impact on female voters, although it was
broadcast only in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Those who knew that the Bush campaign had sponsored the
advertisement were 11 percentage points less likely to believe it
than those who did not, Jamieson said. If it had been sponsored by
a group calling itself Citizens for Breast Cancer Research, for
instance, it might have been even more effective, she said.
</P>
<P>
   These findings are among the first from a polling effort that
began last December and will end only next January, after more than
100,000 interviews on Americans' political opinions, knowledge and
use of media.

 &HT;    Age notions getting old
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the same time that Congress is arguing over providing health
care for elderly Americans, old folks are complaining that they are
not old.
</P>
<P>
   A peppery friend of my mother gets upset when the ``press,''
which is me, refers to someone her age as elderly, old or senior.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't dare ask, but the woman must be in her 70s, maybe her
80s. She is healthy and sharp, and evidently feels like she is in
her 20s.
</P>
<P>
   I can't pin her down on her definition of elderly, old or
senior. It's a moving target. That enables her to avoid being
called old.
</P>
<P>
   If, as the saying goes, we are as old as we feel, she may have a
point.
</P>
<P>
   People definitely are living longer. If they take care of
themselves, people in their 60s today can be as vigorous as people
in their 40s were a century ago, perhaps only a few generations
ago.
</P>
<P>
   A British study estimates that the retirement age will rise to
80 in the next 25 years as life expectancy continues to increase.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 million Americans are members of AARP, a nonprofit
association ``dedicated to shaping and enriching the experience of
aging for our members and for all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   This group, which was founded in 1958, accepts members at the
age of 50. Is 50 old? If so, we will elect an old president in
November. Both Al Gore and George W. Bush are over 50.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the commentary that accompanied the announcement of the
mapping of the human genome included musings about how this
information will be used to extend life.
</P>
<P>
   Medical researchers have claimed that it is reasonable to assume
that normal life expectancy can be doubled when scientists learn to
take advantage of a person's genetic code.
</P>
<P>
   If that's true, my mother's friend, fast-forwarded into the
genetic future, could be 160 and still complaining about the
``press'' referring to someone her age as old.
</P>
<P>
   If people continue to live longer, stay healthy and retire
later, why should they automatically qualify for government
benefits when they hit 62 for Social Security or 65 for Medicare?
</P>
<P>
   Heck, at 65 people in the near future would be somewhere between
young adults and middle aged, according to some of the experts
quoted when the human genome announcement was made.
</P>
<P>
   It would make no sense to pay Social Security to people who are
still capable of playing major league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   If Nolan Ryan could throw heat in the majors at 46, then his
great-grandson might be able to do the same at 92. At that point,
it certainly wouldn't be right for people to be drawing Social
Security or Medicare, much less all those senior citizen discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are people who are spry and vigorous at 80 while
other people at 60 are feeble and barely hanging on.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps chronological age should be dropped as the measurement
to determine how old a person is. Some sort of new measurement
needs to be developed that can gauge a person's mental and physical
abilities. A calendar certainly can't do that.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure there are octogenarians today who are superior drivers
compared to many motorists in their teens and 20s. When it comes to
issuing driver's licenses, there is no need to single out any
group, young or old.
</P>
<P>
   Test them all with the same test. Weed them out based on the
ability _ or inability _ to drive.
</P>
<P>
   Testing people to determine their eligibility to draw benefits
designed to help elderly Americans cope with old age will be more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   But if the retirement age rises to 80 in the next 25 years, the
country will need a new definition of old.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For years, Southern California has been engaged in
an epic pollution battle, the struggle to get rid of the brown
smoggy haze that hangs over the skyline on a hot summer day.
</P>
<P>
   Now the region is caught in another struggle that will provide a
new test of its political will and the social conscience of its
residents: rethinking a system that dumps nearly a trillion gallons
of polluted urban runoff each year into the ocean alongside some of
Southern California's most fabled beaches.
</P>
<P>
   In the dry summer months, Southern California's beaches are
considered among the cleanest in the nation, with pollution
concentrated near storm drain outlets and in the protected coves
preferred by mothers and their children.
</P>
<P>
   But during winter rains, the region's entire coast suffers.
Beaches that attract some 50 million visitors annually become
off-limits as storm drainage races to the ocean bringing with it
the waste of everyday life, everything from cigarette butts to oil,
lawn fertilizer, human waste and animal feces.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome here is expected to be a test for the rest of the
nation. The pollution of coastal waters has reached a crucial stage
virtually everywhere, with beach closures last year reported from
Huntington Beach, Calif., to Key West, Fla., to Southern New
England.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the pollution caused by runoff in Southern
California is not a new problem. Indeed, it is a function of the
way the region developed its storm system, a network of concrete
waterways designed to avert flooding by directing runoff to the
ocean.
</P>
<P>
   But rampant development and increased water testing revealing
the extent of the problem and the related health risks are raising
the level of debate among environmental advocates, state and local
officials and even the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Experts predict that solving the problem will cost billions of
dollars and will rival the efforts to control smog.
</P>
<P>
   With pressure for a solution mounting, Congress is considering
legislation that would require water testing and the posting of
unsafe conditions at beaches nationwide. The Environmental
Protection Agency has already established minimum quality standards
for recreational waters and has developed a program, still in its
infancy, to give the public access to water-quality information. In
California, Gov. Gray Davis recently provided an additional $5
million for jobs to help enforce regulations regarding discharges
and polluted runoff, while public awareness campaigns are urging
residents to think twice before pouring something down their
gutters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need more than anything else is a real sea change of
people's understanding of the problem,'' said David Beckman, senior
attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council in Southern
California. ``It's about the environment and public health, and if
you don't care about those two things, it's about your wallet.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckman likens storm drains to ``bazookas pointed at the ocean''
bombarding swimmers and surfers with the bacteria and other
pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   In the region stretching from Ventura to the Mexican border, the
volume of runoff grew to nearly a trillion gallons annually in 1995
from 65 billion gallons a year in 1972, according to the Southern
California Coastal Water Research Project, a consortium of
sanitation districts and regulators.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 study by the University of Southern California and the
Santa Monica Bay Restoration Project found that people who swam
near a storm drain were 50 to 150 percent more likely to report
symptoms like fever, diarrhea, nausea and upper respiratory
ailments than persons swimming farther away.
</P>
<P>
   But as the problem worsens, environmental groups say government
agencies are not enforcing regulations that would limit it. The
resources defense council, an nonprofit environmental group, has
petitioned the EPA to force the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality
Control Board to enforce regulations regarding discharges or be
removed from its role as overseer.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clean Water Act requires big cities, large industrial
entities and large construction sites to comply with storm water
regulations, but noncompliance is rampant,'' Beckman said.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis Strauss, the EPA's director of the water division for the
Western states and 140 American Indian tribes, said the governor's
approval of $5 million for the hiring of additional manpower for
the water quality boards would probably help resolve the defense
council's concerns in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Of the 150 employees on the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality
Control Board, 7 work in the storm water program, overseeing some
3,500 industrial operations, 96 cities and 2 counties plus
construction sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have taken every effort to deal with storm water pollution
commensurate with our capability,'' said Dennis Dickerson,
executive officer for the control board.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson noted that the board established measures to limit
litter discharge and has increased its efforts to enforce municipal
permits on runoff levels. In January, the board approved stricter
standards that would force builders to install abatement measures
in many commercial projects.
</P>
<P>
   But the new standards are being challenged by a number of cities
along with builders and oil companies.

MARYLAND OPENS FILM OFFICE, BUT TELLS HOLLYWOOD IT'S NOT POACHING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSE HIESTAND 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ By opening a film office in Los Angeles this
month, Maryland has joined a growing list of states and countries
setting up shop in Hollywood's back yard to woo away production
business.
</P>
<P>
   The move by the Maryland Film Office comes in the wake of a
recent report that ``runaway production'' is picking up pace, with
the number of major features shot in California dropping 33 percent
in 1999 over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   But veteran Los Angeles film location manager Ken Haber, who
will promote the Free State from a small office in Benedict Canyon,
said Maryland seeks to complement, not compete with, California by
offering unique locales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maryland has virtually all of the looks of the East Coast,
from New England down through the South and even the Midwest,''
Haber said. ``None of these are things that would affect films that
need to be shot in L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Chesapeake Bay, some 5,000 miles of coastline and lush
forests are not enough of a draw, the state has waived its 5
percent sales tax for any production-related services or purchases,
said Michael B. Styer, director of the Maryland Film Office, an
agency of the state's Department of Business and Economic
Development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to take away work from Southern California,''
Styer said. ``A certain number of films, because of the types of
locations they need, don't have a California look.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Los Angeles officials see little threat from
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can match our looks, the weather, our locations and our
crews,'' said Morrie Goldman, spokesman for the Los Angeles County
Entertainment Industry Development Corp., which grants permits for
television and film productions on Los Angeles city and county
land. ``From a marketing perspective, it makes sense for them to be
here. They're not the first and won't be the last.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida and Virginia already have offices in Los Angeles,
joining England and other countries that either have full-time film
offices here or rely on their tourism promoters.
</P>
<P>
   Canada has lured away a lion's share of the runaway production
through favorable currency exchange rates and by offering rebates
and other financial incentives to producers who work there and hire
its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   That helped contributed to a 10 percent decline in feature films
made in the U.S. last year over 1998 figures, according to a report
last month by the film industry think tank ECO2000.
</P>
<P>
   Feature film and television production in Maryland has grown
steadily in the past few years, reaching record levels in fiscal
year 2000 by adding an estimated $77 million to the state's
economy, according to its film office.
</P>
<P>
   Features shot there either entirely or in part in the past year
include ``The Replacements,'' starring Keanu Reeves and Gene
Hackman, and ``Blair Witch II,'' the sequel to the highly
successful independent horror film set in the Maryland woods.
</P>
<P>
   The state was also used exclusively to shoot the new Warner
Bros. television series ``Young Americans,'' set to debut Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland officials hope their Los Angeles office, opened July 1,
will give them better access to Hollywood's decision makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to know about things earlier in the game that we
wouldn't otherwise know over here on the East Coast,'' Styer said.
</P>
<P>
   In his 10-year career, Haber has worked with directors Oliver
Stone, Rob Reiner, Frances Ford Coppola and Clint Eastwood and
served as location manager on such feature films as ``Thelma and
Louise,'' ``The Thin Red Line,'' ``Fatal Attraction'' and ``The
Bridges of Madison County.''
</P>
<P>
   While not alarmed by the outsiders' moves, the California Film
Commission has launched its own counteroffensive through a
state-funded program to reimburse filmmakers for the cost of having
local, state or federal employees monitor filming.
</P>
<P>
   ``California has stepped up its efforts to make the state even
more attractive to filmmakers,'' said Karen Constine, director of
the film commission. ``We have so many locations to choose for
filmmakers that everything they're looking for can be found here.''

 LOS ANGELES: oil companies.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Montevideo, who is representing 32 of the 33 cities in
Los Angeles County that have challenged the regulations, said they
were poorly written, not well researched and might hold unknown
dangers for the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations require new development projects to filter or
treat the first three-quarters of an inch of runoff in a 24-hour
period. The standard is written to include projects like commercial
developments of more than 100,000 square feet, gasoline stations,
auto repair shops and developments of more than 10 houses. But,
Montevideo said, the wording would also seem to make the
regulations apply to some homeowners _ specifically those on
hillsides or those living in environmentally sensitive areas _ if
they make improvements.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the new regulations would hamper the development of
low-to-moderate income housing.
</P>
<P>
   Montevideo, who also represents building-industry groups, wants
the state water board to consider a less restrictive program.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, Santa Monica and West Hollywood have all endorsed
the new standards, and several innovative projects to address the
problem are in place, in the works or near completion. For example,
Los Angeles County has established diversions affecting five drains
where highly polluted runoff is a problem. During dry weather the
runoff is first channeled into sewage treatment plants.
</P>
<P>
   The county is also using nets and other barriers to collect
trash that flows into drains and has spent $5 million in the last
four years to educate residents about how they can help eliminate
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Monica projects include a $10 million recycling plant
that will treat the water and then pump it for use irrigating parks
and street medians.
</P>
<P>
   While such project provide alternatives in dry weather, the
solution for handling runoff in wet weather remains elusive.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of the debate, the Los Angeles region is a
ground zero for the runoff issue, which exists nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing the effects of runoff pollution at beaches all
across the country,'' said Kelli McGee, coastal programs counsel
with the American Oceans Campaign, which is dedicated to preserving
oceans and coastal habitat. Quantifying the problem, McGee said, is
difficult because only 10 states have monitoring programs.
</P>
<P>
   The House has passed a bill that would require states with
coastal waters used for recreation to establish minimum standards
for water quality, monitor them and post when levels exceed safe
levels. A similar bill is working its way through the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The federal legislation is modeled after a California bill
passed in 1997 that required testing of water for bacteria at
beaches with 50,000 visitors a year between April and October and
required warnings when bacteria reached a certain level.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles region is problematic because storm water
systems are separate from sewage systems. This is to prevent the
torrential rains, which typically occur during the winter, from
overwhelming sewage treatment systems
</P>
<P>
   In the Los Angeles area, with some 10 million residents living
in what amounts to a concrete bowl that slopes toward the ocean,
rainfall is directed into paved rivers and creeks that force the
water to the ocean. But along with that water comes every piece of
garbage and a variety of pollutants left behind on streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``That, in a nutshell, is the problem,'' Beckman said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The pollution problem is most prevalent in the winter when rains
are heaviest. That fact is best illustrated by the annual report
done by Heal the Bay, which for 10 years has issued a review of
water quality at the beaches. Of the 263 beaches reviewed this
year, 174 or 66 percent received an A, for excellent water quality
in dry weather. In wet weather, that figured dropped significantly,
with only 25 percent of the beaches receiving an A or a B for
excellent to good water quality during weather.
</P>
<P>
   Although the problem is worse during the winter months, it still
occurs during the summer. Much of Huntington Beach was closed to
swimming from July 1 through Labor Day last year because of high
bacteria counts. The cause is still unknown, but investigators have
zeroed in on runoff.
</P>
<P>
   And beaches geared for children, many of which are near storm
drains and in calmer waters, tend to be a problem year-round.
Mother's Beach in Marina del Rey, for example, is routinely
declared unfit for swimming.
</P>
<P>
   While strides are being made to divert or treat runoff during
the summer, solutions are nonexistent for the winter months.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Moore, a surfer for more than 40 years who operates a
boat for microbiological testing, is aware of what lurks in the
waters. But he does not always heed the warnings. Recently, Moore
got a painful lesion that he believes was the result of surfing in
contaminated waters at Seal Beach in Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   Moore and four companions all got sore throats. A boil developed
on Moore's forearm, which had to be treated with antibiotics. The
problem worsened until he had to be hospitalized for treatment of a
streptococcus infection, which he said doctors diagnosed as a form
of flesh- eating virus.
</P>
<P>
   While no one can be certain whether the infection was related to
surfing in polluted waters, Moore _ who has surfed in the area for
42 years _ believes it was and will not take chances again.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I have to do after this enormous trauma is stay very wary
and very concerned about discharges,'' he said. ``It hurts because
this is my home. This is my roots, my ocean, my bay, my river
mouth. Now that's been taken away.''

_ some would say unsustainable _ heights after they announce, or
even hint, that they have a fiber optics product, division or
customer.  &UR; COLUMN BY KATHLEEN PENDER &LR;

YAHOO REPORTS STRONG EARNINGS DESPITE FEARS OF
ADVERTISING  SLOWDOWN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By VERNE KOPYTOFF 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Yahoo Inc. reported higher-than-expected
earnings yesterday amid concerns that the Internet portal
industry's growth is slowing because of declining online
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Clara, Calif., Web portal company said it earned $65.5
million (12 cents per share) in the second quarter, compared with
$27 million (5 cents) in the year-ago period. The firm's revenue
more than doubled from the same period last year, rising to $270.1
million from $128.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's earnings, which beat Wall Street's expectations by 2
cents a share, were being watched closely by financial analysts as
a bellwether for other Web portals. Over the past month, several
analysts have questioned whether portal companies like Yahoo could
continue rapid growth given that many of their dot-com advertisers
were wounded by the stock market slide this spring.
</P>
<P>
   But Yahoo's earnings seem to have dispelled some of those fears.
The company said that fewer than 10 percent of its advertisers are
in financial trouble and that its advertising sales to more stable
brick-and-mortar companies is strong.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the company's increased revenue was attributed to a
growing number of users and overseas expansion. It also added 800
online merchants during the quarter for a total of 11,300.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yahoo blew away the revenue number, basically addressing
concerns about the dot-com slowdown,'' said Bob Walberg, an analyst
for Briefing.com, an online investor advisory service. ``I think
this is very good news for Yahoo.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo, the third-most-popular Web portal, is especially
vulnerable to fluctuating marketing budgets because nearly 80
percent of its revenue comes from advertising. A study by Lehman
Bros., the New York investment bank, found that 63 percent of
Yahoo's top 200 advertisers are dot-coms, many of which have been
suffering in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts cautioned that Yahoo's strong earnings does not
necessarily mean that all Internet portals are safe. They said that
Yahoo and Amercia Online have such big audiences that most
companies feel compelled to advertise on them.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the case with less-popular Internet portals like
Lycos, AltaVista and Goto.com, analysts said. For example, NBC
Internet, the San Francisco online arm of General Electric, said in
June that its earnings would be lower than expected for the rest of
the year, partly because of a slowdown in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second- and third-tier portals run the risk of being
squeezed,'' said Michele Slack, an analyst for Jupiter
Communications, the market research company.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that many dot-com advertisers have gone
out of business or laid off large portions of their staffs in
recent months. Among them are Toysmart.com, the online retailer,
and Reel.com, the movie video retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Others have seen their stocks plunge, delayed initial public
offerings and tried to reduce expenses. For example, Drkoop.com,
the troubled medical Web site, renegotiated its multimillion-dollar
partnership with America Online.
</P>
<P>
   In reaction to the online advertising slump, many portals are
trying to diversify. Some are trying to recruit more traditional
advertisers like Coca-Cola and Procter &AMP; Gamble, though most
analysts doubt that this can offset all the losses.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo is making additional efforts. Last month, it began selling
a customized version of its Internet portal to corporate clients.
It also recently bought Egroups, the online community e-mail site
in San Francisco, which allows for more economical advertising
because people can be targeted based on their interests.
</P>
<P>
   Fears about slower growth have pushed Yahoo's stock down
significantly in recent weeks. The stock, which rose as high as
$250 in January, ended the day yesterday at $105.50. In after-hours
trading, the company's shares surged as high as $121.

 PAY-TO-SURF NOT PAYING OFF FOR WEB SITES  &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Just months ago, paying people to surf the Web
seemed like such a groundbreaking business model that Hayward,
Calif., startup AllAdvantage.com snared $100 million in investment
on top of $34 million from last year, and dozens of copycats popped
up in its wake.
</P>
<P>
   But what looked groundbreaking then seems foolhardy now.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that AllAdvantage had to withdraw its initial
public offering last week, citing adverse market conditions, said
Omar Sacirbey, senior editor for IPO Reporter. The market is fed up
with companies that are giving away millions of dollars in hopes of
earning money sometime in the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be giving stuff away anymore,'' Sacirbey said.
``Investors just aren't into that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   AllAdvantage pays its members 53 cents an hour to browse the Web
while viewing advertisements displayed in a floating window called
a viewbar that hogs about 10 percent of the screen space. But the
biggest earners make their money _ as much as thousands of dollars
a month _ through the plan's pyramid scheme aspect: Members earn 10
cents an hour for each new member they refer.
</P>
<P>
   AllAdvantage plans to turn a profit by collecting demographic
data about the company's 2.9 million active members, then selling
advertising that's super-targeted to those members' interests.
AllAdvantage learns about its members through surveys and by
tracking _ with permission _ what Web pages they visit.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the phenomenal advertising revenues AllAdvantage was
banking on have not materialized. AllAdvantage has taken in a mere
$14.4 million from its March 1999 launch to March this year.
Meanwhile, every 45 days, the company sends its members checks _
$49.8 million since its inception. All told, AllAdvantage has lost
$102.7 million. Its financial filings state that it expects to be
unprofitable for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that highly targeted advertising, so promising in
theory, doesn't exist yet in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune magazine recently called AllAdvantage the ``dumbest
dot-com in the world.'' What does that make the company's 40-odd
copycats, smaller startups that hoped to follow its path to riches?
The me-toos include the Bay Area's Spedia, ClickRebates and Jotter.
Then there are variations on the theme: Radiofreecash.com pays
people to listen to Internet-based radio broadcasts, and
AdSavers.com users earn money for downloading advertisements that
play like screensavers. Most of these companies are tiny and have
little outside capital, although there are exceptions: Santa Clara,
Calif.'s ClickRebates and Washington, D.C.'s AdSavers.com each have
$3 million in venture funding.
</P>
<P>
   AllAdvantage first showed signs of stumbling last month, when it
reduced the number of hours that members could surf for pay each
week from 25 to 15, while raising the hourly ``wage'' from 50 to 53
cents.
</P>
<P>
   The company also raised the minimum amount it would cut a check
for and changed its payment schedule from monthly to every 45 days.
Because users money for each new member they sign up, and for the
125,000 members with 20 or more referrals, the changes reduced
monthly checks by hundreds of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The changes were a way of controlling costs after many more
people than expected signed up, said Alex Gourevitch, an
AllAdvantage spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire growth of the program took us aback,'' Gourevitch
said. ``We had 2 million members signed up before we knew it.''
About 15,000 new members sign up each day.
</P>
<P>
   While not all the AllAdvantage wannabes have had the ``problem''
of becoming too popular, too soon, they share AllAdvantage's
difficulty in selling targeted ads.
</P>
<P>
   Some AllAdvantage ads appear when the viewer visits a related
site; for example, Eve.com ads appear when AllAdvantage users visit
the beauty section of iVillage.com. But most of AllAdvantage's ads
are general, not targeted, the company disclosed in financial
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers aren't ready for highly targeted ads, said
Gourevitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that there have been issues with
educating the advertisers,'' he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most (ad buyers) are not set up in their marketing departments
to utilize the targeting that is available,'' said Rich LeFurgy,
chair of the Internet Advertising Bureau, an industry group whose
members include America Online, Microsoft and AllAdvantage.
``There's a lot more work required than there is in doing a media
buy on network television or cable.'' LeFurgy is also an
AllAdvantage investor and board member.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, said analyst Michele Slack of New York's
Jupiter Communications, supply currently exceeds demand for ad
placements on the Internet. That puts ad-dependent companies in a
tight spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in the space is going to be desperate for ad
dollars,'' Slack said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say Internet advertising has a bright future _ for
those companies that survive long enough to see it. Advertisers are
spending 54 percent more online this year than they were last year,
according to AdZone Interactive, which measured this year's
Internet ad sales at $1.26 billion so far. Forrester Research
expects annual Internet ad spending to hit $33 billion orldwide by
2004.
</P>
<P>
   AllAdvantage employs ``media strategists'' to show advertisers
how targeting could benefit them. The company also plans to
introduce a new strategy it calls ``behavioral targeting.'' The
idea is not just to show users an ad for binoculars when they're
visiting a bird-watching page, but to notice that this user
frequently visits pages related to wildlife and to show that user
wildlife-related ads on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   All this surveillance may seem invasive, but pay-to-surf program
members agree to give the information up. AllAdvantage's privacy
policy states that it doesn't provide specific names or e-mail
addresses to its advertisers, just aggregated information about
surfing habits.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies in this space, including AllAdvantage, are
branching out beyond the pay-to-surf model. AllAdvantage recently
started a program that pays members to read e-mail ads. The company
is dabbling in e-commerce, letting users rent antivirus software
using the money in their AllAdvantage accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But without IPO cash, analysts warn that AllAdvantage and its
copycats may not survive to see their plans pan out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty skeptical,'' said Jupiter's Slack. ``If they can't
continue to get funding in the meantime, then they're going to have
problems. I think right now their business model is highly
questionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Another specter haunting pay-to-surf companies is cheating.
Several programs available online let users get paid without
viewing any ads. Some programs simulate surfing activity without
requiring the user to be at the computer; others block out the ads.
AllAdvantage's financial filings acknowledge that these programs
have become effective and difficult to detect and warns that the
use of the software could seriously damage AllAdvantage's business.

GROW A BUSINESS: MAYOR OF KOBE, JAPAN, KNOWS WHERE TO FIND
WEB  ASSISTANCE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Kobe, Japan, is turning to two Bay Area dot-coms
to help it rebuild from the devastating earthquake that struck five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Mayor Kazutoshi Sasayama has come to San Francisco to
unveil an infrastructure development Web site Wednesday to help
Kobe spread the word about more than $4 billion in construction
opportunities. Projects include a new Kobe Airport slated to open
in 2005, an international multimedia and entertainment city on a
port island and a huge medical industrial development project.
</P>
<P>
   Sasayama is going against the traditional Japanese approach of
sticking with known and mostly homegrown financiers and
contractors. His enlistment of the two Bay Area companies to
develop the Web site is part of that strategy.
</P>
<P>
   One is Infrastructureworld.com, a South San Francisco, Calif.,
company started by former Bechtel Enterprises Chairman Cordell Hull
with $11 million in private financing to facilitate development of
major construction projects worldwide. The other is B2B Accelerator
by Neptune Technologies, a Santa Clara, Calif., company that
specializes in helping companies build business-to-business
marketplaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission was to build the first government-to-business site
to attract people to work on or make investments in infrastructure
projects,'' said Tim Burr, B2B Accelerator's senior vice president
of marketing. Hull, a distant relative of the former secretary of
state of the same name, added that the Web site
( &LR; www.infrastructureworld.com/ikobe &LR; ) will allow Kobe to ``reach a
broader audience more quickly and is further evidence of Japan's
move to open up its economy.''
</P>
<P>
   TURNSTONE'S TURN: Everyone talks about how IPOs have been
pounded and that's true for many dot-coms, especially if you look
at how the stocks have fared since their opening trading price
rather than offering price to select investors.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, new issues did surprisingly well in the first half
of 2000, especially when compared with the stock market indexes.
</P>
<P>
   The 50 local companies that went public in the first six months
of this year were up an average of 84 percent, according to IPO
Monitor. By contrast, the Dow Jones industrial average skidded
nearly 9 percent and the Nasdaq composite slipped nearly 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the 41 Bay Area companies that went public in the
first half of last year gained an average 138 percent. For all of
1999, the 126 local companies that went public soared a stunning
358 percent on average.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lower trajectories this year, Northern California
new issues continue to outperform the average IPO in the United
States by a 2-to-1 ratio.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the 504 companies that went public across the country
gained an average 191 percent, according to IPO Monitor. In the
first half of 2000, the 212 companies that launched IPOs gained 38
percent on average.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's top IPO so far this year is Turnstone Systems Inc.,
a maker of equipment and software that allow installation of
high-speed online connections from remote locations. The Mountain
View, Calif., company soared from $29 on February to $165.67 on
June 30 for a 471 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many hot IPOs, even investors who bought Turnstone for
$97 at the end of its first day of trading are looking good. And so
far this month, Turnstone is up another 19 percent to $197.50.
</P>
<P>
   Investors' infatuation with high tech is definitely not over.
Eight of the top 12 new public companies in the country in the
first half are high-tech firms based in the Bay Area, according to
IPO Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   They are No. 3 Nuance Communications, up 441 percent; No. 6 ONI
Systems, up 328 percent; No. 7 Quantum Effect Devices, up 283
percent; No. 8 New Focus, up 272 percent; No. 10 Stanford
Microdevices, up 270 percent; No. 11 Numerical Technologies, up 243
percent; and No. 12 Centillium Communications, up 242 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted that 15 of the 50 local IPOs fell below their
offering prices. The dogs of the bunch are both dot-coms that shed
more than 80 percent of their value: ImproveNet, a Redwood City,
Calif., provider of online home improvement information and
services, fell to $2.50 from $16. Pets.com, a San Francisco online
retailer of pet products, dropped to $2.15 from $11.

EPA INSTITUTES WATER RULES BEFORE A BILL BLOCKING THEM BECOMES
LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  By MATTHEW L. WALD and STEVE GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Environmental Protection Agency issued new
water pollution rules Tuesday, trying to outmaneuver members of
Congress who thought they had killed the measure two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic drew criticism from House members and a public
advocacy group &UR;  &LR; that accused the agency of delaying publicizing
reports on the workplace dangers of a toxic chemical featured in
the film, ``Erin Brockovich.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the new rules _ which would set pollution limits
based on local water conditions _ attached an amendment blocking
them to an unrelated military construction bill.
</P>
<P>
   But the EPA said Tuesday that it would make the rules official
by publishing them in the Federal Register on Thursday morning _ a
few hours before President Clinton is scheduled to sign the
military construction bill into law.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's move thus effectively sidesteps the efforts to kill
the new water regulations. Clinton, in a statement Tuesday, called
the rules ``a critical, common-sense step.''
</P>
<P>
   But the maneuvering did not play well with lawmakers who thought
they had won the previous round.
</P>
<P>
   ``EPA's arrogance under this administration has risen to new
heights,'' said Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., who is chairman of the
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA designated the new regulations as a ``major rule,''
which makes them subject to recall by Congress for 60 days. But
Carol Browner, the EPA administrator, predicted that Congress would
not vote to stop the rules if it involved ``a full review, and a
public review.''
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents of the rules conceded that she was probably
right. A two-thirds majority would be needed to block the
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a new approach to water pollution, called Total
Maximum Daily Load, which, like the current law, seeks to make each
body of water ``fishable and swimmable.'' Under the new program,
states would set levels of emissions for local areas, rather than
the federal government setting allowable levels of emissions.
</P>
<P>
   The rule will require ``comprehensive planning on a
river-by-river, lake-by-lake, and bay-by-bay basis by local and
state governments, working in partnership with the EPA,'' Browner
said. It will also add ``nonpoint sources'' of pollution _
including sites like farmers' fields, or woods where trees are
harvested _ to ``point'' sources like factories and sewage
treatment plants.
</P>
<P>
   EPA lawyers determined that while the agency could get the rules
on the books before the military construction bill became law, it
would have to abide by another part of Congress' provision:
delaying the effective date of the new rules until October 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also made some changes to the regulations _ based in
part, Browner said, on complaints from members of Congress _ giving
the states more flexibility in how to enforce them.
</P>
<P>
   While the maneuvering was going on, a public advocacy group
started by Ralph Nader, the Green Party presidential candidate,
accused the administration of dragging its feet in releasing a
report and issuing new rules on the workplace dangers of the
chemical, hexavalent chromium.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists for the group, Public Citizen, asserted that the EPA
had for five years delayed publicizing reports that the chemical
was far more dangerous than previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   The study, done in conjunction with scientists at Johns Hopkins
University, found that lung cancer death rates among people working
with the chemical were almost double what earlier studies had
found.
</P>
<P>
   Public Citizen also accused the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration of delays in issuing tougher rules to protect
workers from the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial experts estimate that from 200,000 to 400,000 workers
have been exposed to the chemical, which is used in pigments,
chrome-plating and in making metal alloys.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Lurie, deputy director of Public Citizens' Health Research
Group, said the delays in regulating the compound reflected what he
called the administration's systematic underenforcement in
occupational safety. He insisted that Public Citizen's attacks were
not intended to advance Nader's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   The study included 2,357 men who worked at a chromate production
plant in Baltimore between 1945 and 1975, following them through
1992. The report found that lung cancer deaths for the workers
occurred at 1.8 times the rate that would have been expected
compared with similar Maryland residents.
</P>
<P>
   EPA and Johns Hopkins researchers presented the study's
preliminary findings in 1995. But Public Citizen scientists, who
obtained the study through the Freedom of Information Act, faulted
the agency for waiting five years before publishing the findings.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the agency said it would propose an exposure rule on
hexavalent chromium by March 1995. Public Citizen officials
complained Tuesday that no rule has been yet proposed, though OSHA
officials said they plan to issue a rule by June 2001.

 PAY-TO-SURF NOT PAYING OFF FOR WEB SITES  &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY

   AllAdvantage first showed signs of stumbling last month, when it
reduced the number of hours that members could surf for pay each
week from 25 to 15, while raising the hourly ``wage'' from 50 to 53
cents.
</P>
<P>
   The company also raised the minimum amount it would cut a check
for and changed its payment schedule from monthly to every 45 days.
Because users money for each new member they sign up, and for the
125,000 members with 20 or more referrals, the changes reduced
monthly checks by hundreds of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The changes were a way of controlling costs after many more
people than expected signed up, said Alex Gourevitch, an
AllAdvantage spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire growth of the program took us aback,'' Gourevitch
said. ``We had 2 million members signed up before we knew it.''
About 15,000 new members sign up each day.
</P>
<P>
   While not all the AllAdvantage wannabes have had the ``problem''
of becoming too popular, too soon, they share AllAdvantage's
difficulty in selling targeted ads.
</P>
<P>
   Some AllAdvantage ads appear when the viewer visits a related
site; for example, Eve.com ads appear when AllAdvantage users visit
the beauty section of iVillage.com. But most of AllAdvantage's ads
are general, not targeted, the company disclosed in financial
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers aren't ready for highly targeted ads, said
Gourevitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that there have been issues with
educating the advertisers,'' he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most (ad buyers) are not set up in their marketing departments
to utilize the targeting that is available,'' said Rich LeFurgy,
chair of the Internet Advertising Bureau, an industry group whose
members include America Online, Microsoft and AllAdvantage.
``There's a lot more work required than there is in doing a media
buy on network television or cable.'' LeFurgy is also an
AllAdvantage investor and board member.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, said analyst Michele Slack of New York's
Jupiter Communications, supply currently exceeds demand for ad
placements on the Internet. That puts ad-dependent companies in a
tight spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in the space is going to be desperate for ad
dollars,'' Slack said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say Internet advertising has a bright future _ for
those companies that survive long enough to see it. Advertisers are
spending 54 percent more online this year than they were last year,
according to AdZone Interactive, which measured this year's
Internet ad sales at $1.26 billion so far. Forrester Research
expects annual Internet ad spending to hit $33 billion orldwide by
2004.
</P>
<P>
   AllAdvantage employs ``media strategists'' to show advertisers
how targeting could benefit them. The company also plans to
introduce a new strategy it calls ``behavioral targeting.'' The
idea is not just to show users an ad for binoculars when they're
visiting a bird-watching page, but to notice that this user
frequently visits pages related to wildlife and to show that user
wildlife-related ads on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   All this surveillance may seem invasive, but pay-to-surf program
members agree to give the information up. AllAdvantage's privacy
policy states that it doesn't provide specific names or e-mail
addresses to its advertisers, just aggregated information about
surfing habits.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies in this space, including AllAdvantage, are
branching out beyond the pay-to-surf model. AllAdvantage recently
started a program that pays members to read e-mail ads. The company
is dabbling in e-commerce, letting users rent antivirus software
using the money in their AllAdvantage accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But without IPO cash, analysts warn that AllAdvantage and its
copycats may not survive to see their plans pan out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty skeptical,'' said Jupiter's Slack. ``If they can't
continue to get funding in the meantime, then they're going to have
problems. I think right now their business model is highly
questionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Another specter haunting pay-to-surf companies is cheating.
Several programs available online let users get paid without
viewing any ads. Some programs simulate surfing activity without
requiring the user to be at the computer; others block out the ads.
AllAdvantage's financial filings acknowledge that these programs
have become effective and difficult to detect and warns that the
use of the software could seriously damage AllAdvantage's business.

A REAL AIRCRAFT MAN RUNNING BRAZIL'S TOP AIRLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER L. RICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Ozires Silva, the new president of Brazil's
largest airline, Varig, says he has earned the right to speak his
mind about airplanes. He assembled models as a child, flew military
jets in the air force and built passenger jetliners into the
country's leading export business.
</P>
<P>
   So Silva, 69, a former top executive of the Embraer aircraft
maker, is blunt about the problems that he says confront Varig _
high costs, big debts, excessively stringent government rules and a
bad reputation among the flying public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hostility that our society has toward air transportation
companies is palpable,'' Silva said. To remake Varig, he said, ``we
have to remove these obstacles; you have to have soil that is
relatively fertile in order to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Silva, who had been a member of the Varig board, was appointed
in May to replace Fernando Pinto as president after the airline
reported a $53 million loss last year and its debt grew to almost
$1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Pinto was not directly blamed for Varig's problems _ the
Brazilian economy was a large reason. The recession last year
caused passenger numbers to drop precipitously, while the
devaluation of the real, Brazil's currency, virtually doubled the
industry's already large stock of dollar-denominated debt.
</P>
<P>
   Of Varig's three major Brazilian competitors, one, Vasp, is
battling to keep creditors from repossessing its planes, while the
others, TAM and Transbrasil, have entered into what amounts to a
merger that enabled them to cut flights and costs.
</P>
<P>
   Pinto, nonetheless, did make some strategic decisions that hurt
Varig. One of the most notable was a cutback in routes to save
money. United States carriers quickly filled the gap and have been
taking away a larger percentage of Varig's international
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   As it became more obvious that the company needed a strong hand
Varig's board decided Silva was that hand.
</P>
<P>
   Silva has made a career of his love for airplanes. At age 13, he
was already building them: models imported from the United States
to his small town in the interior of the state of Sao Paulo. Even
as a child, he remembered in an interview, he would open the kits
and wonder why, with so many natural resources, Brazil even had to
import wood for the base of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked myself why Brazil had fallen behind in this race,''
Silva said. ``Why couldn't Brazil manufacture its own planes?''
</P>
<P>
   The question stuck with Silva for 25 years, as his fascination
with aviation grew. At 17, he joined the air force. He had his
start as a pilot by carrying mail and supplies to distant outposts
in the middle of the Amazon, landing his hydroplane on the region's
snaking uncharted rivers.
</P>
<P>
   By his late 20s, Silva, who was already a seasoned pilot, had
become a flight instructor at the Galeao air base in Rio de
Janeiro. It was there, he said, during a particularly illuminating
3 a.m. flight check over the crescent shaped Atlantic beaches, that
he decided to return to his passion of building airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   After earning a degree in aeronautical engineering at the
Aeronautical Technology Institute in Sao Paulo state, Silva came up
with the design for the Bandeirante, the first-ever regional
commercial jet.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, we never imagined that we would be able to export
the plane, so we didn't give much thought to the name and used
something very Brazilian,'' Silva said. ``It turned out to be a
huge complication. Imagine an American trying to say Bandeirante.
It eventually became the Bandit.''
</P>
<P>
   Appealing to nationalist sentiments that Brazil should build its
own planes, Silva finally persuaded the government and the military
to support him. Embraer, known formally as Empresa Brasileira de
Aeronautica, was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Dec. 22, 1969, the minister of the air force called me to
his office and said that Embraer had to begin operations on Jan. 2,
1970, and that I was to be the president,'' Silva said. ``I was
shocked. When I tried to convince him that I was not the person for
the job, he told me: `You have already created enough problems for
me. Don't create another,' and threw me out of his office.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision was fortuitous. Silva ran Embraer off and on for 21
years until its privatization in 1995. Despite some bumps in the
road, many consider Embraer the country's greatest corporate
success. Indeed, the company is currently Brazil's largest
exporter.
</P>
<P>
   With Varig, Silva has a similar challenge _ to build a
competitive airline. As a start, he plans to renegotiate the
company's debts with banks and leasing companies. He also wants to
take over some of the routes that his competitors have been forced
to give up in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Silva said he also would concentrate on using his influence in
military and aviation circles to persuade lawmakers in Brasilia to
relax the stringent controls that govern the air transport industry
in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   His first priority, he said, will be to press for the removal of
price controls, which now limit how much the airlines can charge on
domestic and international routes. Until the restrictions are
removed and the airlines are allowed to adjust prices to fill
seats, he said, Varig and other Brazilian carriers would have
trouble making money.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go to Congress, I am not going to ask them to get rid
of price controls,'' Silva said. ``I am going to ask them to
explain to me why they exist in the first place. They won't have an
answer because there isn't one.''
</P>
<P>
   The government says changes will be made. A bill before Congress
would create a National Civil Aviation Agency, which would be
responsible for reorganizing the entire industry to increase
competitiveness. How and when the changes will be made remains
unclear, but Silva says he plans to be in the middle of those
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, I would like to contribute to creating conditions
so that the next 500 years of Brazil are different than the last
500 years,'' Silva said. &QL;

 BIG BROTHER'S WATCHING THE STORE  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
``The telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously. ... There
was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at
any given moment. How often, or on what system, the Thought Police
plugged in on any individual ... was guesswork. It was even
conceivable that they watched everybody all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   George Orwell, ``1984''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SAN FRANCISCO _ A half-century after George Orwell painted ``Big
Brother'' as a threat, a San Francisco startup named cEverything
has turned round-the-clock observation via the Internet into a
thriving business.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike conventional security cameras that rely on videotape that
has to be picked up and rewound to be viewed, cEverything's
Web-based service uses tiny video cameras and the World Wide Web to
let managers of restaurants, bars, convenience stores and other
businesses monitor operations anytime, from anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   For example, James Thomas, owner of four Subway sandwich shops
in San Francisco, no longer has to drop in to see if his employees
are behaving properly or wearing appropriate uniforms, thanks to
video cameras mounted at each location.
</P>
<P>
   Teri Hope, owner of Los Gatos Coffee Roasting Co., said
cEverything cameras and online monitoring all but eliminated
``short ringing of sales'' where an employee doesn't record all
transactions and pockets the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Mark Gilpin, owner of Diva's in San Francisco, who
credits cEverything for stopping theft at his gay nightclub and
letting him track whether employees serve customers or try to pick
them up _ a no-no. ``It lets me watch operations from 6 a.m to 2
a.m seven days a week if I want to, even if I'm not there,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Growing Acceptance
</P>
<P>
   CEverything has installed more than 3,000 cameras at about 1,000
sites in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
   The company's operations are part of what seems to be the
growing acceptance of Webcams. So-called ``reality'' television
programs that show folks surviving on a Pacific island or in a
century-old London house have become big hits.
</P>
<P>
   Online cameras now broadcast live images of tourist sites and
rites from such places as the roof of San Francisco's
Exploratorium, Yellowstone National Park's Old Faithful geyser, the
panda pen at the San Diego Zoo, Jerusalem's Western Wall and the
decks of cruise ships.
</P>
<P>
   And Webcams increasingly are creeping into the workplace. They
have been installed at construction sites, child-care facilities,
nursing homes and even kennels to help ensure safety and promote
good behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Some employees have balked at constant Webcam observation,
although few are willing to say much on the record. ``You can't
think about it,'' said one of Thomas' Subway staff during a
particularly busy lunchtime, ``You just have to do your job.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as security cameras have shown, it is perfectly legal
to film employees where they work so long as they are informed of
it and there is some public notice. Cameras in bathrooms or
dressing rooms are not allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Some privacy advocates find the widening use of cameras in the
workplace troubling. ``Video cameras that are on all the time
intrude on the privacy of employees and customers,'' said Barry
Steinhardt, associate director of the American Civil Liberties
Union. He conceded, however, ``There are few legal restrictions.''
</P>
<P>
   CEverything founder and Chairman Michael Trimarco is quick to
insist cEverything is not a ``Big Brother'' service designed to
stop theft or enslave employees.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by $6 million in venture capital with about $25 million
more on the way, the South-of-Market-Street startup is pitching its
services as ``real-time management'' tools to help small and
midsize businesses improve employee productivity and customer
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike conventional video services from security companies such
as ADT, Sensormatic and Johnson Controls, cEverything's offer more
than just video monitoring, which starts at $100 a month for one
camera and $135 for three cameras.
</P>
<P>
   On top of this basic service, cEverything will pile on
additional features for an extra monthly fee. These services
include up to 30 days of video archiving, live tracking of cash
register receipts and online group purchasing of supplies.
</P>
<P>
   CEverything also plans to let clients hear as well as see what
is going on online, process credit card transactions and track
customer traffic and preferences.
</P>
<P>
   Besides managing data flowing out of the business, the company
envisions using the same broadband connections to stream in music,
music videos, games and other entertainment. To beef up management,
cEverything in April brought in Glenn Bacheller as chief executive
officer. Bacheller had been president of the Jamba Juice, Noah's
Bagels and Baskin Robbins chains.
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't Be Everywhere
</P>
<P>
   Trimarco got the idea for cEverything while earning an MBA at
Harvard University three years ago and simultaneously running a
handful of Sorbetto Authentic shops in malls with his brother.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was how to oversee operations when they couldn't be
at the Sorbetto shops, which was most of the time. So the brothers
spent more than $3,500 per location to install cameras, dedicated
phone lines and other gear to monitor business.
</P>
<P>
   After Harvard, Trimarco went to work for Lehman Bros. in New
York, specializing in tax arbitrage, but his mind was on Italian
ices and how the Internet and faster, cheaper broadband service
could make online monitoring a commercial success.
</P>
<P>
   Trimarco and attorney Dave Hong co-founded cEverything in early
1999 with $800,000 from friends and family. In January, Crosspoint
Venture Partners invested $6 million in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Crosspoint partner Jim Dorrian is excited by the market for
``remote management'' services. Before the advent of cheap
broadband services, he said, more than 350,000 restaurant operators
and well over 1 million other small businesses could neither find
nor afford the type of services offered by cEverything.
</P>
<P>
   The basic problem for owners of multiple restaurants and other
businesses is ``they can't be all places at once,'' said Bacheller.
``Now they can monitor traffic and make staffing decisions without
driving from one place to another.''
</P>
<P>
   The maxim ``When the cat's away, the mice will play,''
apparently holds true in many workplaces, said Trimarco. When
managers are around, employees are a lot more attentive, he said.
They don't spend as much time talking with friends on the phone or
in the store. They do little things for customers like make eye
contact and say ``please'' and ``thank you.'' They are careful
about the way they handle food and money.
</P>
<P>
   Two Views at a Time
</P>
<P>
   Subway franchise owner Thomas is sold on cEverything. Since
March, he has installed two cameras _ one in the customer service
area, one over the kitchen _ at three of his stores and is placing
cameras in the fourth shop. The cost: less than $150 per store
including a digital-subscriber-line connection and three days of
video archiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can pick up two cameras simultaneously from my home office
or anywhere else,'' said Thomas. ``I can see the cash drawer
opening and in the future I bet a zoom lens will let me see the
denomination of the bill.''
</P>
<P>
   He said security was his main motivation in buying the
cEverything service. Aside from the inconvenience of going from
store to store to collect video security tapes, he noted that a
thief could steal the tapes along with the cash receipts. That is
not possible with cEverything since the video information is
archived on cEverything servers at a secure remote location.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas also uses the system to monitor employees' work habits.
He said this has helped him spot employees who do not check in on
time, who do not wear required caps, who gab too long with friends
and who give away food.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, employees are more on their toes and Thomas figures
the system will allow him to increase profits on his combined $1
million or so in annual receipts by 1 or 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas acknowledged that ``in the wrong hands, (the cEverything
system) could be demoralizing and have a reverse effect.'' But he
said he has been careful not to ``call up and berate employees
about small things like a dirty table or taking a break too many.''
</P>
<P>
   Diva's nightclub owner Mark Gilpin also is aware of the dark
side of online observation. When he installed four cameras on three
floors of his Post Street club, he recalled, ``There was
resentment. Some employees joked about `God is watching.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Gilpin maintains he won their support after sitting down
with employees and explaining how the system would improve their
security and safety. For example, he said it makes it easy to spot
troublesome patrons who are ``eighty-sixed'' (banned) during one
shift but reappear during another.
</P>
<P>
   Hear Everything Too?
</P>
<P>
   Gilpin and Thomas both want to try cEverything's audio
monitoring service next, especially if it allows two-way
conversations without the need to dial numbers on a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   CEverything co-founder Hong, a former attorney at Morrison &AMP;
Forrester in San Francisco, said cEverything's management services
have been carefully reviewed by the Wilson Sonsini law firm and
comply with legal statutes.
</P>
<P>
   While Hong maintained it is permissible to monitor what
employees say in the course of their work if they are so informed,
he added that audio service is in the test phase.
</P>
<P>
   But privacy experts already are worried. The ACLU's Steinhardt
said monitoring what employees say to each other or customers at
the cash register ``sounds very troubling because wiretapping laws
prevent unconsensual recording of private conversations.''

spent more than $3,500 per location to install cameras, dedicated
phone lines and other gear to monitor business.
</P>
<P>
   After Harvard, Trimarco went to work for Lehman Bros. in New
York, specializing in tax arbitrage, but his mind was on Italian
ices and how the Internet and faster, cheaper broadband service
could make online monitoring a commercial success.
</P>
<P>
   Trimarco and attorney Dave Hong co-founded cEverything in early
1999 with $800,000 from friends and family. In January, Crosspoint
Venture Partners invested $6 million in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Crosspoint partner Jim Dorrian is excited by the market for
``remote management'' services. Before the advent of cheap
broadband services, he said, more than 350,000 restaurant operators
and well over 1 million other small businesses could neither find
nor afford the type of services offered by cEverything.
</P>
<P>
   The basic problem for owners of multiple restaurants and other
businesses is ``they can't be all places at once,'' said Bacheller.
``Now they can monitor traffic and make staffing decisions without
driving from one place to another.''
</P>
<P>
   The maxim ``When the cat's away, the mice will play,''
apparently holds true in many workplaces, said Trimarco. When
managers are around, employees are a lot more attentive, he said.
They don't spend as much time talking with friends on the phone or
in the store. They do little things for customers like make eye
contact and say ``please'' and ``thank you.'' They are careful
about the way they handle food and money.
</P>
<P>
   Two Views at a Time
</P>
<P>
   Subway franchise owner Thomas is sold on cEverything. Since
March, he has installed two cameras _ one in the customer service
area, one over the kitchen _ at three of his stores and is placing
cameras in the fourth shop. The cost: less than $150 per store
including a digital-subscriber-line connection and three days of
video archiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can pick up two cameras simultaneously from my home office
or anywhere else,'' said Thomas. ``I can see the cash drawer
opening and in the future I bet a zoom lens will let me see the
denomination of the bill.''
</P>
<P>
   He said security was his main motivation in buying the
cEverything service. Aside from the inconvenience of going from
store to store to collect video security tapes, he noted that a
thief could steal the tapes along with the cash receipts. That is
not possible with cEverything since the video information is
archived on cEverything servers at a secure remote location.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas also uses the system to monitor employees' work habits.
He said this has helped him spot employees who do not check in on
time, who do not wear required caps, who gab too long with friends
and who give away food.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, employees are more on their toes and Thomas figures
the system will allow him to increase profits on his combined $1
million or so in annual receipts by 1 or 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas acknowledged that ``in the wrong hands, (the cEverything
system) could be demoralizing and have a reverse effect.'' But he
said he has been careful not to ``call up and berate employees
about small things like a dirty table or taking a break too many.''
</P>
<P>
   Diva's nightclub owner Mark Gilpin also is aware of the dark
side of online observation. When he installed four cameras on three
floors of his Post Street club, he recalled, ``There was
resentment. Some employees joked about `God is watching.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Gilpin maintains he won their support after sitting down
with employees and explaining how the system would improve their
security and safety. For example, he said it makes it easy to spot
troublesome patrons who are ``eighty-sixed'' (banned) during one
shift but reappear during another.
</P>
<P>
   Hear Everything Too?
</P>
<P>
   Gilpin and Thomas both want to try cEverything's audio
monitoring service next, especially if it allows two-way
conversations without the need to dial numbers on a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   CEverything co-founder Hong, a former attorney at Morrison &AMP;
Forrester in San Francisco, said cEverything's management services
have been carefully reviewed by the Wilson Sonsini law firm and
comply with legal statutes.
</P>
<P>
   While Hong maintained it is permissible to monitor what
employees say in the course of their work if they are so informed,
he added that audio service is in the test phase.
</P>
<P>
   But privacy experts already are worried. The ACLU's Steinhardt
said monitoring what employees say to each other or customers at
the cash register ``sounds very troubling because wiretapping laws
prevent unconsensual recording of private conversations.''

   Attention editors: Since Sunday, June 4, and for the
subsequent six weeks, The New York Times has published a series of
articles, "How Race Is Lived in America." The series is the outcome
of a yearlong effort by a team of Times reporters to capture some of
the voices of ordinary people and some of the troubling issues that
Americans continue to face. The following photos NYT's 150-156 are
the fourteenth set of photos to move with that series.

<P>
   (NYT156) MATAGORDA, Texas -- July 11, 2000 -- RACE-HOUSTON-7
-- Richard W. Lewis, a blunt, wisecracking businessman in Houston, at
his church in Matagorda, a small Texas town on the Gulf of Mexico,
where he is a singing minister. Lewis, who describes himself as a
"Republican from the womb," backed Lee P. Brown, a Democrat, in his
run for the office of mayor of Houston, on the basis of a simple
calculation: Brown would win. As the owner of a local construction
company, Lewis depended on a friendly City Hall. Ninety percent of
his business came from municipal contracts. Backing the man he
presumed would be the next mayor seemed only prudent. (Monica
Almeida/The New York Times)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT155) HOUSTON -- July 11, 2000 -- RACE-HOUSTON-6 --
Richard W. Lewis, a blunt, wisecracking businessman in Houston. Lewis
was no friend of affirmative action, but ninety percent of his
business came from municipal contracts. Backing the man he presumed
would be the next mayor, Lee P. Brown, seemed only prudent. In
backing Brown, Lewis had risked alienating the people he worked with,
breaking ranks with his own Houston Contractors Association, of which
he was a past president. "I wanted to be in a position of influence,"
says Lewis, "and you can't influence a loser." (Monica Almeida/The
New York Times)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT154) HOUSTON -- July 11, 2000 -- RACE-HOUSTON-5 -- Brian
G. Smith, a 41-year-old architect who runs his own construction
inspection company in Houston, with his son Micah at a ceremony for
his older son Brian's scout troop. More than anything, Smith had
wanted a mayor friendly to affirmative action. Smith remembered the
affront of being denied work because he was black.  So his support
for Lee P. Bown, had largely been bound up with his business
interests. (Monica Almeida/The New York Times)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT153) HOUSTON -- July 11, 2000 -- RACE-HOUSTON-4 -- Brian
G. Smith, center,  a 41-year-old architect who runs his own
construction inspection company in Houston, at work. Smith was
counting on Houston mayor Lee P. Brown's election in 1998 to provide
opportunities for blacks like him who do business with the city. "The
feeling had been that whites would stay in control of Houston," says
Smith. Now, "it was like, 'Wow! Our day has come.' It felt like, at
this time, it was good to be black." (Monica Almeida/The New York
Times)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT152) SAN ANTONIO, Texas  -- July 11, 2000 --
RACE-HOUSTON-3 -- Teaming with Anglos on one hand and nonwhites on
the other, Houston's Hispanics display a kind of cross-racial
dexterity that blacks and whites appear to manage less easily.
Richard G. Castaneda, 54, a Mexican-American, has a theory about why.
"There's still big mistrust between the whites and the blacks," he
says, "and I think it's still much easier for each group to get
together with Hispanics than each other." Castaneda, at the San
Fernando Cathedral in his native San Antonio, where he lighted a
candle for his late son. The 270-year-old cathedral is a spiritual
and cultural center for Latinos. (Monica Almeida/The New York Times)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT151) HOUSTON -- July 11, 2000 -- RACE-HOUSTON-2 --
Richard G. Castaneda, at a power lunch with the Houston mayor, Lee P.
Brown. Castaneda, a Mexican-American, had cast his lot with Brown and
become active in his campaign because he had trusted the candidate
when he said he would be fair to Latinos. He had had doubts about
supporting a black candidate, he said. But Castaneda had recognized
that in Houston, where blacks, Anglos and Hispanics each made up
roughly a third of the population, the 21st century would require
interracial alliances in both politics and business if any one
group's interests were to be served. (Monica Almeida/The New York
Times)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT150) HOUSTON -- July 11, 2000 -- RACE-HOUSTON-1 -- The
election of Lee P. Brown, Houston's first black mayor in 1998, was a
testament to how racial and ethnic groups in Houston had put aside
their suspicions and rivalries and come together largely out of
self-interest to achieve power. Brian G. Smith, 41, Richard G.
Castaneda, 54, and Richard W. Lewis, 51, left to right, all had put
practical considerations ahead of racial ones. (Monica Almeida/The
New York Times)

   (NYT12) SAN FRANCISCO -- JULY 11, 2000 -- TECH-FOREIGN-BOS --
Many companies are working hard to recruit the best talent they can
find despite the shortage of workers with technical skills. Internet
firms such as HotDispatch, HelloBrain, Guru.com, WebPRN and eLance
are connecting companies with scarce labor. These sites have workers
sign confidentiality agreements that prevent them from discussing
their projects in detail. This allows firms to keep the projects from
being leaked to competitors. Ben Ruedlinger, a 24-year-old, MIT
graduate student freelances for a Silicon Valley company called

   (NYT11) BOSTON -- July 11, 2000 -- WRONGFULLY-IMPRISONED-BOS
-- In 1995, 16-year-old Donnell Johnson was accused and later
convicted of murdering a nine-year-old boy. At 22, Johnson is now
looking ahead. After being incarcerated and proclaiming his
innoccence for six years, his body was confined behind bars, but not
his mind. In prison, Johnson renewed his faith, earned a high school
diploma, and emerged wanting to study psychology. A break in the
murder case came last summer when the district attorney who'd always
said Johnson was a killer, began to reconsider his position after
learning of Johnson's innocence from gang members involved in the
killing. Johnson at Dorchester Temple Baptist Church in Boston.

SMARTERKIDS-SHAKEOUT-BOS -- Hoping to leap ahead of its competitors,
SmarterKids.com, an online toy company plans to exclusively sell
educational toys. Executives at SmarterKids.com hope to distance
themselves from Wall Street's hostility and an ongoing shakeout that
has snuffed out several of their online competitors, including
Toysmart.com, Red Rocket and ToyTime. The company is forging ahead
into new areas such as test preparation and tutoring services. Inside

   (NYT9) NEW YORK -- July 11, 2000 -- OBIT-GAULT --  Henri
Gault, a journalist and food critic, who with his longtime colleague
Christian Millau gave the name nouvelle cuisine to modern French
cooking, died at his summer home at St.-Sulpice-en-Pareds in
southwestern France Monday. He was 71. The cause of death was a heart
attack, according to a spokesman for the GaultMillau magazine in
Paris. Henri Gault, right, and his partner, Christian Millau,
traveled to New York in 1981 to promote their new "GaultMillau Guide
to New York." (Sara Krulwich/The New York Times)

   (NYT8) AIN EL HILWE CAMP, Lebanon -- July 11, 2000 --
MIDEAST-REFUGEES -- There are more than 3 million Palestinian
refugees, 80,000 of them crammed into three-quarters of a square mile
of misery in a camp near Sidon, Lebanon, whose future is one of the
issues facing the Camp David summit meeting which opened Tuesday.
They are bitter and fearful as they wait for news, worried that they
will be left out of any settlement. Muhammad Hajar holding deeds,

Conn., and West Orange, N.J., since mid-June. The 500 New York cows
and their suburban cousins won't be leaving until fall, when they

   (NYT4) THURMONT, Md. -- July 11, 2000 -- SUB-MIDEAST-TALKS-3
-- In the same rustic setting where Israel forged its first peace
treaty with an Arab enemy, President Clinton brought together Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in a renewed
quest Tuesday for a lasting Mideast peace at Camp David in Thurmont,
Md. "There is no guarantee of success, but not to try is to guarantee
failure," Clinton said. Insisting on compromise, Clinton said peace
was a "two-way street" and that "both sides must find a way to
resolve competing claims." (Paul Hosefros/The New York Times) *Sub

EDITORIAL: SHREDDING THE CAMPAIGN LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, July 12:
</P>
<P>
   Using an array of dubious legal strategies, the Republican and
Democratic parties have for years circumvented many of the nation's
campaign fund-raising laws. Now comes word that the House
Republican Campaign Committee is so worried about winning
congressional races this year it is considering defying a 1974 law
that limits what state and national parties can spend in
coordination with candidates. Such an action would be another
flagrant violation of the spirit of the election laws at a time
when the public has been disgusted by campaign spending and
fund-raising excesses.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of busting the spending limits base their case on a
recent decision by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which
declared them unconstitutional. But the U.S. Supreme Court has yet
to be heard on the matter, and in any case the appeals court ruling
applies only to the six states within its jurisdiction _ Colorado,
Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming. Indeed the Federal
Election Commission took an unusual step in June, warning the
parties that the ruling applies only to these states and that, if
the Supreme Court overrules the 10th Circuit, it would apply the
law retroactively to any violations.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has ruled that parties may spend unlimited
amounts of money for candidates as long as the spending is not
coordinated with the candidates themselves. But the money at issue
in the new case is money that would in fact be spent in direct
coordination with the candidates and their campaigns. If parties
were allowed to spend money this way, it would encourage anyone who
had given the legal amount to a candidate to turn around and give
it to a party on his behalf. Such a step would mark another
evisceration of the whole concept of curbs on fund-raising and
spending.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republican effort comes at a time of anxiety over
winning seats. As John Broder and Don Van Natta report in today's
Times, Democrats actually have more in the bank at present than
Republicans for House races. But being behind should not tempt
Republicans to gut the law. The fact that they are considering such
a step, first reported in The Wall Street Journal and The
Washington Post, suggests that campaign leaders have learned no
lessons over the past few years _ no lessons from the public demand
for campaign reform, no lessons from the growing popular cynicism
and revulsion over a corrupt political system. It would be
insulting for House Republicans to show brazen disrespect for the
law as well.

   WASHINGTON _ In an aggressive bid to topple the Republicans'
fragile six-seat majority in the House of Representatives, House
Democrats have built and substantial financial advantage over the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had $37.4
million in the bank at the end of last month, $15.2 million more
than the National Republican Congressional Committee had, according
to second-quarter fund-raising reports to be filed this week at the
Federal Election Commission. The gap has more than doubled since it
first became apparent at the end of the last reporting period in
March.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' $37.4 million is the highest cash-on-hand figure
in the party's history. It is 10 times the amount they had in the
bank at a similar point in 1998 and seven times as much as they had
in reserves in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Republicans have raised more money overall for
House contests, their edge over Democrats is far less pronounced
than in previous election cycles and the Democrats have husbanded
their resources. Republicans, on the other hand have spent $68
million of the $90 million raised for House races.
</P>
<P>
   According to Democratic Party officials, their unprecedented
financial success is due in part to lingering anger at the
impeachment of President Clinton and in part because the goal of
retaking control of the House is in sight. As an example of the
Democrats' newfound fund-raising prowess, a dozen nonincumbent
Democratic candidates for House seats in contested districts have
already raised $1 million or more for their races. At this point in
1998, not a single nonincumbent Democratic House candidate had
raised $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts from both parties say that 30 to 40 House races will be
competitive this fall and those races are expected to cost at least
$3 million each and even more in areas where television advertising
costs are high, party strategists said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties had raised record sums through June 30 for House
contests, although the Republicans, who have raised $90 million,
have spent much more of what they have raised than the Democrats,
who have raised $60 million. The fast pace of party fund raising
for House races means that there will be many contests in which the
amount of money spent will swell into seven figures, amounts seen
more often in Senate contests. And recent federal appeals court
ruling in Colorado has encouraged the political parties to consider
ignoring federal spending limits on individual candidates' races.
</P>
<P>
   The large unlimited contributions known as soft money made up
two-thirds of the $60 million raised by the Democratic Party and
about half of the $90 million raised by the Republican Party. Much
of the federally restricted ``hard'' money raised by Republicans
comes through direct mail, a form of political fund raising that is
extremely expensive. So the Republicans have spent substantial sums
raising still more money.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to close the widening cash gap with Democrats, the
House Republicans have started a $16 million program, named
Battleground 2000. The money for the fund is being donated by
Republican members of the House, from their own campaign funds, in
amounts ranging from $700,000 from a few House Republican leaders
to $10,000 from House freshmen. It will be spent to support
Republicans who face tightly contested challenges in carefully
selected districts nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will look at each individual district and see what
Republicans need most _ get out of the vote campaigns, media
campaign, phone banking,'' said Marit Babin, a spokeswoman for the
Republican congressional committee.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Republican push to narrow the gap, campaign finance
experts say they cannot remember the last time the Democrats held
such a dramatic cash-on-hand advantage over the Republicans, who
have routinely out-raised the Democrats by at least a 2-to-1 margin
for many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The congressional Democrats are in a far stronger financial
position than the Republicans going into the general election,''
said Fred Wertheimer, the president of Democracy 21, which
advocates overhauling campaign finance law. ``And to my knowledge,
that has never happened before.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader, and
Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy of Rhode Island, the Democratic campaign
committee has used a variety of methods to attract large donations
from individuals and corporate political action committees.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Democrats expect to raise $1 million at an Aug. 27
fund-raiser in Newport, R.I., featuring the singer Tony Bennett.
The event is being billed as a chance for big donors and corporate
lobbyists to rub elbows with senior House Democrats who will become
committee chairmen if the Democrats regain control of the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic committee is also getting a substantial assist
from Clinton, who has headlined 14 events for House candidates,
raising $8.3 million. Vice President Al Gore has appeared at three
major House fund-raising dinners in recent months, bringing in $3.8
million.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, chairman of the Democratic House committee, said that
money is flowing to House candidates in part because many donors do
not believe Democrats will gain seats in the Senate and are
uncertain about Gore's ability to defeat Gov. George W. Bush for
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're clearly benefiting from the perception that we
need to have a last line of defense,'' Kennedy said. ``We need to
have an insurance policy if this does not end up being a banner
year for Democrats'' elsewhere on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   He said that his job is to ensure that House candidates in tight
races have the resources to compete and declared that the goal was
within reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way things are shaping up now,'' Kennedy said, ``we're not
going to lose a single seat for lack of money.''
</P>
<P>
   A longtime Democratic fund-raiser also attributed the party's
success to an abiding hunger to retake the House. ``We've been out
six years and people are hungry,'' said the fund-raiser, who spoke
on condition of anonymity. ``They're anxious to get back in.''

</P>
<P>
   David Plouffe, the executive director of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, said that donors of all kinds had
helped fatten the committee's accounts. Small contributions are
coming in at a record pace, he said, as well as large gifts from
unions, including a $1 million check from Local 1199 of the Service
Employees International Union, the largest single contribution the
committee had ever received.
</P>
<P>
   Plouffe said the committee was getting ``a lot more from the
Washington corporate community'' _ meaning lobbyists _ as well as
an increase in gifts from wealthy Democrats who in the past gave
chiefly to presidential and Senate candidates.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that Democratic House members have already
contributed $5 million to the committee from their own campaign
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Spending on House races by Republicans in particular could be
increased significantly by a new campaign finance loophole that was
created in May by a federal appeals court in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers Colorado
and five other Western states, struck down a 1976 federal election
law that limits how much money political parties are permitted to
spend directly on behalf of individual House and Senate candidates.
The cap was $67,000 per House district. Although the ruling covers
only six Western states, House Republican leaders and strategists
are considering a plan to funnel millions of dollars in highly
contested races nationwide. The decision will likely be appealed to
the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Since the appeals court decision, the Federal Election
Commission has issued an unusual statement that warns the political
parties that the $67,000 limits are still in effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``No decision has been made'' on whether to heed or ignore the
FEC's warning, said Babin, the House Republican committee
spokeswoman. ``Our lawyers are still looking at it.''

DEUTSCHE TELEKOM MAY PURSUE BOTH QWEST AND VOICESTREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and EDMUND M. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its mating dance with several U.S. and European partners,
Deutsche Telekom's eye has turned toward a deal that would involve
acquiring both VoiceStream Wireless Corp. and Qwest Communications
International Inc., executives close to Deutsche Telekom said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   However, Deutsche Telekom's newfound attention to VoiceStream
and Qwest may also be simply a negotiating ploy to make its other
possible partners _ particularly the Sprint Corp. _ jealous.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last several days, talks between Deutsche Telekom,
Germany's largest telephone operator and VoiceStream, which
recently acquired Omnipoint Communications, the mobile telephone
operator in New York, have intensified, executives close to the
talks said. Deutsche Telekom has informally offered as much as $37
billion for VoiceStream, which has never turned a profit, according
to the executives. At the same time, Deutsche Telekom is
increasingly leaning toward buying Qwest, which if combined with
VoiceStream would give the German conglomerate both a wireless and
fixed-line network that would span most of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   If Deutsche Telekom were to acquire VoiceStream, it would
eliminate any possible bid for Sprint, to which it has made
informal overtures over the last two weeks, the executives said.
Sprint agreed to be acquired by WorldCom Inc. last year, but the
companies are expected to announce this week that they will abandon
the deal because of opposition from regulators. The unraveling of
that transaction makes Sprint attractive to Deutsche Telekom
because it has both a nationwide wireless network through Sprint
PCS and a fixed-line network. But a deal with VoiceStream and Qwest
would effectively replace an acquisition of Sprint, perhaps at a
lower cost.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said a Deutsche Telekom-VoiceStream combination made
sense because VoiceStream's network is based on a standard called
global system for mobile communications, or GSM, which is used in
Europe and parts of Asia and would effectively allow the company to
offer a seamless worldwide wireless network. The deal would also
likely clear regulator hurdles, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it remains unclear whether Deutsche Telekom is primarily
interested in VoiceStream as an alternative to Sprint or as a
bargaining chip, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that Deutsche Telekom, through its reported offer
for VoiceStream, might be sending a signal to Sprint as it attempts
to get Sprint management to take note that there are other
candidates for acquisition in the U.S.,'' said Frank Marsala, vice
president for equity research at ING Barings, in a report.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Sprint fell $4.25 Tuesday, to $47.50, while
VoiceStream rose $14.125, to $139.0625, and Qwest fell 43.75 cents,
to $54. In Frankfurt, shares of Deutsche Telekom fell 2.15 euros,
to 59.25 euros, or $56.47.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom has a long history of being left at the altar,
analysts said. Its effort to acquire Telecom Italia collapsed last
year, and, most recently, it held talks to acquire Qwest. That deal
was scuttled by U S West, which was in the midst of its own merger
with Qwest. Now that Qwest's deal with U S West has been completed,
analysts said it would be much easier to complete a deal with
Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its interest in VoiceStream and Qwest, the company
continues to court Sprint along with Cable and Wireless PLC of
Britain and, to a lesser extent, Global Crossing Ltd., based in
Hamilton, Bermuda, executives close to the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Other suitors for VoiceStream could also emerge. NTT DoCoMo,
Japan's largest mobile telephone operator, and France Telecom,
which recently acquired Orange PLC, Britain's third-largest mobile
telephone company, have both looked at VoiceStream, though neither
are actively negotiating to buy the company, executives close to
those companies said.
</P>
<P>
   VoiceStream has about 2.3 million customers and licenses across
much of the United States. But it remains a start-up company in
many respects, with revenue of only $665.7 million and a loss last
year of $580 million.
</P>
<P>
   That means any acquirer will have to plan for continued heavy
spending beyond the purchase price to build up the business.
</P>
<P>
   One person who has looked closely at the company said it was
expensive by many measures. At its current market value of $30
billion, he said, the company's value works out to about $15,000 a
customer, compared with about $6,000, which France Telecom paid for
Orange.
</P>
<P>
   VoiceStream does own licenses in major metropolitan areas like
New York City and Chicago. But it does not have properties in many
key areas of the United States, including California.
</P>
<P>
   If Deutsche Telekom offered as much as $37 billion, it would be
paying $175 a share. Though the German telephone giant has amassed
a war chest several times that size for acquisitions, the purchase
would force it to define its next steps more precisely than it has
so far.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of Deutsche Telekom, Ron Sommer, has repeatedly
said he wanted to make big acquisitions and that the United States
was a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   But Telekom executives have been vague about their strategic
vision, repeating almost mantra-like that they have targeted ``four
pillars'' of future growth: mobile communications; online services;
access to the Internet and high-speed data networks; and system
services.
</P>
<P>
   In an intriguing twist, Goldman, Sachs owns 4.5 million shares
of VoiceStream and has the right to name one of its 16 board
members. Goldman is also advising Deutsche Telekom on its
acquisition strategy. &QL;

AFTER 213 YEARS, AME CHURCH CHOOSES A WOMAN AS A BISHOP 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE GOODSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ In a groundbreaking step for a church that hews to
tradition, the African Methodist Episcopal Church on Tuesday night
elected its first woman bishop in its 213-year history.
</P>
<P>
   As church members wept and whooped with emotion in the packed
convention hall here, the Rev. Vashti Murphy McKenzie, a dynamic
preacher and community organizer, was swept up in a mob embrace by
her children and husband, supporters and members of her church in
Baltimore. Escorted past the rows of voters, she embraced the
bishop who had first ordained her, and took the bishops' podium
flanked by her sweaty and tearful family and a corps of women
ministers and lay leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brothers and sisters, because of God's mercy and grace, we are
able to stand here in the sun,'' she said in a firm, clear voice.
``The stained glass ceiling has been pierced.''
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie, who is the pastor of Payne Memorial AME Church in
Baltimore, is the first woman bishop to be elected in any of the
three predominantly black Methodist denominations. The AME is the
nation's oldest black denomination, and has often taken a leading
role in civil rights battles and the push for black economic
advancement. The post of bishop in the AME Church is prestigious,
and can transform a local pastor into a national leader.
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie was among 42 candidates for four open seats as bishop,
and another candidate was a woman, the Rev. Carolyn Tyler Guidry,
who as a presiding elder supervises 19 AME churches in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need some female leadership,'' said Crissandra Abernathy, a
church member from St. Louis, as a wave of McKenzie supporters in
red T-shirts swept by. ``She's committed. She knows what she's
doing. And she has the charisma for the job. This is a new
generation, and you have a whole new set of leaders coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   The voting in the convention center in Cincinnati was as
passionately contested as any presidential race. Overseeing the
proceedings from a long table on the dais sat the church's 20
bishops, all of them male, many of them grey with age.
</P>
<P>
   The denomination has 20 bishops in all, 19 assigned to
geographical districts and one responsible for ecumenical
relations. Once elected, bishops serve until retirement. The job
comes with a salary that is usually more than $100,000, and other
perquisites include paid housing and travel costs, and a car and
driver. But some of candidates who are pastors at large,
influential churches already live with such perks.
</P>
<P>
   The AME Church was founded when a group of black worshipers were
forced from their knees while praying at a segregated church in
Philadelphia in 1787. It is now an international organization, with
more than 8,000 congregations and 2.5 million members.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   More than 10,000 church members from the United States, Africa,
the Caribbean, England and Canada on Tuesday filled rows of chairs
on the floor of the Cincinnati Convention Center, which could hold
one and a half football fields, for the vote. Among them were 1,800
voting delegates who registered their choices on electronic
keypads, the first time the group has voted without paper ballots
at its general conferences, which are held every four years to
elect officials and make decisions on everything from budgets to
missionary priorities.
</P>
<P>
   The election was hotly contested and highly political, with
candidates making their way through the convention center shaking
hands and waving, like members of Congress at a county fair.
Supporters dressed in matching T-shirts and caps paraded through
the convention center chanting and singing and carrying signs with
pictures of their favorites. Candidates hand out pencils and water
bottles, hair gel and even toothpaste imprinted with their names.
McKenzie's campaign set up a television screen just inside the
doors of the convention center to play over and over a video
promoting her accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   The election of bishops was delayed by a day, in part because of
a controversy over how many bishops would retire. Bishops in the
AME church are supposed to retire at 75, but lawyers were called in
to resolve disputes over the birth dates of several long-serving
bishops.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict came to a head late Monday night when Bishop Hamel
Hartford Brookins resisted a vote by the delegates in favor of his
retirement. Angry shouting erupted from the convention floor and
the bishops on the dais, and there was a brief attempt to evict
reporters. Eventually Brookins, who in the last decade weathered
financial scandal in his post, was allowed to be ``located''
instead of retired. Under that arrangement, he will be able to stay
on for four more years and serve at-large, on full salary, but a
new bishop will be elected to his seat.
</P>
<P>
   The friction was an indication that many in the church are ready
to see new leaders replace the older generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get the sense among many of the delegates,'' said Mike
McKinney, communications director for the general conference,
``that it is time for new leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Candidates began campaigning as many as four years earlier, at
the last general conference. and some spent the intervening years
traveling around the country and preaching from different pulpits
to make their faces familiar to the voting delegates. Some
candidates were said to spend as much as $40,000 a year in the
quest for a bishop's seat. Supporters say McKenzie raised tens of
thousands of dollars from her sorority, Delta Sigma Theta. She
would only acknowledge that she received ``great support'' from the
group.
</P>
<P>
   The AME Church is the first of the three predominantly black
Methodist denominations, which also include the African Methodist
Episcopal Zion Church and the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church,
to select a woman bishop.
</P>
<P>
   The United Methodist Church elected a woman as bishop in 1981,
and the Episcopal Church consecrated is first woman bishop in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1964, at the church's 37th general conference in
Cincinnati, when the first woman candidate ran for bishop in the
AME Church. The pathbreaker was the Rev. Carrie T. Hooper, an
evangelist, author and composer from New York, said Dr. Bettye
Collier-Thomas, a history professor at Temple University and the
author of ``Daughters of Thunder: Black Women Preachers and their
Sermons, 1850-1979'' (Josie Bass, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   Only 13 delegates voted for Hooper, even though women had 230 of
the 1,067 votes at the general conference, said Collier-Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened is, in the last 30 years,'' said
Collier-Thomas, ``you have more women who felt there was an
opportunity for them to become ordained and to pastor churches.
They went to seminary, they've got degrees, and their numbers have
really risen. But the majority of them in terms of African-American
women find they can't find a pastorate. Many are assistant
ministers, which I call the stained-glass ceiling.''
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie addressed those women Tuesday night in her victory
speech, saying, ``I stand here tonight on the shoulders of the
unordained, women who serve without affirmation or appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't stand here alone, but there is a cloud of witnesses
who sacrificed, died and gave their best,'' she said.

RED LOBSTER WANTS TO NET YOUNGER CUSTOMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON HALL   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ When it comes to mid-priced seafood restaurant
chains, Red Lobster is about the only game in most towns.
</P>
<P>
   Though it controls 40 percent of the national market in casual
seafood dining, the Orlando-based chain commands only about 5
percent of the casual dining market overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think Red Lobster, I don't think casual restaurant,''
said Peter Langlois, a restaurant industry analyst. ``I think
seafood restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Lobster chief executive Dick Rivera wants to get more casual
diners thinking about his restaurant, especially younger customers,
who tend to make snap decisions about where to eat.
</P>
<P>
   He is spending about $300,000 per restaurant for renovations,
plus countless hours on employee retraining, to reinvent the way
customers think about Red Lobster. He is updating the look, turning
up the music and trying to make Red Lobster a dinner destination
rather than just a seafood place.
</P>
<P>
   The most aggressive marketing in company history accompanies the
changes, enticing customers to ``Try the new Red.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa area was chosen as a test market because of its
strength. Red Lobster has 14 restaurants in the Tampa market. They
consistently show profits and are among the company's best in
customer satisfaction ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured if we could improve the experience here, we could
do it anywhere,'' Rivera said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with Red Lobster, Rivera said, is not profits.
Fiscal 2000, which just ended for the chain, was a record-setting
year as sales passed $2 billion for the first time ever. The chain
has seen 10 straight quarters of same-restaurant sales growth. For
the year, profits were up 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So why fix something that apparently isn't broken? Because
Rivera knows that Red Lobster is not mentioned in the same breath
as leading casual-dining chains such as Outback Steakhouse, T.G.I.
Friday's and Chili's, and he wants it to be. To do that, he said,
Red Lobster has to maintain relationships with its core customers
while simultaneously attracting new ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't work to freshen them some time, they're going to
get stale,'' Rivera said. ``It's just like any other
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   What the chain has done in the Tampa market, and will do across
North America over the next four years, is enlarge the bar areas;
update the menu with more daring flavors; place a premium on
alcoholic beverage, appetizer and dessert sales; and modernize the
interior and exterior of its buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The 53-year-old Rivera is no stranger to change at large
restaurant chains. He began his career with Steak &AMP; Ale in the
1970s and while there, oversaw the rollout of the Bennigan's
restaurant concept.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of moves in the early 1980s, Rivera took on the
tough assignment of running T.G.I. Friday's Inc. in 1987. Once
popular as a watering-hole type of restaurant, Friday's was
struggling to survive when Rivera arrived. By updating the menu and
building a better brand identity _ much of what he plans to do at
Red Lobster _ Rivera spurred growth and took Friday's back to the
position of segment leader in casual dining.
</P>
<P>
   The chain started in Lakeland in 1968, and grew quickly after
being acquired by General Mills in 1970. Red Lobster's parent
company, Darden Restaurants went public as a separate company in
1995. Growth has been consistent over the years, and Red Lobster is
by far the largest casual dining seafood chain in America, with 654
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   But when he arrived at Red Lobster in 1997, Rivera recognized
that many of the chain's customers were older, and those customers
had been coming for a long time. In other words, company
demographics showed that most younger Americans didn't consider Red
Lobster when making quick decisions about where to eat lunch or
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just sort of lost touch with what had gone on in casual
dining and in seafood,'' Rivera said. ``People have just sort of
forgotten about us.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera ordered changes that had an immediate effect in the focus
groups and exit surveys, he said. Guests at the remodeled Red
Lobster restaurants reported eating the same food, but they had a
better time. They drank more alcoholic beverages and ordered more
appetizers and desserts.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera then committed the company to making the changes across
the board. Instead of doing it piece by piece, as stores come due
for remodeling, Rivera decided to tie a promotional campaign to the
changes and execute them market by market, beginning with Tampa.

EDITORIAL: AIDS IN SOUTH AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, July 12:
</P>
<P>
   South Africa, the host of the world AIDS conference this week,
has 4.2 million people who are infected with the AIDS virus, more
than any other nation. It also has the world's fastest-growing
epidemic, with infection rates that rose from 13 percent to 20
percent in the last two years. While AIDS is tragic everywhere, it
is particularly so in South Africa, a nation with a wealthier and
more effective government and health care system than other
sub-Saharan African countries.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa has an extensive program of AIDS education, and
most of its citizens know what HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is
and how it is transmitted. Yet that has not led to the practice of
safe sex. South Africa needs creative solutions to cut the
prevalence of AIDS among groups such as miners and truck drivers,
whose itinerancy contributes greatly to the disease's spread. It
needs money to care for orphaned children, and to extend its
clinics and hospitals to poor areas, train and hire health workers
and buy equipment and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   President Thabo Mbeki's musings on whether HIV actually causes
AIDS are unhelpful and have discouraged condom use. Millions of
dollars of last year's AIDS budget in South Africa were not spent
on time. Mbeki's government only recently reversed its policy that
the drug AZT, used worldwide to cut mother-to-child transmission,
was unsafe. Stronger leadership on the problem in Uganda and
Senegal has helped to reduce the prevalence of infection in those
countries. A frank and vocal approach to AIDS from high-level
officials can promote safe sex and reduce the stigma of AIDS, which
is so great in South Africa that people shun available services and
refuse to wear condoms or bottle-feed infants for fear others will
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Since South Africa's health system does function in many places,
it is in a better position than its neighbors _ which will need
Western help to build health systems from scratch _ to offer real
treatment, perhaps even the protease inhibitors that have made AIDS
a more manageable disease for the wealthy. Treatment also gives
people a reason to get tested, slowing the spread of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest obstacle is the cost of medicine, which is often
higher in South Africa than in Europe. In recent months
pharmaceutical companies, the World Bank, governments and
foundations have promised donations of drugs or new money, in some
cases hundreds of millions of dollars' worth. Donated drugs are
important, but South Africa is proposing a more sustainable
solution _ making cheap versions of still-patented drugs or
importing them at less than the makers charge. These steps were
blocked by Washington _ which has since changed its view _ and the
pharmaceutical industry. Wealthy countries should support South
Africa, and help all of Africa to get drugs at the lowest possible
prices.  &QL;

JUDGE CURBS LAWYER IN BIAS CASE AT COCA-COLA 
</HEADLINE>
   By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge Tuesday ordered Willie E. Gary, a Florida lawyer
who is representing four black former Coca-Cola employees in a
racial-discrimination lawsuit against the company, not to interfere
with the settlement reached last month between Coke and four other
employees with similar claims.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the settlement are expected to be announced in
October. The company said on June 14 that it had reached a
settlement ``in principle,'' and would turn to specialists to work
out issues including the size of the cash payments to plaintiffs.
The settlement extends to all current and former salaried Coke
employees who are black who have worked at the company since April
1995, and is expected to include policy changes inside the company
as well as cash. The plaintiffs contended that they were denied
promotions, raises and other advancement because of their race.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-page ruling issued late Tuesday, the judge overseeing
the case, Richard W. Story of U.S. District Court in Atlanta,
prohibited Gary and his firm from soliciting employees who would be
covered by the settlement to sign retainers that would give Gary's
firm a percentage of any cash award from the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also ordered Gary and his firm not to discuss the
lawsuit with employees unless the employees initiated the
discussion, and prohibited him from communicating with any named or
prospective class member directly or through public statements.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was in response to a motion made on June 29 by Cyrus
Mehri, the lead lawyer in the federal racial-discrimination lawsuit
filed against Coke in April of last year. Gary filed a
discrimination lawsuit against Coke, seeking $1.5 billion in
damages, in Georgia state court last month. Gary is also
representing four plaintiffs who originally were represented by
Mehri in the federal lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In the motion, Mehri said Gary had been trying to persuade black
employees to sign agreements that would give the Gary firm 25
percent of any class-action settlement the individuals receive.
Some employees have said they will opt out of the settlement
because Gary told them he could get them larger cash awards.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Coke said the company had no comment. Gary and
his assistant did not return telephone messages seeking comment.

 &HT;    MORMON AUTHOR MAKES 'LEAP' THROUGH ARTWORK(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By BARBARA YOST(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Your story goes here.(Undated) - True to her Mormon upbringing,
author Terry TempestWilliams felt ``set apart'' while writing about
the cancer deaths of her mother and grandmothers in her book
``Refuge.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Mormon church, to be set apart means a kind of state of
grace when the faithful feel especially called to spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   As she wrote Refuge, Williams was able to keep herloved ones
alive. But when she finally published the book in 1991, their souls
returned to heaven, and Williams was left alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a devastating loss,'' she said. ``They were gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Though tragic, that loss led her to a new spiritual journey,
which became the basis for her current work ``Leap ``(Pantheon
Books, $25). Leap is an intimate tapestry that weaves two disparate
themes: Williams' Mormon faith and her discovery of a 15th-century
painting that would obsess her for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Which is the backdrop, and which is the main story?
</P>
<P>
   ``They are equal,'' Williams said .
</P>
<P>
   Known for her ecological activism and environmental
</P>
<P>
   writings, Williams, 44, is a fifth-generation Mormon who grew up
near Salt LakeCity. At 19, she married writer Brooke Williams in a
temple wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Today she clings to the faith of her childhood butsays ``I am
not orthodox.'' In Leap, she turns a questioning eye on her church
while embracing its catechism.
</P>
<P>
   But it is her relationship with Flemish painter Hieronymus
Bosch's masterwork The Garden of Earthly Delights that provides the
ornate frame for contemplation and an unexpectedly rich portrait of
a woman in love {ndash} with art.
</P>
<P>
   The affair began in the wake of her grief over thedeaths not
only of her mother and grandmothers but also the previous deaths of
fourother women in her family, all ``downwinders'' - suspected
victims of an environment
</P>
<P>
   poisoned by nuclear testing conducted in Nevada in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Williams and her husband decided to heal their grief
with a trip to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The day after arriving in Madrid, Williams went to the
</P>
<P>
   Prado, the city's premier museum and home to masterpieces by
Picasso, Dali,Goya, El Greco and Velazquez. As she entered a small
gallery, she found herself standing in front of a three-panel
painting that looked like a landscape, like the view from a window
onto a wondrous and complex scene of angels and devils and impish
mortals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stopped in my tracks,'' Williams said. ``I had seen that
painting before.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams remembered that reproductions of the left and right
panels, depicting heaven and hell, had hung over her bed at her
grandmother's house. The larger center panel was an unfamiliar
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``My body was flooded with memories,'' she said. 'I sent me
literally into a search.''
</P>
<P>
   As that search began, she and Brooke extended their four-day
stay in Madrid to three weeks. Williams returned again and again to
view the painting that had captivated her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't leave,'' she said. ``It was like falling in love.''
</P>
<P>
   Her tryst took her back to Madrid nearly every year.
</P>
<P>
   She kept journals like a schoolgirl writing a romantic diary.
Four years into the affair, she decided to write a work of
non-fiction and to weave religion into her story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know I was on a spiritual path,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she believes that is what happens when ``dogma shatters and
spirituality rises.''
</P>
<P>
   She began to contemplate: ``What do I believe?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, her father, Salt Lake City pipeline fitter John
Tempest, chided her for her obsession with Bosch. She'd had a vivid
imagination since childhood. Was there really such a painting, he
teased?
</P>
<P>
   When she insisted there was, he declared he would go
</P>
<P>
   along on her next visit. So father and daughter made the trip,
walking into theBosch gallery together, prepared to share Williams'
vision.
</P>
<P>
   Instead they found a blank wall bearing only a
</P>
<P>
   postcard reproduction of the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   A guard explained in Spanish and broken English that
</P>
<P>
   the aging triptych was undergoing restoration. He tried to
convey to JohnTempest the nature of the work, especially a section
depicting adultery. Grasping forwords, he finally shouted,
``Lewinsky!''
</P>
<P>
   Tempest returned home, but Williams stayed in Spainanother
month, tracking down the sisters restoring the painting. Convinced
ofher passion, Teresa and Davila Rocio allowed Williams to watch
them work and
</P>
<P>
   even one day handed her a cotton ball soaked in solvent,
inviting her to cleanone small portion.
</P>
<P>
   As she drew the cotton over a nude man with ablueberry for a
head, she felt a connection with his creator:
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the woman the blueberry man is courting; myeyes, mouth
want his lip-luscious face just ripe to place on the center ofmy
tongue. I want, I want to suck every ounce of juice, sweet
blueberry juice, from his blueberry head. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Mormon-owned newspaper, the Deseret News,
</P>
<P>
   has chosen not to review Leap, Williams does not feel the wrath
of thechurch for her frank writings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not been excommunicated,'' she said with asmile. ``I'm
not trying to change
</P>
<P>
   the church. I have no ax to grind. My upbringing isMormon, and
that is the lens I see the world through. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a book about faith, what happens when ourinstitutions
no longer feed us.''
</P>
<P>
   Four months ago, after completing Leap, Williams
</P>
<P>
   returned to Madrid for one last rendezvous. By now, the Garden
was brilliant in itsrefurbishment and had been moved out of the
Bosch gallery, displayed on aplatform, roped off from visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, too, had moved from Salt Lake City to thegentle hamlet
of Castle Valley, 27 miles east of Moab, population 200.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, we were both restored,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Castle Valley, Williams continues to work for theenvironment.
She serves on the
</P>
<P>
   board of the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, whosemission is
to preserve 7 million acres of red rock country. In her own
town,she works with the Castle Rock Collaboration for the
protection of 5,000 acresof pristine land vulnerable to
development.
</P>
<P>
   In the center panel of her beloved painting is a tinyoman
surrounded by birds, one hand cupped to her ear.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is that woman, she said, ``listening to thebirds,
listening to the land.''

TAXPAYERS MERIT BULK OF SURPLUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Somewhere on the road to November's election, the
Democrats' view of a tax cut has shifted from risky scheme to smart
politics.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Vice President Al Gore's tax cut package has
escalated to $500 billion. This still leaves a big gap between his
proposal and the $1.3 trillion relief plan being pushed by GOP
rival George W. Bush, but it's early in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Some may say Bush is laying it on exceedingly thick as a
campaign ploy, but even as large as his tax reduction proposal
appears, it nevertheless remains woefully short of being enough to
meet a taxpayer fairness test.
</P>
<P>
   With each passing month, the estimates of long-term budget
surpluses continue to climb, and the latest stands at $4.2 trillion
over the next decade. Putting aside the reality of how much of this
extra money will come from surplus Social Security tax revenue and
thus add to the national debt, the numbers raise an overlooked
question: Whose money is it?
</P>
<P>
   If there is any surplus beyond that generated by excess Social
Security revenue, all such tax overpayments should be returned to
the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   As one sage analyst observed recently, Washington pols are
playing a sly game by calling the overage a ``budget surplus''
rather than a ``tax surplus,'' which is what it really is. If
America's political leaders were honest, they'd acknowledge that
the money belongs in the first instance to those who paid it into
federal coffers.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has seriously pondered the governed's rightful
relationship with those who govern understands that government has
a rightful claim only to what it needs to discharge its legitimate
responsibilities. If a government takes in more money than needed
to fund its obligations, this represents abuse of political power.
</P>
<P>
   What critics of big business fail to comprehend in their role as
advocates of big government is that the real robber barons are
those in government who take what they have no right to take by
virtue of their position of government power.
</P>
<P>
   A confused reader recently asked why a private-sector profit is
widely perceived as a result of gouging, and therefore bad, while a
public-sector surplus of tax revenue is broadly accepted as a
positive development.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good question because, as the reader noted,
private-sector transactions are voluntary. Thus, profits are
dependent on creating and meeting demand for a good or service
usually offered by any number of competitors.
</P>
<P>
   In our dealings with government, conversely, nobody is
``buying'' anything voluntarily, but rather being compelled by law
to fork over as much of the fruit of our labor as political leaders
think they can get away with taking. Nothing about it is voluntary.
Either you knuckle under and pay up, or you suffer the legal
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   In a more enlightened political climate, both Bush and Gore
would be feeling much more heat to increase their tax-cutting ante,
because the citizenry would be demanding a more equitable shake.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, too many Americans have bought into the idea that it's
a good thing for Washington to gouge taxpayers. Put another way,
obscene profits are somehow a good thing when generated by
burdensome taxation.

NET WORTH: EVEN SMALLER PLAYERS BENEFITING FROM FOCUS ON
FIBER  OPTICS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By KATHLEEN PENDER 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The san Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ These days, you don't have to be a big
fiber-optics company like JDS Uniphase or Corning to be a hit on
Wall Street. All you need is a few grams of fiber in your corporate
diet, and investors will devour your stock.
</P>
<P>
   A growing list of little-known companies are seeing their shares
rise to astronomical _ some would say unsustainable _ heights after
they announce, or even hint, that they have a fiber-optics product,
division or customer. Some are up more than 1,500 percent in the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several companies that have some small portion or a
new focus in fiber technology,'' says Nikos Theodosopoulos, an
analyst with UBS Warburg. ``Investors should do a lot of due
diligence before they buy those stocks. When you peel the onion,
some have good things inside, some do not.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Adept Technology have tripled since the San Jose maker
of factory automation hardware and software said in early May that
Corning would use Adept's robots to automate parts of its
fiber-optics assembly process.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara's Coherent makes lasers for all kinds of
applications, ranging from semiconductor manufacturing to cataract
surgery to Disneyland light shows. The company has had a nice
financial turnaround, but a big reason its stock is up 321 percent
in the past year is that it also makes fiber-optic components and
lasers used to manufacture them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've only gotten into this market in the past year,'' says
Peter Schuman, Coherent's investor relations director. Fiber
accounts for less than 5 percent of total revenues, ``but it's
growing rapidly,'' from $470 million last year to $264 million in
the first six months of this year, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Kluiber, manager of State Street Research's Aurora fund,
says, ``I've liked (Coherent) in the past. It's a leader, it's
profitable and growth is accelerating. But it's not necessarily one
I'd buy'' at today's price.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Newport Corp., which makes test and measurement
equipment, are up 1,657 percent in the past year, mainly because
its sales to fiber optics component makers like JDS Uniphase are
growing. They accounted for 24 percent of revenue last year, and 37
percent in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Keithley Instruments sells measurement equipment mainly to
makers of telecom chips and electronic components. But it also has
some fiber-optics customers, so naturally its shares have advanced
almost 1,700 percent over the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies with strands of fiber include Aeroflex and Zigo,
which both make test and measurement equipment, and GSI Lumonics, a
Canadian laser maker.
</P>
<P>
   GSI confirmed it's doing something in fiber optics, but has
never said exactly what, according to Brian Piccioni, an analyst
with Nesbitt Burns. But who cares? Its stock is up 660 percent over
the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Piccioni recommended GSI about a year ago, when it was around $5
(U.S.) He figures the move up to $20 was based on ``actual
operating results.'' He changed his rating to a hold when the stock
was in the low $20s. He can't explain its continued march up to $40
(it closed yesterday at $33.61), but he suspects it's
fiber-related.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the dot-com situation, where everyone prices out
these bizarre eventualities,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Fiber optics is seen as the solution to the Internet bandwidth
problem because its uses beams of light to carry data, voice or
video at speeds 10 to 100 times faster over long distances than a
conventional communications cable.
</P>
<P>
   One reason these quasi-fiber companies are on a roll is because
there aren't enough real ones to go around. The big guys keep
buying them up.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose's JDS had barely finished buying E-Tek Dynamics when it
announced Monday that it wants to buy rival SDL Inc. (JDS stock
fell $5.44 yesterday to $95.69 after falling $15.06 yesterday. That
brought the value of the offer down to $33.7 billion from an
initial $41 billion. SDL shares fell $2.69 yesterday to $318.)
</P>
<P>
   After JDS, SDL and E-Tek were the biggest pure-play
component-makers, although Corning, Lucent Technologies and Nortel
Networks have big component operations. Lucent and Nortel have
considered spinning off their fiber divisions, to take advantage of
the market's infatuation with the sector.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors say the little guys might try the same strategy.
And because they're so small, it doesn't take much to get their
stocks in a lather.
</P>
<P>
   Max Schuetz, an analyst with Thomas Weisel Partners, warns
investors to ``be wary of all of them. Optical components is a
tremendously difficult game, even for top-tier players, like Lucent
and Nortel.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Jim JungJohann of CIBC World Markets agrees. ``People
are looking for any way to play this,'' he says. ``These companies
are trading like they're all A-grade companies. It's my opinion
you'll start to see a stratification into A, B and C players, as
people become more intelligent investors.''

KANSAS CITY AREA CASINO REVENUE JUMPS NEARLY 10 PERCENT IN FISCAL
YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Riverboat gamblers in Kansas City lost a
record $522 million during Missouri's 2000 fiscal year, which ended
June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-month state budget period was the richest in history for
the area's four casino companies. Casino revenue grew by $46.4
million _ or nearly 10 percent _ from the same period in 1999,
according to the year-end report by the Missouri Gaming Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's 14 riverboat casinos captured nearly $979 million
from players, up 9 percent from fiscal 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures represent casino income before taxes, wages and
all operating expenses. Gambling taxes levied by the state and
casino host communities alone amounted to $292 million for the
period.
</P>
<P>
   Casino executives aren't complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's moving in the right direction,'' said Dan
Weindruch, general manager of the Flamingo Hilton Casino, which was
purchased last month by Isle of Capri Casinos Inc.
</P>
<P>
   For the fiscal year, Station Casino Kansas City won the race for
local market share leader by a nose.
</P>
<P>
   Station grossed $175.45 million and claimed 33.59 percent of the
market's revenue, compared with $175.39 million and a 33.57 percent
share for Harrah's North Kansas City Casino &AMP; Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The operators of the market's two largest casinos have been
handing off the leadership mantle for the past year, with Harrah's
winning seven of those months, Station five.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm going to sound like a broken record,'' said
Station's Midwest president, John V. Finamore. ``But I'm still so
surprised at how vibrant this market is. I'm impressed and very
pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   While Station enjoyed a 7.8 percent bump in revenue growth
during the fiscal year, Harrah's increased at half that pace _ 3.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that Harrah's smaller two-boat facility, with
room for 2,593 gamblers, often operates near capacity. There are
always empty chairs at Station's 3,950-seat twin casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Those dynamics may be changing. In May, Harrah's announced it
would expand its larger Mardi Gras gambling boat with a 1,000-seat
second-deck addition opening in mid-2001 to relieve crowding,
especially on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   While admissions and revenue are up dramatically, gamblers are
actually losing less per casino visit today than they did five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1995 fiscal year, the Gaming Commission reported,
Missouri gamblers lost an average of $24.58 for every two hours
spent gambling.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, that average was down to $20.17. The difference is
volume, with 12 million patron gambling cruises recorded in 1995
vs. 48.5 million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It appears a cinch that the surging revenue will push the Kansas
City market's calendar year total past $500 million, and statewide
revenue past $1 billion, each for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the local market's growth has come since open boarding
began in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   Before the change, casino patrons had to time their arrival to
coincide with phantom two-hour ``cruise'' departures or wait up to
75 minutes for the next cruise.
</P>
<P>
   With casino doors open all the time, admissions and revenue have
been climbing at unprecedented rates since open boarding began in
St. Louis last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest beneficiaries have been the state's one-boat
operations, where the waiting time between cruises had been the
longest.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, the Argosy Riverside Casino saw revenue and
admissions grow by more than 21 percent the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   The Flamingo Hilton Casino, meanwhile, recorded 17.9 percent
revenue growth to go along with a 27.9 percent jump in admissions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile at the Flamingo, Weindruch has served notice on his
competitors that Isle of Capri is not entering the Kansas City
market quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Ads have appeared in recent days promoting ``double points'' for
players every day until 6 p.m., plus expansion of the Flamingo's
popular once-a-week all-you-can-eat crab and shrimp fest to daily
fare.
</P>
<P>
   Much like frequent-flier miles, gamblers earn points for their
play that can be traded for cash, free meals and other rewards.
</P>
<P>
   Weindruch said double points will replace some of the Flamingo's
triple-point bonus promotions, which were used to build foot
traffic on slow weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   Point giveaways are costly to casinos, however, and executives
are always wary of triggering a marketing war that could nibble
away at their bottom lines.

ANGELS-DODGERS RIVALRY NEEDS A SPARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Maybe you had the same reaction as I had to word
that the New York Yankees-New York Mets feud has flared up again,
the result of the unusual ``subway doubleheader'' and the beaning
of Mike Piazza by Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   You heard the Mets canceled plans for their All-Stars to share a
charter flight to Atlanta with the Yankees' All-Stars, and bounced
Yankees players from the Shea Stadium weight room.
</P>
<P>
   And you thought, Isn't that typically beastly behavior by those
greasy New Yorkers. You thought, There's no place for brushback
wars and the risk of grave bodily injury in a civilized society.
</P>
<P>
   You thought, If only the Dodgers and Angels were that much fun.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, can't everybody just get along? On the other
hand, how entertaining when they don't.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets-Yankees dustup should inspire us to wonder again what
can be done to encourage a healthy level of hatred between the
Dodgers and Angels when they open the second half of the season
Thursday through Saturday at Dodger Stadium?
</P>
<P>
   The seeds of a Dodgers-Angels feud have been blowing around in
the sea breeze for 40 years now, ever since the teams shared Dodger
Stadium and Walter O'Malley swindled his tenants into paying for
half of the landscaping toiletries in return for none of the
parking revenue. But the seeds _ of a feud, not the landscaping _
have never taken hold and sprouted.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels expressed bitterness from time to time because the
Dodgers treated them as if they didn't exist. What the Angels
failed to understand is that the Dodgers treated (begin
ital)every(end ital) other team as if it didn't exist. For years at
Dodger Stadium it was easier to find the periodic table of the
elements than the out-of-town scores.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of regular-season, interleague play has changed
things a little. It might actually have hurt the Angels, because it
made the preseason Freeway Series redundant and signaled the demise
of what was, for Anaheim, a big revenue producer. But since
fostering regional rivalries is supposed to be the whole point of
interleague play, it has put a premium on creating a rivalry here
at long last.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Dodgers managing partner and chairman Bob Daly
encouraged general manager Kevin Malone to pursue trades with the
Angels last winter. Nothing panned out, including controversy. The
Dodgers and Angels still haven't swung a major deal since the
seven-player swap that sent Frank Robinson, Bill Singer and a young
outfielder named Bobby Valentine to Anaheim and brought Andy
Messersmith and Ken McMullen to Los Angeles _ in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the case of the Yankees, once forbidden by their
intensely territorial owner George Steinbrenner from dealing with
the Mets, there doesn't appear to be a competitive reason for the
Dodgers' and Angels' unwillingness to trade. It could be that
neither team wants anything from the other.
</P>
<P>
   That's one obstacle to a Dodgers-Angels war. They're too
similar.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have a star at first base; the Angels have a star at
first base. The Angels have a budding star at third; the Dodgers
have a budding star at third. The Dodgers' most dangerous bat is in
left field; the Angels' most dangerous bat is in left field. The
Angels have new guys at second and short; the Dodgers have new guys
at second and short. The Dodgers' relief ace is having an off year;
the Angels' relief ace is having an off year.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team has a spare starting pitcher to trade. (Who does?)
</P>
<P>
   So a trade is out, for now, as a way of creating friction along
the L.A.-Orange County line.
</P>
<P>
   How about a home-and-home doubleheader? That was quite a
spectacle in New York, the helicopter shots of the team buses
making the drive from Shea Stadium to Yankee Stadium between games.
The trouble is that the chances of making it from downtown L.A. to
Anaheim in less than three hours in the late afternoon are slim.
</P>
<P>
   How about a brushback pitch? Both teams have hitters who, like
Piazza, are worth trying to back off the plate. The question is
whether both teams have pitchers capable of throwing straight
enough and hard enough to scare anybody.
</P>
<P>
   How about some old-fashioned jealousy? The Yankees or Mets or
both are always threats to win a pennant. Maybe what we need is for
the Angels to win something and the Dodgers to care enough to get
angry. OK, so maybe this is a project for the future.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times headline writer described the Yankees-Mets
flareup as ``an opera bouffe.'' I'm from Los Angeles, so I don't
know opera, much less bouffe, but it looks like more fun than third
place.

HOLLYWOOD IS ASKED TO JOIN A CAMPAIGN AGAINST DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The drug wars are gearing up in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy is
increasing its campaign to encourage major movie studios, as well
as individual directors and writers, to promote anti-drug messages
in films.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there will be opportunities to leverage popular
movies and videos that responsibly communicate campaign messages,
after they have been released,'' Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the office's
director, said in testimony prepared for a congressional hearing
Tuesday. ``As powerful as television is, some experts believe that
movies have an even stronger impact on young people.''
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning from a panel of the House Government Reform
Committee, and reporters afterward, McCaffrey emphasized that the
government was using only its power of persuasion, not financial
incentives, to influence cinematic themes. The efforts, which he
said could take years to yield results, include briefings,
workshops and conversations with industry leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no money at all, zero, given to any program for
including anti-drug messages,'' McCaffrey told reporters. ``These
decisions are made by the creative community on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   The general's sensitivity on the subject was acute because
similar programs the drug office has for the television and
magazine industries have drawn fire from outside critics as
unwarranted government propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   Until late January, drug office officials were allowed to see in
advance more than 100 episodes on all major television networks. If
the government approved a particular show with an anti-drug
message, the network received credit that reduced the number of
costly public service announcements it was required by law to
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   In response to criticism, the drug office stopped reviewing
scripts and watching episodes in advance. Similarly, it said it did
not read magazine articles before publication in deciding whether
to grant financial credit.
</P>
<P>
   Congress authorized McCaffrey in 1997 to spend up to $1 billion
over five years in television, print and other advertising against
drug use. For every ad bought, the publication or network would run
a public service announcement or incorporate an anti-drug message
into the article or program.
</P>
<P>
   There is no such financial incentive in the arrangement with the
movie industry. The drug office buys anti-drug trailer ads _ $2.4
million worth last year _ to be shown in theaters before movies.
These payments go to the theater owners, not the studios.

AFTER RESIDENCY QUESTION, KANSAS BOARD OF EDUCATION MEMBER SKIPS
MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE BEEM  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. _ The empty chair and the whispered question
provided a tangible undercurrent at Tuesday's Kansas Board of
Education meeting: Where is Scott Hill?
</P>
<P>
   The answer: At his home in Montana, pondering whether to resign
from his 6th District seat on the state board.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas attorney general has said that Hill, who moved to
Montana earlier this year to run his father's ranch, must prove he
is a Kansas resident or either leave the board or face a court
order to remove him.
</P>
<P>
   The matter of Hill's residency came to light last month after
the state board voted 6-4 to transfer 84.5 square miles in
north-central Kansas from the Chapman School District to the
adjoining Abilene School District. Without Hill's vote, the land
transfer would have failed.
</P>
<P>
   The Chapman district has sued in Shawnee County District Court
to have the order set aside. A hearing is set for 9 a.m. Thursday
at the Shawnee County Courthouse in Topeka.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman officials maintain that Hill has relinquished his Kansas
residency and moved to Montana, where he voted in a primary last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said Tuesday from Montana that he was not ready to publicly
announce his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents of his district, which includes parts of 21
counties in north-central Kansas, think it is time for Hill to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased today that Scott Hill's not sitting there
voting,'' Chapman Superintendent Tony Frieze told the board.
</P>
<P>
   Frieze and others said Hill had lobbied to transfer the land
from Chapman to Abilene. But board Chairman Harold Voth said in a
break in the meeting that he never discussed the matter with Hill
until after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   John W. Campbell, senior deputy attorney general, sent a letter
to Hill in late June, saying it appeared that Hill was no longer
living in the district he was elected to represent. Hill has been
registered to vote in Montana since April 25 and voted in the June
6 Montana primary.
</P>
<P>
   Hill has until Monday to respond.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday also marked 11 months since the board voted on new
science standards that de-emphasize evolution. Several speakers,
including Brown University biologist Ken Miller, urged the board to
return to standards that included evolution, the theory that living
things share common ancestors but have changed over time.
</P>
<P>
   One speaker, Rebecca Messall of Overland Park, asked the board
for a ``permanent moratorium'' on implementing any new science
standards in Kansas. She told the board she had found links between
science documents used to write the standards and the eugenics
movement, which held that certain races were superior to others.
</P>
<P>
   The eugenics movement of the early 20th century led to such
horrors as forced sterilizations and the Holocaust, Messall wrote
in a paper she presented to the board.

   NADER IS MINNESOTA BOUND
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota has become a must-stop on the
campaign circuit of presidential contenders. So it should not be a
surprise that Ralph Nader, the Green Party nominee, plans to come
calling on Ventura on Friday. Nader said he asked for a meeting
with Ventura because he has ``a lot of ideas for him as governor.''
Nader also wants to seek Ventura's counsel on ballot access matters
_ and on finding his way into the presidential debates. Does Nader
want an endorsement, too? He said he never asks for endorsements,
and that Ventura is not about to make one. But, Nader said, ``you
don't have to leap a chasm of logic to realize I'd like that.''
</P>
<P>
   THE REPUBLICANS: ALLUSIONS TO CAMPAIGNS PAST
</P>
<P>
   The year 1948 has suddenly loomed large in the presidential
race. It began when the Bush campaign turned to Sen. Strom
Thurmond, R-S.C., to blunt Al Gore's efforts to look Trumanesque as
he attacks Congress as a ``do-nothing-for-the-people'' legislature.
The long-serving Thurmond noted in a statement issued by the Bush
campaign that he had actually ran for president against Harry S.
Truman. ``Mr. Gore, I knew Harry Truman. I ran against Harry
Truman. And Mr. Gore, you are no Harry Truman,'' Thurmond said,
paraphrasing a line about John F. Kennedy that Lloyd Bentsen, the
1988 Democratic vice presidential nominee, used against his
opponent, Dan Quayle. Democrats quickly noted that Thurmond ran
against Truman in 1948 as a segregationist Dixiecrat. And they
pointed out that the statement was released on the same day that
Bush was appearing before the NAACP and speaking of bettering
relations between Republicans and black voters. ``Political
doublespeak, thy name is George W. Bush,'' said Jenny Backus, the
press secretary for the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   THE POLLS: THE RIDGE FACTOR FOR BUSH
</P>
<P>
   A new poll in Pennsylvania shows that Gov. George W. Bush would
benefit significantly in that important battleground state if he
added Gov. Tom Ridge to his ticket. The Keystone Poll, conducted by
the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Millersville
University, shows a statistical dead heat in a head-to-head
contest, with Bush at 44 percent and Gore at 40 percent. The survey
of 634 registered voters has a sampling error of plus or minus 4
points. If Ridge is added to the Republican ticket, Bush's lead
extends to 51 percent to 39 percent, beyond the margin of error.  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, July 12:
</P>
<P>
   The summer cottage where President Abraham Lincoln sought
solitude and relief from the pressures of office was also the place
where he wrote the Emancipation Proclamation, the most important
document of his administration. Anderson Cottage, located four
miles north of the Capitol, has served as a summer home for at
least five other presidents. It was a particular favorite of
Lincoln, who would spend summer afternoons reading underneath the
canopy of a copper beech tree that still stands by the cottage.
</P>
<P>
   If any house is deserving of rescue it is this one, and it is
thus heartening to learn that the National Trust For Historic
Preservation is raising money from private sources to repair the
cottage and add new facilities, including an educational center.
There is already $750,000 in public money in hand, drawn from the
Save America's Treasures program, which is underwritten by
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-room house, in Early Gothic Revival style, currently
serves as an office for the U.S. Soldiers' and Airmen's Home and is
therefore federal property. Its use as office space, its general
neglect and Washington's legendary humidity have damaged the
cottage over the years, and leaking radiator pipes are threatening
its interior woodwork.
</P>
<P>
   The money, as well as President Clinton's recent designation of
the house as a national monument, will protect a 157-year-old
landmark and allow the general public to share its history. As an
important link to the Lincoln era, the cottage's accessibility to
the public is of fundamental educational and national significance.
</P>
<P>
   The effort also reflects well on the whole idea of
public-private partnerships. Save America's Treasures is run
jointly by the White House Millennium Council, established by
Hillary Rodham Clinton two years ago, and the National Trust.
Altogether, the council plans to contribute $30 million in federal
money this year to help preserve 71 endangered historical sites,
and the National Trust a similar amount. Together they will do much
to sustain some of the nation's most compelling pieces of history.

   WASHINGTON _ The United States is seeking the extradition from
Mexico of a man suspected of killing an American anti-drug agent in
Arizona in 1994, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Agustin Vasquez Mendoza, who was placed on the FBI's 10
Most-Wanted list four years ago, was arrested in Puebla, Mexico, on
Sunday by Mexican federal police working with U.S. law enforcement
authorities, the officials said.
</P>

   Vasquez, 30, is being sought for the murder of Richard Fass, a
special agent of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Vasquez
and several associates are accused of killing Fass, who was working
undercover as a potential buyer of 22 pounds of methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   Donnie R. Marshall, the DEA administrator, said a ring led by
Vasquez specialized in the robbery of drug dealers and took part in
murders, kidnappings and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``His apprehension proves to drug traffickers around that world
that no one who harms or kills a DEA agent, law enforcement officer
or other public official will be allowed to remain free,'' Marshall
said.

EPA INSTITUTES WATER RULES BEFORE A BILL BLOCKING THEM BECOMES
LAW 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Subs to correct byline)  By MATTHEW L. WALD and STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Environmental Protection Agency issued new
water pollution rules Tuesday, trying to outmaneuver members of
Congress who thought they had killed the measure two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic drew criticism from House members and a public
advocacy group &UR;  &LR; that accused the agency of delaying publicizing
reports on the workplace dangers of a toxic chemical featured in
the film, ``Erin Brockovich.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the new rules _ which would set pollution limits
based on local water conditions _ attached an amendment blocking
them to an unrelated military construction bill.
</P>
<P>
   But the EPA said Tuesday that it would make the rules official
by publishing them in the Federal Register on Thursday morning _ a
few hours before President Clinton is scheduled to sign the
military construction bill into law.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's move thus effectively sidesteps the efforts to kill
the new water regulations. Clinton, in a statement Tuesday, called
the rules ``a critical, common-sense step.''
</P>
<P>
   But the maneuvering did not play well with lawmakers who thought
they had won the previous round.
</P>
<P>
   ``EPA's arrogance under this administration has risen to new
heights,'' said Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., who is chairman of the
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA designated the new regulations as a ``major rule,''
which makes them subject to recall by Congress for 60 days. But
Carol Browner, the EPA administrator, predicted that Congress would
not vote to stop the rules if it involved ``a full review, and a
public review.''
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents of the rules conceded that she was probably
right. A two-thirds majority would be needed to block the
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a new approach to water pollution, called Total
Maximum Daily Load, which, like the current law, seeks to make each
body of water ``fishable and swimmable.'' Under the new program,
states would set levels of emissions for local areas, rather than
the federal government setting allowable levels of emissions.
</P>
<P>
   The rule will require ``comprehensive planning on a
river-by-river, lake-by-lake, and bay-by-bay basis by local and
state governments, working in partnership with the EPA,'' Browner
said. It will also add ``nonpoint sources'' of pollution _
including sites like farmers' fields, or woods where trees are
harvested _ to ``point'' sources like factories and sewage
treatment plants.
</P>
<P>
   EPA lawyers determined that while the agency could get the rules
on the books before the military construction bill became law, it
would have to abide by another part of Congress' provision:
delaying the effective date of the new rules until October 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also made some changes to the regulations _ based in
part, Browner said, on complaints from members of Congress _ giving
the states more flexibility in how to enforce them.
</P>
<P>
   While the maneuvering was going on, a public advocacy group
started by Ralph Nader, the Green Party presidential candidate,
accused the administration of dragging its feet in releasing a
report and issuing new rules on the workplace dangers of the
chemical, hexavalent chromium.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists for the group, Public Citizen, asserted that the EPA
had for five years delayed publicizing reports that the chemical
was far more dangerous than previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   The study, done in conjunction with scientists at Johns Hopkins
University, found that lung cancer death rates among people working
with the chemical were almost double what earlier studies had
found.
</P>
<P>
   Public Citizen also accused the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration of delays in issuing tougher rules to protect
workers from the compound.

   Industrial experts estimate that from 200,000 to 400,000 workers
have been exposed to the chemical, which is used in pigments,
chrome-plating and in making metal alloys.

   Peter Lurie, deputy director of Public Citizens' Health Research
Group, said the delays in regulating the compound reflected what he
called the administration's systematic underenforcement in
occupational safety. He insisted that Public Citizen's attacks were
not intended to advance Nader's candidacy.

   The study included 2,357 men who worked at a chromate production
plant in Baltimore between 1945 and 1975, following them through
1992. The report found that lung cancer deaths for the workers
occurred at 1.8 times the rate that would have been expected
compared with similar Maryland residents.
</P>
<P>
   EPA and Johns Hopkins researchers presented the study's
preliminary findings in 1995. But Public Citizen scientists, who
obtained the study through the Freedom of Information Act, faulted
the agency for waiting five years before publishing the findings.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the agency said it would propose an exposure rule on
hexavalent chromium by March 1995. Public Citizen officials
complained Tuesday that no rule has been yet proposed, though OSHA
officials said they plan to issue a rule by June 2001.

WHITMAN DEFENDS FRISKING OF BLACK MAN IN '96 PHOTO 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Gov. Christie Whitman on Tuesday defended a 1996
trip in which she cheerfully frisked a black man while accompanying
police officers, and suggested that a photograph of the encounter
was being misrepresented and exploited by her political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The frisking was photographed when the governor went along with
state troopers one night as they patrolled in Camden, the state's
most impoverished city. In her first extensive public comments on
the incident, Whitman brushed aside criticism from civil rights
leaders who say her actions showed an insensitivity to the racial
profiling allegations that have dogged the New Jersey Police for
more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether she would apologize to the man in the picture
_ who was stopped for suspicious activity, searched by troopers,
patted down by the governor and released _ Whitman declined. ``An
apology would be too easy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said that in making the rounds with state troopers,
she was simply being a ``hands-on governor,'' trying to understand
the complexities and dangers of law enforcement. Whitman also said
her only regret was that the picture would be used by her political
adversaries to detract from her efforts to improve Camden's
neighborhoods and her steps to overhaul the state police and
discourage racial bias.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I sorry that this picture is being taken out of context to
undermine the work we've done?'' she said. ``Yes. Am I sorry that
there is a picture out there that can be extrapolated to try to
make me look like something I am not? Of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``But am I sorry that I went in with the state police and I
wanted to show them that I would do anything for them? No. The
citizens of Camden are better off then they were in 1996.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's statements came at a news conference on Ellis
Island, where she presented a $1 million check to rehabilitate the
immigration museum, and her remarks were intended to put the
controversy behind her. But news coverage of the incident has
mounted in recent days, and Whitman was followed by a television
cameras from local stations and national networks.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, whose protest against the state police
closed the Atlantic City Expressway last summer, said he and the
Black Ministers Council of New Jersey planned to hold protests
around the state and at the Republican National Convention late
this month. Those demonstrations could be politically embarrassing
to Whitman, whose supporters have been suggesting her as a possible
vice-presidential nominee or, if George W. Bush wins the White
House, a Cabinet member or ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say a picture is worth a thousand words,'' Sharpton said.
``It might be worth a vice-presidential nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   The photograph, taken by a state trooper, was recently
subpoenaed in a lawsuit by several other officers, who contend that
they were victims of discrimination, but has not yet been entered
into evidence. The Associated Press obtained a copy last week and
it has since been widely publicized on television and in print.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to troopers and a lawyer who is representing officers
who are suing the state police, a supervisor whose subordinates
went along on the 1996 patrol with Whitman had promised a week of
paid vacation to any trooper who could get a picture of the
governor's frisking a black suspect, and used a racial slur to
describe blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said Tuesday she was never told that a reward was being
offered for a picture, and said she still thought race had nothing
to do with the decision to frisk the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Race was not a factor,'' Whitman said. ``He had already been
identified as a suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   But defense lawyers predicted Tuesday that the the photograph
would help them fight the criminal case against two troopers
charged in the April 1998 shooting that catapulted racial profiling
to the top of the state's political agenda. In that shooting,
Troopers James Kenna and John Hogan face charges of attempted
murder for wounding three unarmed black men during a traffic stop
on the New Jersey Turnpike. They are also accused of filing false
reports to conceal the race of the drivers they stop.
</P>
<P>
   If the troopers stand trial, the picture will be used to assert
that officers were encouraged to use race in selecting whom to stop
and arrest, said Jack Arsenault, the lawyer who represents Kenna.
``There'll be a lot of evidence that this is how they were trained,
that one of the factors in profiling criminals is race,'' Arsenault
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Henri Gault, a journalist and food critic, who with his longtime
colleague Christian Millau gave the name nouvelle cuisine to modern
French cooking, died at his summer home at St.-Sulpice-en-Pareds in
southwestern France on July 10. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was a heart attack, according to a spokesman
for the GaultMillau magazine in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like losing a father,'' said Luc Dublanchet, a writer for
the well-known monthly food connoisseur's publication. ``Gault's
enthusiasm for food was absolute and his energy was astonishing. He
still could get carried away talking about a restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, Gault was a bored reporter for Paris Presse, now
defunct, who preferred writing about tennis to covering local
politics. Millau, an editor on the paper, asked him to try
restaurant reviews and they were an immediate success.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no such thing as serious gastronomic journalism,''
Millau later recalled. ``Restaurant reviews were a function of
advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   The two gathered Gault's reviews and just about everything else
about Paris they could think of into a book which was published as
``The Guide Julliard'' in 1964. It included hotels, candy shops,
bookstores, couturiers, hairdressers, gift shops and the best place
in Paris to buy a pedigreed cat. A year later an American edition
appeared, published by Odyssey Press.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, the pair began their monthly magazine, combining their
names into a single title GaultMillau. Eventually, the magazine
would publish separate editions for different regions of France.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973 the two published the first ``GaultMillau Guide to
France.'' Over the next three decades, their joint name would
become as familiar to food lovers around the world as the
gastronomic bible they always hoped, but never quite managed, to
unseat, the red ``Guide Michelin.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of stars, which the Michelin book had employed since
1926, the GaultMillau awarded toques, the tall French chef's hats.
They also gave a numerical award, using a 20-point scale.
</P>
<P>
   The new guide was like a breath of fresh air on the French
gastronomic scene. Compared with its longish, irreverent, witty
reviews, the older Michelin read like the telephone directory.
</P>
<P>
   It was possible to achieve four toques in the GaultMillau but,
on the theory that no restaurant was perfect, never 20 points. The
most any restaurant ever received was 19 points until, in the
1980s, during a spat with the famous Lyonnais restaurateur Paul
Bocuse, who had always received 19 points, Gault and Millau awarded
someone else 19.5.
</P>
<P>
   Most toques were black. Red toques were reserved for proponents
of the so-called nouvelle cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   Gault and Millau did not invent nouvelle cuisine but they were
its champions. Today many chefs insist they were there at the
beginning, but it was Bocuse, his colleagues over the mountain in
Roanne, the Troigros brothers, and Alain Chapel who created the new
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in The New York Times in 1979, Mimi Sheraton described
nouvelle cuisine as a ``gastronomic revolution'' characterized by
``the verdant brightness and herbaceous freshness of its dishes
with an emphasis on lightness and the elimination of heavy
flour-laden sauces so typical of classic French cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   By promoting the chefs who specialized in nouvelle cuisine,
Gault and Millau unwittingly ushered in the era of the celebrity
chef. Before them, chefs labored anonymously in their kitchens. Now
abetted by a horde of publicists, chefs like Bocuse, Jean Troigros,
Michel Guerard and their acolytes became media stars. Chefs like
Alain Ducasse and Joel Robuchon in France and Wolfgang Puck and
Emeril Lagasse in the United States owe at least some of their fame
to the trend started more than 30 years ago by Gault and Millau.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of Millau's praise for his colleague, their
relationship became strained as their business grew and led to a
bitter split in the 1980s. Friends said that Millau had always been
the businessman and Gault the artist and that as the business
became large and more complex, they disagreed on its direction.
Eventually it was sold.
</P>
<P>
   On his own, Gault published several books, including guides to
the best 50 restaurants in France, the best foreign restaurants in
Paris and the best 300 restaurants in Europe. They never achieved
the popularity or the influence of the original GaultMillau guide.

WYNALDA HOPES TO TURN IT AROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For all that Eric Wynalda has meant to U.S.
Soccer, his Major League Soccer career has been defined more by his
mouth and injuries than his goal striking abilities.
</P>
<P>
   He left his previous two stops, in San Jose and Miami, with
unfinished business, never living up to the reputation he carved
for himself during three World Cup appearances and as a promising
young striker with F.C. Saarbrucken of the German Bundesliga.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Wynalda was dealt from Miami to New England for
midfielder Ivan McKinley. The move reunited Wynalda with his
friend, John Harkes, and coach Fernando Clavijo, whom he has played
with.
</P>
<P>
   Wynalda, who has 34 goals in 106 appearances with the U.S., is
finally on a real contender for the MLS title. New England is
second behind New York/New Jersey in the East, and Tuesday the Revs
added 26-year-old Spanish striker Jose Luis Morales, formerly of
Real Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need this team more than this team needs me,'' said the
31-year-old Wynalda, hoping to turn his bad fortune around. ``I'm
not here to be a hero, I'm just excited to be part of it. I want to
finish out the year strong and make a run at a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   That usually sounds like Wynalda in the beginning, optimistic
and full of expectations. At some point, however, he usually starts
whining about playing time or injuries.
</P>
<P>
   But at least he admits his own faults.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've created some of my own bad press and I'm aware of that,''
said Wynalda. ``But I'll tell you what, when you are me, when
you've been around as long as I have, people are going to have
their opinion of the way things should be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to understand that 90 percent of the players who
play in this league don't know what it's like to be anywhere else.
Sometimes things come out the wrong way.''
</P>
<P>
   Wynalda's troubles began in 1997 when former San Jose coach
Laurie Calloway accused Wynalda of saving himself during MLS
matches for National team games. Wynalda missed 22 of 37 games that
season, mostly because of a nagging groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   More injuries limited Wynalda to only 16 of 32 games in 1998,
prompting San Jose to trade Wynalda to Miami in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Wynalda's career in Miami took a big blow before it started.
While on loan to Leon of the Mexican first division, Wynalda
suffered an ACL tear, limiting him to only six games with the
Fusion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   This season Wynalda appeared in only six games with Miami
because of a calf injury and had arguments with coach Ivo Wortman
over playing time. Wortman was fired and replaced by Ray Hudson.
Hudson then had his run-ins with Wynalda, casually questioning the
severity of Wynalda's most recent injury. Wynalda didn't appreciate
it, which subsequently led to last week's trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't appreciate him making a mockery of my health, I don't
think my injury was treated with the utmost seriousness,'' said
Wynalda. ``I like Roy, I think he's a great guy, but I just didn't
see anything funny about what he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to be on the field, I don't like watching games,
especially when we're losing a lot of those games.''
</P>
<P>
   Wynalda is hoping to be injury free when the Revolution meets
New York/New Jersey on Saturday. This is a pivotal time for
Wynalda. He's in the last year of his MLS contract, and while he's
still popular, he knows his MLS career is incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt the injuries I've sustained and the bad luck
I've had has worn on me,'' said Wynalda. ``I have more in common
with (injury riddled) Tab Ramos than people know, but the important
thing is to get it right and use the remaining days of my career to
its full advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   With back-to-back World Cup qualifiers in hostile Central
American surroundings, U.S. National team coach Bruce Arena added
veteran Tab Ramos to the mix. The U.S. opens Group ``E'' semifinal
matches against Guatemala in Mazatenago on Sunday, followed by a
trip to Costa Rica the following week.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos, a veteran of the 1990, '94 and '98 World Cups, has played
well for the New York/New Jersey MetroStars since returning from a
calf injury. Ramos feels his experience is the primary reason Arena
selected him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Ramos said. ``I feel the team can do fine
without me. They're playing well, but it can never hurt to have a
little depth and experience in the games that really matter.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid distractions, the U.S. team is arriving in Mazatenago
just a day before the match and will bring its own food. These are
dangerous trips. In the past, the U.S. players have been hit with
batteries and an array of other objects. Galaxy defender Paul
Caligiuri once had mace sprayed on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environment on the road makes the difference,'' said
Ramos. ``It has nothing to do with what happens between the lines
of the field because both teams want to win and it's going to be a
tough game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's everything else around you, the things that get thrown at
you; the way people treat you the whole time you're there. Those
are the types of situations that are uncommon, that you usually
don't see at friendly games. Games in Central American are even
more difficult because of all the politics involved with
representing the United States.''

 GRACE MacNEIL, 92, LEADER OF GIRL SCOUTS  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grace M.S. McKittrick MacNeil, a civic worker and philanthropist
who was the national president of Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. from
1969 to 1972, died June 30 in Natchez, Miss. She was 92, lived in
Natchez and had also lived in Princeton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   MacNeil was a longtime owner and operator of plantations in
Mississippi and Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   After holding paid and unpaid posts with Girl Scouts of the
U.S.A., whose headquarters are in New York, she was on its board of
directors for some years and was elected national president after
holding lesser executive posts in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   While she was president, she ``led the organization to its
highest membership, of over 3.9 million members,'' Girl Scouts of
the U.S.A. said in announcing her death. She also oversaw the
beginning of a national Girl Scouts program of education about, and
improvement of, the environment. Her philanthropies included giving
more than 60 acres of land to help preserve a Natchez Indian
historic site.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Natchez and graduated from H. Sophie Newcomb
College in New Orleans. Her husband, Douglas H. MacNeil, died in
1963.
</P>
<P>
   Her survivors include two daughters, Elizabeth Boggess and Anne
MacNeil, both of Natchez; a grandson; and two great-grandchildren.

 VINCENT D. McDONNELL, 81, LABOR MEDIATOR FOR STATE  
 By BRUCE LAMBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Vincent D. McDonnell, whose witty charm as New York
state's chief labor mediator helped to settle disputes involving
workers ranging from gravediggers to Radio City Music Hall
Rockettes, died on Saturday at Beth Israel Medical Center in
Manhattan. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   His wife of 55 years, the former Eileen Mary Nolan, died on
Monday at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center of
complications from a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats alike called on McDonnell to serve in
city and state administrations. He was chairman of the State
Mediation Board from 1963 to 1977 under Govs. Nelson Rockefeller,
Malcolm Wilson and Hugh Carey, and worked on New York City labor
disputes for Mayors Robert Wagner, John Lindsay, Abraham Beame and
Ed Koch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had an endless store of relevant stories, humorous, that
would illustrate a point, and he would use one that fitted at a
tense moment in negotiations.'' said Theodore W. Kheel, a fellow
mediator who often worked with him. ``It was itself a form of
mediation.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell's skills were tested in a wide range of strikes
involving, among others, taxicab drivers, tugboat crews, boiler
operators, sanitation workers, racetrack parimutuel clerks,
Broadway musicians, and workers at Stuyvesant Town, where he lived.
</P>
<P>
   Public pressure was often intense as the various disputes
canceled ballet and theater productions, shut down schools, halted
harbor traffic, created mounds of uncollected garbage and even left
corpses unburied.
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell explained more than once that he had chosen a red
carpet for his office because it concealed ``the blood that's been
spilled here.'' He was also fond of quoting a Casey Stengel
aphorism: ``They say it can't be done, but that don't always
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the use of mediators is voluntary, their first hurdle is
to gain the trust of the opposing sides. Kheel said of McDonnell:
``He was able to establish a rapport with people on both sides. He
was their friend, the friend of the enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell himself said that a successful mediator ``must have
the skill to detect if there are intramural personality problems
among negotiators on the same side of the table or personality
problems between opposing negotiators.''
</P>
<P>
   Timing was another factor, McDonnell said. Sometimes it was
fruitful to nudge the parties into all-night marathons, but other
times he prescribed a break and a fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving his state post, McDonnell became a partner in the
law firm of Shea &AMP; Gould and later joined the Rodgers &AMP; Wells firm.
Although he more often represented management, he also had union
clients, including, for the last 22 years, the Detectives Endowment
Association of the New York City Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell joined in the effort to save Radio City Music Hall and
the Rockettes from extinction. Working for Madison Square Garden in
the early 1980s, he helped keep it in business by seeking
concessions from 17 unions and getting government aid.
</P>
<P>
   In politics, McDonnell _ ever the mediator _ had friends in both
major parties. He served as a campaign chairman for Andrew Stein, a
Democrat, when he ran for Manhattan borough president in 1977. But
he also advised two Republican presidents, Ronald Reagan and George
Bush, on labor issues when they were running for office.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong Manhattan resident, McDonnell was the son of an
elevator operator. During World War II, he served in the Army Air
Corps intelligence division as a captain and provost marshal at
Wright Field in Ohio. After the war, he graduated from New York
University and its law school.
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell held a series of posts at the U.S. Veterans
Association, Voice of America, General Bronze Corp. and Eagle
Pencil Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. and Mrs. McDonnell are survived by two sons, James V. and
Brian J., of Manhattan, and two daughters, Jeanne T.
McDonnell-O'Shea, also of Manhattan, and Mary Theresa McDonnell of
Manhattan Beach, Calif.

WILLIAM RANDALL, 90, MISSOURI CONGRESSMAN WHO LED IMMIGRATION
PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Rep. William J. Randall, a conservative Democrat who
represented his native Independence, Mo., from 1959 to 1977, died
there on July 7. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Randall, a lawyer, was an unabashed champion of Independence,
the hometown of President Harry S. Truman.
</P>
<P>
   Randall, who represented Missouri's 4th Congressional District,
was sworn in on Capitol Hill in March 1959 after winning a special
election necessitated by the death of his predecessor, Rep. George
H. Christopher, another Democrat. After 16 years in the House,
Randall decided not to seek re-election in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   He was a member of the House Armed Services Committee and the
Government Operations Committee. As chairman of the latter
committee's Legal and Monetary Affairs Subcommittee, Randall came
to national prominence in the early 1970s when he conducted an
inquiry into illegal immigration from Mexico and charges of
corruption in the Southwest region of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   In his last two years in Congress, Randall also headed a special
Select Committee on Aging, which conducted hearings on long-term
health care for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   William Joseph Randall graduated from the University of Missouri
in 1931 and from the University of Kansas City's law school in
1936. He served with the Army in the Pacific in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Randall then served on a Jackson County administrative court for
12 years until his election to Congress. When he left the House he
worked as a railroad lobbyist before returning to Independence,
where he had a private law practice.
</P>
<P>
   His wife of 47 years, Margaret Layden Randall, died in 1989.
Randall is survived by a daughter, Mary, two grandsons and a
great-granddaughter.

NYC'S SUMMER SCHOOL EFFORT PLAGUED BY TRUANCY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite an intensive weeklong campaign to round up
truants, more than 130,000 students in kindergarten though 12th
grade _ nearly 40 percent _ are missing from the most ambitious
summer school program in New York City's history, the Board of
Education said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The poor attendance is a costly and potentially embarrassing
culmination to months of obsessive planning. And it shows how hard
it is to make a difference in the lives of children, even when
everything seems in place on paper, in a system as big and complex
as New York City's.
</P>
<P>
   As summer school opened last Wednesday, Chancellor Harold Levy
and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had announced with much fanfare that
more than 300,000 students were registered. More than 200,000 of
those students are required to go, and the rest are being strongly
urged to attend because of poor performance.
</P>
<P>
   Levy, who was hired in January for his management skills,
conceded that the rocky start of summer school was a setback. ``The
real honest answer is, we should have 100 percent attendance on the
mandatory side,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 24 percent of the students mandated to attend in third
through eighth grade have not showed up, and half of the high
school students required to attend are absent. While the rate of
absenteeism among mandatory students is about the same as last
year, when the city experimented with a much smaller summer school
program, expectations were much higher this year, as the Board of
Education and Giuliani vowed to end social promotion, the automatic
advancement of students with their age group, even if they are
failing.
</P>
<P>
   Across the city on Tuesday, a survey of more than a dozen
schools by The New York Times found scattered problems with
classrooms that lacked air-conditioning, schools that were not
providing transportation, and some that were serving bag lunches
instead of hot meals.
</P>
<P>
   But attendance was by far the biggest obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   From Bushwick to Harlem, many teachers were standing in front of
nearly empty classes. The Board of Education has budgeted $150
million on instruction alone, for small classes of 12 to 15
students, yet many schools had just six to eight students in a
class, and some had as few as three.

COWBOYS' IRVIN BIDS PLAYING DAYS, FANS FAREWELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Michael Irvin, who leaves the Dallas Cowboys
with 20 team receiving records, three Super Bowl rings and five Pro
Bowl appearances, waited until Tuesday to retire in what was an
emotionally charged news conference at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin wore a mustard-colored shirt and tie that matched his
mustard-colored suit. His heartfelt farewell _ something he
considered inevitable for several months _ was juxtaposed amid his
laughter and his tears, as the normally glib Irvin struggled at
times to get the words out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not hard to say goodbye to the game. I'll say goodbye to
playing football,'' said Irvin, choking back the tears. ``But it's
hard to say goodbye to playing football here for America's Team,
America's fans. I just want to say, `Thank you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The day that Irvin, 34, decided never to play football again
came this off-season when his wife, Sandi, watched tearfully as
Irvin played in the backyard with his four children. Her tears were
for what might have been if the career-ending spinal injury
suffered Oct. 10 at Philadelphia had left Irvin with life-altering
paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Irvin has all his faculties and should live a normal
life. He moves into a broadcasting career with Fox Sports Net and
will work alongside Chris Myers on a weekly NFL TV show.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a physical standpoint, I can probably still line up and
play football,'' said Irvin, who learned immediately after his Oct.
10 neck injury in Philadelphia that he has a congenital condition
known as cervical stenosis, in which an abnormally narrow spinal
column increases the chance of paralysis if the spinal cord again
suffers trauma.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I knew that there would never be peace with my wife or
peace with my family if I ever played again,'' said Irvin,
recalling that scene in his backyard several months ago. ``And so,
from that moment on, I pretty much rationalized that I would never
play the game again.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin sent laughter through the gathering of media, family,
friends and about a dozen former teammates and coaches Tuesday when
he added: ``Would I be stupid enough to still be playing football
if I was alone, by myself? Most definitely.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin did receive what he believed to be approval from at least
one neurosurgeon to continue his career, if Irvin himself ``really
wanted to.'' But he said his mind was made up for him by those who
love him most: his wife and children, and his mother, Pearl, in
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., along with a large family that includes his
16 siblings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really went hunting for that doctor,'' Irvin
acknowledged. The decision to retire ``was an emotional thing, a
family thing.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Cowboys will miss from Irvin, often called ``the
Playmaker,'' will be his 750 career catches (tied for 10th all-time
in the NFL), his 11,904 career yards (ninth all-time) and his 65
career regular-season touchdown catches (most by a Cowboys
receiver).
</P>
<P>
   But probably more than the gaudy numbers, the Cowboys will miss
Irvin's legendary work ethic and his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``What made Michael so special was the way that he worked,''
Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman said. ``He practiced every day as
if he was going up against the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC
Championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Campo, who has coached on teams in which Irvin played at
the University of Miami and with the Cowboys since 1989, expressed
disappointment Tuesday that his first year as a head coach at any
level will have to unfold without Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Folks, you are looking at the most competitive receiver to
ever play the game,'' Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jerry Jones added: ``We will not replace Michael Irvin in
what he has meant to the Dallas Cowboys. We have to get there
(without him) ... but we have to get there in a little different
way now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have the fastest tandem of receivers in team history
in Joey Galloway and Rocket Ismail, but they lack a proven
possession receiver, the role defined by Irvin before his neck
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin brought a sense of togetherness to a team sport. His
belief that ``a team has to be a family'' was echoed in his words
Tuesday, as Campo began inquiring immediately after Tuesday's news
conference how to use some of Irvin's comments as a teaching tool
for young players in training camp, which begins next week.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin's popular image took a hit in March 1996. On his 30th
birthday, he was arrested during an early-morning drug bust at an
Irving hotel, along with two women and a former college and Cowboys
teammate, Alfredo Roberts. Cocaine was found in the room.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin received a five-game league suspension at the start of the
1996 season. He entered a plea of no contest to the felony drug
charge, and received 800 hours of community service and four years
of deferred probation, which he completed last week.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1996, Irving was falsely accused by a woman of
sexual assault. Only after the incident had been well-publicized
nationally did the woman admit that her story was not true.
</P>
<P>
   Irving's career was further muddied by his rumored involvement
in ``Scissorgate,'' an incident in which teammate Everett McIver
received a cut to his neck during the Cowboys' 1998 training camp.
The incident was followed by coach Chan Gailey's decision before
the 1999 season to hand Irvin a reduced role in the offense after
he had caught only one touchdown pass during the '98 season.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin expressed little complaint publicly, and had caught three
touchdown passes in the first three games when he suffered a neck
injury on what appeared to be a routine catch-and-tackle in the
first quarter at Philadelphia. As Irvin lay motionless on the
Veterans Stadium artificial turf, he lost feeling in both arms and
legs for about 15 minutes, and fans booed. This prompted one
Philadelphia newspaper to write the next day: Unspeakable, even for
us.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin was asked recently by his 2-year-old son, Michael, how to
tackle. Irvin began to show him, then was overwhelmed by the
feeling of how lucky he is to be able to show him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've shared some great times, and I've shared some
not-so-great times here,'' Irvin said. ``But never once in my heart
did I ever see myself playing for anyone other than Jerry Jones, or
for any team other than the Dallas Cowboys, or for any fans other
than Cowboys fans.''

IRVIN'S LAST DANCE SKIPS THE BIG FALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Yo, Mike. Loved the suit.
</P>
<P>
   And the little story about your ``happiest moment as a Cowboy''
being a block you once threw for Emmitt Smith? Priceless.
</P>
<P>
   And what's that? You said you knew it was time to retire when
your wife got tears in her eyes, worried that you'd get hurt again
and wouldn't be able to play with your kids? Man, the TVs ate that
up.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Irvin, lest we had forgotten, always did know how to
play to an audience.
</P>
<P>
   And so he bid goodbye to football in both dramatic and disarming
fashion Tuesday. In a news conference at Texas Stadium, Irvin
reminisced about the good times while lightly stiff-arming aside
the bad ones.
</P>
<P>
   It was only casually alluded to during the news conference, but
Irvin was forced to retire from the Dallas Cowboys because doctors
discovered that he has a condition called spinal stenosis that,
with another hit, could cause permanent paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning this fall, Irvin announced, he will become a
studiocommentator on Fox Sports Net's ``NFL This Morning'' show on
Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother always said that when God closes a door, he opens up
another one,'' Irvin said.
</P>
<P>
   By all means, yes, let's bring mom and God into this.
</P>
<P>
   From coach Dave Campo's opening hug to the announcement of
Mike's new gig, it was grand theater. If you are an Irvin fan, you
probably rose to your feet, shouting bravos.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of us, I assume, were supposed to act like those NFL
officials _ keep the yellow flags in our pockets and look the other
way.
</P>
<P>
   Either reaction is fine. Irvin deserves the hosannas that have
come his way this week.
</P>
<P>
   But before we line the path to his Mercedes with palms, let's
make sure we get the complete perspective straight.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, by any measure, was a great NFL receiver and played a
starring role in the Cowboys' rise to Super Bowl prominence. Yet,
his indiscretions helped bring about the end of the franchise's
glorious '90s ride.
</P>
<P>
   One incident? On the scales of the justice system, that may be
true.
</P>
<P>
   But Irvin's 1996 arrest, busted with cocaine and two
``self-employed models,'' became the cause celebre that resonates
throughout the franchise to this day.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin's ultimate no-contest plea led to a five-game suspension
in the 1996 season. The Cowboys lost three of those five games.
Without home-field advantage, they were ousted from the playoffs by
the Carolina Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   The franchise hasn't won a playoff game since.
</P>
<P>
   It all took its toll. Because of the Cowboys' off-field
headlines, owner Jerry Jones made a public display of wanting to
cleanse the team's image. Coach Barry Switzer didn't help things by
being nabbed at the airport in 1997 with a pistol in his gym bag.
In the draft, the club passed on All-Pro receiver Randy Moss,
fearing that he had a too-cloudy past.
</P>
<P>
   At training camp in 1998, Irvin was involved in a scuffle over a
haircut with teammate Everett McIver. Brandishing scissors, Irvin
left a two-inch gash in McIver's neck, an episode that could have
been termed a violation of Irvin's probation and sent the receiver
to jail.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cowboys whitewashed the stabbing. New coach Chan Gailey
took a credibility broadside by being forced to awkwardly tap dance
around the incident.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it all helped to take the shine off the Cowboys'
star.
</P>
<P>
   It has been said that Irvin paid his debt, served his community
service and kept a clean public ledger in recent times. Yes, on the
overall scheme of forgiveness, he deserves a second chance.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it third? I forget.
</P>
<P>
   What we can measure for certain is his impact as a Cowboys
player for 12 seasons. He was a tireless worker and an unmatched
competitor.
</P>
<P>
   As coach Dave Campo said, the Cowboys will sorely miss Irvin's
``tenacity.'' Nobody seemed to want to win more than Michael Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   His Hall of Fame credentials are solid. But again, Irvin's
off-field troubles might dim the glare from his three Super Bowl
rings and the 750 passes he caught. Electors should vote him in,
though not the first year.
</P>
<P>
   At his final news conference Tuesday, dressed in a
mustard-colored suit, Irvin seemed to swallow away a tear as he
talked about the friendships and the good times he enjoyed with the
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to say thank you,'' he said. ``I just want to tell
everyone thanks for the support, thanks for the moments. I hope I
gave you just a few moments of great feelings and happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin should know that he did.
</P>
<P>
   It was a grand ride. As we shout our hosannas, don't forget that
it could have been even grander. nn

IRVIN'S LEGACY CARRIES NO TARNISH WITH TEAMMATES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Michael Irvin was holding court in typical
Michael Irvin fashion.
</P>
<P>
   It was early in training camp last season and ``The Playmaker''
was delivering a colorful, expletive-filled speech about the
problems he was having with then-Dallas Cowboys coach Chan Gailey
and the possibility of his finishing his career with another team.
</P>
<P>
   He ended his rant saying, ``Y'all are going to miss me when I'm
gone. But whenever I do leave, just say `There goes a ``baaad''
man.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin had no idea then that the end was so near. A congenital
spinal condition forced him to announce his retirement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   To invoke an expression from another bygone era, Irvin was Super
Bad during a 12-year stint with the Cowboys. His career included
three Super Bowl titles and concluded with his owning every major
receiving record in team history.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, Irvin remade ``Shaft'' well before Samuel L. Jackson
decided to recreate the 1970s movie icon.
</P>
<P>
   With the game on the line, who comes through 10 times out of 10?
Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   Can you dig it?
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, however, played as hard off the field as he did on it
with jewelry, tailored suits, limousines and all-night partying.
</P>
<P>
   A few missteps, including pleading no contest to felony drug
possession in 1996, tainted his image, turning him from the toast
of Dallas during the team's championship run to being the prime
example of the evils of modern-day sports.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's gone, his baggage has left some doubt as to how he
will be remembered _ as one of the baddest football players to ever
play the game or just a bad guy.
</P>
<P>
   Those who knew him best _ his teammates who played alongside him
for much of his career _ say their lasting memory of Irvin is their
first: a dedicated, hard-working football player who strove to be
the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the hardest working guy that I have ever been associated
with,'' retired Cowboys fullback Daryl Johnston said. ``He was
always there early in the morning lifting weights, he was running
late on the track to make sure that he was in shape. I have not
been associated with anybody on this team during my tenure with the
Dallas Cowboys that worked as hard as Michael Irvin did.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman, who combined with Irvin to
create one of the league's all-time greatest pass-catching
combinations, said Irvin's first legacy is that he's the most
prolific receiver in Cowboys history. Aikman said Irvin achieved
greatness because of his work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is arguably the hardest-working athlete I've ever been
around,'' Aikman said. ``He wasn't blessed with the greatest speed.
He wasn't blessed with a lot of the athletic ability that some
players are, but he made up for it with desire and his work ethic.
I think his competitiveness and his will to win are two things that
define him and separated himself from a lot of other receivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman understands that Irvin's indiscretions might have clouded
some people's view of him as a football player. But he said that
would be unjust to Irvin, who produced some of the most exciting
moments in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of Michael you think of him making the big
plays in the big games,'' Aikman said. ``He had a lot of those
moments in addition to the enthusiasm and excitement he brought to
the game. Those are things I remember when I think of him on the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael was a great football player. I don't know if he is
spoke of in those terms often enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys safety Darren Woodson echoed Aikman's remarks, saying
people tend to forget how great Irvin was and what he meant to the
Cowboys' success.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to read the headlines and see all the bad things
that happened to the Cowboys and Irvin,'' Woodson said. ``They
forget this guy was here until the wee hours in the morning working
out by himself and pushing his teammates to get to that level.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodson recalled what Irvin did for ``the Cowboys' organization,
bringing guys up and making us competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He made us compete against him in practice,'' Woodson said.
``That's why we won. It carried on to the game. We competed in the
game. That's how we got three Super Bowl rings. Other teams had the
same talent. But we competed harder than other teams during the
games because of Michael.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, indeed, there goes a ``baad'' man. nn

IRVIN FINDS A FOE HE CAN'T BEAT
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Listen to people talk about Dallas Cowboys
receiver Michael Irvin and the first thing they will say is that
he's an intense competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin hated to lose at anything _ whether it was pickup
basketball, football, wind sprints or dominoes.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Irvin, the driving force behind Cowboys Super Bowl
title teams in the 1992, 1993 and 1995 seasons, won a lot. And even
when he didn't win, he didn't go down without giving his all.
</P>
<P>
   That is until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was his retirement from the game a personal setback,
but it's the worst kind because he lost without being allowed to
put up a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin wanted to fight and compete as he always had.
</P>
<P>
   But against this opponent _ cervical stenosis, a congenital
condition that consists of narrowing of the spinal canal _ Irvin's
methods were helpless. The condition makes him more susceptible to
permanent paralysis if he had received another hit to the neck or
back.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin got a taste of what his competitor was like Oct. 10 when
he experienced brief paralysis after a first-quarter hit at
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   His doctors told him to quit. And so did his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could line up and play, but there would be no peace if I
played,'' Irvin said. ``No peace with my wife and no peace with my
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin joins three other players known to have been forced from
the NFL because of a narrow spinal canal: former Houston Oilers
linebacker Frank Bush, former Green Bay Packers cornerback Tim
Lewis and former Detroit Lions defensive back Harry Colon.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Andrea Halliday, a neurosurgeon at the University of
Texas-Southwestern Medical Center, said spinal stenosis is a
condition that normally affects older people and is degenerative in
nature.
</P>
<P>
   She said that for some people, such as Irvin, it is a condition
that people are born with.
</P>
<P>
   Halliday, who has not studied Irvin's case, said surgery is an
option for some people, though maybe not football players.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do surgery that enlarges the canal,'' Halliday said.
``But because the neck would not be as strong as it was before
surgery it might be counterproductive for football players.''
</P>
<P>
   Also making the situation tough on Irvin was that his body,
which he has taken pride working on throughout his career, failed
him.
</P>
<P>
   However, Halliday said Irvin's top-rate conditioning is probably
what allowed him to play as long as he did without incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he is in good condition kept him from having
more problems with it,'' Halliday said. ``His neck is so strong, it
kept him from having the extreme range of motions that get people
in trouble with stenosis.'' nn

IRVIN TRADES HIS GRABS FOR TV GAB
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Talk about a natural transition.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Irvin, one of the NFL's all-time talkers, is taking his
talent to Fox Sports Net as an analyst on the cable network's ``NFL
This Morning'' pregame show, and on its nightly sports news show,
``National Sports Report''.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, 34, revealed his future endeavors shortly after
announcing his retirement from the Dallas Cowboys on Tuesday at
Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not doing this to kill time or fill a void,'' Irvin said.
``This is my career now. As hard as I worked in football, I will
work as hard on this. I am not going in this halfheartedly.''
</P>
<P>
   An electric, charismatic and passionate player for 12 seasons
with the Cowboys, Irvin has always been known for a sparkling smile
and his veracity to speak his mind. He received rave reviews after
making his television debut last season on ESPN's ``Game Day''
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``His competitive fire and outspoken candor,'' Arthur Smith, Fox
vice president of programming, production and news, said, ``will
give our shows a biting new perspective that will certainly
entertain football fans across the country,'' .
</P>
<P>
   On ``NFL This Morning'', Irvin joins a crew of host Chris Myers,
former Buffalo coach Marv Levy and former NFL stars Jackie Slater
and Chris Spielman. The show is seen live each week on Sunday
mornings at 10 a.m. Central time on Fox Sports Net.
</P>
<P>
   On ``National Sports Report'', which airs at 10 p.m. and
midnight Central nightly, Irvin joins Bill Maas, Cris Collinsworth,
Ron Pitts, Slater and Levy as NFL analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to have a lot of fun with Marv,'' Irvin said,
referring to the 1992 and '93 seasons, when Irvin and the Cowboys
defeated Levy's Bills in back-to-back Super Bowls. ``Marv and I
have had a lot of encounters over the years. I'm sure he has a lot
to say to me.'' nn

JONES HAS HAD SPECIAL FONDNESS FOR IRVIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Jerry Jones fell just short Tuesday of assuring
that Michael Irvin will be included in the Dallas Cowboys' Ring of
Honor someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't imagine saying anything about the Ring of Honor
without Michael Irvin's name coming to mind,'' Jones said after
Irvin's retirement announcement at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, meanwhile, made no qualms about fully expecting to
eventually join Bob Lilly, Roger Staubach, Tony Dorsett, Tom Landry
and six other former Cowboy greats inside the famed ring.
</P>
<P>
   Jones would only say that nothing has been planned for Irvin _
yet _ and that there is no timetable after a retirement
announcement to honor a prospective ring member.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has never hidden his fond feelings for Irvin, who was the
team's last link to the Landry years. In 1988, Irvin became
Landry's last No. 1 draft pick (11th overall). Jones bought the
team a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Some feel that Irvin is Jones' favorite all-time Cowboy. Jones
would only say that Irvin is probably the most unique Cowboy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What made Michael so unique was that he not only was extremely
talented, he also was an entertainer. He really helped put on a
show,'' Jones said. ``And he had a way of pushing his body to
alarming heights. I've had trainers tell me that they were afraid
Michael would hurt himself out there. Those are the things that
made him probably the most unique player I've ever been around.''
</P>
<P>
   In 12 seasons, Irving became the most prolific receiver in
Cowboys history, as well as one of the NFL's top 10 in career
catches (750) and career yards (11,904), despite playing in a
balanced offense that included what possibly one day will be the
NFL's all-time leading rusher, Emmitt Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have respect for Michael Irvin,'' said Jones, who recalled
Tuesday the story of how Irvin immediately volunteered to visit
Oklahoma City in the aftermath of the 1995 bombing and lend support
to the families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   These same skills of caring and leadership will be missed with
the Cowboys, Jones pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``His ability to do anything it took to win, then basically call
on that power and use it in a leadership role was beyond anything
I've ever seen anywhere,'' Jones said. ``He would use his will, his
courage, his intensity ... to inspire players, coaches and everyone
else in the organization. You just can't replace that.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Irvin's five-game NFL drug suspension in 1996, and the
controversy it brought to the Cowboys, Jones still can't help but
see the irony here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regretted what happened,'' Jones said. ``Because I knew that
Michael Irvin was not about hurting himself or his teammates. He
was about getting his team ready to play. That was where his heart
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones believes that Irvin was born to play football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his abilities could only have been brought out in
football,'' Jones said. ``He was able to exhibit the kind of
emotion that it takes to play above the pain, above the fray.
Michael Irvin had the competitiveness, the combativeness and the
courage that it takes to play this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Unique skills, indeed.
