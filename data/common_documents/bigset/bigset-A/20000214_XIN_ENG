<HEADLINE> Musharraf Appeals to Pakistanis to Plant Saplings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Chief Executive
General Pervez Musharraf has appealed to fellow countrymen to
plant saplings during "the Spring Tree Plantation Campaign 2000"
which begins on Monday, to make the country prosperous in forest
products, improve food security and environmental stability.
</P>
<P>
"It is my fervent appeal to people from all walks of life in
general and farmers, students and NGOs in particular to make
concerted efforts in planting saplings in the Spring Tree Planting
Campaign, 2000," he said in a message on the occasion of the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's natural forests are hard pressed to meet
the demand for timber and wood. This aggravated situation has not
only resulted in meager supply of wood in the country but also
added to the frequency of landslides, accelerated erosion,
decreased production of hydro-power, loss of irrigation water and
increased occurrence of floods.
</P>
<P>
Provincial forest departments have made special arrangements to
distribute planting stock and provide necessary technical guidance.
"I expect the people will benefit from these arrangements and
special care will be taken to ensure survival of the saplings
planted," Musharraf said.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Ask Britain Not to Grant Asylum to Ariana Passengers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
Sunday warned Britain against offering asylum to former hostages
of a hijacked Afghan Ariana plane, saying such action would
encourage hijacking.
</P>
<P>
According to Afghan sources here, Taliban's Foreign Minister
Wakil Ahmed Mutawakil told a news briefing in Kandahar in southern
Afghanistan that everyone would be encouraged to hijack planes for
seeking asylum in Western countries if London grants asylum to the
passengers.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-four out of the 164 hostages freed Thursday from the
hijacked Boeing 727 jet have requested asylum. Twenty-two people
were arrested in connection with the hijacking.
</P>
<P>
"We have to differentiate between political and economic asylum
seekers," Mutawakil said, adding: "With the return of the
passengers to Afghanistan, terrorism will be discouraged."
</P>
<P>
The plane was hijacked on February 6 while it was on a domestic
flight. The hijackers forced the plane to Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan
and Russia before it finally landed at an airport outside London.
</P>
<P>
Mutawakil dispelled the impression that the Taliban would
punish those asylum seekers and said it would welcome all the
passengers home including those who have asked for asylum.
</P>
<P>
"Our borders are open and there are no restrictions on
travelling outside Afghanistan," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the hijacking, the Taliban have beefed up
security at the country's airports and have deployed armed guards
on all flights.
</P>
<P>
Due to United Nations sanctions imposed against the Taliban
last November, Ariana Airlines is banned from flying outside the
country.

DHAKA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A 48-hour hartal (destructive
strike) and blockade of roads and railways throughout the country
from dawn of February 16 was announced Sunday by the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP)-led opposition alliance.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the hartal and blockade program at an anti-

of the parliament to pave the way for early general elections.

<HEADLINE> IMF Chief Urges Asian Nations to Strengthen Banking Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Managing Director of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) Michel Camdessus Sunday urged
Asian countries to strengthen their banking laws to guarantee the
efficiency of the market economy.
</P>
<P>
"This is being said that the market economy can only work when
if the laws are effective," Camdessus said, adding that the
bankruptcy laws in Thailand as well as in other Asian countries
are inefficient in this respect in letter and in implementation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference during the 10th Session of the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development here, the
outgoing IMF chief suggested the governments in Asia devote some
attention to strengthening the banking laws to help entrepreneurs
and bankers to take the minimum risk while making the maximum
contribution to the society.
</P>
<P>
Asked why the process of the banking reform in Thailand has
been so slow, Camdessus said: "There is still something to do to
strengthen the banking sector in Thailand, not for the sake of
having powerful institutions with more balanced sheet but because
the banking sector must be strong enough to be able to accompany a
stronger recovery."
</P>
<P>
Camdessus will quit his job on Tuesday for "personal reasons."

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Develops Border Gate Economic Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's northern mountainous
province of Lao Cai has been developing border gate economic zones,
Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
About 100 businesses from across the country have been involved
in import and export activities in the border gate economic zone
in Lao Cai.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the import-export value achieved through goods passing
through the Lao Cai border gate reached 800 billion Vietnamese
dong (57 million U.S. dollars), a year-on-year increase of 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
Trading between Vietnam and China has further been boosted
thanks to two fairs on trade and tourism held in Lao Cai province
in 1999 and this year.
</P>
<P>
The number of people passing through Lao Cai's border gates has
increased in recent years, said VNA, adding that as many as 54,000
people passed through the province's border gates and the province
earned 13 billion Vietnamese dong (928,600 U.S. dollars) from
tourism services in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The provincial People's Committee has granted licenses to three
foreign-invested projects which registered a combined capital of 7.
5 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Lao Cai province has a time-honored international border gate,
a railway system and a border market and has become an economic
exchange hub between Vietnam and China.
</P>
<P>
To boost economic development in border gate areas, Lao Cai
province and its Chinese neighboring provinces have started to
build the second Ho Kieu bridge with the aim of promoting
bilateral economic exchange, said VNA.

<HEADLINE> Social Issues at Heart of IMF Agenda: Camdessus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The outgoing Managing Director
of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Michel Camdessus said
here Sunday that social issues are at the heart of the
organization's agenda.
</P>
<P>
Asked at a press conference why he has been so silent on labor
and environmental issues, Camdessus rejected the accusation,
saying he had discussed these issues extensively with leaders of
trade unions around the world and had made efforts to bring social
issues at the heart of the agenda of the IMF.
</P>
<P>
But he added that the issues of labor and environment were
actually not part of his job, saying the World Trade Organization
and other international organizations should take the
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Expected to quit his office on Tuesday after serving decades in
the IMF, Camdessus looked a little nostalgic when answering
questions at the press conference, which was held during the 10th
Session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
</P>
<P>
He made a speech Sunday morning entitled "Globalization and
Poverty Reducing: a Multilateral Approach," which was his last
address to a U.N. forum as Monday will be his last day in office.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his plans after retirement, Camdessus said he has
no plans for the future, but will spend two weeks to organize his
thinking and his life and later spend a few more months to make a
quiet self-reflection.
</P>
<P>
He refused to disclose who will succeed him, and urged people
not to doubt the health and efficiency of the IMF after him.

<HEADLINE> Least Developed Countries Asked to Enhance Structural Transformation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 13 (Xinhua) -- To improve productivity and
competitiveness, the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) should
enhance the structural transformation of their economies
domestically, trade ministers of 48 LDCs said during a meeting
here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial meeting was held in parallel to the 10th
Session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD X).
</P>
<P>
During the private meeting, the ministers discussed the Least
Developed Countries in 1999 Report prepared by UNCTAD, which
recommended LDCs improve productive capacities and competitiveness
through appropriate domestic policy measures to enhance the
structural transformation of their economies and through
international support measures to complement national efforts.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the meeting quoted the report as saying
that public policy, both macroeconomic policies and micro ones in
LDCs has a "pivotal role."
</P>
<P>
LDC governments are also urged to provide an enabling
environment to foster private sector development, said the report.
</P>
<P>
As for international support measures, the report advocated
increased development assistance, broader, deeper and faster debt
relief and technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the 1990s have become the decade of
increasing marginalization for LDCs, because their share in world
exports and imports have declined more than 40 percent since 1980.
</P>
<P>
With a population accounting for 13 percent of the world's
total population in 1997, the 48 countries had a share in world
exports and imports that year of only 0.4 percent and 0.6 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Three quarters of the LDCs derive their export earnings
predominantly from merchandise exports. The majority of them have
a highly concentrated merchandise export structure, in which one
export product -- usually agricultural or mineral -- predominates,
accounting for over half of the total value of exports of goods.
</P>
<P>
The reasons for LDCs' marginalization, according to the report'
s analysis, are structural and supply-side constraints.

<HEADLINE> Camdessus Calls Pie Incident "Professional Risk" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Managing Director of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) Michel Camdessus said here
Sunday that the pie incident which happened on him is part of his
"professional risks."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday morning, a man threw a cream pie on Camdessus'
face before he addressed delegates attending the 10th Session of
the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD X).
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said at a press conference later that he enjoyed the
things on his fingers.
</P>
<P>
"We call this professional risk," he told local and foreign
reporters.
</P>
<P>
After the incident, the local branch of a Belgian bakery,
Patissiers sans Frontieres (PSF), issued a statement, saying it "
regards a cream pie on (Camdessus') face as a slight -- and sweet -
- embarrassment compared to the tremendous suffering that the IMF
has inflicted on the people of the South under the leadership of
Camdessus."
</P>
<P>
Camdessus later gave a speech, in which he said the crisis-hit
economies were recovering and GDP in South Korea and the
Philippines already exceeded pre-crisis levels.
</P>
<P>
It was Camdessus' last important speech as IMF chief as he will
leave his job on Tuesday for "personal reasons."
</P>
<P>
The man who threw the pie, Robert Naiman, is a 34-year-old U.S.
citizen from an organization called "50 Years Is Enough Network."
</P>
<P>
His organization has been invited to attend the conference but
was expelled after the incident.
</P>
<P>
Naiman himself was questioned by security officers of the
conference but was released later.
</P>
<P>
The host country's spokesman said at a press conference on the
incident that Thai police were only responsible for security
outside the convention center, while the security inside were
provided by the United Nations system.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the United Nations does not blame Thai
authorities for the incident.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is said to have mobilized more than 6,000 policemen
and special commandos for the meeting, the largest one Thailand
has ever hosted.
</P>
<P>
An article printed in Saturday's Bangkok Post predicted that
Camdessus would not have "a smooth and glorious end to his career,
" saying that civil groups and people movements had warned they
would protest against Camdessus for his "crime against humanity."
</P>
<P>
The forecast was proved by a rally in front of the convention
center Sunday noon. One of the posters held by the protesters read:
"Put Camdessus on Trial."

<HEADLINE> hke021337--Strong Dynamics for Development at Play Now: IMF Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Managing Director of the
International Monetary Fund Michael Camdessus said here Sunday
that strong dynamics for development are at play now, carrying
along with the promises of more financial stability, of a new
paradigm of development and of a better chance of humanizing
globalization.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an interactive debate of the 10th Session of the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, Camdessus said
positive dynamics have emerged in recent history because a major
economic crisis is being overcome and people can build a stabler
world on its lessons; a new paradigm of development is coming into
being and people recognize better that globalization, if properly
handled, can become a major opportunity for the progress of the
world.
</P>
<P>
"These dynamics can make it possible to fulfill our universal
pledges to reduce poverty and through a reinvigorated
multilateralism to better address our problems in their global
dimension," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the world can draw three lessons from the Asian
financial crisis by recognizing the essential importance of
strengthening all available means of prevention, the decisive
importance of the strength and determination of the reaction of
governments and the ability demonstrated by the international
community to respond with powerful and speedy interventions.
</P>
<P>
The IMF chief, expected to leave his office on Tuesday,
predicted that a new paradigm of development is progressively
emerging.
</P>
<P>
"The new opportunities for growth created by the revolution in
information technology, combined with more resolute efforts to
promote opportunities for all to share in the benefits of growth,
will amplify the positive effects of macroeconomic and monetary
stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the new economic paradigm, rooted in fundamental
human values, taken together with a better ability to prevent and
manage crisis, is a distinct and positive chance of the present
times.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus also predicted that a new perception of globalization
is emerging as people call for common action to transform
globalization into an effective instrument for development.
</P>
<P>
He said people should view globalization as a logical extension
of the same basic principles of economic and human relations that
have already brought prosperity to many countries and the best
means of improving the human condition throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
However, he agreed that globalization has not demonstrated that
it is concerned enough, or capable of overcoming poverty, the
greatest concern of the present times.

<HEADLINE> Three Killed in Collision Between Italian, Portuguese Ships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 14 (Xinhua) -- A collision in the Ionian Sea
between the Italian ferry Espresso Catania and the Portuguese
registered freighter Zafir Sunday night left three person killed,
one survived and nine crew members are still missing after the
freighter apparently sunk.
</P>
<P>
The southern port of Cortone's Authority has ordered all ships
in the area to join in the search for the missing crew of Zarif,
said to be of Spanish nationality.
</P>
<P>
So far only one survivor and the body of three crew members
have been picked up.
</P>
<P>
The Espresso Catania ran around after the collision some 500
meters off Guardavalle, an Italian southern town near the Ionian
Sea. Onboard were 22 people, twenty crew members and two
passengers, they were all survived, in which two people were taken
to hospital for treatment after suffering extreme cold.
</P>
<P>
The only surviving Zafir crew member was rescued by the Russian
cargo vessel Mikka which had been navigating in the area where the
collision took place.
</P>
<P>
The Zafir, with 13 crew members, left the Portuguese port of
Corigliano Calabro at 2 P.M. Sunday with a cargo of 6,000 tons of
clinker and was en route to Marina di Carrara, on the Italy's
Tuscan coast.
</P>
<P>
The Espresso Catania was traveling from Italian southern city
of Catania to central city of Ravenna when it apparently rammed
the cargo ship which quickly sank.
</P>
<P>
The Espresso Catania suffered heavy damage to its bow and was
beached by its captain, who is reported to have told investigators
that the Zafir had been running without lights and had made an
unexpected turn.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot understand why this happened," the Espresso Catania
captain said, "the weather conditions were normal, visibility was
good and everything was going normal. When he had radar contact
the Portuguese ship was about a mile away. We were following a
parallel course and moving faster. Then, all of a sudden, the
Zafir came at us at a 90 degree angle. It was as if it had
mechanical trouble."
</P>
<P>
Searchers are having trouble finding other victims or possible
survivors because of the strong currents in the region.

<HEADLINE> EU to Assess Croatia's Membership Suitability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union offered
the visiting Croatian prime minister a warm welcome by agreeing to
start assessing the country's suitability for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the union's 15 member states agreed
during their council meeting in Brussels to set up a joint
consultative task force for the assessment. The consultative
committee meets on Tuesday with Croatian Prime Minister Ivica
Racan.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian prime minister also planned to visit the NATO
headquarters in Brussels on Tuesday to underline his country's
aspiration to join the western military alliance.
</P>
<P>
Both the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization welcomed the election of Racan's reformist coalition
and the choice of Stip Mesic as the country's new president.
</P>
<P>
Javier Solana, EU's high representative for common security and
foreign policy, told the visitor that the union would like Croatia
to end its backing for Bosnian Croats who oppose the Dayton Peace
Accord and the return of Croatian Serb refugees.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to help your country but I would like to
underline that this change in Croatia is a signal for the region
as a whole," said the former NATO chief who headed the western
military alliance during its 78-day air strike against the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia last year.
</P>
<P>
As a gesture of encouragement, EU's external relations
commissioner Chris Patten is scheduled to attend the inauguration
ceremony of Croatian President Mesic in Zagreb this week while
visits by EU foreign ministers to Croatia are also scheduled in
the near future.

UNITED NATIONS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Monday named Retired Russian Diplomat Yuli Vorontsov
as U.N. coordinator for the return of missing Kuwaitis and Kuwaiti
property.
</P>
<P>
Vorontsov will serve at the level of Under-Secretary-General

not be full-time. He will be asked to come to New York in mid-
March to discuss the plan of action with the Secretary-General.

Vorontsov, 70, a former first deputy foreign minister, was
Moscow's representative at the United Nations from 1990 to 1994
and ambassador to Washington until early last year.
</P>
<P>
The post of U.N. coordinator for missing Kuwaitis and Kuwaiti
property was established according to a resolution of the United

<HEADLINE> Greece Urges Lifting of Sanctions Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Greece Monday stressed once
again the need for the gradually lifting of sanctions against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Defending Geeece's decision to ask for an end to the embargo on
Yugoslavia, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said that
Greece has done so because the situation in Yugoslavia has come to
an impasse with the policy being followed to date and the Yugoslav
people were carrying the burden.
</P>
<P>
During the weekend Balkan summit in Bucharest, Romania, Greek
Prime Minister Costas Simitis noted that the policy of isolating
Yugoslavia would bear little and the embargo should be re-
considered.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that the embargo on international flights into
Yugoslavia be gradually lifted and said that this mainly affects
the people of the country.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou also put forward the
proposal of ending the sanctions on Yugoslavia during the European
Union's General Affairs Council in Brussels Monday.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the sanctions on Yugoslavia because of the
problem in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, and currently flights
from EU member states to Belgrade are banned.

<P>
KAMPALA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has reassured people in the western district of
Bundibugyo that the government is determined to eliminate the
rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) very soon.
</P>

<P>
Accompanied by Chief of Staff of Uganda People's Defense

that their lives and properties are being protected by government
forces.
</P>
<P>
The government troops would be deployed in the Rwenzori
Mountains for a long time, he said. While the mobile forces are
tracking the ADF rebels in the mountains, other units of the UPDF
are cooperating closely to eliminate the bandits.
</P>
<P>
The president also assured the local residents that the
government would continue to provide food and other necessities
to those in need.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Uganda Injects More Money to Save Depreciating Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Uganda injected
another seven million U.S. dollars into the foreign exchange
market in its latest move to save the depreciating shilling from
falling further.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued Monday of the bank said that the latest
sale of foreign exchange would bring its intervention in the
market to a sum of 35. 2 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the current falling of shilling against
dollar is closely related to a sharp fall of coffee exports.
According to the latest Uganda Coffee Development Authority
report, coffee export earnings in January have dropped to 20.7
million dollars, a 46.2 percent drop compared with the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Prolonged drought in coffee-growing areas and the sweeping
coffee wilt, a coffee disease, as well as the low coffee prices
in international markets caused by a bumper harvest in Brazil are
blamed for Uganda's chronic shortage of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Other factors like the European Union's ban on Uganda's fish
exports and deteriorating security situation are also held
responsible for currency depreciation.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Uganda has tried to intervene in the foreign exchange
market since late last year when shilling began to lose value.
The bank would try its best to stabilize the market and monitor
its developments, the press release added.

<P>
Italy and Greece, which claim the labels soly belong to their
spirits and cannot be used by other countries, are opposed to
South Africa using grappa and ouzo to label its spirits. Their
opposition has put on hold the EU-South Africa trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
The EU said that under the agreement, the only products
allowed to be sold under denominations such as grappa and ouzo in
South Africa after five years would be originating in Europe.
</P>
<P>
In a separate declaration, the EU underlined that the
five-year transitional period would allow for either the
conclusion of a bilateral EU- South African accord on protecting
European geographical origins or of an international treaty within
the World Trade Organization on the issue.
</P>
<P>
If South Africa makes the pledge, Italy and Greece is expected
to ratify the EU-South African accord signed last October.
</P>
<P>
Both countries said earlier this year that they would not
ratify the EU- South Africa free trade agreement until the grappa
and ouzo disputes were solved.
</P>
<P>
Their stance cast doubts over implementation of the treaty by
EU customs officials.
</P>

South Africa has already agreed to phase out use of the terms
"port" and "sherry" on both its domestic and foreign markets in
response to European demands.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Refugees Face Critical Shortage of Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Angolan refugees in Western
province of Zambia are suffering from a critical shortage of
drugs, according to Zambia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Sinjembela refugee center has been hit with an outbreak of
malaria, dysentery, tinea fungous infection and connectives which
can not be treated due to lack of drugs.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF officer Paul Mutale who is in the area to offer medical
services said there drugs are needed as malaria and dysentery are
deadly.
</P>
<P>
Mutale said among the sick are frail old women, malnourished
babies, pregnant women and the amputees.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern on the non availability of family planning
centers at the refugee center and around the villages as most of
them have more than six little children each.
</P>
<P>
More than 4,000 refugees arrived at Sinjembela primary school
Sunday making the school congested with refugees.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Keli Walubika said the situation is out of
hand as the four block classroom can not accommodate the 4,000
plus refugees.
</P>
<P>
Classes at Sinjembela Primary School in Shangombo District of
the province have in the meantime been suspended because
classrooms and their surroundings have been occupied by Angolan
Refugees fleeing fighting between the government forces and the
rebels back home.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Walubita has bemoaned the shortage of
transport to transport the Angolan refugees around Sinjembela area
close to the border with Angola to the new refugee settlement at
Nangweshi.
</P>
<P>
 He appealed to the international donor community for
provision of food, medicine, shelter, water and sanitation to the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
 Addressing more than 500 Angolan refugees at Sinjembela
Primary School on Sunday Walubita told them of the Zambian
government's deepest sympathies over the happenings in their
Country resulting in them being displaced.
</P>
<P>
 He assured the refugees that the government would do every
thing possible to safeguard them while in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
 Walubita, however, regretted that only 1011 out of more than
14,000 refugees that are settled at the Sinjembela area have so
far been moved to the new refugee settlement because of transport
problems while the rest are languishing in forests and the plain
near the Zambian-Angolan border.

LONDON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Almost 180 peace activists were
arrested on Monday while attempting to blockade a nuclear
submarine base in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Some 400 activists from the anti-nuclear Trident-Ploughshares
group tried to block the entrance to the Faslane naval dockyard in
Scotland, where Britain's Trident nuclear submarines are based.
</P>
<P>
Police said those arrested were being held on minor public
order offenses. They said that at the end of the protest, which
was largely peaceful, between 150 and 180 people were held.
</P>
<P>
The protesters, who briefly set up a "peace camp" at Faslane,
west of Glasgow, maintain that Trident is in breach of
international, and hence British, law because it cannot
distinguish between military and civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
The Trident-Ploughshares group has mounted a series of protests
at Faslane, with activists occasionally breaking in to sabotage
equipment.

<HEADLINE> EU Forms NATO-Like Military Mechanism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union on Monday
decided to set up a NATO-like military mechanism composing of a
political committee and a military body.
</P>
<P>
The interim committee and body, to start working on March 1,
were the further concrete steps taken by the 15-nation bloc toward
the materialization of a common European Security and Defense
Identity (ESDI).
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the EU foreign ministers who met for a
two-day council meeting in Brussels that doubled up for the first
session of the inter-governmental conference aimed at EU internal
reforms.
</P>
<P>
The political committee, to be staffed by senior or
ambassadorial officials from EU member states, will prepare
recommendations on the future functioning of the common European
policy on security and defense while the military body, to be
staffed by military experts from the general staff of defense of
member states, will form the nucleus of the future military staff
of the ESDI.
</P>
<P>
The interim committees will work under the guidance of Javier
Solana, former NATO chief and now high representative of the union
's Common European Security and Defense Policy, until permanent
bodies of ESDI are established.
</P>
<P>
Within NATO, the political committee makes the decision while
the military committee makes recommendations on what options to
take by the political committee.
</P>
<P>
As another concrete step toward ESDI, the Western European
Union, the hitherto military branch of the European Union, is to
join NATO this week in a computer-generated military drill.
</P>
<P>
Code-named CMX/CRISEX 2000, the joint exercise is designed to
spot out what is in need and what can be improved in dealing with
real-life crises by the Europeans themselves using NATO assets and
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
The exercise will be carried out in the headquarters of the
Western European Union and NATO and no troops will be deployed
during the exercise lasting from February 17 to 23 to mimic a
peace support mission.

PARIS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The French Communist Party (PCF)
will adopt a pro-reform program at its 30th congress to be held at
the end of March, as most of its members have approved the
orientation of the congress given by PCF National Secretary Robert
Hue.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted PCF sources as saying that 80
percent of PCF members gave support to the main points of a
program to be adopted at the congress during a week-long debate.
</P>
<P>
The debate is focused on the reform of the leading organs of
the party, the analysis of the present situation of the Communist
movement, the analysis of the history of Socialist countries, and
the problem of globalization.
</P>
<P>
The PCF national secretary said on Sunday that the PCF needs a
great change and is having a ``real democratic and pacific
revolution''.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his hope that the congress will result in a
resolution on establishing a more open and flexible system of
admitting party members.
</P>
<P>
But he ruled out the possibility of changing the name of the
party.
</P>

BRUSSELS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union decided on
Monday to temporarily lift the flight ban on the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia for a period of six months.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the foreign ministers of the EU member

restrictions.
</P>

<HEADLINE> EU Concerned About Chechen Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union on Monday
expressed its concern about the "deteriorating humanitarian
situation" in Chechnya, especially in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the 15 EU nations stressed the urgent
need at their general affairs council to address the desperate
situation of civilians remaining in Grozny and the internally-
displaced personnel elsewhere in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
They condemned again the use of disproportionate and
indiscriminate force in Chechnya and repeated their concern about
civilian casualties and reminded Russia of the importance of
avoiding any spill-over of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The European Union called on the Russian authorities to take
the immediate steps toward a peaceful solution of the conflict in
Chechnya and toward the establishment of a cease-fire and the
opening of a political dialogue between the Russian government and
the Chechen representatives.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers expressed the union's readiness to
intensify its relief efforts in Chechnya as soon as the obstacles
to a speedy, efficient and safe delivery of aid to civilians are
removed.
</P>
<P>
They hoped that the assistance groups of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe can return to the region as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The Russian forces are now in control of Grozny but fights are
still continuing in the mountains where the Russian government
troops are closing in on the thousands of leftovers of the Chechen
separatists.

final document should be robust and concise, and should avoid what
happened at the end of" the U.N. conference to mark its 50th
anniversary in 1995, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the sideline of plenary sessions, two interactive
roundtable meetings will be held for the Heads of State and

<HEADLINE> Zambia Urges SADC to Join Hands in Curbing Car Thefts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Zambia on Monday appealed to
the member states of Southern African Development Community (SADC)
to strengthen cooperation in fighting against vehicle thefts.
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Minister Peter Machungwa made the appeal when
opening a conference on theft of motor vehicles, the first of its
kind in the sub- region.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to fight this motor vehicle theft scourge. We
 will fight till we vanquish it wherever it is to be found," he
told the participants from nine SADC member countries.
</P>
<P>
He also called for enacting tough laws dealing with vehicle
thefts, saying Botswana and Zimbabwe have already made such laws
while Zambian is drafting anti-vehicle-theft law.
</P>
<P>
He said theft of vehicles has reached alarming levels in the
region and in his country alone an average of five vehicles are
stolen every day.
</P>
<P>
Some thieves use weapons when they steal vehicles, killing or
wounding the occupants, he said.
</P>
<P>
The vehicle thefts are often linked to other serious crimes
such as drug trafficking, money laundering and smuggling of
firearms, posing threat to economy but bringing security
problems, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
"Criminals share intellegence amongst themselves and this is
what makes it difficult to break them, Consequently intellegence
sharing by police services in the sub-region as we collectively
roll our sleeves against transnational criminals is extremely
important," the minister said.

MAPUTO, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique is about to launch a
gigantic road construction and maintenance program with a total
investment of three billion U.S. dollars mainly from the World
Bank and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
According to Monday's issue of newssheet "Metical", the
project, named ROAD III, is scheduled to be completed in 10 ten
year. Half of the investment will be spent on new construction and
the other half will go on maintenance.
</P>
<P>
The Metical warned that that most of the benefits will go to
foreign consultants and contractors. It opposed sing World Bank
loans (which may be soft loans and Mozambique must still
eventually repay) to hire yet more foreign consultants.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank is insisting on outside consultants, while most
members of the Mozambican National Road Administration believe
that, since the road policy and strategies already exist, further
consultancies would be redundant.
</P>
<P>
But the World Bank wants a consultancy on environmental
questions, and another on the administration and financial
management for all the project.

ADDIS ABABA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian religious
communities set up a committee on Monday to coordinate their
efforts in curbing the spread of HIV/AIDS in the country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the founding workshop of the coordinating committee,
senior official of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church Mekonen Meshesha
said that religious institutions were duty-bound to save the
generation from the threat of the pandemic.

public awareness on the disease, he said.
</P>
<P>
HIV/AIDS has become one of the major killer diseases in
Ethiopia in recent years. About three million Ethiopians have been
infected with HIV, the virus which causes AIDS, and 400,000 are
estimated to have gone ill, according to the Health Ministry.

<HEADLINE> OAU Chief Urges Restoration of Democracy in Cote d'Ivoire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim has urged
the leaders of the transitional government of Cote d'Ivoire to
restore democratic rule in the country as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Salim made the appeal when he met Christophe M'boua, special
envoy of General Robert Guei, chairman of the transitional
government of Cote d' Ivoire, on Saturday, an OAU press release
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
M'boua, also minister of external affairs of Cote d'Ivoire,
briefed Salim on the developments and circumstance that brought
General Guei to power.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed the OAU chief on the transitional arrangements
put in place to ensure an early return to constitutional rule, the
release said.
</P>
<P>
In response, Salim expressed surprise and regret over the coup
d'etat that took place in Cote d'Ivoire in December, given that
the country had always believed in and practised tolerance and
dialogue since the days of President Houphet Boigny.
</P>
<P>
Salim recalled the Algiers Decisions on unconstitutional
changes of government, especially, the decision by the Assembly of
Heads of State and Government, not to accept any longer in their
midst, any leader that came to power through a coup d'etate and
other unconstitutional means.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the release added, the OAU chief informed the
Ivorian special envoy that the OAU will continue to encourage the
government of General Guei to move speedily towards the
restoration of democratic governance in Cote d'Ivore.
</P>
<P>
A group of soldiers, led by former chief of general staff Guei,
toppled Henri Konan Bedie and his government on Christmas Eve last
year.
</P>
<P>
Hours after the coup happened, Salim said in a statement that
he learnt with "great dismay and consternation" of the development
in Cote d'Ivoire, and called for the immediate restoration of law
and order in the country.

<HEADLINE> Angola Urges S.Africa Not Interfering its Internal Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dos Santos made the remarks after a meeting with his Namibian
counterpart Sam Nujoma, who is in Angola for a several-hour visit
discuss the current situation along the border of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan president said, "I think that it is wise for the
South African leaders to worry about their internal problems and
leave Angola in peace."
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos' speech is considered by Angop as a response to
suggestions of some South African leaders to negotiate with the
rebel National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
South African leaders should pay more attention to the rampant
crimes and extreme poverty existing in their country's suburban
areas, not to the Angolan internal affairs, said the Angolan
president.
</P>
<P>
On the situation along the common border between Angola and
Namibia, Dos Santos said that there aren't many Savimbists in the
area. "There are only small (rebel) groups that attack the civil
population," said the president, adding that "some of them are
suffering hunger".
</P>
<P>
After the summit, Nujoma reiterated his full support for the
Angolan government's efforts to beat Savimbists and restore peace
in the southwest African country.
</P>
<P>
"The Namibian troops will stay in the Namibian territory,"
stressed Nujoma, adding that "the annihilation of the Savimbists
is purely a responsibility of the Armed Forces of Angola (FAA).
</P>
<P>
Due to the deteriorating situation in the Angolan-Namibian
bordering areas, the U.S. government has decided to pull out all
the U.S. citizens and enterprises from the region.

<HEADLINE> Barak Opposes Immediate Withdrawal from Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak reiterated Monday that he opposes an immediate unilateral
withdrawal from south Lebanon in spite of the heavy casualties
Israel suffered in a border zone there.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to members of his One Israel parliamentary bloc, Barak
said Israel should be given a chance for peace talks with Lebanon
and its main power broker Syria before leaving Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Also, Israel should send a message of steadfastness to the
world, rather than slink out of Lebanon, at a time when tension was
escalating between Israeli soldiers and Hezbollah guerrillas in the
security zone, he said.
</P>
<P>
Barak made the appeal as public pressure was mounting for an
immediate withdrawal from Lebanon in the wake of the killings of
seven Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah guerillas in less than three
weeks in the border zone Israel carved out in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Barak has promised to pull Israeli troops out of the border zone
by July this year, preferably through negotiations with Syria. The
latest escalation there and the impasse on the talks with Syria,
however, have led to rising calls in Israel for an immediate
unilateral withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary Speaker Avraham Burg joined the call Monday,
saying Barak should order a withdrawal immediately to cut
casualties in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But Barak sticks to his position that he prefers a withdrawal
under the framework of a peace agreement with Syria. He has said on
several occasions in the last few days that there would be no troop
withdrawal in at least two months.
</P>
<P>
He told a cabinet meeting Sunday that if by April or May there
is no agreement on the horizon, then he will make a decision on
whether to move up the promised deadline.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Israeli public to stand firm before that period
because it would take a few months to explore every chance of
achieving an agreement with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks, which resumed last December after a
four-year freeze, broke off last month following a dispute between
the two sides over the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Syria wanted the talks to focus on a full Israeli withdrawal
from the Golan Heights, seized by Israel in the 1967 war, while
Israel wanted to talk about security arrangements first.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister David Levy Monday denied media reports in and
outside Israel that the Israeli-Syrian talks would be resumed soon,
saying Syria should rein in Hezbollah activities against Israel
first.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Accepts Trust Building Measures Conditionally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot government stressed
Monday that it would be willing to discuss confidence building
measures on the island as long as they would not lead to the
recognition of the breakaway regime in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
However, government spokesman Michalis Papapetrou said in his
daily press briefing that no concrete measures have been proposed
to the government in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing has been brought before the government in a concrete
and official way," he said.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou reiterated that such measures "could be discussed
only if they do not lead to recognition of the illegal regime in
the Turkish areas and as a process that would back efforts for a
settlement."
</P>
<P>
He said that discussion on confidence building measures "cannot
be a substitute" to efforts towards a solution to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Since then the United Nations has been trying to bring the two
sides back together through a bizonal, bicommunal federation
formula.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a republic
in northern Cyprus, which is recognized only by Turkey. The Turkish
Cypriot side refused to enter direct talks with Nicosia unless
their regime was recognized by the international community.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of U.N.-sponsored proximity talks between the Greek
and Turkish Cypriot sides were held in the past months, during
which the two sides contacted through U.N. officials shuttling
between them. The talks were aimed at paving the way for
substantial negotiations.
</P>
<P>
A third round of talks is scheduled to begin at the U.N.
headquarters in New York on May 23.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. announced last month an agreement on restoration of two
important religious sites, one in the government-controlled Greek
Cypriot area and the other in the Turkish Cypriot area.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that the two communities gave green light
to the restoration of significant sites on their territories of the
opposite side's religion. The agreement was welcomed as a step
toward building trust between the two sides.

<HEADLINE> Haider Does Not Speak for Austria: Austrian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Austrian foreign minister
on Monday assured worrying European Union nations that who they
feared most did not speak for her country.
</P>
<P>
Benita Ferrero-Waldner said after attending the EU council of
foreign ministers that only three Austrian officials are entitled
by the constitution to represent the country internationally and
they are the federal president, federal chancellor and foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Europe will listen to those who are entitled to
speak for Austria and not to the word of a Carinthean governor,"
said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Joerg Haider, whose far-right Freedom Party has joined the
conservative People's Party in the coalition government and thus
raised havoc in the EU, is the governor of the Austrian state of
Carinthia.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian foreign minister said that Haider is not a member
of the coalition government and that the key government posts
regarding EU enlargement are in the hands of the People's Party.
</P>
<P>
The incorporation of Haider's extreme party into the coalition
government inflicted strong reactions in the 15-nation bloc.
Austria's 14 EU partners have threatened to isolate the country
since the swear-in of the coalition government on February 6.
</P>
<P>
But the 14 have agreed to continue working relations with
Austria within the EU.
</P>
<P>
Haider and his far-right party have been criticized for their
non-tolerant and xenophobic approach and were feared for hindering
the enlargement process into the east and south.
</P>
<P>
Austria borders four of the 12 applicant countries seeking EU
membership.
</P>
<P>
"Austrians are European patriots who need the European Union
but the European Union needs Austria too," said Fererro-Waldner
whose meeting with her counterparts was the first formal meeting
between an Austrian cabinet member and her or his EU equivalents
after the swear-in.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian foreign minister asked for EU understanding and
asked Austria's EU partners to judge her country on the basis of
the actions of the coalition government.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 14 (Xinhua) -- General Secretary of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam Le Kha Phieu asserted
that Vietnam always treasures the traditional Vietnam-Russia
friendship.
</P>
<P>
Phieu made the remarks when he was receiving the visiting
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Phieu thanked the people of the Russian
Federation and other countries in the former Soviet Union for
their valuable assistance to the Vietnamese people's struggle for
national liberation.
</P>

He expressed hope for the further strengthening of the
traditional friendship and cooperation in the new period to meet
aspirations and fundamental interests of the two nations and for
peace, stability and development in Asia and the world.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov highly regarded the traditional friendship and
cooperation between Russia and Vietnam as strategic cooperation
which, he said, not only benefits the two nations but also
contributes to strengthening peace, stability and cooperation in
the Asia-Pacific Region and the world.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov thanked Vietnam for its support for Russia's anti-
terrorism struggle to protect territorial integrity and fight
against the attempt of weakening and isolating Russia in the world.
</P>

Earlier the same day, Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen
Manh Cam also received Ivanov and his party here.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Japan Discuss Joint Navy Exercise on High Seas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This was the first official visit by a high-ranking Japanese
navy officer to Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union in
1991.
</P>
<P>
"It is easier for navymen to come to understanding as we have
to cope with the same tasks on high seas," Kuroyedov said.
</P>
<P>
He said he proposed to the Japanese colleague to consider the
possibility of establishing a hotline between Russia's Pacific
Fleet and Japan's navy.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that the presently operating agreements and
memoranda of the two countries also deal with naval themes,
including peacemaking and humanitarian trends.
</P>
<P>
Admiral Kosei Fujita expressed hope that Japanese warships
could call not only at the base of the Pacific Fleet in
Vladivostok, but also at other Russian ports.
</P>
<P>
Kuroyedov said complete coincidence of positions on the
strengthening of mutual understanding in the Asia-Pacific region
had been achieved during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Japan have accumulated the experience of such
exercises since 1997. The two countries have held several joint
maneuvers off their coasts during a series of bilateral official
visits by naval vessels and their units.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Business Inventories and Sales Rise in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In November, business inventories surged by a sizable 1 percent
as companies prepared for the holidays and for the Year 2000
computer changeover.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, December's sales rose by a strong 1.1 percent,
following a brisk 1.5 percent gain the month before.
</P>
<P>
The increase in December's sales brought the inventory-to-sales
ratio to a record low of 1.32, meaning it would take 1.32 months
to exhaust inventories at the December sales pace.
</P>
<P>
Since those rate increases have raised borrowing costs for
businesses and consumers, many analysts believe the economy is
growing too rapidly, a pace that probably can't be sustained
without triggering inflation down the road.
</P>
<P>
Given that, many analysts believe the Federal Reserve will
boost rates again in March.

<HEADLINE> EU, European Parliament Meet to Discuss Internal Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
member states and the European Parliament met on Monday to kick
off the inter-governmental conference (IGC) intended to review and
discuss internal reforms for the 15-nation EU.
</P>
<P>
The conference, proposed by the European Union summit meetings
last June and December, will meet throughout the year at different
levels.
</P>
<P>
It will first examine proposals put forward during last year's
summit meetings at Cologne and Helsinki before identifying issues
to be discussed at the IGC.
</P>
<P>
As first attendants of the conference, the foreign ministers of
the EU member states will touch upon the subject of majority
voting at the current session which ends on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The EU has been undergoing external and internal reforms. The
on-going external reform is focused mainly on its enlargement
toward the east and south of Europe, while the internal reform
will be demonstrated mainly via the change of its voting mechanism
and the modification of the treaties of the union.
</P>
<P>
Up till now, decisions concerning EU-wide issues could only be
made with a unanimity, while reformists have been demanding a
majority voting mechanism that makes decisions through a qualified
majority among the 15 member bloc.

<HEADLINE> Far-Right Party Boss Cancels Meeting Trip to Brussels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Joerg Haider, whose party is
joining the Austrian coalition government and has created havoc in
the European Union, has canceled a trip to the EU capital.
</P>
<P>
The trip was originally scheduled for a Thursday meeting of the
EU's committee of regions, but it was canceled when the chief of
Austria's far-right Freedom Party said he had been invited to
attend "another more important international meeting."
</P>
<P>
Opponents and critics of the Austrian extreme rightist said it
could be a diplomatic excuse for Haider's cancellation of the trip.
Haider is the governor of the Austrian state of Carinthie.
</P>
<P>
Vincent Dewolf, chief administrator of Brussels' Etterbeek
district, where the EU committee of regions is seated, has clearly
expressed that Haider should not come to the meeting because
opponents are organizing anti-Haider demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Belgium and France are hardline opponents of incorporating far-
right governments into any EU government.
</P>
<P>
Belgian and French social affairs ministers openly snubbed
their Austrian counterpart last Friday during an informal European
council of ministers.
</P>
<P>
Belgian foreign minister Louis Michel reiterated that his
country's intention is to not have any bilateral relations with
the new Austrian coalition government which was formed by the
conservative People's Party and the far-right Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
Austria's 14 EU partners have threatened to isolate the country
since the swearing-in of the coalition government in Vienna on
February 6.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian foreign minister said that it would be the biggest
mistake to forgive the formation of the coalition with the far-
right. "The drift is very serious," said Michel.
</P>
<P>
Haider's Freedom Party has been criticized for its non-tolerant
and xenophobic approach. Austria's EU partners are afraid that
the incorporation of the far-right into the Austrian coalition
government could hinder the process of the union's enlargement.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Regulator Looks Into Price Complaints on Microsoft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland's price regulator
is investigating pricing practices by the United States software
group, Microsoft, following complaints by consumer groups that
prices in Europe are higher than in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the price regulator, Werner Marti, said that
the price for the Windows 98 operating system and the Office 97
Professional productivity software suite showed there were "
effectively significant price differences to the disadvantage of
Swiss consumers," according to Swiss Radio International Monday.
The regulator added that this was also the case for Office 2000.
</P>
<P>
"We've done some Internet research and we see that there is a
tendency for prices to be higher in Europe than in the U.S.,"
Marti told Swiss Radio International. "There are also some
differences between European countries, with Swiss prices higher
too."
</P>
<P>
Marti said it was difficult to say at this stage if the
pricing differences were justified by higher costs in Switzerland,
but he warned Microsoft "If the prices are artificially high and
there are no reasons for it, we have a price surveillance act and
we can ask Microsoft to lower prices."
</P>
<P>
Marti could not say when his inquiry would be completed but
confirmed that it was among his priorities for the year. The
price regulator is a state official with the power to intervene in
cases of pricing disputes.
</P>
<P>
The announcement might be another blow to Microsoft which is
already the subject of anti-trust investigations by the U.S.
Justice Department and the European Union.

JERUSALEM -- Israeli State Attorney Edna Arbel said Monday that
the police probe into President Ezer Weizman's alleged financial
irregularities is to close with no charge being considered at the
present time.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing investigation over allegation that Weizman had
accepted a large sum of cash gifts from a French millionaire will
wind up "in a matter of days," according to Israel Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
Arbel confirmed that she will make a decision on the case soon
after police investigators present their evidence and conclusion
of the probe to her office.
</P>
<P>
Based on the updates she received from the investigation team,
Arbel said that she didn't think there would be any criminal
indictment.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel's Army Radio quoted Arbel as saying that she
and Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein will likely compile a
summary report on the matter after further discussions. (Israel-

BRUSSELS -- NATO Secretary General George Robertson on Monday
warned rioters in Kosovo that the alliance-led international

Robertson said that KFOR will not tolerate attacks on its
forces by anyone and that the robust response of KFOR soldiers is
only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to NATO's determination
to protect its forces and stop the perpetrators of violence in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Two French peacekeepers were wounded in gunfire that killed two
people and wounded 11 others in the northern Kosova town of
Kosovska Mitrovica, where KFOR troops arrested 39 ethnic Albanians
and one Serb for the violence over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Describing the violence against the international peacekeepers
as "a shameful and cowardly act," the NATO chief said that he
would remind all parties in Kosovo that it was NATO that had been
working toward restoring peace and stability for all ethnic groups
in Kosovo.

JERUSALEM -- Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy Monday denied
media reports that Israeli-Syrian talks would be resumed soon,
saying Israel will not resume the talks at any price.
</P>
<P>
"There is no calming (in southern Lebanon) and there is no
renewal of the relations," Levy told Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Levy was responding to reports on the influential Arab
newspaper al-Hayat published in London that U.S. President Bill
Clinton would soon issue a call to Israel and Syria to resume the
talks in the wake of the latest military escalation in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister blamed Syria for the latest impasse in the
talks, saying Damascus took "one step forward and two steps back"
in the process. He dismissed the reports on the resumption of
talks as Syrian "media games."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks, which resumed last December after a
four-year freeze, broke off in January over a dispute on the fate
of the Golan Heights, a Syrian plateau seized by Israel in the
1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
Syria accused Israel of refusing to focus on the return of the
Golan Heights in the first two rounds of talks, insisting that
Israel make a written commitment to a full withdrawal from the
heights before the talks could be reopened. Israel rejected the
demand. (Israel-Syria-Talks)

billion RS ( 4.58 billion U.S. dollars) in 2000, leaving a budget

<HEADLINE> hke021479 --Further Dialogue on Linkages of WTO Urged at UNCTAD X </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Some NGO activists urged here
Monday that further dialogues and consensus building should be
promoted in the issues of linking labor or environmental standards
within the sanctioned based mechanism of the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The linkage may "harm the development prospects of the third
world countries," some non-governmental organization (NGO)
activists agreed at a panel discussion organized as a part of the
parallel NGO events during the 10th session of the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD X), which lasts from
February 12 to 19.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the discussion was to facilitate the process
of dialogue between the protagonists and antagonists of the
linkages in the sanctioned based discipline of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 participants from civil society and media along with
the government delegates to UNCTAD X took part in the discussion.
</P>
<P>
Professor Yash Tandon of International South Group Network
asserted that because of the inherent lacunae in the WTO system,
it is not the right authority to handle environmental or labor
issues.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that such linkages may be brought within more
transparent and democratic institutions, such as UNCTAD or the
International Labor Organization (ILO).
</P>
<P>
Miloon Kothari of International Coalition of Human Rights
Institution on Trade and Investment of New Delhi said that
fundamental human rights concerns have been undermined by the
process of trade liberalization, warning that trade liberalization
is not an end in itself, hence WTO should not be given more powers.

<HEADLINE> Central Banks' Independence Means to Fight  Corruption: Supachai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Independence of the central
monetary authority is crucial to the fighting against corruption,
Supachai Panitchpakdi, president of the 10th Session of the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD X), said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with representatives of non-governmental
organizations (NGOs), Supachai, Thailand's deputy prime minister
and commerce minister, gave four suggestions as ways to fight
against corruption and achieve good governance.
</P>
<P>
He said efforts should be made to ensure the independence of
the central banks so that they can be liberal and not be
influenced by governments to undertake any moral hazards, which
was part of the lessons of the financial crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested to include in constitutions national
committees set up by parliaments to work on anti-corruption
campaign.
</P>
<P>
"The committees should be set up only by parliaments on
national basis," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The third prescription he gave is the establishment of an
international standard like those being done in the financial
system.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he suggested international codes of conduct be set up
for various crucial practices, most importantly in the banking
system.
</P>
<P>
He also called for disclosing information in accounts, book-
keeping and financial reports as much as possible to allow the
public a peep to see what is really being done.

<HEADLINE> Globalization Brings Chances, Challenges: Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong said Monday that globalization has brought about both
opportunities and serious challenges to the world.
</P>
<P>
"It is now clear that there are as many challenges as
opportunities after the Cold War," said Goh in a speech delivered
at a dinner hosted in honor of visiting United Nations Secretary-
General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
While globalization benefits those countries which can seize
its opportunities, Goh said, it also evokes a sense of
helplessness and loss of control for those who cannot.
</P>
<P>
"Globalization and technology that has contributed to a more
integrated world economy both pose serious dilemmas for many," he
said.
</P>
<P>
While globalization and technology have brought unprecedented
prosperity to many countries, they have also marginalized the weak
and the less developed, Goh said.
</P>
<P>
He said there is a risk that some countries which cannot adapt
to change may be marginalized permanently.
</P>
<P>
"A world permanently divided into the prosperous few and the
marginalized many will be unstable," he warned.
</P>
<P>
An integrated world economy does not automatically bring about
a politically integrated world and the ultimate issues are basic
questions of conflict and security, he said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has always played an active role in aiding
the development of the Third World, but the challenge today is "
qualitatively different," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the UN secretary general who arrived in
Singapore Sunday night for a three-day visit had a meeting with
Goh.
</P>
<P>
Annan also met with President S.R. Nathan, Senior Minister Lee
Kuan Yew and Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar.
</P>
<P>
He also delivered the 18th Singapore Lecture on "Global values-
the United Nations and the rule of law in the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials said that the visit is part of a two-week tour
of Asia and the Pacific to emphasize the need to involve ordinary
people in the debate on globalization.
</P>
<P>
Annan is scheduled to leave Singapore for Jakarta on Tuesday to
meet with Indonesian leaders before visiting East Timor.

<HEADLINE> Ghana's Goldfields Company Appoints Acting Board Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's troubled Ashanti
Goldfields Company (Ashanti), once the largest foreign exchange
earner for the country, Monday appointed senior independent
director Philip M. Tarsh as Acting Chairman of its Board of
Directors with immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
The move followed the resignation of Finance Minister Richard
Kwame Peprah as director of the company and chairman of the board
on February 11, the Ghana News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement from Ashanti in Accra, Tarsh who has
been a member of the Board since 1978, will serve as acting
chairman of the company until a new chairman is appointed.
</P>
<P>
The Ghanaian government owns the golden share of 20 percent in
the company which had been in deep trouble since late last year
when its hedging policy backfired.
</P>
<P>
Creditors moved on the company and many crisis meetings were
held in Accra and London to bail out the company.
</P>
<P>
Four shareholders took the company to court and obtained a
ruling asking for an Emergency General Meeting of shareholders to
elect a new board of directors.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Peprah resigned from his office because he
was unable to continue his role in face of pressures of
implementing the challenging targets set in the budget.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Former Chadian President Hissene
Habre, who is charged by judicial authorities in Senegal for
allegedly committing crimes against humanity, has accused France
and Libya of staging a "plot" against him.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the French weekly Jeune Afrique, published
on Monday, Habre said that the charges made against him "reveal a
gross campaign of slander aimed at ... discrediting totally what I
have consecrated my life to doing -- serving the Chadian people."
</P>
<P>
Habre, who was president of Chad from 1982 till 1990, said that
"no opposer, more or less known, was executed, jailed or tortured
during the time we were in power."
</P>
<P>
The Senegalese judicial authorities opened an inquiry on
January 27 against Habre for "crimes against humanity" and "acts
of torture."
</P>
<P>
Several international organizations on human rights, including
the Paris-based International Federation of the League of Human
Rights, have accused Habre of being responsible for executing more
than 40,000 people and torturing more than 200,000 others during
his rule in Chad.
</P>
<P>
"All that is a dirty plot woven against me. My being alive and
free continues to hurt many people, to begin with my deadly enemy,
Gaddafi, and his allies in the reactionary and neo-colonialist
circles in France," said Habre.
</P>
<P>
He said that France and Libya "are working in close
collaboration" linked by "the financial and petrol interests."
</P>
<P>
Chad and Libya fought a war in the 1980s, during which France
launched the "Epervier" military operation in Chad to help Habre.

<HEADLINE> EU to Send More Police to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
decided on Monday to send 400 more policemen to Kosovo, where a
violent weekend incident has caused two deaths and several
injuries, including two international peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by EU foreign ministers during the EU
council meeting at the demand of Javier Solana, who is now in
charge of the EU's Common European Security and Defense Policy.
</P>
<P>
After Sunday's gunfight in the northwestern Kosovar town of
Kosovska Mitrovica, Solana spoke with the U.N. administrator in
Kosovo and the chief of the international peacekeeping force
before appealing to the foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
Five of the 15 EU member states -- Spain, Britain, Sweden,
Denmark, Austria and Germany -- have already contributed police
forces to the U.N.-led international police task force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-led police force was expected to have 4,718 policemen
and policewomen, but it so far has only 2,055.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, two French peacekeepers were wounded in a gunfight
that killed two and wounded 11 others. The international
peacekeeping KFOR troops later arrested 39 ethnic Albanians and
one Serb.
</P>
<P>
The arrested were suspected of sniping and handling illegal
weapons.
</P>
<P>
The French peacekeepers earlier detained one ethnic Albanian
sniper, who slipped into the Serb-dominated part of town and shot
at the international peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
Kosovska Mitrovica has been a trouble spot for the
international peacekeepers since they moved in last June to
separate ethnic Albanians and Serbs who live in a town divided by
a river.

WASHINGTON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- A northern corner of Mitrovica, an ethnically divided town
in Yugoslavia, became a war zone on Sunday as snipers shot and
wounded two French peacekeepers. French troops responded by later
killing an ethnic Albanian and wounding at least four others.
</P>
<P>
-- More than 100 years after the last of their colonies won
independence, Spain is back in Latin America -- doing with mergers
and acquisitions what it once did with swords and gunpowder.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- French troops killed an Albanian gunman Sunday during fierce
fighting in the streets of Mitrovica, Kosovo in the most sustained
clashes involving peacekeeping troops since they arrived in Kosovo
eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
-- The National Transportation Safety Board said that a part of
the tail assembly on the Alaska Airlines jet that crashed January
31 had been found to be worn and in need of replacement in
September 1997, but that the airline later decided it was good
enough to keep in use.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp., the world's two
biggest auto companies are about to enter a bidding war for the
insolvent South Korean car maker Daewoo Motor -- and the outcome
could determine who will be No. 1.

<HEADLINE> HK Sees Further Increase in Retail Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's year-on-year
growth in the volume of retail sales increased further in December
1999, according to the provisional figures on retail sales
released today by the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
The value of total retail sales in December 1999, estimated at
16.6 billion HK dollars (2.13 billion U.S. dollars), decreased by
two percent compared with a year earlier. But after discounting
the effect of price changes over the period, there was a notable
increase of six percent in volume, further up from the five
percent increase in November.
</P>
<P>
Analyzed by type of retail outlet and on a year-on-year
comparison, sales volume of most categories of consumer goods
increased in December 1999.
</P>
<P>
Sales of furniture and fixtures registered the largest increase,
by 16 percent in volume, followed by sales of commodities in
department stores and in supermarkets, both by 14 percent in
volume.
</P>
<P>
Sales of wearing apparel likewise recorded a double-digit
increase of 11 percent in volume. Sales volume of other consumer
durable goods rose by eight percent, of footwear, allied products
and other clothing accessories by seven percent, and of fuels by
six percent.
</P>
<P>
On a seasonally adjusted basis, the volume of total retail
sales in the three months ending December 1999 increased by one
percent over that in the three months ending September 1999.
</P>
<P>
For 1999 as a whole, total retail sales decreased by eight
percent in value or two percent in volume. Yet this already
represented a distinct improvement from the 17 percent decline in
both value and volume in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Analyzed by type of retail outlet, sales volume of furniture
and fixtures and of other consumer durable goods posted the
largest increases, both by six percent, followed by the three
percent increase in sales volume of wearing apparel.
</P>
<P>
Sales volume of food, alcoholic drinks and tobacco and of
commodities in supermarkets both resumed a small growth of two
percent, while sales volume of commodities in department stores
also revived to a one-percent increase.
</P>
<P>
A Government Secretariat spokesman noted that there was a
distinct turnaround in performance of retail business over the
course of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The broad-based revival in retail sales reflected the continued
strengthening in consumer demand as the economy rebounded, while
the prevalence of price discounts also helped, he said.

191.34 points, or 1.10 percent, at 17,188.96 today, after hitting
a record high on the previous trading session.
</P>
<P>

property and utility shares after the interest rates increase by

</P>
<P>
Felled by a potential bidding by the Pacific Century Cyberworks
Ltd and Singapore Telecommunications Ltd, Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT
jumped 4.75 HK dollars (61 U.S. cents), or 21.9 percent, to be 26.
40 HK dollars (3.38 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Today's turnover was 28.242 billion HK dollars (3.621 billion U.
S. dollars), down 4.641 billion HK dollars (595 million U.S.
dollars) from the 32.883 billion HK dollars (4.216 billion U.S.
dollars) on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Of the four sub-indices, only Commerce and Industry registered
rise of 0.91 percent, while Finance, Utilities and Properties fell
significantly by 2.92 percent, 4.53 percent and 4.06 percent.
</P>
<P>

Enterprises Index down 4.60 percent and Hang Seng China-Affiliated

<HEADLINE> Province Shocked By News of Son Who Kills His Mother </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The murder of a mother by her
17 year old son because he couldn't take deal with pressure from
school has sent shocking waves throughout Zhejiang province.
</P>
<P>
Xu Li, a second-year student from the Fourth Middle School in
the city of Jinhua, lived with his mother, Wu Fengxian who worked
at a local food company. Xu's father works in a railway station
far away and is rarely at home.
</P>
<P>
Wu Fengxian was very strict with her son in the hope that he
would have a bright future. She purportedly told her son who
failed his latest exam,that if he continued to play football and
not concentrate on his studies, she would break his legs.
</P>
<P>
On January 17, Xu threw a hammer at his mother during a bitter
quarrel which fatally killed her. Xu Li concealed the body and
left a note for his father on the table saying that his mother had
gone to see doctor in Hangzhou, the provincial capital. Xu
returned to school as if nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
Many of Xu's classmates and teachers were shocked at the news
since Xu was kind and gentle as well as hard working.
</P>
<P>
Under the current educational system, students are placed under
enormous pressure to score high marks that will get them into a
prestigious university or college and eventually an ideal job.
</P>
<P>
Many parents place exceptionally high hopes on their children.
In cities, most couples have only one child. Consequently,
schoolchildren are under constant pressure to perform from both
school teachers and parents.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua News Agency published a commentary today on the tragedy,
stating that urgent measures must be taken to deal with the
pressure that school children encounter at school and home despite
the fact that the government has tried to reduce the homework load
for students.

<HEADLINE> Probe Against Weizman to End, No Charge at Present </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli State Attorney Edna
Arbel said Monday that the police probe into President Ezer
Weizman's alleged financial irregularities is to close with no
charge being considered at the present time.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing investigation over allegation that Weizman had
accepted a large sum of cash gifts from a French millionaire will
wind up "in a matter of days," according to Israel Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
Arbel confirmed that she will make a decision on the case soon
after police investigators present their evidence and conclusion of
the probe to her office.
</P>
<P>
Based on the updates she received from the investigation team,
Arbel said that she didn't think there would be any criminal
indictment.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel's Army Radio quoted Arbel as saying that she and
Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein will likely compile a summary
report on the matter after further discussions.
</P>
<P>
Weizman was charged by investigative journalist Yoav Yitzhak at
the end of last year with receiving about 453,000 U.S. dollars as "
cash gifts" from French millionaire businessman Edouard Saroussi
between 1988 and 1993, when he was a Knesset (Parliament) member
and a cabinet minister.
</P>
<P>
Weizman admitted that he had received money from Saroussi, but
less than the alleged sum and Saroussi gave him the money as a
personal gift with no political or business purpose.
</P>
<P>
Arbel and Rubinstein launched the criminal investigation against
Weizman last month after a special police team presented them "
alleged evidence of a relationship of business" between Weizman and
Saroussi.
</P>
<P>
The probe was the first of its kind against a reigning president
in Israel's 52-year history.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police questioned Weizman twice in the past days, and
Saroussi at his residence in Geneva, Switzerland on a two-day
period last week, trying to determine the nature of the financial
transactions between the two persons.
</P>
<P>
Weizman's wife Reuma, his top aide and Director-General of his
office Aryeh Shumer, his lawyer Hanina Brandes, who managed the
president's accounts related to Saroussi's money, and acquaintances
of the president had also been questioned.
</P>
<P>
Some legal experts once worried that the investigation will lead
to allegations against Weizman over tax evasion, crimes against the
law of state service regarding the receiving of gifts, and failing
to report money received in his declaration of capital as a member
of Knesset.
</P>
<P>
But they also pointed out that even when evidence seems to
indicate that a crime has been committed, no legal steps will be
taken against the president as he enjoys immunity from criminal
prosecution under the Basic Law of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Weizman dismissed widespread rumors that he would resign or at
least step aside temporarily from his highly ceremonial post in a
dramatic televised speech to the whole country last month, saying
that he did nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
Elected president in 1993 and re-elected in 1998, the 75-year-
old Weizman was viewed as one of the most outspoken and popular
politicians in Israel. The fighter-turned-peacemaker is firmly
committed to supporting the peace talks with Arab countries. He
will end his second term as president in 2003, if not resign
because of the investigation.

<HEADLINE> Levy Denies Israeli-Syrian Talks to Be Resumed Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy Monday denied media reports that Israeli-Syrian talks
would be resumed soon, saying Israel will not resume the talks at
any price.
</P>
<P>
"There is no calming (in southern Lebanon) and there is no
renewal of the relations," Levy told Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Levy was responding to reports on the influential Arab newspaper
al-Hayat published in London that U.S. President Bill Clinton would
soon issue a call to Israel and Syria to resume the talks in the
wake of the latest military escalation in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister blamed Syria for the latest impasse in the
talks, saying Damascus took "one step forward and two steps back"
in the process. He dismissed the reports on the resumption of talks
as Syrian "media games."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks, which resumed last December after a
four-year freeze, broke off in January over a dispute on the fate
of the Golan Heights, a Syrian plateau seized by Israel in the 1967
Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
Syria accused Israel of refusing to focus on the return of the
Golan Heights in the first two rounds of talks, insisting that
Israel make a written commitment to a full withdrawal from the
heights before the talks could be reopened. Israel rejected the
demand.
</P>
<P>
There have been various reports in Israel in the last several
days also saying that the talks would be resumed soon.
</P>
<P>
The local daily Maariv said Friday that Israel and Syria had
agreed in principle to revive talks within two weeks. Israel army
radio said Monday that Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Shareh has
sent a message to French diplomats signaling Damascus wants to
renew the negotiations soon.
</P>
<P>
But Levy repeated the Israeli position that Israel would not
resume the talks according to Syrian conditions.
</P>
<P>
Israel has appealed to Syria, the main power in Lebanon, to rein
in Hezbollah guerrillas who have dealt a series of blows to the
Israeli army in a border zone in southern Lebanon in the last three
weeks. Seven Israeli soldiers were killed during the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak has refrained from launching a severe
military retaliation against Lebanon in an apparent effort to avoid
ruining the chance of resuming the talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, hundreds of Druze Arabs at the village of Majdal
Shams on the Golan Heights held demonstrations demanding Israel
leave the Golan. The protesters threw stones at Israeli police, who
fired tear gas in return.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for More International Pressure on Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Monday urged the
international community to exert more pressure on Israel to stop
its week-long air strikes on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The international community, especially the Organization of the
Islamic Conference (OIC), must continue efforts to halt Israeli
attacks on Lebanese non-military targets, said Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that Iranian President Mohammed
Khatami, as the incumbent OIC chairman, has sent letters to heads
of Islamic countries to denounce Israel's recent air raids on
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Islamic countries have responded positively to
Khatami's letters, especially to his call to help Lebanese
government in reconstructing the damaged regions, Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
Israel launched a series of air strikes on Lebanese civilian
installations and suspected Hezbollah targets in the past week to
avenge the attacks by pro-Iranian Hezbollah guerrillas. The Israeli
raids were widely condemned by Islamic countries.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that Iran will continue its contacts with the U.N.
and the Lebanese-Israeli ceasefire monitoring committee over the
Israeli attacks.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Lebanese nation, including the Hezbollah,
has the legal right to fight against Israeli occupation of Lebanese
lands.
</P>
<P>
Iran refuses to recognize Israel and called it a major factor of
tension and instability in the region. It urges for armed struggle
against Israeli occupation of Arab and Islamic lands.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Iran will use its influence to persuade Hezbollah to
drop its armed struggle provided Israel withdraws troops from south
Lebanon, Kharrazi said that Iran does not believe Israel is sincere
in withdrawing from the occupied land.
</P>
<P>
"If Israel is sincere, it should withdraw from the occupied land
unconditionally," he said.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that Lebanese people and Hezbollah will decide
their stance towards Israel and Iran will not interfere in other
countries' internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister also denied the reports that Tehran
has sent military supplies to Hezbollah guerrillas, saying that the
Iranian support to Hezbollah was limited to humanitarian and
political assistance.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese President Visits Kuwait to Boost Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar el-
Bashir arrived here Monday on a three-day working visit to improve
ties with Kuwait, which were affected by Sudan's sympathy with Iraq
during the 1991 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
Bashir will hold talks later in the day with Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh
Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah on political and economic issues, as well
as other matters of common concern, the official Kuwait News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait downgraded its diplomatic relations with several fellow
Arab nations, including Sudan, which were accused of siding with
Iraq during the 1991 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier remarks by Bashir, the Sudanese-Kuwaiti
talks will touch on the issue of Kuwaiti detainees. Kuwait insists
Iraq still holds over 600 Kuwaiti and third country nationals since
1991, but Baghdad rejected the allegation.
</P>
<P>
Bashir has expressed readiness to play a mediation role on this
sensitive issue, which will certainly be welcomed by Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Sudanese delegation, which includes a large group
of Sudanese businessmen, is expected to express a strong desire to
the Kuwaiti leaders to cement economic cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Bashir, who is on his first visit to
Kuwait since Iraq's invasion of the Gulf emirate in 1990, is
clearly keen on extending moral support to Kuwait in exchange for
economic benefit to ease economic difficulties in Sudan, which has
been beset by a civil war in the south and a wide-spread famine.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Sudan's Foreign Minister Mustafa Othman Ismail said
that President Bashir will also inform the Kuwaiti leaders on the
political development in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Bashir dissolved Sudan's parliament and declared a three-month
state of emergency last December, as a result of power struggle
with Hassan al-Turabi, the powerful parliament speaker and
Secretary General of the ruling National Congress Party.
</P>
<P>
Sudan and Kuwait resumed full ties in July 1999, following a
visit to Kuwait by the Sudanese foreign minister, who hoisted his
country's flag on the Sudanese Embassy in Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Urges for Rules of Law in Global Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 14 (Xinhua) -- United Nation Secretary-
General Kofi Annan Monday urged all world states to uphold the
rules of international law so as to ensure all societies and
cultures blossom and flourish.
</P>
<P>
Delivering the 18th Singapore Lecture organized by the
Institute of Southeast Asian Studies of Singapore, Annan said that
"it is vital to have clear, simple rules that everyone knows and
everyone applies", adding "that is by now virtually a truism in
the world business."
</P>
<P>
He said all states, but small states especially, have an
interest in maintaining an international order "based on something
better than the grim maxim that 'might is right'-- based, in fact,
on the general principles of law which give the same rights to the
weak as to the strong."
</P>
<P>
Annan emphasized that trade, services and investment can only
cross national boundaries when law crosses them as well and the
minimum condition for such transactions is that the trader and
investors have confidence that their property rights will be
respected, that contracts will be fulfilled and that there is some
agreed method of settling disputes when they arise.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the current cross-border transactions on a global
scale to a carefully woven network of international rules and
regulations, listing a number of international conventions and
agreements such as ones concerning free voyage by ships on high
seas and through international straits and crossing-border flying
by airlines.
</P>
<P>
"The more we find ourselves living in a single economic space,
the more we shall depend on such rules," he added.
</P>
<P>
Annan pointed out that technical standards, that help to reduce
transaction costs and to make the risks and profits of business
more predictable, are not sufficient because market forces,
especially when unleashed on a global scale, bring about enormous
and very rapid changes in people's life.
</P>
<P>
"If we treat globalization as a purely economic phenomenon and
apply common rules only in the purely technical and commercial
areas, we are running very high social and political risks," he
warned.
</P>
<P>
"Societies and political systems have to adjust to those
changes," he said, adding "social and political structures are
falling far behind the spread of markets."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the protests seen in Seattle two months ago when
the WTO conference was held there, Annan said the protest groups
were giving voices to some very-widely felt fears and anxieties
about the effects of globalization.
</P>
<P>
He said "they were right to be concerned -about jobs, about
human rights,... about the desperate poverty in which so many
people in developing countries are condemned to live."
</P>
<P>
"They were only wrong in seeking to solve these problems by
forging new shackles for world trade. Such restrictions, if
adopted, would make the problems even worse, by aggravating
poverty and obstructing development," he said.
</P>
<P>
While emphasizing the need for common standards, the UN chief
stressed that "the society cannot and must not be completely
uniform".
</P>
<P>
"People must be able to follow their own traditions without
making war on each other and they must have sufficient freedom to
exchange ideas," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Each nation must not only respect the culture and traditions
of others but must also allow its own citizens the freedom to
think for themselves," he added.
</P>
<P>
The greatest gap between the developing countries and the
industrialized world is the "knowledge gap", Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"It can only be bridged by open-minded research and free,
courageous thought, " he concluded.
</P>
<P>
Annan arrived here Sunday for a three-day official visit after
attending the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
at Bangkok.

<HEADLINE> Manila Cites Gains of Estrada's Bangkok Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines on Monday
hailed the recently concluded visit of President Joseph Estrada to
Bangkok as having underscored the nation's commitment to urge
developed economies to ensure the benefits of globalization to the
world's poor and developing nations.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press briefing here, Presidential Spokesman Jerry
Barican said Estrada's stay in the Thai capital was long enough
for him to drive home his message for the rich countries to extend
more aid to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"His brief stay in Bangkok underscored the Philippine
commitment to active participation in efforts to bring both peace
and prosperity to the world through closer economic and political
ties," Barican said.
</P>
<P>
Barican said the president also set the stage for the possible
entry into the Philippines of foreign investments in the
information technology (IT) sector after meeting with businessmen
in Hong Kong Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The president, Barican said, met with IT and electronic
commerce groups and investors associated with Li Ka Shing, who
with his son is reportedly putting up an IT center in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"I think they discussed the possibility of doing the same in
the Philippines," he said.
</P>
<P>
Barican said Estrada's meetings in Hong Kong show strengthened
investor confidence and heightened interest in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Estrada visited Bangkok last weekend to join world leaders at
the 10th quadrennial session of the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the first major U.N. event in the
new millennium
</P>
<P>
He also met with leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Estrada called for more active cooperation
between ASEAN and the United Nations, and asked wealthy economies
to help the world's poor cross over to better lives by granting
debt relief and more official development assistance to the world'
s most heavily indebted nations.

<HEADLINE> Local Investments Increase Sharply in Past Two Years  in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's local
investments topped the list of investments registered and approved
by the Council for Development of Cambodia (CDC) in 1998 and 1999,
the Vision, a local newspaper, reported.
</P>
<P>
An analysis of capital investment by country in the two years
revealed that Cambodian investments accounted for 572.5 million U.
S.dollars in fixed assets or 42.9 percent of total investments
approved in the past two years, according to the Vision.
</P>
<P>
The Asia Pacific region, comprising China, China's Taiwan, Hong
Kong and Macao, as well as Australia, Japan and Korea, accounted
for some 35.4 percent or 485.9 million U.S. dollars in registered
capital while the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
region ranked third with 223.5 million U.S. dollars in registered
capital or 16.75 percent of total investments approved by the CDC
in 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
Total investments in the two years were established at 1.33
billion, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The past two years' performance was a complete reversal of the
performance between 1994 and 1997 when the ASEAN region was the
top investors in Cambodia with 46.3 percent of the total of 4.494
billion U.S. dollars in investments approved.
</P>
<P>
From August 1994 when the CDC was established till to the end
of 1997, Cambodian investments accounted for 21.7 percent in terms
of registered fixed assets, ranking second behind the ASEAN region,
while the Asia Pacific region ranked third with 15.2 percent of
total investments in fixed assets.

<HEADLINE> Supachai Backs Green Room System in WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 14 (Xinhua) -- President of the 10th Session
of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD
X) Supachai supported the "Green Room" system of the World Trade
Organization, but called for a more transparent and democratic one.
</P>
<P>
When "encountering" non-governmental organizations at a
sideline meeting of the UNCTAD X, Supachai, who will replace the
current Director-General of WTO Michael Moore in two years, said
the Green Room, which allows big countries in decision-making
process, is practical.
</P>
<P>
The system, though represents not every country of the 135-
member bloc, will be quick in coming into a decision.
</P>
<P>
"If you go to the General Council, it may take a year to make a
decision," he said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the Green Room should include the largest
members of the WTO and a rule be made to report all decision made
in the Green Room fully to the General Council.
</P>
<P>
Supachai, Thailand's deputy prime minister and commerce
minister, elaborated that "big" countries included in the Green
Room are not necessarily big by size, but can also be small
countries which have big say in certain area.
</P>
<P>
He said that real democracy should be brought into the Green
Room by allowing more members.
</P>
<P>
As for the controversial consensus procedure used by WTO to
reach an agreement, Supachai said changes should not be allowed
when there are serious objections.
</P>
<P>
Calling himself "close to be a victim" of the consensus
procedure, Supachai said it must be given more transparency.
</P>
<P>
Supachai had undergone a nine-month campaign competing for the
WTO Director-Generalship from November 1998 to July 1999, during
which he was in a leading position at the beginning.
</P>
<P>
However, the consensus procedure blocked him from being elected
by vote and he was brought to accept a shared term with New
Zealander Moore with himself serving the second part starting from
2002.

<HEADLINE> Manila Steps Up Campaign Against Illegal Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
rallied Monday more than 3,000 participants in the First National
Anti-Illegal Drug Forum to wage a war against drug trafficking and
drug abuse in the country.
</P>
<P>
The forum participants included provincial governors, municipal
and city mayors, community chairmen, law enforcers, and leaders of
non-government organizations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the one-day forum held at the
Philippine International Convention Center, Interior and Local
Government Secretary Alfredo Lim urged the local officials, law
enforcers and the private sector to keep working together in the
anti-drug campaign.
</P>
<P>
"With the local officials and the community behind the
government, I do not see any reason why we will fail on our
vigorous campaign to crush 250 billion pesos (6.25 billion U.S.
dollars) a year illegal trade," Lim said.
</P>
<P>
Lim added that records at the National Drugs Law Enforcement
and Prevention Center showed there are now 1.7 million addicts in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Lim also reminded community officials that they are persons in
authority, as legally provided, and are responsible in the
campaign against illegal drug in their respective communities.
</P>
<P>
"Under the law, you can effect arrest of drug pushers and users
in your communities," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the day, Lim said the participants were expected
to come up with an approved action plan to combat the drug abuse
and trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Mandelson Encouraged by IRA Decommissioning Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Northern Ireland
Secretary Peter Mandelson described the Irish Republican Army's
latest statement on decommissioning as "a very encouraging
development" when meeting British and Irish politicians here on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The head of the decommissioning body, General John de
Chastelain, published a report on Friday in which the IRA stated
the context in which it would "put its weapons beyond use."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary body,
Mandelson said that "If it means what it appears to mean, it may
mean that the IRA is ready to give up its arms."
</P>
<P>
However, Mandelson said the statement was not specific and had
come too late to avert the suspension of Northern Ireland's
political institutions.
</P>
<P>
He suspended Northern Ireland's institutions on Friday because
of the impasse over paramilitary disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary body met amid speculation
that the British and Irish government positions on the peace
process have grown apart.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson will also meet Irish Foreign Minister Brian Cowen in
Belfast on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern believes the IRA has made a
huge advance on the arms issue. Writing in Monday's Irish Times,
Ahern set out his views on the latest de Chastelain report on
decommissioning. He said the IRA has, in effect, committed itself
for the first time to decommissioning, after the IRA told the body
the context in which it would put weapons beyond use.
</P>
<P>
Ahern said this is "deeply significant," and stressed the need
to move quickly and build on the IRA's commitment. He said
suspension was damaging the Good Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body, comprising 25
members each from the Westminster and Dublin parliaments, has met
twice a year for the past decade, since it was formed, to improve
political links between Britain and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The 20th conference opened with a reception at the Irish
Embassy in London on Sunday night, with former ministers from the
British and Irish governments among the guests.

<HEADLINE> Heart Disease Still Major Killer in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Heart disease, which kills an
estimated 170,000 people in 15 the European Union (EU) countries
every year, is still one of the most dangerous killers in Europe,
EU heart and public health experts said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
At a one-day meeting titled "Winning Hearts -- Actions and
Policies for A Healthier Europe," the experts warned that stroke
and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are the major killers in Europe.
CVD is no longer a rich man's disease, but one that also afflicts
the poor, they said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that some 170,000 people in the EU die from CVD
annually before the age of 65. About 60,000 die as a result of
unhealthy diets and about 60,000 die because of smoking, they said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, participants called for active policies and
programs to protect children from avoidable heart disease. They
urged the EU governments to create an environment for improving
cardiovascular health in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The experts also put forward some policies and programs to
provide support to candidate EU member countries, where the
prevalence of CVD is especially high, and to reverse the
increasing incidence of CVD in southern European countries caused
by changes to traditional diets and lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
A report released at the meeting by the British Heart
Foundation said that France, Spain and Portugal have the lowest
death rates from coronary heart disease among the EU countries and
have the healthiest diets. Ireland, Finland and Britain are at
the opposite end of the spectrum with the most deaths from heart
disease, killing more than six million people worldwide every year.
</P>
<P>
The 80-page report shows that death rates for adults aged 35 to
74 in Ireland and Finland are more than four times the rate in
France.
</P>
<P>
It also shows that Ireland and England also have the highest
rates of coronary bypass operations in the EU and the lowest
consumption of fruit and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
The conference is organized by the European Heart Network in
association with the European Society of Cardiology.

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Warns Kosovo Rioters Against Attacking KFOR Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General George
Robertson on Monday warned rioters in Kosovo that the alliance-led
international peacekeeping force KFOR would not tolerate any act
of attack against its troops.
</P>
<P>
Robertson said that KFOR will not tolerate attacks on its
forces by anyone and that the robust response of KFOR soldiers is
only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to NATO's determination
to protect its forces and stop the perpetrators of violence in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Two French peacekeepers were wounded in gunfire that killed two
people and wounded 11 others in the northern Kosova town of
Kosovska Mitrovica, where KFOR troops arrested 39 ethnic Albanians
and one Serb for the violence over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Describing the violence against the international peacekeepers
as "a shameful and cowardly act," the NATO chief said that he
would remind all parties in Kosovo that it was NATO that had been
working toward restoring peace and stability for all ethnic groups
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The arrested were suspected of sniping and handling illegal
weapons, according to NATO sources.
</P>
<P>
The French peacekeepers earlier detained one ethnic Albanian
sniper who shot at the international peacekeepers in that town.
</P>
<P>
Kosovska Mitrovica has been a trouble spot for the
international peacekeepers since they moved in last June to
separate ethnic Albanians and Serbs who live in the town.

<HEADLINE> EU Concerned About Cyanide Spill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
expressed its concern on Monday about the cyanide spill that has
polluted the tributaries of the Danube River in central Europe.
</P>
<P>
The pill originated in northwestern Romania where the dam at
the Baia Mare gold mining firm overflowed on January 30 and caused
cyanide to pour into several streams. The polluted water of these
streams then flowed into the river Tisa in neighboring Hungary and
then on into Yugoslavia before entering the Danube.
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson for the European Commission, the executive body
of the 15-nation bloc, said the EU is trying to determine how it
can help.
</P>
<P>
The cyanide spill into the river Tisa has poisoned thousands of
fish.
</P>
<P>
The EU can, she said, either evaluate or help deal with the
environmental damage caused by the cyanide spill which occurred in
Romania two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
A cyanide solution is used to separate gold ore from
surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P>
The commission is sending officials to the region to conduct a
field survey before deciding. She added that though there is no
emergency fund to deal with such incidents, it is possible that
the cohesion fund, which is allocated for countries applying for
EU membership, can be used to cope with the environmental incident.
</P>
<P>
A Hungarian environmental official, Zoltan Illes, has described
the incident as the worst environmental catastrophe since
Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which lies further
downstream on the Danube and receives water from the Tisa, has
asked for compensation for the pollution.

<HEADLINE> France Vows to Bring Troublemakers in Kosovo into Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister Alain
Richard said on Monday that the international peacekeeping force
in Kosovo (KFOR) will "bring into line" all those who want to
plunge the Yugoslav province of Kosovo into violence.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with radio Europe 1, Richard said that KFOR
will get the situation in the northern city of Kosovska Mitrovica
under control as it did in the previous conflict between ethnic
Serbs and Albanians in August 1999.
</P>
<P>
One Albanian sniper was killed and five injured by French KFOR
troops in Kosovska Mitrovica during a shoot-out on Sunday. Two
French soldiers were also injured.
</P>
<P>
"KFOR will again get the upper hand. Those who want to
relaunch a conflict and violence between the two communities will
be put into line with all the means at the disposal of the
international community," said Richard.
</P>
<P>
Kosovska Mitrovica is divided by the river Ibar into two
separate parts. Tension has remained tight between the Serb
community living north of the river and the Albanian community in
the south.
</P>
<P>
France is in charge of the security in the city with an 8,000-
man brigade, consisting of soldiers from France, Belgium, the
United Arab Emirates, Denmark, Russia and Morocco.
</P>
<P>
After last week's clashes in the city, British troops of KFOR
have also been sent there.

of Shenzhen for its fast-developing hi-tech industries during a
recent inspection tour of the city in southern Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Li urged local officials to work harder to turn Shenzhen into
a beautiful modern city under important instructions from
President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Iran Repeats Call for U.S. Sincerity in Improving Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi reiterated Monday that the United States should take
concrete steps to prove its sincerity in improving ties with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran is willing to develop relations with all countries on the
basis of mutual respect and equality, Kharrazi told reporters here
prior to the sensitive parliamentary elections on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"If the U.S. change its current hostile policies toward Iran and
take steps in practice to show its sincerity, it will be no
exception" for Iran to enhance ties with it, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi stressed that Iran will not sacrifice its national
interests and principles for closer Iran-U.S. ties.
</P>
<P>
Confirming changes in remarks of U.S. officials, the Iranian
foreign minister said that Iran has no confidence on the U.S.
sincerity in promoting ties with Iran now.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. needs to take concrete steps to prove its sincerity
and we are waiting for that," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the U.S. severed diplomatic relations in 1980 following
the takeover of the U.S. embassy in Tehran by radical Iranian
students at the heydays of the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
After Iran's moderate President Mohammad Khatami came to power
with the detente policy in 1997, senior U.S. officials have
repeatedly called for "unconditional talks" with Iran.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright recently stated that
Washington expected the result of the coming Iranian parliamentary
polling would help the U.S. and Iran normalize their relations.
</P>
<P>
The 6th Iranian parliamentary polling to be held on Friday is
seen crucial for the Iranian moderates, supporters of Khatami, and
the conservatives, who still dominate the country's most sensitive
organs.
</P>
<P>
The moderates expected a majority in the Iranian legislative
body to help Khatami to accelerate his moderate reforms while the
conservatives are determined to strengthen their dominance to
safeguard the values of the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials always stress that talks with the U.S. will be
useless if Washington refuses to change its hostile policy towards
Tehran and continues its sanctions against Iran.

<HEADLINE> Denktash: Third Round Of Cyprus Talks To Be Tough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash has said that the third round of the Cyprus proximity
talks in May would be somewhat different from and "tougher and more
intense" than the previous two rounds.
</P>
<P>
Denktash made the remarks in a telephone interview from Germany,
where he was on a visit to Berlin following the second round of
proximity talks in Geneva which started on January 31, the Turkish
Daily News reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, an eastern Mediterranean island country, has been
divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled north and the Greek
Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of an
abortive pro-Athens military coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has tried for decades to reunite the island
but talks between the two communities have so far yielded no
tangible results.
</P>
<P>
Under a renewed call from U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan,
Greek Cypriot leader Glafcos Clerides and Denktash held two rounds
of proximity talks, first in New York last December and then in the
Swiss city of Geneva this year. No breakthrough whatsoever was
reported yet.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has since 1998 maintained that the only way out of the
Cyprus issue is to establish a confederation on the basis of two
states and that the talks should be conducted accordingly. But the
suggestion was rejected by the Greek Cypriot side and international
community at large.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Geneva talks, Denktash said that the grounds
for a face-to-face meeting with Clerides, had not yet been
established.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the third round will be a different exercise. In the
third round, I hope we shall be able to test to what extend the
ground is prepared. Therefore, the third round would be somewhat
different, a little bit tougher, more intense," he added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Alverto de Soto, the U.N. special envoy for
Cyprus, sounded a pessimistic tone at the end of the Geneval round
of talks, saying that it would be naive to expect a settlement of
the Cyprus issue by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM: No Change in Policy Over Rushdie Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said Monday that his government has not changed its policy
over the issue of British writer Salman Rushdie, who was sentenced
to death by late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
"There is no change in Iran's stance over the Rushdie issue and
Tehran's policy is very clear," Kharrazi told a press conference on
the eve of the sensitive parliamentary elections on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said that he and British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook reached
a consensus during their talks in New York in September 1998 that
the Rushdie issue should not remain as a hurdle for the improvement
of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
"What we reached in the talks is still valid," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to put aside the Rushdie issue in order to
normalize Tehran-London ties after the Iranian foreign minister
assured that the Iranian government would not take or support any
action against Rushdie's life.
</P>
<P>
However, he underlined that the religious decree, or fatwa,
issued by Khomeini against Rushdie's life "is irrevocable."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hard-liners on Monday once again pledged to carry out
the decade-long death sentence on Rushdie on the 11th anniversary
of Khomeini's fatwa.
</P>
<P>
Tehran radio reported that the state-run Islamic Propagation
Organization (IPO), the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC)
and some foundations issued statements in support of the death
sentence.
</P>
<P>
"The sacred fatwa or religious decree issued by Imam Khomeini
against Rushdie's life is irrevocable and must be carried out," the
statements said.
</P>
<P>
On February 14, 1989, Khomeini issued the fatwa against
Rushdie's life on the charge that his novel "the Satanic Verses"
has insulted Islamic prophet Mohammad, and the Iranian private
Khordad 15 Foundation offered an award of 2.8 million U.S. dollars
to those who will carry out the death sentence.
</P>
<P>
Hard-line Iranian authorities and private organizations have
slammed the government for promising not to send commandos to kill
Rushdie, and vowed to take Rushdie's life.

<HEADLINE> LDCs More Marginalized in Globalization: Ugandan  Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The least developed countries
(LDCs) are becoming further marginalized from the mainstream of
the world economy, head of Ugandan delegation to the 10th session
of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)
said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The net result (of globalization) is that a number of
developing countries, particularly the LDCs, run the risk of
further marginalization," said General Moses Ali, Ugandan second
deputy prime minister and minister of tourism, trade and industry
in a statement at the general debate of the conference.
</P>
<P>
"The differences in per capita incomes between the countries
with the poorest 20 percent of the world's population (a group
that consists mainly of LDCs) and the richest 20 percent have
widened as globalization has advanced," said Ali.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that LDCs growth rates lag behind those of other
countries and their share of world exports and imports has
continued to fall very sharply.
</P>
<P>
These countries have attracted a negligible share of global
financial flows of foreign direct investment and remain heavily
dependent upon official development assistance to finance a large
share of their investments.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the majority of their population remains trapped
in abject poverty and social exclusion.
</P>
<P>
Ali asked the international community to help the LDCs to
conquer these challenges by reversing the decline in the economic
and social conditions in these countries and by reactivating and
promoting economic growth, recovery and development.
</P>
<P>
Ali also urged the international society to help enhance the
process of structural transformation in these economies and
reverse their continued marginalization in world trade and ensure
their full and successful integration into international trade and
the global economy on an equal footing.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military Respects President's Decision to  Deactivate Wiranto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian military (TNI)
respects the decision of president Abdurrahman Wahid to deactivate
Gen. Wiranto from his position as coordinating minister for
politics and security affairs, a military spokesman said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The TNI respects each good decision for the safety of the
nation," Marshall Graito Usodo was quoted by Antara News Agency as
saying, adding the decision to deactivate Wiranto was the
prerogative right of the president.
</P>
<P>
There is no problem if Wiranto is given other position, Usodo
said. "But if (Wiranto) is returned to the TNI, we will respect
Pak Wiranto and (he) will get his right as a soldier like the
others," Usodo added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, TNI chief Adm. Widodo said he felt sure that Wiranto
would accept the decision sincerely.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Secretary of the TNI Advocacy Team on East
Timor Human Right Abuse Yan Juanda Saputra told Antara that the
team will also respect the decision of President Wahid.
</P>
<P>
"We see (the move) as a presidential prerogative. But we have
to take a good look whether it was the best solution available,"
Saputra said, adding Wiranto should not have been relieved of his
post if there were other solutions.
</P>
<P>
"If it (the move) is aimed to facilitate the investigation by
the Attorney General Office, I think it would not have been much
of a bother if he (Wiranto) stayed in his post (as coordinating
minister for politics and security)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging the shock, Saputra pointed out that the problem
probably lies with the Attorney General Office, saying may be
President Wahid got input from people who lack knowledge of the
case.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Attorney General Marzuki Darusman said that his side
have not yet found constraints in investigating those who were
allegedly involved in human right abuse in East Timor as were
recommended by the National Commission on Human Right (Komn as HAM)
early this month.
</P>
<P>
The Commission has recommended to the Attorney General Office
to launch a comprehensive investigation against at least 33 people
consisting of civilians and military officials including Wiranto
who were allegedly involved in what the commission called a crime
against humanity in East Timor under which thousands of East
Timorese died and tens of thousands others took refuge in 1999
after the territory voted in favor of independence.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, it is not a problem (for the Attorney General Office)
whether Wiranto is being deactivated or not (as Coordinating
Minister for Politics and Security)," Darusman was quoted by
Antara News Agency as saying, adding there is also no constraint
if Wiranto stayed in his cabinet post.

<HEADLINE> Wiranto Says, He Is not a Dissident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- General Wiranto, who is just
deactivated from his cabinet post by Indonesian president
Abdurrahman Wahid, insisted on Monday that he was not a dissident
although he stayed in his post instead of resigning when president
Wahid was in his tour and requested him voluntarily to leave the
post of coordinating minister for politics and security affairs.
</P>
<P>
"But nothing other than I want to help the president to get a
comprehensive information to make a decision, so that I, as a
servant of the president, have a right to make suggestion to the
president in order that the president will not make a wrong
decision," Wiranto was quoted by Antara News Agency as saying in a
press conference at Bina Graha Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
President Wahid, during his European and Asian tour, requested
Gen. Wiranto who was then the Indonesian Military (TNI) chief to
resign from his cabinet post after a disclosure made by the
National Commission on Human Right that he was responsible for
human right abuse in East Timor in 1999.
</P>
<P>
But Wiranto refused to resign, saying he would do so if only
the court finds him guilty.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto also said that the decision of the president to
deactivate him was the prerogative right of the president.
</P>
<P>
While expressing thanks to President Wahid who made the
decision after returning home from abroad, Wiranto said that the
president had met him before the decision came out.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, observers said that Wiranto should be reinstated to
his post of coordinating minister for politics and security
affairs, if the court finds him innocent of human right abuse in
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"Politically, Wiranto deserves to be reinstated," a political
observer from the University of Diponegoro was quoted by Antara
News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Another observer, Ari Pradhanawati, also agreed that Wiranto
has the right to be rehabilitated if the court finds him innocent.
</P>
<P>
"In this case, Wiranto should also be reinstated to his cabinet
post," Pradhanawati said, adding that the decision of President
Wahid to deactivate Wiranto was the right move to facilitate
investigation.

JAKARTA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Amid speculation of further

which has been made, military spokesman Marshall Graito Usodo said
on Monday.

quoted by Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also feels sure that Wiranto will accept the decision of
President Wahid sincerely.

<P>
Based on presidential decree No. 29, 2000, which is validated
on February 14, 2000, President Wahid has deactivated General
Wiranto from his cabinet post of coordinating minister for
politics and security affairs and designated Home Affairs Minister
Surjadi Sudirja to replace his post.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Wahid insisted that he has no problem at
all with the military following his decision to deactivate Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
"News which said that I am hostile to the military are wrong.
There is no showdown between the president and the military.
Yesterday I met with Vice President Megawati Soekarnoputeri and
Wiranto. There was no problem," Wahid was quoted by Antara as
saying.

BANGKOK, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Conference
on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) launched investment and
enterprise development programs with five countries in Latin
America, a press release of the 10th session of UNCTAD said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The five countries are Bolivia, Brazil, El Salvador, Guatemala
and Panama.
</P>
<P>
Latin America has become the largest recipient of foreign
direct investment (FDI) in the developing world since 1999. Brazil
leads the region as of last year with 31 billion U.S. dollars in
FDI, about 40 percent of the regional total.
</P>
<P>
The project in Brazil is aimed at improving the effectiveness
of its investment promotion program by helping the country to
attract "better" FDI, which refers to the investment in key
industries and the investment that is export-oriented.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD's assistance is designed in part to enhance the positive
impact of FDI through linkages to export-oriented small and medium-
sized enterprises (SMEs).
</P>
<P>
At the request of the Bolivian government, UNCTAD launched a
program to develop and implement a national investment and
promotion strategy in the country, which accounted for less than
one percent of the region's FDI inflow last year.
</P>
<P>
In Central America, UNCTAD launched a program on enterprise
development to help entrepreneurs build innovative and
internationally competitive SMEs.
</P>
<P>
The programs in El Salvador, Guatemala and Panama will create a
well-educated class of local entrepreneurs trained to work with
foreign investors, create job opportunities and diffuse new
technologies and skills.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for Restructuring of WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Restructuring is necessary for
the World Trade Organization (WTO) to achieve fair and non-
discriminatory participation of all, Iranian Commerce Minister
Mohamad Shariatmadari said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark during the general debate on the third of
the 10th Session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD X), which was held here from February 12 to 19.
</P>
<P>
"The present structure of WTO could be manipulated to obstruct
the accession of some developing countries to it, as has been the
case of Iran," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Using concepts such as sustainable development, transparency,
good governance, social and environmental standards and the like
as leverage should be avoided," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged that work must be done to prevent the extraterritorial
application of domestic legislation of developed countries and
enforce laws and regulations to restrict transnational
corporations and mergers from adversely affecting the
competitiveness of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"The continuous transfer of technology and know-how must be
facilitated from industrialized countries to the developing world
on a non-discriminatory basis," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also called on UNCTAD to expand its technical assistance and
continue its activities in the analysis of important international
trade issues.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Reinforce Inspection on Marine Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Angolan fishery authorities
will reinforce the inspections over the quality of the marine
products for exportation, the Angolan Institute of Fishery
Inspection said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Victoria Neto, General Director of the institute, said that a
one- million-U.S. dollar specialized laboratory capable of
checking the quality of the marine products for exportation will
soon be set up.
</P>
<P>
Neto warned the ship owners that Angola could suspend its
exportation of sea food to the European markets if the fishers and
ship owners cannot meet the requirements of the inspectors by the
end of December.
</P>
<P>
Fishers and ship owners are also urged to improve the sanitary
conditions for the processing and conservation of the marine
products, which will help them satisfy the requirements of the
fishery inspection institute.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that every year, Angola, one major fish
producer in Africa, has a total of 850,000 tons of fish resources
which have commercial catch value.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Angola has fishing cooperation agreements with the
European Union (EU) and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Countries such as the Republic of Korea and Kuwait also have
fishing ships operating in the southern African country.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Refugees in camps in
Tanzania's western Kigoma Region and Kenya are now interfering
with local wildlife and natural reserves, Tanzanian media reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are
feeding on rare species of gazelles, chimpanzees and baboons from
nearby national parks and chopping down trees to make fire for
cooking, camp commanders from Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania were
quoted as saying by the African newspaper.
</P>
<P>
According to the commanders attending a course on the impact of
refugees on the environment which ended here last weekend,
refugees were eating rare species of chimpanzees living in the
protected areas.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has taken measures to move the rare
species of the gazelles to safer areas, participants from the
country said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, much is being done to conserve the environment of
the refugee camps, including the introduction of solar energy
cookers to reduce tree falling.
</P>
<P>
Although efforts for afforestation have been initiated, areas
surrounding most refugee camps in the east African region have
been left bare.
</P>
<P>
Pasture land has been exhausted and waster sources left in a
mess, said the commanders.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that more than 95,000 Congolese
refugees have arrived in Tanzania's western Kigoma Region since
august 1999.  Government officials have warned that if the
present influx continues, they will be forced to allocate more
land to accommodate the refugees.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Urges UNCTAD to Help Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 14 (Xinhua) -- South African Trade and
Industry Minister Alec Erwin has urged the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) to offer more
technical assistance to poor countries and to encourage
partnerships between developing and developed nations.
</P>
<P>
Erwin made the call at the opening of the 10th session of the
UNCTAD in Bangkok, Thailand, South African Press Association
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries want to strengthen their capacity and they
need technical assistance to do this, the South African minister
noted.
</P>
<P>
He said his call for more technical assistance is a logical
proposition as developed countries are also aware of the imbalance
between the First World and the Third World.
</P>
<P>
Erwin reminded delegates that participants agreed at UNCTAD's
previous conference in 1996 that economies were interdependent.
</P>
<P>
"The centrality of our interdependence and the need to grapple
decisively with development were factors that committed all to
continue the work of UNCTAD and to strengthen it," Erwin told the
four-yearly world trade conference.
</P>
<P>
He said this week's conference would help improve the
participants' understanding of the challenges of development and
boost their efforts to provide a better life for the world's
citizens.

<HEADLINE> East China Province to Expand Cooperation with Multinationals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, February 14 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province,
one of the country's economic powerhouses, has decided to expand
cooperation with multinational corporations in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
"Drawing investment from multinationals will be a key part of
our efforts to promote overseas investment in the province," said
Shandong's Vice-Governor Du Shicheng.
</P>
<P>
Du said at a recent meeting on foreign trade that Shandong
encourages multinationals to engage in high-tech industries, the
service trades, and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Areas like finance, foreign trade, tourism, telecommunications,
and transportation will open wider to multinationals, Du said.
</P>
<P>
Major cities such as Jinan, the provincial capital, and Qingdao,
a coastal port, will play a key role in using investment from
multinationals.
</P>
<P>
According to Du, Shandong will take a series of measures to
create a favorable business environment for multinational
investors.
</P>
<P>
The province will ban all administrative fees that are not
approved by the State Council, the Ministry of Finance, the State
Development Planning Commission, and the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
A responsibility system will be established at related
government departments to handle complaints from overseas
investors.
</P>
<P>
Greater efforts will also be made to improve various overseas
investment services in the province.
</P>
<P>
Shandong has established a total of more than 20,000 overseas-
funded enterprises during the past two decades, 10,245 of which
are now operational.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Playing Big Role in Reunification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) has
been playing an important role in the country's reunification
efforts.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, the National Committee of the CPPCC has
worked hard to bring together many compatriots from the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR) and Taiwan Province.
</P>
<P>
During the celebrations for Macao's return to the motherland on
December 20 last year, the CPPCC National Committee sponsored a
series of events marking the momentous occasion. These included
issuing printing materials among CPPCC members, holding forums and
lectures, receiving delegations from Macao and sending members to
participate in local celebrations in the territory.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Taiwan was also placed on the top of the CPPCC
National Committee's agenda. Special workshops were held last year
in memory of the fourth anniversary of President Jiang Zemin's key
speech on the Taiwan issue and the reunification.
</P>
<P>
CPPCC National Committee members have also played an active
role in promoting Taiwanese investment on the mainland. They have
supported and helped Taiwanese investors tackling a variety of
problems. The National Committee of the CPPCC sponsored meetings
to exchange views on dealing with Taiwanese investment.
</P>
<P>
In last year's counterattack against Lee Teng-hui's "two-state
remarks", CPPCC members made declarations, wrote articles, held
forums and made contacts with compatriots of Taiwan origin living
overseas.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC National Committee received 47 delegations and 630
visitors from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan and sent three
delegations overseas in 1999.

<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji has
called that more attention is needed in understanding the people
and resolving problems among the masses.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who is a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee,
made the remarks while visiting the Bureau for Handling Letters
and Visits of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The bureau acts as a bridge linking the government, the Party
and the Chinese people. The premier said that employees of it
should work harder and make contributions to reform and social
stability.
</P>
<P>
The bureau receives a steady flow of letters and visits from
Chinese from all walks of life. They express a number of concerns
and complaints, and raise numerous constructive suggestions.
</P>
<P>
The letters and visits show that the Chinese people trust the
Party and the government as well as their concern for state
affairs, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the bureau is an excellent barometer in gauging
the thoughts of the Chinese people and a "window" for receiving
comments and suggestions from the people. These letters and visits
can be used to monitor officials and expose those who engage in
corrupt practices.
</P>
<P>
The premier hopes that the Chinese people should be encouraged
to send their proposals and suggestions about the Party and the
government to the bureau at any time.

KUALA LUMPUR, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has decided to
apply provisional measures in the form of provisional anti-dumping
duties on three Thai gypsum board exporters, the country's
International Trade and Industry Ministry announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The duties of 203.4 percent, 60.6 percent and 60.6 percent will
be applied to Thai Gypsum Products Public Co. Ltd., Siam Gypsum
Industry Co. Ltd and SCT Co. Ltd, respectively, and the
provisional measures will be effective for not more than 120 days
from February 15, 2000, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The decision for the imposition was made based on findings of
preliminary investigations conducted by the government, it said,
adding the investigations were conducted following a petition
filed by a local company, Boral Plasterboard (M) Sdn Bhd, which
alleged that the import of gypsum boards from Thailand were dumped
and thereby causing material injury to the local industry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that the investigations found the imports of
gypsum boards from Thailand into Malaysia by the three Thai
companies were made at "dumped prices."

ISLAMABAD, February 14 (Xinhua) -- A chartered plane carrying
former hostages aboard a hijacked Afghan jet from London arrived
in Afghanistan's southern city of Kandahar Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The 73 hostages carried back by the Antonov-24 plane were

Taliban regime, including Foreign Minister Wakil Admed Mutawakil,
Afghan sources told Xinhua from Kandahar.

honor, and the women with chadar, special clothes representing
dignity.
</P>

At a news conference following Mbeki's meeting with his
Zimbabwean counterpart Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwean officials said
that the two sides had also discussed measures to resolve the fuel
and electricity crisis in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
A delegation from ZESA (Zimbabwe's electricity supply
authority) is due in Pretoria this week for talks with Eskom
(South Africa's electricity supply authority) on how to deal with
the crisis and ZESA's 20-million-U.S. dollar debt to the South
African power utility.
</P>
<P>
It is understood that the South African government's first
choice is to gain a minority equity stake in the state-controlled
ZESA in exchange for the debt. Other options include conversion
of the debt into a loan of ceding some power plants to Eskom.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Commerce and Industry Minister Nathan Shamuyarira
said his country had made proposals which were "considered very
favorably" by the South African delegation.

<HEADLINE> Exports Continue to Play Major Role in South Korean Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Exports are continuing to play a
major role in boosting both the economic growth and the per captia
income, the South Korea International Trade Association said in a
report Monday.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's exports rose nine percent to 144.2 billion U.S.
dollars in 1999 over the previous year, helping push up the
country's economic growth by 5.2 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
This means that exports accounted for 52.2 percent of the
nation's economic growth as a whole, showing a continued key
factor in the South Korean economy, said the association.
</P>
<P>
As seen in previous years, the impact of exports on the South
Korean economy is obvious and they have been the main tools of the
nation's economic recovery and improved international credibility,
the association said in the report.

<HEADLINE> Green Refrigerator Project Launched to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- China has launched a project
to produce more energy-efficient refrigerators in a bid to control
greenhouse gas emission through saving coal-produced electric
power.
</P>
<P>
With 9.617 million U.S. dollar funding from the Global
Environment Facility, the project, known as China Energy-efficient
Refrigerator Project, aims to encourage refrigerator manufacturers
in China to introduce new energy-efficient technology and
consumers to buy the product.
</P>
<P>
Peng Zhengyou, an official with the State Environmental
Protection Administration, said the new technology available is
one quarter or 35 percent more energy-efficient than those being
used by Chinese refrigerator producers.
</P>
<P>
If the new technology is widely adopted, China, whose annual
refrigerator output is 10 million units, could save 120 million
kwh of power in the course of 15 years.
</P>
<P>
That means hundreds of millions of tons of coal will be saved,
which otherwise would have emitted 100 million tons of greenhouse
gas carbon dioxide as well as other air pollutants from coal-
powered power plants.
</P>
<P>
But a refrigerator with the new technology would cost an extra
65 to 75 U.S. dollars than current models, which explains why it
is quite rare in the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Peng said the five-year project will provide financial and
technical support for selected producers.
</P>
<P>
There are about 100 million refrigerators in use in Chinese
families, using about 12 percent of the total power consumption in
China.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Despite his own deadline for reaching a framework agreement
with the Palestinians passed Sunday with no agreement in sight,
Prime Minister Ehud Barak noted that a framework deal is still a
priority.
</P>
<P>
For a framework agreement to work, however, there must be "deep
flexibility" from both sides, Barak reportedly told a weekly
cabinet meeting. It is vital to maintain confidence levels between
Israel and the Palestinians, but there must be transparency and no
manipulation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Hezbollah is acting as the liaison between Iran and
Palestinian Islamic organizations against the peace process with
Israel. Representatives of Hamas, the Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah
have met in Beirut and other locations to coordinate their anti-
Israel activities.
</P>
<P>
Iran's motive behind the coordinated activities of the three
organizations is to strike a blow against the peace process,
without taking a center-stage role as the saboteur of the process.
</P>
<P>
Maariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States ambassador, Martin Indyk, is said to be
pushing for a U.S.-Israel defense treaty as part of any peace deal
between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
The bottom line of the treaty would be that any attack on Israel
would be viewed in Washington as an attack against the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Police questioned President Ezer Weizman on Sunday for the
second time regarding the funds he received from French millionaire
Edouard Seroussi.
</P>
<P>
Inspector-General Yehuda Wilk said after the questioning that he
hoped it would be the last time the president is questioned. He
said that the police are doing their utmost to swiftly conclude the
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Israel, U.S. Working on Defense Pact: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the United States
are working on an official joint defense pact as part of a peace
package between Israel and both Syria and the Palestinians, local
media reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, the bottom line of the pact is that
any attacks on Israel would be viewed by Washington as attacks on
the U.S.. Such a deal would grant the U.S. more direct
responsibility for defending Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
Within the framework of the pact, Israel would allow the U.S. to
station logistical bases on its soil to facilitate American
military operations that could be required in case Israel confronts
a military threat, the local daily Ha'aretz said.
</P>
<P>
Washington is pushing for the pact, believing that it would
widen the support by the Israeli public for any final peace
agreements Prime Minister Ehud Barak reaches with Syria or the
Palestinians, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The idea of such a pact was reportedly mooted during one of the
several meetings in the last few months between Barak and U.S.
President Bill Clinton in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The contacts for forging the pact accelerated with the renewal
of negotiations between Israel and Syria last December, and it is
supposed to be finalized when a peace treaty between the two
countries is reached, according to Ha'aretz paper.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and American teams are due to meet in Washington next
week to go over the agreement's elements, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli defense establishment has reportedly expressed
reservations over the pact, since it might lead to the reduction in
the amount of U.S. military aid to Israel and limit Israel's arms
sales to other countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy in Israel said Sunday that the idea of signing
such a defense treaty is considered by Ambassador Martin Indyk but
it is not currently a U.S. political initiative.
</P>
<P>
Barak's office also said that it is too early to discuss the
issue.

<HEADLINE> China's Entry Into WTO Good For All: WTO Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Director-General of the
World Trade Organization Mike Moore said here Monday that it is
good for all to have China in WTO.
</P>
<P>
Moore, who is making a one-day stopover in Singapore en route
to Indonesia, told a press conference that it will be a splendid
day when China comes into WTO and "it will be good for the world,
for China,for all WTO members to have China in."
</P>
<P>
He said joining the WTO is the biggest decision for China since
1949 and he expects China will enter the world trade body within
this year.
</P>
<P>
China's entry into WTO will make a perfect society of the world
and will represent a very good start, he added.
</P>
<P>
On his forthcoming visit to China later this week, Moore said
he has been invited to China to discuss China's entry into WTO to
find out if there are problems that prevent them from joining.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to China to change China's politics," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the anxiety about globalization shown at the WTO
meeting in Seattle last year and the current UNCTAD meeting in
Bangkok, Moore said it is true that not everyone benefits from
globalization, which he sees as an economic process, rather than a
political policy.

<HEADLINE> Inter-American Bank Chief Calls for "New Development Paradigm" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 14 (Xinhua) -- President of the Inter-
American Bank Enrique Iglesias called here Monday for a "new
development paradigm" to deal with economic vulnerability and
social instability.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the interactive debate of the 10th session of the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD X),
Iglesias said while economic and political advances had been made
in Latin America, strong, stable and equitable growth remained
elusive.
</P>
<P>
In any new paradigm the challenges of economic vulnerability
and social instability have to be addressed, Iglesias said, adding
that to achieve stable growth, integration has to be extremely
successful with more savings and a better distribution of exports.
</P>
<P>
To avoid social instability in Latin America, Iglesias called
for reforming the distribution system of income, and for good
governance and more attention to information technologies, which
he thinks will help improve competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized the need to raise the level of education,
which he believes is the only way to break the vicious circle of
poverty in Latin America.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, February 14 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong has
launched a massive campaign since the beginning of this year to
restructure its foreign trade to meet challenges and opportunities
possibly resulting from the country's anticipated entry into the
World Trade Organization.
</P>

Shandong's Vice-Governor Du Shicheng said that the move aims to
sharpen the competitive edge of the province on the international
market.
</P>
<P>
Du said that measures are being taken to increase the
proportion of high quality and high-tech products in the exports
of the province.
</P>
<P>
Priority is given to expanding exports of home electrical
appliances and various new products.
</P>
<P>
In the years to come, Du said, the province will pursue a more
diversified-market strategy while resuming trade with neighboring
countries recovering from the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
More business modes, including chain business, export-oriented
processing, and service trade, will be adopted in accordance with
international practices in the province.
</P>
<P>
Exports and imports of Shandong reached 18.27 billion U.S.
dollars last year, up 10 percent from 1998.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Becomes Guangdong's Second Major Investment Source </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan has become the second
major source of investment to Guangdong Province, China's
forerunner of reform and opening-up drive.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong's first investment source is Hong Kong, said local
sources.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, 1,342 investment contracts between
Guangdong and Taiwan were signed in 1999 alone, up 7.6 percent
from 1998. The contracts involved 637 million U.S. dollars of
investment from Taiwan, up 24 percent from 1998. And Taiwan
investors placed in 626 million U.S. dollars of investment in the
past year, up by 29.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
By late 1999, Taiwan investors had altogether financed 11,000
businesses in Guangdong and pumped up eight billion U.S. dollars

<HEADLINE> Macao SAR Govt to Move in Former Governor's Palace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The headquarters of the Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR) government will be moved to
the former palace of Portuguese governor in Macao, the Macao Daily
News reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, an adjacent office building for the seven sub-
secretaries of the former Portuguese Macao government will serve
as offices of principal officials of the Macao SAR government, the
paper quoted Macao SAR officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Relevant re-designing is well under way and the refitting is
expected to be completed in mid-September. That means the chief
executive and leading officials of the SAR may move in before
October 1, China's National Day.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive and senior officials of the SAR now work in
a leased office building.
</P>
<P>
Featuring architectural style in south Europe, the former
governor's palace used to be personal property which was completed
in 1841. Its proprietor later lost a lawsuit and in 1881 the
building was changed to the hands of the Portuguese governor at
that time.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian, Algerian Leaders Discuss Bilateral, Pan- Arab Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein and visiting Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika Sunday
evening discussed bilateral and pan-Arab cooperation and the latest
developments in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian leader arrived here from Saudi Arabia earlier in
the day for a three-day visit, the second leg of his regional tour
which will also take him to the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Bouteflika will meet with Jordanian Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff Mohammad Malkawi and inspect military
exercises being held in northern and eastern part of the kingdom,
Jordanian officials said.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the two countries will also sign agreements in
various fields, including the health sector.
</P>
<P>
"Jordan and Algeria enjoy very strong relations in different
fields which will be highlighted during the visit," Jordanian
Information Minister Saleh Kallab said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika`s visit to Amman is the first since he was elected
president in April 1999.
</P>

King Abdullah paid his first working visit to Algeria at the end
of May 1999, and expressed Jordan`s support for Algeria and
Bouteflika in their struggle to ensure security and stability in

<HEADLINE> Documents on Kuwaiti Puppet Premier Lost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Documents concerning the
trial of Al Aa Hussein, head of Kuwait's puppet government set up
by Iraq after its invasion in 1990, have been stolen from the
office of public prosecutor here.
</P>
<P>
The safe in which the documents were kept was destroyed by
thieves who broke into the office, Kuwait's two English dailies
reported on Monday, without giving the source of the news.
</P>
<P>
The incident, described as an act of sabotage, occurred during
the weekend holidays, the papers said. The Justice and Interior
ministries have already swung into action to investigate the case,
they added.
</P>
<P>
However, there have been no official words about the incident so
far.
</P>
<P>
Local Arabic-language newspaper Al-Watan on Monday quoted a
prosecution source as denying that only the door of a staff's
office in the prosecution department was opened by strangers.
</P>
<P>
As Kuwait's criminal court has decided to start examining Al
Aa's case on February 20, the loss of the documents may further
complicate the trial.
</P>
<P>
Al Aa and his four children returned to Kuwait from Norway in
early January. The Kuwaiti government has claimed that he
returned "totally upon his own will and without previous official
preparations."
</P>
<P>
Al Aa, once a young lieutenant in the Kuwaiti army, along with
eight other men who worked in the Ministry of Defense, was said to
be taken to Iraq just a few days after the invasion on August 2,
1990.
</P>
<P>
It was announced later that they had formed the provisional
(Kuwaiti) government, headed by Al Aa.
</P>
<P>
After the Iraqi troops were driven out of Kuwait by the U.S.-led
multi-national forces in 1991, the eight men were released at the
Kuwaiti border and each was given 50,000 U.S. dollars by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
As they said on their return they were forced to cooperate with
the Iraqi regime, Kuwaiti legal authorities, which found their
claims genuine, acquitted them of any wrong-doing.
</P>
<P>
But Al Aa stayed in Iraq and left for Norway about two years
ago. He was sentenced to death in absentia by a Kuwaiti court in
1991 on charges of high treason.
</P>
<P>
The main aim he chose to return to Kuwait was, in his own words,
to appeal against the death sentence on him.

</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>

He said that the new pact would bring benefits from
international financial circles.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):

Minister Istemihan Talay who welcomed the Greek artists in Ankara.
There will be 40 works in display, 20 from Turkish and 20 from
Greek painters.
</P>

This move comes amid the atmosphere of friendship between the
two Aegean Sea neighbors, which appeared last summer when strong
earthquakes struck the two countries and both rushed to help each
other.

country to which Turkish workers have not gone, including some
whose names have rarely been mentioned.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Makes Progress in Education, Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has
been attaching importance to education and training, and made
progress in the sector.
</P>
<P>
State budget allocation to education rose from 10.8 percent in
1996 to 14.2 percent in 1999 and is estimated at 15 percent of the
national budget in 2000, according to Vietnam's official news
agency VNA.
</P>
<P>
Besides increasing budget for education, the Vietnamese
government has established a national educational council to study
major issues on education and training. Many legal documents on
education have been issued, particularly the Education Law which
was adopted by the National Assembly in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the education and training sector of the country
has made progress in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The number of provinces and cities achieving the national
standards of literacy and universal primary education increased
from 26 in 1996 to 57 in 1997, leaving only six percent of the
population illiterate.
</P>
<P>
The pre-school education system has been restored. About 40
percent of children aged between three and five went to
kindergarten in the 1998-1999 school-year.
</P>
<P>
On vocational training, the government has re-established the
Vocational Training General Department. The trainees numbered 700,
000 in 1999, an increase of 21 percent over 1998.
</P>
<P>
To further boost educational development, the government has
approved several projects to develop education in poor areas in
the Mekong Delta and mountainous provinces.
</P>
<P>
However, the shortage of teachers and poor teaching quality
still remain in various localities, especially in remote, isolated,
border and mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
The number of primary school pupils tops 10 million this
academic year while that of junior high school students is 5.78
million and senior high school students 1.95 million, 900,000 and
200,000 more than in the 1996-1997 school-year, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Manila Seeks Priority Hiring of Filipino Seafarers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
working to ensure the priority hiring of Filipino seafarers in the
global shipping industry through the inclusion of the country in
the"white list" of the International Maritime Organization (IMO),
a senior official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Vicente Rivera, secretary of the Department of the
Transportation and Communications, said in a radio interview that
the government is implementing more skills training programs and
rigid certification procedures to improve the quality of Filipino
seafarers.
</P>
<P>
"We can see that other countries recognize the skills of our
seafarers, that's why we are working together for the inclusion of
the Philippines in the IMO white list," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rivera said the inclusion of the country in the IMO white list
will "guarantee the employability" of Filipino seafarers in the
maritime sector.
</P>
<P>
Last November, the Philippines was reelected as a member of the
IMO council, a victory which Rivera said will help the Estrada
administration fulfill its commitment of safeguarding the welfare
of of the country's 250,000 seafarers.
</P>
<P>
During the 2lst session of the IMO held in London, the
Philippines retained its seat in the council for another two years
until 200l.
</P>
<P>
Rivera said the country's next major task is to secure a
position in the IMO White List, which will help further strengthen
the Philippines' position as a leading provider of world-class
seafarers.

<HEADLINE> Downsides of Globalization Should Be Addressed: Thai FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 14 (Xinhua) -- An important lesson from the
recent financial crisis is the need to address the downsides of
globalization and the systemic imbalances in the international
economic system, Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The trends of the global economy and their implications for
developing countries continue to be a source of grave concern," he
said, urging the ongoing 10th session of the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD X) to deliberate on
some downsides of globalization which he views as "incumbent."
</P>
<P>
Since the benefits of globalization have remained beyond the
reach of many developing countries, the Thai minister said, a
global approach to shape and manage the process of globalization
is needed so as to maximize the opportunities arising from the
process and minimize the risks involved so as to avert the problem
of marginalizaition.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the interactive debate of UNCTAD X, Surin said the
growing sceptism and anxiety regarding trade liberalization must
also be addressed so as to strengthen confidence in the
multilateral trading system as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He called for improving the existing international financial
system with a view to preventing the recurrence of financial
crisis, to provide better mechanisms for crisis management and
preventive measures.
</P>
<P>
The minister also urged to define development policies and
strategies which would help to attain a balance in the
relationship between liberalization, competitiveness and
development in order to strive for greater equity between nations.
</P>
<P>
In this context, Surin said, "the plan of action for UNCTAD
over the next four years will not only help force consensus on
global issues of concern but, more importantly, will serve to
increase the capacity of developing countries, particularly the
least developed countries, in their integration into the global
economy on an efficacious basis."
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD X, which opened on February 12 and will last till
February 19,is addressing the broad theme of "applying the lessons
of the past to make globalization an effective instrument for the
development of all countries and all peoples."

<HEADLINE> DPRK Calls For Respect to Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Developed countries should not
impose their values and economic mode on the developing countries
but rather respect their domestic strategies and policies suitable
to their specific conditions, Kang Jong Mo, Trade Minister of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In his speech delivered here at the third day of the 10th
Session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD X), Kang said that government responsibility and
regulatory function on economic management should remain as an
important means for developing nations in formulating and
implementing their domestic strategies for development.
</P>
<P>
International cooperation should "strictly" serve to support
the national economy and development capacity, he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the opportunities for growth and development
globalization provides, Kong said, most of the developing
countries do not benefit from its process, but rather become major
victims of it.
</P>
<P>
"The structural adjustment and deregulation pursued by
globalization generate new challenges and dangers by limiting and
weakening the governance of the developing countries and their
government-level policy means," he said.
</P>
<P>
The conditionalities applied by the developed countries in the
process of globalization in the fields of trade, investment and
finance are making headway towards political interference
infringing upon sovereignty of the national state.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that it is "unfair and unjust" to demand same
standards from the countries "who find themselves in seriously
inequitable economic relations due to their different level of
development."
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be geared to promote equality, social justice
and broad human development, not merely seeking simple economic
growth or efficiency, he said.

<HEADLINE> Nagasaki Residents Protest U.S. Warship's Port Call </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of local residents in
Japan's southwestern prefecture of Nagasaki staged a protest
Monday against a U.S. Navy warship's call at Nagasaki port,
according to a Kyodo News report.
</P>
<P>
Some 70 members from labor unions and peace groups gathered at
the southwestern Japanese port to protest against the four-day
visit of the 9,033-ton Aegis destroyer Decatur, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Do not let the military use the port in the city of Nagasaki
which suffered the A-bomb attack," the protesters shouted.
</P>
<P>
Nagasaki Governor Genjiro Kaneko and Nagasaki Mayor Itcho Ito
had asked the U.S. Consulate in Nagasaki to have the port call
canceled in consideration of the feelings of people in the city,
which was devastated by a U.S. atomic bomb during World War II.
</P>
<P>
The ship accompanied the nuclear aircraft carrier John C.
Stennis to Pusan, South Korea, last month and will head for the
Persian Gulf Thursday, U.S. military officials said.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Hard-liners Vow to Carry out Death Sentence on Rushdie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Iranian hard-liners on Monday
pledged again to carry out the decade-long death sentence on the
British writer Salaman Rushdie, despite the Iranian government had
promised not to send or encourage anyone to kill him.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Radio reported that the state-run Islamic Propagation
Organization (IPO), the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC)
and some foundations issued statements in support of the death
sentence on its 11th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
"The sacred fatwa or religious decree issued by Imam Khomeini
(late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini) against
Rushdie's life is irrevocable and must be carried out," the
statements said.
</P>
<P>
On February 14, 1989, Khomeini issued the fatwa against
Rushdie's life on the charge that his novel "the Satanic Verses"
insults Islamic Prophet Mohammad, and the Iranian private Khordad
15 Foundation offered an award of 2.8 million U.S. dollars to those
who would carry out the death sentence.
</P>
<P>
However, senior Iranian officials repeatedly stated that the
government would not send or encourage anyone to carry out
Khomeini's religious decree, but they also underlined that Tehran
can not revoke the death sentence.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Britain upgraded their long-strained relations to
ambassadorial level last May after Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi promised that his government would not take or support any
measures to threaten Rushdie's life.
</P>
<P>
But Iranian hard-line authorities and private organizations
slammed the government's stance and vowed to carry out the death
sentence.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Benefit From EU Debt Reduction Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is among other countries
likely to benefit from a one billion U.S. dollars debt reduction
strategy mooted by the European Union (EU) in partnership with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Under the initiative, Zambia will be able to repay its debts
without inhibiting expenditure on national priorities such as the
social sector, Zambia Daily Mail newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Zambia spends more on debt servicing than on
domestic expenditure, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted EU head of delegation in Zambia Jochen Krebs
as saying the EU has set aside one billion dollars to participate
in the debt reduction strategy for Highly Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC), adding that the World Bank and IMF were making a debt
sustainability analysis.
</P>
<P>
Depending on the results of this study and on the government's
continuing commitment to macro-economic reform, a decision could
be made on Zambia's eligibility for debt relief towards the middle
of this year.
</P>
<P>
Krebs said the majority of development assistance to Zambia
from the EU has been granted for over 10 years now. The exception
has been debt accumulated through the provision of risk capital by
the European Investment Bank.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Intensifies Fight Against Smuggling on Lake Victoria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
intensified its efforts against increasingly rampant smuggling
activities on the vast Lake Victoria in a move to stabilize the
domestic market, according to the East African weekly published
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Uganda had deployed up to 15 boats on the largest lake in
Africa to curb smuggling, making it more difficult for smugglers
to ferry goods across the lake to Uganda, an official with the
Ugandan Special Revenue Police Service was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
John Musinguzi, the police officer, said that anti-smuggling
personnel were also deployed on several islands in the lake to
monitor the movements of smugglers whose boats usually use the
Tanzanian waters before crossing into Ugandan territory.
</P>
<P>
These uninhabited islands used to be favorite staging posts for
the smugglers, the Nairobi-based weekly reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ugandan government troops and marine police are
also said to have offered a helping hand in curbing smuggling,
dealing a hard blow to timber and textile smugglers.
</P>
<P>
The main items smuggled into Uganda include vehicles, spare
parts, timber, petroleum products, cement, sugar, textiles and
clothes. The smuggled goods, much cheaper than those in Uganda's
markets, constitute one of the key factors destabilizing the
markets.
</P>
<P>
As a land-locked country, Uganda has to get its imports from
the Kenyan port of Mombasa or the Tanzanian port of Dar es Salaam.
 The high transport costs help make smuggling a very lucrative
business.

<HEADLINE> Owners of Ground for New U.S. Embassy Sue Tanzanian Govt. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Owners of an estate to
be used for the new U.S. embassy in Dar es Salaam have filed a
civil suit at the Tanzanian High Court contesting the government's
decision to revoke their title deed, media here reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Their court action is likely to stall plans by the U.S.
government to put up a 40-million-dollar permanent embassy complex
at a drive-in cinema ground that covers 21 acres in the city's
north Msasani area, the independent Guardian newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Tanzanian government made a prompt decision to
allocate the ground to the U.S. embassy, undercutting a hefty deal
that was being negotiated by former owners of the property.
</P>
<P>
Proprietors of the drive-in cinema demand more compensation for
their property, claiming that their title deed has been
transferred after it was illegally usurped by authorities.
</P>
<P>
Shareholders of the drive-in cinema reportedly started
negotiations with U.S. government officials last year to enable a
smooth transfer of the title deed for an agreed sum of money.
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. Ambassador in Tanzania Charles Stith, the
construction of the proposed embassy complex is due to take off
this year and it is scheduled for completion in November 2002.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has set up an independent commission last
November to see what needed to be done to improve security after
the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania killed at
least 226 people on August 7, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Famine Alert for Central Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Central Province is
facing severe famine following the current drought that has wiped
out almost three quarters of the maize crops in the province,
Daily Nation newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The provincial agricultural officer J.T. Muchoki said only a
paltry 200,000 bags (90 kg per bag) of maize may be harvested if
the rain falls soon, as against the yield target of 750,000 bags
for the planting season set previously.
</P>
<P>
Muchoki observed that this has been occasioned by the continued
failure of the short rains expected to fall in the
November-February period.
</P>
<P>
"The drought had led to the failure of an entire maize crop in
some areas and most of the districts are not expected to harvest
even half of the projected yields," he added.
</P>
<P>
Muchoki said his province which has relied on maize imports in
the past will be forced to import even more as the deficit will be
higher.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the United Nations World Food Program (WFP)
appealed to donors for 43.4 million U.S. dollars for over two
million Kenyans who need food aid after the dire effects of
drought in large parts of the country, especially in northern and
northeastern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
WFP said that the money needed for 75,000 tons of food for 2.7
million Kenyans over the next five months was in response to an
appeal by the Kenyan government in December.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Current-Account Surplus Dips in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Japan's current-account surplus
in 1999 fell 22.7 percent from the previous year to 12,197.2
billion yen or 107 billion U.S. dollars for the first decline in
three years, the Finance Ministry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The shrinkage was attributed to a steeper plunge in exports,
said the ministry in a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
Goods and services trade in 1999 resulted in a surplus of 7,871.
9 billion yen (69.1 billion dollars), down 17.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The surplus in merchandise trade dropped 12.1 percent to 14,054.
0 billion yen (123.4 billion dollars), with exports down 6.3
percent to 45,768.8 billion yen (401.7 billion dollars) and
imports down 3.5 percent to 31,714.8 billion yen (278.4 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The drop in exports is largely due to the yen's sharp rise
against the dollar, while the pace of decline in imports slowed
from the previous year's 11.6 percent partly because of higher
crude oil prices, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Japan posted a deficit of 6,182.1 billion yen (54.3
billion dollars) in services trade, down from 6,454.6 billion yen
(56.7 billion dollars) a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Japan's current-account balance gauges the difference between a
nation's income from foreign sources and foreign obligations
payable, excluding net capital investment.
</P>
<P>
The yen averaged 113.94 to the dollar in 1999, compared with
131.02 yen in 1998.

<HEADLINE> More Suzhou Gardens Likely to Be Put on World Heritage List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The city of Suzhou, known as "
Venice in the Orient" because of its landscaped gardens, is
striving to put five more of the gardens on the UNESCO's World
Heritage list.
</P>
<P>
The five gardens are Canglangting, Shizilin, Yipu, Ouyuan, and
Tuisi.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said the city has filed applications to UNESCO
while carefully maintaining these gardens.
</P>
<P>
Suzhou gardens, famous for their delicate design, usually with
hills and ponds, pavilions, terraces, corridors and towers, can be
dated back to as early as about 514 B.C. when the city was built.
There were as many as 200 gardens dotted in the city in its prime
during the 16th to 18th centuries.
</P>
<P>
The gardens have long been considered as the quintessence of
Chinese horticulture. The World Heritage Committee refers to
Suzhou as the cradle of horticulture in the world.
</P>
<P>
Four of the gardens, Zhuozheng, Liuyuan, Wangshi, and Huanxiu,
were put on the World Heritage list in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
The city plans to put a total of 27 gardens on the list.

KQ431, plunged into sea just after its take-off in Abidjan,
capital of Cote d'Ivoire, on January 30, killing 169 people on
board.

The airline made the announcement Sunday after the divers

while 28 still not identified.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Airways Managing Director Richard Nyaga said the end of
the search was agreed upon between his company and the victims'
families.
</P>
<P>
"As an African airline, we understand the pain and anguish of
the families. That is why this has been the longest search for
bodies in history of such disasters," media here Monday quoted
Nyaga as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that his airline would pay 50 million shillings
(around 680,000 U.S. dollars) to Octo-Marine for its six-day

The cost since the crash occurred are very high and may run

<HEADLINE> Voting On Zimbabwe's Draft Constitution Ends Peacefully: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Mariyawanda Nzuwah, chairman of
the Election Directorate of Zimbabwe, has described the just
ended voting on draft constitution throughout the country as
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
He said due to the communication and weather problems, it was
enable to give the figures of the ballots cast. However, he said
the voting results might be come out later Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here on Sunday night, Nzuwah
said: "The level of voter turnout was about the same as
Saturday's, as it was slow in the morning and picking up in the
afternoon."
</P>
<P>
Police Commissioner Augustine Chihuri said that the voting
process was peaceful except for a few people who were arrested for
contravening the electoral law.
</P>
<P>
But Nzuwah said the commission had the problem of getting all
the figures because of communication problems as in some cases
vehicles were stuck in mud.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the rainy weather, the situation was not conducive
for provincial command teams to give all the figures on the
voting." Hopefully by Monday "we should be able to give figures,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said voting ended on Sunday evening with the various
presiding officers, monitors, observers, press and police
witnessing the sealing of the ballot boxes.
</P>
<P>
Registrar-General Tobaiwa Mudede said, "Under normal
circumstances results start coming at 11:00 am on Monday but with
the current weather I am unable to say when exactly."
</P>
<P>
The draft constitution, the subject of the weekend referendum,
if passed into law, will replace the current constitution drafted
at the Lancaster House conference.
</P>
<P>
The draft supreme law proposes the retention of an executive
president who shares power with a prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Other highlights include the return to a two-chamber Parliament
 consisting of a National Assembly and a Senate and the
introduction of proportional representation in the Lower House.
</P>
<P>
The draft also seeks to put to rest the contentious land issue
by giving the government the right to acquire land for
resettlement without paying compensation, except for improvements
on the holdings.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the draft have been urging people to vote "yes"
because the proposed supreme law gives them sovereignty and the
opportunity to break away from the colonial past.
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the proposed constitution were arguing that the
president would still have too much power and that the draft
ignored the wishes of the people.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Seeks $70M for Poverty Alleviation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) needs an estimated investment of at
least 70 million U.S. dollars to fully address the issue of
poverty in the region, COMESA Secretary-General Erastus Mwencha
said.
</P>
<P>
The investment is required for capacity utilization, job
creation, as well as expanding the market for the region's
finished products, the Times of Zambia newspaper Monday quoted
Mwencha as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that over 150 million of the nearly 400 million
people in the region are living under poverty line.
</P>
<P>
"To fully address the issue of poverty, there is great need for
COMESA member states to attract more foreign investment by
developing a large market for its finished products," Mwencha said
at a workshop on opportunities and challenges of the COMESA Free
Trade Area (FTA) in Ndola, Copperbelt Province, at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The creation of a large market would lead to higher economic
growth and employment generation for the benefit of the region's
population, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Mwencha noted that Zambia, like any other member
state, could not offer a large market for the attraction of
foreign investment on its own, hence the need for the 21-member
grouping to find regional solutions.
</P>
<P>
He said the COMESA FTA was a strategy that could afford small
and poor nations in the region to create a large single economic
space that could allow the maximization of social economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA is aiming to achieve a free trade area by October 31
this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 14 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's tourism account
balance turned red last month, the first time in 27 months, the
Bank of Korea said Monday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 432,000 foreign visitors spent 428 million U.S.
dollars in South Korea in January while the outlay of 312,00 South
Korean overseas travelers amounted to 479 million.
</P>
<P>
The last time that showed tourism account in red was October
1997, a month before the financial crisis, which was caused by
corporate failures and bad loans of financial institutions in late
1997.
</P>
<P>
After the crisis, the number of South Korean overseas travelers
plunged but it started to rise again in the second quarter of last
year, soaring by 40 percent for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the central bank said that the number of foreign
visitors decreased last month owing to fears of Y2K computer
glitch and lack of available accommodations.

<P>
The 1992 Barcelona gold medalist was allowed to use state-run
facilities but Athletics Australia has asked the IAAF for
clarification on whether or not the doping ban should extend to
Christie's status as coach.
</P>
<P>
Athletics Australia doping control commission chief Brian Roe
said his organization did not have the jurisdiction to ban the 39-
year-old Briton from coaching in Australia.
</P>
<P>
At its council meeting Saturday in Monaco, the IAAF decided to
suspend Christie and other high-profile athletes including
Jamaican Merlene Ottey, until it can hold arbitration hearings on
their doping cases.
</P>
<P>
Ottey and Christie are among a group of athletes who have
tested positive for the banned steroid nandrolone with increasing
speculation that nutritional supplements are producing the
positive nandrolone findings.
</P>
<P>
Christie has denied ever taking performance enhancing drugs. He
retired in 1997 but still competes.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Arms Exports Record High Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 14 (Xinhua) -- South Korean weapons exports set
a record of 197 million U.S. dollars in 1999, a Defense Ministry
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the weapons went to more than 20 Southeast Asian and
Latin American countries. The arms deal included a 57-million-
dollar warship to Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
This year's exports will far exceed 200 million dollars, said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the sharp rise in weapons exports to
combined efforts by the government, arms manufacturers and
military attaches stationed abroad.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said it is strengthening international cooperation
in the defense material-manufacturing sector and plans to sign
agreements on defense industry cooperation with Bangladesh,
Australia and Brazil this year.
</P>
<P>
"We also plan to ink pacts on quality assurance or exchanges of
science and technology data with Thailand, Venezuela, Israel and
France this year," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Seoul has been promoting weapons shipments as part of its goal
to develop the defense industry. Arms deals now include military
vessels, vehicles and missile parts.
</P>
<P>
The United States and some other countries have reportedly been
sensitive to South Korea's arms exports.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's weapons exports soared from 45 million dollars in
1996 to 58 million in 1997 and 147 million in 1998, when it sold a
2,000-ton frigate worth 100 million dollars to Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said the country recorded more than 200 million
dollars worth of arms deals in 1984 due to special demands created
by the Iran-Iraq war.

<HEADLINE> West Beats East 137-126 in NBA All-Star Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
OAKLAND, California, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Shaquille O'Neal
and Tim Duncan combined for 46 points and 23 rebounds as the
Western Conference stopped a three-game losing streak with a 137-
126 win over the East in Sunday's NBA All-Star Game here Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
Allen Iverson, who leads the NBA in scoring, poured in a game-
high 26 points for the East, which still leads the series 31-18.
Kobe Bryant added 15 points for the West, while Michael Finley and
Jason Kidd had 11 apiece.
</P>
<P>
Shaq, who performed in the All-Star Game in his seventh time,
scored 22 points and grabbed nine rebounds in 25 minutes. Duncan
netted 24 points and snatched 14 rebounds in 33 minutes. The two
giants shared the MVP award in the 49th game.
</P>
<P>
Phil Jackson said after the win:"Our advantage is the size;
their advantage are speed and 3-point shooters, outside game. We
had to keep them out in the middle and at least make difficult
passes for them to reach the 3-point shot." He pointed out that
the most highlight in the game was Duncan's left-handed dunk at
the end of the game.
</P>
<P>
"Shaq's a force to deal with night in and night out," Duncan
said of his co-winner.
</P>
<P>
"You don't see many MVP guys who can go inside and outside," O
'Neal said, returning the praise.
</P>
<P>
 It marked just the third time in All-Star history there had
been a co-MVP and first since 1993 when Utah teammates Karl Malone
and John Stockton shared the award following the game at Salt Lake
City.
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal didn't even play the fourth quarter because he had a
sore shoulder. He dribbled coast-to-coast for a finger roll layin
in the first half.
</P>
<P>
"I told Kobe (Bryant) if I got a break, I'd do something nasty.
I was going to windmill but my shoulder gave out, so I just did a
little 360," O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
Duncan's steady play that led the Spurs to their first title
last year was evident all day as he hit 12-of-14 shots.
</P>
<P>
Vince Carter said:"A little too much emphasis on the dunk
contest. But I was excited about the All-Star Game, that's the
chance of a lifetime."
</P>
<P>
Kevin Garnett also showed a strong performance tonight by
getting 24 points and 10 rebounds for the West in 35 minutes.

<HEADLINE> hke021417-- Debate on New Zealand Currency Called </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Adopting a currency like
the American greenback or joining a monetary union should be
considered to stop volatility in the New Zealand currency and
avoid interest rate rises, Richard Prebble, leader of ACT NZ, an
opposition party in the parliament, was Monday quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion reported that the parliament member has called on
the government to examine both options, saying monetary
independence carries a high price and he wants to re-ignite debate
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The issue on a monetary union with Australia or the United
States was hotly debated, but the debate led to no conclusion last
year.
</P>
<P>
Prebble noted that the volatility of the New Zealand dollar
makes it almost impossible for New Zealand exporters to accurately
anticipate currency swings.
</P>
<P>
"It might actually be the biggest reason why New Zealand
exports haven't grown in the way we would have expected in the
last 30 years,"he was quoted as saying by the Wellington-based
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand dollar, floundering around 14-year lows at 49 U.
S. cents, has shed more than 3 U.S. cents in the past month,
registering a fall of about 6 percent. Interest rate rises are
expected as a result.
</P>
<P>
"In manufacturing the return is often as low as 4 percent. When
you have a dollar that is capable of losing 4 percent in a night,
there is no hedging program for that," Prebble said.
</P>
<P>
He added: "Every single one of our principal exporters has lost
very large sums of money trying to predict where the New Zealand
dollar is going. So I think it is a debate we ought to have."
</P>
<P>
Prebble prefers adopting the U.S. dollar to a monetary union
with Australia.
</P>
<P>
"The Australians in world terms have a tiny currency as well.
And while it would give us some protection for our trade with
Australia,we do far more trade with the whole world than we do
with Australia,"he said.
</P>
<P>
"One of the leading economic debates around the world is the
question of the viability of small currencies in a global economy,
"Prebble stressed.
</P>
<P>
Bill English, finance spokesman of the National Party, the main
opposition party in the parliament, said it is important that the
pros and cons of a monetary union are debated, but he believes
that the debate should occur outside the political arena first.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for New Zealand Finance Minister Michael Cullen
said that examining the possibility of a monetary union is not on
the government's agenda. The government has more important issues
to attend to, she added.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Minister of Home
Affairs Surjadi Soedirja has been appointed interim coordinating
minister for political and security affairs, succeeding General
Wiranto who has been suspended, a presidential spokesman said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"For the sake of the government stability, as well as for
Wiranto's own interests, the president has decided to suspend him
as the coordinating minister for political and security affairs,"
said spokesman Marsilam Simanjuntak.
</P>
<P>
"He has been replaced by an interim minister, namely Home
Affairs Minister Surjadi Soedirja," said Simanjuntak at the
presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
Simanjuntak said the latest decision was a consensus between
President Abdurrahman Wahid, Vice President Megawati Soekarnoputri,
Attorney General Marzuki Darusman and Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
Previously, Simanjuntak on Sunday announced that President
Wahid had agreed to keep Wiranto in his cabinet pending a probe to
be conducted by the Attorney General's Office to decide whether
Wiranto must be brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto was the commander of the country's armed forces when
mass violence erupted in East Timor in the wake of the U.N.-
sponsored ballot in August 1999.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokesman said, the president also has appointed
Bondan Gunawan the state secretary, succeeding Ali Rahman.
</P>
<P>
Both Soedirja and Gunawan are scheduled to be inaugurated on
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh, EU to Sign New Cooperation Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- A new cooperation agreement
between Bangladesh and the European Union (EU) will be signed in
Brussels on March 20, EU Ambassador to Bangladesh Antonio de
Menezes was quoted Monday by The Independent daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said the new accord, replacing the one now in
force and signed in 1976, would boost cooperation in trade,
investment and economic development.
</P>
<P>
The new agreement is a comprehensive one compared with the one
now in force which basically provides for cooperation in economy,
science, culture, human resource development and intellectual
property rights.
</P>
<P>
The most significant feature of this agreement is a punitive
clause which makes development assistance dependent on the
promotion of democracy and human rights. Any gross violation may
lead to the suspension of EU assistance to Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Commerce Minister Abdul Jalil will visit Brussels to
sign the final documents in March.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian FM Confirms Wiranto Deactivation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister
Alwi Shihab Monday confirmed reports that Coordinating Minister
for Political and Security Affairs General Wiranto has been
deactivated.
</P>
<P>
He described the president's decision as "a middle course,"
saying this is a temporary step to avoid the dismissal of Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions, Alwi refused to rule out the possibility
that Wiranto will resume the ministerial post.
</P>
<P>
President Abdurrahman Wahid deactivated Wiranto from his
position as coordinating minister for political and security
affairs on Sunday night. The head of state installed Home Minister
Surjadi Soedirdja to replace Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto's suspension aims to maintain the neutrality of the
current legal process carried out by the Attorney General's office,
the president was quoted by national newspapers Monday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto had earlier been requested by the president to resign
from his cabinet post after a government-sanctioned East Timor
post-ballot atrocities inquiry team formally implicated him in the
mayhem.
</P>
<P>
However, Wiranto, who refused to resign, firmly rejected
allegations that Indonesian servicemen had not done much in
maintaining security before and during the process of the August
30 U.N.-organized vote which was won by the anti-integration camp.

<HEADLINE> Former Indonesian President Fails to Appear for Questioning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Former Indonesian President
Soeharto failed to appear on Monday for questioning by the
Attorney General's Office.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers representing the 78-year-old former president told
reporters that their client was too sick to answer the summons.
</P>
<P>
The Attorney General's Office last Thursday announced that it
would summon Soeharto on Monday for further investigation on
alleged corruption.
</P>
<P>
Since Soeharto stepped down from the presidency in May 1998,
there has been a public outcry, demanding that he be put on trial
for alleged corruption during his rule.
</P>
<P>
Last year, investigation into Soeharto was ceased by the then
Acting Attorney General Ismudjoko due to "lack of evidences."
</P>
<P>
The move, however, triggered anger from many parties nationwide
who believed that Soeharto was responsible for rampant corruption
in the country during his 32-year rule.
</P>
<P>
The incumbent Attorney General Marzuki Darusman decided in
December last year to reopen the Soeharto case, saying his office
had found new evidences.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, who has repeatedly denied allegations that he amassed
a fortune during his reign, was hospitalized twice last year after
suffering a stroke and intestinal bleeding.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Urges U.N. to Call Urgent Meeting on Kosovo Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia on Sunday urged
the U.N. Security Council to hold an urgent meeting to discuss the
situation in the Kosovo town of Mitrovica, where tension is on the
rise following a spate of terrorist acts by ethnic Albanian
separatists.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.N. chief Kofi Annan and President of the
Security Council Arnoldo Manuellistre, Yugoslav ambassador to the
United Nations Vladislav Jovanovich demanded that the U.N.
Security Council take "forceful measures so that the attacks by
the Albanian terrorists against the defenseless Serbian population
(in the town) cease immediately and that long-term consequences
are avoided," Yugoslav state-run news agency Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
A series of violence targeting at Serbian residents in
Mitrovica by ethnic Albanian terrorists have occurred after the
beginning of the month when a group of ethnic Albanian extremists
attacked a small bar in the Serbian quarters in the town, injuring
12 Serbs.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian terrorists also clashed with the NATO-led
peacekeeping force in Kosovo (KFOR), wounding altogether 13 French
soldiers so far.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, Albanian extremists fired at French
peacekeepers near the main bridge separating the two rival ethnic
groups of Serbs and Albanians in Mitrovica, leaving two French
peacekeepers and four Serb residents injured.
</P>
<P>
In return, the French peacekeeping troops shot one Albanian
sniper dead and injured five, bringing the situation under control
by noon.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on the same day, KFOR noted that the
snipers were all ethnic Albanians, whose goal is to undermine the
achievements that have been so far made by the international
community.
</P>
<P>
In another development in the evening, a train entering
Mitrovica was attacked and an American peacekeeper was wounded.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovich also expressed concern in the letter over the
connivance of the British and German peecekeeping troops in the
ethnically-troubled Yugoslav province at the crimes of the
Albanian terrorists, saying they actually "encouraged the criminal
attacks of the terrorist groups of the so-called KLA (Kosovo
Liberation Army)."
</P>
<P>
He described Mitrovica's dire situation and the casualties,
caused by "the organized assault" of the Albanian terrorists, as
the result of the "systematic" violation by the KFOR and the U.N.
special mission in Kosovo of the U.N. Resolution 1244 and the
military agreement signed by Yugoslavia and NATO last June,
especially because of the failure to disarm the KLA.
</P>
<P>
The Interim Administration Council of Yugoslavia, set up to
work together with the U.N. special mission to govern Kosovo after
the end of NATO's 78-day bombing on Yugoslavia last June, also
issued on the same day a statement at an urgent meeting, strongly
protesting against the U.N. mission and KFOR.
</P>
<P>
It said that the U.N. mission and KFOR have turned a deaf ear
to the council's earlier warning that Albanian separatists and
terrorists were ready to force into the Serb-populated area of
Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
The council strongly appealed the U.N. mission and KFOR to take
all imperative steps immediately to arrest the peacebreakers for
their crimes and stabilize the situation in Kosovo in the shortest
time.
</P>
<P>
The city council of the Serbs in Mitrovica also called an
urgent meeting to condemn ethnic Albanian terrorists' latest
attacks against the Serbs and the French peacekeepers.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Import 800 Buses From India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Minister of
Transport A.H.M. Fowzie has decided to import 800 buses from India
despite mounting protests by local companies, press reports said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The minister proposed to introduce the 800 buses for rural
routes which require smaller buses within this year, said The
Island newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the Ministry of Transport ordered 1,000 new buses, half
of them from TATA Bus Company of India in preference to Sri Lankan
companies Latec, Wesco and Ceymo of the Ceylinco Group as the
Indian buses are cheaper.
</P>
<P>
However, later Latec granted 300 buses and Ceymo 200 buses to
the ministry.
</P>
<P>
With the minister's refusal to purchase the buses from local
assemblies, a demonstration was staged last week by employees of
Latec demanding that the buses be purchased from local companies.
</P>
<P>
The minister, however, has said he will not change his decision
as the local company Ceylinco had priced its buses at 35,000
rupees (500 U.S. dollars) higher than the Indian company and Wesco
had asked 400,000 rupees (5,700 dollars) more for each bus.
</P>
<P>
Fowzie pointed out that the ministry could buy 1,250 buses from
India with the money to buy only 1,000 buses from Wesco.

<HEADLINE> China to Import More Crude Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- China will increase crude oil
imports this year, but the import of oil products will still be
banned, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The move is based on an oil shortage in the domestic market and
the country's refining capacity surplus, said sources with the
State Administration of Petroleum and Chemical Industries (SAPCI).
</P>
<P>
Although China is now the world's fifth largest oil producer,
it must turn to oil imports to meet the mounting domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
To fuel the country's economic growth this year, which is
anticipated to strike 7 percent or higher, the domestic oil demand
will rise at least 4 percent, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The imported oil will move a bit higher than that of last year
to more than 40 million tons, said Chen Yongwu, an SAPCI official.
</P>
<P>
China imported 38 million tons of crude oil in 1999. And the
imported oil will come from the Middle East and Southeast Asia, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"China is also attempting to pump more crude oil at home to
alleviate the oil supply shortage," the official said. But he
still predicted an enlarging gap between oil demand and domestic
output.
</P>
<P>
China's oil demand is likely to approach 300 million tons in 10
years with its rapid economic growth, insiders said, noting that
China will continue to be a net oil importer, a situation that has
been lingering for more than six years.
</P>
<P>
"However, we can fully guarantee that there will be enough oil
products on the domestic market this year, making import
unnecessary," Chen stressed.
</P>
<P>
China has used only 66 percent of its oil refining capacity,
enough to meet the domestic demand for oil products, which expects
to be 101 million tons this year.
</P>
<P>
China's current refining capacity amounts to 260 million tons,
ranking the fourth in the world. And there are still large
quantities of oil products in short supply nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The government is encouraging domestic refineries to process
imported crude oil, the official said, adding that the ban on oil
product imports, which was implemented about one and a half years
ago, is expected to help the refineries earn more profits this
year as oil product prices remain stable.

<HEADLINE> Duplicate Investment Should Be Avoided in Western China Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Structural readjustments
should be intensified and duplicate investment avoided during the
strategic development of Western China, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Li Rongrong, vice-minister of the State Economic and Trade
Commission (SETC), said here on Sunday that his commission would
help those advantageous industries in western China foster
industrial upgrading.
</P>
<P>
Occupying 5.4 million square kilometers, western China has a
population of about 300 million and includes Shaanxi, Yunnan,
Sichuan, Guizhou, Gansu, and Qinghai provinces, Tibet, Xinjiang
Uygur and Ningxia Hui autonomous regions, and Chongqing
Municipality.
</P>
<P>
Despite their larger areas and rich natural resources, the
economy in western China has long been hindered by lag of
infrastructure facilities.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, increasing infrastructure construction is the basic
element for development in western China, Li said, adding that
provinces and autonomous regions in western China have begun large-
scale development projects.
</P>
<P>
The SETC will help related provinces and autonomous regions
work out plans to restructure their economies this year, and give
more favorable treatments to enterprises in the areas in an effort
to reform large and medium-sized State-owned enterprises, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He also required that personnel education and training in
western China be further developed to cultivate outstanding
entrepreneurs.

<HEADLINE> Expert Calls for High Quality Grain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- An expert from the Development
and Research Center (DRC) of the State Council today has urged to
raise the quality of China's crops by readjusting the agricultural
structure, today's China Daily said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xiwen, a research fellow with the DRC, said that current
farm produce can not meet today's requirements, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that with increasing incomes, the general Chinese
public spend more money to improve their living standards. They
need high-quality wholesome food.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, China has had four successive good harvests with
annual grain surplus of millions of tons. Nevertheless, higher-
grade grain varieties are still lacking. Low-grade grain that
sells poorly has constituted a considerably large proportion of
China's enormous yield. China has to import some grains, such as
high-quality special wheat and corn to meet its domestic demand.
In 1997, most farm products became difficult to sell. Price
declines have remanded for three years.
</P>
<P>
As grain production has increase dramatically, the past
development mode which targeted the production volume can not meet
the changing demands. And it fails to satisfy farmer' wishes to
earn a decent living, said Chen.
</P>
<P>
But the surplus will offer a golden opportunity for the
agriculture sector to change its growth mode from the extensive to
the intensive, he added.
</P>
<P>
To raise the quality of produce and increase profitability, the
product mix should be optimized and local advantages should be
fully utilized. The construction of high-quality and high-yield
farming bases should be intensified.
</P>
<P>
More efforts should be concentrated on the food processing
industry to raise the value of products and develop new market, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Chen also suggest the government promote the development of
small towns and township enterprises to absorb the redundant rural
labor forces.
</P>
<P>
But he also warned that China should not ignore grain
production after years of good harvests.

<HEADLINE> Former Indonesian Military Chief Deactivated: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid has decided to deactivate Coordinating Minister
for Political and Security Affairs General Wiranto, according to
the Media Indonesia Monday.
</P>
<P>
The president also designated Minister of Home Affairs Surjadi
Sudirdja as ad interim coordinating minister for political and
security affairs, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The president stated on Sunday that he would allow Wiranto to
remain in the cabinet, pending a probe into his alleged
involvement in last year's East Timor violence by the Attorney-
General's Office.
</P>
<P>
Wahid, fresh from his 16-day whirlwind trip overseas, defended
his decision, saying he had to give Wiranto the opportunity to go
through the legal process.
</P>
<P>
The president said on Sunday that Wiranto would be removed from
his post only if the Attorney General's Office found in its
investigation that Wiranto was responsible for what transpired in
East Timor following the August ballot, which resulted in
overwhelming rejection of Jakarta's offer of wide-ranging autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto was chief of the Indonesian Military when atrocities
were reportedly committed by Indonesian troops during and after
the ballot in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
But the president told the Media Indonesia on Sunday night that
in order to facilitate the probe he had decided to deactivate
Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Wahid as saying that he will issue a decree
soon.

PARIS, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Marc Rosset won the first all-
Swiss final of an ATP Tour tournament by beating compatriot Roger
Federer 2-6, 6-3, 7-6 in the Marseille Open tennis final in
Marseille on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Rosset, winner in Marseille in 1993 and 1994, improved his
serve after losing the first set.
</P>
<P>
In the early stages of the match, Federer showed why he had
been crowned junior world champion in 1998, unsettling Rosset with
his devastating forehands.
</P>
<P>
But Rosset finally took control of the match, winning the tie-
breaker of the third set 7-5.

PARIS, February 13 (Xinhua) -- French veteran Nathalie Tauziat
beat injured Serena Williams of the United States 7-5, 6-2 to take
the Paris Open women's tennis title on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Williams, top seed and title holder in the
tournament, had to receive treatment early in the second set.
</P>
<P>
Tauziat, the former Wimbledon finalist, did not give the
American a chance to breathe in the first set, rushing to the net
at every opportunity. The tactics paid off when she broke Williams
in the third game.
</P>
<P>
Williams reacted but bowed again in the 11th game, allowing
Tauziat to serve for the set.
</P>
<P>
After receiving treatment in the second set, Williams appeared
slow in movement with a bandaged knee and quickly lost the set.

<HEADLINE> Cameroon Snatches African Nations Cup on Narrow Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Cameroon Sunday in Lagos made a
narrow win under the cloud of a controversial penalty shoot-out,
by drawing Nigeria 2-2 first and beating it 4-3 latter on
penalties in the final of the 22nd African Cup of Nations.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's showdown between the two African football superpowers
in a well packed Lagos's stadium, made a true exciting drama by
Cameroon's early two goals lead and Nigeria's impressive catch-up.
</P>
<P>
Cameroon threatened a runaway victory after goals by Samuel Eto
'o of Real Madrid in the 26th minute and a second five minutes
later, by Patrick Mboma.
</P>
<P>
But the goals seemed to spark the home side into life and
Raphael Chukwu in injury time before the end of the first half
pulled back a goal for the cup's co-host.
</P>
<P>
Minutes into the second half, brilliance of Austin Okocha was
underlined by a ferocious equalizer from outside the area that
gave goalkeeper Boukar Alioum no chance.
</P>
<P>
The eagles and lions fought into the extra time, although
neither side could find the net through the other's often fragile
defence and the clash dissolved into scrappy exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Both teams started confidently in the penalty shoot-out,
scoring with their first two kicks.
</P>
<P>
But Alioum saved from Arsenal's Nwankwo Kanu, the reigning
African Footballer of the Year. Geremi Fotso Njitap's effort gave
Cameroon a 3-2 lead before Ikpeba's controversial attempt.
</P>
<P>
The fourth penalty of Super Eagles by Victor Ikeba hit the
crossbar and was disallowed, while Nigerian television's video
replays showed that it had in fact crossed the line.
</P>
<P>
Then Comeroon's Captain Rigobert Song converted the winning
spot kick to ensure a 4-3 win
</P>
<P>
Marc-Vivien Foe could have sealed the cup for Cameroon with
their fourth kick but hit his shot wide and it was left to Song to
seal victory after Nigeria's captain Sunday Oliseh had levelled
the count at 3-3.
</P>
<P>
Some Nigerian players burst into tears when they were invited
to accept their medals on their second-place platform.

<P>
YINCHUAN, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Electricity has recently been
sent to another 203 villages in one of the poorest areas in
northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, more than 310 villages in the
Guyuan Prefecture, of one third of the total villages in the area,
have access to electricity. By the end of the year, the remaining
villages will also have access.

<P>
Electricity supply to the area is part of poverty relief
efforts undertaken by the regional government to lift the
mountainous area out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the regional government invested nearly 10 million
yuan (1.2 million US dollars) connecting electricity to villages
and households at the foot of Liupan Mountain in the prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Guyuan Prefecture is one of the poorest areas in China. For more

HANGZHOU, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The world's first

According to Huang, an anti-weedicide gene was used in
developing the new strain, which is resistant to weed killing
chemicals.

Huang said that herbicides can kill weeds and low-quality rice
but leave the new strain of rice intact, thus improving rice
output and quality.

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Teaching Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of
Education will be requiring teachers to have more professional
training and undergo vigorous job evaluation in a bid to improve
quality of teaching in the country.
</P>
<P>
When the new school term begins later this month, education
officials will launch a nationwide inquiry into the competence of
China's teachers.
</P>
<P>
The evaluation will be a factor in determining whether teachers
get promoted, the English-language newspaper China Daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
And a competitive system will be introduced to employ teachers.
Those deemed incompetent will be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
The move is meant to spur educators to develop better teaching
methods and to help resolve long-standing concerns that students
are given too much homework.
</P>
<P>
Reducing students' homework so that they are under less stress
is one of the ministry's major goals this year.
</P>
<P>
For years, China's primary and middle schools have been
criticized fro emphasizing rote learning and for piling homework
on students. Teachers believe that more homework would mean higher
scores in examinations.
</P>
<P>
The higher marks benefited not just students. Teachers could
also get raises or promotions if their students did well.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey found that more than 67 percent of urban
students and 45 percent of rural students spend more than an hour
on homework per day, exceeding the State-set standard of 30
minutes.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- One goal from Titi Camara gave
Liverpool a 1-0 victory at Arsenal in an English premier league
match on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The hard-earned victory puts Gerard Houllier's side on 47
points from 25 matches. Champions Manchester United lead with 53
points from 24 matches and Leeds United are second, three points
behind.
</P>
<P>
Talk of the title has now disappeared completely for Arsenal
and manager Arsene Wenger conceded that it would be "very
difficult" even to haul his team back into one of the three
Champions League places by the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal's Thierry Henry went agonisingly close to breaking the
deadlock after 12 minutes, thundering in a shot from 25 metres.
</P>
<P>
The ball moved around in the air and Liverpool goalkeeper
Sander Westerweld did well to thrust up an arm and palm it away.
</P>
<P>
Six minutes later, though, Gerard Houllier's visitors took the
lead courtesy of Camara.
</P>
<P>
The striker raced on to Steven Gerrard's looped ball over the
top to spring Arsenal's off-side trap and go one-on-one with David
Seaman, beating the England goalkeeper at his left-hand post.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal piled on the pressure in the second half but Liverpool'
s defence held solid.
</P>
<P>
Henry missed a golden opportunity to level matters when his
header shaved the crossbar in the 78th minute and four minutes
later Marc Overmars's shot on the turn missed by centimeters.

<HEADLINE> PNA Bars Israeli Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) has decided to deny access of Israeli commodities to the
Palestinian self-rule areas as of February 14 in protest against
Israel's decision to close Erez checkpoint to Palestinian trucks.
</P>
<P>
All Palestinian economic and trade circles stopped cooperation
with the Israeli side as a reaction to the recent Israeli decision,
Voice of Palestine radio reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli decision provides that Carny checkpoint will replace
Erez in handling Palestinian trucks as of March 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Chambers of Commerce Federation (PCCF) decided
to bar four kinds of Israeli products, namely biscuits, chocolates,
beverages and electrical appliances, Chief of Palestinian Chamber
of Commerce Mohammed Al-Qodwah was quoted by the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The PCCF and other economic groups in the self-rule areas
decided to stop importing any Israeli products except through
Palestinian importers or agents.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official accused that the Israeli decision is
aimed at isolating the Gaza Strip and strangling the economy of
more than one million Palestinians, or 40 percent of the population
of Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
He termed the Israeli decision as "a harsh blow to the PNA" as
it infringes on the political, economic and social aspects of life
of the Palestinian self-rule areas and will eventually make the
Palestinian economy dependent on Israel's.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli move will also lead to a price hike which will
increase the burden of Palestinian people, especially the Gaza
Strip residents, he added.
</P>
<P>
The transport fees on Israeli fleet through Carny checkpoint are
100 to 120 percent higher than those for Erez checkpoint, he noted,
pointing out that it is the Palestinian consumers who will foot the
bill.

<HEADLINE> Former U.N. Envoy Sees No Hope for Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Hans von Sponeck, former U.N.
humanitarian coordinator in Iraq, said on Monday he has resigned
his post because he can not see any hope of any improvements in the
humanitarian conditions in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CNN (Cable News Network), Sponeck, who
tendered his resignation last weekend, said "I feel someone has to
come here with more optimism than I have in thinking that the
period ahead will bring relief for the humanitarian situation in
this country."
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who is on a visit in
Singapore, has accepted the resignation. Sponeck's replacement has
not been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The 61-year-old German, who resigned entirely from the United
Nations where he had served more than 30 years, said the oil-for-
food program he headed has not met the minimum requirements of the
22 million Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
He was appointed in October 1998 to run the program which allows
Iraq to sell limited amount of oil in every six months to buy
humanitarian goods under U.N. supervision.
</P>
<P>
Sponeck has been under mounting pressure from the United States
and Britain for his criticism of the crippling sanctions on Iraq
which has been in place since 1990 after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He angered the U.S. and Britain for repeatedly calling on the
Security Council to seperate Iraq's humanitarian needs from the aim
to eliminate the country's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged the regime of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
shares the blame for the continuation of the sanctions.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Provides Grant to Help Protect Mekong River Basin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced
Monday that it has approved a Global Environment Facility grant of
11 million U.S. dollars to support the Mekong River Commission (
MRC) in promoting and improving sustainable water management in
the Mekong River Basin, as well as protecting the environment,
aquatic life, and the ecological balance of the region.
</P>
<P>
The MRC is an inter-governmental organization of the four lower
Mekong Basin states: Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The Water Utilization Project aims to support the MRC in
developing an integrated and comprehensive Basin hydrologic
modeling package and a functional and integrated knowledge base on
water and related resources and use these tools to establish "
Rules," one of MRC's five major goals.
</P>
<P>
The rules, or obligations, of the member states will establish
guidelines for water utilization and ecological protection,
primarily the sensitive ecological systems including wetlands and
flooded forests.
</P>
<P>
"The Mekong Basin possesses a large portion of the region's
potential water sources. These water sources have the ability to
support economic growth through irrigation, hydropower, navigation,
water supply, and tourism," said Mei Xie, water resources
management specialist for the World Bank. "This grant will support
MRC and the member states to ensure that development of the water
resources is carried out in a sustainable manner that preservers
the environment."
</P>
<P>
The project will be implemented by the MRC who will work
through a Secretariat located in Phnom Penh and through the
National Mekong Committees, with national line agencies, local
communities, and other stakeholders such as the private sector and
non-governmental organizations to enhance the project's
sustainability.
</P>
<P>
While this project has a seven-year span, it should be seen as
a step on a long road, aiming to provide an opportunity to bring
governments together for meaningful and successful interactions on
improved and sustainable basin management, the World Bank said.

MEXICO CITY, February 14 (Xinhua)-- Belize's Prime Minister
Said Musa rejected Monday Guatemalan land claims, affirming they
lack historic and legal foundation.
</P>
<P>
"The best solution is for Guatemala to accept once and for all
Belize is a country recognized at world level as independent",
said Musa in an interview published Monday by Guatemalan daily "
Free Press".
</P>
<P>
Belize's Prime Minster expressed his rejection of Guatemala's
stance submitting this land dispute to international arbitration.

<P>
"We totally reject Guatemala's claim because it isn't based on
any historic or legal reason", said Musa.

Guatemala considers invalid a treaty it signed in 1859 with
Belize and Britain regarding border limits. The border between
Guatemala and Belize has been the scene of constant friction.

WASHINGTON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Monday that he was still optimistic about reaching
agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon
despite difficulties on all three tracks for peace.
</P>
<P>
"We're in a little tough patch ... but I think we're so close
on the substance that I am optimistic," Clinton told an interview
with CNN in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
"I think that there will have to be some forward progress here
in the next few weeks and I'll do whatever I can to facilitate it
in whatever way I can," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, in what was billed his first online news interview,
said he was always on the telephone talking about the Middle East
but did not say to whom he had talked.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the State Department said Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright will put her "shoulder to the wheel" for the
sake of peace process on both Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-
Palestinian tracks.
</P>
<P>
"This is a difficult process. It's always got its ups and downs.
Secretary Albright has been through numerous ups and downs in the
Middle East peace process in her tenure and she's determined to
keep her "shoulder to the wheel and help where we can," State
Department spokesman James Rubin told a briefing.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli talks, stalled last month, were facing even
tougher difficulties because of violence in south Lebanon over the
past week. And Israel and the Palestinians missed the target date
on Sunday for a framework agreement on final status negotiations.
The framework agreement should have laid the groundwork for
Israelis and Palestinians to reach a complete settlement for such
kind of issues as the status of Jerusalem, Jewish settlement in
Israel's occupied West Bank, and the Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Clinton attributed the difficulties to the fact that peace
talks were moving into the final phases. "We're down to the last
strokes. We're down to the hard decisions," he said.

<HEADLINE> China On U.N. peacekeeping Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Only by following the
guidance of the Charter of the United Nations and ensuring a solid
political and legal basis for peacekeeping missions could problems
facing peacekeeping operations be solved effectively, China
stressed here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the U.N. Special Committee on peacekeeping
Operations, Chinese Deputy Permanent Representative to the United
Nations, Shen Guofang, said such principles as respect for state
sovereignty and noninterference in member states' internal affairs
were the important basis for peacekeeping efforts.
</P>
<P>
Now more than ever, peacekeeping missions should highlight the
principle of resolving the conflict through peaceful means, and it
was impossible to stop a war by spreading it, Shen added.
</P>
<P>
An important prerequisite for success in peacekeeping
operations was the maintenance of the leading role of the United
Nations, and any unilateral action to take place of United Nations
peacekeeping operations, or any act by a certain organization to
replace, circumvent or supersede the United Nations, would not
only undermine the peacekeeping ability of the United Nations and
tarnish its credibility, but also intensify existing conflicts and
disputes, the Ambassador added.

<TEXT>

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States Monday
welcomed Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid's decision to
suspend General Wiranto's post of security minister as the former
military chief was implicated in East Timor atrocities.
</P>
<P>
"This action reflects President Wahid's government's intention
to seriously address charges against individuals alleged to be
responsible for human rights abuses in East Timor," State
Department spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the United States strongly supported what he called
Wahid's determination to assert civilian control over the military
in Indonesia, which occupied East Timor in 1975.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian military responded to Wahid's move by giving
him its backing, easing fears of a military coup.
</P>
<P>
Wahid's decision to suspend Wiranto as security minister came
on the eve of a visit by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Ancient Gold Platter Returns Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 14 (Xinhua) -- An ancient gold platter returned
to Italy's Sicily Monday after a long tug-of-war between Italy and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to Italian news agency Ansa, the case of the 24-karat
plate, embossed with an acorn motif and dating back to the 5th
century BC, has led the Italian government to ask the United
States to block the import of goods of dubious provenance.
</P>
<P>
Last October Italy asked the U.S. to impose strict controls on
all imports dating from the 5th century BC to the 5th century AD -
ten centuries stretching from Attic vases and Etruscan pottery to
Roman coins.
</P>
<P>
It has been estimated that some 50 million U.S. dollars of
Mediterranean antiquities change hands in the U.S. each year.
</P>
<P>
The platter was bought in 1991 by a U.S. hedge fund millionaire
and art collector, Michael Steinhardt. He paid 1.2 million U.S.
dollars to a dealer who had brought it back from Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, on Italy's request, it was seized by U.S. customs
officials on the grounds that its customs declaration contained
false information.
</P>
<P>
Steinhardt appealed the case all the way to the U.S. Supreme
Court, which last month upheld a ruling the plate should be
returned.
</P>
<P>
The plate, which was found near the town of Termini Imerese,
was handed back in a ceremony in New York four days ago.

<HEADLINE> Swiss President Urges Army to Help Switzerland's Opening-Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Swiss President and Defense
Minister Adolf Ogi have urged the Swiss army to help Switzerland
open up to the world in the course of the next decade.
</P>
<P>
"The army allowed Switzerland to cross the 20th century, a
century of blood and war. Now the army must help Switzerland open
up to the world," he told journalists in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Ogi said that Switzerland could no longer afford to be detached
from international affairs, and should build on the controversial
deployment of unarmed Swiss soldiers in Bosnia and Kosovo to
become involved in other missions as a matter of "peace,
solidarity and honor."
</P>
<P>
In a detailed presentation of his army reform program, Ogi
listed three major challenges to Swiss security, which include
conflicts and refugee crises such as the Balkans, as well as the
growing likelihood of natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that those challenges demanded active engagement
alongside the international community beyond the country's borders,
partly to help out in situations that would otherwise send
thousands of refugees heading for countries like Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister said Switzerland would also be unable to
defend itself from the growing threat represented by medium-range
missiles without seeking NATO's help. He hinted that other
developments outside Switzerland would force the country closer to
the Western military alliance, even if he ruled out membership as
"politically unacceptable" within the next decade or two.
</P>
<P>
Ogi also said plans were going ahead to set up a a new
international military think-tank, a center on the democratic
control of armed forces, in Geneva by 2003.

<HEADLINE> Peace Process in Serious Crisis: Irish FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Irish Foreign Minister Brian
Cowen Monday urged the re-establishment of the suspended Northern
Ireland executive "as quickly as possible."
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting with the Sinn Fein leadership, Cowen said
the peace process is in a "very serious situation."
</P>
<P>
"I am satisfied that the exchange of views we have had have
been productive in helping me make the case for the re-
establishment of the institutions absolutely as quickly as
possible and without delay," he told reporters outside Sinn Fein's
west Belfast headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Cowen is due to have talks with other party leaders, including
Ulster Unionist Party David Trimble, and a working dinner with
Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson before
reporting to the Irish government Friday.
</P>
<P>
The IRA had earlier come under renewed pressure to clarify its
stance on disarming as talks got under way to launch a fresh
review of Northern Ireland's peace process.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said confusion surrounding what was said to be General
John de Chastelaine's decommissioning body needed to be cleared up.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking after a meeting with Mandelson in Belfast as
efforts intensified to restart talks following the re-imposition
of direct rule at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Trimble called on Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams to clarify the
position following a statement by General de Chastelain Friday
that the IRA had stated the context in which it would "put its
weapons beyond use."
</P>
<P>
"They have to make it clear to us and the public as to the
extent of their commitment in terms of decommissioning," said
Trimble.
</P>
<P>
He said, "It appears they have said something with regard to it
to the general. I think we need that clearly out in the public
domain."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, Mandelson told Irish and British
parliamentarians the latest report on IRA arms decommissioning was
"very encouraging."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 10th anniversary meeting of the British Irish
Interparliamentary Body at Westminster, he said the IRA's attempt
to break the deadlock over disarmament had come too late to stop
the return of direct rule.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Ireland secretary confirmed he and the Irish
foreign minister would chair any forthcoming review of the
workings of the Good Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Tony Blair had a 20 minute
phone call with his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, Monday
afternoon about the attempts "to keep the peace process moving
forward."
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesperson for Blair, he said the second
report by General John de Chastelain did clearly "take us forward"
but further clarity was needed.
</P>
<P>
Ahern believes there has been a huge advance from the IRA on
the arms issue and that suspension was damaging the Good Friday
Agreement.

<HEADLINE> Germany Sets up Special Force for Internet Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Germany will maintain sharp
vigilance on Internet security after hackers attacked some of
world's most popular web sites, Interior Minister Otto Schily said
Monday here.
</P>
<P>
"The security in the information technology is a key question
for every economy," said Schily at a press briefing introducing
the new "task force" for Internet security.
</P>
<P>
"The federal government will take every measure to assure the
security in Internet," he said, "and the government and the
business must cooperate with each other to protect our economy
from this new menace."
</P>
<P>
Hackers attacked popular web sites such as Yahoo.com and
Amazon.com last week and caused losses up to 1.2 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The hackers applied the new software written by a German
programmer under the pseudonym "Mixter." The software, named"Tribe
Flood Network," is able to flood web sites with junk data,the
famous news weekly Der Spiegel reported.
</P>
<P>
"This kind of attacks is by no way technical games, but crimes
that must be prevented with every method," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The "task force" was set up jointly by the Interior Ministry,
the Federal Office For Security in Information Technology, and the
Federal Criminal Office (BKA) to cope with the challenge of
hackers.
</P>
<P>
It will give German business, especially the Internet Service
Providers (ISP) and Internet Contents Providers (ICP), technical
advices about how to protect their computers based on analysis and
evaluation of hackers' attacks, said Schily.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry will also contact with the U.S.
authorities to build up "common defense against Internet attacks,"
he said.

<P>
The Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) spacecraft
automatically fired its thrusters almost flawlessly at 10:33 a.m.
and then managed to settle itself into the orbit. About one minute
later the spacecraft sent signalled success to the earth.
</P>
<P>
NEAR was the first spacecraft that entered Eros' orbit.
</P>
<P>
The asteroid, named after the Greek god of love, is actually a
potato-shaped rock, 34 kilometers long and 13 kilometers wide. It
circles around the Sun like the earth.
</P>
<P>
Eros will spend the next whole year in the company of NEAR.
During the course, the spacecraft will drop to lower orbits
gradually. It will actually brush Eros' surface with a solar panel
late this year and take photos of the mark it leave.
</P>
<P>
The spacecraft was developed by scientists at the John Hopkins
University Applied Physics Laboratory under NASA contract.
Scientists from Cornell University and the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, California also are part of the NEAR team.
</P>
<P>
NEAR has five instruments, including a powerful camera, which
will map the surface of Eros in detail and send white-and-black
and color photos back to the earth.
</P>
<P>
Other instruments are to measure the asteroid's density
chemical composition and magnetic fields.
</P>
<P>
Although Eros poses no threat to the earth, scientists hope
that the exploration of it will help them get more knowledge of
asteroids and find measures of dealing with dangerous asteroids
that takes aim on our planet. Endiem

<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami is due to visit Germany in coming weeks in response to an
invitation from Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, German government
spokesman Uwe Karsten Heye said Monday in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Schroder invited Khatami for this state visit in a phone
conversation with the latter last Thursday, and the Iranian
president accepted the offer, said Heye.
</P>
<P>
The date for the trip is yet to be set, he said, adding that
the visit is not likely to begin before this week's Iranian
parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
Germany had invited Khatami previously, but the trip was
canceled last year after Iran sentenced a German businessman to
death for sexual relationship with an Iranian woman.
</P>
<P>
The tension between Germany and Iran passed over in this
January when the businessman was sent home. Then Iranian Deputy
Foreign Minister Morteza Sarmadi visited Germany earlier this
month.

MOSCOW, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Russia is joining in the
efforts to settle the situation on the Korean Peninsula, said
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov Monday after his visit to the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), Japan and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov told the press aboard the plane on his way home from the
Asia tour , "We are engaged in bilateral negotiations on this
issue with the Americans and we are also working in a four-party
format -- the DPRK, South Korea, China and the United States."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the situation on the Korean Peninsula "is
continuing to deteriorate, especially in light of the U.S. plans
to deploy a theater missile defense system in that region, which
will most certainly compound the situation," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that Russia and Japan join in the negotiating
process. "This will become more definite in the near future," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Washington had already showed interest in the
results of his Asia tour, which started on February 9.
</P>
<P>
During his trip to the DPRK, the first visit by a Russian
foreign minister to this country in the latest 10 years, he signed
with the DPRK side an agreement on neighborly ties and cooperation.

The benchmark index ended down 124.7 points, or 2.01 percent,
