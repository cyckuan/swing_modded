<HEADLINE> Greece Takes Delivery of U.S.-Made Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Greece on Sunday took delivery
of five U.S.-made ground-to-ground Atacams missiles, the first
consignment of a 19-billion drachma (about 633 million U.S.
dollars) order for 40 of such missiles.
</P>
<P>
The all-weather missiles, which have a range of 165 kilometers,
were delivered at the Sedes military airport in the northern Greek
city of Thessaloniki, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a delivery ceremony, Greece's Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos said that the government's goal was to build a
strong, modern army and an all-powerful deterrent and defense
force for the country's sovereignty, which would also support
Greece's peaceful and creative role in the wider geopolitical
region.
</P>
<P>
The missiles, which can be launched from mobile M270 units, are
reportedly designed to hit high-priority targets including
administrative and control installations and munitions depots.

<HEADLINE> Almighty Jones Defeated at World Cup Athletics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Marion Jones, the
U.S.sprint sensation, tasted her first loss in this season of
athletic events when she was beaten by German legend Heike
Drechsler in the long jump Sunday afternoon at the IAAF World Cup
in Athletics in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
She jumped 7.00m while Drechsler jumped 7.07m on the third and
final day of the quadrennial track and field showpiece. The
7.00m she achieved was by no means great for Jones compared with
her personal best of 7.31m set earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Braving drizzle and chilly wind, Drechsler, 33, proved her
class as the reigning European champion and snatched the gold
from the U.S.favorite.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Guan Yingnan won the first bronze for the Asian
women's team at the World Cup with a jump of 6.74m. The
20-year-old Asian champion added much needed 6 points to her
contingent, which was ranked last but one on the standings.

<HEADLINE> IMF Annual Report Highlights Financial Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Asian financial crisis
that appeared in July 1997 in Thailand and its subsequent global
reverberations, dominanted the IMF's work in 1997/98, and also
prompted a record level of IMF lending in the year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Annual Report 1998 released here Sunday by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), member countries drew some 25.6
billion U.S. dollars from the IMF's General Resources Account in
the credit tranches in the year of 1997/98, ended on April 30,
1998, nearly four times the level of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the IMF approved 9 new Stand-By Arrangements, with
total commitments of 27.3 billion Special Drawing Rights (SDR),
which is equivalent to some 27.3 billion dollars (As of April
30, SDR 1 is equal to 1.34666 dollars). Besides, there were 4 new
Extended Arrangements, with total commitments of SDR 2.8 billion,
which is about 3.77 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The largest Stand-By Arrangements were for South Korea,
Indonesia, and Thailand; the largest Extended Arrangement was for
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the IMF also approved 8 new ESAF (the Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Facility) Arrangements with commitments
totaling SDR 1.7 billion, or some 2.29 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
As of April 30, this year, 14 Stand-By Arrangements, 13
Extended Arrangements, and 33 ESAF Arrangements were in effect
with member countries. Net of repayments of previous drawings,
total IMF credit outstanding rose to a record 75.4 billion dollars
as of April 30 this year as compared with 55.3 billion dollars a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
In January 1998, the IMF Board of Governors adopted the
Executive Board's recommendation that total IMF quotas be
increased by 45 percent to SDR 212 billion from SDR 146 billion
under the 11th General Review of Quotas. The increase will take
effect after members having not less than 85 percent of total
quotas as of December 28, 1997, have consented to their quota
increase, the report noted.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Rejects Iran's Request for Apology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 13 (Xinhua)-- The Islamic Taliban militia
Sunday rejected Iran's request for tendering an apology and
handing over the killers of nine Iranian diplomats.
</P>
<P>
"We will never tender apology to Iran for the killing of its
diplomats as the Afghan Islamic Emirate is not involved in the
incident," Taliban's envoy in Pakistan, Saeedur Rahman Haqqani
told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Eleven Iranian diplomats and one reporter went missing when the
Taliban fighters took over the Afghan northern city of
Mazar-e-Sharif, headquarters of the pro-Iranian northern alliance,
early last month.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who have been denying Iran's allegations of
abducting these Iranians, announced Wednesday that it had
recovered the bodies of nine Iranian diplomats at the outskirts of
Mazar-e-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Haqqani described as "ridiculous" Iran's request from the
Taliban regime to apologize for the diplomats' murder. "The
shooting occurred without the knowledge of the local
commanders. It is highly condemnable that Iranian leaders are
repeating their demand for apology despite our leaders categorical
statement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Haqqani rejected any possibility of extraditing the killers of
the Iranian diplomats to Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We have our own judicial system and the murderers
will be tried under our own laws in lower and superior courts."
</P>
<P>
The Taliban supreme leader Muhammad Omar has formed a
ten-member commission to probe into the killing. The commission,
he said, has not yet succeeded tracing the killers.
</P>
<P>
In response to Iran's demand for the release of 45 Iranian
nationals detained by the Taliban, he said Iran should first ask
the anti-Taliban alliance to release Taliban's prisoners and then
send its high-level foreign ministry team for talks with militia
officials in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Iran has vowed to avenge the death of its diplomats and has
announced a second major military games on its border with
Afghanistan. The Taliban blamed the death of Iranian diplomats on
renegade Taliban soliders, warning Iran against military action on
Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Insists on Balanced Palestinian-Israeli Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Egypt Sunday insisted on
reaching a balanced Palestinian-Israeli agreement on further
redeployment as the U.S. savors progress on its attempts to break
the Mideast peace stalemate.
</P>
<P>
"Cairo is seeking to secure balanced agreement between the
Paletinian and Israeli sides in line with the Madrid and Oslo
framework," Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters
following talks between President Hosni Mubarak and U.S. Mideast
peace envoy Dennis Ross in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak received a report from Ross, who arrived in Egypt
earlier in the day on a whistle-stop visit, on his negotiations
with Palestinian and Israeli officials in the past four days to
close the gap.
</P>
<P>
Ross said the U.S. efforts being exerted have realized progress
on some topics and that some difficulties still remain regarding a
number of others which need more efforts to be overcome.
</P>
<P>
"But the gap still exists between the two sides," regretted Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Egypt's stance, he reiterated the importance of
achieving balance in any agreement between the Palestinians and
Israelis and preserving the interests of both sides.
</P>
<P>
"No one could possibly imagine that a bad agreement would result
in progress. But all in all, it is an issue up to the Palestinian
leadership to decide," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian foreign minister categorically denied that Cairo
is applying pressure on the Palestinians not to accept a
watered-down version of the U.S. plan.
</P>
<P>
Israel has offered a compromise to the U.S. plan for an Israeli
troop pullback from another 13 percent of the West Bank in
exchange for Palestinian steps on security, saying that 3 percent
should be turned into nature reserves. The Palestinians are yet
to accept it.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt is not pressuring the Palestinian Authority to accept
certain ideas. It is definitely not a role we are playing," Moussa
said.
</P>
<P>
Ross also denied that his current trip is trying to pressure
Egypt and soften its stance.
</P>
<P>
Ross returned to Jerusalem immediately after his talks in Cairo
to resume negotiations with the Palestinian and Israeli sides.
</P>
<P>
Since his arrival in the region last Wednesday, Ross met with
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat Wednesday
and Saturday, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
Thursday and Friday in a bid to break an 18-month peacemaking
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace with Israel, has
been mediating in the peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Official Calls for Luring Back Capitals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The governor of the
Saudi Monetary Fund (Saudi central bank), Hamad Alsayyari, Sunday
called for more incentives to lure back the huge amount of
capitals Saudi Arabians had invested abroad.
</P>
<P>
Alsayyari said that "Saudi citizens have invested huge sums in
the international capital markets and there is a need to attract
these investments back into Saudi Arabia and offer them
incentives to stay in the local markets," according to a report
by the Kuwait News Agency. But he did not gave a figure of
capitals invested abroad by the Saudis.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the third seminar on investment products and
services in Saudi Arabia, Alsayyari stressed the importance of
coming up with methods to strengthen and broaden the Saudi
Arabian financial markets and encourage the private sector to
play a greater role.
</P>
<P>
He said there is a need to consider the development of
a more "active and deeper secondary market for government
securities."
</P>
<P>
Alsayyari said that Saudi banks registered big leaps in
their investment programs over the past 10 years, with most
of them offering a wide range of investment products and
services including 100 investment funds with combined assets
reaching 5.8 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Agreement Between Two Somali Factions May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 13 (Xinhua)-- The Islamic Fundamentalist
Group of Al-Itihad Al-Islam Sunday warned against a possible
collapse of its agreement with the Somali National Front (SNF)
faction signed early last month.
</P>
<P>
Al-Itihad Al-Islam has issued a stern warning to the SNP
faction that the agreement signed in El-Adde Village of Gedo
Region is on tha verge of a total failure unless statesmen,
traditional leaders and elders get up for rescuing the agreement
which has brought about a tangible stability to the region.
</P>
<P>
The strongly worded warning came after Colonel Sheikh Adan
Elmi Jama from the Al-Itihad Al-Islam was shot dead in the Gedo
regional capital of Garbaharrey Town three days ago. Another
official from Al-Itihad was also wounded during the attack.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters via VHF radio here in Mogadishu Sunday,
Hussein Guled Aden, the chief delegate of Al-Itihad Al-Islam for
the implementation of the El-Adde Village Agreement, said four of
his delegation members were also rounded up and taken away to the
border town of Dolow-Somalia.
</P>
<P>
According to Aden, the killing of Colonel Jama and the
subsequent arrests made by what he called elements from the SNF
faction has been a deliberate plot set up for undermining the
agreement between Al-Itihad and the main SNF Marehan faction.
</P>
<P>
Aden characterized the new moves as unfortunate and a setback
to the overall agreement which will threaten the security of the
region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Aden who spoke to reporters in Dhamaso Village, 120 km south
of the border town of Bulo Hawo, said his delegation including
the deceased, wounded and the others arrested were in an official
invitation to visit Garbaharrey for the implementation of the
El-Adde Agreement and its modalities. However, he said the rest
of his delegation and himself had fled the town of Garbaharrey
immediately after the killing and the arrests were made.
</P>
<P>
Aden has called the SNF statesmen and elders to be careful of
what is going on and honor the agreement they have signed with
Al-Itihad Al-Islam. He has also called the elders of SNF Marehan
faction to free those arrested soon and give an understandable
explanation to the matter concerned so as to save their agreement
with Al-itihad.
</P>
<P>
The agreement between Al-Itihad and the Marehan SNF faction
has brought about the opening of the 180-km road between the
important town of Sulo Hawo and El-Adde Village. The agreement
has also facilitated the free movement of business in the region
even though many other roads still remain closed for landmines
which are yet to be exhumed.

"I voiced Iran's serious concern on Turkey's military
cooperation with Israel, as other regional countries did,"
Kharrazi said at a joint press conference with Cem who arrived
here on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran and Turkey have different views over
the cooperation with Israel and he has informed Cem of
Iran's stance over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Cem replied that Ankara's cooperation with Tel Aviv is not
against any third country.
</P>
<P>
"I heard some saying against Turkey during the recent
tripartite meeting among Iran, Greece and Armenia" held in
Tehran last week, the Turkish foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi immediately refuted the saying and stated that
foreign ministers of Iran, Greece and Armenia did not talk
about Turkey, but economic cooperation among the three
countries.
</P>
<P>
But the Iranian minister noted that Iran and Turkey have
some common views and stances on regional and international
issues.
</P>
<P>
He said he and Cem discussed in details the issues of
Afghanistan, northern Iraq, Cyprus, border security and
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that the two sides reached the consensus to
hold regular meetings twice a year in order to exchange
views over regional and international issues.
</P>
<P>
Both the two foreign ministers agreed that relations between
Tehran and Ankara have been improved during the past six
months and the two countries would make efforts to reduce
their differences.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Turkey exchanged their ambassadors in March to end
a year-long diplomatic row caused by a pro-Islamic speech of
former Iranian ambassador to Ankara Mohammad Reza Baqeri.
</P>
<P>
In February last year, Baqeri was asked to leave Turkey
for insulting the Turkish secular government. In retaliation,
Iran also asked Turkey to recall its ambassador to Tehran
Osman Koruturk.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reached agreement to resume their dispatch of
ambassadors in September last year, after the moderate
government of President Mohammad Khatami came to power.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM Says Israel Wants No Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri Sunday blasted Israeli policy, saying that the Jewish State
does not want peace but to control Arab World, the state-run
National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said in an interview with the Egyptian magazine Rouz
Al-yussef that Israel, which refused to withdraw its troops from
its occupied south Lebanon and Syrian Golan Heights, should be
blamed for the deadlock of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli government has not yet taken a strategical policy
on how to live in the region," he asserted.
</P>
<P>
"In another words, which kind of state does Israel want to be,
to control the Arab countries or live peacefully among them?" he
asked.
</P>
<P>
He said any ideas to control the Arab world will never
succeed. But if Israel wants to choose the latter, it must step
onto the peace road, he added.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured Syrian Golan Heights in the 1967 Middle
East war and occupied a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in
south Lebanon in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between Israel and each of Syria and Lebanon
broke off when the hardline Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu came to power in June, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Hariri reiterated that if Israel withdraws from its occupied
south Lebanon and Golan Heights, peace agreement can be signed
within three months.
</P>
<P>
But he said Israel in fact does not want peace and responded by
illogical demands.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, Israeli cabinet endorsed the 20-year-old
United Nations Resolution 425 but linked the implementation of
it with the Beirut government security guarantee for its north.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its ally Syria flatly rejected the offer, asking
the Jewish state to leave the country without any preconditions
as stipulated in the resolution.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Urges Sanctions on Angola's UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GRAND BAIE, Mauritius, September 13 (Xinhua) -- South African
President Nelson Mandela Sunday urged the implementation of
United Nations Security Council sanctions on Angolan opposition
movement National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Mandela expressed his confidence in the U.N. resolution in
settling the Angolan crisis in his speech on Sunday afternoon at
the opening ceremony of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) summit here in the north of Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions on the UNITA include its officials' foreign
trips, in a bid to oblige the former rebel movement to comply
fully with the Lusaka peace protocol signed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
On the crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),
Mandela reiterated Saturday that there should be coordination of
interventions based on the decisions taken at the summits at
Victoria Falls of Zimbabwe and Pretoria of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
It is critical that all the initiatives being taken should be
harmonized, said the South African president.
</P>
<P>
"We are encouraged by the progress in the Victoria Falls
initiative toward securing peace in the Democratic Republic of
Congo, and in staving off a conflict which threatened to involve
the whole region," attributing the progress made to the quality
of African leadership.
</P>
<P>
According to Mandela who is also the current Chairman of the
SADC summit, the challenge now is to develop and implement the
agreements so that the people of the DRC can determine their own
destiny and embark on reconstruction as a united, democratic,
stable and prosperous nation.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the peace initiatives so far taken by African
leaders will be vital to the inter-dependence and stability of
all the countries in southern Africa and the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also urged SADC member states to work together with
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to "create the mechanisms
which will ensure progress toward processes which will ultimately
result in genuinely democratic elections."
</P>
<P>
The armed clashes in the DRC, the third largest African country,
has drawn nearly half of the 14 SADC members, with Zimbabwe,
Namibia and Angola sending in troops to prop up President Laurent
Kabila's government which is accused by the rebels of corruption
and nepotism.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Mandela also expressed his concern over
the political situation in Lesotho. However, he added with a
belief that however bitter the debate may be, a solution will be
found.
</P>
<P>
There had been protests in Lesotho against the ruling party
for its alleged rigging in the last elections.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Calls for Debt Relief for SADC Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GRAND BAIE, Mauritius, September 13 (Xinhua) -- South African
President Nelson Mandela Sunday called for debt relief to ensure
the sustainable development for southern African countries.
</P>
<P>
The pace of socio-economic change in the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) countries continues to be impeded by
the cost of servicing debt, Mandela said in his speech at the
opening of the SADC summit here in the north of the Indian Ocean
island country.
</P>
<P>
President Mandela, who is also the current Chairman of the
SADC, said he was concerned that in most SADC countries debt
repayments have taken up a "significant proportion" of the gross
domestic products and use up resources which should have been for
funding productive investment, building of houses, education and
the extension of health care.
</P>
<P>
"Our ability to continue lowering inflation and reducing
fiscal deficits is therefore dependent on the willingness of the
creditor countries and institutions to work with us to devise
realistic debt cancellation schedules," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also urged African countries to take advantage of the
opportunities of integration in the global market by initiating a
viable and sustainable regional development plan.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the South African president voiced the determination
of southern African countries to make the region a leading
destination for foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
"We remain committed to the combination of sound economic
policies, good governance and far-reaching program of
reconstruction and development," pledged the 80-year-old
anti-apartheid hero.
</P>
<P>
The two day summit of the SADC heads of state and government
will also discuss food security, the impact of Asian and Russian
financial crises on the region as well as other issues concerning
regional economic integration.

<P>
AMMAN, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian Embassy in
Israel will arrange the family members of the 14 Jordanians
jailed in Israeli prisons to go to the Jewish state and visit
them, Minister of Information Nasir Judeh said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Judeh said that the
embassy decided to make such arrangements after Israel gave the
approval recently.
</P>
<P>
Only two relatives of each Jordanian prisoner will be allowed
to go to Israel, he added.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Jordanian Embassy in Israel has also been seeking
ways to improve the imprisonment conditions of the 14 Jordanian
jail birds, Judeh said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Jordanian government is making all possible
efforts to make Israel release them as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
No official record has been released so far about what crimes
the 14 Jordanians committed in the Jewish state as well as what
sentences they received.

Jordan, Israel's close ally in the Arab world, signed a peace
treaty with the Jewish state in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Cracks down on Underground Opposition Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian security services
have detained 20 members of a banned political party on charge of
membership in illegal organizations, Minister of Information Nasir
Judeh said here Sunday at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The detainees were from the Al Tahrir Party (the liberation
party), which has been officially banned for years, said Judeh.
</P>
<P>
Three of them have been released and the rest will be
transferred to the State Security Court to receive sentences, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The arrests were made after years of investigation, said
Judeh, while refusing to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The Al Tahrir Party is known as the only underground opposition
party that has been officially mentioned by the Jordanian
government so far.
</P>
<P>
This party adheres to Islamic ideology and strives to have the
Islamic law based on the Koran in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Jordan allows the existence of opposition parties, but they
have to be registered and are not allowed to hold underground
activities.

<HEADLINE> Libya to Disband Ministry of Arab Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Libya will disband its Ministry
of Arab Unity in the coming few weeks, the Middle East News Agency
(MENA) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
MENA quoted informed Libyan sources as saying Sunday that
Secretariat of the General People's Committee for Libyan Unity,
the official Libyan authority assigned with Libyan-Arab affairs
and relations, will be canceled at the upcoming session of the
parliament within weeks.
</P>
<P>
Gomaa Kazzani, secretary of the committee, will attend the Arab
League Council meetings of foreign ministers scheduled in Cairo
Wednesday as his final job. The Arab meeting is expected to
discuss the latest developments in the West-Libya crisis over the
Lockerbie issue.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the decision was made in line with Libya's
increasing assertion of its African affiliation.
</P>
<P>
Local observers believe that Libya is taking the step to
protest Arab failure to have the seven-year-old United Nations
sanctions against the Afro-Arab country lifted.
</P>
<P>
In a recent TV interview, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi rapped
Arab countries for not showing enough support to Libya, while
praising the Organization of African Unity (OAU) for backing its
demand for lifting the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed air, arms and diplomatic embargo on the
country in 1992 after Libya failed to hand over two Libyans
suspected of blowing up an American flight over Lockerbie,
Scotland in 1988. The bombing killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
The OAU, in its summit meeting in June, adopted a resolution to
defy the sanctions starting from this month if the United States
and Britain fail to make compromise.

<HEADLINE> Primakov: New Government Members to be Submitted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 13 (Xinhua) -- New Russian Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov stated on Sunday that he will submit proposals
for the new government by the end of next week.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the NTV Itogi television Primakov said
that he would meet all party factions to discuss the government
formation and submit his proposals to the president by the end of
next week.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the new government must be reorganized by
professionals. Some other Communists could join the Cabinet, but
only if they were professionals, Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
The government must do everything to continue the reforms, he
said. "It is necessary to correct some mistakes made in the past".
</P>
<P>
Primakov noted "It should be a socially-oriented economy. We
must remember that even during the transition to a free market, to
an effective economy everything must serve the people."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister emphasized that the government must lean on
the parliament for support, but it cannot be an adjunct of the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the newly-appointed Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
and new Chairman of the Central Bank Viktor Gerashchenko, Primakov
said that both men are high-grade professionals, experts. They
were figures chosen right; Gerashchenko is ready to work together
with the government.
</P>
<P>
He also called the appointment of Yuri Maslyukov to the post of
the first deputy Prime Minister absolutely optimal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Primakov declared that he does not aspire to
presidency in 2000.
</P>
<P>
On the foreign investments the premier said that the attraction
of foreign investments in Russian industries will be a priority of
the government.
</P>
<P>
"A consistent policy of reforms will be guaranteed", Primakov
said, "We are part of the world economy."

<HEADLINE> Five Years Later, Oslo Agreement in Coma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerusalem, September 13 (Xinhua) -- When the historic Oslo
Accords were signed in Washington today five years ago, the
Palestinians were promised land and the Israelis peace. Five
years later, the rosy picture remains a dream.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo, most of the West Bank should have been handed
over to the Palestinians two years ago. Today, however, the
Palestinians are still struggling to get a small portion of the
land.
</P>
<P>
On the part of Israel, it is still dissatisfied with what the
Palestinians have done on fighting terrorism, declaring that more
Israelis have been killed in terror attacks in the five years
since Oslo than in the 15 preceding years.
</P>
<P>
The fifth anniversary of the Oslo Accords has been marked by
clashes between the Palestinians and Israeli soldiers, the
Israeli closure of the West Bank and Gaza, and massive peace
demonstrations in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians had been expected to sign an
agreement over the Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank in
Washington Sunday, but nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross is still shuttling
between the two sides to bridge their gaps over the second stage
of Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank and the prospect of an
agreement remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
The Oslo peace process went quite smoothly in its first two
years. Following a series of deadly suicide bombings sponsored by
Hamas against Israel in early 1996 and the current Likud
government came to power in the middle of that year, the peace
process began to falter.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had repeatedly
attacked the Oslo Accords for being incomplete and failing to
address Israeli security concerns, has replaced the "land for
peace" principle by "peace with security" since he took office in
1996.
</P>
<P>
In line with this policy, Israel began to build Jewish
settlements, abolishing the former Labor government's policy of
freezing their establishment, and delayed the redeployment in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel also tightened the control over Jerusalem, on which
both Israel and the Palestinians claim sovereignty, by intensifying
settlement activity and demolishing Palestinian houses. In June
this year, it approved a controversial plan to expand the city
far beyond its current borders, annexing some areas in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
All these measures, together with sporadic Hamas terror
attacks, have derailed the Oslo process and led to the current
stalemate in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Oslo Accords have designed a confidence-building mechanism by
leaving most of the toughest issues to final status talks, but
the depth of recrimination between the two sides has shaken the
foundation of the peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
Political observers said that the Oslo Accords are in a coma,
if not dead, and the lack of mutual confidence is the root.
</P>
<P>
Five years of peace process, no matter how tortuous it goes,
have changed the attitudes of Israeli and Palestinian
people. Analysts said that more and more Israelis are accepting
the reality of a future Palestinian state and most Palestinians
believe there is no alternative to Oslo Accords.
</P>
<P>
Since the deadline of Oslo Accords is approaching, analysts
noted that the two sides have to rebuild their mutual trust as
soon as possible and carry out all signed agreements seriously
and swiftly. That's the only path to peace the Oslo Accords
envisioned five years ago, they said.

<HEADLINE> Kohl's Allies Win Absolute Majority in German </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 13 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
main political allies, the Christian Social Union (CDU) party,
succeeded in defending its absolute majority in the local
parliamentary election in the southern German state of Bavaria on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a local vote widely seen as a sentiment test for the German
national elections just two weeks away, the CSU, the Bavarian
sister party of Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), managed
to win about 53 percent of the vote, almost unchanged from its
showing of 52.8 percent in the 1994 local election, preliminary
computer projections showed.
</P>
<P>
Germany's main opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD), which
is leading Kohl in popularity polls nationwide, scored only a
little more than 29 percent, down from its 1994 showing of 30
percent, thus failing to orchestrate a major setback for Kohl as
it expected earlier.
</P>
<P>
"It is a major setback for the SPD and its federal chancellor
candidate Gerhard Schroeder," declared CSU chief election
candidate and Bavarian state premier, Edmund Stoiber.
</P>
<P>
CSU politicians also described the Bavarian vote as the first
major victory for Kohl's conservative parties in German local
votes since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts, however, warned against exaggeration of the
Bavarian impact on the national elections, noting that the
politics in Bavaria had always been a special case.
</P>
<P>
Being the largest one of Germany's 16 federal states, Bavaria
has been a traditional conservative stronghold which has been
governed uninterruptedly by the CSU since 1966.
</P>
<P>
It is also the most prosperous German state with the lowest
unemployment rate, lowest crime rate and is the most attractive
place within Germany for foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The odds, however, has turned against Kohl nationwide at a time
when Germany is suffering badly from near-record high unemployment
as well as a reform standstill which is said to have turned away
many foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, riding on a voters' sentiment for political change
in Bonn after 16 years of rule by Kohl's centre-right coalition,
is currently leading Kohl by three to six percent in opinion polls
though the gap has been narrowed significantly when compared with
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
In response to the Bavarian poll, Schroeder said he was still
confident about a SPD victory in the national elections.
</P>
<P>
"Helmut Kohl did not stand for election today. The results will
be different in 14 days," Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the CSU victory in Bavaria came at least as a
much-needed psychological boost for Kohl who is fighting a uphill
battle to win an unprecedented fifth term.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his chancellor office in Bonn, Kohl described the
Bavarian vote as an "important signal" which showed that the
national elections had not yet been decided.
</P>
<P>
"We have a good chance to reach our election goal," Kohl said.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Reduce Taxes for Lower Inflation in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Greece might reduce taxes in
1999 in order to help lower inflation, which was important for the
country to join the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in
2001, a government official said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Greek Economy and Finance Minister
Yannos Papantoniou said that the government was examing the
possibility of lowering taxes, and if there was room for a
reduction in 1999, this would happen so that inflation might fall
and Greece might easily enter EMU.
</P>
<P>
Greece has lost the chance to join EMU in 1999, but the country
has set January 1, 2001, as the latest entry date into the single
currency.
</P>
<P>
Greece's consumer price inflation reduced from 5.1 percent in
July to 5.0 percent in August. Combined with other criteria, the
inflation rate needs to drop to roughly 2.4 percent before Athens
can join EMU.

<HEADLINE> Greece Condemns Killing of Albanian Opposition Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Greece Monday strongly
condemned the killing of a main Albanian opposition leader, saying
those responsible should be arrested and brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
Azem Hajdari, 35, Democratic Party deputy leader, was fatally
wounded and died Saturday in front of Democratic Party
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Another opposition leader, Sali Berisha, blamed Prime Minister
Fatos Nano for the killing and warned him to resign within 24
hours or face "catastrophic consequences", according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Opposition supporters shot and bombed Nano's office and guards
inside after attending Hajdari's funeral in Tirana on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Foreign Ministry spokesman Theodoros Theodorou said
his country was deeply concerned about the political situation in
neighboring Albania.
</P>
<P>
Fearing that the protests and instability would lead to more
serious consequences, Theodorou urged Albania's politicians to
show restraint and prudence.
</P>
<P>
Theodorou said Greece had helped Albania's economic recovery
and growth and participated in international efforts to stabilize
the country, so it was justifiable for Greece to watch closely
over the Greek community living in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said Monday that
Greece was prepared to help any possible influx of refugees from
Albania.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani PM Asks to Sign CTBT if Sanctions Lifted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif Monday demanded the Parliament the power to sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) if the international economic
sanctions imposed against Pakistan were lifted.
</P>
<P>
A resolution drafted by the government and yet to be placed
before the Parliament purports to "authorize the government to
take a decision on CTBT in the best national interest while fully
safeguarding the nuclear capability of the country and after the
removal of the sanctions and other coercive measures."
</P>
<P>
The two houses of the 304-member Parliament are currently in a
joint session to initiate a rare debate on whether or not to sign
the CTBT.
</P>
<P>
The government of Sharif decided to take the controversial CTBT
issue to the Parliament amid serious economic pressures due to the
sanctions imposed by some western nations after Pakistan's nuclear
tests at the end of May.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jammat-e-Islami Chief Qazi Hussain Ahmed, addressing
a large public gathering before the Parliament House Monday
evening, demanded the government hold a referendum on whether or
not Pakistan should sign the CTBT.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution calls upon the international community to
remove sanctions and take urgent steps for a just settlement of
the Jammu and Kashmir dispute between Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that passage of the draft resolution is
important before Sharif meets U.S. President Bill Clinton in New
York this month where he is expected to bargain with Clinton for
reviving Pakistan's staggering economy.
</P>
<P>
This could only be possible if the Parliament grants him the
power proposed in the resolution, namely to sign the CTBT if the
economic sanctions are lifted.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Hosts Thailand's national
soccer squad remained in the Asian Games draw despite being
suspended from international events, officials said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Thai team received the suspension for a farcical match
against Indonesia which sparked calls for a crackdown on soccer
corruption.
</P>
<P>
But officials, who announced the draw for the Asian Games,
confirmed only the pull-out of Indonesia's soccer team along with
Malaysia and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Bhichai Rattakul said Thailand had
learned the lesson from the shameful Tiger Cup match in Vietnam
in August.
</P>
<P>
"We got a painful lesson and we learnt a hard way," he
said."the Thai team was young and should move on from past
failures."
</P>
<P>
Bhichai said that he had received a very good response from
officials of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC).
</P>
<P>
The AFC suspended both teams Friday over a match that they
played to lose and called for a task force to tackle resurgent
soccer corruption.
</P>
<P>
"It is a good time for Thailand to erase the shameful match in
Vietnam," he added.
</P>
<P>
Bhichai said 27 countries and regions would send football
teams to the Asian Games, the biggest entry in the history of the
tournament.

<TEXT>
<P>
Vienna, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) announced Monday that its basket of
reference crudes rose from 11.99 U.S. dollars per barrel to 12.27
dollars in August.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, because supply in the international oil
market exceeded demand, OPEC's crude prices kept falling. To cope
with the situation, OPEC has cut its daily ceiling production
twice, a total reduction of 2.6 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, OPEC's oil prices remained low. The average price
in August was 11.89 dollars per barrel, compared to last year's
price of 18.68 dollars and OPEC's reference price 21 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Actual daily production has reportedly since dropped and
experts are forecasting a rise in oil prices with the onset of
winter.

<HEADLINE> World Food Program to Provide Foodgrain to Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
will provide 355,000 tons of foodgrain for Bangladesh's
flood-stricken people during a penury following the calamity, the
Associated Press of Bangladesh (APB) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The aid package is in addition to the United Nations food
agency's pre-flood allocation of 542,000 tons of foods which are
being utilized for various projects.
</P>
<P>
"We have also proposed to increase the supply of food as the
'need is very high'" due to the over-two-month-long flood that
affected about 30 million people seriously, WFP's country
representative Werner Kiene said while announcing the assistance
at a press briefing Monday.
</P>
<P>
The UN agency does not foresee a famine in the aftermath of
this devastating flood, if all mechanisms work well in the
post-flood program, he said, adding "there is minimum possibility
of food crisis."
</P>
<P>
He mentioned that the U.S. government has announced a food aid
of 400,000 tons while other countries and donor agencies have
pledged around 110,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Bangladeshi government is also importing 200,000
tons of food, apart from the import by private sector, that would
help cope with the present situation, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the WFP representative said they would monitor the
distribution of food at district and township levels through their
teams to make sure that foods are not mis-used.

DHAKA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Foreign Secretary
Mostafizur Rahman will leave here Monday night for Washington to
seek more food aid and other relief materials for the millions of
flood victims in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We require an additional 300,000 tons of foodgrains to meet
our needs," Rahman told reporters on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Besides foodgrains, he said he would also require the United
States to provide ready-to-eat food and medicines for the nearly
30 million flood-hit people across the country. The United States
has so far committed 400,000 tons of food grains to flood-stricken
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit, the foreign secretary would have
talks with U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State on South Asian
Affairs Karl Inderfurth and other government officials.
</P>
<P>
Rahman said that he would discuss with the U.S. side the
possibility of a 30-percent increase of import of Bangladeshi
garments in the American market and the writing off of Dhaka's
debt of 700 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He would also discuss with U.S. Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson about U.S. investment in the South Asian nation's
energy sector in which some American companies have been actively
involved.
</P>
<P>
The over-two-month-long flood has left millions of people
homeless and over 800 dead in Bangladesh, and there are fears of a
possible famine after the flood.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Serie A Likely to Shrink </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Teams for Italy's Serie A could
be reduced from 18 to 16 for the sake of top clubs and national
sides, soccer federation chief Luciano Nizzola said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Serie A featured 16 teams from 1934-43 and from 1967-88,
and has hovered between 16 and 18 teams.
</P>
<P>
"I think that in future it would be desirable to return to 16
teams," Nizzola said. "Since it is becoming increasingly
difficult to accommodate the demands of both the clubs and the
various national sides."
</P>
<P>
About 150 foreign players played with Serie A clubs, causing
frequent problems during the qualifying rounds of major
international tournaments such as the World Cup, the European
Championships and the Copa America.
</P>
<P>
Inter and AC Milan are regularly involved in arm-twisting with
Brazilian soccer officials over releasing the likes of Ronaldo
and Leonardo.
</P>
<P>
Clubs also know that the likely emergence of a midweek
European Super League, either under the auspices of UEFA or a
TV-led private consortium, will force them to cut back their
national league commitments.
</P>
<P>
Taking sides with the European Football Union, Nizzola said:
"I think that the Super League should be part of UEFA, which is
an international body. It's hard to think of a championship
managed by private concerns."

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of workers and
students Monday held rally in Medan, capital of Indonesia's North
Sumatra province, demanding the lowering of commodity prices,
especially that of automotive spare parts and food.
</P>
<P>
Public transportation in the city was totally paralyzed as
about 6,000 vehicles of the city's public transport fleet lay
idle, Antara News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Some of the rallying transport workers threw stones at cars
passing by and at buildings located near the venue of their rally.
They also stopped public buses coming in from outside Medan and
persuaded the newly-arrived drivers to join their demonstration in
front of the governor's office.
</P>
<P>
An estimated group of several hundreds of people stormed and
looted Yuki Simpang Raya Place, one of the city's new and
prestigious shopping centers, the report said.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate report of any casualty in the attack on
the shopping center but a few shopkeepers needed medical help for
light injuries. Security officers blocked a number of streets
around the shopping center.
</P>
<P>
Until noon Monday, the atmosphere in Medan was still tense, the
agency said, adding that most shops, banks and offices closed
virtually paralyzing all business activities for the rest of the
day.
</P>
<P>
Last week, students in Jakarta, Surabaya, Semarang, Bandung and
other cities held rallies to protest against the spiraling prices
of basic commodities. They urged President B.J. Habibie to take
concrete measures to solve the country's economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few weeks, rice prices have sharply increased to
about 5,000 rupiah (0.45 U.S. dollar) per kilogram, compared to
the Indonesian government's targeted price of 2,000 rupiah per
kilogram.

<HEADLINE> Appropriate Measures by Responsible Gov't, Tung Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong government must
adopt appropriate measures to maintain the integrity and
orderliness of the currency, stock and futures markets to protect
Hong Kong's economy and members of the public from unnecessary
losses, Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This is what is expected of a responsible government," Tung
said.
</P>
<P>
To fend off market manipulators, the government decided to
intervene in the stock and futures markets last month, followed by
seven technical measures to strengthen the currency board system
and a 30-point package to tighten market control.
</P>
<P>
"From reports in the local media, the decision and measures
taken by the government have received the support of most Hong
Kong people," the chief executive said.
</P>
<P>
Tung is meeting Legislative Council members and representatives
from political parties in groups Monday and Tuesday to listen to
their views on future policy directions as Tung's second Policy
Address is to be delivered early October.
</P>
<P>
He met with representatives from the Democratic Party, Liberal
Party and the Breakfast Independent Group this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
At the meetings with party representatives, the chief executive
reaffirmed the government's commitment to maintaining Hong Kong's
status as an international financial center.
</P>
<P>
"We have used as reference what is being done in major
financial markets such as those in the U.S., UK and Australia in
drawing up the measures (to strengthen the operation and
monitoring system of Hong Kong financial market)."
</P>
<P>
"We believe these measures will effectively deter market

not affect those investors engaging in normal transactions. In
fact, the interests of these investors will be even better
protected."
</P>
<P>
As for some of the measures that require the enactment of
legislation, relevant bills will be introduced into the
Legislative Council very soon, Tung said, and expressed the hope
that the bills would win the support of the council.
</P>
<P>
Tung said: "When the financial markets are manipulated, the
free market system cannot function normally and investors will
stop coming. This is exactly the unusual situation our markets
have been facing in recent months."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we must adopt effective measures to quickly restore
order in the free markets to ensure their proper functioning in a
bid to attract investors," Tung said.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 14 (Xinhua) --The three major Cambodian
political parties agreed Monday to meet with King Norodom Sihanouk
in Siem Reap, marking the beginning of a possible resolution to
the political crisis.
</P>
<P>
They reached agreement on three main points:
</P>
<P>
-- not to cause or provoke any public demonstrations;
</P>
<P>
-- to hold a summit in Siem Reap under the chairmanship of the
King and without any pre-conditions;
</P>
<P>
-- the newly elected National Assembly should be convened as
scheduled on September 24.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after Thai Deputy Foreign Minister
Sukhumbhand Paribatra separately met with the leaders of the three
main parties.
</P>
<P>
"I thought the three parties' positions were much closer than
I had realized," Paribatra said after meeting with Chea Sim, the
President of Cambodian People's Party (CPP), Prince Ranariddh,
President of Funcinpec Party, and Sam Rainsy, President of the Sam
Rainsy Party (SRP).
</P>
<P>
Chea Sim was already prepared to participate in the meeting in
Siem Reap, according to the spokesman of his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Prince Ranariddh said he and Sam Rainsy would meet the king on
September 16 and 17. "We, Sam Rainsy and I, agreed to attend any
summit meeting with the King in Siem Reap," he said.
</P>
<P>
Paribatra began his two-day visit to Cambodia on Sunday. He
met with King Sihanouk in Siem Reap on Sunday and conveyed a
letter from Thai Premier Chuan Leekpai which expressed Thai
concerns over the recent unrest and support for the King in
resolving the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Anti-government demonstrations continued Monday in Phnom Penh,
but on a much smaller scale compared to recent days. Military
police detained at least five protesters and sporadic gunfire
could be heard.

<P>
LONDON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Northern Ireland assembly
held its first meeting in Belfast on Monday with its 108 members
attending to implement the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Politicians from the rival sectarian sides took their seats at
Parliament Buildings, Stormont, in east Belfast, debated
procedural matters, and would later discuss the repercussions of
the Omagh bombing that killed 29 people a month ago.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the representatives from all parties is seen as
a critical step on the road to peace.
</P>
<P>
The assembly was established in late June in accordance with
the peace agreement and went into Summer recession soon after
electing the first minister David Trimble and his deputy on July
1. London does not hand over compete control to the Assembly until
early 1999.
</P>
<P>
Deputy First Minister Seamus Mallon said at the assembly: "The
new politics beckons, this is a time for responsibility and
commitment."
</P>
<P>
"None of us are angels and we will not create heaven on earth
but at least we can end what has been for many of our people in
recent years a hell on Earth," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams, who is also elected into the
assembly, called for every member of the Assembly to dedicate
themselves to this "common endeavor".
</P>
<P>
"The Good Friday Agreement, and the executive and other
institutions which it establishes, present all of us with an
opportunity to take charge of our own destiny.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that if we apply ourselves boldly with
imagination and honesty and embrace the need for fundamental
change we can chart a course for a new future for all the people
of this island," he said.

<HEADLINE> HK Makes Good Progress in Tackling Year 2000 Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Over 99 percent of Hong
Kong government's critical computer and embedded systems would be
year 2000 compliant by the first half next year, a government
paper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a paper tabled at the Legislative Council Information
Technology and Broadcasting Panel meeting, the Information
Technology and Broadcasting Bureau said that as of August 1998,
over 75 percent of the government's critical computer and embedded
 systems had been confirmed to be year 2000 compliant and the
percentage would be raised to 85 percent by the year of the year.
</P>
<P>
For systems which could not achieve compliance by June 30,
1999, the departments concerned had already started drawing up
contingency plans.
</P>
<P>
The paper also revealed that the majority of system
rectification work in the financial services sector was expected
to be completed by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
For instance, about 97 percent of the banking institutions
were expected to achieve year 2000 compliance for their critical
systems by the end of this year and arrangements were being made
for industry-wide test planning and overall contingency planning
for the sector.
</P>
<P>
Good progress was also been achieved in the public utilities
sector, such as electricity and gas companies, telecom providers,
TV and radio broadcasters and other essential services providers.
</P>
<P>
To help remove misconceptions and to minimize unnecessary
anxiety in the community about the impact of the year 2000
problem, the government plans to launch another phase of publicity
program later this year. In addition, a comprehensive survey on
year 2000 compliance would be completed later this year, the paper
revealed.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong government has a web site
(http://www.year2000.gov.hk) on the Internet to update the public
the government's compliance work.

<P>
ATHENS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Greece and Finland agreed here
Monday that the two countries would step up efforts to promote a
joint foreign and security policy by the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Speaking after talks with visiting Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis said that both
Greece and Finland had suffered the adverse effects of bipolarity
and the experience had made them both more concerned about
regional cooperation and peace.
</P>
<P>
He said that there had been a great deal of emphasis placed on
the economy, but no solutions would be forthcoming if they did not
simultaneously support a joint foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Finland's proposal for a meeting between the EU, the U.S. and
Russia was considered in positive light by Greece, he said, adding
that such a meeting could provide a means to promote this foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
The premier also noted that Athens backed cooperation which
extended beyond the EU to solve problems that were not solely EU
issues.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, Ahtisaari, who arrived here Monday for a
four-day official visit to Greece, also met with his Greek
counterpart, Costis Stephanopoulos.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that the U.N. Security Council should have

NICOSIA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Arab ambassadors accredited
to Cyprus Monday expressed concern about the military alliance
between Israel and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting Monday of the Arab ambassadors to
Cyprus with the island's House of Representatives President,
Spyros Kyprianou, Egyptian Ambassador Mohamed Fadel Al-Kadi
expressed the Arab diplomats' opposition to the Israeli-Turkish
military alliance.
</P>
<P>
Al-Kadi told reporters that "I don't think the area needs such
alliances for the time being here when we are looking for a
peaceful solution for all the problems of the area."
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian ambassador said that "we cannot deny that we are
worried about it."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Arab diplomatic group's meeting with
Kyprianou, Al-Kadi said there was "a very good explanation for
the recent developments in Cyprus and the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou noted that his meeting with the group laid special
emphasis on the Israeli-Turkish alliance, as well as the possible
repercussions it might have on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel have enjoyed close military ties since 1996
when the two signed a military cooperation agreement.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz visited Israel,
during which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was
reported to have said that the central axis between his country

<HEADLINE> Foreign Troops Must Withdraw From Congo (K): </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GRAND BAIE, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A senior minister of the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) reiterated here Monday
afternoon that Rwandan and Ugandan troops should be withdrawn
from his country.
</P>
<P>
V. Mpoyo, a Congolese state minister, told reporters here
outside the International Conference Center where the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) summit meeting is still
going on that there are no rebels or even Tutsis in the Congo.
</P>
<P>
Those now fighting in the east of the country are backed by Rwanda
and Uganda after their several attempts to murder President Laurent
Kabila failed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Once these troops are withdrawn from the central African country,
the situation will return to normal, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the government army are still fighting in
the east of the country and that the SADC alliance, namely the troops
of Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola which are in the country to help prop
up Kabila's 16-month-old government, has not taken part in the
current fighting.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is improving," he added. People in some eastern
part of the country, such as Goma, are now answering the government
call in their efforts to restore peace in the area.
</P>
<P>
Mpoyo also said all members of the SADC are coming to understand
the stand taken by the Congolese government.
</P>
<P>
According to him, there will be a free election next year in his
country, in which any Congolese can participate.
</P>
<P>
The newly appointed Congolese Foreign Minister J.C. Okoto said
during the Non-Aligned Movement meeting early this month in South
Africa that his government is never opposed to democratic polls, but
such election must be held in accordance with the government's plan.
</P>
<P>
Kabila also said earlier that he was committed to hold free and
fair elections by June, 1999, despite what he termed as the aggression
of neighboring Uganda and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The conflict would not deter his administration's efforts to rebuild
the DRC into a great nation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said only through democratization could the long-twisted
potentials of the vast central African country be dug out.
</P>
<P>
The key to stability in the central African region is Congo's
peaceful transition to democracy, with a broad-based government which
absorbs all political sectors, they urged.

TIRANA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Armed rioters shot at and
bombed the office of Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano on Monday
after violence erupted over the death of opposition leader Azem
Hajdari.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of opposition supporters took to the streets of the
capital Tirana, gathering at Skanderbeg Square in the morning to
mourn for the politician who was murdered on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
During the ceremony, opposition leader Sali Berisha repeated
allegations that Nano was responsible for Hajdari's death.
</P>

Shooting broke out after mourners carried Hajdari's body to
Nano's office following the service at Skanderbeg Square.
Explosions could be heard inside the building as protesters hurled
grenades at the guards.
</P>
<P>
Rioters also seized tanks from the guards, and surrounded
national TV stations.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the country's largest ruling party, the
Socialist Party of Albania, was discussing solutions to the
turbulence.
</P>
<P>
Alarmed over the prospect of further instability, the United
States and the European Union appealed for calm, fearful the
turmoil could topple Albania's elected government and spread
elsewhere in the Balkans, including to neighboring Kosovo.

and hoped that it was the last such incident in the country.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Parliament Recommends Severing Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi National Assembly
(parliament) passed a resolution to sever all kinds of relations
with the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) authorized to
dismantle the Iraqi mass destruction weapons.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issed on Monday after an emergency session, the
assembly recommended the severing of relations with the UNSCOM and
halting all its activities in Iraq in case the U.N. Security Council
does not meet the Iraqi demands.
</P>
<P>
Iraq demands that U.N. resolution No. 1194 be annulled to pave
the way for "an open dialogue without threats".
</P>
<P>
The assembly authorized the Iraqi leadership to make
any decisions it deems appropriate to left the U.N.-imposed embargo
on the country in the light of the Iraqi decision on August 5
to suspend cooperation with the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the resolution No. 1194 was contrary to what Iraq
expected of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi assembly concluded by condemning the U.N. Security
Council resolution No. 1194 which put off the discussion on
lefting the embargo pending the retreat of Iraq from its former
decision suspending cooperation with the UNSCOM weapon inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that the resolution No. 1194 was passed
under pressures from the United States and Britain in violation of
Iraq's "territorial integrity and national sovereignty".
</P>
<P>
Iraq threatened in the last few weeks to adopt decisive steps
in case the U.N. Security Council delays the discussion of the
lefting of the embargo indefinitely.

<HEADLINE> Third World to Play Key Role to Save Ozone Layer: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Developing countries are s%t
to take central stage in the battle to save the ozone layer,
Klaus Topfer, chief of the Nairobi-based U.N. Environment Program
(UNEP), said in a statement issued Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The responsibility for saving the ozone layer is now to a
large extent with the developing countries," Topfer said on the
eve of the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone
Layer, which is to be marked worldwide Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Montreal Protocol, adopted in September 1987, allowed the
third world a grace period to phase out their consumption and
production of ozone depleting substances such as
chloro-fluoro-carbons (CFCs) and halons.
</P>
<P>
"Today, this grace period is almost over. The developing
countries must begin a phase-out of CFCs, halons and carbon
tetrachloride with a freeze starting July 1, 1999," the UNEP
statement noted.
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, the share of the developing countries and
Russia (then the Soviet Union) in the total production of CFCs
was 15 percent. In 1996, it was 80 percent. For halons, the share
was 7 percent ten years ago and hits 100 percent currently.
</P>
<P>
In 1986 the consumption of CFCs in the industrializcd
countries was about one million tons and now has been completely
phased out apart from some 15,000 tons for permitted essential
uses only, according to the U.N. data.
</P>
<P>
"The ozone hole will recover but only if they (the developing
countries) implement the control measures next year and complete
their phase-out according to schedule," said Topfer.
</P>
<P>
"The developing country phase-out will be a crucial challenge
for the next 10 years," also said Madhava Sarma, Executive
Secretary of the UNEP Ozone Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Under the Montreal Protocol, the Multilateral Fund has
disbursed about 760 million U.S. Dollars to more than 100
developing states to phase out more than half of their CFC
consumption. The replenishment for the 2000-2002 period will be
negotiated in late 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Montreal Protocol aims to protect the thin layer of ozone
in the stratosphere, located between 10 and 50 kilometers above
the earth, that absorbs all but a small fraction of the harmful
ultraviolet radiation from the sun and protects all life on
earth.
</P>
<P>
Scientific assessments show the abundance of ozone-depleting
chemicals in the lower atmosphere are declining thanks to the
protocol, and that the production of CFCs and halons have
declined by 86 percent in the last ten years.
</P>
<P>
Given full implementation of the protocol by all countries,
the ozone layer will recover by the middle of the 21st century.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai said in south Lebanon on Monday that Israel
would continue its efforts to conclude a security agreement with
Lebanon, the Orient radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The would-be agreement will provide security for Israel's
northern villages and towns, he said during an inspection tour
of Israeli forces in its occupied south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said that if such an agreement is reached, the
first thing Israel will do is to withdraw its troops from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 to allegedly protect its north from cross-border attacks by
Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, the Israeli Cabinet endorsed the
20-year-old United Nations Resolution 425, but linked the
implementation of the resolution with a negotiated security
agreement from the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its ally Syria firmly rejected the offer, asking
Israel to withdraw its troops from south Lebanon and then
negotiate a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, a strong advocate in Israel for a conditional
withdrawal initiative, said that Israeli forces will continue its
military operations in south Lebanon until an agreement is
reached with Lebanon.

geographically and having different social systems and cultural
traditions, the two countries have no outstanding disputes or
problems left over by history."

independence and adhere to foreign policies of peace. They also
share the same or similar views upon quite a number of major
international issues."

progress in exchanges and cooperation in the fields of politics,
economics, culture and education, hygiene and legislation, Zhu

cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He voiced his belief that "economic and trade cooperation
between the two countries will be raised to a new stage, given
joint efforts."
</P>
<P>
Zhu went on to say that the development of relations between
China and the European Union, including its member nations, have
shown a favorable trend over the past few years, with an
increasing number of mutual visits by senior leaders, and
consultations and dialogues at all levels becoming more active.
</P>
<P>
"China highly values the role the European Union plays in
global political and economic affairs, and hopes to set up with
the European Union a constructive partnership of long-term
stability oriented toward the 21st century," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the present world situation in which multi-polarization is
accelerated, enhanced cooperation and dialogue between China and
Europe are not only in accord with the fundamental interests of
both sides, but help to promote Asian-European cooperation and
maintain world peace, stability and development as well, he said.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Welcomes Investment by Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government is
ready to welcome Zimbabwean farmers to come and invest in the
agricultural sector in Manica and Tete provinces in the central
and northwestern parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Mozambican Minister of Agriculture and
Fisheries Carlos do Rosario recently while he was touring the two
provinces, a Noticias report said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will soon dispatch an expert team to the two
provinces to help the departments concerned to accelerate
procedures for absorbing the investment and make a survey and
estimate for the transfer of agricultural facilities, the
newspaper quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mossurize, Sussundenga and Barue counties in Manica Province
and Angonia County in Tete Province are the first four counties
selected to receive farmers from Zimbabwe, South Africa and
Malavi, he said, adding that these counties have fine
agricultural, ecological and climatic conditions for growing such
cash crops as tea, coffee, sun flowers, cotton, tobacco and
citruses, as well as maize, millet, sweet potatoes and other
grain crops.
</P>
<P>
The minister also listed social stability and a series of laws
including land law as guarantees to protect foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Farmers from Zimbabwe and other countries can bring in capital
and technology, while the Mozambican side will provide land and
infrastructures for mutually beneficial cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from simplifying investment procedures, the Mozambican
government has either reduced or exempted import duties for farm
machinery, insecticides and other materials necessary for
developing agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Foreign farmers can also bring in their livestock for breeding
in Mozambique and the import duties have already been reduced,
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
They can set up an association of their own and members can
get loans from the bank established by themselves.
</P>
<P>
In line with an agreement between South Africa and Mozambique,
about 25 South African farmers have engaged themselves in
agricultural development in Niassa Province in the north of
Mozambique since last September.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Irish Prime Ministers Hold Talks in Beijing (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zhu Rongji said Ireland, as member of the European Union (EU),
has made positive efforts to promote Sino-EU relations within the
EU, for which he expressed appreciation.
</P>
<P>
Thanking Ahern for his stance supporting China's entry into the
World Trade Organization (WTO), Zhu briefed him on China's
domestic economic situation and recent flood-control efforts.
</P>
<P>
Ahern passed on sympathy and condolences from his government
and people for the Chinese flood victims.
</P>
<P>
He exchanged views on bilateral relations and issues of common
interest with Zhu during April's Second Asia-Europe Meeting in
London, adding that he is convinced that his ongoing China tour
will serve to further the existing friendly ties between the two
nations.
</P>
<P>
Ahern noted that four Irish cabinet ministers have visited
China since the new Irish government assumed office, which he said
had laid a sound basis for his current visit.
</P>
<P>
He will strive to enhance Ireland-China ties and continue
efforts to expand exchanges and cooperation between the two
governments and two peoples, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Irish prime minister spoke highly of China's great economic
achievements as a major economy, and its role in the southeast
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said he would continue to encourage Irish business
people to strengthen economic and trade contacts with China and be
far-sighted in a bid to make bilateral economic and trade ties
score even greater progress.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Ireland will make every effort to support
China's entry into the WTO, which he said is in the interests of
both China and the European nations.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Ahern briefed Zhu on the peace process in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said China is glad to see a peace deal has been reached
among the Irish and British governments and the relevant parties
in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
China will positively support this peace process, he said,
adding that it also hopes that all relevant parties continue their
efforts, overcome difficulties and obstacles in the course of
progress and finally realize the permanent peace in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks, Zhu hosted a welcome ceremony in honor of
his Irish counterpart. After the talks, the two premiers attended
a signing ceremony for an agreement between the two governments on
civil air transport.
</P>
<P>
Ahern, who arrived here earlier today for a five-day official
visit to China as Zhu's guest, is the first Irish prime minister
to visit China since the two countries forged diplomatic relations
in 1979.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Beijing, Ahern is scheduled to meet with
President Jiang Zemin. And he will also visit Shanghai and the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

MOSCOW, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov Monday started his first working day by trying to
form a new government and searching for solutions to the country's
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, whose nomination was overwhelmingly approved at the
State Duma (lower house of parliament) on Friday, called for
tighter discipline and stringent observance of law at a meeting
with senior aides and former Acting Prime Minister Viktor

close in the past, the Itar-Tass news agency quoted Primakov as
saying.

in the financial and economic spheres," Primakov said. "In short,
we talked about everything, about all the aspects of the
government's policy."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chernomyrdin reaffirmed his plan to run in the
presidential elections in 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- More than 21 million people
in central China's Hunan Province, about one third of the local
population, were affected by this summer's devastating flooding of
the Yangtze River and Dongting Lake, according to a local official.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that direct industrial and agricultural losses
totalled 32.9 billion yuan (about 3.71 billion US dollars), said
Deng Lei, head of the Disaster Relief Division of the province's
Civil Affairs Department.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of June, severe flooding has ravaged over 100
counties and cities in Hunan, resulting in 629 deaths. The floods
have also inundated 14 county seats, affected 1.32 million ha of
farmland and destroyed 1.23 million houses, Deng said.
</P>
<P>
So far, 180,000 temporary shelters and 3,000 tents have been
set up, and the majority of the flood-affected people have been
properly taken care of, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the provincial government has earmarked 56 million
yuan and 12 million kg of grain for the flood victims, Deng said,
adding that donated funds, clothing and medicine are also being
sent to the flood-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that the authorities are still having
difficulties raising enough funds to rebuild houses, with a fund
shortage estimated at about 500 million yuan. There are still 1.3
million people who do not have sufficient clothes or bedding for
the coming winter, Deng said.
</P>
<P>
In another development, eastern China's Jiangsu Province today
announced that it had lifted the state of emergency along the
part of the Yangtze River that runs through it. The state of
emergency was imposed on July 27 to counter the worst flooding of
the Yangtze River since 1954.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait is to send a
batch of humanitarian assistance Monday to the famine-stricken
people in the southern Sudan, Kuwait News Agency (Kuna) reported.
</P>
<P>
Sudan is facing the heaviest flood in almost 50 years, which
has made thousands of Sudanese people homeless.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Sudan is deteriorating as the water level
of River Nile is still rising.
</P>
<P>
With the suffering of the Sudanese people, which has been
worsened by the spread of epidemic cholera, "the assistance
became a necessity to save people from starvation and
illness," the Kuwaiti official news agency Kuna said.
</P>
<P>
Although this is the sixth time this year Kuwait has sent
relief supplies to Arab or Islamic countries suffering from
disasters, it is the first time when Sudan receives humanitarian
aid from Kuwait since the Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic relations between Kuwait and Sudan were severed
after Kuwait was freed from the Iraqi occupation, because Sudan
had been one of the several Arab countries that sympathized with
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A sign of thaw of the relations between Kuwait and those it
termed as "hostile nations" emerged during the past couple of
years.
</P>
<P>
Some of the countries, including Sudan, expressed keenness to
resume normal ties with Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
In July last year, a senior official from the Sudanese Foreign
Ministry paid a visit to Kuwait, the first time in seven years.
</P>
<P>
The official expressed, during his stay, Sudan's support of
Kuwait's territorial sanctity, sovereignty and independence.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Center for Human
Settlements (Habitat) announced Monday that a Chinese mayor and a
river-protection project in southwestern China have won the 1998
World Habitat Awards together with other five recipients.
</P>
<P>
The awards will be presented on October 5, World Habitat Day,
at a global ceremony in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, said the
Nairobi-based agency in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Mu Suixin, Mayor ob Shenyang, northeastern China, won this
year's Habitat Scroll of Honor Awards because he "has been
instrumental in coordinating and implementing the UNCHS
(Habitat)-supported Sustainable Shenyang Project."
</P>
<P>
"Mayor Mu's political support to this project has created a
receptive environment for new urban management practices, which
are already transforming traditional decision-making mechanisms
by making them more cross-sectoral and more participatory," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Another winner from China is the Fu-Nan River Comprehensive
Revitalization Project in Chengdu, the capital city of Sichuan
Province.
</P>
<P>
Rapid economic and industrial development had led to the
deterioration of the physical environment in Chengdu, a city on
the banks of the Fu-Nan River, resulting in problems such as
floods and water pollution.
</P>
<P>
The project, since 1993 when it was started by the Chengdu
Municipal Government, has revitalized an area of four square
kilometers, including 188 roads and streets, 1,291 enterprises
and institutions and 30,000 households along the Fu Nan river.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, 18-kilometer dykes have been built in a bid
to prevent floods and the river has been dredged and widened.
</P>
<P>
The soil along the river has been covered with 23.53 hectares
of greenery to create ecological balance in the city.
</P>
<P>
The other winners are Brazil's Programa de Mobilizacao de
Comunidades, European Forum for Urban Security, Nigerian
Professor Akin L. Mabogunje, Russian scientist Vladimir
Kudryavtsev and Tunisia's Association des Habitants D'el Mourouj
2.
</P>
<P>
All these organizations and individuals are awarded due to
"their outstanding contributions to human settlements
development," said the Habitat.
</P>
<P>
This year's theme for World Habitat Day is "Safer Cities."

realize that the VFA is "for the national security."
</P>
<P>
He said the government welcomes various groups staging anti-VFA
demonstrations as long as they are peaceful because they are part
of a democratic process.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome these demonstrations. These are just part and
parcel of the debate. Demonstrations are one form of articulating
your views," Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
Militant groups have staged a series of demonstrations against
the controversial VFA, which if ratified, would pave the way for
military exercises between the Philippines and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of opponents staged demonstrations in front of the
U.S. Embassy in Manila last week. The police were forced to use
tear gas and clashed with the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada has repeatedly made clear that he
supports the ratification of the VFA.
</P>
<P>
"We support the president on that stand. And let the debate
ensue. I think that in the final analysis, the people will realize
that we need the Visiting Forces Agreement for our own national
security," Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
The VFA is currently pending in the Senate for approval.
Militant groups have labeled the VFA as part of the move for the
U.S. to re-establish a military base in the country which the
Philippine government strongly denied.

<HEADLINE> Flooding Affects Cotton Supply Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- This summer's flooding will
have a slight affect on the nation's cotton supply, according to
an official of the All-China Supply and Marketing Cooperative in
charge of cotton purchase.
</P>
<P>
"The yield is expected to drop somewhat, but China has an ample
supply of cotton in storage," said the woman official, adding that
"the textile industry still continues to face a sluggish market
and the demand for cotton will be met."
</P>
<P>
She predicted that cotton output will reach four million tons,
down close to 500,000 tons on last year's output.
</P>
<P>
She admitted that the floods in the Yangtze River since June
adversely affected the growth cycle in major cotton producing
areas, such as Hunan, Jiangxi and Hubei provinces.
</P>
<P>
"However, cotton is growing well in other areas in the Yangtze
River and Huanghe River valleys and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region," according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Statistics through the middle of August show that floods
affected 530,000 ha. of cotton, including the total destruction of
crops on 130,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the State Development Planning Commission
lowered the purchase price in April, planting cotton continues to
be profitable than growing other crops. Cotton has been planted on
4.3 million ha for 1998, with the acreage basically equalling last
year's level.
</P>
<P>
She noted that low temperatures and abnormal precipitation in
the early and middle parts of the growth cycle will extend the
normal maturation period by as much as two weeks.

<HEADLINE> China Boosts Presense in ITU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- China is boosting its role as
a standard setter in the global telecommunications market by
enlarging its presense in the International Telecommunications
Union (ITU).
</P>
<P>
At a Study Group 7 meeting of the ITU standardization
department which opened here today, China put forward six
suggestions for consideration at the 14-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
This is the first high-level meeting of the influential
international body to be held in China.
</P>
<P>
Wen Ku, a Ministry of Information Industry (MII) official who
presided at the meeting, said this marked China's change from a
passive follower into a standard setter in the field of data
network and open system communications.
</P>
<P>
According to Hu Junhua, head of the Chinese delegation, the six
suggestions they made include adding a Chinese language function
to data communications networks, and running Internet protocol
(IP) over fiber optical networks.
</P>
<P>
She said these innovative technologies have been uniquely
developed by China and, if accepted by ITU as universal standards,
will open up a huge market for China's technology and equipment,
and enhance the competitiveness of the country's
telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 120 million telephone lines and boasts
the second-largest telecommunications network in the world,
expected to become the world's largest by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
Herb Bertine, chairman of the Study Group 7 of the ITU, said
China has been increasing its presense in ITU standardization
department activities.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that with 188 members around the world, the ITU wields
great power in influencing the adoption of technical and service
standards in the world's telecommunications market. She said that
no one can afford to loose markets by ignoring the standardization
suggestions of the ITU.
</P>
<P>
China has set forth its own candidate for director of the ITU
standardization department, to be decided by election at a ITU
meeting later this year.

<HEADLINE> State Launches Inspection of Amusement Rides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The State Quality and
Technology Supervision Bureau has issued a circular on the
carrying out of quality inspection on all the rides in amusement
parks and other places across the country.
</P>
<P>
The inspection is aimed at guarding against and preventing
accidents caused by such rides because of quality problems and the
poor management of amusement parks, the circular said.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, a number of such accidents
have taken place, causing the loss of both lives and property. In
an extreme case, which took place in Zhabei Park in Shanghai City
on August 30, one person was killed and eight others injured.
</P>
<P>
The State Quality Inspection Center of Amusement Rides and the
quality and technology supervision departments at provincial
levels are required to launch inspection on both the production
and sales of rides, and shut down enterprises without safety
certificates, the circular said.
</P>
<P>
The rides and other facilities in amusement parks which have
been found to have safety problems and have been repaired, should
pass inspection by quality and technology departments at
provincial levels before they are allowed to re-start operations.
</P>
<P>
Rides which are beyond repair should be scrapped, according to
the circular.
</P>
<P>
The quality and technology supervision departments across the
country are to report the results of the inspection to the State
Quality and Technology Supervision Bureau by the end of October.

<HEADLINE> Security Issues Balk Progress in Talks: Ross </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Middle East peace
envoy Dennis Ross said Monday that no progress has been made in
his effort to finalize an agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians, noting the disputes centered on security issues.
</P>
<P>
The main problem between the two sides now was Israel's demand
for reciprocity and the lack of Palestinian response to Israel's
security requirements, Israel Radio quoted Ross as telling Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a meeting Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Ross is on a renewed mission to bridge the gaps between Israel
and the Palestinians over the long overdue Israeli withdrawal from
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
He has held separate talks with Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat and Netanyahu since he arrived in the
region last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The envoy traveled to Egypt Sunday to update President Hosni
Mubarak on his talks with the Israeli and Palestinian leaders.
Egypt plays a mediating role in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ross has succeeded in resuming meetings of several committees
from Israel and the Palestinians working on interim issues such
as the airport and seaport in Gaza, and safe passage between Gaza
and the West Bank. The committees broke off their work four months
ago.
</P>
<P>
Israeli cabinet secretary Danny Naveh and senior Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat, heads of the steering committees, met
Sunday night at U.S. Ambassador Edward Walker's house and
discussed these secondary issues.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai expressed optimism
Monday over the Israeli-Palestinian talks. He was quoted by
Israel Radio as saying that if the Palestinians showed
flexibility by coordinating Israeli demands with the American
initiative, then it would be possible to sign an agreement soon.
</P>
<P>
The American initiative calls on Israel to pullback troops from
a further 13.1 percent of the West Bank in exchange for
Palestinian measures to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
But Israel is demanding that 3 percent to be handed over to the
Palestinians be designated as a nature reserve, where Israel
would retain full security control. The Palestinians rejected the
idea.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea Likely to Buy Missile Defense System in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 14 (Xinhua) -- South Korea is considering
buying a U.S.-made Patriot or Russian S-300 missile defense system
in the year 2000, Defense Minister Chun Yong-taek said Monday.
</P>
<P>
South Korea suspended the plan to purchase a missile defense
system last year because of the high cost, the minister said at a
press conference 15 days after the Democratic Peoples Republic of
Korea (DPRK) launched a rocket to place a satellite into orbit.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Russian and U.S. officials reportedly lobbied
fiercely to sell their defense systems to South Korea.
</P>
<P>
A report said that the U.S.-made Patriot system costs more than
one billion U.S. dollars, but the Russian one is cheaper.
</P>
<P>
However, some South Korean military officers are skeptical
about the effectiveness of any air-defense system because of the
proximity of Seoul and key military bases to the DPRK border, it
said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. forces in South Korea have reportedly deployed a Patriot
battalion to protect its key bases there.

<HEADLINE> Judiciary Shake-Up Successful (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Xiao Yang said the courts discovered 14,993 wrong judgements in
respect to the application of law in cases self-examined in the
first eight months this year, and in re-examined already-concluded
trials. They have corrected 8,110 wrong verdicts, and the others
are being addressed according to law, he said.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors also found 1,454 mishandled litigations out of a
total of nearly 50,000 criminal lawsuits, and have corrected 1,255
of them, top-prosecutor Han said.
</P>
<P>
Both courts and prosecutorial offices opened hotlines to
solicit public reports on illegal activities by their
employees. Courts received over 12,000 reports in the first eight
months this year, placed nearly 5,000 judges on file for
investigation, judged 4,701 of them guilty, and had 131 punished
as criminal offenders.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, prosecutorial offices put 1,337 prosecutors under
investigation, concluded the examination of 777 of them,
disciplined 756, and brought legal proceedings against 73.
</P>
<P>
While affirming the results of the rectification movement, both
Xiao and Han admitted that they "cannot overestimate the
achievements and many problems should not be ignored." For
instance, some courts or procuratorates have treated this
rectification movement as only a formality; some deep rooted
problems are left untouched; judicial leaders have done little to
expose themselves and many blame objective conditions instead of
themselves for the spread illegal practices.
</P>
<P>
Both Xiao and Han said they will further their efforts in
uncovering and punishing illegal practices in their own
departments. Han said that this work is an important criterion for
the shake-up movement.
</P>
<P>
All the other specific measures required for the movement
will also be enforced, they said, to maintain the dignity and
unity of the law and ensure justice for the ultimate goal of
maintaining social stability and contributing to the country's
reform, opening up and economic development.

<HEADLINE> India Says Clinton's Visit Likely to Be Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister's
Principle Secretary Brajesh Mishra said Monday that U.S. President
Bill Clinton's planned visit to India in November this year is
likely to be postponed.
</P>
<P>
This is the first open announcement by a senior Indian official
of possible postponement of Clinton's visit to India. Since India
conducted nuclear tests in May this year, the U.S. side has kept
saying that the president's visit to South Asian countries was
under review.
</P>
<P>
Clinton planned to visit Pakistan, India and Bangladesh in
November this year in a bid to enhance mutual understanding and
cooperation between America and the three nations, yet the nuclear
tests by India and Pakistan have made the visit uncertain.
</P>
<P>
Together with other countries, the United States not only
condemned the nuclear tests by the two countries, but also imposed
economic sanctions on them. In its four rounds of talks with the
two countries, the United States strongly urged them to stop
further nuclear tests and sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
(CTBT) with no conditions.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, the United States has linked progress of
the talks with the visit.
</P>
<P>
Mishra said that India is willing to go forward towards signing
the CTBT provided the question of its linkage to disarmament is
worked out. He made it clear that India is not very close to
signing CTBT. He said that negotiations were going on with the
United States and some other countries.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the government's planned talks with political
parties on the CTBT, Mishra said that meetings would begin this
week to seek consensus on the issue.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton's advisers flooded the Sunday talk
shows in an effort to blunt the momentum building in Congress
for a formal impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov pledged to turn Russia
toward a "socially oriented economy," distancing himself form the
capitalist-oriented policies engendered by governments here
since the collapse of the Soviet system seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States began in earnest the wrenching debate
that could determine the future of Bill Clinton's presidency. In
interviews around the country, people expressed revulsion at the
president's behavior but reluctance to put the nation through
the trauma of a presidential resignation or impeachment.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The IMF pledged to support Brazil if the country needs
funds to defend its currency. Brazil's stock market surged 13
percent, but the regional giant remains under pressure from
investors.
</P>
<P>
-- Northwest pilots approved a new four-year contract. But
the strike's effects are likely to linger, as Northwest said it
expects to post losses in the third and fourth quarters and for
all of 1998. The airline began recalling workers who had been
temporarily laid off and announced a plan to return to its full
schedule by Sept. 21.

<HEADLINE> Rouble Devaluation Affects Border Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The massive devaluation of the
Russian rouble since mid-August has affected the tourism industry
on the Sino-Russian border, according to official sources in this
capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
"Both the number of Russian tourists entering China and the
number of vehicles going through the Manzhouli checkpoint have dived
some 30 percent since August 17," a Chinese border official told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The rouble was traded at 6.6 to the US dollar on August 17, but
its exchange rate plunged to 21.2 to the US currency in the following
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
The past regular scenes of long lines of vehicles waiting to
enter and exit China are rarely seen now, the official said.
</P>
<P>
At a border market on the Chinese side, pedlars had little to
do, as business was extremely slow.
</P>
<P>
"I have sold nothing in the past two days," a woman shopkeeper
said. "Without the Russians, we are almost out of business," she
added.
</P>
<P>
Customs statistics show that the number of Russian
pedlars travelling to China has fallen by 90 percent since August
17. Moreover, the purchasing power of those who do come has
dropped significantly.

<HEADLINE> Khamenei Calls on Islamic World to Rescue Afghan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei Monday called on the Islamic countries and
world Muslims to rescue the oppressed nation of Afghanistan,
Tehran radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei made the call in a strong-worded statement issued here
following the conquer of the Afghan Taliban militia on Bamyan,
the center of Afghan Shiite Muslims in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"I call on all the governments of the Muslim countries, the
freedom-loving nations of the Islamic world to rescue the
oppressed Afghan people from the Taliban's massacre," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the Pakistani people not to allow the Pakistani
soldiers to participate in the massacre of millions of Afghan
people and to prevent the religious war in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The criminal actions committed by the Taliban in Mazari
Sharif, northern Afghanistan with massacre of civilians and the
Iranian diplomats and correspondent, obligated the Muslim nations
around the world to take a decisive action against the savage
group, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban announced on Thursday that they found the bodies of
nine of the 11 missing Iranian diplomats. Iran later confirmed
the death of the nine diplomats and the reporter, but said that
two others escaped the Taliban's massacre.
</P>
<P>
Local observers believed that the strong-worded statement
indicated a quite possibility for Iran to take measures against
the Taliban, as senior Iranian officials repeatedly announced to
take revenge on the Taliban for killing Iranian diplomats.

<HEADLINE> Aids Threatens S. African Labor Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 14 (Xinhua) -- South African workforce is
being threatened by fastest growing Aids epidemic in the world, local
daily Business Day reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1,500 new HIV infections in South Africa every day.
By the year of 2000, more than 20 percent of workforce in the country
will be HIV positive, according to a report released at a Partnerships
Against Aids Conference held in Pretoria at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The conference, attracting political, business, medical and labor
leaders, was aimed at alerting participants to the seriousness of the
Aids problem in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Welfare Minister Geraldine Fraser Moleketi was quoted as saying
that about 4.5 million adults would be HIV positive by 2005. By the
end of 1997, it was estimated that three million people had been
infected.
</P>
<P>
Moleketi said South Africa had about 200,000 orphans who had lost
their parents to Aids and this figure could go up to one million in a
few years.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma, who participated in the conference,
also said that with such a high number of young, economically active
people being HIV infected, South African market base would shrink.
</P>
<P>
She said it was important for business to get involved to promote
Aids awareness.

<HEADLINE> Mullah Omar Asks Taliban to Protect POWs in Bamyan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Leader of the Afghan
Taliban militia Mullah Muhammad Omar has asked the Taliban forces
in central Afghan province of Bamyan to protect the POWs and
common people.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press of Pakistan quoted Taliban Spokesman Wakil
Ahmad Mutawakil as saying Monday Omar's message has been given to
the Taliban forces in Bamyan.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the Taliban forces have been asked to
treat the POWs and common people in Bamyan, the central Afghan
province which fell into the Taliban's control Sunday, in a good
manner and protect their lives.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban are reported to have entered Bamyan city and the
opposition forces have fled from the area without any resistance,
leaving behind their arms and military hardware.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to another report from the Afghan capital
of Kabul, the Taliban militia continued its advance through the
opposition-controlled territory Monday, while reinforcing its
western borders with Iran where 200,000 Iranian soldiers are to
conduct a massive military exercise.
</P>
<P>
There were also reports of as many as 10,000 fresh Taliban
soldiers being sent to western Afghan province of Herat which
borders Iran.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the Taliban-run Radio Shariat warned Iran against a
military assault on its territory, saying that "we have enough
solders to resist any attack."
</P>
<P>
Relations between the Taliban militia and Tehran nose dived
last month following the killing of nine Iranian diplomats by the
Taliban soldiers during their attack on the major northern Afghan
town of Mazar-i-Sharif.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Meets U.N. Human Rights High Commissioner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During a meeting with Robinson here today, Qian said this year
marks the 50th anniversary of the world declaration on human
rights. Over the past 50 years, with unremitting efforts, the
international community has scored many achievements in the field
of human rights including the collapse of centuries-old
colonialism, and apartheid in South Africa, Qian said, adding that
the rights of women, children and other social groups have also
drawn the common attention of the international community.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has played an important role in this
progress, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that a peaceful international environment is the
first prerequisite for enhancing and protecting human rights, and
all nations should foster and promote friendly ties with each
other and settle their differences through equal dialogues on the
basis of the U.N. Charter and the Five-Principles of Peaceful
Co-Existence.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government attaches importance to
cooperation with the United Nations in the area of human rights
and has joined 17 international covenants on human rights. China
signed the international covenant on economic, social and cultural
rights last October, and will sign the international covenant on
civil and political rights next month, Qian told Robinson.
</P>
<P>
China appreciates the fact that Robinson has proposed dialogue
and cooperation and advocates that all human rights should be
equally underlined ever since she became the U.N. high
commissioner for human rights, Qian noted.
</P>
<P>
Robinson said that China has played an important role in
safeguarding world peace and security as a permanent member of the
U.N. Security Council. China supports the purpose and principles
of the U.N. Charter, and has actively participated in
international affairs including human rights, acceding to many
international covenants on human rights.
</P>
<P>
She said she was quite impressed by the great progress made
by the Chinese government in promoting and protecting human rights.
</P>
<P>
Robinson arrived in China on September 6 at the invitation of
the Chinese government. During her stay she has held talks with
the leaders of China's Foreign Ministry, the Supreme People's
Court, the Justice Ministry and other departments.
</P>
<P>
She also toured Shanghai and Tibet, as well as Beijing.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, September 14 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province
today set up an ocean research institute in the coastal city of
Qingdao in a bid to make its advantages in oceanographic studies
serve the economic growth better.
</P>
<P>
Shao Guifang, deputy governor of Shandong, said the institute
will mainly shoulder the tasks of organizing major oceanographic
development projects, offering consultancy to local governments,
building a key laboratory for oceanographic studies and
oceanographic information network, in addition to fostering
leading researchers in the field.
</P>
<P>
Shandong has now nearly 200 institutions specializing in
oceanographic studies and teaching, with a total staff of more
than 2,000, said Shao.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, Shandong put forward the strategy of developing the
ocean through science and technology. The province reaped added
value totalling 36.6 billion yuan (about 4.4 billion U.S. dollars)
from its marine industry last year.

<HEADLINE> Judiciary Shake-up Successful (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) - In an unprecedented internal
shake-up of the judiciary, China reshuffled a considerable number
of courts and prosecutorial offices and disciplined nearly 5,000
judges and prosecutors in the first eight months this year.
</P>
<P>
Courts had also corrected 8,110 misjudged cases by August and
prosecutors reconsidered 1,125 mishandled criminal offenses by
July.
</P>
<P>
President of the Supreme People's Court Xiao Yang and
Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Han
Zhubin revealed these figures today when reporting to the Civil
and Judiciary Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) on
their work in the "Intensified Educational Rectification Movement."
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the top legislature, the NPC Standing Committee, Li
Peng, and vice-chairman Cao Zhi attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The rectification movement was begun during the central
government's new term in March in response to criticism by
NPC members.
</P>
<P>
As part of this movement, the general public, including NPC
deputies, were invited to air their dissatisfaction with judges
and prosecutors and comment on their work. Courts and
procuratorates were asked to focus on their own illegal practices,
especially those long-pending cases which have drawn public
complaints. The internal check and balance system was also
strengthened to consolidate the results of this campaign.
</P>
<P>
In terms of leadership, 177 courts at provincial, prefectural
and county levels have been reshuffled and unqualified leaders
removed; 326 prefectural level and 1,827 county level
prosecutorial offices have been scrutinized by the Party's
organizational departments and higher offices, which also led to
rectification of prosecutorial offices with weak or corrupt
leadership.

<HEADLINE> Planning Official Recommends Moderately Fast Growth for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- China needs to pursue
moderately fast growth of seven to eight percent for the remaining
years up to the end of this century, after having maintained a
growth momentum of ten percent for the past 20 years, according to
a planning official here today.
</P>
<P>
"It is inappropriate for the Chinese economy to keep a high
growth of 10 percent for the coming years, given the new changes
occurring in the economic system, and in supply and demand, as
well as the global economy," Bai Hejin, secretary general of the
State Development Planning Commission (SDPC), told an ongoing
forum.
</P>
<P>
Bai said any economic growth target needs to be based on the
potential of an economy, and that China's economy will be aiming
at a growth of seven percent for the first ten years in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the accelerated growth in investment, consumption
and production from the second half of this year, Bai said it is
possible for the national economy to grow by eight percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
"Even if the growth is a bit lower than eight percent, it will
still be one of the fastest growths in the world," Bai added.
</P>
<P>
Also a spokesman for the SDPC, Bai predicted that China's
economy will pursue growth of seven to eight percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"If the national economic growth can stay near eight percent in
1998, a growth of 6.8 percent for the next two years will be
enough for the Chinese economy to reach the growth target of eight
percent for the Ninth Five Year Plan period (1996-2000)," said Bai.
</P>
<P>
Bai also noted that the growth target of eight percent this
year has actually been set as a psychological lever, in view of
the past high growth mode, the increasing unemployment pressure
due to economic restructuring and the wavering confidence of
overseas investors in the Chinese economy.
</P>
<P>
"Rapid growth is not the only thing we want to pursue, and
economic growth should never be obtained at the cost of the
quality of the economy, " warned Bai.

<HEADLINE> Peace Talks With NDF Still Open: Philippine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Presidential
Palace maintained that peace talks with the National Democratic
Front (NDF) rebels remain open, but under two non-negotiable
conditions, Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Barican said the fate of the talks are in the hands of NDF
Chief Political Consultant Jose Maria Sison and NDF Chief
Negotiator Luis Jalandoni who, he stressed, have to be "more
reasonable with their demands for the sake of lasting peace and
development in the country."
</P>
<P>
Barican said the government is ready to resume talks with the
NDF provided that the negotiation is pursued within the framework
of the Philippine Constitution and that the implementation of the
agreement on human rights and international humanitarian law
should apply to both parties.
</P>
<P>
"The ball now is in the court of the NDF...The communication
lines remain open, including back channels of communications to
resolve the impasse," Barican added.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora was hopeful
that the two panels would return to the negotiating table but
under clearly defined status -- as the Philippine government and a
rebel group talking peace.
</P>
<P>
"We could not proceed under the premise that there are two
governments in the country. Once they recognize that they are
talking to the government of the Philippines, we will be back
within a day," he said.
</P>
<P>
With the approval of the President, the government panel
suspended peace talks with the NDF after the rebel group made
"misleading" statements that the two panels have agreed to conduct
the peace talks outside of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The NDF is one of the major rebel groups operating in the
southern Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong, Silicon Valley Forge Technology Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong and Silicon
Valley have forged business and technology ties in face of the
challenges of the knowledge-based 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Industrial Technology Center (Tech Center) and
the Economic Development Alliance for Business (EDAB) of East Bay
Region in Silicon Valley signed a joint partnership agreement here
Monday, promising to promote exchange of technology, information
and expertise between academia, research institutes and
enterprises in the two places.
</P>
<P>
Silicon Valley, the home to 7,000 technology-based companies,
is the very epitome of innovation and cutting-edge technology,
leading the world in issuing patents, attracting venture capital
and creating new products.
</P>
<P>
Lee Grissom, secretary of California Trade and Commerce Agency,
spoke at Monday's signing ceremony: "It (the agreement) is a
statement of trust between California and Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
"We are both in the Pacific Rim and facing the challenges of
the information age. Our future is intertwined, and we shall share
technology and skill and work together to ensure a prosperous
future," said the secretary.
</P>
<P>
Dr James Liu, chief executive officer of Hong Kong's Tech
Center, said on the same occasion: "The new alliance with the EDAB
can bring technology, knowledge, support and business
opportunities from Silicon Valley to Hong Kong and back again."
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the two organizations will link up
respective Internet databases, support technology matchmaking, and
foster global business expansion.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, they will join hands to facilitate business
collaboration and technology application between the two regions
in such key areas as telecommunications, environmental,
electronic, biotechnology, software and multimedia industries.
</P>
<P>
It is the third partnership document Hong Kong has signed with
other technology and innovation hubs; the first two were inked
with Guangzhou and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1993, the Tech Center is a statutory body charged
with the mission to promote application of new technology in Hong
Kong industry, while EDAB plays a similar role in the East Bay
Region in Silicon Valley.

<HEADLINE> No Presidential System in Israel: Netanyahu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday ruled out the possibility of
introducing the presidential system in Israel.
</P>
<P>
A statement released by Netanyahu's office said that even it is
a good idea, there is no point of discussing the initiative which
has absolutely no chance of being approved by the Knesset
(parliament).
</P>
<P>
The idea was suggested by Avigdor Liberman, former director
general of Netanyahu's office. The proposed new system will give
the prime minister the authority similar to that of president of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Liberman said that the new system will enable the prime
minister to concentrate on matters of the state and be relieved of
dealing with coalition issues.
</P>
<P>
Should such a system be introduced, he noted, there will be no
need for Israel to have a president.
</P>
<P>
Liberman, s member of ruling Likud party, said that the
central committee of his party will discuss the idea.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Rafel Eitan, leader of Tzomet
party, severely criticized the proposal, which he called was "part
of a political plan to take over the power of the country and turn
it into a totalitarian regime."
</P>
<P>
So far all Israeli governments have been based on coalition of
several parties, since no party has ever received enough Knesset
seats to form a government by itself.
</P>
<P>
And the prime minister has to balance the interests in the
coalition before he makes a resolution.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
met with Mary Robinson, United Nations high commissioner for human
rights, here today. They had a friendly talk on international
cooperation for promoting, advancing and safeguarding human rights.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China is a developing country with a population of
1.2 billion. "To develop and protect human rights, we should first
take into account our national conditions. That is to place
economic growth in priority in order to feed and clothe the
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, China places democratic and legal
development in an important position in the process of economic
growth, and the advancement of civil and political rights for
the people through judiciary and executive measures.
</P>
<P>
"China will further expand socialist democracy, improve the
socialist legal system, rule the country according to law,
build up a socialist nation of the rule of law, ensure that the
people enjoy extensive rights and liberty, and respect and
safeguard human rights," he stressed.
</P>

Robinson told Jiang that as the first UN human rights high
commissioner to visit China, she was delighted to tour Beijing,
Tibet and Shanghai, and that she considers her visit "helpful and
valuable."
</P>
<P>
During her journey she witnessed the socio-economic progress
made by China over recent years. "China has scored a tremendous
accomplishment in promoting and protecting the economic, social
and cultural rights of its people," she said. She was also deeply
impressed by the efforts made by China to strengthen legal
construction and carry out legal reform.
</P>
<P>
China, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, is a
responsible country, she noted, adding that her office is willing
to strengthen human rights cooperation with China.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Opposition Blocks House Session Over Crucial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Nepal's main opposition
party Monday disrupted the proceedings in the Lower House of
Parliament for the fourth day over a crucial bill.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the session started in the House, MPs of the
Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML)
shouted slogans in protest against the Local Autonomy Bill.
</P>
<P>
They demanded a provision which automatically terminates one's
post if a local elected-official defects to other parties be added
into the bill, which was tabled in parliament last week.
</P>
<P>
The party fears that if the bill is passed, thousands of local
party workers may defect to its rival group, the Communist Party
of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML), which broke away from it in
March this year and joined the minority government of the Nepali
Congress (NC) late last month.
</P>
<P>
Most of the mayors, deputy mayors, district development
committee chairmen, vice chairmen and members elected from the
CPN-UML during the local elections in May and July last year have
joined the CPN-ML. Thus their political future hinges on the bill.
</P>
<P>
More local elected-members are said to be wishful to join the
CPN-ML, but are waiting for the bill to be passed in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the CPN-ML aimed to get the bill
passed in parliament in order to win over more workers for the
next general elections due to be held before November 1999.
</P>
<P>
With a comfortable majority of 128 seats in the 205-member
house, the NC and the CPN-ML can easily get the bill passed.
</P>
<P>
The bill had been approved by an overwhelming majority of votes
in the Parliamentary Committee on Development before being
presented to the House for discussion and vote.
</P>
<P>
But CPN-UML MPs say that the bill is against the norms of the
multi-party democracy and should be returned to the parliamentary
committee for further discussion.

<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing-based Association
for Relations Across the Straits (ARATS) has urged political
dialogue with its counterpart in Taiwan as the prelude to possible
political talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent Monday to the Strait Exchange Foundation (SEF)
in Taiwan, ARATS expressed appreciation for recent remarks by some
people in Taiwan about political talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"We hope ARATS and SEF will conduct political dialogue at the
earlist possible date, and thereby make arrangements for
procedural talks prior to political talks across the straits," the
letter said.
</P>
<P>
The letter reiterated the principles for political talks
expounded in late August by officials in charge of Taiwan Affairs
in the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the
State Council which said that talks should first be focused on
"officially terminating hostilities across the straits under the
principle of one China".
</P>
<P>
ARATS and SEF should first exchange views on procedural
arrangements for political talks and then resume economic and
business talks, the officials suggested.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for Taliban Leaders' International Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran's special envoy on
Afghan affairs Alaeddin Boroujerdi on Monday called for a trial of
leaders of the Afghan Taliban militia by an international court
for "racial and religious cleansing in Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency IRNA, Boroujerdi made
the call in a speech at Tehran University and said that the
Taliban's killing of Iranian diplomats and reporter would not be
unanswered.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban on Thursday admitted the death of nine Iranian
diplomats by its renegade troops in Mazar-e-Sharif in northern
Afghanistan on August 8 when the group took over the city. Iran
later said that an IRNA reporter was also killed by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said a technical team of the International Committee of
the Red Cross accompanied by an Iranian technical team was
dispatched to Afghanistan before Monday noon to transfer the
bodies of the killed back to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Popular demand for revenge has been mounting in Iran.
Boroujerdi said that it would not be difficult for Iran to conquer
Afghanistan, but the policy of the Iranian government was based on
non-interference and restoration of permanent peace in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He said the Taliban obtained the victories with direct
interference of Pakistan. However, he said, the Afghan people
would not tolerate such an intervention, and historical experience
showed that the Afghan people would not remain silence towards
foreign presence in their country.
</P>
<P>
Iran has reportedly been supporting the opposition forces,
which now seemed unable to resist the preponderance of the student
militia, who already controlled over 90 percent of the country and
imposed a strict version of Islamic rule there.
</P>
<P>
Boroujerdi said that Iran recalled 70 percent of its diplomats
three days before the fall of Mazar-e-Sharif, the opposition's
stronghold in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Iranian foreign ministry discussed the situation in Afghanistan
and decided to keep 30 percent of its diplomatic mission in the
city according to previous experience, he explained.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government Bonds in Short Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Investors' demand for
government bonds outstrips supply by more than 150 billion baht
(375 million U.S. dollars) in Thailand, the Thai Bond Dealing
Center said.
</P>
<P>
For institutional investors such as mutual funds and insurance
firms, government bonds offer higher returns with lower risks than
equities, property and corporate debt, the center said in a
statement available here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Development of the bond market has been hampered by thin
liquidity and the lack of a benchmark for pricing new issues. As
well, years of fiscal surpluses meant that few government bonds
were issued.
</P>
<P>
The few issues available were purchased mainly by local
financial institutions and held to fulfill reserve requirements,
resulting in little trading.
</P>
<P>
But Thailand's economic crisis has forced the government to
issue more bonds to raise capital to offset declining tax revenues
and the cost of financial reform.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the government approved the issue of 500
billion baht (42.5 billion U.S. dollars) worth of domestic bonds
to refinance the liabilities of the Financial Institutions
Development Fund (FIDF).
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand has already auctioned more than 125
billion bath (312 million dollars) worth of one-year bonds since
June 22.
</P>
<P>
To help establish a benchmark and yield curve for the market,
the central bank last week began auctioning longer-maturity
government bonds. Last Friday, it issued 10.39 billion baht (250
million dollars) worth of two-, three- and five-year bonds.
</P>
<P>
Investors' demand has grown steadily over the past several
months. The first sale of one-year bonds in June had an accepted
yield of 12.75 percent, versus 11.9 percent in the latest sale.
Lower yields mean higher prices at auction, indicating high
investors' demand.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Offer One-Stop Service for Top Taxpayers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Revenue Department of
Thailand is to give comprehensive services to 500 companies which
are the top taxpayers of the department, a statement of the
department available Monday said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the department plans to establish a
special office to give comprehensive services to the 500 top
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
The companies account for 80 percent of the department's tax
take, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
For fiscal 1998, which ends this month, the department expects
tax collections to reach 488 billion baht (12.2 billion U.S.
dollars), while next fiscal year's target has been set at 530
billion baht (13.25 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
To increase efficiency in tax collection, the department
intends to make the office a one-stop service for these companies.
</P>
<P>
Apart from smoothing the payment process, the office will
advise on tax problems and provide tax-related information ranging
from changes in laws to announcements on tax matters.
</P>
<P>
The department hopes the establishment of the special office
will increase the government's tax haul and that taxpayers will
become more willing to pay as procedures become much more
convenient.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said that an expert has been assigned by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) to work closely with the
department for one year to establish the office and help the
department streamline its operation.
</P>
<P>
Increasing tax collection efficiency has been included in
Thailand's latest commitments to the IMF.

<P>
The railway line will link Beijing and Shanghai, and the
train's speed will exceed 200 kilometers per hour. A number of
countries are in bidding competition to provide rails for the
construction of the line.
</P>
<P>
Scientists and technicians from the Panzhihua Steel
Corporation, the country's largest manufacturer of railway tracks,
located in southwest China's Sichuan Province, will join in the
competition, sources said.
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping that the new railway line will use domestic-made
rails," said Hong Jibi, president of the corporation. He revealed
that the corporation has the capability of making high-speed rails
of equal quality to foreign-made ones.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, China opened a 160-kilometer-per-hour railway line
between Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and the rails for this line were
produced by Hong's corporation.
</P>
<P>
Hong said his corporation has increased investment in its

<HEADLINE> Round-up: South Korea Trying to Stimulate Ailing Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 14 (Xinhua) -- South Korea announced an
economic stimulus package last week after its economy plunged into
a deeper recession featured by sharp contraction of the gross
domestic product and domestic consumption in the past months.
</P>
<P>
The package, which highlights a boost in domestic demand,
includes measures to expand the money supply, increase credit
guarantees for small and medium enterprises, exporters and housing
builders, and enlarge consumer financing instruments for durable
goods such as houses.
</P>
<P>
The measures came when indicators for industrial activity
showed unprecedented bad results and businesses were complaining
that unless prompt measures were taken immediately, the ailing
economy would slip into an irreversible slump.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the central Bank of Korea registered a 6.6 percent
decline in GDP in the second quarter of this year, the worst
performance in the past 18 years, which came after a 3.9 percent
contraction in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The nation's economy showed a negative growth for seven months
in a row since January while output fell to minus 10.8 percent
from a 3 percent last December.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predicted deeper contractions of the gross domestic
product and domestic consumption because of wage cuts and mass
layoffs in the coming months of the year.
</P>
<P>
The package is described as the best option the government has
to take to keep the country's hard-earned economic foundation from
collapsing due to measures imposed by the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) last December. The country signed an agreement with the
monetary body at that time for a bailout loan of 58 billion
U.S. dollars after suffering a financial crisis triggered by
corporate bankruptcies and bad loans of financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The government said it had originally planned to put forward
the stimulus package in October this year as soon as the current
economic restructuring almost ends.
</P>
<P>
Under a government-proposed restructuring scheme, 55 nonviable
companies were forced out and five troubled commercial banks were
shut down in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, extensive institutional reforms were implemented.
The regulatory framework on financial institutions was reinforced
while measures to enhance corporate transparency were taken.
</P>
<P>
The government's stimulus plan is believed to be designed to
ease the credit crunch, in which more than 17,000 enterprises
collapsed after the IMF-imposed austerity measures were put into
force.
</P>
<P>
However, officials said if the central bank expands the money
supply sharply, credit woes could be relieved to a certain extent
even though the ailing financial system has yet to be fixed.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the government has failed to take substantial
measures to relieve debt-laden companies while government
officials say it would be impossible to trim their debt-to-equity
ratios below 200 percent by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the corporate debt problem still remains unresolved
even though the country's five largest conglomerates -- Hyundai,
Daewoo, Samsung, Lg and SK -- have agreed to mergers of their
subsidiaries. It will take time to see satisfactory results of the
mergers.
</P>
<P>
Observers warned that current economic situation may be
similar to what was seen last November when the financial crisis
hit the country, so South Korea has no reason and time to be
complacent over its increasing foreign exchange after its usable
foreign exchange reserves hit 44 billion dollars last Month.
</P>
<P>
Some said that Russia's financial turmoil and the yen's
weakness will continue to pose latent threats to the country's
economy.

<HEADLINE> Flood-Hit Areas Witness Rapid Industrial Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The industrial sector of the
flood-stricken provinces in the Yangtze River Valley witnessed an
upsurge this August, according to statistics from the State
Economic and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
In August, the growth rate for industry in east China's Jiangxi
and Anhui provinces increased by 6.2 and 3 percentage points over
July, while those in central China's Hubei and Hunan provinces
rose 4.6 and 1.2 percentage points respectively.
</P>
<P>
The commission attributed the rise of industrial growth rates
to a new demand for medicines, food products and construction
materials which appeared in conjunction with the flood-fighting
activities and home rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
In Hunan Province, for example, the output of Chinese medicines
increased by 33 percent, and steel products by 23 percent last
month, helping to drive local economic development.
</P>
<P>
The floods affected production less in August, as the water
levels were receding by then, which also helped the local
industrial sector grow faster, noted the commission.
</P>
<P>
These provinces kept pace with industrial production in those
areas which were spared any flooding.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the State Statistics Bureau show that in
August, China's industrial incremental output increased by 7.9
percent over the same period last year, and 0.3 percentage points
higher than in July.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets UN Human Rights High Commissioner (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
met with Mary Robinson, United Nations high commissioner for human
rights, here today. They had a friendly talk on international
cooperation for promoting, advancing and safeguarding human rights.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China is a developing country with a population of
1.2 billion. "To develop and protect human rights, we should first
take into account our national conditions. That is to place
economic growth in priority in order to feed and clothe the
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, China places democratic and legal
development in an important position in the process of economic
growth, and the advancement of civil and political rights for
the people through judiciary and executive measures.
</P>
<P>
"China will further expand socialist democracy, improve the
socialist legal system, rule the country according to law,
build up a socialist nation of the rule of law, ensure that the
people enjoy extensive rights and liberty, and respect and
safeguard human rights," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Robinson told Jiang that as the first UN human rights high
commissioner to visit China, she was delighted to tour Beijing,
Tibet and Shanghai, and that she considers her visit "helpful and
valuable."
</P>
<P>
During her journey she witnessed the socio-economic progress
made by China over recent years. "China has scored a tremendous
accomplishment in promoting and protecting the economic, social
and cultural rights of its people," she said. She was also deeply
impressed by the efforts made by China to strengthen legal
construction and carry out legal reform.
</P>
<P>
China, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, is a
responsible country, she noted, adding that her office is willing
to strengthen human rights cooperation with China.

<HEADLINE> China Plans Massive Gas-Development Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- China plans to step up gas
development this year in order to double its gas production
capacity to 30 billion cubic meters by the year 2005 as part of a
major energy-resources development strategy.
</P>
<P>
According to experts with the China National Petroleum Corp
(CNPC), China is expected to verify additional onshore gas
reserves of one trillion cubic meters by the end of the century,
with a cumulative total approaching 2 trillion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
By then, the country's added gas production capacity is
estimated to rise to 10 billion cubic meters, with a cumulative
total topping 25 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
A senior CNPC official forecasts major breakthroughs in the
expansion of proven gas reserves and production capacity in the
Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region, the Tarim Basin and Sichuan
province. The annual gas output should reach 30 billion cubic
meters by 2005, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official said China has huge gas-production potential, and
that through years of vigorous development, three large-scale gas
production areas have taken shape.
</P>
<P>
In the central part of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region, total
gas reserves of 230 billion cubic meters have been verified. Total
gas reserves of 200 billion cubic meters have also been confirmed
in the eastern part of Sichuan, while in the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region total gas reserves of 160 billion cubic meters
have been located, in addition to the discovery of a group of new
gas-bearing geological structures.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in the Sebei area of northwest China's Qinghai
Province, a large gas field with proven reserves of 50 billion
cubic meters has been identified.
</P>
<P>
Along with domestic gas exploration, active efforts are
underway to utilize the gas resources of neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
In central Asia, China has joined an international gas
exploration project planning the construction of a long-distance
gas pipeline running through China and the Korean Peninsula to
Japan. This project could provide China with a gas supply of 25
billion cubic meters a year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a joint venture with Russia for gas exploration in
eastern Siberia should deliver 25 billion cubic meters of gas to
China annually.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, pipelines running across China will take
shape, which will effectively ease shortage in many cities, the
official said.

<P>
During the meeting, Jiang briefed the guests on China's efforts
to combat the severe flooding this summer. In its battle against
the floods, the Chinese government placed the safety of the
people's lives ahead of all else. "We have guaranteed that
residents in the flooded areas have food, clean water, lodging,
and medical services, and that the students in these areas can go
to school," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the loss of life and property was reduced to a
minimum thanks to the efforts made by governments at all levels.
</P>
<P>
The floods of 1931 were much smaller than this year's, but
"they, however, claimed 140,000 lives, which shows a sharply
different historic picture than this year," Jiang said. "It is
also a reflection that only in New China can human rights be
promoted and protected," he added.
</P>
<P>
During China's anti-flood struggle, the international community
gave China tremendous support, Jiang said. A great number of
state and government leaders, international organizations,
enterprises and individuals sent mail and telegrams to the Chinese
government to express their sympathy. They also donated money and
materials for China, showing lofty humanitarianism and deep
friendship to the Chinese people, he said. Their action has
greatly encouraged the strength of the Chinese people and strongly
supported their flood-fighting efforts, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his sincere gratitude and high respect for all
these supporters on behalf of the Chinese government and people.
</P>
<P>
Robinson expressed her sympathy for the losses caused by the
flooding. She said the Chinese people had fought bravely against
the floods under the leadership of President Jiang and the central
government.
</P>
<P>
She went on to say that she appreciates the coherence and
resolve shown by the Chinese people in overcoming difficulties and
calamities. "This is also a reflection of the care of the Chinese
government on human rights," she said, adding that she believes
the Chinese government and people can win a final victory in its
flood-fighting efforts and post-flood reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Jiang also briefed the guests on China's
religious policy and political and economic conditions in the
Tibet Autonomous Region.

<P>
JAKARTA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of students staged a
peaceful rally in front of the House of Representatives here
Monday, urging the government to reduce the prices of staple food.
</P>
<P>
"Prices (of commodities) continue to soar and there is no
indication that they will decrease soon," head of the Student
Movement of the Indonesian Muslim Preaching Academy Jamaluddin
Effendi said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read by Effendi, the group demanded that the
House urge the government to settle the misuse of funds as well as
bring to justice staple food "jockeys" who have made the people
suffer.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators dispersed at noon, and traffic continued to
flow as usual despite the rally.
</P>
<P>
Last week, students in Jakarta, Surabaya, Semarang, Bandung and
other cities held rallies to protest the spiraling prices of the
basic commodities. They urged President B. J. Habibie to take
concrete measures to solve the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Over the past couple of weeks, rice prices have sharply
increased to about 5,000 rupiah (0.45 U.S. dollar) per kilogram,

rupiah per kilogram.

<HEADLINE> DRC Rebels Should Be Included in Peace Talks: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 14 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Minister Alfread Nzo said Monday that peace efforts in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) would have to involve the
rebels who were trying to overthrow the government of President
Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Nzo made the remarks in the northern Mauritius resort of Grand
Baie, where the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
started its annual summit on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no other way. I don't think it is going to help
to insist there is no rebel movement," South African Press
Association quoted Nzo as saying.
</P>
<P>
The DRC is insisting the uprising in the country is almost
solely the work of Rwandan and Ugandan forces and that the rebels
be excluded from any cease-fire negotiations.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela, who is chairing the
SADC summit, told reporters that Rwandan and Ugandan delegations
had arrived in Mauritius and would be invited to join the summit
session dealing with the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Both Rwanda and Uganda are not member states of the 14-member
of the SADC.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Shilling Slides Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Shilling continues to
depreciate against the U.S. Dollar even after the intervention of the
Bank of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
It slid to a record low of between 1,290 to 1,305 shillings per
Dollar over the weekend, the New Vision paper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five months, the Shilling has substantially faY95RkV,k$]4e Doll
ar with selling quotations hiking from 1,160
Shillings in February to 1,260 Shillings in July. It plummeted to
over 1,300 Shillings per Dollar as the situation is getting out of
control, one dealer was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sharp fall of Shilling is blamed on the decrease of coffee
exports and the intensified warfare in neighboring Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The value of coffee exported in the last 11 months has dropped to
258.4 million Dollars from 336.5 million Dollars for the same period
during the 1996/1997 coffee season.
</P>
<P>
This 1997/1998 coffee season, which is coming to an end, worsens the
situation because upcountry coffee growers prefer holding stock to
banking the money. This also contributes to the fall of coffee
exports which account for 55 to 60 percent of the country's
foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the war in DRC also leads to the weakening of the
Ugandan currency. The intensification of the war has scared tourists
away and investors are yanking more Dollars out of the region for
security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Ulrike Wilson, the outgoing resident representative of the
International Monetary Fund, however, holds a different view, saying
that the exchange rates are changing worldwide because of crises in
Russia, Latin America and Asia.
</P>
<P>
This is a global trend and should not be considered regionally,
he added.

KAMPALA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Uganda will postpone
the release of a 20,000 shilling note to next year due to
security considerations.
</P>
<P>
The bank wants the new note to possess special security
features against forgery, an official with the financial
institution was quoted by the East African weekly as saying
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Counterfeit notes of 10,000- and 5,000-shilling denominations
have been found in circulation and therefore the new note will be
released with greatest care, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the Secretary to the Treasury Tumusiime Mutebile said
he ordered the central bank to introduce a 20,000 shilling note
as a matter of urgency. The government was also considering
introducing 50,000 shilling notes, he added.
</P>
<P>
Radio Uganda launched a special program to warn people about
the counterfeit notes because many fake notes have been found in
circulation.
</P>
<P>
Several people illegally operating money-making machines have
so far been arrested, the report said.

<HEADLINE> S. African Export Insurance Firm Blacklists Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 14 (Xinhua) -- South African exporters to
Kenya will have to pay higher premium for credit insurance as
Kenya is now regarded as a high risk destination.
</P>
<P>
With a high risk rating, Kenya can expect goods from South
Africa to either cost more or reduce in volume, local analysts
warned Monday.
</P>
<P>
The decision to charge higher premiums was announced last week
by the South Africa-based Credit Guarantee Insurance Corporation
of Africa, citing Kenya's poor economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
The move has drawn criticism from Kenya's Export Promotion
Council, which last month held an one-week "Kenya in South
Africa" trade exhibition in Johannesburg, the East African, a
regional weekly newspaper, reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The deputy director of the council, Zachary Gichohi, said the
move smacked of "business politics" and was not based on present
economic realities.
</P>
<P>
However, Credit Insurance Corporation, a South African export
insurance company, which insures payments for goods exported to
Kenya by South African companies, now also ranks Kenya as a
high-risk destination for goods.
</P>
<P>
Credit guarantee insurance enables exporters to claim
compensation from an insurer if exported goods are not paid for
by the importer. Premiums depend on the perception of risk in the
importing country.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has grown steadily over the past five years to
become Kenya's leading investor from Africa. The value of its
exports to Kenya, including household utilities, textiles,
foodstuff, wines and beer, has trebled to 20 billion Shillings
(333 million U.S. Dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is also South Africa's biggest trading partner in
sub-Saharan Africa outside the 14-member Southern African
Development Community. Its exports to South Africa stand at 1.2
billion Shillings ( 20 million Dollars), comprising mainly tea,
horticultural produce and soda ash.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan exporters have complained for years about stiff tariff
and non-tariff barriers set up by South Africa to Kenya. A series
of negotiations over how to remove these barriers have been held
between the two governments since last year.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Mbeya Region Aims at Expanding Coffee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Mbeya Region, a major
coffee producer in Tanzania, has come up with an ambitious plan to
drastically increase its output of the cash crop.
</P>
<P>
The region plans to plant 2.5 million coffee seedlings in
1998/99 season, compared with 425,000 last season and 63,000 in 1995,
and raise the output of a tree from quarter of a kilogram to between
one and two kilograms, Daily News reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Strategies laid to attain the goal include distribution of
quality seedlings, proper nursing of trees and enhancing extended
services, the local paper quoted the Regional Commissioner Basil
Pesambili Mramba as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We want our people here to consider coffee as their main survival
crop," he said, adding that farmers used to regard maize as the
mainstay cash crop.
</P>
<P>
The regional commissioner has also acknowledged problems in the
coffee industry, such as the violation of purchasing regulations by
private buyers and the decline in coffee quality.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's coffee is mainly produced in Arusha and Kilimanjaro
regions in the north and Mbeya in the southwest. Coffee export
earnings during 1995-1997 totaled 120 million U.S. Dollars and
accounted for 15 percent of all commodity exports, statistics
indicated.
</P>
<P>
The output and quality of coffee, however, have both declined in
recent years due to aging trees, lack of farmer education, low use of
fertilizer, poor processing and high labor input, said Leslie Omari,
managing director of state-run Tanzanian Coffee Board.
</P>
<P>
At an annual coffee industry conference in Arusha, President
Benjamin Mkapa challenged the country's coffee growers to double
production within five years, promising full government support for
efforts to reverse successive years of declining yields.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Tourism Set to Pick up After Bad Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's tourism industry,
the country's top foreign exchange earner, is on the road to
recovery after a slump last year.
</P>
<P>
The averaged hotel occupancy rate at the Coast, where receives
more than 70 percent of visitors annually, rose to estimated 45
percent last month from 37 percent in July and 24 percent in
June, the East African reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The (tourism) industry is on the path to recovery," Edgar
Francula, the regional manager of the Touristic Union
International (TUI) which is a leading tour operator in Europe,
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said forecasts for tourism in the winter season, which
begins in November, appear very promising.
</P>
<P>
Charter flights to Kenya were expected to double by November
when bookings were also expected to double, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
The advertizing campaign by the Kenya Tourism Board (KTB) in
Europe appeared to be paying off.
</P>
<P>
KTB Chairman Eliud Mahihu said the board placed advertisements
in 35 travel magazines with a readership of over 45 million in
Europe only last month.
</P>
<P>
Tourism nearly came to a standstill last year following the
August eruption of tribal clashes in Mombasa, the capital city of
the Coast Province. About 60,000 hotel workers were laid off
during the slump.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Urges Agricultural Cooperaton with Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Jordanian Minister of
Agriculture Moghem al-Kharaisha has called on Jordanian and
Lebanese agricultural sectors to profit from each other and not
compete, the Daily Star reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kharaisha was here to attend the 12th summit of the executive
committee of the Arab Organization for Agricultural Development
which opened on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the two-day conference, he said that Lebanese
and Jordanian agriculture sectors should complement each other.
</P>
<P>
"We have different timetables of production in agriculture and
grow different varieties of fruits and vegetables. We therefore
should find no difficulties in trading with each other," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan imports 30,000 tons of Lebanese food while Lebanon
imports 51,000 tons of food from Jordan each year.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian minister downplayed the border incident last
month when more than 1,000 tons of Lebanese potatoes were stopped
at the Jordanian border for Jordanian officials claimed they fell
below quality standards.
</P>
<P>
But Lebanese farmers believe the Jordanian action was in
response to Lebanon's refusal to accept its watermelons in May.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have signed an agreement to exchange
Jordanian fruits and vegetables for Lebanon's potatoes early this
year.
</P>
<P>
Kharaisha blamed the two incidents on traders from both
countries, saying they did not respect agricultural calendar nor
the quantities and quality set by the two governments.
</P>
<P>
He called on the agricultural sectors in both countries to
further boost cooperation and trade.

<HEADLINE> 2000 Games Plans on Target, Says Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Australia Tuesday rolls
into the final two years of preparations for the 2000 Sydney
Olympic Games with the construction of venues on target.
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony for the Games is scheduled for September
15, 2000, but officials admitted to some nerves as the great
event draws near.
</P>
<P>
"I hesitate to say we're positioned well because as soon as
you start thinking you're on top of this, you'll stuff it up for
sure," Michael Knight, the Olympics Minister and president of the
Sydney Games organising committee (SOCOG) was quoted as saying in
Monday's Sydney Morning Herald newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Games organisers last month released ticketing details, with
more than 9.6 million tickets available and prices ranging from
as little to A$10 (6 U.S. dollars) up to A$1,382 for premium
seats at the opening and closing ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
Tickets will go on sale by random ballot in mid-1999.
</P>
<P>
Most of the other big issues for organisers, such as stadium
construction, accommodation and sponsorship, are reported to be
under control.
</P>
<P>
A number of venues for the Games have already been completed,
while all but two -- tennis and a second water polo centre -- are
under construction.
</P>
<P>
The last venue is expected to be completed in early 2000, the
Herald said.
</P>
<P>
The key works still under construction include the main
stadium at Homebush Bay, scheduled to open next March.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's imports during
the first two months of the current fiscal year (July 1-June 30 )
declined by 17.21 percent when compared with the same period of
last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
According to the provisional figures released Monday by the
Federal Bureau of Statistics, the imports decrease is mainly due
to decline in the import of food items and petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
The figures show that the imports in July and August amounted
to 1.402 billion U.S. dollars as against 1.694 billion dollars in
the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the petroleum group is 46.68 percent and that in
the food group is 38.36 percent. Meanwhile, the import in the
machinery group also recorded a decline of 18.68 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the imports in the agricultural and other chemical
group registered an increase of 20.58 percent when compared with
the corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
There was a major decline in the import of petroleum products
which recorded 123.26 million dollars in the first two months of
the current fiscal year while the import of petroleum products in
the same period of last fiscal year was 231 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The upward movement in imports of agricultural group was mainly
due to the increase in the fertilizer import which amounted to
11.31 million dollars in July and August as against 200,000
dollars in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit in the first two months of this year is 308
million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Passes 1999 State Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Following days of
wrangling, Israeli cabinet on Sunday night passed with a majority
state budget for 1999 featuring overall spending cut but defense
outlays rise.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen of the 17 ministers voted in favor of the budget
proposal, two were against and one abstained, Radio reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
This marked another success for Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, who had persuaded his cabinet to approve the budget
proposal prepared by Finance Minister Ya'akov Neeman.
</P>
<P>
The review of the 1999 budget proposal, which plans a overall
cut and an increase in defense spending for the first time in 10
years, began last week, with 11 ministers being reported to have
opposed the program at the time.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Neeman met with budget opponents over the past
week and managed to piece together a larger-than-expected majority
for the plan.
</P>
<P>
The two said at a news conference after the vote that the
majority was attained by redistributing budget cuts among the
various ministries, and that overall spending will not be higher
than planned.
</P>
<P>
The defense budget, the core of the contention, obtained an
increase of 100 million shekels (about 26 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said defense spending did not rise as much as he
would like, but "it heralds a multi-year increase in
strategic-defense spending."
</P>
<P>
The government has agreed on a 10-year plan meant to increase
defense spending incrementally, he added.
</P>
<P>
Most of the defense budget increase will be used to buy arms,
including jet fighters and combat helicopters.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Nets 11.6 Million Dollars From Tax Evaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A crackdown on tax evaders
in Kenya's construction industry has netted the east African
country 700 million Shillings (11.6 million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Income Tax Department is also expected to raise about 1.5
billion Shillings (25 million Dollars) from 20 large contractors
and 50 firms, which have long evaded the tax man, the East African
weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The tax audit by the Kenya Revenue Authority revealed that the
32 companies it examined, which included a foreign firm that has
been in Kenya for more than 10 years, have recorded losses every
year.
</P>
<P>
The result alerted the tax authorities to the possibility of
major loopholes that the construction industry, with more than 30
billion Shillings (50 million Dollars) of turnover a year, is used
to avoid paying taxes.
</P>
<P>
Another audit carried out on 38 professional firms revealed
that about 60 percent of them had no files at the Income Tax
Department. Another 25 percent had files but either failed to
file returns or did not provide complete information.
</P>
<P>
Only about 15 percent fully satisfied the conditions set by
the local Income Tax Department, the weekly said.

of New Zealand wines in Britain is very high. The institute has
set up an office there to market the products of New Zealand's
wine industry.
</P>
<P>
An indicator of the value put on New Zealand wines in Britain
was that the average price was 17.13 NZ dollars, higher than the
price of an average-priced bottle from Australia, the United
States, France and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to the annual report, more growth in New Zealand's
wine industry is expected. The country recently has 7,943 hectares
of grape vineyards, and that figure is expected to increase to
8,716 hectares by 2000.

<HEADLINE> AL Proposes Libyan-Dutch Accord on Lockerbie Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League chief Esmat
Abdel Meguid has proposed that Libya and the Netherlands sign a
pre-trial agreement spelling out details surrounding the
prosecution of the Libyan suspects in the Lockerbie bombing.
</P>
<P>
Libya has rejected a new U.S.-British decision to accept the
trial in the Hague before Scottish judges, citing it did not
ensure the safety of the accused during transit and after the
trial should they be convicted.
</P>
<P>
Two Libyans were accused of blowing up a Pan Am plane in 1988
over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people. The U.S. and Britain
had been demanding extradition of the Libyans to either of them,
but lately changed their mind in order to get a speedy trial.
</P>
<P>
They insisted that their offer is unnegotiatable. But the Arabs
are more sympathetic to the Libyan stand at procedural detailed
should be worked out before the suspected are handed over for
trial.
</P>
<P>
"The Libyan and Dutch governments should sign an agreement to
clarify all the issues pending in the Lockerbie case and in which
the suspects will stand trial in the Hague under Scottish law,"
said Abdel Meguid, quoted by Egyptian Gazette Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The proposal will be a tool aimed at pushing things forward
concerning Lockerbie," he said following separate meetings with
the British Ambassador to Egypt David Blatherwick, and the Libyan
delegate to the AL, Salma Rashed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed last week his support for Libya's request for
"guarantees" on the fate of the men.
</P>
<P>
In a separate development Sunday, Libya decided to disband its
Ministry of Promoting Arab Unity in the coming few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East News Agency quoted informed Libyan sources as
explaining the decision as in line with Libya's increasing
assertion of its African affiliation.
</P>
<P>
Local observers believe that Libya is taking the step to
protest Arab failure to have the seven-year-old United Nations
embargo against the Afro-Arab country lifted.
</P>
<P>
In a recent TV interview, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi has
rapped Arab countries for not showing strong enough support to
Libya, while praising the Organization of African Unity for
backing its demand for lifting the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed air, arms and diplomatic embargo on the
country in 1992 after Libya failed to hand over the two suspects
in the Lockerbie bombing.
</P>
<P>
Arab foreign ministers are to meet here Wednesday to study the
new developments of the Lockerbie issue.

<HEADLINE> Water-borne Diseases Spreading in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Diarrhea and other water-borne
diseases are spreading fast among the flood-affected people
throughout Bangladesh as flood waters are receding, a major
English newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 209,981 people have been attacked by diarrheal
diseases in 47 flood-hit districts since July 15, and 174 of them
died, The Independent daily quoted an official in charge of the
central control room of the Health Directorate as saying.
</P>
<P>
Over 4,000 medical teams with 1,998 doctors are working in the
flood-affected areas to treat patients and control the spread of
diseases. In addition to hundreds of existing health centers, 80
temporary treatment camps have also been set up in the vulnerable
areas, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The public health departments are also providing the flood
victims with water purifying tablets, oral saline packets,
tetracycline capsules, intravenous fluid, and other emergency
medicine for common diseases.
</P>
<P>
Besides diarrheal diseases, other diseases like acute
respiratory track infection, pneumonia, dysentery, abdominal pain,
scabies, conjunctivitis and jaundice are also spreading quickly
among the flood victims.
</P>
<P>
Children are falling prey to various ailments due to a lack of
pure drinking water, inadequate food and a lack of proper hygienic
conditions in the relief centers.
</P>
<P>
About 37,000 diarrheal patients were treated at the hospital
attached to the International Center for Diarrheal Diseases and
Research in Bangladesh since July 18 when the hospital began to
experience the pressure of the patients, according to the center.
</P>
<P>
The center, which used to treat 200 to 250 patients a day on
average, is now attending 600 to 700 patients daily.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing deluge which began to hit Bangladesh in early July
has so far hit two-thirds of the country's territory and left
about 900 people dead and millions of others homeless.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Tighten Control on Guest Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Fayez
Tarawneh has pledged to tighten control over the 350,000 foreign
workers in Jordan, mainly Egyptians, Iraqis and Syrians, the
Jordan Times newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister promised to look into all means of
controlling the local labor market and preventing foreigners from
working illegally at the expense of Jordanians, the paper quoted a
government source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh stressed the need to reduce the number of foreign
laborers in Jordan who work mainly in agriculture and
construction sectors, but he steered away from saying how he
would achieve this politically sensitive goal.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Minister of Labor Mohammad Mahdi Farhan
told the press that the ministry was considering to add new jobs
to a list of occupations that non-Jordanians are not allowed to
take as well as to decrease the number of work permits issued to
guest workers in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
By these measures, the ministry intended to make vacancy and
help unemployed Jordanians get jobs.
</P>
<P>
Current regulations bar guest workers from filling 15 kinds of
positions, which include jobs in accountancy, teaching and office
work. Official figures showed that only 50,000 out of the 350,000
foreign laborers have valid work permits.
</P>
<P>
Non-Jordanians, whether with or without work permits, are easy
to be hired in comparison with Jordanians, because employers can
give them lower wages and do not have to pay for their health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
Independent sources placed the current number of unemployed
Jordanians at about 1.2 million, or 26 percent of its 4.6 million
population.

<HEADLINE> Girl-Trafficking Gang Leader Arrested in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Nepali police have arrested
a gang leader involved in girl-trafficking in different parts of
the country, The Kathmandu Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Krishna Pariyar, 27, was arrested along with his 17-year-old
brother Bishnu Pariyar after a girl, sold by them to Bombay, India
was rescued, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Krishna Pariyar, a native Nepali, had confessed that his gang
had sold 12 girls to a brothel in Bombay. He also said he had been
engaged in girl-trafficking for the past six years with his
offices in different parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that about 5,000 to 7,000 Nepalese women and
girls are trafficked every year through the 1,750-kilometer-long
open Indo-Nepal border.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 200,000 Nepalese women and children who have been
trafficked to India are forced into prostitution, the State of the
Rights of the Child in Nepal 1998 said.
</P>
<P>
A survey found that poverty, unemployment and ignorance are the
major factors contributing to the commercial sexual exploitation
of women and children in Nepal.

<HEADLINE> Thai Agriculture Bank Asked to Raise Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has suggested
Thailand's Bank of Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives
(BAAC) raise interest rates in order to reflect the cost of
funding, the Nation newspaper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Ennoo Seusawan, executive vice-president of the BAAC,
the newspaper said the move also aims to avoid market distortion.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate hike recommendation came after
representatives of the World Bank recently completed a BAAC
performance review.
</P>
<P>
To comply with lending discipline, the BAAC will raise interest
rates on selected lending portfolios to market rates, Ennoo said.
</P>
<P>
However, the BAAC will maintain low interest rates on farmers'
or small agricultural cooperatives' loans in order to keep their
interest burdens at a minimum, he added.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the average BAAC interest rate is 11.5 percent on
loans up to 60,000 baht (1,500 U.S. dollars). On loans worth more
than 60,000 baht, the bank will charge between 12.5 and 17
percent.
</P>
<P>
According to Ennoo, the World Bank also suggested the BAAC
improve loan-loss reserves by shortening the bank-reserve
requirement period for bad debts.
</P>
<P>
The BAAC will cut 10-year full reserves to five years in order
to strengthen its accounting practices, he said.
</P>
<P>
To increase its lending, the BAAC will recapitalize up to 20
billion baht (500 million dollars) from the current 9.6 billion
baht (240 million dollars) within the year.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Government to Start Austerity Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina has approved a circular on an austerity drive, the
Independent daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The austerity drive aims to cut down non-essential expenditure
in all government offices and divert the funds for relief and
post-flood reconstruction, the newspaper said. The Finance
Ministry will issue the circular soon.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Hasina minister called for observing austerity
nation-wide, including in public and private offices, to deal with
the problems arising out of the two-month-long flooding.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister S.A.M.S. Kibria said the money saved would be
used for the gigantic task of rehabilitation in the flooding
areas.
</P>
<P>
Under the austerity plan, he said, extravagant spending on
luxury affairs would be discouraged.
</P>
<P>
Contingency funds of all ministries would be cut down, use of
fuel for office transports and foreign travels by ministers and
bureaucrats would be curtailed, he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister herself canceled a plan to attend the
Non-Aligned Movement summit in South Africa early this month, and
her trips to Malaysia, Brunei and Vietnam scheduled for early next
month were also canceled.
</P>
<P>
There are many ways to avoid wasteful expenditure, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The current floods have hit two-thirds of the country's total
area, affecting about 30 million people in 47 of the 64 districts,
and the death toll has risen to nearly 900.

WASHINGTON -- The Asian financial crisis that appeared in July
1997 in Thailand and its subsequent global reverberations,
dominanted the IMF's work in 1997/98, and also prompted a record
level of IMF lending in the year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Annual Report 1998 released here Sunday by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), member countries drew some 25.6
billion U.S. dollars from the IMF's General Resources Account in
the credit tranches in the year of 1997/98, ended on April 30,
1998, nearly four times the level of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the IMF approved 9 new Stand-By Arrangements, with
total commitments of 27.3 billion Special Drawing Rights (SDR),
which is equivalent to some 27.3 billion dollars (As of April 30,
SDR 1 is equal to 1.34666 dollars). Besides, there were 4 new
Extended Arrangements, with total commitments of SDR 2.8 billion,
which is about 3.77 billion dollars. (IMF-Annual-Report)

<HEADLINE> One Percent of Indians Infected With HIV: Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 14 (Xinhua) -- One out of every 100
persons in India is infected with HIV which causes AIDS, according
to recent countrywide official surveys.
</P>
<P>
A senior official at the Health Ministry, requesting anonymity,
said the situation in the country was serious. "Several
top-ranking people are seeking help for their relatives. But no
one wants to come forward and say that AIDS is affecting our near
and dear ones."
</P>
<P>
Prasada Rao, a project director of the National AIDS Program,
said: "The infection rate has touched one percent. Beyond this,
the spread is extremely fast."
</P>
<P>
If the spread was not arrested at this stage, it might result
in an Africa-like situation, where young earning members of
households were wiped off by the virus, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, the Indian government initiated a program in a
bid to arrest the spread of the AIDS virus, and the National AIDS
Control Program was launched in April 1987.
</P>
<P>
A separate wing, called the National AIDS Control Organization,
was set up soon after. It received a soft loan of 84 million U.S.
dollars from the World Bank for the period of 1992-97.
</P>
<P>
Since then, however, cases of HIV infection have grown rapidly,
with the virus penetrating the general population gradually. It
first entered the high-risk segments such as sex-workers and
intra-venous drug-users.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Russian Crisis Moderately Hits Kazak Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Russia's financial crisis
that has shaken the world market has moderately hit
Kazakhstan. Inflation in the Central Asian country is estimated to
be 6 to 7 percent, low enough to keep its economy going.
</P>
<P>
Still closely linked to the Russian market, Kazakhstan sells
one third of its exports to Russia. But its currency, tenge,
devalued only 3.94 percent in the first eight months of 1998 as
the Russian ruble depreciated 200 percent in one month.
</P>
<P>
A strong financial system helps the country avoid a
Russian-style crisis, said Alievich Dzhandosov, chairman of the
National Bank of Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
He said Kazakhstan has built a financial structure independent
of the Russian system, which was further improved with reforms in
recent years. Now the country's foreign exchange reserves stand at
two billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the Russian crisis does affect the Kazak economy
moderately. Since the end of August, Russians thronged into
Kazakhstan to use rubles to buy tenges at extremely low prices,
and then resold tenges for U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the value of the tenge started to slip, and the
rate between it and the dollar touched 100 to one in the worst
days.
</P>
<P>
Along with the depreciation of the currency, commodities prices
began soaring, with sugar, rice and other daily necessities up by
almost 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
In fear of further price hikes, poor people started to buy
foods in panic while the rich bought the dollar and the Deutsch
mark.
</P>
<P>
In Alma-Ata, banks as well as peddlers in these days rushed for
dollars, sending its rate to one against 90 tenge, an increase of
15 percent. Meanwhile, prices in Alma-Ata were raised by a flat 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
To control the situation, the Kazak government and the central
bank have demanded all commercial banks to stop speculation on the
currency market, and also set a ceiling of one dollar to 85 tenges.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government adopted emergency measures to slash
budget spending by 60 billion tenges.
</P>
<P>
All these efforts have helped stablize the financial
situation. Dzhandosov, the central banker, said confidently that
the Russian crisis does strike Kazakhstan, but not with much
effect.

<HEADLINE> Scholarships Fail to Help Thai Children Stay at School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A free scholarship program
launched by the Thai government has failed to keep economic
crisis-affected children at school, the Bangkok Post reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kanuengnit Klinmuang, a counselor with the Islamic College of
Thailand in Bangkok, said at least 15 students at the college had
dropped out this term and more were likely to follow.
</P>
<P>
The counselor, who is responsible for the school's
scholarships, said the school badly needed funds since needy
students now had only 200,000 baht (5,000 U.S. dollars) in
donation to help them.
</P>
<P>
The scholarship program was approved by the cabinet in June,
about one month after the first term began. It is funded by a one
billion-baht (25 million dollars) loan from the Asian Development
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, a primary school student should get 4,000
baht (100 dollars) and a lower secondary school student 5,000 bath
(125 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Some school administrators say the program is likely to fail
because it has come too late. Those children who have left schools
are unlikely to return since they don't want to catch up on
classes missed. The program only covers one year of education.
</P>
<P>
So far, there have been an estimated 200,000 dropouts
nationwide, according to the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Stolen Passports of Nepali Delegation Found in SAfrica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 14 (Xinhua) -- All the 21 diplomatic
passports including that of Nepali Prime Minister Girija Prasad
Koirala which were stolen early this month in South Africa have
been found and are on their way to Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
The South African government had informed the Nepali Foreign
Ministry about the recovery of the passports lost at the Durban
International Airport of South Africa, a Nepali journalist said
Monday. His passport was stolen as well.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali delegation found the bag containing the passports
stolen when it was leaving Durban for Johannesburg on September 4
after attending the 12th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement held
on September 2-3, said the journalist who accompanied the
delegation.
</P>
<P>
He said that on the advice of the South African Foreign
Ministry, Nepali Foreign Ministry officials in the delegation
wrote letters of certificate to serve as provisional passports.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of passports, the delegation could not exchange
its traveler's checks in Johannesburg and Dubai, the United Arab
Emirates.
</P>
<P>
But the Qatar government made all the arrangements when the
Nepali delegation arrived on September 5-8 for an official visit.
</P>
<P>
The delegation returned home on September 8 without passports.

<HEADLINE> Czech Republic Faces Serious Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, September 13 (Xinhua) -- "Unemployment, like a time
bomb, is exploding in the Czech Republic," claimed Czech Prime
Minister Milos Zeman recently.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment in August this year reached 320,000, a record of
6.4 percent since the country started reforms towards a market
economy in 1990.
</P>
<P>
In some northern parts, the rate rose to as high as 14
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, local economists expect unemployment to continue
increasing in the near future, and expect a rate of 7 percent by
the end of the year, 8.4 percent next year and more than 10
percent by year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Of the eastern European countries, the Czech Republic was once
considered a great success in the economic transition with low
unemployment as well as constant development.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, unemployment rate was only 2.9 percent, one of the
lowest in the world, until the recent serious economic slide
boosted it up.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of Czech's gross national product (GDP) in the
same year reached 6.4 percent. But, it began to slow down as the
government relaxed its macro-control of the economy and put too
much premium on the role of the market itself.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the country saw a GDP growth of only one percent, and
in the first half of this year, a minus 1.8 percent. Estimation
said the country may record a zero growth of economy this year.
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstance, the government was forced to cut down
expenses while many enterprises had to make large numbers of
layoffs, adding to an already rising unemployment figure.
</P>
<P>
Feeling the pain, the Czech government has not worked out
effective measures yet, but Zeman said, it would reform its
employment policy, reduce the taxation on small and medium-sized
enterprises, and encourage foreign investment in the country.

<HEADLINE> Air Canada Set to Take off Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Air Canada passengers could
take flight as soon as Monday, provided the airline's pilots vote
this weekend to ratify the deal that brought an end to the
nine-day strike.
</P>
<P>
"There may be a few flights on Monday," Air Canada spokesman
John Hamilton was quoted as saying by the local media Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But while Hamilton said international flights may take a few
more days than domestic ones to get back on course, it should be
business as usual for all services by Thursday or Friday.
</P>
<P>
Air Canada mechanics were called back to the job Friday,
Hamilton said, making necessary preparations for services to
resume.
</P>
<P>
Air Canada pilots went on strike on September 2. The pilots
are seeking a 12-percent raise spread over two years to their
current average salary of 100,000 Canadian dollars (57,000 U.S.
dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
The company's latest offer was a boost of nine percent over two
years. Air Canada and its 2,100 striking pilots reached an
agreement in principle late Thursday to end the nine-day strike.
</P>
<P>
But Hamilton refused to comment on reports that pilots will get
a 9 percent wage increase over two years. "We agreed with the
union that we wouldn't release it publically until the
ratification is announced Monday," Hamilton said.

<HEADLINE> 17 Million Families Face Food Shortages in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian State Minister of
Food and Horticulture A.M. Saefuddin acknowledged that 17 million
families are facing food shortages in the country, the Jakarta
Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with the newspaper, Saefuddin said
that in Central and East Java provinces, 60 percent of 7.3 million
poor families (a household averages four people) could afford only
one meal a day.
</P>
<P>
He described it as a "critical situation."
</P>
<P>
The other 9.7 million families were considered to be able to
eat twice daily, but this ability was declining fast, he said.
</P>
<P>
Saefuddin identified areas particularly vulnerable to food
crisis and social unrest as including North and West Jakarta
mayoralties, and Tangerang and Bekasi in Greater Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
"Urban poor are especially vulnerable. In many rural areas,
people are more used to hardship and can seek alternative ways to
cope. Those who demonstrate or loot are usually the urban poor,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The government was prescribing special measures for
poverty-stricken areas vulnerable to social unrest, the minister
added.
</P>
<P>
Last week, students stepped up protests against the government
for failure to control the rising prices of essential commodities.
</P>
<P>
"Prices tend to rise, while domestic stocks of rice decline,"
Saefuddin said, adding that government stocks had thinned to 2
million tons because of continued market operations.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to flood markets with the stocks in hopes
of controlling the prices, he said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested an alternative plan to allow the private sector to
import rice directly rather than through the State Logistics
Agency (Bulog).
</P>
<P>
He also suggested the abolition of import taxes and duties,
pointing to the relatively small international stocks of rice,
currently controlled by China, Thailand, Vietnam, India, Pakistan
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Private imports will bolster international prices, and
influence domestic prices as well. Therefore, government subsidies
on rice must be maintained," he added.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Buddhist University to Open in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- An international Buddhist
missionary university, the first one in Myanmar to teach Theravada
(Little Vehicle) Buddhism in various languages, will open here in
December this year, according to official religion sources.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the International Theravada Buddhist
Missionary University (ITBMU) is aimed at sharing the genuine
Theravada Buddhism with followers in the world, and studying and
comprehending the canonical texts of the Buddhism which eventually
lead to the purification, perpetuation and propagation of the
Buddha teachings in the world.
</P>
<P>
The university will begin with a one-year diploma course with
different language teachings covering English, Chinese, French,
Japanese, German, Hindu and Arabic. The medium of instruction will
be in English.
</P>
<P>
The subjects to be taught in the university cover theory and
practice of Buddhism, Buddhist culture, history, comparative
studies of religions, Pali and Myanmar languages.
</P>
<P>
Foreign monks, nuns and laypersons, who have passed the
matriculation standard, are allowed to join the university, or
they will have to sit for entrance examinations.
</P>
<P>
Those who complete the initial one-year diploma course are
allowed for further studies for Bachelor, Master and Doctor
degrees of Philosophy in Buddha teaching.
</P>
<P>
A country with a majority of its population (about 89.4
percent) believing in Buddhism, Myanmar had established Buddhist
scripture learning centers and other monastic education schools
long ago.
</P>
<P>
There are two state Buddhist universities in the country, one
in Yangon and the other in Mandalay.
</P>
<P>
For nearly a thousand years, Myanmar has kept Theravada
Buddhism pure and intact.

Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
 "People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji has said the reconstruction of
flooded areas on the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River
should be geared to the aim of eliminating future flood threats.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist party of China Central Committee, made the
statement during a tour of Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan and Sichuan
provinces and Chongqing municipality, areas that were hit by
devastating floods this summer.
</P>
<P>
"The most urgent tasks right now are to make sure that the
people displaced by the floods can survive the winter and to
combine the reconstruction of the flood-hit areas with work to
guard against and prevent future floods," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
-- A commentary frontpaged the daily calling for nationwide
speaking of standard Chinese language.
</P>
<P>
"Xinhua Daily Telegraph"
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing called for greater efforts

epidemics in the flood-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
During an inspection tour of northeast China's Heilongjiang and
Jilin provinces and northern China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous

must be done of rebuilding primary and middle schools destroyed by
floods.

<HEADLINE> Harassment Stalks People Working With Rape Victims in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian volunteers working
with victims of rape, especially from the May riots, said they are
still facing terror targeted at them and their families, the
Jakarta Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The targets have included gynecologists, according to Sandyawan
Sumardi and Karlina Leksono-Supelli of the Volunteers for
Humanity.
</P>
<P>
Sandyawan, a priest who runs the Jakarta Social Institute
working for the urban poor, cited how a doctor who had just
testified before the government-sponsored Joint Fact-Finding Team
received a call telling him to "stop meddling."
</P>
<P>
The caller told the doctor that "they" knew where his
daughters' school was and that they would be raped unless he
stopped testifying.
</P>
<P>
"The doctor then said he had to give up, which we understood
and respected," Sandyawan told the Jakarta Post.
</P>
<P>
Karlina said one of the callers she answered said: "So you guys
still want to continue (investigating the rape cases). Aren't you
afraid of being raped?"
</P>
<P>
Karlina said the terror began soon after the "breaking of the
silence" on the rapes during the May riots.
</P>
<P>
In July the Volunteers for Humanity reported to the National
Commission on Human Rights that they had received 168 reports of
rape, 152 of them in Jakarta and the rest in other cities
including Surakarta and Surabaya, in Central and East Java
respectively. The victims of the rapes were mostly ethnic Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"The gap between the demands for evidence" and the condition of
traumatized victims, and also continued terror and denials has
been a major hindrance in the progress to solving the crimes,
Karlina said.
</P>
<P>
"A victim who had agreed to a medical check-up changed her mind
in the doctor's room," she was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The only victim who courageously appeared in a closed session
last month at a United Nations sub-commission with Karlina and
Sandyawan did not return home given the terror targeted at her
family's home, Karlina said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from terror, there were repeated denials by government
officials of the rapes, Karlina said.
</P>
<P>
The terror against volunteers and also families of rape victims
reflects a "strong force" that wants the cases to remain unsolved,
said Karlina, who is a founder of the Concerned Mothers' Voice
group.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia saw the worst looting and rioting in decades in
Jakarta and other cities from May 13 to 15. About 1,200 people
died, and thousands of buildings and vehicles were damaged or
burnt during the riots.

<HEADLINE> Manila, IMF Agree on "Flexible" Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has reached
agreement that the country will maintain a "flexible" interest
rate policy to ward off any speculative attacks against its
currency.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was contained in the final draft of a new
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies reached recently
between the Philippines and the IMF, the Today newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under the memorandum, the central bank will continue to use
interest rates as tool to address any pressure on the Philippine
peso.
</P>
<P>
This means interest rates will be kept at high levels when the
currency is under speculative attacks as seen last week at the
Philippine Dealing System, the country's electronic currency spot
market.
</P>
<P>
The IMF, however, will not support any move by the central bank
to intervene in the currency market, whether directly or
indirectly.
</P>
<P>
The draft says that foreign exchange must remain
market-determined, a clear statement of policy from the IMF that
foreign exchange controls similar to what Malaysia has adopted
should never be applied by the Philippine government.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson was quoted as saying
earlier that the central bank had no plans to bring down further
its overnight interest rates to "normal" levels of 13 percent for
borrowing and 15 percent for lending.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Middlesbrough Beats Tottenham Spurs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Two first half goals from
Colombian international Hamilton Ricard and a late one from
Vladimir Kinder helped Middlesbrough beat Tottenham Hotspurs at
the English Premier League on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The victory was also a nice return for Paul Gascoigne, who has
been dropped from Glenn Hoddle's English team for the European
Championship qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
Gascoigne, who spent four seasons with Tottenham from 1988 to
1992, was given a generous reception by the home crowd and he and
Andy Townsend controlled the midfield area.
</P>
<P>
The victory lifted Middlesgrough to sixth place on eight
points Aston Villa lead on 13 points after beating Wimbledon 2-0
on Saturday and have a three-point advantage over Liverpool, who
lost 2-1 at West Ham.
</P>
<P>
Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson was delighted with a second
successive away win following the midweek victory at Leicester.
</P>
<P>
"That's given us a lot of encouragement," he said, adding that
he was particularly pleased with his newlook central defensive
trio of Gary Pallister, Colin Cooper and Steve Vickers.
</P>
<P>
"The last time we were in the premier league (two seasons ago)
we only won two away games all season but with that backline we
feel we can go away and get results now," said Robson.
</P>
<P>
Ricard's first goal came after 25 minutes. The Colombian
turned Colin Calderwood, slipped the ball to Danish strike
partner Mikkel Beck and raced on to the return before firing low
past Espen Baardsen in the Tottenham goal.
</P>
<P>
Ricard and Beck combined in similar fashion for the second
after 32 minutes. Ricard flicked a throw-in to Beck who headed
the ball across the edge of the penalty area and the Colombian
outpaced Calderwood to lash the bouncing ball into the net.
</P>
<P>
Tottenham, who parted company with Swiss manager Christian
Gross a week ago, had won their last two games, but their best
effort in a sorry first-half performance was a David Ginola free
kick comfortably saved by 'Boro goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer.
</P>
<P>
Middlesbrough continued to create better chances after the
break and Beck twice tested Baardsen with excellent shots from
distance.
</P>
<P>
Slovakian Kinder, who replaced Gascoigne five minutes from
time, made it 3-0 after 87 minutes with a swerving shot that
surprised the otherwise outstanding Baardsen, who could only
fumble it into the net.
</P>
<P>
The closest Tottenham came to scoring was an injury time
header from substitute Chris Armstrong which hit the post.
</P>
<P>
David Pleat, standing in as team manager until Gross's
successor is found, was decidedly unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
"It's disappointing as the two wins in a row had got
everyone's hopes up," he said. "Maybe some our players started
believing their own publicity. We had lots of possession but most
of it was futile."

<P>
CANBERRA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton and the White House Sunday
launched a counterattack to try to save the Clinton presidency,
deriding independent counsel Kenneth Starr's impeachment report as
a "hit-and-run smear campaign."
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian election is still on a razor's edge, with
Prime Minister John Howard and his rival Kim Beazley locked in an
electoral arm wrestle after the great debate at Sunday night
failed to break the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister John Howard firmly linked the government's
electoral credibility with its pursuit of the 10 percent goods and
service tax during Sunday night's televised election debate,
saying it was what made his tax reform package believable.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister John Howard pinned the credibility of his
leadership on his plan to impose a goods and service tax at last
night's debate, arguing that Australians knew there could be no
long-term gains without some pain.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian Labor Party flagged a re-regulation of
Australia's banks if it wins the October 3 federal election,
vowing to reintroduce controls on bank fees and charges, and other
interventionist measures.

<HEADLINE> Rafter Wins U.S. Open Men's Singles Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Patrick Rafter of Australia
put the crowning touch on an outstanding year Sunday as he
successfully defended his U.S. Open men's title with 6-3, 3-6,
6-2, 6-0 victory over fellow Australian unseeded Mark
Philippoiussis.
</P>
<P>
Rafter took control of the match midway through the third set
when he broke Philippoussis to lead 4-2, and then reeled off 10
consecutive games to clinch the title.
</P>
<P>
Rafter entered the tournament as the hottest player on the
men's tour and he continued his torrid play Sunday in the first
U.S. Open final between two Australians since 1970.
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Rafter became the sixth player of the Open
Era to successfully defend his U.S. Open title. He recorded his
sixth tournament title of the year and ran his record to 25-2
since Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
Rafter, who was seeded third, played masterful tennis and
except for one brief moment in the second set when he faltered
and had his serve broken, was in control for the entire match.
</P>
<P>
Overall, Rafter had six aces and only one double fault, with
39 winners against only five unforced errors. He forced 20 break
points and was successful on six.
</P>
<P>
Philippoussis, playing in his first Grand Slam final, could
not capitalize on his usually powerful serve. He managed only
five aces and committed 13 double faults, the final one coming on
match point. He had 34 winners but made 29 unforced errors.
Philippoussis could force only three break points against Rafter
and was successful on one.

ISLAMABAD -- The Islamic Taliban militia Sunday rejected Iran's
request for tendering an apology and handing over the killers of
nine Iranian diplomats.
</P>
<P>
"We will never tender apology to Iran for the killing of its
diplomats as the Afghan Islamic Emirate is not involved in the
incident," Taliban's envoy in Pakistan, Saeedur Rahman Haqqani
told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Eleven Iranian diplomats and one reporter went missing when the
Taliban fighters took over the northern Afghan city of
Mazar-e-Sharif, headquarters of the pro-Iranian northern alliance,
early last month.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who have been denying Iran's allegations of
abducting these Iranians, announced Wednesday that it had

BONN -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's main political allies,
the Christian Social Union (CDU) party, succeeded in defending its
absolute majority in the local parliamentary election in the
southern German state of Bavaria on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a local vote widely seen as a sentiment test for the German
national elections just two weeks away, the CSU, the Bavarian
sister party of Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), managed
to win about 53 percent of the vote, almost unchanged from its
showing of 52.8 percent in the 1994 local election, preliminary
computer projections showed.
</P>
<P>
Germany's main opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD), which
is leading Kohl in popularity polls nationwide, scored only a
little more than 29 percent, down from its 1994 showing of 30
percent, thus failing to orchestrate a major setback for Kohl as
it expected earlier. (Germany-local Election)
