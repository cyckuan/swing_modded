<HEADLINE> Blair Gives Tyson Visa Hope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Controversial American boxer Mike
Tyson's bid to fight in Britain for the second time received a
boost Wednesday when Prime Minister Tony Blair spoke in support of
the decision to let him into the country for the first fight.
</P>
<P>
Tyson, who knocked out Julius Francis in Manchester in January,
has applied for a visa to return to Britain to fight Lou Saverese
in Glasgow on June 24.
</P>
<P>
Scottish politicians and women's groups say Tyson, who served a
three-year sentence for a rape conviction, should be barred.
</P>
<P>
Immigration laws bar foreign nationals with serious convictions
from entering the United Kingdom. Home Secretary Jack Straw
granted Tyson special dispensation for the Francis fight.
</P>
<P>
The issue was raised during Prime Minister's Question Time in
the House of Commons after two MPs urged the Government to prevent
Tyson from entering this time.
</P>
<P>
Labor MP Jenny Jones said she often had to explain to her
constituents with relatives from abroad why their family members
were refused permission to visit in order to attend weddings and
funerals in Britain.
</P>
<P>
"Do you agree with me that my task would be made more difficult
if Mike Tyson, who has been convicted of a serious criminal
offense, is allowed into this country for purely commercial gain?"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Blair said: "This is a decision for Home Secretary Jack Straw
and I am glad about that. I am afraid I agree with the previous
decision of the Home Secretary. He will obviously have to make his
decision over the next few weeks and I am sure he will do so."
</P>
<P>
In January, Straw cited exceptional circumstances in letting
Tyson into the country, saying a cancellation of the Francis fight
would have cost small businesses in Manchester millions of pounds.
But he also suggested that the visa might be a one-off.
</P>
<P>
"The Government has done a lot of good work making it clear
that violence against women is unacceptable," Jones said in a BBC
radio interview. "Allowing Mike Tyson into the country would send
out all the wrong signals.
</P>
<P>
"The law says that if someone has committed a serious offense,
they shouldn't be allowed in the country. I think this should
apply to Mike Tyson, even though he is rich and famous, the same
as it applies to everyone else."
</P>
<P>
"The circumstances are different this time," she added. "Last
time, the fight had been organized and lots of money had been
spent and small businesses were saying they were going to lose
money if Mike Tyson didn't come. This time there is plenty of time
for the Home Secretary to give a considered decision that Mike
Tyson should not come," she said.
</P>
<P>
The promoters of the fight, Sports Network, expect to find out
whether the fight will go ahead next week. They say the fight
could be moved to another European city if Tyson is barred.

<HEADLINE> Sheringham to Stay in Man United </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Teddy Sheringham has agreed to stay
at Manchester United for another year after manager Alex Ferguson
assured him he would not buy a new striker.
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old could have moved to another club on a free
transfer but instead has signed a new one-year contract with the
champions.
</P>
<P>
Sheringham, who came on as a substitute to score the vital
equaliser in last year's Champions League final, had been worried
about being pushed further into the background at Old Trafford.
</P>
<P>
But the breakdown of Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy's 18.5
million pounds move from PSV Eindhoven, combined with Ferguson's
promise not to look for another forward, has reassured Sheringham
at least another year at the very top of English football.
</P>
<P>
Sheringham, who joined for 3.5 million pounds from Tottenham in
1997, said: "I am really pleased that the matter has been resolved
and that I am remaining a Manchester United player."
</P>
<P>
"All the players retain a real hunger for honours and we want
to emulate the success of recent years, particularly that of 1999.
I have had a fabulous three years with the club and have decided
to stay in an attempt to win more trophies, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Sheringham only scored six goals for United this past season
but most of them were crucial, including the equaliser in the 1-1
draw against Arsenal in January that proved an important
psychological blow in the race for the Premiership.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson accepted the temptations for Sheringham to look for
another club had been great.
</P>
<P>
He said: "I had a chat with Teddy last week to assure him that
he was very much part of plans for next season. He has had a great
time with the club and has benefited from the success we have
enjoyed. Equally, so have we. It has been a great partnership for
all concerned."
</P>
<P>
"It would have been easy for Teddy to have gone elsewhere but
he doesn't want to leave and that's good for us all. The players,
directors, staff and supporters all want him to stay," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sheringham's agent Barry Nevill said that Ferguson's assurances
had helped the striker make up his mind.
</P>
<P>
"That played a big part," said Nevill. "They obviously had a
very constructive chat and the fact that Sir Alex spoke to him
helped Teddy make his decision."
</P>
<P>
United chairman Martin Edwards expressed his delight, saying: "
We have been working on a new contract with Teddy for some time
and it's great news for us that he has decided to stay. He has
been a very important part of our recent success."
</P>
<P>
Numerous clubs, including West Ham, Charlton, Tottenham and
Portuguese side Sporting Lisbon, had been linked with Sheringham.

<HEADLINE> Mental Toughness Vital Factor in Thomas Cup Semifinals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Nothing so sure when the
Thomas Cup coming into the semi-finals except that the four
contenders switched on their best forms to capture the most
unpredicable finals of the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Defending champions Indonesia will face Denmark on Friday while
China set up a meet with South Korea in the semi-finals on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
"The Thomas Cup title-battle here is the most unpredictable one
in the past decade," China's coach Li Yongbo said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The battle is more of a rivalry of mental toughness and
strategy than the contradiction of their strength as neither team
could boost with unquestionable edge of the others.
</P>
<P>
"There is no team who has the best players on both the singles
and doubles," said Indonesian coach Sumaryono Hadi Nasri. "Like
China, whose doubles may not as good as their singles, but it
doesn't mean their doubles are not dangerous."
</P>
<P>
As is the case logical to the other three teams that Indonesia
and South Korea are better on the doubles and Denmark are stronger
on the singles. However, all the four teams are confident to beat
their semi-finals opponents, remarking that they were not fear to
take on any opposition.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia are the hottest favorites to reign the championship
here with much balanced singles and doubles mixed-up. Nasri said,
"We felt confident that we are the best team in the event. It
makes no difference for us to face any opponents in the semi-
finals."
</P>
<P>
But to face Denmark is a better choice for Indonesia, who
topped Group A of the preliminary round, compared to a semi-final
clash with South Korea, who
finished first in the other group.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia pin their hopes of taking two points from the two
world top doubles pairs, Candra Wijaya/Tony Gunawan and Ricky
Ahmad Subagja/Rexy Mainaky, in the semi-finals against Denmark.
Their singles first choice Hendrawan is not in the class to
Denmark's first singles Peter Gade Christensen, who kept a clean
record so far in the competition, but their second singles Taufik
Hidayat serves as the decisive factor for a win.
</P>
<P>
Hidayat, 18, finalist of the past two All-England Opens, was
tagged as the best second singles player in the tournament, even
compared with Denmark's Olympic champion Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen,
ranked third in the world.
</P>
<P>
"We're not of any advantage to beat Indonesia,"said Dane coach
Kenneth Larsen. "But I'm satisfied with my players' abilities to
deal with the nerve in the match against the hosts Malaysia. The
mental toughness may send us through."
</P>
<P>
China rested the All-England winner Xian Xuanze and former
world champion Sun Jun in the tie against Indonesia on Monday, but
they will not save any strength in Thursday's semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
"Wait for the best in the semi-finals," China's coach Li Yongbo
pledged after preliminary-round loss to Indonesia. Their semi-
final rivals South Korea were also in no fear to the talent-
bounded medal-banded Chinese squad.
</P>
<P>
South Korean manager Kwon Seung Taik said their doubles pairs
could take two points. "I'm confident with my two doubles pair.
They will take two points from China, no problem for that. But if
we want to win the semi-finals, we must take the second or third
singles games."
</P>
<P>
On the second singles, the South Koreans would field Lee Hyun
Li, who beat Hoyer-Larsen in a 3-2 win over Denmark, against the
Japan Open champion Ji Xinpeng, rated eighth. Sun Jun, winner of
the 1998 All-England Open, is likely to take the third singles
after recovering from thigh injures.

<P>
STOCKHOLM, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Galatasaray beat English premier
side Arsenal on penalties in the Danish Capital Copenhagen on
Wednesday, becoming the first Turkish club to win a European
trophy.
</P>
<P>
The Turks won the shootout 4-1 after the game finished goalless
after extra time.
</P>
<P>
Croat Davor Suker, Arsenal's first penalty-taker, hit post and
Frenchman Patrick Vieira hit the bar leaving Gheorghe Popescu to
smash in Galatasaray's winning spot kick.
</P>
<P>
Galatasaray had been reduced to 10 men four minutes into extra
time when Gheorghe Hagi was sent off for punching Arsenal skipper
Tony Adams.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal's best chance came in the second half of extra time
when in-form French striker Thierry Henry went for a point-blank
header, but Galatasaray's Brazilian World Cup goalkeeper Claudio
Taffarel made a brilliant save to keep out the effort.

<HEADLINE> Barcelona President Steps Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Barcelona president Josep Lluis
Nunez, one of the most influential soccer figures in Europe,
stepped down on Wednesday after 22-year service in the one of
world's most successful clubs.
</P>
<P>
Nunez announced his resignation during a meeting of the board
of directors. His term of office does not officially expire until
2002, but growing discontent from the fans apparently undermined
his will to carry on.
</P>
<P>
A club spokesman said his successor would be chosen in
elections set for July, after which Nunez would remain on board
long enough to oversee the transition.
</P>
<P>
Among the candidates to replace Nunez is club vice-president
Joan Gaspert who said on Wednesday that he was "thinking seriously
" of applying for the job.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona's failure this season to make the Champions League
final and their expulsion from the Spanish Cup semifinals earlier
this month tested the fans' patience, leading to demands for Nunez
to go.
</P>
<P>
The 68-year-old businessman took over the presidency of
Barcelona in 1978, and during his time, the team has won more than
25 cups, among them seven league titles, six Spanish Cups and one
European Cup.

<HEADLINE> OAU Makes Proposals on Setting up COMESA Free Trade Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GRAND BAIE, Mauritius, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for
African Unity (OAU) made some proposals here Wednesday for
sustaining the momentum of the Free Trade Area (FTA) to be
established by the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA) on October 31 this year.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony of the fifth COMESA summit, OAU
Assistant Secretary-General Vijay Makhan said that the COMESA
region is the first among the African regional economic
communities to be on the threshold of its kick-off date for the
establishment of a Free Trade Area.
</P>
<P>
The creation of regional Free Trade Area is an important step
envisaged in the Abuja Treaty establishing the African Economic
Community, he said.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the FTA is not a destination but a
milestone -- albeit an important milestone -- in a long journey,
said OAU official.
</P>
<P>
He said sustaining the momentum of the FTA will require
coordination among COMESA countries to facilitate a stable macro
economic environment including tight inflation control and
realistic exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the success of the FTA would require
individual national economies to maintain broad convergence in
macro economic variables.
</P>
<P>
This is crucial if investors and exporters are to be able to
plan with confidence and if the FTA is to provide a level playing
field, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called for facilitating both a proactive foreign investment
strategy as well as support for indigenous enterprise development
particularly targeted at the micro, small and medium sized
enterprises and linked to exports.
</P>
<P>
Sustaining the momentum of the FTA will require the
facilitation of strong public/private sector partnerships at the
national level as well as within the FTA as the basis of
policy-making on trade, investment and exports, Makhan said.
</P>
<P>
Sustaining the momentum of the FTA would require sustained
investment in human capital at all levels and increased enterprise
training, he said, saying that "Our most important assets in
development are our human resources."
</P>
<P>
He also called for efficient and cost-competitive
infrastructure especially with respect to air and sea cargo,
telecommunications, internet access and electricity.
</P>
<P>
"Adequate infrastructure is crucial for trade and investment
between COMESA countries and with the outside world and the scope
for sectoral cooperation is indeed wide in this regard," said the
OAU assistant secretary general.

<HEADLINE> Mere Trade Liberalization not Enough for Growth: Mauritian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GRAND BAIE, Mauritius, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Mauritian Prime
Minister Navinchandra Ramgoolam warned Wednesday that only trade
liberalization was not enough to boost economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"Total liberalization of trade among member states will not by
itself enable us to reach our ultimate goal," he said in a speech
at the opening ceremony of the fifth summit of the Common Market
for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) here.
</P>
<P>
"We must recognize that many of the factors that have inhibited
growth in the past are still with us," he said. "Of the forces
that compromised the development of sub-Saharan countries,
individually and collectively, only few have subsided."
</P>
<P>
"Deep-seated weakness in our economies and societies stands in
the way of sustainable development," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We need therefore to steer a steady course guided by our
commitment to peace, democracy, good governance and the
alleviation of poverty," he said.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Urges Rebels to Stop Insurgency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone rebels will be facing
trial if they continue their terrorist campaign against innocent
citizens and the United Nations peacekeepers, a Sierra Leone
official warned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Defence Minister Hinga Norman made the remarks at an
emergency meeting of defence ministers and chiefs of staff of the
16-member Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in
Nigerian capital Abuja to discuss Sierra Leone crisis.
</P>
<P>
He also called for assistance of international community to put
back on track the Lome Peace Accord signed in July 1999 which
grants amnesty to rebels.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the arrest of Foday Sankoh, leader of the rebel
Revolutionary United Front (RUF), Norman said the arrest would
advance the course of peace in his country.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh, who was held responsible for the abduction of about 500
U.N. peacekeepers by the RUF rebels earlier this month, was seized
by pro- government forces on Wednesday in the capital Freetown
after he disappeared last week when his bodyguards shot a dozen of
protesters dead outside his Freetown house.

<HEADLINE> Editorial: Annette Lu's Remarks on Taiwan Status Extremely Dangerous (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan independence elements represented by Annette Lu's
statement that "Taiwan is an independent sovereign state" is a
blatant advocacy of Taiwan independence, it adds.
</P>
<P>
"They aim to separate Taiwan from China, and the Chinese people
will not tolerate this advocacy," it emphasizes.
</P>
<P>
At a time when people on both sides of the Straits, as well as
the international community, are expecting improved relations, a
small number of elements led by Lu still advocate that "Taiwan is
an independent sovereign state," showing their ignorance of
Chinese history and the law.
</P>
<P>
"This is a blatant provocation against the one China principle
and the entire Chinese people. It also betrays the interests of
the people of Taiwan, as it is intended to damage relations
between the two sides," the editorial adds.
</P>
<P>
If the new Taiwan leader adopts Lu's position, dialogues and
negotiations between the two sides can not be conducted, and a new
crisis will emerge in the Taiwan Straits, which will damage cross-
Straits relations and threaten peace and stability in the Asia-
Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says the mainland has noticed that the new Taiwan
leader has expressed his intention to improve cross-Straits
relations.
</P>
<P>
If he is sincere, he should respect the Taiwan people's wish
for peace and stability, give up the position that "Taiwan is an
independent sovereign state," and work toward the direction of the
one China principle.

<HEADLINE> Editorial: Annette Lu's Remarks on Taiwan Status Extremely Dangerous (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an editorial to be published tomorrow, the paper says Lu has
an ulterior motive for emphasizing Taiwan's status on the eve of
the new Taiwan leader's declaration of his policies.
</P>
<P>
It is an indisputable fact that Taiwan has been a part of China,
and has never been an "independent sovereign state," the editorial
stresses.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has never been a country, it notes, adding that this has
been proved by both history and law.
</P>
<P>
Since 1949, the two sides of the Taiwan Straits have been apart,
but China's sovereignty over Taiwan has never changed, the
editorial says.
</P>
<P>
Despite long-term differences, the two sides had a common
understanding for quite a long period of time since 1949 that
there is only one China in the world, and Taiwan is a part of
China, it emphasizes.
</P>
<P>
It is based on this common understanding that the peaceful
reunification is possible and the two sides can settle political
differences through dialogue for ending enmity and realizing
reunification as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
The one China principle concerns China's sovereignty and
territorial integrity, and the interests of all Chinese people,
including the people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"We will never compromise on this point, and we will never give
up the one China principle," it stresses.

<HEADLINE> Rich Beijing Village Becomes Tourism Attraction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A rich village in suburban Beijing
has become a tourism attraction, receiving 100,000 visitors a year,
including some 3,000 visitors from overseas.
</P>
<P>
The Village, Hancunhe Village in Fangshan District in Beijing
is regarded as the richest village in the Beijing area, with all
its 791 households living in villas and luxury apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
"With convenient traffic and comfortable living conditions,
people like to enjoy the rural life and fresh air" said a local
farmer Zhang.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of hotels, many visitors stay with us just like a
family member, eating and working together with us," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The village used to be very poor, but like many other Chinese
villages, Hancunhe became rich after the Open Door Policy was
introduced in 1978.
</P>
<P>
"It looks like a fairy tale world -- quiet, clean, and
beautiful, that is why I came here for my holiday," said Wang Yu,
a visitor from Beijing. "I think Hancunhe is a model for other
Chinese villages," he said.

<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Youngsters in Beijing now have
access to sex education both inside and outside schools.
</P>
<P>
China's younger generation knew very little about sex education
in the past. However, the country has been encouraging the sex
education in schools when China began to introduce the policies of
reforms and opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
"Knowing something about sex will help youngsters avoid
problems relating to sex and grow up more healthily," said Xiang
Chunxiang, director of the Beijing Education Center on Family
Planning.
</P>
<P>
Official figures says that there are some 100 middle schools in
Beijing that offer sex education courses.
</P>
<P>
Boys and girls can also go to various sex consultants or
hotlines offered by related organizations for help.
</P>
<P>
In the Beijing No. 25 Middle School, students can receive
classes on physiology in junior grades and classes on love,
marriage and family in senior grades.

<HEADLINE> Endangered Birds Bred In Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Zoologists from the Beijing Zoo
have bred over 20 crested ibises, an endangered bird, over the
past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Visitors to the zoo will have a chance to meet the rare birds
this autumn, said a local zoologist.
</P>
<P>
The crested ibis population has grown from merely seven in 1981,
when it was first found in Yangxian County, northwest China's
Shaanxi Province, to some 200 as a result of the development of
breeding technology and environmental protection measures.
</P>
<P>
To give the birds better protection, China invested three
million yuan to set up an ibis breeding center in Yangxian County
in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Zoo took six young birds from the Center for research
and began breeding in 1986. The zoologists successfully bred the
birds in 1992.
</P>
<P>
There used to be large flocks of these crested ibis,
distinguished by its red crest, gray plumage and hooked beak, in
China, Japan and Germany. But now the bird is found only in Japan
and China.

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen Anti-Drug Education Among Lawbreakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government will take
resolute measures to strengthen the anti-drug education among
lawbreakers, Deng Ming, an official with China's National
Narcotics Control Commission said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The lawbreakers, confined in such places as prisons, lock-ups,
detention houses, reform-through-labor institutions, and study-
through-labor institutions, are considered the most likely to
become drug users.
</P>
<P>
Because of the high drug abuse rate among the population in
these places, it is of vital importance to strengthen anti-drug
education there, and this should be a key part of the nationwide
anti-drug campaign, Deng added.
</P>
<P>
Drug abuse has become an increasingly serious problem in China
in recent years, and by the end of 1999 there were 680,000
registered drug users in the country, up 14.3 percent compared
with the 1998 figure.
</P>
<P>
Deng also said the National Narcotics Control Commission
recently sent photos, video tapes, and VCDs on drug control to all
the grassroots units to facilitate this education program.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Supreme Leader Orders to Confirm Tehran Polling Result </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei on Thursday ordered the conservative Guardian Council to
confirm the result of the February parliamentary elections in the
capital city of Tehran to prevent possible unrest in the country.
</P>
<P>
In response, the council, the watchdog of elections, said it
would announced the election result in Tehran on Saturday at the
latest.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei's order removed the final obstacle for the reformist
allies of President Mohammad Khatami to take over the powerful
Majlis (parliament) on May 27 from the conservatives, who suffered
a humiliating defeat in the parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
In reply to a letter of the council's Secretary Ayatollah Ahmad
Jannati, Khamenei asked the council to halt its scrutiny of ballots
in Tehran constituency and to announce the final result.
</P>
<P>
The council should nullify the polls of boxes it considered
invalid for any reason and confirm the results of other boxes it
considered intact, the state-run television quoted Khamenei's
letter as saying.
</P>
<P>
Jannati had said in his letter to Khamenei that his council
could not confirm the election result in Tehran constituency as it
had found serious discrepancies after recounting the polls in 868
out of the total 3000 boxes.
</P>
<P>
The reformists have won 29 out of the total 30 seats in Tehran
constituency according to the first announcement, but the Guardians
Council delayed the confirmation and ordered three recounts of
parts of the boxes.
</P>
<P>
Some reports said that the council might approve the first 25
winners and leave the remaining five seats to a runoff.
</P>
<P>
Unwilling to accept the reformists' landslide victory in the
parliamentary elections, the conservative-controlled council had
nullified the results of 12 constituencies, depriving nine
reformists from entering the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
The conservative-dominated judiciary also ordered the closure of
17 reformist newspapers and journals, which played an important
role in the February parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The reformists tolerated the conservatives' intensified
crackdown and urged the people to keep calm so that the new Majlis
can take over on time to push forward Khatami's reformist programs.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Says Always Been Involved in Land Reform In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP)has always been involved in the land
reform in Zimbabwe, Mark Malloch Brown, Administrator of UNDP,
said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a statement that the U.N. Secretary-General, Kofi
Annan, had asked UNDP to explore the possibility of helping
facilitating a renewed land reform programme in Zimbabwe, Malloch
Brown told the press "This is based on the extensive consultations
by him personally with different parties as well as by myself and
my colleges in UNDP."
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to arrive at a political solution, but through a
development and a technical approach," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General is not sending a special representative
or envoy. He is trying to address it as a development issue," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Malloch Brown said UNDP is well placed to play such a role
because of its experience as a trusted partner in Zimbabwe,
including co-chairing with the Government the 1998 International
Donors Conference on Land Reform and Resettlement, recognized by
international donors, the Government of Zimbabwe and the
Commercial Farmers Union.
</P>
<P>
The inequitable land ownership patterns have long been a source
of political and economic tension in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. statement issued this morning, currently
some 4,460 large-scale commercial farmers own 11.2 million
hectares, much of it the most fertile land, while over 6 million
people, living mainly in communal areas, occupy 16.4 million
hectares.

<HEADLINE> Dominican Ruling Party Candidate Admits Mejia's Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Medina opened with this decision the way for Mejia, of the
opposition Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD), to be declared the
winner and occupy the presidency, according to reports reaching
here from Santo Domingo.
</P>
<P>
Mejia accumulates 49.86 percent of the vote at the time that
the scrutinizing is near completion, but does not have the
absolute majority of 50 percent of the ballots plus one to be
declared the outright winner of the general election of Tuesday
this week.
</P>
<P>
According to the electoral laws, if none of the candidates
obtains the absolute majority, the two who had garnered the
biggest number of votes will vie for the presidency in a second
round election, which in this case is scheduled for June 30.
</P>
<P>
Mejia leads the voting, according to the Central Electoral
Board, followed by nonagenarian candidate Joaquin Balaguer, of the
Christian Social Reformist Party (PRSC).
</P>
<P>
The JCE gives Medina and Balaguer less than 25 percent of the
vote each and distributes the rest among the other candidates.
</P>
<P>
Balaguer recognized Wednesday Mejia's victory in an explicit
way with a congratulatory message to the PRD "for its fairly
obtained triumph" in the general election of Tuesday this week.
</P>
<P>
Mejia thanked his opponents for their decision, while elections
board spokesman Wilfredo Alemany promised an announcement would be
made later Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The board had been re-examining 46,000 invalidated ballots to
determine whether the populist Mejia _ who already had declared
victory _ cleared the 50-percent threshold. Because each polling
station can have no more than 600 voters, it seemed unlikely that
the regular vote count could do that.

LIMA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A national agriculture strike called
by the National Agrarian Confederation (CNA) and the Peruvian
Peasants Confederation (CCP) started Thursday in Peru.
</P>
<P>
Cuzco peasants labor union general secretary Washington Mendoza
said that the strike aims at obtaining better prices for their
products, a reactivation of the rural activities and to stop the

this Andean city from 9:00 in the morning and marched peacefully
toward the Agriculture Ministry's building, where they started an
impromptu rally.
</P>
<P>
"We protest against the low prices assigned to our products
like potatoes, corn, wheat, barley, and other agriculture products
that are now substituted for with imported foodstuffs," said
Mendoza.
</P>
<P>
The peasants leader announced that this strike will last eight
days and will affect 1.75 million peasants in the other Peruvian
departments of Junin, Apurimac, Puno, Huancavelica, Cajamarca,

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Protestant Party Delays Key Vote Date </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's main pro-British
Protestant party said on Thursday it would postpone the vote on
whether to resume shared government with the Catholics.
</P>
<P>
Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble said he was ready to
support the proposals to return to Northern Ireland's power-
sharing executive with Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said he had received the assurances he needs to
recommend the Irish Republican Army offer to put its arms beyond
use to his party's 860-member ruling council.
</P>
<P>
Trimble told the BBC that his decision to back the return of
power-sharing was made only after receiving assurances about the
IRA arms offer as late as Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, scheduled on Saturday, would be postponed for one
week and be held on May 27.
</P>
<P>
The postponement followed confirmation from Downing Street that
it had "come to the end" of its process to meet unionist concerns.
</P>
<P>
The British and Irish governments had planned to reinstate a
fledgling power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland on Monday
after it was suspended in February over deadlock on guerrilla
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Plans for the resumption of Northern Ireland home rule followed
an offer by the IRA to put its weapons in secret dumps and open
them to foreign monitors.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- China Thursday called on all
Member States, in particular the largest contributor, to pay their
dues in full, on time and without conditions.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Fifth Committee of the United Nations on aspects
of peacekeeping finance, Chinese delegate Sun Minqin said there
was clearly no direct link between the current financial crisis
and the existing peacekeeping scale.
</P>
<P>
The present system for financing peacekeeping had been decided
following discussion among Member States, and the principle, of
capacity to pay, that relied on was in keeping with the Charter of
the United Nations and had been proven itself over time, she said.
</P>
<P>
The peacekeeping scale should reflect the principles of
capacity to pay, she said.
</P>
<P>
As a permanent Security Council member, China understood its
responsibility for world peace and stability, and has
conscientiously fulfilled its financial obligations for
peacekeeping, she said.
</P>
<P>
However, China was resolutely opposed to the setting of any
floor or ceiling rates for permanent members of the Security
Council, and such a measure was unacceptable and violated the
principle of capacity to pay, she added.

<HEADLINE> Syrian, Iraqi Ministers Discuss Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Minister of Oil and Mineral
Resources Muhammad Maher Jamal held talks here Thursday with
visiting Iraqi Minister of Trade Mohammad Mehdi Salah on
cooperation in the fields of oil and mineral resources under the
Oil-for-Food Program.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers discussed the signed accords and ways to
implement them to serve the common interests of the brotherly
peoples of Syria and Iraq, the Arab-Syrian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Salah told reporters after the meeting that "the opening of the
Iraqi Interests Mission in Damascus is a first positive step on the
road of diplomatic exchanges."
</P>
<P>
In February two Iraqi diplomats attended the opening ceremony of
the mission under the auspices of the Algerian Embassy in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
In 1999 Iraq reopened its trade center in Damascus while Syria
opened a similar center in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Syria severed their diplomatic relations in 1980 and
started the normalization process in 1998. The bilateral borders
were opened for businessmen and officials, thus leading to
development of economic exchanges between Damascus and Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Salah arrived here Tuesday evening for a three-day visit to
Syria. On Wednesday Salah met Syrian Minister of Economy and
Foreign Trade Mohammed al Imadi and reviewed with him the
facilities of the Syria port of Tartous and the implementation of
accords on Iraq's imports of pharmaceuticals, detergents and
foodstuffs through the Syrian port.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak's Visit to Spain to Boost Cooperation Ties: Spanish Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's
forthcoming visit to Spain would boost the bilateral ties and
further strengthen cooperation between Madrid and Cairo, the
Spanish ambassador here said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Juan Alfonso Ortiz Ramos told Egypt's Middle East News Agency
that during the three-day visit starting on May 29, Mubarak will
hold talks with Spanish King Juan Carlos I and Prime Minister Jose
Maria Aznar on the Middle East peace process and bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador expressed hope that Mubarak's trip would help
give a boost to the Arab-Israeli peace talks, which he said are
undergoing a crucial stage.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Spain maintain good relations after Madrid hosted the
Middle East peace conference attended by Arab countries, including
Egypt, and Israel in October 1991.
</P>
<P>
The visit would activate the economic, trade, and investment
cooperation between the two countries, which are bound by an array
of agreements, the Spanish diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Ortiz stressed the necessity of deepening trade cooperation and
joint investments.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume stood at around 600 million U.S. dollars in
1999 between Egypt and Spain, with Egypt exporting 120 million
dollars worth of goods. Spain's 1.2 billion dollars of investments
are mainly in Egypt's oil sector.
</P>
<P>
Spain has provided Egypt with soft loans totaling 300 million
dollars at an interest rate of 1.5 percent, to be repaid over 40
years. It has also granted Egypt 10 million dollars to fund
feasibility studies for projects in Egypt, in which the two
countries have agreed to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's visit will coincide with the golden jubilee of the
Egyptian Institute for Islamic and Cultural Research in Madrid, the
Spanish ambassador noted, calling for cementing cultural ties
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The institute was founded by the Arabic literature icon, late
Taha Hussein, and is one of the most important institutions in
Spain, according to the news agency.

<HEADLINE> Member States Have to Enforce GM Crop Rules: EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union said on
Thursday that member states have to enforce rules on genetically
modified (GM) crops and that new Europe-wide legislation on GM
seeds would be not in place until Autumn.
</P>
<P>
"It's up to member states to trace where it (seed of
genetically modified crops) came from and why it happened," said a
spokeswoman for EU food safety commissioner David Byrne.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman made the remark in reaction to news that seeds
of genetically modified crops were sown by mistake in several EU
member states.
</P>
<P>
Press reports claimed that seeds of genetically modified
oilseed rape were sown by mistake in France over 600 hectares, in
Germany over 400 hectares, in Britain 500 hectares and in Sweden
though no details were given on the acreage for it.
</P>
<P>
Advanta Seeds, the company that imported the oilseed rape seeds
from Canada, admitted the mistake on Thursday. The company said
that all the governments concerned had been warned of the mistake.
</P>
<P>
It added that the mistake should not present risk to human
health or environment.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
bloc, said that the union's special committee on seed usage would
examine the case next week.
</P>
<P>
The EU's approval process for genetically modified crop
varieties has been deadlocked for over two years now with no
authorization given.
</P>
<P>
Under recent rules for food safety, products with any
ingredient containing more than 1 percent of genetically modified
material has to be labelled as containing GMOs (genetically
modified organisms).

<HEADLINE> World Bank Approves Loans to Iran For First Time in 6 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved Thursday
two loans totaling 232 million U.S. dollars to help Iran improve
primary health care and sewerage systems.
</P>
<P>
The loans, the first to Iran for six years, were approved by
the bank's board of directors despite objections from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The loans are to finance the Second Primary health Care and
Nutrition Project in the amount of 87 million dollars, and the
Tehran Sewerage Project in the amount of 145 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Both loans focus on basic human needs and target the under-
served areas and the poor, and are intended to support the reform
efforts of President Khatami, the World Bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that it will closely monitor the two projects
over their 5-6 year implementation period to ensure that agreed
benchmarks of progress are met.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank will only consider a broader resumption of
lending after the current efforts under the leadership of
President Khatami to strengthen governance and economic reforms
begin to show concrete results, it added.
</P>
<P>
The health and nutrition project aims to upgrade the primary
health care facilities which serve about 18 million people, mostly
women and children, in the poorer and under-served areas. The main
beneficiaries are children under two years of age and pregnant and
lactating mothers in provinces where malnutrition rates are
particularly high.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran Sewerage project would support investments in
wastewater collection and treatment in Greater Tehran where at
present only 10 percent of its 8 million residents have access to
waste water service.

<HEADLINE> EU Raids Coke Office in Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said on
Thursday that it had raided the office of the Belgian subsidiary
of Coca-Cola Enterprises as part of a widened anti-trust probe.
</P>
<P>
The raid was aimed at finding proof of possible breaches of the
European Union's anti-trust rules on the Belgian market and was
focused on whether the distribution practices of Coca-Cola
Enterprises constitute abuse of the company's dominant position,
said the commission in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The raid followed an anti-trust complaint from PepsiCo Inc.,
that is Coca-Cola's major rival in the world.
</P>
<P>
"We have fully cooperated with the officials and we remain
confident that all the activities we have in the Belgian market
fully comply with EU regulations," said Steve Leroy, spokesman for
Coke in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The European Union regulators last year swooped offices of
three Coca-Cola bottling plants in Europe and seized lots of
documents in the hope of finding evidence that Coca-Cola was
offering rebates to retails in an attempt to shut out competitors.
</P>
<P>
Companies found guilty of anti-competition practices in breach
of EU laws and rules can be fined up to 10 percent of their global
turnovers, though such hefty fines have never been levied except
for much smaller fines.
</P>
<P>
Coke together with Sprite and Fanta account for about half of
the soft drink market in Europe, with Pepsi a distant chaser.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Launch National Program on Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Namuyamba said the contribution made available through the
International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor (IPEC),
which is initiated by the International Labor Organization (ILO),
is aimed at enabling the Zambian government to implement the child
labor program at national level.
</P>
<P>
He said child labor would negatively affect the quality of the
future leaders and the labour force in general if left unabated.
</P>
<P>
Namuyamba said the Zambian government enforces legislation that
prohibits the employment of children under the age of 15 and 18.
</P>
<P>
Various provisions in the legislation have been successfully
enforced that child labor in the organized sector of the economy
is almost non existent, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the current legislation on child labor does not apply to
 employment of children and young persons on commercial farms and
the informal sector undertakings where the incidences of child
labor are on the increase.
</P>
<P>
Namuyamba said poverty and the HIV/AIDS pandemic are the major
factors that have compelled children to enter the world of work
prematurely.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government efforts to address these issues
are being hampered by the problem of debt servicing which swallows
resources which could have been used in developmental projects.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same function, ILO area office director Louis
Ndaba- Hagamye said the attainment of the objective of child labor
and the protection of children requires active involvement of the
media and other stake holders.
</P>
<P>
Ndaba-Hagamye said the co-operation between the Zambian
government and the ILO would be to promote conditions to enable
the government to progressively prohibit, restrict and regulate
child labor with a view of its ultimate elimination.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to take immediate and effective action
to bring to an end the worst forms of child labor that are
stunting millions of girls and boys, through international
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
According to the ILO's estimation, there are some 230 million
children who are in economic activity in developing countries
alone.

<HEADLINE> Door Still Open for Israeli-Syrian Accord: EU Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union special envoy
for the Middle East, Miguel Moratinos, said that the door is still
wide open for reaching a peace agreement between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that there are many obstacles hindering a
resumption of the Syrian-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a meeting here Thursday with Syrian
Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh, in which they discussed the peace
process on the Syrian track and the planned Israeli pullout from
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Syrian news agency, the two sides also
discussed the serious challenges facing the Middle East peace
process, the role of the EU in reviving this process and achieving
a just and comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Shareh emphasized that the U.N. Security Council
Resolution 425 should be fully and unconditionally implemented in a
way leading to the Israeli pullout from all occupied Lebanese
territories, including Shebaa farms covering an area of more than
10 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Israel has said that Shebaa farms, along the Lebanese-Syrian
border, are not included in its declared withdrawal from south
Lebanon because they are part of the Golan Heights, whose fate
should be negotiated with the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
The Shebaa plateau, 1,500 meters up on the slope of Mount Hermon
in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, is a vital source of water
that flows into the Sea of Galilee.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos and Shareh also discussed the Mediterranean-European
ministerial meeting slated to be held in Lisbon, Portugal from 25-
26 this month, and the Syrian-European relations that should be
developed in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos arrived here Wednesday on a short visit to Syria and
is due to leave Thursday afternoon for the Jordanian capital Amman.

<HEADLINE> Israel Warns of Increased Violence in West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli security forces are
preparing for increased violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in
the coming days, a top Israel Defense Forces (IDF) officer said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This is because the Palestinians will mark two "days of rage" to
show solidarity with hunger-striking Palestinian prisoners in
Israeli jails, IDF Central Commander Moshe Ya'alon said.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by Israel Radio that the IDF intelligence unit got
information that some Palestinians had distributed fliers
throughout the self-rule areas, calling for attacks against
Israelis on Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have declared Friday and Saturday as "days of
rage," during which protests are to be staged to demand the release
of the remaining 1,600 Palestinian security prisoners, who had been
on hunger strike in Israeli prisons since the beginning of the
month.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Palestinian negotiator for interim talks Saeb
Erekat announced that the contacts with Israel for implementing
interim agreements would not be resumed until the release of the
Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
However, an Israeli security official had informed the
Palestinians that Israel will not further release Palestinian
security prisoners at this stage, according to Israel Radio
reports.
</P>
<P>
The reason for this position is that any release now would
require changing the traditional criteria, which prohibited freeing
those Palestinians convicted of murdering Israelis, or prisoners "
with Jewish blood on their hands," the official said.
</P>
<P>
But the Jewish state does not want to do so for the moment,
especially in the context of bloody clashes between Palestinian
protesters demanding prisoner release and Israeli soldiers in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip in the past few days, he added.
</P>
<P>
The violence has left more than 10 Palestinians dead, several
hundreds injured since May 12, the bloodiest clashes since 1998.
</P>
<P>
Ya'alon, who is set to assume the office of deputy chief of
General Staff in the next few months, said Thursday that the
continued violence will hamper the transfer of three Arab villages
near Jerusalem to full Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
The top IDF officer said the transfer of Abu Dis, Azariya and
Swahara, which are currently under Israeli security and Palestinian
civilian control, will not be carried out before the Israeli-
Palestinian joint inquiry of the violence is finished and the
illegal arms held by Palestinian extremists are confiscated.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that the order for the handover, which was approved
by Israeli cabinet and Knesset (Parliament) on Monday under the
push of Prime Minister Ehud Barak, had not reached the IDF command.
</P>
<P>
In a related issue, Ya'alon denied reports that one of his
officers had threatened to bomb Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's
headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah with Cobra
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said earlier that the threat by Shlomo Oren, commander of
Israeli forces in the West Bank, was made at a late-night meeting
with his Palestinian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Oren reportedly said that he will order Israeli helicopters to
attack Arafat's headquarters if the violence in the West Bank
continued.
</P>
<P>
However, Ya'alon claimed that the quotation is "imprecise." In
his version, Oren only said "(the Palestinians') lack of control of
their forces, and the shooting by their forces at our
headquarters ... had almost led me to order the helicopters to
attack their command posts in Ramallah."
</P>
<P>
Oren did not even mention the name of the Chairman (Arafat),
Ya'alon told Israel Radio.

<HEADLINE> 6 Billion U.S. Dollars Earmarked for Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese cabinet announced plans to
allocate more that 6 billion U.S. dollars for development projects
over five years, the Daily Star newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The plan, prepared by the Council for Development and
Reconstruction, "primarily aims at developing all regions on the
same par; it actually allocates more funds to under-developed areas
than to others places," Information Minister Anwar Khalil was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to an outline of the plan distributed by Khalil, the
projects include upgrading networks of sewers, roads, drinking
water, electricity and telephones, as well as the garbage
processing, environmental protection, education and health care
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The total cost is 6.36 billion dollars, of which only 448
million has already been allocated for projects this year.
</P>
<P>
To fund the remaining 5.9 billion, to be spent up until 2004,
the government has 683 million in foreign grants. The remainder is
to be covered by the government, mainly from local and foreign
borrowing, according to the handout, but the plan urges the local
private sector to invest in the project.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Calls For Passage of PNTR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Alan Greenspan Thursday called on Congress to approve
permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) with China.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the White House together with President Bill
Clinton, Greespan said the outcome of the debate on PNTR with
China will have profound implications for the free world's trading
system and the long-term growth potential of the American economy.
</P>
<P>
The addition of the Chinese economy to the global marketplace
will result in a more efficient worldwide allocation of resources
and will raise standards of living in China and its trading
partners, Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China's progress towards prosperity and
accession into the WTO will create new opportunities for American
businesses and farmers.
</P>
<P>
"I believe extending PNTR to China and full participation by
China in the WTO is in the interests of the United States," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China's trade, now accounting for 3 percent
of world trade, should expand further in response to WTO
participation.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton, who is making speeches almost everyday to
urge the passage of PNTR bill by Congress, said that economically,
the case is clear and compelling.
</P>
<P>
"When Chairman Greenspan talks, the world listens. I just hope
that Congress is listening today," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was encouraged by Wednesday's vote in the
committees in both houses to overwhelmingly approve extending
permanent normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that granting PNTR status to China will promote
constructive relations with China and it is in the strategic
interests of the United States.

Annan had asked the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to
explore the possibility of helping facilitating a renewed land
reform programme in Zimbabwe, a press release from the U.N.
spokesman's office said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
UNDP is well placed to play such a role because of its
experience as a trusted partner in Zimbabwe, including co-chairing
with the Government the 1998 International Donors Conference on
Land Reform and Resettlement, recognized by international donors,
the Government of Zimbabwe and the Commercial Farmers Union, the
press release said.
</P>
<P>
UNDP's role, as a development organization, would involve
working with the Government of Zimbabwe and the international
community, especially donors, and those involved on the ground to
set up a mutually acceptable plan of action, it said.
</P>
<P>
By initiating such a process now, the Secretary-General hopes
it will help defuse the current confrontation and pave the way of
a just and equitable resolution to the problem, the release added.
</P>
<P>
The inequitable land ownership patterns have long been a
source of political and economic tension in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release, currently some 4,460 large-
scale commercial farmers own 11.2 million hectares, much of it the
most fertile land, while over 6 million people, living mainly in
communal areas, occupy 16.4 million hectares.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Use Chickens at Border against West Nile Virus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of common hens are being
listed by Canada's newest border guards to carry out sentry duty
on the border with the United States against a fatal virus.
</P>
<P>
The feather force will be stationed in chicken coops along 2,
500 kilometers of the border from Saskatchewan to New Brunswick as
a low-tech, early warning system against a West Nile virus, said
the country's National Post newspaper Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The step is taken as authorities fear that the fatal virus
threatens to spread from the United States this summer.
</P>
<P>
Harvey Artsob, chief of zoonotic diseases at Health Canada's
Laboratory Centre for Disease Control, was quoted as saying the
hens are "sentinels to tell us if the virus is active in Canada."
</P>
<P>
The virus is believed to cause no symptoms in chicken, but if
they are bitten by infected mosquitoes it will show up in weekly
blood tests.
</P>
<P>
West Nile virus, which originated in Africa, first appeared in
North America last year, infecting hundreds of people in New York
State and killing at least seven people.
</P>
<P>
In February, again U.S. scientists discovered the overwintered
virus inside some hibernating mosquitoes in New York.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Thursday commended Haiti's electoral council, Haitian
officials and the Haitian people for the great strides taken
toward holding legislative and local elections on May 21.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his spokesman's office, Annan said "
Over the last few months, extensive efforts have been made to
register voters, to establish a voting apparatus, and to plan for
this long-awaited polling."
</P>
<P>
"By turning out to register in large numbers, Haitians have
demonstrated their commitment to constitutionality and to the
democratic process," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"Free and fair polling is an important milestone for Haiti in
the restoration of governmental institutions and the strengthening
of the democratic process," the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
As election day approaches, Annan called on all Haitians to
forsake violence and to ensure that voters may exercise their
constitutional right to vote without intimidation.
</P>
<P>
Haiti is due to hold its legislative and municipal elections in
more than three years on Sunday. The vote is expected to
reestablish the parliament that President Rene Preval dissolved in
January 1999.
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen people have been killed in the last six
weeks as political violence has risen dramatically ahead of the
vote.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Sends Team to Assess Situation in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A Kenyan fact-finding team left
here Thursday for Sierra Leone, where 15 Kenyan U.N. peacekeepers
are still held hostage by the country's former rebels.
</P>
<P>
The mission, led by Minister of State Julius Sunkuli, comprises
 officials from Kenyan government and armed forces, and six of the
country's law makers.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will stay in Sierra Leone at least for one week,
said an official with the office of the Minister of State.
</P>
<P>
The team's main goal is to assess the situation and know
whether it is safe to maintain the Kenyan soldiers in the
war-ravaged west African country.
</P>
<P>
Kenya provided 825 soldiers to the United Nations peacekeeping
mission in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Some 25 of them were taken hostages earlier this month by
fighters of the former rebel, the Revolutionary United Front, and
have not been released.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government is making its inputs, in cooperation with
the United Nations to ensure the early release of the hostages,
according to the official.

<P>
MAPUTO, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican government Thursday urged
the 14- member Southern African Development Community (SADC) to
take a joint stand on whether to demand a change of venue of the
forthcoming summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi said Thursday in Maputo that his
 government made the recommendation because Mozambique is in full
solidarity with Angola.
</P>
<P>
He said his government understood that Angola has strong
reasons to move the venue from the Togolese capital, Lome.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has threatened to boycott the summit
unless it is moved to another venue, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Angolan government has accused Togolese President Gnassingbe
Eyadema of violating the sanctions imposed by the Security Council
of the United Nations against the Angolan rebels.
</P>
<P>
However, the Mozambican prime minister made it clear that his
country was not about to take any unilateral action, but wanted
the entire SADC region to reach a consensus.
</P>
<P>
"We will analyse the situation with our partners in SADC and
see what decision to take", he said. "We must take all of the SADC
into consideration".

<HEADLINE> Biodiversity Meeting Calls for Protocol on Alien Species </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Some delegates attending the fifth
meeting of the Conference of Parties to the Convention on
Biological Diversity here have called for a protocol to curb the
threat of alien species against ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
Some countries keep trying to address this problem through
domestic measures and they fail, because alien species are carried
across borders by ships and planes in international trade, and by
tourists travelling from one country to another, Rich Blaustein,
an environmental lawyer for the non-profit organization Defenders
of Wildlife, told a press conference here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Alien species are plants, animals or insects that have been
taken from their native environments and introduced into areas in
which they did not previously exist.
</P>
<P>
"Alien species have been widely recognized as the second
leading cause of biodiversity loss only after the direct
destruction of habitat", said Blaustein.
</P>
<P>
Alien species often have no natural predators or other
biological controls and therefore they out-compete native species
for food, eventually the entire ecosystem can be thrown out of
balance, Blaustein explained.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's Lake Victoria Environmental Management Program
operation officer Gasper Mallya described the damage caused by
water hyacinth, an alien species from South America.
</P>
<P>
"Water hyacinth first appeared in Kenya in 1962 and has become
an environmental disaster since late 1980s in the Lake Victoria
bordering Tanzania and Uganda," said Gasper Mallya.
</P>
<P>
"Due to the uncontrollable spread of hyacinth, other aquatic
plants and fish have been choked and shipping and fishing are
completely disrupted, " said Mallya.
</P>
<P>
Director of National Parks of Senegal Souleye Ndiaye and other
officials also briefed the damage of alien species in their
respective countries.
</P>
<P>
It will take at least several years for the parties to the
convention to negotiate a protocol on alien species, an official
at the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The fifth meeting of the 177 members began at the United
Nations Environment Program headquarters in Nairobi on May 15

JOHANNESBURG, May 18 (Xinhua) -- It is critical to develop
practical policy measures and options making African cities
economically viable, politically participatory and ecologically
sustainable, Namibian Prime Minister Hage Geingob said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian Press Agency quoted him on Thursday as telling

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Horticulture Export Income to Reach $155 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's horticultural export is
expected to earn more than 155 million U.S. dollars in the current
financial year ending in June compared with 125 million dollars it
earned last year, an official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Horticultural Promotion Council Director Stanley Heri said
earnings were expected to rise to some 180 to 200 million dollars
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
He said the horticultural sector had been able to maintain and
supply its traditional markets abroad despite the political
violence in the run up to parliamentary elections in June.
</P>
<P>
"New orders have been adversely affected and most buyers have
had to rationalize their orders," he said. "The problems facing
the industry have been more significant at home than abroad."
</P>
<P>
He said the main problem this year had been the excess rains
that fell last December, January and February which affected
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
The good thing that had happened to the industry, he said, had
been the production of perennial crops like citrus and flowers
which had been consistent with projected figures.
</P>
<P>
The horticulture industry is one of the country's major foreign
currency earners.

JOHANNESBURG, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The land crisis in Zimbabwe
will be the top question discussed by the British Prime Minister
Tony Blair and South African President Thabo Mbeki, South African
Press Association reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Britain and South Africa have adopted contrasting positions on
the months-long crisis in Zimbabwe, where hundreds of white-owned
farms have been invaded by landless supporters of Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
While London has demanded an end to the violence, Mbeki has
adopted a soft approach arguing that forceful public condemnation
of Mugabe's tactics will prove counter-productive.
</P>
<P>
Before Mbeki left Pretoria for a three-day official visit to
Britain, the two countries have reached a consensus that they
should seek common ground on how best to help defuse the situation
in the troubled country.
</P>
<P>
The South African leader is expected to call on Britain to
release a promised 36 million pounds (54 million U.S. dollars) to
finance land reform in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki is due to leave Britain on Saturday for a five-day tour

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 18 (Xinhua) -- This year will see South
Africa's own renaissance in the fight against crime as the country
is committed to the struggle, Safety and Security Minister Steve
Tshwete said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tshwete, speaking during a debate on his department's budget in
the National Assembly, said peace, stability and freedom from fear
would prevail in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Let all criminals of every shade and color know that we shall
give them no quarter; there will be no place to hide," he vowed.
</P>
<P>
"I want to dispel, once and for all, the perception that South
Africa is the crime capital of the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister had recently returned from a United Nations
conference on crime in Vienna, Austria, where the global crime
situation was discussed.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. statistics clearly showed that some countries in the
world had higher crime rates than South Africa, according to
Tshwete.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, according to the conference, some European cities
have higher crime incidence than Johannesburg," Tshwete said.
</P>
<P>
Police operations were beginning to bear fruit as the the
geographical policing strategy, carried out between March 28 and
May 11, had resulted in the arrest of 82,553 suspects, the
recovery of 3,473 stolen vehicles, and the seizure of 2,509
illegal firearms, and 38,261 kilograms of drugs, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
At a number of "priority" police stations, reductions in crime
rate of between 12 and 20 percent had been achieved, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a South African Police Service team currently
working with their Mozambican counterparts to uncover arms caches
in that country, had achieved major successes.
</P>
<P>
Large numbers of weapons, including AK-47 rifles, landmines,
plastic explosives, mortar tubes and projectiles, and even an
anti-aircraft gun, had been destroyed.

<HEADLINE> Ji Fires China into First Thomas Cup Finals of Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The second singles Ji Xinpeng
fired China into the finals of the Thomas Cup for the first time
in a decade when China outclassed South Korea 3-1 at the Putra
Stadium on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ji, the Japan Open men's singles champion, snatched the crucial
point on the third game of the tie, edging off Ahn Jae Chang 15-12,
15-10 in 53 minutes to put China into the driving 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
China, who were stopped every time in the semi-finals in the
past four versions of the biannual event after they won the 1990
edition, will meet the winners of the Friday's semi-finals clash
between Indonesia and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very glad that my players could play such a good game
under such big pressures," Chinese coach Li Yongbo said. "It's
not the result of the game itself that means a lot to us. It's the
player's consistence and confidence that will carry our team
forward."
</P>
<P>
Xia Xuanze, who won the All-England Open in March, conquered
Lee Hyun Li, the hottest singles player of the tournament, 11-6,
11-5.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who handled off Olympic champion Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen of
Denmark in the preliminary round, was expected to offer an upset
on the uncommon first singles outings. But Xia, ranked seventh in
the world, using elegant drops on the net, broke away midway into
the first and second sets to get the good of the game.
</P>
<P>
"The first singles game was very important. If Xia lost, we
could go down to 2-0 or even lost in straight games," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Yu Jinhao and Chen Qiqiu delivered a morale-boosting doubles
game although they lost to world champion Kim Dong Moon and Ha Tae
Kwon 15-11, 5-15, 15-9.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese pair produced hard time to their higher-ranked
opponents before they surrendered winning points down the strength.
Both scored 35 points in the 82-minute match in total.
</P>
<P>
Drawing 1-1 in the tie and 12-12 in the first set, Ji Xinpeng
set Ahn around with fast footsteps and powerful strikes to
conclude with a net winner following scoring three points in row
to take the set.
</P>
<P>
It was again the Chinese who found the attacking bullets first
when the rivalry was stuck at 6-6 in the second set as Ji, five
years younger than Ahn at 22, exhausted Ahn with mixtures of lobs
and short drops.
</P>
<P>
Ji's victory unloaded the pressure off Zhang Jun and Zhang Wei,
who ended up their winless records to Lee Dong Soo and Yoo Yong
Sung, winning 15-9, 12-15, 15-9. The duo of Zhang/Zhang lost in
straight sets at the Japan Open in 1999 and Asian Games in 1998 to
Lee/Yoo.
</P>
<P>
After splitting the first two sets, China led 8-0 to change the
sides first and steered up to a 15-9 win in the half-a-hour set.
</P>
<P>
"Zhang Jun and Zhang Wei knew they could finish the semi-finals
on the second doubles," Li added.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever we'll meet in the finals, Indonesia or Denmark, we'll
try our best as we did today," Li pledged.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Refutes Taiwan's "Three Principles for Dialogue" (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is the goal of the entire Chinese people to safeguard the
unification of the country and oppose separation. Those who
conflict with the trend of history and act against the people's
welfare, will eventually be cast aside by all the people,
including the Taiwanese people, says the editorial.
</P>
<P>
The editorial stresses that it is a fact recognized by the
international community that there is only one China in the world,
and Taiwan is a part of China. The government of the United States
has announced time and again that it does not support the so-
called " independence of Taiwan," "two Chinas," or "one China, one
Taiwan," and that it does not support Taiwan's membership in any
international organization which only sovereign states can join.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says that in order to ensure that cross-Straits
relations develop in a good direction, the Taiwan authorities must
abandon separatist ideas such as the "Two States Theory," admit
that Taiwan is a part of China, and no longer cause tensions or
make new troubles for the cross-Straits relations.

<TEXT>
<P>
Peaceful solution to disputes called for by the UN Charter
indicates relations between two countries, it notes, but Taiwan is
not a sovereign state, and cross-Straits relations are not
relations between two countries.
</P>
<P>
To apply the UN Charter to cross-Straits relations equals the
advocacy of "Taiwan is an independent sovereign state" and the "
Two-States Theory."
</P>
<P>
The "Two-States Theory" cannot bring peace to the Straits, but
rather will provoke disputes and create a crisis in the Straits,
it stresses.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is a part of China and Taiwan has only one future --
reunification with the mainland, the editorial emphasizes, adding
that this is a very clear and non-negotiable issue.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, reunification has long been the policy of
the Taiwan authorities, it notes.
</P>
<P>
In an official document of February 1991, the Taiwan
authorities listed " national reunification" as its goal.
</P>
<P>
But some Taiwan elements have tried to reject the reunification
policy by putting forward suggestions such as "Taiwan's future is
open-ended" and "cross-Straits dialogues should not set directions.
"
</P>
<P>
Their real motive is to reject the idea that Taiwan is a part
of China, the editorial points out.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Rains Cause Damage in Northern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Continuous heavy rains triggered by
typhoon "Biring" in the Philippines' central Luzon area Thursday
killed at least 2 people and forced nearly 700 families flee their
homes, local authorities said.
</P>
<P>
In Valenzuela city, Metro Manila, police said a mother and 17-
year-old girl were pinned to death when a perimeter wall collapsed.
</P>
<P>
Quezon city government officials said they have helped
evacuated a total of 500 families to safer areas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Manila proper, a total of 149 families were
evacuated as a river running through the city swelled. In some
areas of the city, streets were seen lying in a 3-foot-deep water
where commuters and motorists stranded in floods.
</P>
<P>
The heavy rains also triggered a landslide along a highway in
Nueva Ecija, Pampanga province, rendering it impassable to all
types of motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The heavy rains were reportedly caused by a typhoon "Biring,"
the center of which was estimated 100 kilometers west of Baguio
city in Benguet province with maximum sustained winds of 45
kilometers per hour near.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said in a radio interview
that mechanism is in place to mobilize the needed resources to
help residents affected by the rains.
</P>
<P>
"We should be thankful we have the proper mechanism in place.
We are ready to respond to disasters," said Mercado, who is also
head of the National Disaster Coordinating Council.
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned about the direct hit of typhoons. We get 20
typhoons a year, but some are very destructive," he added.

<HEADLINE> Asia-Pacific Conference on Child Soldiers Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The first-ever conference in Asia
and the Pacific on child soldiers ended here Thursday with an
urgent appeal to armed groups and government forces in the region
to stop using children under 18 in wars and conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the end of the conference, Jo Becker, chairwoman of
the conference, said the plight of child soldiers in Asia has
failed to receive the attention from governments, non-governmental
organizations (NGO and the media in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest achievement of this conference is that it has
created a regional network on this issue that will now work to
reverse this neglect," she said.
</P>
<P>
In the Kathmandu Declaration on the Use of Children as Soldiers
adopted by the conference, the about 200 delegates called upon
governments and NGOs both inside and outside the Asia-Pacific
region to take measures to stop using children in wars and armed
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
They urged governments to use their influence to restrict
supply of small arms, including lightweight weapons, which most
children can handle with ease, to areas where children are
involved in conflicts.
</P>
<P>
This should include the sanctioning of suppliers, they argued.
</P>
<P>
Condemning the use of children as soldiers by armed groups, the
declaration urged these groups to end the recruitment of children
and release children soldiers into safety.
</P>
<P>
It also asked states to ratify the new Optional Protocol to the
Convention on the Rights of the Child, which prohibits the
involvement of children under 18 in armed conflicts, and to
implement it in national laws.
</P>
<P>
The delegates also appealed for the UNICEF (United Nations
Children's Fund) and other international organizations to help
provide alternative resources to children, especially those in
marginalized areas, as" poor and socially deprived children are
the ones most likely to become soldiers."
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that more than 300,000 child soldiers are
currently being used in wars and conflicts worldwide. Asia has 75,
000 child involved in wars.
</P>
<P>
The four-day conference was co-organized by the Nepali
government and the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers,
which is made up of renowned international organizations such as
Amnesty International, Defense for Children International, World
Vision International and so on.
</P>
<P>
Participating in the conference were about 200 delegates from
20 Asia-Pacific countries including Australia, Bangladesh,
Cambodia, China India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka,
Thailand, Japan and about a dozen countries outside the region.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ambassador Seeks Understanding of Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador John C. Holzman
Thursday sought sympathy and understanding of the people of
Bangladesh for the inability of President Bill Clinton to visit
the National Memorial at Savar to pay respect to the Liberation
War martyrs because of definite and serious security threat.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters here, Holzman stressed that the scheduled
visit of President Clinton to the memorial was canceled for "
security reasons." "No country will take risk if their president's
life is at threat," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton paid a 12-hour official visit to Bangladesh
on March 20. The people and the government of the country were
shocked at the sudden cancellation of Clinton's scheduled program
to visit the National Memorial outside Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
As regards Clinton's visit to the country, the U.S. ambassador
pointed out that the president was not motivated by a grand
strategic design, "rather he came to Dhaka because Bangladesh
matters to Americans."
</P>
<P>
He described the existing bilateral relations as "excellent,"
saying "Our challenge now is to sustain the momentum, especially
as we look towards Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to
Washington later this year."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the introduction of market economy and economic
liberalization in Bangladesh, the ambassador said that Americans
see the two societies moving in the same direction, both
struggling to create more responsive democracies and production
economics based on human freedom.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question, Holzman said the U.S. government had no
desire to set up any military base in Bangladesh. Americans want
to be Bangladesh's partner in the historic efforts of ensuring a
better living to its population, he noted.

</P>
<P>
GRAND BAIE, Mauritius, May 18 (Xinhua) -- African leaders
attending the 5th Summit of the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) here have hailed the launching of the
continent's first Free Trade Area (FTA) by October 31 a milestone
in the economic integration for the 21- country sub-region, and
Africa as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"This year will be an important milestone in the history of
COMESA," said the host country Mauritius' Prime Minister
Navinchandra Ramgoolam at the three-day summit which will end on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The incoming FTA means not only the creation of the first
African FTA but also the finishing of a vital step in implementing
the strategies of Lagos Plan of Action, Final Act of Lagos and
1992 Abuja Treaty, which serve as the blueprint for a powerful
pan-African economic community, said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
History has witnessed that "the COMESA region is already a
working economic area, where most goods are moving across borders
on preferential terms," commented the COMESA's outgoing Chairman,
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi.
</P>
<P>
"At least 14 member states have published COMESA tariffs with
reductions ranging from 60 percent to 90 percent being charged for
goods originating from COMESA countries," said Moi, adding that
"most non-tariff barriers have been eliminated".
</P>
<P>
"Over the past year, it has become clear to all of us that the
creation of a large market under the COMESA Free Trade Area will
create new opportunities for our economies," said the Kenyan
president.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from attracting greater local and foreign direct
investment, the COMESA Free Trade Area will stimulate economic
integration and lead to a more conducive macro-economic climate,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Also addressing the summit, Assistant Secretary-General Vijay
Makhan of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), said "the
challenges we face in a globalizing world economy should not be
underestimated" and "African countries have virtually no other
option than to intensify their efforts at cooperation and
integration."
</P>
<P>
"It is only by adopting a common approach to find common
solutions to common problems that we will be able to make progress
in overcoming our well-known structural constraints," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"With a combined Gross Domestic Product of 170 billion U.S.
dollars and a potential market of over 200 million people, the
COMESA FTA will be a strong attraction for both domestic and
foreign investment," said Mauritius' Deputy Prime Minister
Rajkeswur Purryag addressing the ministerial meeting before the
summit.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, by dismantling trade barriers, we shall reduce costs
of production, increase our productivity so as to be able to
compete in the local and foreign markets," he said.
</P>
<P>
The incoming COMESA FTA, characterized by elimination of the
tariff and non-tariff barriers, is expected to further promote
trade among the 21 member states of the regional community. The
FTA will enable manufacturers to widen their operations in the
sub-region and help move the sub-region from a consumer of
manufactured goods to that of intermediate and capital goods.
</P>
<P>
It will serve as a catalyst for increased cross-border
investment, and lay the training ground for COMESA nations to
participate in more acute international competition.
</P>
<P>
However, the leaders also observed that their countries must
pool efforts together to solve some of the remaining sticky
problems, before reaping the benefits of the FTA.
</P>
<P>
These issues include how to reform and strengthen the member
states' comparatively weak financial systems, said Mauritius'
deputy prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
"This is essential not only to attract more investment but also
to keep us competitive in an ever-changing global financial
environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Identifying the political and commercial risks as determent for
the inflow of foreign investment, he called on the COMESA member
states to join the Regional Trade Facilitation Project, COMESA
Payment and Settlement System and the Africa Commerce Exchange,
the sub-regional institutions aimed at risk-management and banking
transfer networking.
</P>
<P>
"Another important constraint to investment and growth in our
region is the poor state of trans-border and multi-sectoral
infrastructures," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that "our efforts at regionalization must also be
supported by appropriate macro-economic convergencies, efficient
labor markets and well- functioning capital markets."
</P>
<P>
Liberalization of trade alone will not solve all the problems
in the sub- region, said Mauritius' Prime Minister Ramgoolam.
</P>
<P>
"We need therefore to steer a steady course guided by our
commitment to peace, democracy, good governance and the
alleviation of poverty," he said.

<HEADLINE> Construction of Large Steel Plant Suspended in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal
Mocumbi said Thursday here that the suspension of construction of
a huge steel plant had impacted negatively upon the government's
ambitious poverty alleviation program.
</P>
<P>
The project, which cost two billion U.S. dollars, was suspended
due to capital shortage caused by the withdrawal of a major
partner, the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
But the prime minister also disclosed that Enron Southern
Africa Development Corporation, the American partner of the
project, had started looking for a new partner in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Despite the suspension of the key project in his government's
poverty alleviation program, the prime minister said however the
other two key projects in the program still went well.
</P>
<P>
They are the building of a expressway linking the country's
capital Maputo with South Africa, Mozambique's rich neighbor, and
a aluminum plant.
</P>
<P>
The two projects cost 900 million dollars and 1.4 billion
dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique, one of the world's poorest countries with a annual
per capita national income of only 100 dollars, launched the
troika program several years ago with an aim to boost its economic
development.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Refutes Taiwan's "Three Principles for Dialog" (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article says that the problem of the status of the two
sides of the Taiwan Straits in conducting dialogs, and the problem
of peacefully resolving differences, are fundamental problems that
must be resolved in developing cross-Straits relations.
</P>
<P>
As the new authorities in Taiwan are about to announce their
future policies, there are some people in Taiwan advocating the "
Two States Theory." Because of this, the editorial says, "It is
necessary for us to clearly state our views."
</P>
<P>
"We maintain consistently achieving national reunification by
conducting negotiations between the two sides of the Straits as
equals. Under the one China principle, the two sides can
undoubtedly find the proper means for conducting talks as equals,"
it says.
</P>
<P>
"Considering requests made by the Taiwan authorities that
negotiations be conducted as equals, we have never used the term '
central to local government' as a term describing talks and
negotiations between the two sides," it says.
</P>
<P>
In fact, since 1992, the talks and negotiations between the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits and the Taiwan-
based Strait Exchange Foundation have been conducted on an equal
basis, the editorial went on to say.
</P>
<P>
"We should say, conducting negotiations as equals is no problem,
" the article points out.
</P>
<P>
While refusing to accept the one China principle, some people
in Taiwan demanded that the mainland should recognize the equal
status of Taiwan. This remark is actually Lee Teng-hui's "Two
States Theory," it says.

<HEADLINE> Tang-Style Nunnery Reopened in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Chi Lin Nunnery, a Tang
Dynasty-style architecture covering over 33,000 square meters, has
added a new landmark to Hong Kong, said a senior Hong Kong
official Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Chi Lin Nunnery, set up in 1930s, was a religious and
cultural treasure in its own right, said Anson Chan, Chief
Secretary for Administration of Hong Kong, at a ceremony marking
the nunnery's reopening to the public after redevelopment of about
10 years at a cost of over 700 million HK dollars (90 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The design and layout of the nunnery was a combination of
ancient architecture and modern technology, she said.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure that the Hong Kong Tourist Association and the Home
Affairs Department will join hands with the monastery's management
in presenting Chi Lin to both the local and overseas community to
showcase Hong Kong's attractiveness and cultural diversity," she
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Chan noted that the Tang Dynasty was a period of remarkable
national strength and economic success in China, which saw the
merging of different cultures and races.
</P>
<P>
"This Tang style nunnery is, therefore, a fitting reflection of
today's Hong Kong as an international city in Asia where East
meets West," she said.
</P>
<P>
Chan also praised the Chi Lin Nunnery for its contribution in
the provision of social and educational services.
</P>
<P>
The Chi Lin Nunnery has 16 halls for various religious
functions with a lotus pond garden at its first entrance. Apart
from the religious structure, the Nunnery also operates a home for
the elderly, a care and attention home, as well as schools.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Negotiator Demands Release of Palestinian Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian chief negotiator for the
interim phase, Saeb Erekat, on Thursday re-asserted the demand that
the Palestinian detainees in Israeli jails be released before
resuming the interim stage negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Voice Of Palestine radio, Erekat said
the interim negotiations will not be resumed unless the Israeli
side responds to the Palestinian stance over the release of the
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The issues of the interim stage include the release of
Palestinian prisoners, opening up the northern safe passage between
Gaza Strip and the West Bank, economic cooperation and the last
stage of Israeli pullout.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has repeatedly demanded the release of 230
Palestinian prisoners but was rejected by Israel, which said it had
carried out all its commitments regarding prisoners under signed
interim deals.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Erekat rejected a reported Israeli plan, carried by
the Israeli daily "Maarev," to set up autonomous Palestinian
housing areas in Jerusalem under the Israeli sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Erekat said the discussion
with Israel about the status of Jerusalem is concentrated on
sovereignty, not on administrative authorities.
</P>
<P>
The final-status negotiations, which deals thorny issues like
Jerusalem, borders, refugees, settlements and water, are expected
to be resumed Thursday in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
Erekat added that the Palestinian side will not attend the
security meetings with Brig. Gen. Shlomo Oren, commander of Israeli
forces in the West Bank, in protest to his alleged threats of
bombing the headquarters of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in the
West Bank city of Ramallah if Palestinians did not stop shooting at
Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Violent clashes erupted between the Palestinians and the Israeli
forces since last week due to the issue of the prisoners. The
clashes caused the death of six Palestinians, injuring about 1,000
Palestinian protestors as well as dozens of Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The tension has eased off in all Palestinian cities, but
confrontations still existed in some areas in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen on Priorities of Second Five-Year Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen
Thursday said that the Second Five-Year Plan should become the
most important instrument to achieve the government's ultimate
goal of poverty reduction and improving the living standards of
millions of people, especially those living in the rural area.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen made the remarks at a national workshop on preparation
of the Second Socio-economic Development Plan 2001-2005 held at
the Inter-Continental Hotel.
</P>
<P>
The three main objectives put forward by Hun Sen for the
government's poverty reduction strategy are:
</P>
<P>
-- Long-term, sustainable economic growth at the annual rate of
6 to 7 percent;
</P>
<P>
-- Equitable distribution of the fruits of economic growth
between the haves and the have-nots, between urban and rural areas
and between the two opposite sexes;
</P>
<P>
-- Ensure sustainable management and utilization of the
environment and natural resources.
</P>
<P>
"This is a large-scale war requiring sacrifices and joint
efforts with strong will and determination," the prime minister
stressed, adding "the Second Five-Year Plan should be our compass
and tool in this important battle."
</P>
<P>
Despite the recent improvement in economic performance,
Cambodia is still one of the poorest countries in the world with
GDP per capita estimated at only 280 U.S. dollars in 1998. An
estimated 36 percent of the population is poor measured by a
poverty line, and rural households, especially those for whom
agriculture is the primary source of income, account for almost 90
percent of the poor.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister requested all ministries and agencies
concerned to cooperate and coordinate closely to ensure the
success of the preparation and implementation of the government
plan.

<HEADLINE> HK Economy Recovering From Asian Financial Crisis: EU Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong economy is gradually
recovering from the effects of the Asian financial crisis with
trade deficit narrowed and re-exports increased, a European Union
report said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report, the second annual report by the European Commission
on Hong Kong, said that Hong Kong still remains one of the freest
societies in Asia and Hong Kong people are running Hong Kong and
doing so effectively.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
bloc, said after approving the report on Thursday that the "one
country, two systems" principle is generally working well.
</P>
<P>
The fact that EU companies continued to invest heavily in Hong
Kong demonstrated their confidence in Hong Hong's future, the
report added.
</P>
<P>
The report said that in the second quarter of 1999 Hong Kong
emerged from 15 months of recession while other economic
indicators also showed positive trends during the past year.
</P>
<P>
It added that the Hong Kong stock market prices recovered their
July 1997 level and unemployment was stabilized.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's market economy continues to operate in very much
the same manner as it did before the handover (of Hong Kong to
China)," said the report.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission cited as two major economic events in
the past year the liberalization of the financial markets through
the demutualization, merger and listing of the securities and
futures exchanges and the first steps taken to dispose of the
stock portfolio that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
authorities acquired in the summer of 1998 to intervene against
the speculation on the stock and currency markets.

<HEADLINE> Round-Up: Agreement Paves Way for Inter-Korean Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The agreement signed Thursday on
procedures for the inter-Korean summit has paved the way for next
month's historic meeting between South Korean President Kim Dae-
jung and Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) leader Kim
Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
The 15-point agreement was signed at the fifth preparatory
meeting between delegates from Seoul and Pyongyang which was held
in the Peace House of the truce village of Panmunjom.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came 26 days after the marathon preparatory talks
in Panmunjom began on April 22.
</P>
<P>
Special envoys from Seoul and Pyongyang reached an accord in
Beijing on April 8 this year for the summit slated to open in
Pyongyang on June 12-14.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's agreement is seen as the second one for an inter-
Korean summit since the Korean Peninsula was divided half a
century ago.
</P>
<P>
Then South Korean President Kim Young-sam and the late DPRK
President Kim Il Sung agreed to meet in July 1994, but the summit
failed to open due to the latter's sudden death.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's agreement is also seen as a result of compromise and
cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The agreement sets the size of the South Korean delegation to
the summit at 130 people, 30 more than that agreed upon during the
1994 summit preparations.
</P>
<P>
The size of the press corps was agreed at 50 reporters, down
from Seoul's original demand of 80, but up from 40 that Pyongyang
insisted in the past four preparatory talks.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong Il will meet at
least two or three times and more if necessary.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will neither hoist national flags nor attach any
markings at the conference venue and lodging places.
</P>
<P>
Kim Dae-jung and his entourage can use "land or air routes" to
Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
On the summit agenda, the two sides agreed that the summit will
reconfirm the three principles of national reunification expressed
in the historic July 4 South-North Joint Statement to realize
reconciliation and consolidation, exchanges and cooperation and
peace and unification.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the agreement reached Thursday, South Korean
top delegate Yang Young-shik spoke highly of the agreement at a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
"The adoption and effectuation of the agreement will serve as a
cornerstone in smoothing the path to the meeting of the two
leaders that will open doors to an age of reconciliation,
cooperation, peace and prosperity," said Yang, who is also vice
unification minister.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, DPRK chief delegate Kim Song Ryong said the two
sides should sincerely implement it and make the summit successful
to meet the expectation and desire of the Koreans.
</P>
<P>
"We will try to make the historic meeting and the summit talks
in Pyongyang successful, based on the agreement on procedural
matters," Kim said.

<HEADLINE> Four Killed as Greek Jet Fighter Crashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Four people, including two teenagers,
were killed Thursday as a Greek Air Force jet fighter crashed into
a house in a village, northwest of Athens, the second jet crash in
72 hours.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after taking off from a nearby air base for a routine
training flight, the two-seat F-4 fighter plane crashed into a two-
story house and burst into flames, killing both the pilot and co-
pilot, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Two girls, aged between 15 and 16, were also burnt to death
while they were at home studying.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday , a Greek fighter-bomber, A-7 Corsair, crashed
shortly after taking off from the Hania airport in the southern
Greek island of Crete, and the pilot, who was seriously injured,
had been transferred to an Athens military hospital, but died
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It is also the third jet crash for the Greek Air Force this
year. In January, a F-4 jet plane crashed during a training flight
over the central Greek islands of Eubia and Skyros, and both
pilots were lost in the crash.
</P>
<P>
Greece has lost more than 70 planes and 40 pilots in training
accidents since 1987.

<HEADLINE> Website For China's Construction Projects Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A website for China's massive
construction projects was formally launched here today.
</P>
<P>
The website: SinoProjects.com, was jointly developed by the
Canadian company AEA International Business Network, the China
Construction Industry Association, and the computer center of the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
Officials with the State Development Planning Commission, the
Ministry of Construction and MOFTEC, as well as Canadian
ambassador to China, Howard Balloch, attended a press conference
in Beijing to launch the website.
</P>
<P>
At present, China has the world's largest construction market,
with funds for capital construction surpassing one trillion yuan (
about 120 billion U.S. dollars) annually in recent years, said
Wang Xiaoying, director of the Information Exchange Center of the
China Construction Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
For years, Chinese projects have been short of funds,
technology, equipment and professionals. Now, by accessing the
website, international partners will be able to find opportunities
to invest and supply equipment and technology, and professionals
will be able to search for jobs in the field.
</P>
<P>
"The website is a bridge between the two sides," said Henry
Wang, CEO of AEA International Business Network Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The company has liaison offices for customers in New York,
Toronto, Vancouver, London, Hong Kong, and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, China had more than 15,000 websites, and
the number is increasing rapidly.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said today that China welcomes the voting
results on granting China the Permanent Normal Trade Relations (
PNTR) status in the Finance Committee of the U.S. Senate and the
Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Mutual granting of PNTR status is the basis of the bilateral
agreement China and the U.S. have reached concerning China's
accession into the World Trade Organization, as well as the
prerequisite to carrying out the agreement, Zhang said at a
regular press conference.
</P>
<P>
She reiterated that the settlement of the PNTR issue will help
China and the United States to carry out trade and economic
cooperation in a comprehensive way on the basis of equality and
mutual-benefit.
</P>
<P>
The granting of PNTR status will also create condition for the
long-term healthy and stable development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Zhang urged the far-sighted personnel in the U.S. Congress to
adopt a wise attitude to resolve the PNTR issue as soon as
possible, pointing out that "it is in the interest of both
countries."
</P>
<P>
In light of the "inauguration" of newly-elected Taiwan leader
Chen Shui-bian on May 20 and reports that some foreign governments
have decided to send special envoys on the occasion, Zhang urged
them to respect China's sovereignty and honor their relevant
commitments.

"We hope that countries concerned will respect this fact that
is recognized by most countries in the world, and do nothing that
will hurt the feelings of the Chinese people," she said.
</P>
<P>
As to reports that Japan's Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara is
to attend the "inauguration ceremony", Zhang reiterated that the
Japanese government should honor its commitments and statements on
the Taiwan issue, and stop politicians like Shintaro Ishihara from
interfering in China's internal affairs, so as not to undermine
the development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
On Philippine President Joseph Estrada's visit here, she said,
both countries reiterated that they would settle disputes on the
South China Sea through friendly consultation.
</P>
<P>
China holds that it has indisputable sovereignty over the South
China Sea and adjacent waters, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
China has always insisted on peacefully settling disputes
through bilateral negotiation, in line with principles and legal
regulations in universally-recognized international laws and the
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
</P>
<P>
If some disputes could not be settled for the time being, then
the principle of common exploration and reserving disputes should
be followed, she added.

Zhang referred to the No. 1298 UN resolution, which, passed on
May 17, will impose a 12-month arms embargo on both countries.
</P>
<P>
The embargo will be lifted on condition that the UN secretary-
general hand over a report on peaceful settlement of the conflict
between the two countries, it is learnt.
</P>
<P>
Zhang expressed the hope that the two countries will resolve
their problems through peaceful means as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question concerning the report that the new
Japanese prime minister apologized for his recent nationalist
remarks but did not withdraw them, Zhang said that Japan should
draw lessons from history and should not follow the same old
disastrous road.
</P>
<P>
"Japan should continue to take the road of peace and
development it has pursued since the end of World War II," she
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Green Belts Benefit Satellite-launching Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The green belts surrounding the
Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center have successfully protected the
center from the sandstorm assaults which have hit north and
northwestern China more than 10 times this year.
</P>
<P>
The satellite center, on the edge of the desert in northwest
China's Gansu Province, was known for its formidable "no
vegetation, no water" environment when it was founded in 1958.
</P>
<P>
Since 1958, generations of workers there have devoted
themselves to the beautification of this satellite-launching city.
They not only have discovered water deep down in the sand, but
also constructed a 2.5 sq. km artificial lake in the vicinity.
Moreover, they made painstaking efforts to plant trees and grass
around the city.
</P>
<P>
To date, the center has planted a total of 300 hectares of
forest belts, and the vegetation coverage has risen from zero to
61 percent.
</P>
<P>
These belts have played an important role in fighting this year
's sandstorms which have frequently inundated neighboring areas.
</P>
<P>
The green belts have also drawn many wild animals and birds,
including some rare species, to live in this desert-turned-oasis
city.
</P>
<P>
The Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center is one of China's satellite-
launching bases, and the "Shenzhou" spacecraft of the country's
manned space flight program was launched there on November 20 last
year.

<HEADLINE> Iraq's Oil Exports to Go Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraq is expected to export some 350
million barrels of crude oil under the current phase of the U.N.
oil-for-food program due to an increase in its oil production, said
a
source at the Iraqi Oil Ministry on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has endorsed over 100 contracts with Arab and other
countries under the current seventh phase of the U.N. oil-for-food
deal, which is scheduled to end on June 10 this year.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the contracts were signed with Russian, French
and Chinese firms, said the source.
</P>
<P>
However, he reiterated that Iraq gives preferential treatments
to Arab and friendly countries concerning the contracts for
exporting Iraqi oil.
</P>
<P>
During the previous six phases of the U.N. humanitarian program,
Iraq signed more than 400 oil contracts with other countries and
exported 1.5 billion barrels of crude oil, according to the source.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has exported crude oil valued at 24 billion U.S. dollars
since the U.N. oil-for-food program was launched in late 1996.
</P>
<P>
The program is an exemption to the crippling U.N. economic
sanctions imposed against Iraq since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The program allows Iraq to sell a certain amount of oil every
six months to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies
for its people, as well as to pay reparations stemming from the
1991 Gulf War, during which the U.S.-led multi-national forces
drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.

LAGOS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Army Chief, Major General
Victor Malu, Thursday recommended tough military approach for the
disarmament and demobilization of the Revolutionary United Front
(RUF) rebels as key to the restoration of peace in the war-torn
west African country.
</P>
<P>
Malu, a former commander of the west African peacekeeping

Nigerian capital Abuja, where he is attending an emergency meeting

Malu, who led the ECOMOG forces that restored peace to Liberia,
said that "we (ECOMOG) did it before in Liberia and I don't see
why it cannot be done in Sierra Leone," he said, adding the same
level of military and political commitment and determination was
essential to achieve success in the crisis-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations peacekeeping forces in Sierra Leone, who
replaced the ECOMOG last month, have run into trouble with the RUF
rebels, which took hostage of about 500 UN peacekeepers early May.

work in partnership with the UN forces or operate independently.
</P>
<P>
Diop said the heads of state of the ECOWAS are expected to
urgently make a decision through consultation on any of the three
options when the troops are to be deployed.
</P>
<P>
Currently, three west African countries, namely Nigeria, Ghana
and Guinea have some six battalions of troops serving with
UNAMSIL, which replaced the west African peacekeeping forces,
known as ECOMOG, last month in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Diop also explained that some ECOWAS countries also pledged
equipment and logistic support for the redeployment of ECOMOG to
Sierra Leone, where it had helped to restore President Tejan
Kabbah in 1997 after he was ousted by the rebel Revolutionary
United Front led by Foday Sankoh.

<HEADLINE> Forest Fire in Germany Causes Bigger Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A forest fire, which started
Wednesday nearby Berlin in the state of Brandenburg in eastern
Germany, has caused enormous losses to the state.
</P>
<P>
About 50 hectares of pines forest had been burned out in the
county of Dahme-Spreewald, and the economic loss has reached a
height of 750,000 U.S. dollars, said a report released Thursday by
the bureau for forestry of Koenigs Wusterhausen.
</P>
<P>
The reason of the forest fire was the munitions of the World
War II in the county.
</P>
<P>
About 500 fire fighters had taken part in the fire-
extinguishing operation for 6 hours on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The fire, which was described as the biggest one this year so
far, had been under control early Wednesday evening.

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Urges America to Keep Troops in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The chief of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) urged the United States Thursday to
keep its troops in Kosovo after July.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General George Robertson said in a letter sent
to the U.S. Senate that a NATO ally unilaterally setting a
deadline for pulling out NATO's Kosovo operation risked sending a
signal that the western military alliance is divided.
</P>
<P>
The Briton said in the letter that he was deeply concerned
about the possibility that the struggle between U.S. Republicans
and the White House results in a U.S. withdrawal from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate is scheduled to vote Thursday on a proposal of
withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Yugoslav province by July 1,
2001 unless the U.S. Congress expressly authorizes their stay
there.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday backed the
effort to require the withdrawal of American troops from Kosovo
next year unless NATO allies meet their aid commitments.
</P>
<P>
The requirement for withdrawal was voted 264-153 to pass in the
House of Representatives which saw 67 Democrats broke ranks to
vote against the Clinton Administration.
</P>
<P>
The House measure will now require U.S. President Bill Clinton
to certify by April 1 next year that NATO allies have met their
commitments for funding police, reconstruction and humanitarian
aid in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Without certification, U.S. funds could only be spent in Kosovo
on an orderly withdrawal of the 5,900 American troops from the
multinational peacekeeping force led by NATO.
</P>
<P>
The Americans have been criticizing their European NATO allies
for lagging behind in providing financial aid in funding United
Nations programs in Kosovo and in financing the reconstruction
projects of Kosovo after the 78-day NATO bombing campaign against
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia last year.

KUALA LUMPUR, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Football
Confederation has banned Saudi Arabian club Al Ahli for one year

<HEADLINE> Funds Secured for Western Projects: Development Planning Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- China expected to start ten
projects this year as a prelude developing China's western regions.
These projects have secured funds from central and local
governments, enterprises, banks and overseas investors, a State
Development Planning official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Song Mi, director of the Department of Basic Industries of the
State Development Planning Commission (SDPC), said at a press
conference here today that the central government will increase
investment in central and western areas this year, especially in
infrastructure projects such as railways, highways, and airports.
</P>
<P>
The ten projects include the construction of the 955-km-long Xi
'an-Hefei section of the Xi'an-Nanjing railway, and the 640-km-
long Chongqing-Huaihua railway, with an investment of 23.2 billion
yuan and 18.2 billion yuan respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, China will also build several trunk
highways, an airport in Xi'an, the capital of Shaanxi Province,
and build a light rail in Chongqing Municipality to improve urban
transportation.
</P>
<P>
A 953-km-long gas pipeline will be built to link the Qaidam
Basin, a place rich in natural gas and crude oil from Xining, the
capital of Qinghai Province, to Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu
Province. The pipeline will have the capacity to move two billion
cubic meters of natural gas annually.
</P>
<P>
Two flood-control projects to be built in Sichuan Province and
the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region will have multiple functions
including electricity-generating and irrigation. The two projects
are expected to cost about 7.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
As a major part of developing China's western regions, 340,000
hectares of farm land along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River
and Yellow River will be reconverted into forest or pasture, while
over 430,000 hectares of waste land and hills will be reafforested.
</P>
<P>
The ten projects also include the building of a potash
fertilizer plant in Qinghai and building schools and improving
higher education.
</P>
<P>
Investment by enterprises and local governments will serve as
important source of funding the ten projects, Song Mi said.
</P>
<P>
While infrastructure and the environment have been earmarked in
developing China's western regions, industrial projects will also
be approved in improving economic development in central and
western areas, Song said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Have More Choices When Making Long-Distance Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- People in north China's Tianjin
Municipality today began to have another choice when making a long-
distance phone call, namely, China Unicom.
</P>
<P>
By dialing "193" first on local-call-only telephones, and then
the long-distance phone number, people can access the new long-
distance call service. China Unicom's involvement means an end to
the China Telecom's monopoly in the field.
</P>
<P>
To abide by the regulations of the Ministry of Information
Industry, during its first four months, China Unicom will carry
out preferential phone call charges. Calls within 800 km will be 0.
6 yuan (about 7.2 US cents) per minute, and those further than 800
km will be charged at 0.8 yuan per minute.
</P>
<P>
Also, these charges will be 50 percent off during 21:00 to 7:00
weekdays, and all day on weekends and holidays, said managers with
China Unicom (Tianjin) Corp.
</P>
<P>
Though IP card phone call service has in some way challenged
China Telecom with only 0.3 yuan per minute, more rivals are
needed to really spur market competition and benefit customers.
</P>
<P>
China Unicom has also opened the service in 23 other Chinese
cities including Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Chongqing, and
is expected to expand to a total of 128 cities nationwide within
the year, said China Unicom managers.
</P>
<P>
China Unicom also is now dealing in mobile phone calls, paging,
and local call services.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Stocks Fall Over 3 Pct at Six-Month Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong stocks plummeted 505.21
points, or 3.41 percent, to close at 14,322.60 on Thursday,
falling at their lowest levels in six months and renewing concerns
over the impact of higher interest rates in the region's economic
recovery.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's turnover was 17.907 billion HK dollars (2.296
billion U.S. dollars), 5.240 billion HK dollars (673 million U.S.
dollars) more than the 12.667 billion HK dollars (1.623 billion U.
S. dollars) in the previous trading session.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believed that fears of U.S. interest rates being
nowhere near their peak drove Asian stock market lower on Thursday,
while a shift in Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) index
weightings hit Hong Kong badly.
</P>
<P>
Asian stocks generally followed Wall Street and the Nasdaq down
after the U.S. Federal Reserve indicated inflation, the main
target of its relentless series of recent rate rises, was still a
top concern despite this week's latest half percent hike, the
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Trading in Hong Kong stock market was complicated by news of
changes in the series of merging markets index weightings, a
benchmark for fund portfolios which control hundreds of billions
of dollars worldwide.
</P>
<P>
This was partly due to the shock removal of blue-chip Cheung
Kong from the MSCI Hong Kong index, which was down 12 percent at
one point as index-driven funds dumped the stock to adjust
portfolio weightings.
</P>
<P>
Property developer Cheung Kong was hit hard, closing down 8.78
percent at 72.75 HK dollars (9.32 U.S. dollars) after trading at
as low as 70.25 HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
Traders said that it is being heavily sold as investors
rebalance their property exposure by switching from Cheung Kong
and buying Henderson Land, one of six companies added to the MSCI
Hong Kong index.
</P>
<P>
Sub-indices of Finance, Utilities, Properties and Commerce and
Industry all were down 2.23 percent, 2.51 percent, 4.99 percent
and 3.69 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Market sentiment was also depressed by continued heavy selling
of Hang Seng Index benchmark China Telecom, which ended 6.94
percent lower on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The China-related index ended higher with the Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index up 2.58 percent and lower with the Hang Seng
China-Affiliated Corp Index down 2.54 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng IT Index and the Hang Seng IT Portfolio Index
plunged 3.84 percent and 1.29 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong stocks plunged 514.08 points, or 3.47 percent, to
close Thursday's morning session at 14,313.73. The benchmark Hang

<HEADLINE> China Speeds Up Housing Reform in Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- China is carrying out housing
reforms in its enterprises by commercializing housing allocation
instead of distributing houses as a form of welfare.
</P>
<P>
Presently, houses owned by various enterprises account for 70
percent of China's total in urban areas. These are being sold to
workers and staff.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official with the Ministry of
Construction, workers and staff in enterprises may enjoy
preferential treatment when they buy houses by using subsidies,
public housing funds or loans.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises may develop their own ways to encourage workers
and staff to buy publicly-owned houses by taking into account the
interests of the State, enterprises, and workers and staff which
should be implemented in line with the central government's
housing reform policy.

<HEADLINE> Book on Insurance Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- An inauguration ceremony was held
today at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing for a book on
insurance that has been specially published for leading officials.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin has inscribed the title for the
book, "A Reader on Insurance for Leading Officials".
</P>
<P>
Jiang urged officials at all levels to take the lead in
learning the basics of insurance, studying relevant theories, and
strengthening the insurance management.
</P>
<P>
He added that insurance should play a greater role in China's
opening-up and reform drive and in the development of socialist
modernization.
</P>
<P>
"Finance is the core of modern economy, and insurance is a key
part of finance," Jiang said, adding that insurance is essential
to reforms, economic development, social stability, and the
welfare of the people.
</P>
<P>
"China's insurance industry is only at its infancy and we must
popularize knowledge of insurance and increase people's awareness,
" he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Chief Editor Ma Yongwei said that this is another important
financial book following "A Reader on Finance for Leading
Officials" and "A Reader on Securities".
</P>
<P>
Ma, chairman of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC)
, said that the book follows Deng Xiaoping Theory and includes
basic know-how about commercial insurance and answers numerous
insurance questions for leading officials and the people.
</P>
<P>
With the fast development of the insurance industry and
insurance management reforms, the Chinese people have now
elementary understanding on insurance, but their knowledge should
still develop further, Ma noted.
</P>
<P>
The book is divided into ten sections and includes the role of
insurance, insurance contracts, property insurance and life
insurance.

<HEADLINE> Official Calls for Faster Development of Insurance Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- China's insurance industry should
grow more rapidly, despite great achievements made in recent years,
a high official noted here today.
</P>
<P>
Ma Yongwei, chairman of the China Insurance Regulatory
Commission (CIRC), said that the insurance sector is still in its
initial development stage and cannot cater to the urgent demand of
reform and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
China's insurance business lags far behind developed countries
and some developing nations in terms of business scale, management
ability and impact on the economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
The development of the insurance industry is now prompted by
central government policies that support reforms on housing, care
for the elderly, medical care, enterprises, the upgrading of
technology, and developing China's western regions, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that existing insurance businesses cannot meet the
diversified demands of the public. The industry will also face new
challenges and opportunities after China joins the World Trade
Organization, he added.
</P>
<P>
China's insurance income soared to 139.32 billion yuan in 1999
from only 460 million yuan in 1980, with an annual increase of 35.
1 percent.
</P>
<P>
There are 28 insurance companies in China, compared to only one
when the country started economic reforms and the opening-up drive
in 1979.

<HEADLINE> China to Allow Foreign Investment in Treasury Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- China will allow foreign investors
to buy and sell treasury bonds in the country, a government
official said today.
</P>
<P>
Xia Zhihua, deputy director of the State Debts and Finance
Department under the Ministry of Finance, made the remarks at the
China Financial Industry Reforms International Summit 2000 held
here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government will internationalize the
country's treasury bond market by selectively allowing some
foreign financial institutions to underwrite treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
He said that the process of opening the treasury bond market
will take time and depend on the government's macro-economic plan
and the maturity of the treasury bond market.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance has selected a group of Chinese
financial institutions as designated underwriters of treasury
bonds since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Xia said that this move is designed to increase the efficiency
of issuing treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is asking the legislature to approve
only the budget deficit or balance of debts rather than the quota
of treasury bond issuance every year, according to Xia.
</P>
<P>
He said that China will launch over-the-counter trade of
treasury bonds for corporate investors in the second half of this
year. The move is aimed to expand the size of the inter-bank
market of treasury bonds.

<HEADLINE> More Children to be Born in China this Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A baby boom seems to be unavoidable
this year, because large numbers of people got married on the eve
of new millennium and many decided to have children shortly
afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from major hospitals in Nanjing, capital of east
China's Jiangsu Province, show that the number of pregnant women
surged in the first four months of the year.
</P>
<P>
The reason is that many young people wanted to have "cross-
century wedding." Others believe that children born this year, or
the Year of the Dragon, will be blessed, according to the Shanghai-
based Jiefang (Liberation) Daily.
</P>
<P>
The number of people who took pre-nuptial tests at the Nanjing
Women and Children Health Care Center reached 57,162 last year, an
increase of more than 7,000 compared with the figure in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Pregnant women who came to see doctors at the Women and
Children Health Care Center also increased by 32 percent in the
January-April period from the same period last year, and the
number of lying-in women at the center also reached 2,043, up 30
percent.

<HEADLINE> Scientist Finds Possible Cure for Liver Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A 29-year-old scientist at the No.1
Hospital of the Harbin Medical University in northeast China has
found that arsenic may be a possible cure for liver cancer.
</P>
<P>
During research for his doctoral thesis, Liu Lianxin used an
advanced technique of molecular biology to observe the changes of
588 genes in the liver. He said that the possibility of liver
cancer can be judged through monitoring one of the genes, and how
many years a liver cancer patient can survive can be told through
changes in another of the genes.
</P>
<P>
The research finding is very important for the early diagnosis
and treatment of liver cancer, according to today's "China Youth
Daily".
</P>
<P>
Liu's thesis also disclosed that small amounts of arsenic can "
kill" liver cancer tumor cells.
</P>
<P>
Arsenic has already been used to treat blood cancer and some
other malignant tumors. Liu's thesis has shown that arsenic may be
used as an effective medicine in treating liver cancer as well.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Stresses Quake Monitoring, Disaster Prevention (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TANGSHAN (Hebei Province), May 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-
Premier Wen Jiabao has stressed that governments at all levels
should pay attention to earthquake disaster prevention and relief,
and that earthquake monitoring and forecasting should be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national conference on earthquake disaster
prevention and relief, which was held here from May 12 to 14, Wen
said that more efforts should be made to improve earthquake
monitoring and forecasts, earthquake disaster prevention and
emergency rescues so that human and economic losses will be
reduced once earthquakes strike.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 50 years, China has achieved notable progress in
preventing earthquake disasters and relief work, which has played
an important role in the country's socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
So far, earthquake monitoring networks have been established at
national, provincial and regional levels, and monitoring stations
have been set up across the nation, Wen said.
</P>
<P>
Legal build-up in the field has also recorded progress. The
country has already promulgated a number of earthquake-related
laws and regulations, such as the law on precautions against
earthquakes and disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, earthquake disaster prevention technologies
have been widely adopted in the country's new buildings.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier also noted that Chinese scientists have worked
hard and achieved a lot of breakthroughs in earthquake monitoring
and forecasts, which has helped to greatly reduce the loss of
human life and economic losses.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Toll of Marine Disasters in China Last Year: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 700 people were killed or
still missing during last year's disastrous tidal storms, tidal
waves and red tides in Chinese waters, a government official said
today.
</P>
<P>
In an evaluation report on marine disasters in 1999, Wang Fei,
director of the Marine Environmental Protection Department of the
State Oceanic Administration, said tidal storms in 1999 caused a
total of 600 million U.S. dollars in direct economic losses and
sank 65 ships.
</P>
<P>
Two killer ocean surges were reported last year, including one
with 93 people killed or missing in Fujian Province, east China.
</P>
<P>
During the ocean surge that hit Fujian on October 9 last year,
2,995 boats were damaged, and a total of 480 million U.S. dollars
in direct economic losses was reported. The marine farming
industry in the province also dealt a heavy blow.
</P>
<P>
A June 6 ocean surge off the coast of Guangdong Province, south
China, caused huge tides of up to six meters high, resulting in
widespread destruction to marine farming and fishing industries.
</P>
<P>
Six boats were sunk, 120 damaged and a total of 96 million U.S.
dollars in direct economic loss was reported.
</P>
<P>
The biggest fatal marine incident was the sinking of the Dashun
passenger-cargo ship on November 24, 1999, which left 280 people
dead or missing off the coast of Shandong Province, east China.

<HEADLINE> Report on China's Marine Environment Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A report on China's marine
environment was released here today after a three-year survey by
about 1,200 experts in China.
</P>
<P>
The report, titled "The Bulletin on the Quality of China's
Marine Environment at the End of the 20 Century", says the trend
of deteriorating China's marine environment is yet to be brought
under effect control.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted during 1997 to 1999, covers 2.86 million
square kilometers of seas under Chinese jurisdiction, with the
exception of the areas close to Taiwan, said Wang Fei, director of
the Marine Environmental Protection Department of the State
Oceanic Administration.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, rapid economic development in China's
coastal areas during the past two decades have exerted unbearable
pressure on the nation's marine environment.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, a total of four billion tons of industrial waste water
was pumped into the sea by coastal enterprises, 19.9 percent of
the total industrial discharged across the country.
</P>
<P>
The report lists the provinces of Guangdong, Zhejiang, Liaoning
and Shanghai as the biggest polluters in coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
The report involves almost all aspects of marine environment,
such as the sources of marine pollution, sediment environment and
marine life.

<P>
However, some problems still exist in the monitor of
earthquakes and disaster relief which falls behind China's
modernization drive, the vice-premier said.
</P>
<P>
In some places, government officials have not paid enough
attention to the work of earthquake monitoring and disaster relief.
The public knows little about earthquake disaster prevention, and
buildings in some areas are not strong enough to combat
earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
While outlining the guiding principle of earthquake disaster
prevention and relief, the vice-premier stressed that major
efforts should be put on earthquake disaster prevention.
</P>
<P>
Earthquake monitoring and forecasts, especially the short-term
forecasts in population-intensive regions, economically developed
areas and places that are most vulnerable to earthquake should be
further strengthened, Wen said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, measures should be taken to build up a capable
emergency rescue system that responds quickly to the needs of
those in disaster-hit areas, the vice-premier said.
</P>
<P>
During the conference, held in Tangshan where a strong quake
claimed more than 200,000 lives in 1976, delegates from various
regions and departments exchanged views and experiences in
earthquake disaster prevention and relief. They also visited the
Anti-Earthquake Museum and anti-earthquake buildings in the city.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Peacekeeper Injured in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A Fijian solider with the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) was injured Thursday
morning in Israeli raids near the Fijian military camp in the
western sector of south Lebanon, a UNIFIL spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army (SLA) had warned UNIFIL
not to move any military vehicle in the Israeli-occupied zone on
Thursday or it will be attacked without any warning, he added.
</P>
<P>
The 4,500-strong UNIFIL was deployed in southern Lebanon under
the U.N. Security Council Resolution 426 in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, SLA, funded and trained by Israel, admitted that two
of its militiamen were killed and five others wounded in the
attacks launched by Lebanese guerrillas on the outpost of Bayada,
which was held by Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese security sources disclosed that tensions between
Hezbollah guerrillas and the forces of Israel and its proxy militia
SLA escalated in the central and western sectors of south Lebanon
on Thursday morning. The clashes have led to the injuries of four
civilians.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government last month formally informed the United
Nations of its decision to pull out Israeli troops from south
Lebanon by July, with or without a peace agreement with Lebanon and
its major power broker Syria.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its northern border from
cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Hezbollah, or Party of God, with the backing of Iran
and Syria, has been spearheading a guerrilla war to oust Israeli
troops and SLA militia from the country.

<HEADLINE> Food Aid Reaches Southern Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A large convoy carrying
commercial supplies and food aid from the World Food Program of
the United Nations has reached Baidoa town, in southern Somalia,
Thursday morning through the dangerous and closed Mogadishu-Baidoa
road.
</P>
<P>
According to officials from the local food aid delivery
contractors, the WFP stock on 26 heavy trucks carrying maize for
the famine and flood stricken people of the region has warmly been
welcomed in Baidoa town.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 heavy-duty trucks carrying miscellaneous business
items have also been accompanying the food aid convoy.
</P>
<P>
It has been the first time for the business convoy to cross to
Baidoa via direct road since the town has fallen for the Rahanwein
Resistance Army (RRA) in mid last year.
</P>
<P>
The officials from Al-Islah and Towfiq companies who delivered
the food said much of the credit could be given to the
administration of the RRA which facilitated them the smooth
movement in the areas under their control.
</P>
<P>
But it has been the second time for the food aid convoy to
reach Baidoa on the same road since April 23 when more than 50
trucks from WFP and CARE-International have broken the record by
passing through the long closed road between Mogadishu and Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
The convoy which was also accompanied by more than 30 battle
wagons and over 250 heavily armed militiamen was first collected
at Jameo village, some eight kilometers south of Bur Hakaba
district controlled by the RRA forces.
</P>
<P>
The road between Mogadishu and Baidoa was once known to be the
best in southern Somalia. But it has been closed because of
political animosity between the RRA and militiamen loyal to
Hussein Mohamed Aidid battling for control of the region.
</P>
<P>
This business convoy which accompanied the aid convoy is seen
to be opening a new page for the commercial activities between
Mogadishu and Baidoa where the people at both ends needed each
other very badly. The Bay and Bakol regions mainly depend much of
their business on Mogadishu.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Hapoel Tel Aviv clinched
double league and cup champions Wednesday night after winning the
dramatic State Cup final against arch-rival Betar Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
It was the third Hapoel double in Israel's soccer history. The
last two times the team completed the historic achievement were
only in 1934 and 1938.
</P>
<P>
Hapoel was also the first team to continue to be the champion
of the State Cup since Maccabi Tel Aviv repeated winning cup
finals in 1987 and in 1988.
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday night's final, the lackluster game was only
alight in the 86th minute, when Hapoel's Croatian midfielder Dian
Rachunice struck a possible winning goal.
</P>
<P>
Desperate Betar Jerusalem throw all its men into attacks, and
leveled in the third minute of injury time through substitute
Victor Pacha, which drew the two teams into extra time.
</P>
<P>
The dramatics repeated itself again when the Tel Avivans made
it 2-1 in the 10th minute of the second half of extra time through
a goal by Salim Tuama, only for Betar's Pacha bravery hit-back
again in the last two minutes of extra time.
</P>
<P>
In the nailbiting penalty shootout, Hapoel finally won the war
of nerves with a score of 4-2.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, Hapoel Tel Aviv already won the Israeli premier
league champion with two round games to play. The win had sent
them into next season's European Championship League, and Betar
Jerusalem will substitute the Hapoel in next season's UEFA Cup.
</P>
<P>
Hapoel's Shavit Elimelech was also elected Player of the
Season 2000, with his teammate Omri Afek receiving the award for
Young Player of the Year. Their coach Dror Kashtan took the prize
for top coach.

<HEADLINE> FIFA To Streamline Competitions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The federation of
international football associations (FIFA) is studying serveral
proposals including doing away with penalty shootouts in deciding
the outcome of a game, FIFA President Joseph Blatter said.
</P>
<P>
Players might also be limited to playing a maximum of 76
matches a year from 2002, Blatter said, adding FIFA with 203
national affiliates are drawing out an international calendar for
the year 2002 onwards in order to streamline competitions and with
certain number of days considered as holidays.
</P>
<P>
FIFA are also studying the proposal to allocate 12 days for
national players to perform for their respective national teams in
a year.
</P>
<P>
A final decision on the proposals contained in the
international calendar beginning 2002 would be decided on June 6,
Blatter said after addressing the 19th Asian Football
Confederation (AFC) Congress here.
</P>
<P>
FIFA welcomes solutions to do away with penalty shootouts
after the 2002 World Cup Finals. "Personally, I don't favour
penalty shootouts ... players who miss penalty kicks in crucial
matches suffer from trauma after that. At the end, the team won
and players are the loosers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Football is a team effort and penalty shootout only cater for
individualism, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If the player performs badly when taking the penalty kick, the
whole team suffer," he said.
</P>
<P>
The golden goal rule during "sudden death" situation is
logical but something should be done about penalty shootout.
</P>
<P>
Under the present rules, 30 minutes of extra time is added on
after the 90-minute regulation time fails to produce a winner and
during extra time, the game immediately ends when a team scored.
</P>
<P>
However if the stalemate continues after extra time, the
outcome will be decided by a penalty shootout.

<P>
CHANGSHA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Hunan police, together with police
from other Chinese provinces, recently busted a drug trafficking
gang.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-nine suspected drug smugglers have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
Police said that the case involves 69 farmers from 11 towns of
Anxiang County, central China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
Initial investigations found that the gang members had smuggled
at least 40 kilograms of heroin into China concealed in their
bodies. Police confiscated more than 4,000 grams of heroin and a
sum of money for buying drugs.
</P>
<P>
Local police said that on May 28, 1999, Anxiang County police
heard that a 30-year-old farmer was being treated in a local
hospital because he had a bar-shaped object in his belly. Police
found that the object was heroin stuffed inside condoms.
</P>
<P>
Police also discovered that some 70 farmers from Anxiang County
were hired by a woman named Yang Changxiu, who gave money and
provided traveling expenses for these farmers to buy heroin in
Myanmar and smuggle the drug into Guangdong, a southern China
province.
</P>
<P>
Police said that starting from December 1998, Yang had been in
Guangdong where she provided capital, contacted with overseas drug
dealers and arranged drug smuggling routes and sold drugs.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese banks are embracing the
brave new world of E-business as international competition
intensifies in the most populous market in the world.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the on-going China Finance Industry Reforms
Summit 2000, Deputy Director of the Department of Payment Science
and Technology of the People's Bank of China (PBOC) Liu Yongchun
said that smart card has already become a focus of competition
among Chinese banks. Under the coordination of PBOC, the banks has
made fruitful efforts to develop a universal system of smart cards.
</P>
<P>
Smart card, also known as the electronic purse, is a major form
of electronic payment. Over the past decade, major commercial
banks in China have all launched smart card services. Chinese
customers now use smart cards to pay for consumer goods, medical
services, bills and draw and deposit cash from bank accounts.
Beijing, Shanghai and Changsha have begun experimenting with a
universal smart card system, enabling citizens to use one card to
obtain services from all banks and public service companies.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, China's central bank PBOC released the official
standards on the smart card. China has developed a set of
technological standards that are compatible with those of the
three biggest credit card companies in the world.
</P>
<P>
Li Juan, marketing manager of Banking (China) of Schlumberger
Smart Cards and Terminals company, said at the meeting that after
China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO),
competition from foreign smart card companies will force the
Chinese banks to shift from "conventional" business to "modern"
business.
</P>
<P>
The Guangdong branch of the Bank of China launched the country'

<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- China will allow foreign fund
management companies to set up joint ventures in the country, Vice
Chairman of China Securities Regulatory Commission Gao Xiqing said
here today.
</P>
<P>
He told the China Financial Industry Reforms International
Summit 2000 that China will open its capital market wider to
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Pending its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO),
China has already begun to gradually open its financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Gao said China will steadily push forward the process of
letting foreign fund management companies set up joint ventures in
the country, no matter whether it becomes a WTO member or not.
</P>
<P>
This is because reform of China's financial sector needs
foreign expertise on management, training and marketing, said Gao.

<HEADLINE> Reforms in China's Procuratorates To Improve Discipline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- China's top prosecutor Han Zhubin
said here today that procuratorates across the country must
strengthen the leadership of grass-roots organizations of the
Chinese Communist Party in an effort to combat widespread illegal
practices of prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
"Only in this way can procuratorial bodies meet the criteria set
by President Jiang Zemin to represent the most advanced productive
forces, the most advanced culture and the fundamental interests of
the general public," he said.
</P>
<P>
Han, procurator-general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate,
made the remarks at a national meeting attended by political heads
of local procuratorial bodies.
</P>
<P>
Jiang proposed this criteria for the whole Chinese Communist
Party during a tour of south China's Guangdong Province in
February.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the Party grass-roots procuratorate organizations have
been crippled, education and management over Party members is in
need of reform and some Party members even break the law," Han
admitted.
</P>
<P>
Party organizations of procuratorates should be improved to
assure the advancement of the whole Party, he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 73 percent of China's 220,000 prosecutors and other
staff are members of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
All staff members should be constantly educated, supervised and
abide by work rules and regulations so they do not abuse their
power, the top prosecutor said.

<HEADLINE> China to Introduce New Policy Incentives for Investment in Western Regions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to introduce a
package of new policy incentives to attract more overseas funds
into the country's central and western regions, a State
Development Planning official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiaoqiang, director of the Department of Foreign Capital
Utilization of the State Development Planning Commission (SDPC),
said at a press conference today that to facilitate the
implementation of developing China's western regions, the country
will open more areas to foreign investment, ease restrictions on
stock-holding for foreign investors, and make substantial progress
in utilizing foreign capital through new means other than
establishing overseas-funded ventures.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the retail business in all capital cities in
central and western regions will soon be opened to overseas
investment, and the telecommunications and insurance markets in
these regions will also be gradually opened to overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Other than the traditional means of establishing overseas-
funded enterprises, new means will also be adopted to facilitate
the inflow of foreign capital such as BOT, project financing,
transfer of operational rights of projects, and raising fund from
capital markets.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-funded ventures in central and western regions may
enjoy eased restrictions on the sale of their products if they are
in huge demand on the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Zhang added the central government will direct more
preferential loans from foreign governments and international
organizations to the central and western regions, increasing the
amount for these regions from 60 percent to 70 percent of total
loans.
</P>
<P>
The official revealed that China will soon announce a list
defining major industries in the central and western regions so as
to better guide overseas investment in these regions.

<HEADLINE> More Disastrous Surges Expected This Year in Chinese Water: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese oceanographers said today
that more disastrous storm tides and ocean surges are expected
this year off the Chinese coast.
</P>
<P>
Wang Fei, director of the Marine Environmental Protection
Department of the State Oceanic Administration, said three to five
devastating ocean surges are expected during June and October this
year, compared to two last year.
</P>
<P>
Wang said at a press conference that some coastal areas in
south China's Guangdong Province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region are expecting to three ocean surges while the provinces of
Fujian and Zhejiang and Shanghai City in east China are likely to
have one or two.
</P>
<P>
"During August and September, a typhoon-driven ocean surge is
expected to affect Chinese seas to the north of the Yangtze River
mouth," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-three people were killed and missing in Fujian province
on October 9, 1999 during an ocean surge which damaged 2,995 boats
and caused about 500 million U.S. dollars in direct economic
losses.
</P>
<P>
Disastrous tidal waves are expected to occur in 15 days in the
Bohai Sea, in 46 days in the Yellow Sea, in 96 days in the Taiwan
Straits and in 120 days in the South China Sea.

<HEADLINE> Plan on Jerusalem to Guide Final-Status Talks in Stockholm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 18 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli team for final-status
talks with the Palestinian side in Stockholm has taken along a
paper that outlines a detailed plan for setting up autonomous
Palestinian quarters in Jerusalem within the framework of Israeli
sovereignty over the city.
</P>
<P>
The team, headed by Israeli Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-
Ami and attorney Gilad Sher, had been engaged in "secret" talks
with Palestinian negotiators led by Palestinian Legislative Council
Speaker Ahmed Qurei for months until being disclosed last week. ,
Ha'aretz daily reported on Thursday
</P>
<P>
This channel of talks is said to have become the primary
negotiation forum. The two sides are set to resume their talks
Thursday night in Stockholm with the participation of Dennis Ross,
the U.S. Middle East special envoy.
</P>
<P>
The plan, to be brought to the talks by the Israeli team as a
guide for negotiations, has been termed as providing an "
intermediate solution" intended to get around the divisive issue of
sovereignty over the city.
</P>
<P>
However, the plan did not stipulate the intended duration of
this intermediate solution and a final date for settling the issue
of Jerusalem, said the newspaper report.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the Palestinian quarters in Jerusalem will get
broad municipal responsibilities, as well as symbolic security
powers. Two boroughs will be set up -- one Jewish and one Arab --
with a joint municipality over them to be headed by a Jewish mayor,
considering the majority of Jewish population in the city.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian quarters and borough will be linked to the
Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
Civilian affairs such as education, health and culture will be
administered by the Palestinian quarters, which, along with the
Palestinian borough, will be authorized to levy taxes and establish
their own courts for local affairs.
</P>
<P>
East Jerusalem will also have a Palestinian civil guard, with
responsibilities similar to those currently carried out by the
Jerusalem coeval guard.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, the authority for planning and building will
not be transferred to the Palestinians and the leadership in the
Palestinian quarters will be determined by the Arab population.
</P>
<P>
The Arab quarters will not include the Old City or other holy
sites, which are envisioned as holding a special status and being
administered through a joint Jewish-Muslim-Christian religious
administration.
</P>
<P>
Access to worshipers of all religions will be guaranteed at all
religious sites.
</P>
<P>
Yasser Abed Rabbo, who until a week ago headed the Palestinian
team to the official peace talks, said "Israel has no objections to
the Palestinians supervising some civil affairs in the city,
including education and culture, but not planning and building."
</P>
<P>
He was sharply critical of this kind of approach. Ha'aretz
quoted him as saying that "Israel still looks at the city from
their classic viewpoint, which means that they want to rule the
land while getting rid of having to deal with the residents."
</P>
<P>
The status of Jerusalem is one of the thorniest issues to be
tackled in the final-status talks which also include the return of
refugees, the future of Jewish settlements, water resources and
border.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have been striving for decades for a statehood
with East Jerusalem as its capital. Israel, however, insists on
keeping Jerusalem as its "undivided and permanent capital."

<P>
CAIRO, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs from
the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey's jewelry maker Goldas boosted its net profits
year-on-year in the first quarter by 241 percent to 2 million U.S.
dollars, reported Turkish Daily News on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The company's capital resources rose by 236 percent to 14.5
million dollars over the same period and total assets by 148
percent to 30 million dollars, said Sedat Yalinkaya, general
manager of the company, Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The company exports to 26 countries and plans to open
representative offices in Singapore, the United Arab Emirates,
Italy and Israel. It will expand business in Turkey through corner
shops.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey's Ramstore company will build a new 30-million-
U.S.-dollar mall in Moscow, reported the Anatolia News Agency on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A joint venture between Turkish conglomerate Koc Holding's chain
store Migros and foreign trade subsidiary Ram and contractor Enka,
Ramstore opened its first shopping center in Moscow in 1997 and
second center plus two shops in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The third, to be built in Kashirsky in the capital city's south,
is a giant shopping and entertainments center. It is expected to
open by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Ramstore plans to open similar malls in Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan
and Bulgaria this year.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Planning and Budget Commission of the Turkish
Grand National Assembly (parliament) has adopted a bill granting
autonomy to agricultural sales unions, reported Turkish Daily News
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The bill aims to completely eradicate state intervention in the
unions and make them financially independent, said Minister of
Industry and Trade Kenan Tanrikulu while presenting it to the
parliament Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill, agricultural sales unions and their
cooperatives, which purchase and process agricultural products on
behalf of the state, must evolve into joint stock companies within
a year. The unions will eventually be controlled by farmers
themselves.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Bilateral trade volume between Israel and Indonesia
could reach some 500 million U.S. dollars within three years, said
Aburizal Bakrie, president of the Chambers of Commerce of Indonesia
who heads the first trade mission to Israel.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, which have not established diplomatic ties,
have been conducting trade transactions via Singapore, which has
also served as a covert conduit for trade between Israel and
Malaysia. The lack of unfettered trading channel could hinder the
flourishing of trade between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Bank of America Corporation, the holding company of
the largest bank in the U.S., will open its first international
office, to be aimed primarily at the hi-tech industry in Tel Aviv,
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
With 565 billion U.S. dollars in assets, the bank has nearly 5,
000 branches in 22 U.S. states and some 30 countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Assets held by the Israeli public dropped by 24.22
billion shekels (about 6.05 billion U.S. dollars) to a total of 1,
084.75 billion shekels (271.19 billion dollars) in March, due
mostly to stock market losses of 28.95 billion shekels (7.24
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The total value of stocks held by the public suffered most
significantly over March, dropping from 270.44 billion shekels (67.
61 billion dollars) to 241.49 billion shekels (40.37 billion
dollars), or 22.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt, Malawi and the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) inked a trilateral agreement
Wednesday on Egyptian provision of agricultural expertise to
Malawi.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, which comes under FAO's food security
program, Egypt will offer technical assistance to Malawi in the
coming three years, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The accord is aimed at improving the living condition of poor
people in Malawi's rural areas and is jointly financed by the two
countries, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Central Bank of Egypt opened a site on the Internet
Wednesday to release annual, quarterly and monthly statistics of
the Egyptian economy.
</P>
<P>
Bank Governor Ismail Hassan said the site gives basic
information on economic growth, state budget, balance of payments,
banking statistics and important changes such as the rate of
inflation, the exchange rate and the index of share prices.
</P>
<P>
Viewers can get information on treasury bonds and government
bonds both at home and abroad, and information about the Egyptian
pound and banking legislations, the Middle East News Agency quoted
Hassan as saying.
</P>
<P>
The governor added the move is to enable the bank to pursue the
policy of transparency to give accurate information on the Egyptian
economy and financial institutions as a service for investors.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Stock Exchange Bats for Exchange by 2004 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE)
is determined to be globally competitive by becoming a full
service exchange by the year 2004, Philippine News Agency (PNA)
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted reliable documents as saying that it is
achievable because of the diverse needs of market players and
users through the implementation of a market infrastructure called
efficiency, orderliness, fairness, integrity, and transparency.
</P>
<P>
In this way, competitive liquidity that is attuned with global
standards will be put in place so that global and domestic
investors can reap the fruits of its success, the PNA said.
</P>
<P>
This confidence was proven when the market capitalization grew
by 41.06 percent last year to 1,937 billion pesos (48 U.S. dollars)
due to the introduction of new and additional shares this year.
</P>
<P>
PSE officials have expressed optimism that the market will
certainly improve much better once the Mindanao crisis is resolved.
</P>
<P>
Despite these negative developments, the composite index is not
heavily tainted. Instead, share prices continue to bottom up
rather than going sideways.
</P>
<P>
This proves that the market is slightly becoming resilient to
the onslaught of negative factors affecting the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Analysts share the view that by that time, foreign investors
will again train their eyes here with a positive outlook
considering that the shooting war has a dismal impact on the whole
economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program (WFP) has, over the last ten years, been purchasing an
average of six million U.S. dollar worth of food annually from
Tanzanian market for the growing refugees in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Tanzanian newspaper, Thursday quoted a
statement released here by the agency on Wednesday as saying that
the local procurement is both beneficial for the refugees and
growth of the local economy.
</P>
<P>
The local procurement allows the WFP to respond more quickly to
the refugees' emergency needs, said the statement, while helping
Tanzania's agricultural growth.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, some 476,000 refugees in Tanzania need
some 2, 000 tons of food on a weekly basis.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the WFP bought 1.1 million tons of food worldwide in
a value of 224 million dollars. About 54 percent of it was
procured in developing countries, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Trade Minister Urges Support for China's WTO Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Trade Minister Leif
Pagrotsky called for support for China's bid to enter the World
Trade Organization (WTO) in a signed article published on the
country's largest daily Dagens Nyheter on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Describing those who oppose China's entry as "narrow-minded and
short-sighted," Pagrotsky said it is necessary -- to both the
world and China itself -- for the Asian giant to join the bloc.
</P>
<P>
As China is already a trade power in the world, discussions on
its WTO bid concern not whether China should be isolated or
engaged but whether it should be allowed to be integrated with the
world economy in order to have it comply with the general
international practice, he said in the article.
</P>
<P>
He said that a WTO membership would impel China to open its
market to foreign enterprises, encourage its exchanges with
foreign countries and promote political stability across the east
Asian region.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in the past two decades, more than 200 million
people have been lifted out of poverty in China, the country's
living standard has been markedly raised, small enterprises have
obtained unprecedented room for development while the number of
internet users rocketed from 2 million to 10 million in the past
year.
</P>
<P>
Attributing the changes to China's implementation of the reform
and opening up policy initiated by late leader Deng Xiaoping,
Pagrotsky said China's entry into the WTO is bound to push it
further on the same track.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has become the world's seventh largest
economic entity, 10th largest trade partner and top producer of
steel, coal, cement, chemical fertilizer, textile, batteries and
TV sets. It is the fast growing developing country at present but
its per capita income stands in as low as the 81st place in the
world.
</P>
<P>
"A country that is so important and in need of development must
be closely linked to other countries," Pagrotsky concluded at the
end of his article.

results on granting China the Permanent Normal Trade Relations (
PNTR) status in the Finance Committee of the U.S. Senate and the
Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Mutual granting of PNTR status is the basis of the bilateral

accession into the World Trade Organization, as well as the
prerequisite to carrying out the agreement, Zhang said at a
regular press conference.
</P>
<P>
She reiterated that the settlement of the PNTR issue will help
China and the United States to carry out trade and economic
cooperation in a comprehensive way on the basis of equality and
mutual-benefit.
</P>

The granting of PNTR status will also create condition for the
long-term healthy and stable development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Zhang urged the far-sighted personnel in the U.S. Congress to
adopt a wise attitude to resolve the PNTR issue as soon as
possible, pointing out that "it is in the interest of both
countries."

<HEADLINE> Foreign Governments, Officials Urged to Honor Commitments on Taiwan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua)-- In light of the "inauguration" of
newly-elected Taiwan leader Chen Shui-bian on May 20 and reports
that some foreign governments have decided to send special envoys
on the occasion, Chinese foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue
today urged them to respect China's sovereignty and honor their
relevant commitments.
</P>
<P>
Zhang reiterated China's position on the issue that the
election in Taiwan is only regional in China, and that there is
but one China in the world, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of
China.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that countries concerned will respect this fact that
is recognized by most countries in the world, and do nothing that
will hurt the feelings of the Chinese people," she said.
</P>
<P>
As to reports that Japan's Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara is
to attend the "inauguration ceremony", Zhang reiterated that the
Japanese government should honor its commitments and statements on
the Taiwan issue, and stop politicians like Shintaro Ishihara from
interfering in China's internal affair, so as not to undermine the
development of bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli and Palestinian officials are to meet Thursday to
discuss the transfer of the Jerusalem-area villages of Abu Dis,
Azariya and Swahara to full Palestinian control, officials in
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The actual transfer, they added, will take place before Barak's
meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton next Thursday in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, even as the formal negotiating track continues to lie
dormant because of the resignation of Palestinian team head Yasser
Abed Rabbo, the back-channel talks are due to start up again
Thursday in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. and Egypt had curtailed efforts in recent weeks to
attain a peace agreement between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
According to American and Israeli sources, the U.S. government
chose not to respond to official Syrian positions relayed to
Washington after the summit meeting between U.S. President Bill
Clinton and his Syrian counterpart Hafez al-Assad in Geneva late
March.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egypt brought its mediation efforts on the Israeli-
Syrian track to a halt after a meeting between Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and al-Assad 10 days ago. Reports from Cairo indicate
that Mubarak was disappointed by al-Assad's intractable position in
favor of Syrian sovereignty over the northeast shore of the Galilee
Sea.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's Knesset (Parliament), in the preliminary reading on
Wednesday, passed two Likud-proposed bills that require at least 61
of 120 Knesset members to transfer parts of Jerusalem to a foreign
power or settle Palestinian refugees in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The coalition supported the measures, even though they will tie
its hands in negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials warned that the vote in favor of a bill
demanding that any changes in Jerusalem must muster the support of
at least 61 Knesset members can jeopardize an agreement on
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli cabinet Wednesday approved a two-year package of
grants and benefits worth NIS 1.6 billion (about 0.4 billion U.S.
dollars) to strengthen and develop Israeli communities along the
Lebanese border whose residents face an uncertain future with
Israel's July withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The package will affect 70 communities, classified as "
confrontation line settlements," with a total population of 170,000
and includes three towns - Nahariya, Ma'alot and Kiryat Shemona.
The 19 communities closest to the border will be granted the most
help.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the special cabinet meeting, Prime
Minister Ehud Barak said that Kiryat Shemona had been particularly
singled out for help. As a result, Kiryat Shemona will see a 50
percent reduction in local property taxes for businesses as well as
private individuals and a 25 percent reduction in income tax.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia to Export Cattle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One company, Hassan Import &AMP; Export, has already exported about
500 heads of cattle to Thailand and Malaysia. The company was
licensed last year to export up to 15,000 heads of cattle.
</P>
<P>
The cattle are raised by local farmers and then bought by the
company to be exported. Farmers can make up to 100 U.S. dollars
for each cow. Since the 1980s, Cambodia's cattle population has
grown by about two percent a year.
</P>
<P>
Chan Tong Yves, the secretary of state for the Ministry of
Agriculture,said the program will not leave the country short of
cows for plowing fields. Rather, he said, it will provide farmers
with another means of earning money and also could encourage
farmers to raise more cattle.
</P>
<P>
A holding area has been built in Poipet to check the cattle for
disease before they are shipped abroad.

LAGOS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A further group of 80 United Nations
peacekeepers have been released by Sierra Leone's rebel
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) Wednesday follows the capture of
RUF leader Foday Sankoh by the pro-government forces in the
crisis-torn country's capital Freetown,
</P>
<P>
The latest releases appeared to dampen UN concerns that
Sankoh's arrest had complicated negotiations for the freedom of
the rest of the hostages, said a source reaching here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, the RUF rebels retained ample bargaining power with
about 270 UN peacekeepers still held hostage, said the source.
</P>
<P>
A UN spokesman in Freetown confirmed that the 80 freed hostages
had arrived in the Liberian border town of Foya, where an earlier
batch of about 140 UN soldiers were released on Sunday.

KAMPALA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Over 5,000 refugees from the

</P>
<P>
The report said the refugees have registered in the camps in

The refugee influx was aggravated by renewed ADF rebel

Baguma lamented that the refugees are starving without relief
and also cannot cross back to collect food from their gardens.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Angola had called for an immediate
meeting to discuss alleged incursions by its troops into Zambia's
North- Western and Western Provinces
</P>
<P>
The Times of Zambia, a major newspaper in the country, Thursday
quoted a spokesman for Angolan embassy in Lusaka as saying on
Wednesday that Angola hopes to prevent these incidents from
damaging its good relations with the " brother government" of
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman accused the rebels of the National Union for
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), in stead of the government
troops, of launching the alleged cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
He also denied his country's aircraft had violated Zambia's
airspace.
</P>
<P>
He said the rebels were occupying Angola's Moxico Province,
bordering Zambia's North-Western Province, so it's easy for them
to make the assaults.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that his government had protested to
Zambian embassy in Luanda against the alleged straying into
Angolan territory by Zambian soldiers on April 27.
</P>
<P>
He said the more than 20 Zambian soldiers, captured in Angola's
Movave region, had been returned following talks between the two
country's military commanders.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Zambian Defence Minister Chitalu Sampa accused
Angola of attacking Zambians, including soldiers on border
patrols, in the country's North-Western and Western Provinces.

TOKYO, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed sharply lower in
Tokyo Thursday, reflecting volatility on Wall Street, with the
benchmark Nikkei index briefly slipping below 17,000 for the first
time in four trading days.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 372.40 points, or 2.14
percent, from Wednesday's close to end at 17,031.63.

The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, declined 30.31 points, or 1.85 percent, to 1,
606.14.
</P>
<P>
Fears are growing that New York share prices will remain
sluggish due to concerns about additional interest rate hikes,
making Tokyo stock prices volatile, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section decreased to 638.80 million
shares from Wednesday's 648.05 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Sumitomo Metal Mining was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
Traders attributed the sharp declines in share prices mainly to
weaknesses in high-priced information and technology issues.
</P>
<P>
Wholesalers, retailers and financial institutions also saw
large declines. In contrast, low- and medium-price issues drew
buying.
</P>

PARIS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- French Minister of Justice Elisabeth
Guigou said Thursday that she expected Portugal's judicial
authorities to meet France's demand for extradition of a French
serial killer suspect.
</P>

Guigou made the statement on Radio-Television Luxembourg one

three women in France.

"One day, we will reach agreement. We should have faith to
build a European judicial space," Guigou said, adding that
different European countries apply their own laws at present.

<P>
Rezala, a French citizen of Algerian origin, was believed to be
the killer of two women on two night trains and a third woman in
the northern French city of Amiens. All the murders took place in

<HEADLINE> "Sight First" Program Benefits Blind People in Hunan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Sight First Program for 2000 has
started in Changsha, provincial capital of central China's Hunan,
with three medical teams being sent to three counties to give one-
month treatment to cataract patients.
</P>
<P>
The teams are part of a "Sight First China Action" program
launched in 1997 by the Ministry of Health, the Chinese Disabled
Persons Federation, and Lions Club International.
</P>
<P>
The program aims to help 1.75 million Chinese people regain
their eyesight and train 11,000 ophthalmologists at rural
hospitals across the country between 1997 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, 12,000 blind people have regained
their eyesight since the program was implemented in Hunan province
in 1997. The program will help another 500 or so people suffering
from cataracts to regain their eyesight this year.
</P>
<P>
The three teams are equipped with ophthalmologic equipment,
other medical apparatus, artificial crystalloid, and financial
subsidies to cover costs for cataract operations for those who can
't afford them. Local governments in Hunan also provided the teams
with fund.
</P>
<P>
"Sight First China Action" has helped 1.1 million cataract
patients regain their eyesight across China since it was launched
three years ago. Some 60 percent are from rural areas.
</P>
<P>
By 2006, some 2.5 million cataract patients will have received
medical operations nationwide. Medical organizations designed to
help people who become blind from cataracts regain eye sight will

<HEADLINE> E-commerce Galvanizing China's Foreign Trade(2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Sun
Zhenyu has said that e-commerce is now the trend in trade, and
that it may help with the sustained growth of China's foreign
trade.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade has long been a pillar industry in China,
contributing much to the national economic growth. Last year,
total trade volume reached 360.7 billion U.S. dollars, up 11.3
percent on an annual basis, and experts predict a double-digit
growth of foreign trade this year.
</P>
<P>
China now seeks entry to the World Trade Organization, which is
believed to have a positive effect on the nation's foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
After China's WTO entry, foreign importers, especially those in
the United States and Europe, would prefer to bypass the middlemen
and buy directly from Chinese manufacturers, said Joseph Tong, CEO
of MeetChina.com, a Sino-US-sponsored e-commerce portal.
</P>
<P>
As more foreign customers are expected to adopt the Internet as
their major form of trading, Chinese manufactures should also tap
into e-commerce in order to do business with them, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, most Chinese enterprises have not realized the need to
develop on-line, and only a few of the companies have their own
websites.
</P>
<P>
Analysts consider that it is high time for small and medium-
sized enterprises in China to explore the global market by
utilizing resources on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
China's market will also allow more companies access to trade
business in the future, providing a larger opportunities for
traders, they say.

<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The emerging e-commerce and fast-
growing internet economy are providing a new growth engine for
China's foreign trade, with more and more websites turning to
services for international trade.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation(MOFTEC)
took the lead to set up its official website two years ago,
offering trade information as well as publicizing China's foreign
trade policies. The website -- www.moftec.com.cn.-- now has 700,
000 users a day , most of which from overseas.
</P>
<P>
Commercial websites aiming at foreign trade business are
mushrooming at present as they see huge opportunities in this
sector. Guangdong go163.com Corp is reported to have several
hundred thousand clients worldwide with more than 2,000 on-line
programs.
</P>
<P>
Business websites can spread huge amounts of trade information
covering vast areas and are more flexible than the traditional way
of trading, experts say.
</P>
<P>
In addition, trading companies can reduce costs and expand
business via the Internet. Clients of "go163.com" have claimed a
reduction of outlay by 20 percent and an increase of business
partners by 40 percent after doing business on-line.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Peso Continues to Weaken </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso continued to
fall against the U.S. currency early Thursday despite an increase
in domestic interest rates, a TV report said here.
</P>
<P>
The peso average 41.702 pesos against one U.S. dollar, weaker
compared to Wednesday's close at 41.665 pesos, the nation's
leading news channel ABS-CBN said.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the Philippine Central Bank's move to increase
local rates by 50 basis points did little to curtail the peso's
fall.
</P>
<P>
They said companies bought dollars as market sentiment
continues to weaken due to the bombing incident in the country's
prime business district on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An early evening bomb explosion Wednesday rocked a major
shopping mall in Makati city, Metro Manila, injuring more than 10
people.
</P>
<P>
The peso was traded at a high of 41.740 pesos and at a low of
41.665 pesos early Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Survey Says High-Tech Workers Best Paid in Washington State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 17 (Xinhua) -- A survey released Wednesday
said that software giants like Microsoft Corp. in Washington State
have the best-paid high-technology workers in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Boosted by lucrative software jobs and a bullish stock market,
high-tech workers in Washington State earned an average of 105,000
U.S. dollars in 1998, the American Electronics Association (AEA)
said after a nationwide survey of the sector.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the top five states were New Jersey at 68,700
dollars, California at 66,900 dollars, Virginia at 66,000 dollars,
and Connecticut at 65,400 dollars, said Terry Byington, a
spokeswoman for the AEA office in Redmond, Washington.
</P>
<P>
Washington State led the nation "in good part because we have a
strong concentration of software jobs here, and software jobs pay
in Washington State an average of 200,000 dollars a year," said
Byington, adding Washington State has led the nation in high-tech
income for three years in a row.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 wage doubled from six years earlier as the number of
workers in the sector climbed by 52 percent to 106,100 dollars in
Washington State. The sector also accounted for 1.8 billion
dollars, or 5 percent, of the state's 36.7 billion dollars in
exports in 1999, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The survey also included income from exercising stock options,
Byington said.
</P>
<P>
Such stock packages have brought many technology workers
tremendous wealth. For example, previous studies have estimated
that the booming stock market has turned up to one-third of
Microsoft's 33,000 employees into millionaires.
</P>
<P>
Apart from software, other high-tech businesses covered in the
survey included telecommunication services and equipment, medical
electronics, computers, semiconductors and others, Byington said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM to Quit Shintoists' League After Controversial Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori
said Thursday he will stay away from Shintoists' League for
Political Studies, a group affiliated with the Association of
Shinto Shrines, while serving as Japan's premier, after drawing
strong criticism over remarks he made at a meeting of the group
earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
"I will take time off from groups while I hold this position (
of prime minister), because I can't attend them anyway," Mori told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
It was at a meeting of the league Monday that Mori said that
Japan is a divine country with the emperor at its center.
</P>
<P>
Mori had said he saw no need to quit the group on Wednesday
night, but he changed his mind after Chief Cabinet Secretary Mikio
Aoki told him he should consider his position as prime minister
and decide what to do to "avoid misunderstandings," Japanese
government officials said.
</P>
<P>
The "divine nation" remarks were for many a disturbing echo of
Japan's nationalist fervor before and during World War II, and
drew furious responses from the opposition and disapproval from
some members of his own cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties said Mori's remarks run counter to the
principles of democracy and the separation of politics and
religion as enshrined in Japan's Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Mori apologized in the Diet (parliament) on Wednesday over the
remarks.

<HEADLINE> 169 Parliament Representatives Remain Valid in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Only 169 parliament representatives
out of 485, who were elected in the 1990 general election, remain
valid as of Thursday, disclosed a high-ranking Myanmar military
official Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The other 316 include 97 who resigned, 34 who died and 185 who
have been disqualified under election law or canceled for breach
of law, Colonel Than Tun, department head of the Office of
Strategic Studies of the Myanmar Defense Services, told a press
conference here.
</P>
<P>
Of the 169 parliament representatives who remain valid, 110 are
from the National League for Democracy (NLD), the winning party,
20 from other parties and 39 independents.
</P>
<P>
Than Tun made the disclosure at a time when the 10th
anniversary of the general election is to be marked on May 27.
</P>
<P>
The May 1990 general election, contested by 93 political
parties, was sponsored by the Myanmar military government after it
took over state power on September 18, 1988.
</P>
<P>
The NLD complains that no parliament session has been held
although nearly 10 years has passed since the election. The NLD
demanded on June 23, 1998, that the government convenes the
parliament elected in the polls, setting a deadline of 60 days,
but its demand was ignored.
</P>
<P>
Later on September 16 that year, the NLD unilaterally formed a
10-member "Committee Representing the People's Parliament (CRPP)
Elected in the 1990 General Election."
</P>
<P>
In April this year, Secretary of the CRPP U Aye Tha Aung was
arrested by the government, according to the CRPP.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Myanmar government regarded itself as a"
transitional or caretaker government," repeating frequently that
it has "no intention" to hold on to power for long.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Emphasizes Cooperation on Environment Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad and Tobago, May 17 (Xinhua) --
Environment is an issue that affects all and one's mistake in this
regard will cause harm to everyone, visiting Chinese leader Li
Ruihuan said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"So worldwide cooperation on environment protection must be
strengthened," Li, chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said during
his meeting with President of Trinidad and Tobago Raymond Robinson.
</P>
<P>
Li said the Chinese government has attached great importance to
environmental protection in recent years and a considerable number
of relevant laws have been worked out. Meanwhile, various kinds of
measures such as forestation, water and soil conservation, and
closing down factories with severe pollution have also been
adopted, Li said, adding that these measures have so far produced
a satisfactory result.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is here for a three-day official visit, acknowledged
problems exist in environmental protection in China, including
weak consciousness of environmental protection, shortage of input,
poor technology and industry. These have led to heavy pollution in
some regions.
</P>
<P>
"This situation has hindered the sustained economic and social
development as well as the improvement of people's life," said Li.
"International cooperation must be enhanced and concerted efforts
must be made in this field," Li urged.
</P>
<P>
People of all countries and regions in the world over are
living on the same and only planet, Li said. To protect the
environment means to protect ourselves. So developed countries
that have accumulated sophisticated technologies and expertise in
environmental protection should help developing countries to avoid
making any unnecessary mistakes, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li promised that China will continue strengthening cooperation
with every country around the world on environmental protection to
turn the globe into a good place to work and live in, not only for
themselves, but also for their future generations.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Li met with Foreign Minister Ralph Maraj and
Senate President Ganace Ramdial of Trinidad and Tobago. They
exchanged views on bilateral relations and issues of common
concern.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader on Equality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad and Tobago, May 17 (Xinhua) --
Visiting Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People'
s Political Consultative Conference Li Ruihuan said here Wednesday
that China takes equality as an important component of its foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
"China advocates that countries, no matter how big or small,
strong or weak, poor or rich, are all equal," Li said in a meeting
with Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago Basdeo Panday.
</P>
<P>
Li owes the smooth development of the relations between China
and Trinidad and Tobago to the fact that both countries treat each
other equally.
</P>
<P>
Equality is a major subject in the present-day world, Li
stressed. All nations, all ethnic groups, men and women,
authorities and civilians and all people should be equal, he said.
Equality is a target sought by mankind, a tendency of historical
development and a symbol of social progress, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ancient Chinese thinkers proposed that all were equal. Sun
Yat-sen, a forerunner in the Chinese revolution in modern times,
proposed: "To unite with all nations that treat the Chinese
equally."
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC National Committee Chairman pointed out that there
still exist phenomena in the present-day world that the big bully
the small, the strong bully the weak and the rich oppress the poor.
</P>
<P>
"China is willing to join hands with people of all countries
to make an unremitting effort to build up a new world order of
equality that is just and reasonable," Li concluded.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Imposes Arms Embargo Against Eritrea, Ethiopia  (Updated with more information) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council on
Wednesday night adopted a resolution to impose an arms embargo on
Eritrea and Ethiopia, two nations currently locked in a new round
of fighting in the two-year-long border war.
</P>
<P>
The embargo will remain in effect for 12 months before the 15-
nation Council decides what action to take on the arms ban.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council "decided that all states shall prevent the
sale or supply to Eritrea and Ethiopia, by their nationals, from
their territories, or using their flag vessels or aircraft," the
resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The Council also "decides that all States shall prevent any
provision to Eritrea and Ethiopia by their nationals or from their
territories of technical assistance or training related to the
provision, manufacture, maintenance or use" of all types of arms.
</P>
<P>
However, the arms embargo "shall not apply to supplies of non-
lethal military equipment intended solely for humanitarian use,"
the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council calls on all states to act strictly in
conformity with the resolution, and it will seek from all states
further information regarding the action taken by them with a view
to implementing effectively the arms ban, the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council "condemned the fighting between Eritrea
and Ethiopia, and demanded that both parties immediately cease all
military action and refrain from the further use of force," it
said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also demands "the earliest" resumption of
"substantive peace talks," under the auspices of the Organization
of African Unity (OAU), on the basis of the Framework Agreement,
accepted by both warring countries, said the resolution.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was adopted after days of hard work by the
Security Council members to narrow the gap on the draft resolution.
</P>
<P>
The latest clash between the two Horn of African countries
began last Friday following the collapse of peace talks held by
the OAU in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between the two neighboring countries over border
claims exploded into war in May 1998 and tens of thousands have
been killed in the fighting.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Small Business-Online Purchases Jump  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Small businesses in the United
States spent 25 billion U.S. dollars for goods and services over
the Internet last year, more than 12 times the previous year,
according to a study released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
For the first time business-to-business spending topped online
consumer spending by a whopping five billion dollars. Meanwhile,
the number of small businesses transacting business online jumped
55 percent to 2.8 million from 1.8 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted by Access Markets International (AMI)
Partners Inc., a New York-based consulting firm specializing in
Internet, IT and Telecom market trends, with a focus on small and
medium business enterprises. Small businesses are those with one
to 100 employees.
</P>
<P>
AMI projects that U.S. small business online purchases will
register 118 billion dollars by 2001, emerging as a critical
driver of overall B2B e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
About 670,000 small businesses have ventured into the online
auction arena bidding for products and services, and nearly one
million small businesses plan to participate in online auctions in
2000, it said.
</P>
<P>
The study also found that 1.3 million small businesses are
interested in using the Internet to collaborate or pool with other
small businesses to buy in groups to obtain better prices for
products and services.
</P>
<P>
While small businesses may be turning to the Internet to buy,
however, they are not using it to sell, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
"There is evidence of e-backlash among small businesses," AMI
said. "Six out of 10 small businesses don't believe that the Web
is well suited for selling their wares, and they feel overwhelmed
by the technological challenges involved in establishing a solid
online presence."
</P>
<P>
Specifically, they are concerned by high costs, inadequate
technical support and security issues involved with conducting
business online and out-sourcing critical functions.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 600,000 U.S. small businesses were selling their
products and services via e-commerce sites in 1999, up from 400,
000 small business in 1998. The value of such transactions rose
from 14 billion dollars in 1998 to 25 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Among the 7.4 million U.S. small businesses, 4.2 million access
the Net, according to the study. Almost 17 million, or one-quarter
of small business employees, use the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Since 80 percent of small businesses have fewer than 10
employees and they are relatively split between metropolitan and
outlying areas, e-commerce offers tremendous efficiencies and
economics of scale, AMI said.

<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua)-- Chinese Minister of Defense Chi
Haotian met here today with Joseph Nye, former assistant secretary
of defense of the United States, praising him for his role in
promoting the relations between the two countries and their armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
Chi, who is also a state councilor and vice-chairman of the
Chinese Central Military Commission, noted that China is the world
's largest developing country and the U.S. is the biggest
developed country, adding that developing friendly cooperative
ties between the two countries not only conforms to the
fundamental interests of the two peoples, but also is conducive to
the peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and the world
at large.
</P>
<P>
Chi told his American guest that China's policy on the Taiwan
issue remains that of "peaceful reunification" and "one country,
two systems."

"However, we do not promise to abandon the use of force" to
achieve reunification of the motherland, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
There is only one China in the world, Chi said, adding that any
attempts to engage in Taiwan independence and separation can never
be allowed.
</P>
<P>
Everything can be talked under the "one China" principle, Chi
noted.
</P>
<P>
He urged the U.S. government to abide by the three Sino-U.S.
joint communiques and stop selling weapons to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Nye, who is also dean of the Kennedy School of
Government of Harvard University, said that he is pleased to see
the good cooperative relations built between his School and the
Chinese People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said he believes the bilateral relations between
the two countries will be improved, although U.S.-China relations
met with some difficulties last year.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Nye said he hopes that the two countries will work to
resolve the existing problems in bilateral relations on the basis
of consultations on equal footing.

<HEADLINE> Austria Agrees to Compensate World War II Forced Laborers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Austria reached an agreement with
the United States, Belarus, Czech, Hungary, Poland, Russia and
Ukraine Wednesday morning on compensating World War II forced
laborers in Austria.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued at a press conference here after a meeting
of the Reconciliation Conference said, "We applaud the willingness
of the Austrian government, industry and businesses to grant
payments to the victims to contribute to peaceful cooperation in a
changing Europe.
</P>
<P>
"We acknowledge the effort by Austria and affirm the basic
principles of the draft Austrian Reconciliation Fund legislation,"
continued the statement. "We also agree to expedite efforts to
reach agreement on the draft law involving all parties."
</P>
<P>
The delegations to the conference also discussed bilateral
agreements proposed by Austria with Central and East European
governments. They agreed in principle on their content and
discussed the need for legal peace for Austrian companies.
</P>
<P>
Sutart Eizenstat, deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of
Treasury, the U.S. representative at the conference, said the U.S.
is prepared to facilitate discussions between the plaintiffs'
attorneys and Austrian company attorneys to develop a mechanism to
achieve legal peace. He said the next legal Working Group Meeting
would be in Washington on May 30.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, payments to slave and forced
laborers will fall into five categories. Prisoners who were
forced to work at concentration camps will receive 105,000
Austrian shillings (7,000 U.S. dollars those working in the
manufacturing sectors will be paid 35,000 shillings, and those
forced to do farm work will be compensated with 20,000 shillings.
Women laborers who gave birth will be given an additional payment
of 5,000 shillings and children under the age of 12 will receive
the same amount as their parents.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 150,000 people forced to work during
World War II in Austria are still alive and some 24,500 of them
are residing in the territory outside the above-said six countries.
The Austrian government will pay a total of 6 billion shillings (
400 million U.S. dollars) to them.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Representative Eizenstat said that Austria should tackle
the problem caused by Aryanization advocated by the Nazis during
World War II as soon as possible. "The next step Austria needs to
take is to tackle holocaust crimes and compensate the victims.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian representative attending the conference expressed
her hope that the Austrian Parliament would complete the Austrian
Reconciliation Fund legislation in the coming summer and sign all
agreements to compensate the forced laborers by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Schuessel, chancellor of Austria, who planned to
attend but not appear at the press conference, is reportedly
satisfied with the results of the conference. "To win a future,
one must acknowledge the past, and we must face the dark chapter
in our history," Prime Minister Schuessel said.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Considers Arms Embargo Against Ethiopia, Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
began a late night meeting Wednesday to continue the discussion on
whether to impose an arms embargo against Ethiopia and Eritrea as
the two neighbors are continuing the latest round of fighting in
the two-year-long border war.
</P>
<P>
The closed-door meeting, which followed a late afternoon
session Wednesday, began at 10:50 p.m. EST after days of hard work
by experts from Council members to narrow their gap over the draft
resolution, which, if adopted, would ban arms sales to the two
countries, more than nine million of whose people are on the brink
of starvation because of a regional drought.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Council, prompted by the renewed border fighting
in the Horn of Africa, adopted a resolution late Friday last week,
demanding Ethiopia and Eritrea immediately stop their conflict and
threatened unspecified action if fighting continued on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The latest clash between the two nations broke out Friday last
week following the collapse of peace talks held by the
Organization of African Unity in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between the two neighboring countries over border
claims and economic policy exploded into war in May 1998 and tens
of thousands have been killed in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea both insist they want a peaceful
settlement but each blames the other for a series of failed peace
initiatives since the outbreak of the war two years ago.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Rejects Microsoft Remedy Proposal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government rejected
Wednesday Microsoft Corp.'s proposal to change its business
practices, saying it would fail to stop the firm's violations of
antitrust law, and insisted on its own proposal to break up the
company.
</P>
<P>
In a 70-page brief filed in U.S. District Court, the government
said the Microsoft's remedy proposal would not "undo the damage to
competition caused by its past illegal conduct."
</P>
<P>
"Microsoft's proposed remedy is neither serious nor sensible,"
the government said.
</P>
<P>
The court filing came in response to an offer by Microsoft last
week to restrict its business conduct rather than be broken up by
the court, which it said would be an extreme measure.
</P>
<P>
A Microsoft spokesman said the government's views were an
unfortunate attempt to defend an extreme proposal that would
damage consumers.
</P>
<P>
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled April 3 that the
software giant had broken U.S. antitrust law by abusing its
monopoly in operating systems for personal computers.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Justice Department and 17 states called on April 28
for Microsoft to be split into a personal computer operating
systems business and a separate applications software firm that
would retain such assets as the Microsoft Office software suite
and the Internet Explorer browser.
</P>
<P>
No matter what remedy the judge decides on, Microsoft says it
has always acted within the law and plans to appeal Jackson's
findings.
</P>
<P>
The government filed the landmark case in May 1998, charging
Microsoft with illegally using its monopoly power to destroy
Netscape, a Web browser with operating system aspirations. The
trial will begin four months later in October.

TAIYUAN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- China will spend six million yuan (
722,891 U.S. dollars) to repair and preserve four huge iron oxen
made during the Tang Dynasty (A.D. 618-907).
</P>
<P>
The oxen, located at the historical site of Pujin Ferry along
the section of the Yellow River in Shanxi Province, north China,
were originally built on iron plates and used as on-ground anchors.
They weigh from 26 to 45 tons apiece.
</P>
<P>
They were buried in mud and sand in 1911 and unearthed in April
1989.
</P>
<P>
Experts call them state treasures for their fine craftsmanship
in iron founding and sculpture.
</P>
<P>
The figures currently face the threat of oxidation and
corrosion as they are situated in a low, damp place.
</P>

According to a protection plan, they will be raised 12.2 meters
to their original position, and a waterproof foundation will be
built beneath each one.

YANGON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar exported a total of 11,000
tons of rice in the first two months of this year, a drop of 3.5
percent over the same period of 1999, according to the latest
figures of the country's Central Statistical Organization.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 20 people were killed and
75 injured in a bomb explosion in eastern Sri Lanka Wednesday when
large numbers of people were attending celebrations near a
Buddhist temple, said reports reaching here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The bomb went off Wednesday evening inside a high security zone
in the eastern town of Batticaloa during celebrations to mark the
holiest day of the Buddhist calendar, known as Wesak, said the
reports.
</P>
<P>
International aid officials, who rushed to the main hospital in
Batticaloa, some 300 kilometers east of Colombo, said 15 people
had died on the spot, including a police constable and two
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
It is not known who carried out the bombing but similar attacks
in the area have been blamed on the separatist Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels who are expert in using bombs and
land mines.
</P>
<P>
Local residents were quoted as saying the bomb had been placed
in an ice-cream box on a bicycle.
</P>
<P>
The celebrations were attended by large numbers of people from
the armed forces and police as well as local civilians.
</P>
<P>
The latest bombing came as President Chandrika Kumaratunga, in
a message on Wesak Wednesday, called for national unity and an end
to the bitter civil war.
</P>
<P>
"We will soon take steps to provide comprehensive and lasting
solutions drawing from the philosophy of Buddhism based on
equality with honor and coexistence which everybody can accept,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Government officials here said they suspected the LTTE may have
carried out the attack in order to shift the attention of the
security forces from the northern peninsula of Jaffna where heavy
fighting has been raging.
</P>
<P>
Some 40,000 government soldiers and police are deployed in the
Jaffna peninsula to combat LTTE rebels, who have been fighting for
a separate homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and
east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The rebels are engaged in a ferocious offense in a bid to
retake Jaffna town which had been under their control for five
years as a de facto separate state till December 1995 when they
were driven out.

<HEADLINE> Kyrgyzstan Determined to Contain Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Kyrgyz government is set to
lower the country's soaring inflation in the next 10 years, news
reaching here from Bishkek quoted Kyrgyz Minister of Finance
Sultan Mederov as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an international seminar on Kyrgyzstan's 10-year
plan of comprehensive development, the minister said the
government has set the effort of putting inflation under control
as its major task.
</P>
<P>
Mederov said the government vowed to cut the growth rate of the
consumer price from 1999's 39.9 percent, a record high in five
years, to less than 15 percent in 2001 and 3-5 percent in 2010, by
taking steps of tightening the control of currency circulation and
fluctuating exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
In order to curb external impact upon domestic prices, the
Kyrgyz government also planned to boost domestic production and
cut import by making effective use of the country's resources, he
said, adding Kyrgyzstan is actively seeking ways to expand export.
</P>
<P>
Mederov told the seminar that the 10-year development strategy
is designed to improve the people's living standard and eliminate
poverty on the basis of achieving sustainable economic growth. The
country will be geared up to the development of transport,
telecommunications, energy and social infrastructure construction,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister also announced that Kyrgyzstan's gross domestic
product (GDP) in 2000 is expected to rise by 5.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> 11 Million First-Time Online Consumers Expected in U.S. This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"As the Internet continues to mature, so will consumers'
shopping habits, causing online retail sales to spiral upward and
onward," the report released by Forrester Research, a leading U.S.
Internet research firm, said.
</P>
<P>
The report, based on field studies and more than 100,000
consumer surveys, noted that the Web buyers' profiles as well as
the product categories they buy from are vastly different from
those even one year ago.
</P>
<P>
When Forrester started surveying online consumers three years
ago, Web buyers were a homogeneous group consisting of affluent
males who used the Net to purchase software, it said.
</P>
<P>
"As new Web shoppers -- who increasingly resemble the offline
population -- become more comfortable shopping online, their Net
spending habits will mirror those currently seen with experienced
Web shoppers," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Forrester attributes online retail growth to an influx of
female customers as well as increased confidence and spending in
researched categories, such as travel, computer hardware and
consumer electronics.
</P>
<P>
Security concerns remain the key factor for online consumers
who do not purchase on the Net, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 percent of wired households said they do not shop
online because of fear of releasing credit card information.
Ninety-four percent of online shoppers are also concerned with
unreasonable shipping prices, according to the report.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists will study the
genetic map of 800 plants that have been used as medicine here for
thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive project will enable scientists to separate
chromosomes and nucleic acid, locate all the functional genes, and
set up a gene data base.
</P>
<P>
If successful, widespread production of traditional Chinese
medicine will become possible, and medicinal plants will be mass
planted using trans-gene method.
</P>
<P>
For thousands of years, Chinese have used mixtures of plants
and animal bones to cure disease with a success rate that
continues to baffle modern science.
</P>
<P>
While western chemical-based medicine is used in Asia, many
people prefer traditional Chinese medicine which they believe has
fewer side effects.
</P>
<P>
As collecting medicinal plants in the wild is not easy, Japan
and the Republic of Korea have developed traditional medicine in
laboratories and made them marketable.
</P>
<P>
"Our program will give a full picture of the genome of
traditional medicine and develop new varieties of drugs," said Guo

<HEADLINE> Land Law Poorly Enforced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Lax enforcement of land laws by
local governments at all levels is to blame for most of last year'
s violations of land regulations, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to a Ministry of Land and Resources report released
Wednesday, some local governments ignored land laws as they pushed
economic development projects. And most of the violations occurred
in relatively developed areas.
</P>
<P>
Local governments themselves accounted for only 15.3 percent of
the violations. But their inadequate enforcement of land laws
allowed local businesses to engage in illegal land use.
</P>
<P>
The report says, there were 168,309 land-related violation
cases last year, involving 28,732 hectares of land. And 10,983 of
them are cultivated.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, 86.2 percent of the cases had been
solved, and 630 of the 773 persons held responsible were punished.
</P>
<P>
When violations occur, the usual practice in many places is to
fine the law-breakers and have them go through the land-use
application process. This actually aids offenders and encourages
others to ignore land laws because the regulations are rarely
enforced, the report declares.
</P>
<P>
A more effective way of preventing violations would be to have
land managed more closely and independently. The report points out
that grassroots land administrations are subordinate to local
governments at the same level under the present management system
and often influenced by them.

BRASILIA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Seventy-two percent of all
cardboard manufactured in Brazil is being recycled, the Brazilian
Cardboard Association said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Association President Paulo Sergio Peres said the recycling
figure, one of the highest in the world, is predicted to continue
rising this year, when the production of cardboard boxes reaches 1.
7 million tons this year, a 6 percent increase over last year.
</P>
<P>
He said that because of a good fruit harvest in his country
last year, the production of cardboard boxes was 58.4 percent more
than in 1998 when 67,000 tons of cardboard boxes were used by
various fruit producers and departments.

<HEADLINE> Chernobyl Closure to be Decided in May: Kuchma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma said
Wednesday that a final agenda for the closure of the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant will be set this month, according to reports
from the Interfax-Ukraine News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma made the remark at a press conference here following his
meeting with the visiting Austrian President Thomas Klestil who
arrived here earlier Wednesday morning for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
A special committee, led by Prime Minister Viktor Yushchenko,
will study the effects that the closure will have on the country's
economy, society and politics, said Kuchma.
</P>
<P>
Austria has granted Ukraine one billion shillings (about 80
million U.S. dollars) to finance the closure plan, Kuchma added.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine promised to close the plant in 2000. After the world's
worst nuclear accident in 1986, only one of Chernobyl's four
reactors remains in operation.
</P>
<P>
Like most other nuclear plants in the former Soviet Union,
Chernobyl sees frequent malfunctions that force reductions or
stoppages of output. Most accidents do not release radiation and
are quickly repaired.
</P>
<P>
On other issues he discussed with his Austrian counterpart,
Kuchma told reporters that by this summer, Austria will deliver
compensation for the 43,000 plus Ukrainians forced into slave-
labor by the Nazi-era Austrian government.
</P>
<P>
They also talked about the integration of Europe, work on
reopening the Danube River for navigation, and on Ukraine's entry
into the World Trade Organization, Kuchma added.
</P>
<P>
Following their meeting, the two presidents signed a series of
documents on bilateral cooperation in fields such as custom
services, road transport and cultural exchange.
</P>
<P>
Klestil was the first Austrian head of state to visit Ukraine
since the former Soviet Union republic became independent in 1991.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Broadband Consumers to Hit 35 Million by 2005 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The installed base of broadband-
enabled consumers in the United States will reach 35 million by
2005, as availability soars and prices for basic access fall,
according to a report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report by Forward Concepts, a U.S. consulting firm
concerned with electronics market research, said that cable modems,
used to connect a computer to a cable TV service that provides
Internet access, should garner nearly 60 percent of the consumer
subscriber market, while DSL (digital subscriber line) will
dominate the small office-home office and enterprise segments.
</P>
<P>
Despite technical, regulatory and customer uncertainties, the
report concluded, the cable modem and DSL communities will
continue to roll out services and that customers of all types are
increasingly aware of the availability of broadband local access
and are willing to pay more for these always-on services.
</P>
<P>
Forward Concepts also found that broadband penetration into the
7 million U.S. companies with fewer than 20 employees could reach
40 to 50 percent, and into the one million companies with 20 to
100 employees could reach 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
Internet access will remain an overriding concern, according to
the report, but vendors and service providers must view DSL and
cable modems as enabling technology for enhanced services. These
services include packet voice, e-commerce, distributed education
and training, entertainment, gaming and video-conferencing.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, the two largest consumer applications
for broadband services are Internet access and education/training,
which are forecast to grow to 6.2 billion U.S. dollars and 2.1
billion dollars respectively in 2005. The major office-home
office applications will be Internet access and packet voice, with
expected market size of 4.6 billion dollars and 1.3 billion
dollars respectively in 2005.
</P>
<P>
In the enterprise market, the two largest applications are
forecast to be virtual private networks (VPNs) and general
Internet access at 5.1 billion dollars and 1.7 billion dollars
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze River Estuary Deepened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 18 (Xinhua) -- An 8.5-meter-deep channel has been
completed at the mouth of the Yangtze River, China's longest river,
and is scheduled to open officially in June.
</P>
<P>
The channel is 51.77 km long and 300 m wide at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
It is the first phase of a massive project launched in January
1998 to improve shipping conditions of the Yangtze estuary by
clearing and deepening the waterway to turn the metropolis into an
international shipping center in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
The project, co-funded by China's Ministry of Communications,
Shanghai municipality and the neighboring Jiangsu Province, is
expected to take 10 years to complete.
</P>
<P>
The ultimate goal of the three-phase project is to lower the
depth at the estuary to 12.5 meters to allow more than 100,000-
tonnage ships to enter Shanghai harbor. A 12.5-meter-deep channel
is considered a prerequisite for ships carrying 3,000 to 4,000
TEUs.
</P>
<P>
The current channel at the Yangtze estuary is less than six
meters deep and is unable to accommodate 50,000-tonnage container
ships. It only allows 10,000-tonnage ships fully loaded at the
moment.

SHENZHEN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen, one of China's earliest
special economic zones, will build six more container berths in
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the city's development planning
bureau, Shenzhen plans to build four 50,000-dwt (dead weight
tonnage) container berths at the city's Yantian Harbor with an

<P>
The city will also invest 1.7 billion yuan to build two new
container berths at Santudi of Shekou Harbor. On completion, the
two berths will be capable of handling 500,000 TEU (twenty-foot
equivalent unit) of containers annually.
</P>
<P>
The construction of berths at the two places have been
submitted to the State Development Planning Commission for
approval, said the official.
</P>

GUANGZHOU, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A great number of ruins and
cultural relics from ancient dynasties before Qin (B.C. 221-B.C.
207) have been found in the construction site of the second-ring
expressway in Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong
Province.
</P>
<P>
Local archaeological workers unearthed pottery kilns, tombs,
hard potsherd and pottery bearing geometric prints from Spring and
Autumn Period (B.C. 770-B.C.476 ) to Warring States (B.C. 475-B.C.
221) in three places.
</P>
<P>
The discovery is said to be first of its kind in Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Ancient kilns belonging to dynasties after Qin, village ruins
of Song Dynasty (960-1279), a group of house foundations from Ming
Dynasty (1368-1644), tombs from Ming and Qing (1644-1911)
dynasties have also been unearthed in the excavation.
</P>
<P>

bun, which is believed to be from early Western Han (B.C. 206-24 A.
D.), to a local museum for exhibition.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Book on Taiwan Issue Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese researcher said
that the interference by the U.S. government over the past decades
has been the main reason for the pending Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Tang Zhengrui, a research worker with the Taiwan Affairs Office
of China's State Council, made the remark in his book titled "
China and the U.S. Playing Chess on the Taiwan Issue" published
recently by the Shanghai People's Publishing House.
</P>
<P>
In the book Tang explained that the U.S. government has been
attempting to make Taiwan an unsinkable "aircraft carrier" on the
western Pacific Ocean and use Taiwan as a "chess piece " to meddle
in China's internal affairs and to prevent China from developing
and becoming strong.
</P>
<P>
Tang's book focuses on the struggle between the Chinese and U.S.
governments on the Taiwan issue from 1966 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
It elaborates the Chinese government's "One China" stance that
China is an inalienable part of China, and the government of the
People's Republic of China is the sole legal government
representing China.
</P>
<P>
The book also records changes in Taiwan policies since Nixon's
presidency.

<HEADLINE> Barak May Postpone Talks With Clinton: Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
has asked Washington to postpone his talks with U.S. President Bill
Clinton, Israel Radio reported Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Barak had been scheduled to leave Israel on Saturday for
Washington to hold talks there with Clinton on ways to move the
Middle East peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
He had planned to travel to New York for talks with the United
Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the issue of U.N.
peacekeeping in south Lebanon after Israel's withdrawal in July
this year.
</P>
<P>
Due to the new tense situation in south Lebanon in recent days,
Barak has asked Washington for the postponement of the talks, the
radio said.
</P>
<P>
Barak's office is contacting with Washington right now to seek
the postponement and if possible, Barak also wants to cancel the
trip to Washington in the near future, the radio added.
</P>
<P>
Fighting has flared in recent days in south Lebanon as the
deadline for ending Israel's 22-year occupation there draws near.
Barak has vowed to bring Israeli troops home by July.
</P>
<P>
A Hezbollah guerrilla was killed in heavy fighting Thursday, as
two Israeli soldiers, two members of the Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army, four Lebanese civilians and a U.N. peacekeeper were
wounded.
</P>
<P>
The two Israeli soldiers were hit in Hezbollah mortar bomb
attacks on their position in Rihane on the outer edge of the
security zone, Israel announced. One of them was in serious
condition.
</P>
<P>
The exchanges of artillery fire and Israeli air raids on
suspected guerrilla targets continued through midday Thursday. It
was the heaviest fighting since cross-border attacks early this
month following Israel's air raids on Lebanese civilian targets,
said Israeli military.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon said
a Fijian peacekeeper was wounded when mortars fired from the
Israeli-occupied security zone hit his position.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the so-called security zone in south lebanon in
1985 with a self-claimed purpose of protecting its northern
security. Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to end
Israeli occupation since then.

factors and lots of advice and lots of views of other people,
including the President of Russia," the official added.
</P>
<P>
The official, who briefed reporters on the upcoming summit
between Clinton and Russian President Vladimir Putin, said the
summit is going to have a very broad agenda including economic
issues, regional security, nonproliferation and arms control.
</P>
<P>
Top on the agenda will be the dispute on possible changes which
Washington seeks to the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty signed
in 1972 to clear the way for the United States to deploy the NMD
project.
</P>
<P>
Russia, strongly opposing the deployment of an NMD system by
the U.S., rejects any changes to the ABM treaty, arguing that such
a move will undermine the world architecture of arms control and
the basis of international security.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official indicated that the decision to deploy an NMD
system was "not a fait accompli." "The president is going to make
a decision based on one criterion -- what is in the long-term
national interests of the United States."
</P>
<P>
On a separate arms control issue, the official noted that the
United States will stick to the agreement reached between
Washington and Moscow in 1997 that the two countries will
negotiate a cut to a range of 2,000 to 2,500 nuclear warheads in
the START III talks.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Russian proposal that each side reduces their
nuclear arsenal to 1,500, the official said: "That's been out
there for some time. What we have said to the Russians is we think
2,000-2,500 is appropriate, it's the right number."

<HEADLINE> Cuba Watches Bill Presented to U.S. Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Cuba said Thursday that it is
observing with attention a draft law presented to the U.S.
Congress for the partial lifting of the trade embargo imposed on
the island four decades ago.
</P>
<P>
Cuban Foreign Ministry spokesman Alejandro Gonzalez said that
the draft law to permit the sale of food and medicines to the
island is a correct decision expressing the sentiment of the
majority of the U.S. public opinion.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that no false expectations must be harbored
about the future of that proposal.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez said that there are in the U.S. Congress some
influential persons and legislators of the Miami terrorist mafia
who can thwart that intention as it has happened on other
occasions.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Cuba has a positive appreciation of the
way the U.S. public opinion is expressing itself about the
blockade to Cuba and asked the Clinton administration and the
legislators to take into account what the U.S. people think.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez said that what proceeds now is the total lifting of
the blockade against his country and the rectification of a policy
of hostility and aggression of more than 40 years.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress is studying a measure that will benefit Cuba
and North Korea, which would permit the sale of food and medicines
to those nations, with which Washington does not maintain formal
relations.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Africa-Caribbean Trade Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
signed a bill on Thursday that will allow 73 countries in Sub-
Sahara Africa, Central America and the Caribbean to have more
access to the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
Under the legislation approved by Congress earlier this month,
clothing made from U.S. yarn and fabric could enter the country
without duty or quotas. Clothing made in Africa from African
fabric would be allowed to rise from 1.5 percent of U.S. imports
to 3.5 percent over eight years.
</P>
<P>
African exports of those products to the United States will be
boosted from about 250 million U.S. dollars now to an estimated 4.
2 billion, according to the legislation.
</P>
<P>
African nations where the gross domestic product is less than 1,
500 U.S. dollars a year per capita would be eligible for quota-
free benefits for four years in cases where they use third-country
fabric.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Clinton said that Sub-Saharan
Africa with a population of 700 million remains one of "the
biggest potential trade partners" for the America.
</P>
<P>
"I say "potential" because American exports now account for
only 6 percent of the African market. This bill will surely change
that, as it expands Africa's access to our markets and improves
the ability of African nations to ease poverty, increase growth,
and heal the problems of their people." Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Central America and the Caribbean, Clinton
said the U.S. exports to the region exceeded $19 billion, making
it the sixth-largest market for the United States.
</P>
<P>
"What we see in the Caribbean Basin and in Africa is that trade
can broaden the benefits of the global economy and lift the lives
of people everywhere," he added.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Cells Vehicles to Gain Market Share in 10 Years, Says Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Internal combustion engine
hegemony in the automotive industry may not come to its final
stage soon, but it will lose its power to emerging fuel cell
technologies, according to a new study released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Automotive fuel cells will have nearly a 4 percent market share
in the United States, with 608,000 vehicles by 2010. Market
penetration can rise as high as 1,215,000 fuel cell vehicles,
which will represent 7.6 percent of the total U.S. automotive
market, according to the study conducted by Allied Business
Intelligence Inc. (ABI), a U.S. technology research think tank.
</P>
<P>
ABI looks at current fuel cell technologies and examines the
potentially vast applications in transportation, from passenger
cars, buses, trucks, industrial trucks (fork lifts) to golf carts.
The study gives particular attention to proton exchange membrane,
solid oxide fuel cell and alkaline fuel cell technologies as the
leading candidates for early implementation.
</P>
<P>
Proton exchange membrane fuel cells will dominate the fuel cell
market in the United States, with 80 percent of all automotive
fuel cells by 2010, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
One of the major issues with automotive fuel cells is not the
status of the technology, ABI said, but rather bringing down the
costs with real manufacturing capacity starting at 100,000 units.
Currently, none of the fuel cell developers have the production
capacity for what is now being designed and built. Mass production
will be reached by the end of the decade, when fuel cells will
become full price-competitive with internal combustion engines.
</P>
<P>
Following market penetration in the United States, ABI said,
automotive fuel cells will gain market share in Japan and the
European Union, particularly in Germany. Japan may see as high as
4.5 percent fuel cell market penetration by 2010, compared to 3.7
percent in Europe.

<HEADLINE> More U.N. Detainees Freed by Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RUF leader Foday Sankoh, who was captured Tuesday, continues to
be in the custody of the Government of Sierra Leone at an
undisclosed location, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no plan by the United Nations to try Sankoh at this
stage," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our priorities are to get the detainees released, consolidate
our positions in the country and, if possible, get the political
process restarted," he added.
</P>
<P>
The UNAMSIL was sent into the West African nation to monitor a
peace accord signed last July by the Sierra Leonean Government and
Sankoh, which was intended to end the nation's nine-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
There are a total of 9,675 military personnel stationed in
Sierra Leone. More than 500 UNAMSIL personnel have been taken
hostage since the beginning of May.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council is considering a proposal to increase the
UNAMSIL's strength to 13,000 in anticipation of the arrival of
reinforcements that would push the force strength beyond the
mandated 11,100 by early next week, Eckhard said. However, no
agreement is reached on this issue.

MEXICO CITY, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Strong rains that occurred in
the whole Honduran territory have stranded some 30,000 people in
the Olancho department in the northeast of the country, official
sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Rains caused the Rio Guayape to outflow its banks, destroying
the Las Jaguas, La Empalizada, Guayabillas, and the Las Joyas in
the Olancho department, stranding some 25 peasant communities,
according to reports reaching here from Tegucigalpa.
</P>
<P>
These communities mainly produce milk, cheese, and basic grains.
</P>
<P>
Floods were reported in some neighborhoods of the El Progreso
City in a banana producing zone in the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
The strong rains are caused by a tropical wave that moves along
the Atlantic littoral with a speed of 16 to 24 kph, according to
the Contingency Permanent Commission.

BUENOS AIRES, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Fernando
de la Rua and his Chilean counterpart, Ricardo Lagos, Thursday
held their first working meeting in Buenos Aires to analyze the
strengthening of the bilateral relations and the perspectives of a
common future.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that the two presidents exchanged
decorations Thursday morning and then started private
conversations in De la Rua's office in the House of Government.
</P>
<P>
Both presidents analyzed during the meeting some of the main
points to be included in the joint statement they will sign Friday.
</P>
<P>
The importance of stressing the concept of strategic alliance
between the two countries, aimed at promoting a common action in
the commercial field against international protectionism, stands
out among other points.
</P>
<P>
The presidents will meet after the private conversation with
the members of the official delegation that accompanies Lagos in
the visit and with Argentine government ministers.
</P>
<P>
De la Rua invited Lagos, out of protocol, to tour some of the
House of Government halls and both went out into one of the

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Fernando
de la Rua Thursday bade farewell at the Government House to the
delegation that will go to China to promote bilateral commerce.
</P>
<P>
The president underscored in his farewell speech the big
meaning of the trip of the delegation that will leave Friday for
China, saying that it will contribute to tightening even more the
ties not only between the two countries, but also those of the
Southern Common Market with China.
</P>
<P>
The president pointed at the importance of the enormous Chinese
market for the Argentine exports, saying that he expects that the
trade exchanges between the two countries will increase
considerably after the barriers are lifted.
</P>
<P>
He wished that the Chinese businessmen will not only export
their products to Argentina but also invest in Argentina to
increase the Argentine exports and that the visit will be
successful and fruitful.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said that it is not frequent for a president of
the Republic to send off in this way a commercial mission, which
proves the special attention given to the commercial relations
with China.
</P>
<P>
The delegation that will visit China on May 21-27 will be led
by Foreign Vice Minister Horacio Chiquizola, and is made up of a
group of well-known Argentine businessmen, besides several high-
ranking government officials.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will visit during its permanence in China's
Beijing and Shanghai to meet with Chinese authorities and
businessmen, and will attend the 14th meeting of the Argentine-
Chinese joint commission.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia Thursday described the
United Nations Security Council's resolution imposing an arms
embargo on it as " unjust and unfair".
</P>
<P>
The Security Council Wednesday night unanimously adopted the
resolution to impose an arms embargo against Ethiopia and Eritrea
which failed to meet U.N. demand to end border conflict
immediately and resume peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The two Horn of African countries resumed heavy fighting along
their disputed borders on May 12, two years after the conflict
broke out.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Foreign Ministry said in a statement: "As a
matter of principle, the people of Ethiopia condemn, with all
their strength, this unjust and unfair resolution adopted by the
Security Council."
</P>
<P>
The ministry blamed the Security Council for ignoring the fact
that "Ethiopia became, over two years ago, a victim of
aggression".
</P>
<P>
The arms embargo against Ethiopia and Eritrea will remain in
effect for 12 months before the 15-nation Security Council decides
what action to take on the arms ban on the basis of the
implementation of the new resolution.

BRASILIA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso said Thursday that the integration with the South
American countries is one of the challenges of the coming years
for Brazilian diplomacy.

He said in a speech delivered during the graduation ceremony of
the Rio Blanco Institute, the alma mater of the Brazilian
diplomats, that Brazil has invited the South American chiefs of
state to meet in Brasilia in August.

The goal of the South American summit, according to Cardoso, is
to discuss several aspects of integration, especially in the areas

integration.

The Brazilian president said that a lot of important work was
made in the last years to promote the union of the South American

<HEADLINE> China Trusts Panamanians Management of Canal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese people are fully
confident that Panamanians have the capability, wisdom, and
intelligence to manage and administer the Panama Canal in an
efficient manner.
</P>
<P>
This stand was stated Thursday by Li Younglu, the Sino-
Panamanian Trade Development Office representative during the
inaugural ceremony of the new containership line of the China
Ocean Shipping Company (Cosco).
</P>
<P>
Li said that after the recovery of the interoceanic waterway on
December 31, 1999, the Panamanian people became the real owner of
the route.
</P>
<P>
Panamanian First Vice President Arturo Vallarino said that the
new Cosco container ship fleet will not only become a significant
source of income for the canal because of toll payments, but also
contribute to the increase of the Panamanian sea fleet.
</P>
<P>
The new line of container ships has nine container-bearing
ships with a contribution of 104 trips a year across the Panama
Canal.
</P>
<P>
The nine ships are seven of Cosco, which can transport 3,400
tons (TEU, ton equivalent units), one of the Yaming firm, of
Taiwan, and another from Kline, of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The new route goes from the Far East to the United States east
coast, with a saving of seven days, while the container ships
traversed the same route through the Suez Canal, Egypt, in 33 days.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the new route will produce more than 10 million
U.S. dollars in tolls for the interoceanic waterway administered
by the Panama Canal Authority (ACP).
</P>
<P>
The ACP can also obtain more than two million dollars from the
Chinese conglomerate through the sale of fuel to its ships, all
under Panamanian register and of the "Panamax" class, which are
the biggest that can be accommodated by the waterway.
