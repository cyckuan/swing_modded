 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
Clemens may yet become an Astro
<TEXT>
<P>
   To paraphrase Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr., a line in the
sand has been drawn regarding the once-and-future Roger Clemens
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Get it done, or get on with life as the Astros know it, McLane
has said.
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker, the
Clemens trade negotiations might not be hot and heavy, but they are
ongoing with Clemens' current team, the Toronto Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase Clemens' agents, Alan and Randy Hendricks, it has
become a game of wait-and-see. No longer are the superagents
actively involved in contract renegotiations in the midst of trade
talks. It simply will be a deal or no deal that they offer to their
client after the particulars are ironed out.
</P>
<P>
   After all the confusion _ the testy volleys between the sides,
the talk of handshake deals between the Jays and Clemens, the
clandestine phone conversations between McLane and the Hendrickses
_ some of us are wondering how this deal possibly could get done
now.
</P>
<P>
   But really, we should be wondering how it possibly could not get
done. As with Joe DiMaggio, news of this deal's death was greatly
exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   It was bitter and seemingly crippling when Clemens held his
memorable December news conference, pulling out of the bartering
business and pulling no punches when it came to Hunsicker and
Astros president Tal Smith.
</P>
<P>
   But in the strangest twist yet, it appears Clemens' biting
declaration might become the biggest reason the Astros can have
their cherished fireballer _ and on terms more to their liking.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, it has come down to three factors. McLane has refused
to give up on the deal, even after his top two baseball hands were
verbally chopped down by Clemens. The Jays have realized they might
be better off in the clubhouse without Clemens, no matter his
talent. And much of the baseball world realizes it might be wasting
its breath talking trade with Toronto, because Clemens wants to
play in Houston and for a title contender, probably in that order.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know they have to deal him,'' one Toronto source said
Friday of the Blue Jays. ``They know some of their players probably
won't be comfortable with him there this season.''
</P>
<P>
   They know what you should know. Clemens could be an Astro by the
opening of spring training Feb. 17.
</P>
<P>
   From the Astros' perspective, some sort of deal must happen
soon, so the likes of Derek Bell, Scott Elarton and Richard Hidalgo
do not spend the spring wondering about their status with the team.
Chemistry is a fragile thing.
</P>
<P>
   For Toronto, the deal must be made because the disappointment
Clemens has voiced regarding having a championship-caliber
supporting cast has hurt his relationship with the club and the
city. As talented as he is, the Jays are ready for a new direction.
</P>
<P>
   The only question is whether Clemens will go the Astros,
Rangers, Indians or Yankees. When he mentioned recently that St.
Louis was in the mix, it likely only was a calculated way of
tweaking the Astros a bit more, hoping McLane would step up in fear
of a division rival's landing the ace.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a tricky trade for sure, as much after it happens as
during the deal-making. The Astros do not want to mortgage their
future and will work hard toward keeping at least one of Bell,
Elarton and Hidalgo.
</P>
<P>
   McLane also does not want to stab Hunsicker and Smith in their
backs, which is why Hunsicker is the point man in negotiations with
the Blue Jays. In a straight player-for-players deal, Hunsicker
does not have to deal with the Hendrickses and new contracts. He
isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the Astros suddenly are in a preferred position.
When Clemens took his renegotiation card off the table, he made it
a more cut-and-dried negotiation. He made it Hunsicker's
negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   If Clemens does come to Houston, there is no reason for the
Astros to add huge numbers to his contract until after the 1999
season or later (his current deal runs through 2000) _ and even
then more on their terms.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens has made his arrival into camp a stickier proposition if
it happens, but that, too, can be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
   We are reminded of a recent conversation with Rockets star
Scottie Pippen and the issue of Dennis Rodman. Pippen talked of
loving Rodman on the floor, loving his contribution and his
commitment _ on the floor. But he also said he had a business-only
relationship with the Neoned One. Away from the floor, they did not
converse, socialize or exchange much more than a few pleasantries.
And together they won an NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   That's how this deal can work for Hunsicker, Smith and Clemens.
Damage has been done, but it would seem impossible for one side not
to respect what the other can offer.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens and Hunsicker might only exchange a few pleasantries,
but together they can win a World Series championship. And that's
what both sides want more than anything.
</P>

COWBOYS OR COPS? ELITE STREET CRIMES UNIT HAS MIXED REPUTATION 
</HEADLINE>
 (See also NY-SUSPECT-SHOT, NY-SUSPECT-WESTAFRICANS) 
(DW) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For nearly three decades, members of the New York
City Police Department's street crimes unit have patrolled the city
at night in search of crimes about to occur, sometimes making their
appearance scruffy to blend in and driving battered cars as
camouflage.
</P>
<P>
   It has been known as an elite force, and became even more so two
years ago when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Police Commissioner
William Safir announced that the city would nearly quadruple the
force and expand its focus from taking illegal guns off the street
to fighting a number of crimes, from rape to thefts.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the unit has become a hallmark of the aggressive
policing championed by the Giuliani administration and has offered
one avenue for active beat officers to advance through the ranks
and gain a detective shield. But its tactics also have been
criticized by community leaders and other police officers who say
the department should rein in the unit's members, who like to say
they ``own the night.''
</P>
<P>
   The shooting on Thursday of Amadou Diallo, an apparently unarmed
Bronx peddler, by four officers in the unit who were looking for a
rape suspect brought harsh complaints not only from Amnesty
International but also from associations of minority officers in
the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dealing with a critical issue of race in the United
States,'' said a retired police detective, Graham Weatherspoon, who
spoke at a news conference Friday held by a local officers' group,
100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care. ``Three years ago, a man
with a rifle was arrested in midtown Manhattan without a shot being
fired. The man arrested was a male white.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the same news conference, Sidique Abubacarr Wai, the
president of a national advocacy group for members of minorities,
the United African Congress, added: ``Africans are murdered in this
town every month and we are sick and tired of burying our own.''
</P>
<P>
   The street crimes unit has been called upon through the years to
pinpoint and tackle many problems. They have saturated midtown
Manhattan to quell crimes of opportunity during New Year's Eve
celebrations and have been sent to precincts troubled by rashes of
murders, rapes or assaults.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when the unit had only about 100 officers, it was
responsible for 20 percent of all arrests of people carrying
illegal guns in the city, according to police statistics. Since
1997, when the mayor increased its ranks to more than 400 _ still
less than 2 percent of the entire police force _ the unit has been
responsible for nearly 40 percent of all gun arrests annually.
</P>
<P>
   Last Year, Safir singled out the work of the unit, saying that
it had been instrumental in reducing the number of reported
shootings to fewer than 1,000 during the first half of 1998,
compared with 2,500 in the first half of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors, speaking on the condition of anonymity, have
noted that the unit's mission of searching out crimes instead of
responding to them had left some of their arrests vulnerable to
complaints of unlawful search and seizure. Cases have been thrown
out because officers chased suspects without probable cause, only
then finding a gun or other illegal item. ``They have a reputation
as cowboys,'' one prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   Two days ago, a Brooklyn grand jury declined to indict the
rapper Russel Jones, known as Ol' Dirty Bastard in the rap group
Wu-Tang Clan, on charges that he attempted to murder street crime
officers who had stopped his car last month. The officers, who
fired on Jones and another passenger, claimed that the rap
performer had fired first, according to the police. But Jones said
that the officers had been frightened by a cell phone he was
holding when he was stopped.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury found no evidence that Jones had fired at the
police, and he said on Thursday that he planned to file a lawsuit
against the city.

BLAME FOR GIRL'S DEATH OVERSHADOWS SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION SAFETY
HEARING 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Haunted by the death of a 16-year-old girl who was
struck by a brick that fell from one of its construction sites last
year, the leaders of the New York City School Construction
Authority Friday outlined the steps they were taking to prevent
such accidents.
</P>
<P>
   They include replacing all but two of the agency's 30 project
managers and requiring four references from each prospective
contractor.
</P>
<P>
   But their testimony, at a state Assembly hearing in lower
Manhattan, was overshadowed by sparring between the chairman of the
Assembly Education Committee, Steven Sanders, and the governor's
former representative at the authority, Paul Atanasio.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders' insisted that Atanasio take some responsibility for the
events leading to the girl's death.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, a Democrat from the Manhattan's Lower East Side, called
the hearing to address a report by city and authority investigators
in December that found fault at every stage of the renovation of
the school, P.S. 131 in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   They range from the approval of an inexperienced contractor to
the hiring of an unqualified project manager to the failure to
install a protective sidewalk shed that might have saved Yan Zhen
Zhao's life.
</P>
<P>
   The report suggested that Atanasio had persuaded authority
executives to hire his assistant's husband, Gary Marrone, to
oversee the renovation of several schools even though he had little
experience.
</P>
<P>
   One of Marrone's assignments was P.S. 131. Though he was
transferred 82 days before the accident, the report said that the
lax safety he had fostered for more than a year had been a factor
in the accident.
</P>
<P>
   His face red and his hands shaking as he read a statement,
Atanasio took aim at Sanders, who had called the chain of events
leading to the girl's death an outrage that could be traced to
Atanasio.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, Sanders, it is your comments about me that are the
outrage,'' Atanasio said. ``To be sure, there are those who bear
responsibility for the child's death, but to suggest that I am
responsible because the husband of my assistant worked as a project
officer on P.S. 131 is patently untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   Atanasio's anger only rose as Sanders twice addressed him,
apparently inadvertently, as `` Marrone.''
</P>
<P>
   `` Who?'' Atanasio interrupted each time.
</P>
<P>
   Though Atanasio, who resigned after the report's release,
refused to accept blame for the accident, he said that he might
have had more to do with Marrone's hiring than he originally
admitted.
</P>
<P>
   At first he told investigators he had no knowledge of Marrone's
hiring. But Friday he said he could not dispute the claims of four
authority officials that he had intervened on Marrone's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that Marrone should not have been hired by the
authority, though he wondered aloud why the authority had been
unable to secure the site in the nearly three months between
Marrone's removal and the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Before Atanasio's testimony, the authority's president, Milo E.
Riverso, spoke about the many cracks in management the accident had
exposed and the ways the agency had tried to patch them.
</P>
<P>
   He described a new corps of project managers, who function as
the authority's eyes and ears at each job site who are going
through a new course on site safety.
</P>
<P>
   And he said the contractor at P.S. 131, Espo Construction of the
Bronx, which has since pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the girl's
death, would not have made it through the authority's new screening
process since it had supplied no references suggesting it had done
general contracting work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire corporate culture of the SCA has changed,'' Riverso
said.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Albert Vann of Brooklyn was one of several committee
members who praised the changes, but said he doubted that a
nine-year-old agency with such flaws could remake itself in a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to be on your guard,'' Vann said to Riverso.

CLINTON TRIAL WITNESSES OFFER NO NEW EVIDENCE

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The three witnesses called by House managers to
resuscitate the Senate's impeachment trial gave little ground under
questioning and offered no breakthroughs to buttress the perjury
and obstruction of justice charges against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers had hoped the three witnesses that the Senate
allowed them to depose _ Monica S. Lewinsky, Vernon E. Jordan Jr.
and Sidney Blumenthal _ would add new drama to their case . But
their sworn testimony, taken earlier this week and released on
Friday, shows that rather than strengthening or clarifying the
central issues , the witnesses seemed intent on saying little, if
anything, that would give the House managers additional fodder.
</P>
<P>
   Videotaped portions of their testimony will be shown to the
Senate on Saturday, when the trial resumes, giving the public its
first image of Ms. Lewinsky as more than a disembodied voice on
tapes or a silent figure fleeing from a media pack.
</P>
<P>
   The managers failed to persuade the Senate to allow witnesses to
appear in person. After Saturday's presentations by the House
prosecutors and the White House lawyers, the trial will move to
closing arguments on Monday and could be over by late next week.
The failure of the three witnesses to provide new information was
part of the Senate's decision to skip live testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, in particular, repeatedly refused opportunities to
pass judgments on the president, declining to discuss his motives
or to characterize the truthfulness of his prior testimony. While
she said she now had ``mixed feelings'' about Clinton, she would
not elaborate on what her reservations about him were and said she
admired the job he had done as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what you need to know is that my grand jury testimony
is truthful irrespective of whatever those mixed feelings are,''
she responded when pressed to describe her current attitude toward
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republicans had hoped to make Ms. Lewinsky their star
witness, she hewed to her earlier testimony before the independent
counsel Kenneth W. Starr, stating that the president had never told
her to lie and never encouraged her to file a false affidavit in
the sexual misconduct lawsuit filed by Paula Corbin Jones. While
the House managers had hoped the testimony would highlight a
distraught and vulnerable young woman and embarrass Clinton, she
was cool, focused and composed, frequently asking her chief
questioner to sharpen or rephrase his questions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, several senators who have already watched her on tape
said they were struck by her youthfulness, a reminder that the
president had taken advantage of a young aide.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, a Washington lawyer and Clinton confidant, was deemed by
House managers to be pivotal to proving the obstruction-of-justice
charges against the president. But he too disappointed. And his
testimony conflicted with Ms. Lewinsky's when he denied telling her
to destroy copies of notes she had drafted to the president.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers have alleged that the president enlisted
Jordan to help to get a job for Ms. Lewinsky in New York to buy her
silence in the Jones case. Both Ms. Lewinsky and Jordan denied that
the job help was linked to her filing an affidavit in the Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   On several other crucial points, Ms. Lewinsky's testimony
remained at odds with the president's. Last August, Clinton
testified that he told Ms. Lewinsky she would have to turn over
gifts he had given her to the Jones lawyers. Pressed on this point
by Rep. Ed Bryant, the Tennessee Republican who led the House
managers' questioning of the former White House intern, Ms.
Lewinsky replied that she had no recollection of the president
telling her to turn over the gifts. ``Not that I remember,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But she was certain that the president's secretary, Betty
Currie, had initiated the retrieval of the gifts after they were
subpoenaed by the Jones lawyers. The House managers have charged
that Mrs. Currie must have acted at the president's behest, but Ms.
Lewinsky's testimony did little to clarify the point.
</P>
<P>
   In the videotaped testimony Ms. Lewinsky gave at a Washington
hotel on Monday, Ms. Lewinsky told Bryant that Mrs. Currie called
her about the gifts. ``I remember her saying either I know you have
something for me or the president said you have something for me,''
Ms. Lewinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Currie had testified that Ms. Lewinsky initiated the gift
retrieval and the president tesified that he was not concerned
about the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   In the president's defense, Clinton's lawyers have emphasized
that records of the Currie call show it came after the time Ms.
Lewinsky testified the secretary stopped by to get the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky said she could have been mistaken about the time
she received a Mrs. Currie's call.
</P>
<P>
   House managers declined to include Mrs. Currie on their witness
list, fearing she would hurt rather than help their case.
</P>
<P>
   The president also denied touching Ms. Lewinsky in a manner that
fit the definition of sexual relations in the Jones case, a crucial
point in the article of impeachment charging the president with
perjury. Ms. Lewinsky's testimony before the grand jury included
detailed descriptions of her sexual encounters with the president,
with some activity that would have fallen within the Jones
definition of sexual relations.
</P>
<P>
   But when Bryant tried to press Ms. Lewinsky on whether the
president had lied, her lawyers objected and Ms. Lewinsky responded
that she did not ``feel comfortable characterizing whether what he
said was truthful or not truthful,'' adding ``I know I've testified
to what I believe is true.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's largely polished and understated testimony did provide
a moment of drama when he was asked by Rep. Asa Hutchinson, another
House manager, whether he had told Ms. Lewinsky to destroy drafts
and copies of love notes she had written the president.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan coldly told the Arkansas Republican, ``Mr. Hutchinson,
I'm a lawyer and I'm a loyal friend, but I'm not a fool, and the
notion that I would suggest to anybody that they destroy anything
just defies anything that I know about myself. So the notion that I
said to her go home and destroy notes is ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan did confirm that he had a breakfast meeting with Ms.
Lewinsky on Dec. 31, 1997, at which they discussed the notes, an
encounter he did not recall in earlier testimony before the grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
   The third witness, the White House aide Sidney Blumenthal, was
asked about a discussion he had with Clinton shortly after the
Lewinsky scandal broke in the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal testified that the president told him that Ms.
Lewinsky had made sexual demands on him, that he had rebuffed her
and that she told him she was called ``the stalker'' by her peers.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal repeated elements of this conversation to the grand
jury, and the House managers contended that Clinton was trying to
influence his aide's grand jury testimony.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another central episode in the obstruction of justice charges
against the president involves a phone call Clinton made to Ms.
Lewinsky in the middle of the night on Dec. 17, 1997. During the
conversation Clinton informed Ms. Lewinsky that her name was on the
witness list in the Jones case and suggested that she could file an
affidavit to avoid being deposed in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers contend the president encouraged Ms. Lewinsky
to file a false affidavit denying their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   But she gave them no help on this point, insisting that ``there
was no discussion of what would be in the affidavit,'' and adding,
``I don't think I necessarily thought at that point it would have
to be false.''
</P>
<P>
   During one testy exchange with Bryant, Ms. Lewinsky refused to
agree with his premise that it would have been against the
president's interest for Ms. Lewinsky to file a truthful affdavit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really comfortable,'' she responded. ``I mean, I can
tell you what would have been in my best interest, but I ...''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant cut her off with another question, saying, ``But you
didn't file the affidavit in your best interest, did you?`` to
which Ms. Lewinsky responded, ``Uh, actually, I did.''
</P>
<P>
   She did say during her conversation with the president about the
affdavit that she began thinking herself of denying a sexual
relationship, because they had always used ``cover stories'' to
conceal their affair. And while she said the president never told
her to lie, Bryant also asked her whether Clinton had ever
cautioned her to tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that I can recall,'' Ms. Lewinsky responded.
</P>
<P>
   In another exchange with Bryant, Ms. Lewinsky used legalistic
language that was reminiscent of the president's grand jury
testimony. Asked if their cover stories would be misleading to the
Jones lawyers, Ms. Lewinsky responded, ``They were literally true,
but they would be misleading.'' In his grand jury testimony,
Clinton said his goal in the Jones deposition was ``to be truthful,
but not particularly helpful.''

GIULIANI SPEECH IN PENNSYLVANIA DRAWS TRASH PROTESTERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Va., N.J.)  By   JEANNETTE KREBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISBURG, Pa. _ Environmental advocates, angered that trash
from New York is being dumped in Pennsylvania landfills, protested
a visit here Friday night by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen demonstrators, including a man dressed as Benjamin
Franklin, waited outside the the Harrisburg Hilton and Towers,
where Giuliani gave the keynote speech at the Pennsylvania
Republican Committee's annual Lincoln Day Dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mayor Giuliani should stop exporting his problems to other
states,'' said Jeff Schmidt, spokesman for the Pennsylvania chapter
of the Sierra Club. ``When this mayor decided to close New York's
landfill, he bowed to local political pressure. His answer has been
to dump on his neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, state Rep. Todd Eachus, a Democrat, led a
demonstration at the state Capitol in which 50 pounds of office
trash was collected for shipment to Giuliani's office in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania takes in more out-of-state trash than any other
state. Nearly 3.3 million tons of that waste came from New York in
1997, according to the most recent figures from the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the mayor has angered residents of New Jersey
and Virginia and their Republican governors over the issue of New
York City trash that is sent to landfills in those states.
</P>
<P>
   The dozen sign-waving demonstrators never saw the mayor, but he
mentioned them during his remarks to the 700 Republican supporters
who paid $50 each to hear him speak at the dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to see a few protesters out here,'' he said. ``I
felt at home.''

BRUINS MIGHT HAVE HIDDEN GEMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
Leftovers from the recruiting trail and other places ....
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wake them up: Westlake's Mike Seidman, Newhall's Jerry Owens and
Venice's J.P. Losman were familiar names when they signed letters
of intent Wednesday morning. But which lesser-known players may
emerge as contributors, either next season or in the years to come?
</P>
<P>
   Four names to remember:
</P>
<P>
   _Asi Faoa, a linebacker from Magnolia High in Anaheim who did
not register with the ubiquitous recruiting services until
recently. One of his coaches, Richard Penn, played for Bob Toledo
at Pacific and tipped off the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Faoa is 6-foot-4 and 240 pounds, with a wide base and frame that
can hold more weight. The Bruins believe he'll be an impact player,
if not in 1999 then soon thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   _Ryan Wikert, a safety from Temecula Valley High. At least one
recruiting service, Student Sports, believes he's the sleeper in
UCLA's highly ranked class. He is 6-2, 175 pounds and ran a
4.5-second 40-yard dash for the coaches. One other thing: He's a
hitter, and the Bruins need all the physicality they can find.
</P>
<P>
   _Mat and David Ball, twin defensive ends from Dixon, Calif.
Mention the word ``twins'' around Westwood, and the nice, polite
Webb brothers, Josh and Micah, come to mind. But the Balls, 6-5 and
235 pounds, are fearless and athletic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're excellent basketball players,'' Toledo said. ``And
they have a mean streak in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Close second: UCLA strengthened its position as a national
recruiting power by finishing second on four elite out-of-state
players:
</P>
<P>
   T.J. Duckett, a linebacker from Kalamazoo, Mich., who is
considered the nation's No. 1 overall player and signed with
Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Breedlove, perhaps the nation's No. 1 offensive lineman,
from Central, S.C., who signed with Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Milligan, another top offensive lineman from Norcross, Ga.,
who signed with Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Arnold, the Seattle tailback who signed with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Time to mature: Don't expect Owens, the Hart High receiver, to
play immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Decisions on redshirts are made once training camp begins, but
Owens has a slew of experienced players to overtake: Danny Farmer,
Brian Poli-Dixon, Freddie Mitchell, Brad Melsby, Jon Dubravac and
redshirt Paul Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We targeted (Owens) a long time ago,'' Toledo said. ``We knew
he was outstanding. He's a great student and a great person. He
fits the mold of our program. But he needs to get bigger and
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Staying put?: It appears offensive coordinator Al Borges will
return for the 1999 season. He was a candidate for the same post
with San Diego, but a source said Borges and Chargers coach Mike
Riley had a philosophical difference: They both wanted to call the
plays.
</P>
<P>
   Borges' challenge from spring practice to training camp and
through the season is hefty: identify and develop a starting
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Five players will compete for Cade McNown's job when spring
practice begins April 6: junior-to-be Drew Bennett, sophomore Scott
McEwan, redshirt freshmen Ryan McCann and Cory Paus, and Losman,
the incoming freshman.

LAWYERS FOR 5 JAIL GUARDS SAY CLIENTS ARE UNJUSTLY DEMONIZED 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ Lawyers for five guards at the Nassau County
jail who were transferred last month after the death of an inmate
lashed out at the news media Friday, saying their clients were
unjustly being depicted as murderous brutes and would eventually be
exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to tell you that correction officers are not
monsters,'' said Edward P. Jenks, a lawyer for Ivano Bavaro, a
guard who was working in an area of the jail where Thomas Pizzuto,
the inmate who later died, had been held.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials have said Pizzuto, 38, was savagely
beaten on Jan. 8 while serving the second day of a 90-day sentence
for traffic violations, then left in his cell, bleeding internally,
without treatment. He died five days later of a lacerated spleen,
and his death has been ruled a homicide. No charges have been
filed.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn, which has taken control
of the investigation, also has begun a civil rights inquiry into
widespread allegations of abuse of inmates by guards at the Nassau
jail, in East Meadow, N.Y.. Such allegations have been commonplace
during the last decade, officials say, but only one resulted in a
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Peace, the lawyer for Patrick Regnier, another correction
officer who was transferred after the death of Pizzuto, called such
reports overblown. Peace said he had been practicing criminal law
in Nassau County since 1962 and could not recall any client
complaining of physical abuse inside the jail.
</P>
<P>
   Peace backed away, however, from an earlier claim that his own
interviews with other prisoners suggested that an inmate might have
beaten Pizzuto. No inmate said that, Pease said.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that he had reached his initial conclusion ``by
process of elimination:'' since the guards on duty had not attacked
Pizzuto, he said he reasoned, no one but another inmate could have.
</P>
<P>
   The other guards who have been reassigned to duties that do not
involve contact with inmates are Edward Velasquez, a guard who was
working on the tier where Pizzuto was being held; Gary Pincus, a
corporal on that tier, and Joseph Bergen, another corporal.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Barber, president of the Civil Service Employees
Association bargaining unit for jail guards, said the five guards
had exemplary records. None have ever been disciplined or been the
subject of an inmate complaint, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Anthony Pizzuto, the victim's brother, said: ``What their
records are doesn't matter. It's what happened that day that
matters. My brother was still murdered.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his family was clinging to the hope that all those
culpable would be brought to justice. ``Not just the ones who beat
my brother,'' he added, ``but who saw my brother and did nothing.''

BASKETBALL COLUMN: SAME OLD QUESTIONS FOR NEW OLD KNICKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ How do you win a National Basketball Association
championship with Patrick Ewing?
</P>
<P>
   This has been the New York Knicks' million-dollar question for
14 seasons. The attempts to answer it, which have cost the
organization millions as well, have been slow in coming. With Ewing
as the dominant force and focal point, the Man, the Knicks have
come close a couple of times and have generally been entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   But the championship that Knicks fans crave has been beyond
their grasp. And Friday night's 93-85 loss to the Orlando Magic
seemed to push it even further away.
</P>
<P>
   This season marks the Knicks' most dramatic, most desperate step
in years to find the answer. They have reconfigured the team, cast
out the bruising, staccato halfcourt pounding in favor of a
smaller, quicker, guerrilla-warfare-type attack.
</P>
<P>
   But the question remains: How do you win an NBA championship
with Patrick Ewing? Because whatever the Knicks do must pass
through Ewing. The paradox of the Knicks' situation is that while
they have not been able to win a championship with Ewing, they will
never win one without him.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks opened a new season Friday night. For the 36-year-old
Ewing, who scored 17 points on 7-of-13 shooting, the season begins
much as it ended, with renewed clarion calls for him to step back,
accept a reduced role on the so-called New Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has a laundry list of what Ewing needs to do: take
fewer shots, play better defense, grab more rebounds, abdicate the
scorer's role. That's fine, as far as it goes, and that's precisely
the problem: We don't know how far it will go.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk about the new Knicks' firepower, all the Knicks
have at this juncture is theoretic firepower. Latrell Sprewell, who
scored 24 Friday night, hadn't played NBA competition since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Houston (12 points) is just coming into his own as a
confident, forceful front-line player. Larry Johnson (10 points) is
an undersized power forward. Marcus Camby, the third prong to the
New Knick attack, has been dismal and didn't even play Friday
night. Houston, Sprewell and Johnson shot a combined 18-43 for 46
points.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing has begun to accept a new role with the Knicks, though if
he has a few more nights like this, he may go back to his old self,
with the fans' blessing. Much of it has been forced on him by age,
aching knees and a weakened wrist.
</P>
<P>
   But he has also begun to listen to his teammates. ``His role is
changing and the players want his role to change,'' Orlando's Penny
Hardaway said Friday. ``I hear their interviews, and if you read
between the lines, his teammates are saying it very subtly. Now
it's 15 players to one, not like it's 50-50. Everybody is saying,
`Pat, you have to change.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Hardaway also said that without Ewing, the Knicks are a ship
adrift. Whatever misery fans think they have endured is nothing
compared with what they will be left with when there is no Ewing.
Just a few years ago Hardaway was throwing lob passes to Shaquille
O'Neal. The Magic beat the Bulls in the Eastern Conference Finals
and played for the NBA championship. Then the organization allowed
Shaq to leave, and everyone's life has been miserable.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a player like Shaq or Patrick or Kareem, you go
into every game knowing you can win,'' Hardaway said. ``We knew
Shaq was going to give us 30, that meant all we had to do was do
our jobs. That gives you a whole lot of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Magic, like the Knicks, is being reconfigured. While the
Magic is grooming Ike Austin as its center of the future, the
Knicks, who do not have a center of the future, are watching Ewing
play off into the sunset. As long as Ewing is in the lineup _
rebounding, trailing, scoring _ the Knicks know they have a chance
to win.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the focus on Ewing, this is perhaps an even more
defining season for Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy. This is a new
Knicks team, nothing like the Pat Riley-bred grind 'em up Knicks.
The 37-year-old Van Gundy _ stripped of his training wheels, John
Starks and Charles Oakley _ has formulated a bold new style of play
for the Knicks, a style based on speed, quickness, aggressiveness
and scoring.
</P>
<P>
   The new scheme needs a safety net, a rebounder, a defensive
presence. That is what Ewing will provide. That is what Ewing has
always provided. Friday night, Ewing led the team nine rebounds.
``I felt pretty good,'' Ewing said after the game. ``I got a little
winded, but over all I felt pretty good. We just got our butts
beat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He will be the foundation of the team as long as he's here,''
Van Gundy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players have come and gone,'' he added. ``Coaches have come
and gone, management has come and gone. That's why he's still here
_ because he's the cornerstone.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all well and good. But there is still that million-dollar
question: How do you win an NBA championship with Patrick Ewing?

EDITORIAL: CHELSEA CLINTON'S PRIVACY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(SUBS grafs 2 &AMP; 4 for editorial refinements. No other changes.)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Feb. 6:
</P>
<P>
   It was Teddy Roosevelt, that exuberant personality, who first
threw open the door to life at the White House. His children all
became celebrities of the age. It was Woodrow Wilson who slammed
the door, threatening to shun any reporter who wrote about his
daughters. The door stayed shut, guarded by fathers like Harry
Truman, until the Kennedy children became symbols of a youthful
presidency, objects of public adoration, and then of heartbreak.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson daughters, the Nixon daughters, Amy Carter all had
painful public moments. But no one knows the pain of life in the
White House better than Chelsea Clinton, and few first families
have been more protective than her parents. For six years,
reporters have largely honored their request to respect Ms.
Clinton's privacy. In that time, she has matured into a poised
young woman.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, as well, the White House has put her on
display at politically opportune moments and in structured
situations. She has traveled with the first lady, sat with her at
the Democratic National Convention in 1996 and attended church at
awkward moments with her father, and was the physical link between
her parents, holding their hands as they left for Martha's Vineyard
after his admission of a relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   This brief review of the coverage of Chelsea Clinton is useful
in assessing the flap over a People magazine cover article on her.
Her parents' reaction of ``profound sadness'' seems overwrought
when compared with the respectful, almost puffy tone of the piece.
</P>
<P>
   Their fear, no doubt, is that the floodgates will be opened now.
We doubt that the mainstream press will abandon the current policy
of restraint. That policy has produced generally appropriate
reporting of Ms. Clinton's public activities and allows for
journalistic interest in the personal and family dynamics of a
White House gripped by crisis.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case during Watergate and, perhaps to a lesser
extent, in the current scandal. The People story, like much of the
magazine's fare, was opportunistic but soft. It will not cause
responsible newspapers and broadcasters to start snooping into
Chelsea Clinton's private life.

BUSS WOULD LOVE IT IF RODMAN JOINED IN FUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Del Harris is staying (for now), Dennis
Rodman isn't coming (probably) and Jerry Buss has no intention of
selling the Los Angeles Lakers (not yet, anyway).
</P>
<P>
   So said Buss himself, when the Lakers' majority owner sat down
for a wide-ranging, half-hour interview with reporters prior to
Friday's NBA season opener at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   The pursuit of Rodman, the colorful and controversial rebounding
whiz, has been a personal mission for Buss, who has befriended the
former Chicago Bulls star. But with the Lakers able to offer only
the $1 million veteran's minimum salary _ prorated to $610,000 for
the short season _ Buss figures Rodman will choose retirement and
an acting career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's looking doubtful,'' said Buss, sitting at his desk, with
the Lakers' five NBA championship trophies behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``How interested was I? I was very interested. Dennis is someone
who could give us rebounding like we have never had at that
position. He's a true talent. And I was just hoping somehow that if
he chose a team, it would be us. I know he wants to play here, but
everybody always gets caught in the (salary) cap problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``A player of his talent, it would be tough for him to play for
that kind of money. If he plays and plays for that kind of money, I
just hope it's here. ... He would have to do it strictly for the
idea of winning a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Rodman's talents are always accompanied by distractions _
his flamboyant lifestyle, his penchant for skipping practices, the
occasional profane outburst _ he also was viewed as the possible
missing piece to the Lakers' championship hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Buss realizes not everyone wants Rodman in a Lakers uniform, but
said: ``You can't please everybody. Some people don't even like the
Laker Girls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I can read he public, they want to win (the
championship) badly, and I want to win it,'' he said. ``Los Angeles
is very hungry for a championship. It's been a while. We had such a
glorious run back in the Kareem-Magic days that people are hungry.
They miss that.''
</P>
<P>
   If Rodman does become a Laker, it will be with no strings
attached to his personality or lifestyle, said Buss, who knows
Rodman ``because we tend to habit the same places.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis is Dennis,'' he said. ``You're not about to tell Dennis
how to be someone else. You take him the way he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman's talent agency, International Creative Management, could
not be reached for comment Friday evening but earlier said he
continues to weigh his options. No other NBA teams have outwardly
expressed interest in Rodman, and several have turned him down.
</P>
<P>
   ICM is attempting to make the Lakers deal work by obtaining
entertainment work for Rodman, which would make up for the
relatively low NBA salary he'd earn. And his value as a movie star
is higher if he maintains a high profile through basketball, Buss
noted.
</P>
<P>
   So he holds out some hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not over until the fat lady sings,'' Buss said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Harris, entering his fifth season as coach and the
last year of his contract, will work the entire season without an
extension. Buss praised Harris' work but said he did not consider
giving Harris a new deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't come up,'' he said of an extension. ``It just
doesn't come up in discussion, so there is no decision. Overall, I
think Del's done a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Buss has sold shares of the Lakers to a number of
parties, including media mogul and Dodgers owner Rupert Murdoch, he
said he has no intention of giving up ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see selling the Lakers. I'm afraid of my children,''
he quipped.
</P>
<P>
   When he does decide to step away from day-to-day operations,
Buss' plan will be to turn over business operations to daughter
Jeanie Buss, now president of the Forum, and basketball operations
to son Jim Buss, now an assistant general manager.
</P>
<P>
   But sell the team? Only if the offer is right.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did that guy (Murdoch) pay for that soccer club in
England?'' Buss said.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch paid $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, the Lakers are twice as valuable as that,'' Buss said
with a smile, then joked, ``Hear me, Mr. Murdoch? ... It would take
about a billion.''

FOR OLOWOKANDI, IT COULDN'T BE ANY WORSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hey, Michael Olowokandi .... You decided
basketball looked like a good time, so you left England about four
years ago and enrolled at the University of the Pacific. Three
years later, you were chosen by the Los Angeles Clippers with the
first pick in the 1998 NBA draft, you learned low-post secrets from
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar during the lockout, then you bolted for Italy
when the NBA season appeared doomed. Now you're back in the United
States, preparing for your very first NBA game. Any concerns?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it won't be as bad,'' said the 7-foot rookie an hour
before his first NBA tipoff, ``as that first game at Pacific. I
think that one was an exhibition game.''
</P>
<P>
   How'd it turn out?
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say it was an experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Still looking out for No. 1: The Clippers also had the first
pick in the 1988 draft, selecting Kansas All-American and current
Phoenix super-sub Danny Manning. Manning, beginning his fifth
season with the Suns, spent 5{ seasons with the Clippers before
getting shipped to Atlanta for Dominique Wilkins in 1994. The NBA's
reigning Sixth Man of the Year, Manning has recovered from a third
major knee surgery and scored 30 points last week in two exhibition
victories over Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Local favorite Suns: Friday's Sports Arena visit also was a
homecoming for the Suns' two rookie guards, Toby Bailey and Gerald
Brown. Bailey, a 6-foot-5 off-guard from UCLA, was chosen in the
second round (45th overall) of last year's NBA draft. A lingering
hamstring injury to Rex Chapman means Bailey will be tossed into
the fire early. Bailey scored 15 points and had 12 rebounds in two
exhibition games against Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, an undrafted free agent from Pepperdine, will begin the
season backing up Jason Kidd at point guard. Brown scored 21 points
in the two Dallas games.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Rebel with a cause: When training camp opened two weeks ago,
the only person on the Clippers payroll who expected Tyrone Nesby
to be at the Sports Arena and in uniform for the opener was ...
Tyrone Nesby.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth,'' said the undrafted rookie forward
from Nevada-Las Vegas, ``I always thought I could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   When he wasn't picked in last year's NBA draft, Nesby went to
the Continental Basketball Association, playing 25 games with the
Sioux Falls Skyforce before getting invited to a Clippers tryout.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably been the biggest surprise in camp,'' coach Chris
Ford said. ``Nez backs down to no one. He goes out there and makes
things happen. I wouldn't hesitate to use him early.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second of the Clippers' exhibition games with the Lakers,
Nesby scored 11 points in just 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I deserve to be here,'' he said. ``There were a lot of
guys who were drafted when I thought I should be, so that's what
motivates me.''

<P>
   For the first time since the dispute over Kosovo turned bloody a
year ago, it is possible to imagine _ though not, with any
confidence, to predict _ a turn for the better.
</P>
<P>
   So long as the West is firm enough in its brandishing of sticks
and carrots, Serbs and Kosovars may soon be browbeaten into a
compromise that neither side much likes.
</P>
<P>
   Under a deal now in prospect, the province's Albanian-speaking
majority would be freed from the harsh grip of the Serbs, but not,
at least for three years, allowed to secede.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign mediators would be given wide-ranging powers as they
prepared Kosovo for elections. And, just possibly, Europe might
feel a bit better about its capacity to cool the Balkan cauldron.
</P>
<P>
   Not that any cooling will be all Europe's doing. If agreement is
reached at talks near Paris next week, it will be the result,
largely, of unity of purpose among America and its main European
allies.
</P>
<P>
   And if the peace-broking effort fails, it will probably be
because the Serbs, Kosovars or both have spotted differences of
emphasis between the western powers that they can use to wriggle
off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   Already a modicum of transatlantic consensus has moved
deliberations over Kosovo's future into much higher gear. Almost
certainly, the province would still be cascading towards war if the
United States had not decided, last month, to harness its European
partners' support while promising to share, in a reasonable way,
the responsibility for enforcing any agreement.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's experience since the collapse of the Soviet Union has
driven home some important truths, painfully learned in Bosnia,
about the sort of cooperation needed to fight regional fires in the
alliance's backyard.
</P>
<P>
   First, America's preponderance in the use of air power is so
huge that a serious show of willingness to use it can concentrate
the mind of almost any local bully. At a stroke, the threatened or
actual use of precision bombing can sharply tilt the balance of
power in any regional conflict, without much risk for the user.
</P>
<P>
   But the second axiom that NATO has rediscovered is that bombs
alone cannot build multi-ethnic societies, soothe intercommunal
hatred or even protect people from its effects.
</P>
<P>
   Whether in Bosnia or Kosovo, these complex tasks require ground
troops _ not to arbitrate in a full-scale war, as the U.N. tried to
do in Sarajevo, but to shore up cease-fires, decommission weapons,
nip provocations in the bud and rebuild confidence in small, subtle
ways.
</P>
<P>
   European soldiers tend to be better for these purposes than
Americans, not least because American voters have become so
reluctant to see their compatriots die in far-off places where they
see no vital interest.
</P>
<P>
   A third axiom, less often articulated, is that in many such
places the only alternative to deploying peacekeepers in decent
numbers is a brutally enforced exchange of population _ another way
of saying ethnic cleansing. This flies in the face of all the
principles that western governments proclaim.
</P>
<P>
   Togetherness has a price In an ideal world, peacemaking by
American aircraft and peacekeeping by European troops would
complement one another neatly. But things have never been that
simple, and they will not be in Kosovo either.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, threats by NATO to use air power carry much
greater weight if they involve a genuine coalition _ led, perhaps,
by the United States but with more than a token European
contribution.
</P>
<P>
   That, incidentally, is why European governments should spend
money on improving their own ability to use air power efficiently,
with or without American support.
</P>
<P>
   Nor should Europe be left entirely alone to face the risks of
deploying troops in Kosovo's harsh terrain. At the very least, a
peacekeeping force in Kosovo will need American logistics, American
intelligence and an American guarantee of extraction from danger.
</P>
<P>
   American help could, however, be even more valuable: a small
contribution to any ground force would send a clear signal to local
warriors that the force could not be harmed with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration will have difficulty getting Congress
to agree to send even a limited number of ground troops: skeptical
congressmen are keen to drop bombs but hate putting soldiers in
harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the administration can win the day, especially if it
does not present the proposal in a partisan manner; at least some
Republicans are sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, Europe should get the help it needs to
stabilize Kosovo, this time. But Europeans should not be fooled by
the news this week that America proposes to spend an extra $112
billion on defense over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Among the various claims on that money _ pay rises, anti-missile
defenses, cyber-warfare _ European peacekeeping ranks low.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO's 50th anniversary summit will doubtless declare in
April, burden-sharing in the alliance is more important than ever.
But its survival, in Kosovo and elsewhere, may depend on Europe's
willingness to pay a bigger share of the bill. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Just possibly, you may have missed the latest scandal to befall
the scandal-mired government of Washington, D.C. It happened like
this: as Marshall Brown, an aide to the mayor, was discussing
budget matters with David Howard, the public advocate, he thought
he heard him say ``nigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who is black, stormed out of the room before Howard, who
is white, could explain that what he had said was: ``I will have to
be niggardly with this fund.''
</P>
<P>
   But Howard did the decent thing: he offered to resign, and the
mayor accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Quite right. As one reader told us long ago, ``niggardly'' has
no place in civilized discourse.
</P>
<P>
   The dictionary assures us that it has nothing to do with the
Latin niger, black, meaning only ``miserly'' in Old Norse; but as a
former head of the National Bar Association asked the New York
Times, ``Do we really know where the Norwegians got the word?''
</P>
<P>
   Good point. They'd already discovered America, hadn't they?
Straight off the longship on to the Bronx Expressway, and who knows
what they heard through those horns on their helmets.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it turns up in Middle English, too,'' you protest, ``as
nig and nog, meaning miser.'' Right: so racism was alive and well
in the era of Sir Gawain. Who do you imagine was actually sent to
lif' dat Grail?
</P>
<P>
   Some words, let's admit it, are just too offensive for their own
good. Some condemn themselves; but others pose as perfectly
harmless, capable of being slipped by bigots into every
conversation. These need watching; for the n-word is only the tip
of the iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   Videotapes from other city offices over the years show a Latina
councilwoman, Laetitia Gonzales, bursting into tears when a
colleague described her dress as Day-glo pink; the first openly
lesbian sub-accountant, Ms. Wilkins, resigning when the budget
director pointed out a dichotomy in her spreadsheets; and the gay
information czar, Roger Pringle, refusing point-blank to sit
beneath a sign reading ``Queries.''
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all was the incident late last year when the
sub-director of pothole maintenance, having groaned ``Not juice
again!'' as his secretary brought his breakfast, was sacked for
anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   Despicable incidents of this sort should clearly be avoided. But
there you go again; ``despicable'' itself contains a slur on
Americans of Mexican extraction.
</P>
<P>
   The Economist has been told off for that, too; again, quite
right. Despicable should never be used in public situations;
conspicuous should be conspicuous by its absence; and all who are
at all perspicacious will lament the presence of these words in our
language.
</P>
<P>
   It's all the fault of those damned Romans, who could never have
run their empire without the help of all those illegal dishwashers
and cleaners they so casually insulted with almost every verb they
coined.
</P>
<P>
   By exposing and shaming the users of such words, the Washington
mayor's office has done the world a service. The Economist believes
it should do no less to keep the language spick and span.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than denigrating racial, religious or life-style choices,
rather than niggling and nipping at the differences between us, we
should take the higher path, and our readers should write to us
every time we fail.
</P>
<P>
   Those with the longest list of gratuitous slurs will receive a
copy of the Oxford English Dictionary reduced, by judicious
expurgation, to the size of a Filofax. That should put our writers
in a paddy. &QL;

<P>
   Just possibly, you may have missed the latest scandal to befall
the scandal-mired government of Washington, D.C. It happened like
this: as Marshall Brown, an aide to the mayor, was discussing
budget matters with David Howard, the public advocate, he thought
he heard him say ``nigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who is black, stormed out of the room before Howard, who
is white, could explain that what he had said was: ``I will have to
be niggardly with this fund.''
</P>
<P>
   But Howard did the decent thing: he offered to resign, and the
mayor accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Quite right. As one reader told us long ago, ``niggardly'' has
no place in civilized discourse.
</P>
<P>
   The dictionary assures us that it has nothing to do with the
Latin niger, black, meaning only ``miserly'' in Old Norse; but as a
former head of the National Bar Association asked the New York
Times, ``Do we really know where the Norwegians got the word?''
</P>
<P>
   Good point. They'd already discovered America, hadn't they?
Straight off the longship on to the Bronx Expressway, and who knows
what they heard through those horns on their helmets.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it turns up in Middle English, too,'' you protest, ``as
nig and nog, meaning miser.'' Right: so racism was alive and well
in the era of Sir Gawain. Who do you imagine was actually sent to
lif' dat Grail?
</P>
<P>
   Some words, let's admit it, are just too offensive for their own
good. Some condemn themselves; but others pose as perfectly
harmless, capable of being slipped by bigots into every
conversation. These need watching; for the n-word is only the tip
of the iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   Videotapes from other city offices over the years show a Latina
councilwoman, Laetitia Gonzales, bursting into tears when a
colleague described her dress as Day-glo pink; the first openly
lesbian sub-accountant, Ms. Wilkins, resigning when the budget
director pointed out a dichotomy in her spreadsheets; and the gay
information czar, Roger Pringle, refusing point-blank to sit
beneath a sign reading ``Queries.''
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all was the incident late last year when the
sub-director of pothole maintenance, having groaned ``Not juice
again!'' as his secretary brought his breakfast, was sacked for
anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   Despicable incidents of this sort should clearly be avoided. But
there you go again; ``despicable'' itself contains a slur on
Americans of Mexican extraction.
</P>
<P>
   The Economist has been told off for that, too; again, quite
right. Despicable should never be used in public situations;
conspicuous should be conspicuous by its absence; and all who are
at all perspicacious will lament the presence of these words in our
language.
</P>
<P>
   It's all the fault of those damned Romans, who could never have
run their empire without the help of all those illegal dishwashers
and cleaners they so casually insulted with almost every verb they
coined.
</P>
<P>
   By exposing and shaming the users of such words, the Washington
mayor's office has done the world a service. The Economist believes
it should do no less to keep the language spick and span.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than denigrating racial, religious or life-style choices,
rather than niggling and nipping at the differences between us, we
should take the higher path, and our readers should write to us
every time we fail.
</P>
<P>
   Those with the longest list of gratuitous slurs will receive a
copy of the Oxford English Dictionary reduced, by judicious
expurgation, to the size of a Filofax. That should put our writers
in a paddy. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, IOWA _ The drug czar, Barry McCaffrey, is
unequivocal: ``The worst drug ever to hit America is
methamphetamine.''
</P>
<P>
   He may well be right. Methamphetamine _ meth, speed, ice, glass,
crank, poor man's cocaine _ is a powerful stimulant that affects
the body in much the same way as cocaine. But it is cheaper than
coke, produces a longer high, and is spreading like wildfire.
</P>
<P>
   Although total drug abuse in America has fallen steadily since
the mid-1980s, and cocaine's share is down 75 percent from its peak
in 1985, the number of methamphetamine overdoses and deaths in the
United States tripled between 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken hold especially in rural areas where other drugs
are less widely available and ``cookers'' can manufacture the stuff
in clandestine laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   When Vice-President Al Gore visited Iowa in January, he spoke
about three issues: pigs, Social Security and methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this stuff so nasty? To begin with, a $50 investment
at the supermarket can produce $3,000-worth of methamphetamine. The
active ingredient is either ephedrine or pseudoephedrine, both of
which are found in over-the-counter cold medicines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cookers'' use products such as drain cleaners, lithium
batteries and engine-starter fluid to transform one of the chemical
precursors into a powder that can be smoked, snorted, injected or
drunk with a soda.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe is on the Internet. The Iowa Division of Narcotics
Enforcement busted 320 meth labs in 1998, up from 63 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Meth metabolizes slowly, and can stay active in the body for up
to 12 hours. The result is a prolonged burst of energy and
strength.
</P>
<P>
   Many Midwestern abusers are workers trying to get through a
double shift at the meat-packing plant or a long haul in the truck.
</P>
<P>
   High-school students are a growing market: the girls try meth to
lose weight, the boys to enhance their athletic and sexual prowess.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking meth may be cheap and easy, but there is nothing safe
about it. A quart of ether (drained from cans of starter fluid) can
explode with the force of five sticks of dynamite.
</P>
<P>
   According to McCaffrey, one in six meth labs explodes or burns
up each year. Those that do not combust are just as dangerous.
Every pound of methamphetamine leaves behind five to six pounds of
toxic waste.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa law-enforcement officials spend roughly $5,000 cleaning up
every lab they close down.
</P>
<P>
   Meth addicts become paranoid, delusional and violent. Cookers
tend to be heavily armed; their laboratories are sometimes
booby-trapped.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study in Iowa found that methamphetamine is a
contributing factor in 80 percent of all domestic violence cases.
Hospital emergency rooms must deal with overdoses in which the
abuser stays psychotic for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the boom in home brewing, Iowa officials estimate that
80 percent of the methamphetamine sold in the state is still being
smuggled in from Mexico or the Southwest, where it is manufactured
in giant ``superlabs.''
</P>
<P>
   This trade used to be run by motorcycle gangs, but in the late
1980s Mexican drug rings began moving much larger quantities of
meth along existing drug routes.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to stop it, state and federal authorities have
increased the penalties for making, using and selling
methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   Shopkeepers help by limiting sales of cold-medicine or tipping
off the authorities when customers make suspicious purchases. One
``cooker'' was busted in Des Moines after he bought $500-worth of
lithium batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa is running television commercials warning against the false
allure of methamphetamine. ``We can't arrest our way out of the
problem,'' says one top drug-enforcement official. The best way is
still to stop people before they start.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most worrying part is not where methamphetamine has
got to in America, but where it can still go.
</P>
<P>
   Outside California, America's big cities have been largely
unaffected. In 1998, the Drug Enforcement Administration's office
in Springfield, Ill., made nearly ten times as many amphetamine
arrests as the Chicago office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised it hasn't come yet,'' says Joseph Vanacora, the
agent in charge of the Chicago office. It probably will, and the
result could be devastating. &QL;

STEVE FORBES: THE GOP'S NERDY NUDZH  
 
</HEADLINE>
   (This excellent 1,000-word ``separate buy'' profile of Steve Forbes
is from the current (week beginning 30 January 1999) Economist
magazine.)

<P>
   Silly slogans are the early-warning signals of an election
season, and the recent Conservative Political Action Conference was
full of them.
</P>
<P>
   T-shirts proclaimed ``Bauer Power'' in honor of powerless Gary
Bauer, a long-shot presidential aspirant. A stall sold Gore Blend
coffee, bland-tasting and decaffeinated. Stickers exhorted
conference-goers to ``Pave the Rainforest'' and ``Save the Male'';
another said, ``Don't steal, the government hates competition.''
</P>
<P>
   From all this pageantry, two conclusions flow. The first is that
the Republican primaries will be fun. The second is that the
ebullient clashes that they bring will be especially fun for
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   This second conclusion is reinforced by the contemplation of
Steve Forbes, one of several presidential hopefuls at this month's
conservative conference.
</P>
<P>
   At first sight, there is nothing fun about Forbes. His campaign
pamphlet, entitled ``A Strategy for America's Future,'' says
unfunny and unconvincing things like ``Tie the value of the dollar
to a fixed measure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes campaign sticker says, boringly, FORBES; Forbes aides
say scintillating things such as, ``Steve is a real decent
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes himself has a nervous, wide-eyed stare, like an
accountant who has been plucked from the comforting tedium of his
spreadsheets and plonked before the TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for Democrats at least, the Forbes campaign affords a
cruel kind of humor. It is pointed and pointless at the same time:
it skewers other Republican hopefuls, but its own candidate seems
too gauche to make it to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts of Forbes, and others like him, ensure that
Republicans will spend much of the coming year beating each other
about the head. Meanwhile, on the Democratic side, Vice-President
Al Gore seems likely (for the time being, at least) to face barely
any serious primary opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes's speech to this month's conservative powwow gave a taste
of head-beatings to come. He railed against ``professional
politicians'' and the ``Republican establishment'' _ meaning his
own party's best candidates for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   He poured scorn upon ``the Washington political class and its
media pets'' _ meaning, presumably, Senator John McCain, a
telegenic Republican war hero who has expressed an interest in the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   And, repeatedly, Forbes denounced worn-out names from Republican
campaigns past, as well as the scions of political families.
</P>
<P>
   This was a way of lancing three rivals at once: Elizabeth Dole,
the wife of the Republican nominee in 1996; Dan Quayle, a former
vice-president; and, most of all, Governor George Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is the most charming and best-financed Republican around;
he runs America's second-most populous state; he is his party's
best hope of recapturing the White House. So Forbes strained
especially hard to damage him.
</P>
<P>
   He sneered at ex-President Bush, the father of the governor.
Daddy Bush promised a ``kinder and gentler'' conservatism; Forbes
lampooned the ``siren song of these mushy moderates.''
</P>
<P>
   Daddy Bush broke a promise not to raise taxes; Forbes boasted
that he comes from ``a family of tax-payers, not tax-raisers.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the younger Bush's talk of ``compassionate
conservatism,'' Forbes had this to say: ``Mealy-mouthed rhetoric
and poll-tested cliches are no substitute for a muscular,
substantive agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Forbes is not alone in his assault on Bush; other
Republican White House wannabes have gathered around, forming a
circular firing squad.
</P>
<P>
   The ``compassionate conservatism'' slogan is nothing more than
``weasel words,'' according to Lamar Alexander, the former
education secretary under President Bush; it is ``silly and
insulting,'' according to Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   But, of all the assailants, Forbes matters most. Despite his
gauche manner, he is the only one with the oomph to wound the
younger Bush seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes matters, first, because of money. He is the heir to the
Forbes publishing empire, and is prepared to spend his own millions
on his campaign. In 1996 Forbes entered the primaries late, and
spent his way to victory in two minor states. This time he will be
more formidable by far.
</P>
<P>
   He has been campaigning nonstop these past three years: he has
visited all 50 states, given more than 400 speeches, paid for 60
radio ad campaigns, and deluged journalists across the land with
tiresome press releases.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Forbes fortune will count for more than it did
last time around. The big-state primaries will happen almost
simultaneously in 2000, rather than being spread out, as they were
in 1996. This will make it impossible to campaign much in person:
expensive television ads will matter more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another reason why the Forbes campaign may
seriously wound Bush. The Texas governor may be charming, and
spectacularly good at the sweaty job of working crowds; but he is
short on striking policy proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, by contrast, is full of bold ideas. As in 1996, he wants
to scrap the tax code and replace it with a 17 percent flat tax,
free of loopholes and complex exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   As in 1996, he wants to replace health and pension entitlement
programs with individual savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In foreign policy, he delights hard-core Republicans by
denouncing multilateral institutions such as the IMF and the United
Nations, and by rekindling Ronald Reagan's enthusiasm for a
ballistic defense system.
</P>
<P>
   He is staunchly conservative on social issues: he opposes
abortion; he denounces euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, in sum, has ideas to please his party's social and
economic wings: he talks excitedly about ``rebuilding the Reagan
coalition.''
</P>
<P>
   If he were a charismatic man, he might well pull this off. But
he is too nerdy, and his inherited wealth makes him a disastrous
messenger for a reform that would abolish taxation on investments.
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates _ governors and senators and former cabinet
members _ will assail the politically inexperienced Forbes for
regarding the presidency as an entry-level job.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a miracle, he will never make it to the White House. But
he may manage to wound his party rivals enough to ensure that none
of them gets there either. &QL;

KNICKS OPEN A NEW SEASON WITH SAME OLD LIABILITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ With his team getting run off the Orlando Arena
floor Friday night, Jeff Van Gundy called a timeout in the opening
moments of the fourth quarter. Disgusted, he scolded the Knicks as
if they were misbehaving school children.
</P>
<P>
   Amid great expectations in their season opener, this new class
was that bad.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing all their old liabilities to bear _ hot heads, cold
shooting hands and a sloppy offense _ the Knicks fell apart in the
second half and were blown out by the Magic, 93-85.
</P>
<P>
   Down by 21 points midway through the fourth period, they gnawed
and clawed to get within 9 points in the final minutes. Latrell
Sprewell's 3-pointer with 2 minutes, 52 seconds remaining and
Charlie Ward's layup moments later capped an 11-0 run and brought
New York to within 82-75.
</P>
<P>
   But the game of catch-up was too huge after the Knicks had dug
themselves a huge hole in third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Some debut. Sprewell finished with 18 points on 8-of-16
shooting, and Patrick Ewing ended with 15 points on 7-for-13
shooting. But Allan Houston's misfires hurt. He hit only 5 of 17
shots, and, like the Knicks, looked out of rhythm each time he rose
and released the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Anderson finished with 19 points for Orlando, which simply
played smarter and stronger than the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Bo Outlaw made the defining play of the night, sending a lean-in
Sprewell shot with fewer than 9 minutes remaining straight to the
floor. The block sent the crowd into a tizzy. It had booed Sprewell
from the start of the game, and felt a great satisfaction to see
perhaps the league's most unpopular player rejected. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks fell apart at the end of the third quarter, scoring
just 3 points in five minutes and looking completely out of sync.
They were down by 14 points heading into the final period.
</P>
<P>
   Horace Grant gave Orlando a 68-58 lead with 1:17 remaining in
the period, and then one of the Knicks' old liabilities came back
to haunt them: their point guard lost his head.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Childs gave the rookie Matt Harpring a shove into the
backboard support after Grant's basket, a heated moment that cost
him a technical foul and the Knicks another point. Then Sprewell
missed two free throws and it just kept getting worse for the
Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 6:13 of the quarter, the Knicks were 1 for 7 from
the floor, 1 for 5 from the line and had 3 turnovers in 11
possessions.
</P>
<P>
   At times, there were flashes of greatness, like Ward finding
Houston gliding to the basket in midair for a layup in the first
half, or the way the Knicks whipped the ball around the perimeter
looking for the open man in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell threw down his first dunk as a Knick with 11:18 left in
the third quarter, a vicious two-handed breakaway jam that left him
sneering with delight. It seemed to be his way of telling the
Orlando crowd to get off his back.
</P>
<P>
   On the night he officially returned to the NBA _ 14 months after
choking P. J. Carlesimo and establishing himself as the league's
primary headache _ Sprewell was booed lustily.
</P>
<P>
   During player introductions. When he went to the free-throw
line. And almost every time he checked out of the game and returned
to the bench. One young fan held up a sign that read, ``Choke,
Spree.''
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to fit into a new offense and blend in with
Ewing and Houston. It is completely another to absorb the wrath of
almost every NBA road fan in America.
</P>
<P>
   If the Pat Riley-coached Knicks were reviled for most of the
1990s as hooligans in gym shorts, Sprewell's arrival begins a new
villainous chapter for the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only took seven minutes into the third quarter of a
preseason game for them to embrace him in New York,'' said Knicks
Coach Jeff Van Gundy, alluding to the standing ovation Sprewell
received in a preseason game. ``Road fans? I don't know if road
fans will ever warm up to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell's first day back on the road in the NBA began
encouragingly. He took extra shots after the morning shootaround at
the Orlando Arena, answered a few questions as he walked back to
the team hotel and, once there, was greeted by a few more fans
welcoming him back to the league.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived at the arena more than two hours before the game, and
began working on his 3-point shot. Knicks fans who had filed into
the arena early shouted words of encouragement to him.
</P>
<P>
   The onslaught began soon after. He knew it was coming. Yet
still, the reaction seemed to make him apprehensive in the game's
first few minutes. Horace Grant went over Sprewell's back and
tipped in two rebounds, he missed his first shot and checked out of
the game to a chorus of jeers with 5:58 left in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Friday morning what he expected, he said, ``A lot of
booing. A lot of heckling.''
</P>
<P>
   He had not played in a game since Nov. 29, 1997, two days before
the practice in which he attacked and threatened to kill Carlesimo
during a wild altercation. Suspended for a year by Commissioner
David Stern, he had his contract terminated by the Golden State
Warriors
</P>
<P>
   Though the arbitrator John Feerick sharply reduced the penalty,
Sprewell ended up missing 68 games that cost him $6.4 million in
salary _ the longest and costliest non-drug related suspension in
league history.
</P>
<P>
   He returned Friday night to an unfriendly crowd that scrutinized
his every move and waited anxiously for him to play poorly.
</P>
<P>
   As a team, the Knicks gave Magic fans their wish in the first 24
minutes. About the only thing the Knicks could be encouraged about
after the first half was that their three best players _ Houston,
Ewing and Sprewell _ had not played well together. And yet, they
were only trailing by 46-44. Ward had four turnovers early on. He
made some poor decisions by penetrating too far under the basket as
the defense collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson and the free-agent acquisition Kurt Thomas
compensated for everyone else's deficiencies. They combined to grab
10 rebounds and score 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   Until that awful third quarter, the Knicks had a shot. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, IOWA _ The drug czar, Barry McCaffrey, is
unequivocal: ``The worst drug ever to hit America is
methamphetamine.''
</P>
<P>
   He may well be right. Methamphetamine _ meth, speed, ice, glass,
crank, poor man's cocaine _ is a powerful stimulant that affects
the body in much the same way as cocaine. But it is cheaper than
coke, produces a longer high, and is spreading like wildfire.
</P>
<P>
   Although total drug abuse in America has fallen steadily since
the mid-1980s, and cocaine's share is down 75 percent from its peak
in 1985, the number of methamphetamine overdoses and deaths in the
United States tripled between 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken hold especially in rural areas where other drugs
are less widely available and ``cookers'' can manufacture the stuff
in clandestine laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   When Vice-President Al Gore visited Iowa in January, he spoke
about three issues: pigs, Social Security and methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this stuff so nasty? To begin with, a $50 investment
at the supermarket can produce $3,000-worth of methamphetamine. The
active ingredient is either ephedrine or pseudoephedrine, both of
which are found in over-the-counter cold medicines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cookers'' use products such as drain cleaners, lithium
batteries and engine-starter fluid to transform one of the chemical
precursors into a powder that can be smoked, snorted, injected or
drunk with a soda.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe is on the Internet. The Iowa Division of Narcotics
Enforcement busted 320 meth labs in 1998, up from 63 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Meth metabolizes slowly, and can stay active in the body for up
to 12 hours. The result is a prolonged burst of energy and
strength.
</P>
<P>
   Many Midwestern abusers are workers trying to get through a
double shift at the meat-packing plant or a long haul in the truck.
</P>
<P>
   High-school students are a growing market: the girls try meth to
lose weight, the boys to enhance their athletic and sexual prowess.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking meth may be cheap and easy, but there is nothing safe
about it. A quart of ether (drained from cans of starter fluid) can
explode with the force of five sticks of dynamite.
</P>
<P>
   According to McCaffrey, one in six meth labs explodes or burns
up each year. Those that do not combust are just as dangerous.
Every pound of methamphetamine leaves behind five to six pounds of
toxic waste.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa law-enforcement officials spend roughly $5,000 cleaning up
every lab they close down.
</P>
<P>
   Meth addicts become paranoid, delusional and violent. Cookers
tend to be heavily armed; their laboratories are sometimes
booby-trapped.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study in Iowa found that methamphetamine is a
contributing factor in 80 percent of all domestic violence cases.
Hospital emergency rooms must deal with overdoses in which the
abuser stays psychotic for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the boom in home brewing, Iowa officials estimate that
80 percent of the methamphetamine sold in the state is still being
smuggled in from Mexico or the Southwest, where it is manufactured
in giant ``superlabs.''
</P>
<P>
   This trade used to be run by motorcycle gangs, but in the late
1980s Mexican drug rings began moving much larger quantities of
meth along existing drug routes.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to stop it, state and federal authorities have
increased the penalties for making, using and selling
methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   Shopkeepers help by limiting sales of cold-medicine or tipping
off the authorities when customers make suspicious purchases. One
``cooker'' was busted in Des Moines after he bought $500-worth of
lithium batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa is running television commercials warning against the false
allure of methamphetamine. ``We can't arrest our way out of the
problem,'' says one top drug-enforcement official. The best way is
still to stop people before they start.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most worrying part is not where methamphetamine has
got to in America, but where it can still go.
</P>
<P>
   Outside California, America's big cities have been largely
unaffected. In 1998, the Drug Enforcement Administration's office
in Springfield, Ill., made nearly ten times as many amphetamine
arrests as the Chicago office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised it hasn't come yet,'' says Joseph Vanacora, the
agent in charge of the Chicago office. It probably will, and the
result could be devastating. &QL;

   HOLLYWOOD AND HOMESTEAD, FLA. _ Cutting through the condominium
complexes and strip malls that dominate the landscape north of
Miami, hundreds of miles of canals make their way to the Atlantic.
Once there, they disgorge into the ocean 1.7 billion gallons (6.4
billion liters) of fresh water a day.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred miles to the south, the parched Everglades National
Park struggles to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Water levels in the park are half what they were 50 years ago.
As if coming from a cheap tap, the water flow in south Florida is
never right.
</P>
<P>
   Long before New Yorkers discovered Florida, the south of the
state was a marshy haven for alligators and exotic birds. Each year
the summer rains that flooded Lake Okeechobee created natural
rivers running southward, ensuring a steady flow of fresh water for
the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   As Florida's population expanded, however, developers and
farmers saw little profit in swamps. They began pushing for an
intricate system of drainage canals leading to the ocean to dry out
the land, protect it against future flooding and provide drinking
water for new residents.
</P>
<P>
   The Army Corps of Engineers undertook such a project in 1947,
and south Florida's population and land prices have been rising
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, like a tourniquet, the new water-control system shut off
the natural flow of fresh water to the Everglades, and development
has since cut the region almost in half.
</P>
<P>
   A series of dykes now regulate the amount of water that enters
the Everglades National Park, drying up large tracts of marshland.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the water that does run into the park is contaminated by
chemicals sent downstream from farms; park officials estimate that
there has been a 93 percent decline in the bird population since
the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the water-management system has signally
failed to keep pace with south Florida's growth. Created to provide
drinking water for 2 million people, it must now must serve 6
million, with as many as 15 million expected by 2050.
</P>
<P>
   As if to redress its mistakes, the Army Corps of Engineers is
now back in the picture. A 20-year, $7.8 billion plan (the largest
environmental restoration proposal in American history), introduced
by Vice-President Al Gore last October, proposes that the engineers
should destroy several of the dykes that keep water from reaching
the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, thousands of acres of land in the region would be
bought by the government to act as reservoirs for the increased
water flow.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also calls for drilling hundreds of wells 1,000 feet
deep to store excess rainwater for the dry months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   To appease the state's powerful agricultural interests,
extensive flood-control measures are proposed to ensure that the
redirected water does not spill over on to farmland.
</P>
<P>
   The plan (to be paid for with both state and federal money) will
not be voted on by Congress until July. It must first withstand all
kinds of challenges.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club, an environmental group, objects to the proposed
use of underground storage wells, arguing that by building a
drinking water infrastructure to accommodate 15 million people
Florida is only encouraging further urban sprawl during the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the group advocates increasing the amount of land to be
bought for reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Florida's powerful
construction-and-land-development lobby argues that the proposed
land purchase is too large, and that the cost of the project will
require an exorbitant increase in property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Another blow to the proposal came in a recent letter to the
secretary of the interior, Bruce Babbitt. The letter, signed by six
eminent ecologists, argued that there were ``deep, systematic
problems'' with the plan, and that it needed further review by an
independent group of scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush, Florida's new governor, used to be a land developer,
and environmentalists were doubtful of his support. Yet Bush has
pledged that he will endorse the Everglades work so long as it is
based on sound science and fiscal accountability; he recently
appointed an ``Everglades czar'' in his administration.
</P>
<P>
   All sides agree that the state's water-management system has to
be changed, the sooner the better. But, with Florida's demographics
and ecosystems continually subject to change, water management _ as
one Miami lawyer explains it _ is much like Rubik's cube: solve one
bit of the puzzle, and you create several more. &QL;

<P>
   Relations between doctors and their largest professional
organization, the American Medical Association (AMA), have long
been poor. The sacking of George Lundberg, the editor of the
association's journal, for running a survey of student attitudes to
oral sex was merely the latest affront.
</P>
<P>
   True, the study was apparently influenced more by politics than
by medicine; but the largely conservative AMA, not wanting to
offend its friends in Congress, took it out on the freewheeling Dr.
Lundberg. So much for editorial independence.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, the association counted over two-thirds of
American doctors on its rolls; now it embraces barely 37 percent of
the country's 620,000 practicing doctors, most of them white and
male. (Its transatlantic counterpart, the British Medical
Association, includes over 80 percent of Britain's doctors.)
</P>
<P>
   Other groups have sprung up to represent the diverse interests
of America's specialist doctors, its general practitioners and its
growing population of female, black and Latino doctors.
</P>
<P>
   But none has the AMA's vast lobbying machinery, which, as Robert
Blendon, a health-care policy expert at Harvard, points out, makes
it harder for other doctors to make their views known.
</P>
<P>
   And they feel they have plenty to complain about: not least, the
changes that managed care has brought to American medical practice.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, managed-care companies think there are too many
doctors. America has 280 doctors per 100,000 people, two-thirds
more than Britain. Over 60 percent of them are medical or surgical
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 study by the Harvard School of Public Health found that
almost three-quarters of managed-care companies complained of too
many specialists and surgeons, and official projections suggest
that, to cut costs, their ranks be culled by two-fifths in the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Where doctors are not culled, health maintenance organizations
(HMOs) are trying to control their work.
</P>
<P>
   They have introduced a variety of measures: regular performance
reviews; guidelines for standard practice; money incentives to
reduce ``unnecessary'' procedures; mandatory authorization before
patients are sent on to further treatment; and swift ending of
contracts if doctors fail to live up to the mark.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, doctors dislike this close accounting, saying
that it lowers the quality of their work.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 survey by the Commonwealth Fund and Louis Harris and
Associates found that roughly 40 percent of doctors complained they
had less control in medical decision-making and less time to spend
with patients than three years earlier, in part because of the
administrative load.
</P>
<P>
   Only a quarter were fully satisfied with practicing medicine, a
disturbing statistic for patients.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some American doctors actually envy their colleagues in
Britain who, although enrolled in the National Health Service, are
not (yet) micro-managed to anything like the same degree.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors also complain that their wallets are stretched. It is
hard to shed tears, when their average annual income has increased
by roughly 5 percent a year to $166,000 today; but, according to
Wendy Everett of the Institute for the Future, a health-care
consultancy in Menlo Park, Calif., some specialists have seen their
earnings more than halved over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Although general practitioners are in shorter supply than
specialists, and more keenly sought by HMOs, they too are trying to
shy away from managed care.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jose Escarce of RAND in Santa Monica, cities with
plenty of HMO coverage are half as likely to attract new doctors
into practice as areas, such as parts of the Midwest, that remain
relatively HMO-free.
</P>
<P>
   But America's doctors can run only so far: over 90 percent of
them have some dealings with managed-care companies, since over
two-thirds of their patients are enrolled in them. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 600. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Medicine is a complex business in America, and doctors are not
the only, or indeed the most important, players. Once medical
professionals directed health-care policy; now there are employers,
managers, money men and increasingly vocal patients.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Schroeder, president of the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation in Princeton, N.J., reckons that doctors have lost their
central role in the health-care debate largely because they spent
their time on the wrong issue.
</P>
<P>
   Since Medicare was introduced in the 1960s, the AMA and its
doctors have been fighting government involvement in medical
practice for fear it would undermine their autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   What they did not appreciate until recently, Dr. Schroeder says,
is that corporate managed care would prove far more effective at
putting them in their place.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, doctors are trying to adapt. Although two-thirds of
them still work alone or with a single partner, Arnold Relman,
former editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, predicts that
American doctors will increasingly gather into large group
practices and integrated medical centers like the Mayo Clinic,
where they can pool their resources more effectively to fight the
HMOs and run their own affairs.
</P>
<P>
   And it seems that new graduates, trained in the shadow of modern
managed care, are better equipped to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly medicine remains a popular profession in America:
there are almost three applicants for every medical-school place,
up by two-thirds from a decade ago. And, since in the end almost
everybody needs them, doctors have a special hold over people.
</P>
<P>
   One prominent health-care consultant has lamented that doctors
are the biggest single obstacle to reforming American medicine. But
he prefers not to be named, for fear of offending his doctor. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Relations between doctors and their largest professional
organization, the American Medical Association (AMA), have long
been poor. The sacking of George Lundberg, the editor of the
association's journal, for running a survey of student attitudes to
oral sex was merely the latest affront.
</P>
<P>
   True, the study was apparently influenced more by politics than
by medicine; but the largely conservative AMA, not wanting to
offend its friends in Congress, took it out on the freewheeling Dr.
Lundberg. So much for editorial independence.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, the association counted over two-thirds of
American doctors on its rolls; now it embraces barely 37 percent of
the country's 620,000 practicing doctors, most of them white and
male. (Its transatlantic counterpart, the British Medical
Association, includes over 80 percent of Britain's doctors.)
</P>
<P>
   Other groups have sprung up to represent the diverse interests
of America's specialist doctors, its general practitioners and its
growing population of female, black and Latino doctors.
</P>
<P>
   But none has the AMA's vast lobbying machinery, which, as Robert
Blendon, a health-care policy expert at Harvard, points out, makes
it harder for other doctors to make their views known.
</P>
<P>
   And they feel they have plenty to complain about: not least, the
changes that managed care has brought to American medical practice.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, managed-care companies think there are too many
doctors. America has 280 doctors per 100,000 people, two-thirds
more than Britain. Over 60 percent of them are medical or surgical
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 study by the Harvard School of Public Health found that
almost three-quarters of managed-care companies complained of too
many specialists and surgeons, and official projections suggest
that, to cut costs, their ranks be culled by two-fifths in the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Where doctors are not culled, health maintenance organizations
(HMOs) are trying to control their work.
</P>
<P>
   They have introduced a variety of measures: regular performance
reviews; guidelines for standard practice; money incentives to
reduce ``unnecessary'' procedures; mandatory authorization before
patients are sent on to further treatment; and swift ending of
contracts if doctors fail to live up to the mark.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, doctors dislike this close accounting, saying
that it lowers the quality of their work.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 survey by the Commonwealth Fund and Louis Harris and
Associates found that roughly 40 percent of doctors complained they
had less control in medical decision-making and less time to spend
with patients than three years earlier, in part because of the
administrative load.
</P>
<P>
   Only a quarter were fully satisfied with practicing medicine, a
disturbing statistic for patients.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some American doctors actually envy their colleagues in
Britain who, although enrolled in the National Health Service, are
not (yet) micro-managed to anything like the same degree.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors also complain that their wallets are stretched. It is
hard to shed tears, when their average annual income has increased
by roughly 5 percent a year to $166,000 today; but, according to
Wendy Everett of the Institute for the Future, a health-care
consultancy in Menlo Park, Calif., some specialists have seen their
earnings more than halved over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Although general practitioners are in shorter supply than
specialists, and more keenly sought by HMOs, they too are trying to
shy away from managed care.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jose Escarce of RAND in Santa Monica, cities with
plenty of HMO coverage are half as likely to attract new doctors
into practice as areas, such as parts of the Midwest, that remain
relatively HMO-free.
</P>
<P>
   But America's doctors can run only so far: over 90 percent of
them have some dealings with managed-care companies, since over
two-thirds of their patients are enrolled in them. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 600. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Medicine is a complex business in America, and doctors are not
the only, or indeed the most important, players. Once medical
professionals directed health-care policy; now there are employers,
managers, money men and increasingly vocal patients.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Schroeder, president of the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation in Princeton, N.J., reckons that doctors have lost their
central role in the health-care debate largely because they spent
their time on the wrong issue.
</P>
<P>
   Since Medicare was introduced in the 1960s, the AMA and its
doctors have been fighting government involvement in medical
practice for fear it would undermine their autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   What they did not appreciate until recently, Dr. Schroeder says,
is that corporate managed care would prove far more effective at
putting them in their place.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, doctors are trying to adapt. Although two-thirds of
them still work alone or with a single partner, Arnold Relman,
former editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, predicts that
American doctors will increasingly gather into large group
practices and integrated medical centers like the Mayo Clinic,
where they can pool their resources more effectively to fight the
HMOs and run their own affairs.
</P>
<P>
   And it seems that new graduates, trained in the shadow of modern
managed care, are better equipped to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly medicine remains a popular profession in America:
there are almost three applicants for every medical-school place,
up by two-thirds from a decade ago. And, since in the end almost
everybody needs them, doctors have a special hold over people.
</P>
<P>
   One prominent health-care consultant has lamented that doctors
are the biggest single obstacle to reforming American medicine. But
he prefers not to be named, for fear of offending his doctor. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK AND TOKYO _ How fortunes change. A decade ago the
takeover of Firestone by Bridgestone, an ambitious Japanese
imitator, seemed to symbolize the decline of America's
manufacturing industry. Today it is the Japanese who seem
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Although the deal announced on Feb. 3 between America's Goodyear
and Japan's Sumitomo Rubber Industries was tactfully described as
an ``alliance,'' nobody is in any doubt over who will be in charge
_ or that other tire mergers are now likely.
</P>
<P>
   Before the deal, Bridgestone, Goodyear and France's Michelin
dominated the industry, with more than half of a world market now
worth an estimated $75 billion.
</P>
<P>
   This merger will reshuffle the rankings, catapulting Goodyear
into the number-one spot, with $15.1 billion in sales and 22.6
percent of the global market.
</P>
<P>
   Sumitomo will receive a shade over YEN 100 billion ($930
million) from Goodyear in exchange for handing over control of its
operations in America, Britain, Germany and France.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest, in Western Europe, will have sales of $4 billion,
almost a third of Goodyear's $13 billion total revenues last year.
Sumitomo will be left with its home market and a business that
makes golf balls.
</P>
<P>
   But Sumitomo was hardly negotiating from strength. Japan's
second-largest tire maker is only a quarter the size of its
arch-rival, Bridgestone, which sold YEN 2.35 trillion-worth of
tires and industrial products around the world in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, Bridgestone has overhauled its pension
scheme (a nightmare for most Japanese companies), written off the
goodwill associated with buying Firestone, replaced equipment and
rationalized its American operations.
</P>
<P>
   Sumitomo, on the other hand, has struggled. Without
Bridgestone's scale, it has had to rely on its depressed domestic
market. Its operating margin for the year to December 1998 was 3.3
percent, compared with Bridgestone's 9.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that the largest tire makers have found life
much easier. In a separate announcement this week, Goodyear
reported falling annual sales last year and announced 2,800 layoffs
as part of a cost-cutting program.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Colas, an analyst at CSFB, reckons that the industry has at
least 15 percent overcapacity. As car makers are squeezing
suppliers on costs, they are expecting better and safer tires.
</P>
<P>
   They are also thwarting tire makers' attempts to reduce the
range of tires on offer, a measure designed to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   Sumitomo, for instance, had been hoping to slim its range by
almost half to 3,000 in the next two years. But, as car makers
themselves are trying to save money by using fewer platforms, they
want to have more varieties of tire to help differentiate their
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear is forecasting $300 million-360 million in cost savings
in three years from this week's deal, a relatively easy target.
There are bound to be further job cuts among the new group's
109,000 employees. There will also be savings from purchasing
efficiencies _ raw materials represent half of the industry's
costs.
</P>
<P>
   And in Europe, the combination of Goodyear and Sumitomo, with
its powerful, but neglected, Dunlop brand, could mount a serious
challenge to Michelin.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the feeling that this deal will lead to others. In Japan,
Michelin has been sniffing around Yokohama Rubber, the
third-largest tire maker, with consolidated sales last year of YEN
415 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Sumitomo, which was linked with Goodyear even before its
recent deal, Yokohama fancies itself as the Pirelli of Asia _ a
go-it-alone maker of high-performance tires, much like the Italian
company.
</P>
<P>
   But such a strategy no longer makes sense, says Kunihiko
Shiohara of ING Barings. Sumitomo's sellout means that Yokohama is
now, in effect, on the block.
</P>
<P>
   In other markets there are regulatory worries. A merger between
Germany's Continental and Michelin would be ``an antitrust
nightmare,'' says Colas.
</P>
<P>
   Pirelli would fit with Goodyear, but their 90 percent or so
share of the Brazilian market would complicate a linkup. So
Bridgestone might pounce on Pirelli, even though it would do better
to buy a low-cost tire maker in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Tire makers everywhere will be looking anxiously over their
shoulders. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Mavericks blew a great chance to get the season
off to a great start last night.
</P>
<P>
   With two opportunities to defeat Seattle in regulation, the
Mavericks missed both chances and wound up dropping a 92-86
decision to the SuperSonics in overtime at KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle outscored Dallas, 8-2 in overtime, as the season finally
got started after a 191-day old lockout.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks will complete a two-game road trip tomorrow night
in Oakland against the Golden State Warriors. The Mavericks' home
opener is scheduled for Tuesday against the Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Steve Nash could have won the game for Dallas in
regulation, but he missed a 20-foot jumper with six seconds left.
A.C. Green rebounded with 4.9 seconds left, and the Mavs called
timeout to work for the possible winning basket.
</P>
<P>
   Cedric Ceballos got the ball on the play after the timeout, but
lost it on a drive to the basket, and the game went into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Sonics guard Gary Payton took over from there, scoring the first
six points of the extra session as Seattle opened the era of new
coach Paul Westphal on a winning note.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks won their second game of the season here last
season, and seem to always play well in this building. But this
time they couldn't close the deal when they were sitting right in
the cat bird's seat.
</P>
<P>
   With four new players on their roster, the Mavericks were
looking to see where they stood against one of the conference's
elite teams. What they found is that they're not far from being
where they want to be.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavs stayed close most of the game, and led by eight points
early in the second period. But costly turnovers, combined with
failing to prevent the Sonics from getting second shots, wound up
costing the Mavs.
</P>
<P>
   Green tied the game at 84-84 when he took a feed from Nash and
drilled an 18-footer from the left side. Then came those frantic
two shots in the waning seconds that couldn't find the mark.
</P>
<P>
   Green scored four points and grabbed six rebounds as the Mavs
shot .579 from the field and led after the first period, 27-21
</P>
<P>
   The Mavs padded the lead to as much as eight points early in the
second period. But the Sonics took a 46-42 lead at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Payton scored 10 of his points in the first half, and center
Olden Polynice had nine points and seven rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Mavs coach Don Nelson used his bench judiciously, playing 13
players in the first half. All scored except Hubert Davis and Chris
Anstey.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Dirk Nowitzki was starting his first pro game, and it was
obvious he had butterflies. Nowitzki missed all three of his shots
in the first half and was scoreless at intermission, including two
long-range shots that went over the backboard.
</P>
<P>
   Nowitzki wound up with two points _ both on free throws _ and
was 0-of-5 from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   A jumper by Vin Baker pushed the Sonics ahead 52-46 three
minutes into the third quarter. But a running jumper by Ceballos,
who scored a team-high 16 points, and an offensive rebound by Gary
Trent off a missed free throw bolted the Mavs ahead, 67-64, going
into the final period.
</P>
<P>
   Nash, who had nine points, buried a 3-point field goal as the
Mavs closed to within 78-77 with 5:02 left.
</P>
<P>
   Erick Strickland had 10 points and Michael Finley added 9 points
for the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mavs are kicking themselves for blowing two chances down
the stretch, when they could have won the game before it went into
overtime. /

TRUTH REVEALED ...WELL, SOME OF IT, BY `X' STANDARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone else out there get the feeling that, soon after the
season opener, ``The X-Files'' crossed the center line and drove
off the cliff in pursuit of Thelma and Louise?
</P>
<P>
   If so, I have good news. ``The X-Files'' that you know and love
_ the one about Fox Mulder's quest to expose the conspiracy between
the shadowy Syndicate and the alien invaders _ is back, at least
for the next two episodes. And just in time. Another goofball
stand-alone episode like the Christmas one with Ed Asner and Lily
Tomlin as holey ghosts might have made me an ex-phile. Even the
``Dreamland'' two-parter, in which Mulder (David Duchovny) assumed
another man's identity, drove me to paying bills and doing the
laundry. On a critic's scale of disapproval, you can't sink much
lower without striking oil.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, viewers will find out in the February-sweeps
two-parter airing Sunday and Feb. 14 that the black oil that wreaks
havoc on the human condition is called ``purity,'' and it's the
lifeblood of the alien invaders.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the mischievous style of Chris Carter, the
self-described paranoiac responsible for ``The X-Files.'' It is
also like Carter to open up a new can of worms as he puts the old
ones on the compost pile.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a lot of stuff explained,'' Carter
promised, ``... (but) that doesn't necessarily mean everything's
wrapped up and finished. In fact, there's a lot to do.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough. We'll learn a great deal about the conspiracy and
the Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis) in these two episodes,
both written by Carter and Frank Spotnitz. But there's plenty of
truth still out there (see box).
</P>
<P>
   Carter assumes the series will run at least one more season _
its seventh _ and then he wants to build on the movie franchise
begun last summer. (He thinks the next film could be out in 2001.)
</P>
<P>
   ``An eighth season could happen,'' he said, ``but the plans are
to culminate at the end of season seven. I don't think you
necessarily have to have a movie in the theaters right after that.
Maybe a year is a good amount of time before the next movie.''
</P>
<P>
   As to how it all ends, even Carter isn't entirely certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you try to define it too early and too well,'' he said,
``you lose some of the fun of discovering it along the way. I use
the Lewis and Clark analogy all the time: They knew which direction
they were headed, (but) didn't know what they were going to find.
That's kind of the way we've been proceeding.''

INS ERROR IN BOOKLET COULD STOP IMMIGRANTS FROM BECOMING CITIZENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new guide that the federal government intends as a primer for
immigrants contains an error that could keep some from becoming
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In late December, the Immigration and Naturalization Service
began distributing close to 700,000 copies of ``A Guide to
Naturalization'' across the nation. The new, 47-page booklet is
intended to replace a 9-year-old, lengthy volume with a new version
that gives standard, easy-to-understand information on becoming a
citizen.
</P>
<P>
   But the government couldn't keep its own rules straight. The
problems center on how the book explains Selective Service rules.
</P>
<P>
   Male aliens _ both legal and illegal _ have to register with the
Selective Service when they are at least 18 but not yet 26 years
old. Aliens who should have registered but didn't can be refused
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   The guide's glossary gives a summary of Selective Service rules
by stating that males must register if they are over 26 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, that statement in the guide is wrong, said
Henry Williams, general counsel of the Selective Service System.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration attorneys and others who work with people trying to
become citizens say the INS has become more strict recently about
enforcing Selective Service rules. Would-be citizens who think
they're following the rules might be inadvertently failing to
comply with them, and could even be denied citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to cause problems,'' said Paul Choquette, a Seattle
immigration attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants frequently run afoul of Selective Service
requirements, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants don't speak English and may not attend secondary
schools. ``No one ever tells them it's a rule,'' Choquette said.
</P>
<P>
   The INS acknowledges an error was made, but has no plans to
recall the guides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, it looks to be the case (that an error was
made),'' agreed Alison Morris, who is in charge of distribution of
the guide for the INS. She said Greg Gourley, who teaches
citizenship classes to immigrants in the Seattle area, alerted her
to the error two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   She noted, however, that the glossary also correctly says that
people must register who were permanent U.S. residents between the
ages of 18 and 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tells people both the right thing and the wrong thing in
the same paragraph. It is, I hate to say it, just a glossary,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst-case scenario is that somebody is going to be
confused, and then they'll call.''
</P>
<P>
   The glossary also contains a telephone number for the Selective
Service.
</P>
<P>
   The error will be corrected in the next printing, which should
take place in a month or so, Morris said. The computer version of
the guide on the INS web site will be corrected more quickly, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The guide was a year in development and cost close to $600,000
for the first printing.
</P>
<P>
   The INS is handing it to to groups that help immigrants and to
individual immigrants who pick up a citzenship application. The INS
says it created the guide to ``provide better and more consistent
information'' and that it expects applicants for citizenship to
read the publication.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said the hope also is that the guides will be recycled
among the immigrant community.
</P>
<P>
   The INS employee who was responsible for the Selective Service
language was not available Friday. But Williams, the Selective
Service general counsel, said he believes the INS did not consult
his agency about the language.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said the INS has tried recently to have a closer
relationship with the Selective Service, including having meetings
with representatives of the system and putting links on the INS web
site to Selective Service.
</P>
<P>
   The error in the glossary is serious enough that Courley, the
citizenship teacher, calls the guide dangerous for immigrants to
rely on. He said he worries that some immigrants may be denied
citizenship because they follow the erroneous information.
</P>
<P>
   The Selective Service's rules say people who don't register may
not be penalized if they can show their failure to sign up was
neither knowing nor willful. In addition to denying citizenship,
those who fail to register can be denied government jobs,
vocational training and student loans.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Seattle area, INS officials are requiring written
statements explaining why an immigrant didn't register, Gourley
said. Not so long ago, an oral statement sufficed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only recently have they taken it more seriously,'' Gourley
said. ``They are really crossing the T's and dotting the I's.''
</P>
<P>
   Choquette said in the last year he has noticed that INS
examiners typically bring up Selective Service registration. Some
even ``harp on it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Often, they tell applicants for citizenship to register even if
they are too old to do so, Choquette said.

MOM AND POP BUSINESSES CAN GET HELP FROM NEW ADVICE NETWORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Schell is no dummy when it comes to business, but he writes
for them.
</P>
<P>
   Schell, who is co-author with Eric Tyson of ``Small Business for
Dummies'' (IDG Books, 1998, $19.99), has street smarts when it
comes to running small businesses. He's started six of his own, and
all of them have been successful.
</P>
<P>
   He sold his last business, a sportswear company with $25 million
in sales and 200 employees, in 1990 because it got too big for his
taste. He likes the small part of small business, the upstart part
of running a start-up.
</P>
<P>
   And now he's trying to make sure others succeed in
small-business enterprises as well.
</P>
<P>
   Schell's latest venture is an operation he calls Opportunity
Knocks. Headquartered in Bend, Ore., it's a problem-solving
organization for small-business owners. He's hoping to export the
concept to other cities if he can find people to champion it the
way he has in Bend.
</P>
<P>
   Modeled after the successful TEC executive committees pioneered
by San Diego-based TEC Worldwide, Opportunity Knocks provides a way
for small businesses to come together and brainstorm solutions to
common problems.
</P>
<P>
   TEC runs groups for chief executive officers and presidents of
companies with more than $3 million in sales and 25 or more
employees. It also has an emerging entrepreneurs group for people
running businesses with $750,000 to $3 million in sales and five to
25 employees. The groups gather to give each other feedback and
help with problems.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunity Knocks is going after much smaller organizations,
Schell said. ``This is for mom-and-pops.''
</P>
<P>
   The groups serve as ad-hoc advisory teams for small-business
owners, he said. Each circle has about a dozen small-business
owners and one professional facilitator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trial and error is the No. 1 management tool for most
small-business owners,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't have to be. ``Someone is bound to have had the
problem before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bend, a relatively small community with 40,000 people, already
has 200 businesses organized into 16 different teams, he said. The
teams meet once a month. Participation costs $99 a year. Home
business owners are linked together, since their problems are
somewhat different than those operating outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, the 200 businesses employ about 4,500 people.
</P>
<P>
   Although they represent a wide variety of types of businesses,
the problems they face aren't that different, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overriding problem in small business is that nobody knows
how to get a product to market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing, which includes strategic product development,
pricing, advertising and distribution, is always a problem, whether
a company is making widgets or selling services.
</P>
<P>
   The second major problem facing almost all small businesses is
how to deal with employees.
</P>
<P>
   Making the transition from a lone eagle to a manager is
particularly troublesome for many entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell people employees are from Mars and owners are from
Venus,'' he said. What motivates owners isn't the same as what
motivates employees.
</P>
<P>
   Employees typically need appreciation, recognition, the ability
to feel part of a team and some degree of security, he said.
``Those are not the same things that motivate owners.''
</P>
<P>
   But when entrepreneurs get together, they can help each other
troubleshoot and identify their blind spots.
</P>
<P>
   That's critical because four out of five businesses don't see
their fifth birthday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one mistake small-business owners make,'' he
said. ``They will say, `I've got a cash-flow problem,' or, `I
didn't get enough money,' or `I've got the wrong location,''' he
said. ``But those are all symptoms. The reason they have them is
they rely on trial and error as a management tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Small-business owners are by definition independent, he said.
They're usually loathe to get someone else's advice.
</P>
<P>
   But the first thing they should do is put together a group of
advisers they trust, he said. In Opportunity Knocks, the owners
serve as each other's advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not networking,'' he said. ``It's problem-solving.''
</P>
<P>
   A board of advisers serves as a kind of collective mentor, he
said. Advisers can help steer a company away from a potential
disaster by sharing their experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take advantage of someone else's mistakes,'' he said. ``The
biggest mistake is going it alone.''

OPENING NIGHT ISN'T WORTH THE LONG WAIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ So there's your answer, loud and clear.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of educated guesses about what post-apocalypse pro
basketball would look and sound like, the Los Angeles Lakers and
Houston Rockets rang in the new year Friday night with a clank.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers won 99-91, and it wasn't quite pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Jones of the Lakers was way short on his first jump shot,
way long on his second, and nowhere close on his third, the thunks
enhanced by technology, the microphones bolted to the backboard and
wired to the PA system.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley of the Rockets went to the trouble of posting up
emergency Lakers starter Corey Blount only to get more backboard
than rim.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-three-year-old Scottie Pippen, nervous or just sloppy in
his Rockets debut, thought about schooling 20-year-old Laker Kobe
Bryant and wound up with a running jump shot blocked back in his
face.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams were shooting 40 percent at the half. Even in the
'90s, that's bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it'll still be watchable, decent basketball,'' Lakers
coach Del Harris had said before the game, not wanting to be
accused of overhyping the product. ``I don't think it'll be totally
sweeps (quality television).''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it didn't help the general quality that the Lakers
played without their scheduled starting forwards, Rick Fox (foot)
and Robert Horry (baby).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, maybe the messy parts would have been messy even if
this was game 33 of a normal season instead of game 1 of the
post-lockout season.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it also could get worse, after the enormity of the
50-games, 90-nights schedule sinks in, before marches like Denver's
eight games in 10 days and Minnesota's three West Coast trips in 16
days leave healthy young men feeling like Bob Dole on his last
ditch, 72-sleepless-hours campaign trek.
</P>
<P>
   The question then will be who's up to the unusual challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom cuts both ways, with either young teams like
the Lakers holding the edge on fitness or veteran teams like the
Rockets better off because they ``know how to take care of
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Do the old guys really have a secret?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Bryant, the Lakers' very young
guard/forward/tycoon, said, shrugging. ``I'm waiting to find that
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' inexperience has been a burden for two years but
could be a help this year, when they're not only young and
basically healthy but also deep, with the prospect of a nine- or
10-man rotation to keep legs fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Against arthritic teams like Houston and Utah, two of their
Western rivals, and Indiana, the Eastern power of the post-Jordan
age, maybe they'd be advised to turn up the tempo and try to tire
the old men out.
</P>
<P>
   Houston has six guys over 30, four over 33, including Pippen
(coming off back surgery), Barkley (bad back) and Hakeem Olajuwon
(bum knee). Utah has four over 34, including its big two. Indiana's
lineup averages 32.9 years of age.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have !ital!one!off! man, Derek Harper, older than 30,
and should be able to run all night.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, nothing will win back shaken fans like a good fast
break.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully (they'll run) not just (against) the veteran
teams,'' said Derek Fisher, who as the starting point guard
controls the ball and the tempo as much as anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like over the past couple of years we've cheated
ourselves a little bit by playing too conservatively. We've got
players who are more suited to running.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounds like a call to abandon the thus-far futile quest for
a mature half-court attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Bryant said, ``a team like Houston, those veteran guys,
they know how to conserve their bodies. They're not going to let
you run them off the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   A return to Showtime seems a remote possibility, and, in fact,
the Rockets outscored the Lakers in the first half 10-4 on
``fast-break points,'' according to the official scorer.
</P>
<P>
   Harris isn't exactly a running coach. And in the '97-98 season _
back when NBA seasons came with hyphens _ when Nick Van Exel was
sidelined the Lakers became more deliberate than usual. And now Van
Exel is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in here is the rationale for signing Dennis Rodman,
who would get the rebounds and turnovers off of which a fast break
feeds.
</P>
<P>
   Or somewhere in here is a plea for the Lakers to push the
fast-forward button on that offense.
</P>
<P>
   Based on first post-lockout impressions, watching them run would
be more fun than watching them shoot.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration wants to end limits on
how many planes can land in an hour at New York's Kennedy
International and La Guardia airports and Chicago's O'Hare,
according to people who have been briefed on the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The change would make it easier for start-up airlines to
challenge established carriers, at a time when transportation
officials have been taking steps to increase capacity and are
looking for other ways to promote airline competition.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of limits is not one of safety, Federal Aviation
Administration officials said. If planes are joining an approach
queue faster than they are landing, air traffic controllers simply
tell them to fly slower, or not to take off.
</P>
<P>
   But in establishing who can fly into the four airports, the
Transportation Department has handed a huge advantage to
``incumbent'' carriers, which were allotted most of the landing
``slots'' decades ago and have relinquished few of them. Slots are
now bought and sold for prices up to $3 million each, aviation
executives say.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department, in a request to Congress on
Monday, will ask for legislation phasing out the rule that limits
flights at the three airports, officials said. While the department
could act itself, congressional action provides political cover and
would be less subject to court challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Political brawls over similar proposals have broken out between
lawmakers barraged by noise complaints and others lobbying for more
air service. It is a particularly emotional, and local, issue.
</P>
<P>
   In his only major interview since becoming House speaker, Dennis
Hastert, whose Illinois district is near enough to O'Hare to
benefit from more service but far enough to escape most noise
problems, told The Chicago Sun-Times that he was open to adding
flights there.
</P>
<P>
   The rule limiting flights ``is a major impediment to better air
service for communities all over the country,'' said Jeffrey Shane,
an aviation lawyer who represents Access Air, a new carrier, based
in Omaha, Neb., that wants to fly its three Boeing 737s to La
Guardia. Access leases two slots from Northwest Airlines but fears
that Northwest will soon take them back for its own use.
</P>
<P>
   Others said the effect of a change would be hard to predict. At
the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Allen Morrison, a
spokesman, said that the limits have forced various airlines to be
turned away but that the agency did not know how many.
</P>
<P>
   At the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union's
executive vice president, James Randall Schwitz Jr., said, ``It's
basically going to have no effect on the system.''
</P>
<P>
   The airports are near saturation levels now, he said, and ``you
can only put a certain number of airplanes in a given amount of air
space at a certain time.''
</P>
<P>
   If more planes try to land and all are delayed as a result,
experts said, that would ripple through the system, as airplanes
land late, take off late for their next flights and continue to be
late all day, with passengers missing connections.
</P>
<P>
   But other aviation experts emphasized that the government was
bringing in new landing systems and other technology to increase
capacity, and that the limits on flights were too constricting.
</P>
<P>
   And Shane said that some airlines did not use all their slots
every day, or flew small planes just to maintain the slots and keep
others from getting them.
</P>
<P>
   How elimination of the rule would affect the balance and
competition among airlines is hard to predict, experts said. Samuel
Buttrick, an airline analyst at Paine Webber, said, ``Open access
to slot-controlled airports will offer entry to discount carriers,
but at the same time allow dominant carriers to expand.''
</P>
<P>
   If not for slot controls at O'Hare, Buttrick said, United
Airlines might have squeezed out the other hub carrier, American.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the congressional delegations from the New York
metropolitan region are expected to join House members from near
O'Hare, including Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., to fight the plan in the
House. Last year, a similar coalition succeeded in killing a bill
that would have allowed more departures and arrivals at the
restricted airports.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   New York City leaders were lining up to oppose the proposal.
``They are crazy,'' said Claire Shulman, the Queens borough
president. ``Maybe it would lower fares a little bit. But on
balance, this will be a disaster for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan is likely to win strong support from other regions,
where officials complain that high air fares are hurting the
economies of smaller cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think my colleagues downstate would want Syracuse,
Binghamton, Rochester and Buffalo to die because they couldn't
stand 10 more flights a day,'' said Rep. Louise Slaughter,
D-Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The policy, formally called the high-density rule, was
established 30 years ago but the numbers have been gradually
increased since then. The proposal to phase out the rule over five
years will be part of the administration's bill to reauthorize the
Federal Aviation Administration; the last reauthorization was for
just six months, in part because of a dispute over limits on
airport operations, and it expires on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   National Airport, across the Potomac River from Washington, is
the only other airport with such limitations; it would not be
affected by the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   At O'Hare, existing rules limit arrivals to 80 in any half-hour
and 155 an hour. At La Guardia, the limit is 68 an hour; at
Kennedy, the rules are in effect from 3 p.m. until 8 p.m., and the
hourly limits vary from 75 to 95. At all three airports, there are
subquotas for big airliners, commuter flights and general-aviation
planes.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Transportation Department refused to comment in
advance of the Monday announcement. But the transportation
secretary, Rodney Slater, said in a speech in New York on
Wednesday, ``In the past year, the high-density rule has come under
increasing scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be an issue on which all of us must engage in the
coming legislative year,'' he said in the speech, to the Wings
Club, an aviation group.

WASHINGTON STAFF HAD IMPROPER CONTACT WITH AN EIGHTH RECRUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The University of Washington acknowledged Friday that
five UW signees to football letters of intent were visited
improperly by Husky coaches, not four, and that coaches visited a
total of eight recruits Sunday outside NCAA regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In another twist to the UW's admitted violation of two NCAA
rules this week, the discrepancy came to light Friday when Oregon
coach Mike Bellotti alleged that the Huskies also talked Sunday to
defensive lineman Kevin Mack of Oxnard, Calif., a recruit who
signed with the Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, UW assistant coach Randy Hart acknowledged that the
conversation with Mack came in the home of Husky recruit Jerome
Stevens, a linebacker at Rio Mesa High in Oxnard and a close friend
of Mack.
</P>
<P>
   Until that disclosure, the Huskies had said four of their signed
recruits had been visited Sunday by their coaches. Washington had
not mentioned Stevens in its list of the four visited.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Daves, the UW sports information director, ascribed the
discrepancy to a mistake by Rick Neuheisel, the new head coach, who
in a press conference Wednesday had listed only four Husky recruits
as having been a part of the improper visits.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, UW compliance director Ralph Bayard said Friday there
were three other recruits contacted who didn't sign with the UW:
Mack; Adam Wade of Moreno Valley, Calif., who signed Friday with
Colorado State; and Daniel Waldrop, a lineman from Los Angeles who
wavered among Washington State, Colorado and Nebraska down the
stretch before choosing Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Daves said the confusion arose during Neuheisel's hurried
explanation Wednesday during what was originally scheduled to be a
briefing of the media on letters of intent signed that day.
</P>
<P>
   After Neuheisel arrived 50 minutes late for the meeting, he went
over recruiting in detail. He then spent seven minutes addressing
the NCAA violations before Daves indicated he needed to leave for a
player meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at one point how many of the signed Huskies had been
visited illegally Sunday, Neuheisel said, ``Five. No, wait a
minute.'' Then he read the names of John Anderson, Chris Massey,
Domynic Shaw and Clayton Hathorne, leaving out Jerome Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   Bayard said Friday he felt it was an oversight by Neuheisel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that five had signed with us in my own mind,'' Bayard
said.
</P>
<P>
   The improper visits are part of a two-pronged bugaboo this week
for Neuheisel, who admitted having made calls to enrolled Colorado
players in apparent violation of an NCAA rule. But he emphatically
denied trying to recruit those players, as CU has alleged, and no
player called by Neuheisel has pointed to that train of
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Bellotti, one of four coaches who has publicly taken the Huskies
to task for the visitation violation, said he was alerted by an
assistant coach to the Hart visit to the two recruits, Stevens and
Mack.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd been recruiting him (Mack) the whole time,'' Bellotti
said, referring to the recruiting season.
</P>
<P>
   Mack, indeed, apparently was impressionable. SuperPrep Magazine
said in mid-January he had committed to San Diego State and quoted
Mack as saying, ``I remain open, even though I am committed.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had requested that Mack come to Stevens' home, Hart
said, ``When I got there, they said, `Kevin's coming over.' I said,
`Great.' He said he wasn't going to change. He had already
committed to Oregon a week ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellotti maintains Oregon still had a shot at Massey before
Washington's visit to him Sunday, although Massey and his father
had indicated a lean toward Washington down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Bellotti said, referring to Oregon's chances at
Massey. ``My conversation with the dad on Monday led me to believe
that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Gueringer, who coached both Massey and Wade, said Friday,
``The Washington guy (defensive coordinator Tim Hundley) had no
influence on the decision those kids made. Chris was always a
Washington guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade, meanwhile, wanted to sign with Colorado State earlier this
week, but his father wouldn't validate his son's letter of intent,
preferring he go to Washington. Finally, the father relented and
Wade signed Friday with CSU.
</P>
<P>
   The twin flaps have made for a rocky welcome for Neuheisel,
whose arrival at Washington already had been greeted with some
controversy because of his $1-million-per-year contract, apparently
one of the five highest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel, who coached four years at Colorado, knew some
similarly tough times in Boulder despite a 33-14 record. In 1997,
the Buffaloes forfeited all their victories in a 5-6 season for the
use of an ineligible player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed that Neuheisel could have any staff members in
prospects' homes during the quiet period,'' said Wayne Drumm of
Anchorage, father of Colorado player Brandon Drumm. ``Even parents
of recruits know those rules. I can't see any way coaches wouldn't
know. It blows my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   As is routine in matters involving NCAA irregularities,
Washington declared ineligible the five who signed with the Huskies
and is expecting to see them reinstated soon.
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10 Conference will investigate the two violations and
decide in June whether to reprimand or penalize the Huskies.

LAKERS BEAT ROCKETS

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ When at last the extended offseason of woe
ended, and the NBA turned away from its labor war and the end of
the Michael Jordan era, it figured to be a while, perhaps years,
before the league's future would come into focus under a new star.
</P>
<P>
   But impatient Kobe Bryant didn't wait for his cue.
</P>
<P>
   As if the constellations had aligned in Bryant's favor, the Los
Angeles Lakers lost their two top small forwards to unusual
circumstances Friday, and Bryant stepped into the starting lineup _
for his first career opening-night start. Against the collection of
legends known as the Houston Rockets. Against Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   And Bryant being Bryant, he wasted no time asserting himself. He
scored seven points in the first quarter, outplayed Pippen the
entire game and finished with his first career double-double, 25
points and 10 rebounds, as the Lakers held off the Rockets 99-91 at
the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal started slowly but finished with a team-high 30
points and 14 rebounds. Charles Barkley had 31 points and 15
rebounds to lead Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant not only powered the Lakers offense, he shut down Pippen,
holding him to 10 points on 4-of-18 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad night for the Lakers' third option at small forward.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Del Harris intends to use Bryant off the bench again this
season, but he had no choice Friday. Starter Rick Fox is hampered
by sore ankles and knees and can't play again until his new
athletic insoles arrive, possibly not until Tuesday. Robert Horry,
Harris' next preferred option, was in Houston with his wife and
newborn son.
</P>
<P>
   But Harris wasn't worried about thrusting the 20-year-old Bryant
into the lineup, no matter the opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's experienced quite a lot already,'' Harris said before
tipoff. ``The guy's started the All-Star Game and played key roles
in playoff series.... I think he can handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   So well, in fact, that Bryant could make a case to play Lou
Gehrig to Fox's Wally Pip. Harris has said he didn't want to start
Bryant until he was ready to be the starter for the rest of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible,'' he said of leaving Bryant in the lineup
permanently. ``Normally we let (an injured starter) come back and
start at that position until they are knocked out of the position.
I assume that's what we'll do here as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, when Kobe Bryant obviously establishes himself as a
guy that you just can't keep out of the starting lineup, you put
him there, and he'll stay in there for the next 10 or 12 years.
That's what you would hope for, and that could happen at any
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it already has. Fox is likely to miss Sunday's game as
well, and Harris will have to decide whether to start Horry at
power forward, his usual spot, or small forward.
</P>
<P>
   If Bryant was nervous about starting opening night, he certainly
lied well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very calm,'' he said before the game. ``It's kind of
like a new feeling for me; usually in the past I've just been,
whew, rush of adrenaline, you know what I mean? I'm very, very
excited, but I learned very quickly about how to play the game
emotionally. I'm surprisingly calm. I didn't really expect to be
calm. Period, coming out for opening night, let alone starting.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing against Bulls alum Pippen, he of the six championship
rings, Bryant called it ``a chance to learn'' from Jordan's old
running mate. Turns out Bryant was the master this night.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Horry's wife Keva gave birth to their second child,
Robert Camron Horry, at 5 p.m. CST. He weighs 8 pounds, 11 ounces,
and both mother and baby were said to be doing fine.... Barkley was
wearing a pair of Air Jordans, with Michael's No. 23 imprinted on
the heels. ``Nike said they wanted other players to wear Michael's
shoes as a tribute to him,'' Barkley said, ``but I know better.
They just wanted the other guys to sell his shoes for him.''

   AMMAN _ It was always a balancing act. Jordan is a buffer state
between more powerful countries, notably Israel and Iraq. King
Hussein's political career was spent playing off his enemies
against each other.
</P>
<P>
   It was not easy. The king needed to keep in with the great
powers, but preserve his nationalist credentials.
</P>
<P>
   An early act of the young Harrow and Sandhurst-educated monarch
was to fire his British military adviser Glubb Pasha.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967 he joined Egypt and Syria to fight Israel only to lose
the West Bank. In 1991 he won overwhelming popular support from
Jordanians by maintaining a friendly neutrality towards Iraq during
the Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   But the king was also the man who crushed the Palestinians in
Jordan in a bloody civil war in 1970. Three years later he secretly
flew to Israel to tell a disbelieving Israeli prime minister that
Egypt and Syria were about to launch a war.
</P>
<P>
   He played both ends against the middle because he believed
Jordan's weakness _ 4.4 million people and no natural resources or
defenses _ left him no choice.
</P>
<P>
   The king also knew that foreign policy failure would have
immediate domestic consequences. More than half the population of
Jordan is Palestinian, largely excluded from power but dominating
private business. He needed an Israeli guarantee against Iraq, but
not at the price of permanently alienating the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   His death, considered all but inevitable, comes at a bad moment
for Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 the King signed a peace treaty with Israel. It has
produced no economic and few political dividends, though it got him
back into the good graces of the U.S. after the Gulf war. It is
unpopular among Jordanians and Palestinians alike. A year later he
broke with Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader.
</P>
<P>
   But peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians are
stalemated and Saddam Hussein has survived. Both have felt free to
send their assassination squads into the streets of Amman.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is pressuring Jordan to turn itself into a base for
action against Iraq, a policy wildly unpopular among ordinary
Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
   There is a much bigger question mark over the future of
Jordanian policy than expected a month ago. This is because of the
dismissal of Crown Prince Hassan, the king's brother and primary
lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   The new heir to the throne, the king's eldest son, Abdullah, is
an unknown quantity. The Washington Post says that his supporters
recently hired a former CIA section as ``public relations
consultant'' creating doubts about the judgement of the men around
him.
</P>
<P>
   One of Abdullah's strengths may be an ability to improve
relations with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, who never forgave
King Hussein for his stance in the Gulf war. The Jordanian embassy
in Kuwait is reopening and Gulf rulers are reported to have offered
financial support.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment Jordan is weaker, because part of its strength
was the political astuteness and prestige of King Hussein. It is
less capable of sustaining political shocks stemming from the
American and British confrontation with Iraq or the deteriorating
relations between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Its neighbor are waiting to see if the house King Hussein built
will hold together. &QL;

   AMMAN _ It was always a balancing act. Jordan is a buffer state
between more powerful countries, notably Israel and Iraq. King
Hussein's political career was spent playing off his enemies
against each other.
</P>
<P>
   It was not easy. The king needed to keep in with the great
powers, but preserve his nationalist credentials.
</P>
<P>
   An early act of the young Harrow and Sandhurst-educated monarch
was to fire his British military adviser Glubb Pasha.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967 he joined Egypt and Syria to fight Israel only to lose
the West Bank. In 1991 he won overwhelming popular support from
Jordanians by maintaining a friendly neutrality towards Iraq during
the Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   But the king was also the man who crushed the Palestinians in
Jordan in a bloody civil war in 1970. Three years later he secretly
flew to Israel to tell a disbelieving Israeli prime minister that
Egypt and Syria were about to launch a war.
</P>
<P>
   He played both ends against the middle because he believed
Jordan's weakness _ 4.4 million people and no natural resources or
defenses _ left him no choice.
</P>
<P>
   The king also knew that foreign policy failure would have
immediate domestic consequences. More than half the population of
Jordan is Palestinian, largely excluded from power but dominating
private business. He needed an Israeli guarantee against Iraq, but
not at the price of permanently alienating the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   His death, considered all but inevitable, comes at a bad moment
for Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 the King signed a peace treaty with Israel. It has
produced no economic and few political dividends, though it got him
back into the good graces of the U.S. after the Gulf war. It is
unpopular among Jordanians and Palestinians alike. A year later he
broke with Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader.
</P>
<P>
   But peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians are
stalemated and Saddam Hussein has survived. Both have felt free to
send their assassination squads into the streets of Amman.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is pressuring Jordan to turn itself into a base for
action against Iraq, a policy wildly unpopular among ordinary
Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
   There is a much bigger question mark over the future of
Jordanian policy than expected a month ago. This is because of the
dismissal of Crown Prince Hassan, the king's brother and primary
lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   The new heir to the throne, the king's eldest son, Abdullah, is
an unknown quantity. The Washington Post says that his supporters
recently hired a former CIA section as ``public relations
consultant'' creating doubts about the judgement of the men around
him.
</P>
<P>
   One of Abdullah's strengths may be an ability to improve
relations with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, who never forgave
King Hussein for his stance in the Gulf war. The Jordanian embassy
in Kuwait is reopening and Gulf rulers are reported to have offered
financial support.
</P>

   For the moment Jordan is weaker, because part of its strength

American and British confrontation with Iraq or the deteriorating
relations between Israel and the Palestinians.

   What king would ever turn up at his own state security jail to

   Leith Shubailath had infuriated the monarch _ he was a man

Yitzhak Rabin's funeral. When the king arrived at the prison,
Shubeilath delayed him ten minutes while he said goodbye to his
fellow inmates. Hussein waited patiently for him.
</P>
<P>
   Would Saddam (who prefers to string his prisoners up) have done

   Perhaps it is this which distinguished the king: among the

   When King Hussein began his initial six months of cancer
treatment at the Mayo Clinic last year, his younger brother Hassan
should have cast his mind back to the day, 43 years earlier, when
another trusted servant of the monarchy believed he was secure in
his job.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein was only 21 but had already argued brusquely with
Lieutenant General Sir John Bagot Glubb, commander of his Arab
Legion and principal military adviser to his majesty.
</P>
<P>
   Persuaded by his own confidants that Glubb Pasha should be
dismissed, and convinced that the British were trying to control
Jordan's armed forces, the king fired the 59-year old British
general. Glubb Pasha was taken to the airport the next morning in
Hussein's own car.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring this historical precedent, Crown Prince Hassan used his
regency last year to boost his own image, to project his rule in
the Jordanian press and to demand the firing of Hussein's chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   To the sick king in Minnesota, his brother Hassan was trying to
take over the army _ just as Glubb was trying to do in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   But Hassan could not be packed off to Amman airport. Instead,
the king came home, disgraced his brother and picked another
Sandhurst graduate as regent _ a man, ironically, of whom Glubb
Pasha would have approved _ Hussein's eldest son, Abdullah... &QL;

   All across the Arab world, age and sickness haunt the lands.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's King Hussein lies clinically dead in an Amman hospital,
having succumbed to his toughest enemy, cancer. Saudi Arabia's King
Fahd can barely stand, and stumbles on the simplest sentences.
Yasser Arafat suffers ever more from the brain tumor inflicted
after a near-fatal air crash. Syria's Hafez Assad suffers from a
heart condition, and has lost his heir-apparent son, Basil, in a
road accident. Egypt's Hosni Mubarak has never appointed a
vice-president, let alone a successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Succession'': it's the Middle East's unspoken crisis. The
great unmentionable. But it is real.
</P>
<P>
   We in the West, of course, accept the Arab world's odd,
dangerous system of inheritance. Why? Because we like
dictatorships. We know how to do business with the kings and
generals _ how to sell them our arms, fighter-bombers and missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that we, as well as the Arab regimes themselves,
have produced and maintained this archaic drama of crown princes
and beloved sons, of gulf sheikhdoms that are no more than the
private property of individual families... &QL;

   AMMAN _ King Hussein returned Friday to die in Jordan after
treatment for his cancer in the U.S. failed. He was rushed from the
plane in an ambulance to a closely guarded hospital where a palace
official said he was ``near death.''
</P>
<P>
   In Amman, the Jordanian capital, mosques were packed with people
praying for the king's recovery. ``I hope God gives him more
days,'' said one Jordanian who had just left the mosque. ``The
Jordanians and the Palestinians both liked him.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the twists and turns of his policy the king was
genuinely popular among ordinary Jordanians, few of whom have known
any other monarch.
</P>
<P>
   Parties have been cancelled in the capital over the last week
and there was a minor run on the banks. Some people were openly
crying in the streets Friday morning as they heard the news that
the king was close to death. &QL;

<P>
   All across the Arab world, age and sickness haunt the lands.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's King Hussein lies clinically dead in an Amman hospital,
having succumbed to his toughest enemy, cancer. Saudi Arabia's King
Fahd can barely stand, and stumbles on the simplest sentences.
Yasser Arafat suffers ever more from the brain tumor inflicted
after a near-fatal air crash. Syria's Hafez Assad suffers from a
heart condition, and has lost his heir-apparent son, Basil, in a
road accident. Egypt's Hosni Mubarak has never appointed a
vice-president, let alone a successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Succession'': it's the Middle East's unspoken crisis. The
great unmentionable. But it is real.
</P>
<P>
   We in the West, of course, accept the Arab world's odd,
dangerous system of inheritance. Why? Because we like
dictatorships. We know how to do business with the kings and
generals _ how to sell them our arms, fighter-bombers and missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that we, as well as the Arab regimes themselves,
have produced and maintained this archaic drama of crown princes
and beloved sons, of gulf sheikhdoms that are no more than the
private property of individual families... &QL;

<P>
   AMMAN _ King Hussein returned Friday to die in Jordan after
treatment for his cancer in the U.S. failed. He was rushed from the
plane in an ambulance to a closely guarded hospital where a palace
official said he was ``near death.''
</P>
<P>
   In Amman, the Jordanian capital, mosques were packed with people
praying for the king's recovery. ``I hope God gives him more
days,'' said one Jordanian who had just left the mosque. ``The
Jordanians and the Palestinians both liked him.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the twists and turns of his policy the king was
genuinely popular among ordinary Jordanians, few of whom have known
any other monarch.
</P>
<P>
   Parties have been cancelled in the capital over the last week
and there was a minor run on the banks. Some people were openly
crying in the streets Friday morning as they heard the news that
the king was close to death. &QL;

SCHOOL OFFICIALS, PARENTS GRAPPLE WITH RACE, VIOLENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (Daily News Staff Writer Jesse Hiestand contributed to this
story.)

By LISA VAN PROYEN and DAVID R. BAKER 
c.1997 Los Angeles Daily News  
LOS ANGELES -- More than 50 principals from the city's northern
suburbs met to talk about the racially charged beating of their
colleague, while more than half of the teachers at Burton Street
Elementary School rallied in support of their recovering principal.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles detectives, meanwhile, were optimistic Friday they
will arrest the two men who Norman G. Bernstein said beat him
unconscious outside the school Monday. Police said they have
widespread support in the school's community, located in the
northeastern San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors and the Los Angeles
school board will vote Tuesday to offer separate $25,000 rewards
for information leading to the capture and conviction of
Bernstein's attackers. The Jewish Defense League on Friday
announced a $2,000 reward.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein was recuperating at his home Friday and was expected
to return to school in a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings came as parents, teachers and school officials
struggled with the possibility that racial conflicts might have
contributed to the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The 65-year-old Bernstein told police his attackers said: ``We
don't want you here anymore, principal. Do you understand that,
white principal?''
</P>
<P>
   He said one of the men was speaking Spanish, but had no
description of either of them.
</P>
<P>
   District officials Friday confirmed that concerns have been
raised within the past six months about Bernstein's management
style and his handling of the state-ordered elimination of
bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
   In a June 8 letter to Dan Issacs, a Los Angeles Unified School
District assistant superintendent for school operations, a group of
Burton parents wrote that they had ``serious concerns,'' even after
speaking with top administrators, including Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   Among the concerns were:
</P>
<P>
   --Faculty members making racially offensive comments during
meetings the principal attended.
</P>
<P>
   --Teachers being tardy to class.
</P>
<P>
   --Inadequate parent representation at meetings, including those
involving the school going to a year-round schedule and Proposition
227, the bilingual education initiative.
</P>
<P>
   --Verbal abuse of children.
</P>
<P>
   --Inappropriate playground supervision.
</P>
<P>
   --Poor examples set by teacher assistants, including wearing
rings on their tongues.
</P>
<P>
   They also complained Bernstein was not supporting the bilingual
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``He puts teachers who are not bilingual in bilingual classes,''
the parents wrote in the June 8 letter.
</P>
<P>
   The parents also cited concerns about the principal not
supporting the celebration of Cinco de Mayo.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein could not be reached Friday for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Parents were working with administrators, said a school employee
who asked not to be identified out of fear of being fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were going through the proper channels. This destroys
their credibility and they have real issues _ real, real issues,''
the employee said.
</P>
<P>
   Parents, the employee said, believe the teachers union at the
school is in control under an ``ineffective principal.''
</P>
<P>
   Isaacs could not be reached for comment Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on behalf of the 25 teachers who rallied at the school
Friday, union representative Bonnie Tompkins said the atmosphere of
dissension was only recently identified by parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just recently learned that we may lose our principal. ...
We don't want our principal to be removed. We want him back,''
Tompkins said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was given information that he was to be removed because he
was neither bilingual nor Latino,'' Tompkins said of the principal.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Eli Brent, president of the Associated
Administrators of Los Angeles, said Bernstein told him recently
that he faced a possible demotion by the district because ``the
school was not settling down.''
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the teachers' comments, some Burton parent leaders
said they were appalled that the issues are being reduced to claims
that they want a Latino principal who is bilingual at the school,
whose 750-student body is 89 percent Latino.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disturbing,'' said one parent who asked not to be
identified. ``We feel that the teachers are making it a racial
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The parents have questioned the principal's account of the
attack and wondered why he did not call police before he contacted
his own office.
</P>
<P>
   The principals who met with district officials at Mulholland
Middle School on Friday sought an update on the investigation and a
district response, said John Liechty, assistant superintendent of
instruction assigned to the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us,'' he said.
``What happened to Norman Bernstein, a colleague, obviously raised
some concern about safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Yvonne Chan said she became principal of Vaughn Street School in
1990 in the midst of an ethnic feud in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   She brought the factions together by improving school safety and
listening to everyone, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is not the color, not where you're born _
it's whether you can communicate with the community,'' she said.
``And communication doesn't necessarily mean speaking the same
language.''
</P>
<P>
   District officials will hold a mediation meeting Monday with
Liechty, teachers, parents and organizers of the Days of Dialogue,
a series of interracial discussions started by Los Angeles
Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas.

FANS WARM UP TO RETURN OF NBA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ They love it. They know it. And on Friday
they weren't afraid to show it.
</P>
<P>
   The fans at the Los Angeles Lakers' season opener against
Houston were in midseason form even if the Lakers and Rockets were
not. The sellout crowd of 17,505 came late and left early, before
Eddie Jones put the finishing polish on the Lakers' 99-91 win.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA may have shown a reckless disregard for its fans by
staging a four-month lockout, but on this night all seemed
forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, taking the temperature of fans outside the Forum to
gauge NBA fever was like collecting opinions about the pope's
recent trip to the United States from people on their way into a
Roman Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the faithful were flush with excitement. They had
braved the worst traffic conditions imaginable _ getaway Friday,
rush hour, rain _ and temperatures almost as cold as Jones'
first-quarter shooting to be there, hadn't they? If that's not
commitment, it's sufficient grounds to be committed.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice to say that Dale Madison and his three buddies who were
having a good ol' time tailgating in the reserved parking lot at
the Forum three hours before the start of the game were not among
the 53percent who responded to a recent national survey by saying
they had missed pro basketball ``only a little'' or ``not at all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were dying,'' Madison said as he poked at a piece of
poultry on his handy hibachi. And what did he call this First
Supper?
</P>
<P>
   ``Chick-en Hearn,'' Madison said, grinning.
</P>
<P>
   But of course.
</P>
<P>
   You could say Madison and his friends Tim Arebalo, Ben Correa
and Jason Jimenez are sick, and you'd be technically correct. They
all came down with the flu sometime after noon and left their jobs
early. That was the only way they could beat the traffic into L.A.
from their hometown of Chino.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we do for the Lakers,'' Madison said between gulps
of rum and Coke.
</P>
<P>
   If their tortillas were getting soggy because of the rain,
Madison and his buddies didn't seem to notice.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a zealot to find satisfaction in soggy chicken and
sloppy basketball. And it takes some kind of devoutness to gather
outside the players' tunnel a couple of hours before the opening
tip and just stand there and be spit on by clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Smith, Jo Santos and Albert Bungay let their smiles be
their umbrella. After four months of sitting around and waiting for
the NBA season to begin, nothing could dampen their spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were missing the players,'' Smith said as her friends
nodded.
</P>
<P>
   And if none of the players rolled down their windows to sign an
autograph or 20 before their cars disappeared down the tunnel,
well, at least most of them smiled and waved as they coasted by.
</P>
<P>
   That may have been enough to mollify the likes of Smith, Santos
and Bungay, but frankly, Arlene Herrera had been hoping for a
little more love. Two hours before the opening tip she also was
standing near the tunnel, hugging a hodgepodge of pictures that she
wanted the players to sign.
</P>
<P>
   She figured they'd be a bit more accommodating, after what the
league put its fans through these past few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't they owe us at least a smile or an autograph?'' Herrera
wondered aloud.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Ebdane could have told her she was all wet if she thought
she'd be rewarded for standing out in the rain.
</P>
<P>
   When the Lakers were in Santa Barbara for training camp, Ebdane
and his buddies drove from their homes in Oxnard to UCSB to obtain
the players' autographs.
</P>
<P>
   They said they were roundly ignored by everybody except Kobe
Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't make so much money, but we always support the
Lakers,'' Ebdane said. ``At least they can give us autographs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebdane was standing outside the Forum Club with a camcorder
cradled in one hand, killing time and chilling out after making the
two-hour drive from Oxnard. Having given up on getting the
attention of the players, he had shifted his focus to other
celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   He already had recorded the entrances of Lakers Executive Vice
President Jerry West and former USC star-turned-commentator Cheryl
Miller and was hopeful of catching Jack Nicholson, or perhaps Dyan
Cannon and other female cast members of ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   As Ebdane stared entranced at the Forum Club entrance, his
friend Jesse Dumava looked at him and laughed. ``This guy was so
excited last night,'' Dumava said, ``he couldn't sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   If you were sleepwalking toward the Forum doors some 90 minutes
before the game, you were in danger of being wiped out by a
green-and-yellow wave that rolled in like high tide from the
parking lot at Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   A large group of rowdy college exchange students from San Diego
spilled out toward the arena. The way they were chanting, you would
have thought they were on their way to a soccer friendly.
</P>
<P>
   What in the world were they saying?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't explain it,'' said Rafael Zarvos. ``This is my first
time at an NBA game.''
</P>
<P>
   Once inside the building, he would say, his voice filled with
wonderment, ``I don't believe I can see Shaquille O'Neal.''
</P>
<P>
   How hard was it going four months without watching O'Neal brick
a free throw? Joseph Nelson of Westchester said he gave up beef
awhile back, and not having the NBA on his plate was a lot harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be wanting that roundball,'' Nelson said, ``just like I'd
be wanting that steak.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the sirloin _ for one night, at least, the sizzle was
enough.

SONICS A TOUGH READ AMID NBA'S `MIDSEASON' PARITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ As is customary at this early February juncture of the
NBA season, it's time for the midseason report card.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most remarkable thing about the season so far is the
parity. Who could have imagined last summer that by the All-Star
Game break every team in the league would be either tied for the
divisional lead or no more than one game back?
</P>
<P>
   For years, the NFL has worked actively toward this kind of
balance. But as the sports fan has come to learn this decade, the
NBA always seems to be a step quicker than every other sport.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA puts to shame major league baseball, where more than
half the teams will enter spring training with no hope of a
championship, thanks to huge, unchecked revenue disparities between
franchises.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here is pro hoops, almost at Valentine's Day, and no team,
thanks to the NBA's enlightened, creative labor policies, is
anywhere close to elimination (with the possible exception of the
Clippers, who have an automatic entry into the NIT).
</P>
<P>
   And since every game at KeyArena has gone into overtime,
including Friday night's 92-86 win over the Dallas Mavericks, the
promise of excitement is almost unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   There is a problem, however. Such evenness makes it difficult to
distinguish the trends that will be difference-makers in the
season's second half. Other than the dominance of the Mavericks,
who have never beaten the Sonics this year, it is hard to make
sweeping assessments about the Seattle club.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, some Sonic and league developments are clear at
the mid-winter break:
</P>
<P>
   --Despite a change in management, Gary Payton still owns this
team. His season averages of 28 points, 7 rebounds and 6 assists
are testaments to the best guard in the game, now that
what's-his-name is back to selling phone service.
</P>
<P>
   --Soon-to-be-Thin Vin Baker is almost playing as well as he did
during the last regular season. But his season doesn't start until
he makes everyone forget last year's playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   --Given George Karl's magnificent regular-season record, Sonic
fans were naturally concerned that the transition to new coach Paul
Westphal would be filled with problems. While Westphal is indeed a
thousand words behind Karl in the quote standings, the undefeated
record speaks eloquently to his basketball genius. Club president
Wally Walker has never made a more inspired coaching hire.
</P>
<P>
   --The shift of Hersey Hawkins from starting guard to reserve, to
accommodate the main offseason acquisition, Belly, er, Billy Owens,
is a bust. The controversial move so far has Owens averaging just 5
points in 22 minutes, while Hawkins, who gets the, ahem, bulk of
the minutes, has scored just two points all season.
</P>
<P>
   There is hope, however, as soon as the Sonics figure whether
Owens on defense has his feet nailed to the floor or merely glued.
</P>
<P>
   --The many scattered patches of empty seats at Key Arena,
particularly in the rich-people regions, is an ominous sign.
Although the building is said to be sold out regularly, it's plain
at least some fans this season prefer to stay at home with Jerry
Springer's TV show if they need to see chunky people pointing and
pushing.
</P>
<P>
   --The league's newest feature, a requirement that each player
shoot at least one airball a game, is taken far too seriously by
the Sonics. Just Friday night the Sonics shot 40 percent, and the
Mavericks missed 10 of 11 field goal attempts in overtime.
Nevertheless, fans of tradition can savor the 5-foot jump-hook
airball from Olden Polynice, who despite his seven-year absence
from Seattle is still packing his trademark.
</P>
<P>
   --Averaging a double-double (11 points, 13 rebounds), Polynice
should be considered just behind Shaquille O'Neal and David
Robinson in the voting for Western Conference All-Star center,
presuming voters in KeyArena are not injured by shrapnel from his
free throws.
</P>
<P>
   --Despite his 36 years, Detlef Schrempf hasn't lost so much as a
single adjective when it comes to complaining to the officials. The
ravages of age often cause many players to moderate, but Schrempf
has shown no loss of victimhood.
</P>
<P>
   --The Mavericks' Cedric Ceballos might be the greatest fat
player since Billy ``The Whopper'' Paultz. In the most recent game
Friday, the semi-cherubic forward had 16 points, including multiple
drives past Sonic defenders, who reinforced the long-ago conclusion
of third-grade spelling class that there is no D in Westphal.
</P>
<P>
   --In the Mavericks' starting frontline tandem of 7-foot-6 center
Shawn Bradley and 7-0 rookie forward Dirk Nowitzki, Northwest
residents have not seen so much slow whiteness since the Nisqually
Glacier.
</P>
<P>
   --In Moochie Norris, the Sonics have the greatest first name in
NBA back-up point guard history. But you knew that right from the
beginning of the season.
</P>
<P>
   So for the second half of the NBA season, the Sonics find
themselves well positioned _ closing in on the lead, backing away
from the buffet table and owning the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   How could Jordan walk away from this?

SUNS BEAT CLIPPERS IN SEASON OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On a Friday night crowded with first impressions,
the Phoenix Suns left the outline of a dreaded and familiar `L'
pushed into the Clippers logo.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Clippers _ who displayed enough pluck and
determination to take a shot at sabotaging their own annual
draft-lottery run _ lost to the Suns 101-92 after being the victims
of a 17-0 Phoenix run in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In front of 7,689 post-lockout witnesses at the lame-duck Sports
Arena, new coach Chris Ford boldly went where every Clippers coach
has gone before. Top draft pick Michael Olowokandi met his first
matchup in the NBA low post _ and he just happened to be Suns
veteran Danny Manning, the league and Clippers' No.1 pick in 1988.
As rumored since the labor tussle ended, All-Star forward Tom
Gugliotta began the season in Southern California _ but as a member
of the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought there were a lot of good things out there,'' said
Ford, who thought right. ``I hope the fans see that.''
</P>
<P>
   In their first application of Ford's player-friendly,
run-and-shoot offense, the Clippers made 11 of 23 field-goal
attempts in a 25-point first quarter. Point guard Darrick Martin _
who in theory is keeping the position warm until newcomer Sherman
Douglas takes over _ handed out six assists. He finished the game
with six. Backcourt partner Eric Piatkowski made two 3-pointers
during that stretch, and scored 11 points. He finished with a
team-high 16.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clippers still trailed by three.
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi joined the league and the battle with 1:44 left in
the quarter, and promptly missed a seven-foot one-hander. Jason
Kidd (18 points, 10 assists), the Suns' Energizer-bunny point
guard, converted a three-point play at 1:14 to give the Suns their
28-25 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   So the Clippers countered by going out and putting up 31 points
in the second quarter. The Suns _ behind 11 points from Gugliotta,
who had been a betting favorite to suit up for the Lakers _ kept
their hosts at arm's length for most of the period. Gugliotta
finished the half with 16 points and 10 rebounds. He finished the
game with game-highs of 24 and 17.
</P>
<P>
   But with Martin translating from Ford's equal-opportunity
playbook, the Clippers refused to wilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we played well in the first half,'' Ford said. ``We
only had five turnovers; a lot of good things were happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's one: With 35 seconds left before intermission, Olowokandi
took a pass on the left block, executed a frighteningly quick
baseline spin and dunked over Suns center Luc Longley, treating the
former Chicago Bull like he was, well, Luc Longley. That cut the
Phoenix lead to 53-50. Olowokandi, who finished with 14 points and
six rebounds in his NBA debut, had picked up a few clues while
watching from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while, I got a feel for what they (Suns) do on
defense,'' he said. ``I saw my openings and tried to take
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   After a free throw by Martin, the next Clippers hero was rookie
free-agent forward Tyrone Nesby, who dribbled and danced past
Gugliotta for a layup that tied the score at 53.
</P>
<P>
   The half concluded with Lamond Murray _ who made just 6 of 19
shots and finished with 14 points _ nailing a buzzer-beating runner
from midcourt that gave the Clippers a 56-53 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The 56 didn't seem so gaudy when the Clippers found themselves
stuck there until 6:07 of the third quarter. That's when Maurice
Taylor followed a miss with a five-foot baby hook for the Clippers'
first points of the half. Meanwhile, back in the NBA, the Suns were
making it ugly, running off 17 unanswered, undisturbed points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our defense broke down,'' Ford said. ``We quit
talking out there.''
</P>
<P>
   To impress loyal Clippers critics enough to generate any
positive chatter, the new coach will have to replicate and sustain
that first-half performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't let these guys get beaten down,'' Ford said. ``We've
got to build them up and get ready for the Bulls on Sunday.''

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ So there's your answer, loud and clear.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of educated guesses about what post-apocalypse pro
basketball would look and sound like, the Los Angeles Lakers and
Houston Rockets rang in the new year Friday night with a clank.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers won 99-91, and it wasn't quite pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Jones of the Lakers was way short on his first jump shot,
way long on his second, and nowhere close on his third on his way
to 2 for 12, the !ital!thunks!off! enhanced by technology, the
microphones bolted to the backboard and wired to the PA system.

   Charles Barkley of the Rockets went to the trouble of posting up
emergency Lakers starter Corey Blount only to get more backboard
than rim on his first try.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-three-year-old Scottie Pippen, nervous or just sloppy in
a 4-for-18 Rockets debut, thought about schooling 20-year-old Laker
Kobe Bryant and wound up with a running jump shot blocked back in
his face.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams were shooting 40 percent at the half. Even in the
'90s, that's bad. The Lakers got better as the night wore on, and
at this rate, they'll be in midseason form by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it'll still be watchable, decent basketball,'' Lakers
coach Del Harris had said before the game, not wanting to be
accused of overhyping the product. ``I don't think it'll be totally
sweeps (quality television).''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it didn't help the general quality that the Lakers
played without their scheduled starting forwards, Rick Fox (foot)
and Robert Horry (baby).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, maybe the messy parts would have been messy even if
this was game 33 of a normal season instead of game 1 of the
post-lockout season.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it also could get worse, after the enormity of the
50-games, 90-nights schedule sinks in, before marches like Denver's
eight games in 10 days and Minnesota's three West Coast trips in 16
days leave healthy young men feeling like Bob Dole on his last
ditch, 72-sleepless-hours campaign trek.
</P>
<P>
   The question then will be who's up to the unusual challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom cuts both ways, with either young teams like
the Lakers holding the edge on fitness or veteran teams like the
Rockets better off because they ``know how to take care of
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Do the old guys really have a secret?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Bryant, the Lakers' very young
guard/forward/tycoon, said, shrugging. ``I'm waiting to find that
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' inexperience has been a burden for two years but
could be a help this year, when they're not only still young and
basically healthy but also deep, with the prospect of a nine- or
10-man rotation to keep legs fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Against arthritic teams like Houston and Utah, two of their
Western rivals, and Indiana, the Eastern power of the post-Jordan
age, maybe they'd be advised to turn up the tempo and try to tire
the old men out.
</P>
<P>
   Houston has six guys over 30, four over 33, including Pippen
(coming off back surgery), Barkley (bad back) and Hakeem Olajuwon
(bum knee). Utah has four over 34, including its big two. Indiana's
lineup averages 32.9 years of age.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have !ital!one!off! man, Derek Harper, older than 30,
and should be able to run all night.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, nothing will win back shaken fans like a good fast
break.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully (they'll run) not just (against) the veteran
teams,'' said Derek Fisher, who as the starting point guard
controls the ball and the tempo as much as anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like over the past couple of years we've cheated
ourselves a little bit by playing too conservatively. We've got
players who are more suited to running.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounds like a call to abandon the thus-far futile quest for
a mature half-court attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Bryant said, ``a team like Houston, those veteran guys,
they know how to conserve their bodies. They're not going to let
you run them off the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   A return to Showtime seems a remote possibility, and, in fact,
the Rockets outscored the Lakers 17-9 on ``fast break points,''
however the official scorer defines them.
</P>
<P>
   Harris isn't exactly a running coach. And in the '97-98 season _
back when NBA seasons came with hyphens _ when Nick Van Exel was
sidelined the Lakers became more deliberate than usual. And now Van
Exel is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in here is the rationale for signing Dennis Rodman,
who would get the rebounds and turnovers off of which a fast break
feeds.
</P>
<P>
   Or somewhere in here is a plea for the Lakers to push the
fast-forward button on that offense.
</P>
<P>
   This game got better and ultimately might even be termed
intense. But based on first post-lockout impressions, watching the
Lakers run would be more fun than watching them shoot. &QL;

BRYANT SPARKS LAKERS IN OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ When at last the extended offseason of woe
ended, and the NBA turned away from its labor war and the end of
the Michael Jordan era, it figured to be a while, perhaps years,
before the league's future would come into focus under a new star.
</P>
<P>
   But impatient Kobe Bryant didn't wait for his cue. And Shaquille
O'Neal didn't wait for anything, period.
</P>
<P>
   Unusual events felled two Los Angeles Lakers starters Friday,
and suddenly, Bryant was making his first career opening-night
start, and under the most intense of spotlights. Against the
Hall-of-Famer-heavy Houston Rockets. Against Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   And Bryant being Bryant, he wasted no time asserting himself,
scoring 25 points to lead the Lakers to a 99-91 victory over the
Rockets at the Forum. O'Neal started slowly but finished with a
team-high 30 points and 14 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal worked over Hakeem Olajuwon, but even with his size and
muscle, Shaq couldn't wrest the limelight away from the 20-year-old
Bryant. He scored seven points in the first quarter, outplayed
Pippen the entire game and finished with his first career
double-double, adding a career-high 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, who has more championship rings (six) than Bryant has
career starts (two), managed just 10 points and hit 4 of 18 shots
against Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magnificent,'' coach Del Harris said of his third-string small
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to take away, when you look at Shaq's 30 (points),
14 (rebounds) and six (assists) and he is The Man, but the story I
think probably has to be (Bryant). Here's Kobe coming in, starting
against Scottie Pippen, and ... nine out of 10 people are gonna
give the edge to Houston on that one.''
</P>
<P>
   Person No. 10, of course, would be Bryant himself.
</P>
<P>
   And did we mention his three blocked shots and two steals?
</P>
<P>
   ``A pretty good start,'' Bryant said. ``I have a lot of things
that I'm mad at myself about, but it was a good start.... I didn't
think I was in a rhythm at all, really. My jump shot was off.''
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to notice with all the fireworks he put up.
</P>
<P>
   And that show upstaged other breakthrough performances for the
Lakers. Derek Harper, entering his 16th season but first as a
Laker, posted 16 points and seven assists off the bench, and the
Lakers' big men, Elden Campbell, Travis Knight and Sean Rooks,
combined to help keep Olajuwon and Charles Barkley in check.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley nevertheless finished with a game-high 31 points and 15
rebounds. Olajuwon had 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers trailed at halftime 46-43 but led most of the second
half. Houston pulled within four 90-86 on Barkley's seven-foot
jumper with 3:11 remaining, and again 93-89 on a Barkley free
throw. But the Lakers put it away with four straight free throws by
Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   By all rights, Bryant will probably return to the bench, if not
Sunday then Monday. But it might be difficult to make that case.
</P>
<P>
   Harris intends to use Bryant off the bench again this season,
his third in the NBA, but the coach had no choice Friday. Starter
Rick Fox is hampered by sore ankles and knees and is a question
mark for Sunday's game against Utah. Robert Horry, Harris' next
preferred option, was in Houston with his wife and newborn son.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bryant looks to be playing Lou Gehrig to Fox's Wally Pipp.
Harris has said he didn't want to start Bryant until he was ready
to be the starter for the rest of his career, and he indicated Fox
wouldn't lose his starting job to injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, when Kobe Bryant obviously establishes himself as a
guy that you just can't keep out of the starting lineup, you put
him there, and he'll stay in there for the next 10 or 12 years,''
Harris said. ``That's what you would hope for, and that could
happen at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it already has.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Horry's wife Keva gave birth to their second child,
Robert Camron Horry, at 5 p.m. CST. He weighs 8 pounds, 11 ounces,
and both mother and baby were said to be doing fine.... Barkley was
wearing a pair of Air Jordans, with Michael's No. 23 imprinted on
the heels. ``Nike said they wanted other players to wear Michael's
shoes as a tribute to him,'' Barkley said, ``but I know better.
They just wanted the other guys to sell his shoes for him.''

PAYTON RULES IN OT AS SONICS WIN OPENER UNDER WESTPHAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ No one knows exactly what to expect during this
abbreviated NBA season.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Sonics' 92-86 overtime win Friday against the Dallas
Mavericks proved anything, it is that there will be at least four
strong denominators in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The fans.
</P>
<P>
   Defense.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton.
</P>
<P>
   And the fans.
</P>
<P>
   With the Dallas Mavericks, those Western Conference beasts,
giving the Sonics fits, Payton threw an overtime tantrum of his
own, scoring six of the team's eight points in the extra period.
And the Sonics, who figured to rely on offensive outbursts,
benefited most from their defensive pressure to hold off the Mavs.
</P>
<P>
   All that, of course, with the encouragement of a raucous and
sold out KeyArena. It was an impressive start to what promises to
be an intense 50-game regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The game also begged the question: What lockout?
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans did a good job,'' Payton said. ``They came back.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Sonics forward Vin Baker: ``The fans were incredible. If
anybody from the NBA came into KeyArena last night, you'd think we
never left.''
</P>
<P>
   Some things just never change.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas pushed the Sonics for the second straight home opener. A
year ago, the Mavs spoiled the Sonics' home debut with a 89-81
victory. But Payton put the Sonics on his back in typical fashion.
</P>
<P>
   He scored a game-high 28 points, 14 in the fourth quarter and
overtime, and played 44 minutes. The effort preserved coach Paul
Westphal's first Sonic victory after replacing George Karl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean to take him for granted and I'm taking him for
granted already,'' Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   When the game entered overtime, Westphal told Payton to take
over.
</P>
<P>
   He was getting to the basket relatively easy against a much
smaller Steve Nash.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavs were debating whether to double team Payton. When they
did, he found the open man for a jump shot. When they didn't,
Payton beat one-on-one coverage with hard drives toward the rim.
</P>
<P>
   While Dallas missed its first eight shots in the extra period,
Payton owned the baseline, where he converted short-range baskets.
His last field goal gave the Sonics a 90-84 lead with 2:15 left.
Detlef Schrempf's two free throws with 10.7 seconds left ice it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play the way we was supposed to. We still have a few
kinks to get out,'' Payton said. ``But it was good to win this way.
... Coach put it on my back. He told me to keep the ball in my
hands. Either I'm going to be the hero or the goat. I'll take
either one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics missed their chance to win in regulation when Baker's
hook shot bounced off with 32 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavs then squandered two chances to end the game. Steve Nash
misfired on a 3-pointer. A.C. Green gathered the rebound with 4.9
ticks left, but Cedric Ceballos lost the ball as he drove the
baseline and the game went into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos and Michael Finley struggled against the Sonics'
defense. Dale Ellis and Billy Owens held them to a combined 25
points.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, who started at shooting guard in place of Hersey Hawkins,
held his own even with a broken left pinky finger. He suffered the
injury during his third practice with the Sonics, but kept it a
secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had great contributions defensively from Olden
(Polynice),'' Wesphal said, ``and Billy came in and really did a
great job on Finley. ... But it was really everybody _ we won the
game with defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics flashed their best defensive effort after they fell
behind 70-64 early in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   After Moochie Norris buried a wide-open 3-pointer, Hawkins
parlayed a steal into an easy layup that pulled the Sonics within
70-69.
</P>
<P>
   Erick Strickland answered for Dallas with a layup. But Baker
swatted away Strickland's very next layup attempt, and ignited a
fastbreak. Hawkins sprinted up court and found Ellis, who quickly
canned a wide-open 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   Payton then forced Strickland to lose the ball and converted an
uncontested layup. The Sonics eventually went ahead 76-72 on Ellis'
putback with 6:41 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The sequence wasn't enough to put the Mavs away.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas responded with a 10-4 run. Nash and Finley ignited the
spurt with a pair of 3-pointers. Ceballos' two free throws later
tied the score at 82-82 with 2:50 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sonics owned the boards, 52-42, behind Polynice's 13
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to be booed,'' Polynice said. ``I know I can
rebound with anybody in this league. I didn't do anything
spectacular. I just did what I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, both teams accounted for just 16 turnovers. The
Sonics and Mavs both played up-tempo styles and both teams shot
just 40 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll bet you in a lot of arenas, teams that are playing sloppy
are getting booed,'' Owens said. ``We didn't hear any boos. All we
heard was encouragement.''

   OLY-SAMARANCH (Barcelona) _ Special Report: In the past two
months, with the Olympic movement battered by allegations of
corruption at Salt Lake City and elsewhere, Juan Antonio Samaranch
has sought to bridge the gap between his retiring personality and
insistent images of uncontrolled indulgence. For his supporters, he
remains a servant of sport who transformed the Olympics from
financial ruin to unimagined prosperity. But an examination of
Samaranch's life, based on interviews in Europe, Asia and North
America, suggests that at the least he had no enthusiasm for
uncovering wrongdoing in the Olympic movement and may have
encouraged it through his own example as he pursued his consuming
goal of broadening and enriching the Olympics. By Roger Cohen with

   WASHINGTON _ Our little girl has grown up.
</P>
<P>
   She has had her ditsy moments and she has made her mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   But anybody who survives Bill Clinton, Ken Starr, Linda Tripp,
William Ginsburg, the House managers and the press beast is bound

<P>
   And Monica Lewinsky has.

   Being interrogated about her improvident romance for the 23rd

him into a stammering schoolboy.

   ``OK,'' the former U.S. attorney asked the 25-year-old, ``Um,
tell me how you, um, began _ I guess the _ the _ we're going to
talk about a relationship with the president. Uh, when you first,
uh, I guess, saw him, I think there was some indication that you
didn't speak to him maybe the first few times you saw him, but you
had some eye contact or sort of smiles or ... ''
</P>
<P>
   The saucy and wily Monica was up to the crucial task of putting
the clueless House managers in their place. Clearly she had
absorbed some lessons from her old boyfriend, the operator. She
showed a knack for not remembering. She would say she wasn't
``comfortable'' responding to a question. She gave the ``vanilla,''
or innocuous, view of suspicious events. And, like Clinton, she
shined in comparison to the other side.
</P>
<P>
   Monica swatted aside Bryant's lame foray into prurience and
chastised him for characterizing her first tryst with the president
as a ``so-called salacious occasion.'' She suggested the more
neutral ``encounter.''
</P>
<P>
   He knew he was overmatched, comparing Monica to Marlene
Dietrich, who saved her man with dazzling _ if duplicitous _
testimony in ``Witness for the Prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   When he said of Clinton, ``I assume you think he's a very
intelligent man,'' Monica shot back: ``I think he's an intelligent
president.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, ``intelligent man'' is often an oxymoron. When
testosterone hits high tide, the judgment of highly placed men goes
splat.
</P>
<P>
   That is why this trial is so loony. Congress has an illustrious
history of politicians having affairs with younger female aides and
lying about it. The House managers pretend to be outraged that
Clinton lied to Sidney Blumenthal about Monica. As if members of
Congress never lie to aides intending that the lies be repeated?
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have acted like cheap hypocrites. Americans hate
unfairness, and they know that Ken Starr's partisan, relentless
conduct has tainted his investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The president behaved terribly. But he was entrapped into lying
by his scheming political enemies, a hideous cabal that included
New York literary agent Lucianne Goldberg, Ms. Tripp and the
lawyers for Paula Jones. It was fortified by a clique of young,
conservative lawyers who secretly worked on the Jones lawsuit from
its inception and then helped orchestrate Ms. Tripp's fateful call
to Starr. Despite the prosecutor's denials that his office colluded
with the Jones lawyers, those ties have been exposed in the
brilliant stories of The New York Times' Don Van Natta and Jill
Abramson.
</P>
<P>
   The week was dominated by two young women, one on the cover of
The New Yorker, the other on the cover of People.
</P>
<P>
   Monica, who was portrayed in The New Yorker as an unmysterious
Mona Lisa, has complained to friends that her life has become ``The
Truman Show.'' Chelsea made the cover of People, and the president
and first lady pitched a fit, even though the story was nice.
</P>
<P>
   The press deserves credit for the taste and discretion it has
shown concerning Chelsea. If politicians don't want their families
covered, perhaps they should stop using their families to promote,
shield and rescue them, and as their photo-op hand-holders.
</P>
<P>
   This president should start taking responsibility for his own
messes. He should stop blaming the press for the discomfort his
daughter has suffered due to coverage of his escapades. They are
 &UR; his &LR;  escapades.
</P>
<P>
   As he huffily demands that one young woman be protected from the
media monster, he did not hesitate to let another young woman be
eaten by it.
</P>
<P>
   He told Sidney Blumenthal that Monica was a stalker. Hillary
told Sidney that Monica was a ``troubled'' young woman who
misunderstood the president's generous attempts to ``minister'' to
her.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arranges his chaotic world in a Madonna-whore construct.
He expects his ``good'' girls to rescue him when his ``bad'' girls
tell all. The president should grow up.
</P>
<P>
   Monica has.

SPORTS COLUMN: ARTHUR RICHMAN'S BASEBALL LOVE-IN  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the premiere of the official 1998 World Series video ended
not long ago and the lights went on, Joe Torre turned toward a
balding, bespectacled man in the back of the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you, Arthur Richman,'' the Yankee manager said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre's banker, along with George Steinbrenner and every
Yankee fan, should love Arthur Richman, too. And all that love will
hug Richman at the New York Baseball Writers Dinner Sunday night
when he is honored with the William J. Slocum Award for long and
meritorious service.
</P>
<P>
   The 72-year-old Richman, once a sportswriter with The Daily
Mirror and a Mets executive for nearly three decades, is now a
senior adviser in the Yankee hierarchy. ``George Steinbrenner and I
fight all the time,'' he was saying, surrounded by more than a
hundred photos on the walls of his Yankee Stadium office. ``An hour
later, we go out to dinner together.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the Yankees needed a new manager for the 1996 season,
they didn't fight. Instead, Steinbrenner asked Richman to recommend
replacements for Buck Showalter.
</P>
<P>
   ``George told me, `Make me up a list,''' Richman recalled.
</P>
<P>
   His list had four names: Tony La Russa, Davey Johnson, Sparky
Anderson and Torre. But La Russa was about to sign a $1.5 million
contract with the St. Louis Cardinals, Johnson was about to be
hired as the Baltimore Orioles' manager, and Anderson was content
in retirement in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``George interviewed Joe for the general manager's job, but Joe
didn't want it,'' Richman said. ``I told George that Joe really
would prefer to manage.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Yankees announced Torre as the new dugout manager,
skeptics pounced. One tabloid headline described him as Clueless
Joe. In 14 seasons as a manager with the Mets, the Atlanta Braves
and the Cardinals, Torre had had only one first-place team.
</P>
<P>
   ``When George saw the papers, he asked me, `Do you know what
you're doing?''' Richman said. ``I told him, `If I don't, fire
me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Richman knew Torre with the Mets for five years, when Richman
was the traveling secretary and Torre was the manager. He knew
Torre as a New Yorker from Brooklyn who understood New York. He
knew that Torre's quiet toughness wouldn't wilt under
Steinbrenner's tyranny. And with two World Series rings in three
seasons, Torre has fulfilled Richman's faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe should love me,'' Richman said with a laugh. ``He's going
to be making $2 million this year. Whenever he stops managing,
he'll never have to work again.''
</P>
<P>
   Richman would tell you that he has never really worked at all,
dating to 1942 when he was hired as a copy boy by The Daily
Mirror's legendary sports editor, Dan Parker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who else would work for $11.88 a week when older guys were
making $90 a week in war plants?'' he said. ``But when Dan Parker
hired me, that started my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a long and meritorious life shared for decades with
his late brother, Milton, a renowned sportswriter with United Press
International; with his wife, Martha, since 1979; and with
thousands of baseball people, notably Don Larsen, the Yankee
right-hander who pitched a perfect game in the 1956 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hung out with Donnie then,'' he said. ``Everybody thinks he
was drunk the night before, but we just went to Billy Taylor's bar
on West 57th Street, had a few toddies and went back to the Grand
Concourse Hotel, where he was living. He went out for a pizza, came
back and told me, `I might pitch a no-hitter tomorrow.'''
</P>
<P>
   When Larsen was married, Richman was his best man. And when
Richman was married, his best man was Willie Mays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several other guys stood up for me, too,'' Richman said.
``Ernie Banks, Ralph Kiner, Joe Torre, Dick Williams, Lee Mazzilli,
Joe Pignatano, Ted Sizemore and Doug Flynn.''
</P>
<P>
   Richman joined the Yankees in 1989 as a vice president of media
relations, a job that, in the Steinbrenner regime, had never been
known for its longevity. But he's still there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been fired 15 times and I've quit 20 times,'' Richman
said with a laugh. ``George will see me and say, `I thought you
left,' and I'll tell him, `How can I leave?' George gets on me for
having a toddy now and then, but I tell him, `My doctors told me I
have to drink to relieve the stress that you cause me.'''
</P>
<P>
   For all his Yankee loyalty now, Richman hasn't forgotten his
first baseball love: the St. Louis Browns of the early 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Bronx kid hanging around the Stadium, I'd see the Yankee
players come down from the Grand Concourse Hotel and walk right by
me,'' he said. ``But the visiting players always came by subway. I
was virtually adopted by some of those Browns. They took me into
the ball park. Sometimes they even took me on their train trips.
When the conductor came around, they'd hide me in an upper berth.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Richman turned to a photo of the 1944 Browns celebrating
their clinching of the American League pennant.
</P>
<P>
   ``See the white cap they're wearing; there's no insignia on it,
just a few brown and gold stripes,'' he said. ``I've got one of
those caps. I told Martha: `At my funeral, I want that cap buried
with me. Just be sure no collector steals it before they close the
coffin.'''

SPORTS COLUMN: THE DOGS SHOW UP THE CATS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The canine super bowl opens Monday and these tradition-bound
pages, as usual, will roll over for it. After all, the Westminster
Kennel Club show at Madison Square Garden is a ``major fixture''
with rich, ancient franchises, paeans to fine breeding, breathless
television analyses of poise and conformation, maybe even a betting
line. There will be rookies, veterans, passionate fans. It has
everything a big-league spectacular needs and little to fear; no
tall dog is expected to slip out on his handler tonight looking for
action on Eighth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, on its little paws, the Cat Show will pad
into town. A feline super bowl it is not. No one from this
department will be sent to interview the top tabby, to decipher
millennial attitudes from the popularity of specific breeds. As far
as we're concerned, the dog show is an athletic competition, the
cat show is a fur exhibition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How come?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much sporting about cats,'' said Roger Caras,
whose books and broadcasts have made him a leading animal expert.
``Cats don't perform. They just sit there. You feed them. They are
the most economically insignificant of all domestic animals. They
have this reputation of being independent, but they are animals who
have given up their independence so they can be taken care of. Cats
and dogs should not be compared.''
</P>
<P>
   Caras' voice, crisp and authoritative, softened: ``The first
time I saw a Border Collie at work, tears came to my eyes. It was
astounding. The ballet of that incredible work, the intelligence,
the energy.''
</P>
<P>
   I told him a friend of mine thinks cats are self-starters who
will go after mice without being asked, while dogs, often lazy and
stupid, will watch mice play.
</P>
<P>
   Caras snorted. ``Dogs are far better mousers than cats. I've got
a Jack Russell terrier, one of the 27 animals including cats in my
house right now, who is incredible at hunting vermin. Cats are
important if you are lonely; they are for loving, and that's real.
But their only function is companionship.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a slight gasp when I recounted this to Christine
MacMurray, the medical editor of the Animal Medical Center in New
York. ``Roger Caras said that?'' she said. ``Why would you even
compare dogs and cats? They are as different as elephants and
tigers. Oh, you asked the question.''
</P>
<P>
   When I asked MacMurray if she thought it was fair that we
covered the dog show and not the cat show, she made a sound like a
yawn. ``I won't be reading about either one, much less going to
them,'' she said. ``I'm sure there is some value in celebrating the
best, but most of this is about advertising for breeders. Those of
us in the animal advocacy world are more interested in controlling
the populations so that millions of cats and dogs _ including
purebreds _ are not killed every year.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not exactly where I wanted to go. The question on my
mind had been simple: Why do we give so much more attention to a
show featuring dogs than to a show featuring cats? Could it be that
the patriarchal media have made a connection with the perceived
masculinity of The Dog (top dog, big dog, dawg)?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' said Caras. ``There is nothing more masculine than an
old tom cat. A very rough animal. And they don't call a female dog
a bitch for no reason.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't many pet owners see a powerful dog as an affirmation
of their own masculinity?
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me quote some friends,'' said Caras. ``Joe Garagiola loves
little fluffy dogs, like Yorkies, and he's very secure in his
masculinity. Gretchen Wyler, that wonderful performer, told me that
a dog is her child that will never grow up, and a horse is her
dancing partner.''
</P>
<P>
   MacMurray said she was glad I had brought horses into the
conversation. Besides being treasurer of Pets Alive, a group that
rescues animals, including horses, she has very strong feelings
about best friends and dancing partners in the sports world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see horse racing and dog racing made illegal,''
she said. ``It's a form of abuse. Greyhounds live terrible lives. I
don't know much about race horses.'' I told her that it was the
human grooms who lived badly at the race track, but that few horses
had golden feed bags. Rendering trucks cruise the race tracks for
horses that break down or don't win enough. Losers become glue or
food for dogs and Frenchmen.
</P>
<P>
   MacMurray shuddered. ``Thanks for calling, Bob,'' she said.
``But back to your original question. These extravagant shows about
cats and dogs don't help the problem. The audience doesn't see the
irresponsible breeders, the puppy mills, the dogs discarded after
summer vacations, the cats prowling the alleys of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   But isn't that about bad human breeding? These shows are about
good animal genes. Caras said, ``We want to pick out those who best
represent the breed, and make sure their genetic material is
preserved.''
</P>

SHANAHAN FOCUS: BE PREPARED  
 DRAFT CHALLENGES THE BROWNS  
 MARINO SEEKS 3 OR 4 MORE SEASONS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Denver Broncos running back Derek Loville put it the best: there
is no better coach in professional football at preparing for the
big game than Mike Shanahan. And Shanahan showed it in Super Bowl
XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we were going to win the Super Bowl even before we got
to Miami,'' Loville said. ``Only I didn't shoot my mouth off like
Atlanta did. But we put in our game plan before we came to Miami;
so all we had to do was refine things once we got to the Super
Bowl. I remember thinking, `There is no way Atlanta is preparing as
hard as we are. No way.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike went over every little thing, down to the smallest
wrinkle in the game plan. That is his personality, getting involved
in everything and not leaving anything to chance. We did everything
right. We were calm, professional, we were in bed early, we were
well-coached. It's all because of Mike. He was organized down to
the letter. I don't think the Falcons had a real shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan's techniques during the intense time that is Super Bowl
week could serve as a blueprint for all coaches, young and old, in
the National Football League. The Broncos were well-rested,
prepared for everything Atlanta tried and, over all, more mentally
ready. That is all Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word Mike always used was focus,'' Broncos quarterback
John Elway said. ``Focus, focus, focus.'' And unlike some coaches,
Shanahan practices what he preaches.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Illustrated reported that six hours before kickoff,
Shanahan was watching the movie ``A Night at the Roxbury'' with his
son, Kyle, in the hotel room. Suddenly Shanahan darted out,
carrying his cue card with all the Bronco plays, and went to
Elway's room to go over the offense. In fact, that card rarely left
Shanahan's hands all week. That's focus.
</P>
<P>
   To win, Shanahan used his Super Bowl formula. It includes:
</P>
<P>
   USE TIME WISELY &UR;  &LR; _ If there is a week break before the big week,
as there was before Super Bowl XXXIII, put in the game plan before
arriving in the host city. That's what the Broncos did, and it made
their practices in Miami go more smoothly. The Falcons put in their
game plan the week of the game, and at times Falcons looked lost,
such as when safety Eugene Robinson gave up an 80-yard pass play
for a touchdown to Rod Smith because of blown coverage, or the
numerous blown blocking assignments.
</P>
<P>
   STICK TO ROUTINES _ From the time Atlanta's plane landed in
Miami, the Falcons were disoriented. Coach Dan Reeves changed the
order in which players got off the plane, and some complained.
Shanahan changed nothing, meaning players were never surprised.
That can be a major comfort in what is a turbulent week.
</P>
<P>
   KEEP FAMILIES OFF THE PLANE _ It sounds cruel, but football is a
cruel sport. Robinson admitted that having families travel with the
team, and in some cases stay with them in the team hotel, was a
distraction for both him and some teammates. Families of Denver
players were not allowed to travel with the team, and Shanahan kept
the players so busy that they rarely had time to spend with their
families once they got to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   WATCH YOUR MOUTH _ Reeves made a number of mistakes during the
week and in the game itself, but the biggest was taking shots at
Shanahan, basically calling him a traitor from the days when they
were in Denver. Bronco players said Reeves' comments only
intensified Shanahan's legendary competitiveness. Elway said the
game became personal for Shanahan. Then came Ray Buchanan, the
Falcon cornerback who guaranteed a victory. Atlanta players had to
answer questions about Buchanan's guarantee all week, as well as
about Reeves' comments regarding Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   ENFORCE STRICT RULES _ Call this the Eugene Robinson Act. The
Falcons enjoyed the night life all week, which would account for
why many of them were constantly late to sessions with the news
media. The night Robinson was arrested and charged with soliciting
prostitution, the Falcons had no team dinner or team meetings and
had no restrictions except a midnight curfew. The Broncos? They had
a team dinner around 7 p.m. and meetings from 8 to about 9:15,
followed by a mandatory light meal and an 11 p.m. curfew. Quite
simply, if Robinson had played for the Broncos, it is unlikely he
would have been arrested, because he would have been occupied.
</P>
<P>
   ADD SOME WRINKLES _ Finally, make sure there are a few surprises
in the game plan for your opponent. Denver's defense allowed only
one touchdown because it surprised the Falcons with a variety of
new blitzes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every way, Mike had us more prepared than the Falcons
were,'' said running back Terrell Davis. ``It's that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Draft Challenges the Browns
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Browns are going into the off season with two
goals: draft a quarterback, probably Kentucky's Tim Couch or
Oregon's Akili Smith, and avoid selecting too many stiffs or
outcasts on the list for Tuesday's expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the 30 existing teams had to put five players on the
list and expect to lose no more than two. If the Browns were to
select a team's player, the team could pull two players back.
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League wanted to make sure the Browns did
not spend all or most of their salary cap money plucking talented
veteran free agents from other teams. If the Browns had no
restraints, and they wanted Giant defensive end Michael Strahan _
an unrestricted free agent and perhaps one of the top five young
players in the game _ the Giants would have no chance at keeping
him because the Browns would easily be able to outbid them. So the
league mandated that Cleveland use at least 38 percent of its cap
on the expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for the Browns is walking the minefield of the
draft list. For every decent player, there are 10 with high
salaries and bad attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Marino Seeks 3 or 4 More Seasons
</P>
<P>
   Dan Marino is talking about playing three or four more seasons
and could sign an extension with the Miami Dolphins in the coming
weeks ... Some teams are taking a hard look at Jeff Lewis, a free
agent who was the Broncos' third-string quarterback. There is
speculation that the Giants are one of those teams. Meanwhile, the
Giants have made no official decision on who their quarterback will
be next season, and probably will not until after the college draft
... The Minnesota Vikings continue to listen to offers for
quarterback Brad Johnson, and their asking price is high. They
wanted a No. 1 pick and defensive end Michael Sinclair from
Seattle. The Seahawks said no thanks; Sinclair led the league in
sacks last year.

FAT CAT, AS DEFINED BY THE NBA  
 OLDIES BUT GOODIES  
 MAKING PEACE WITH NBC  
 REJECTING RODMAN  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a term for enjoying life as a wealthy and carefree
National Basketball Association player. It is called living large.
You can afford to drive expensive cars, wear the best fabrics and
eat at the finest and, well, fattiest restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   It is that last pleasure Shawn Kemp, Bryant Reeves and several
other players took to the extreme. They not only lived large during
the six-month lockout, they showed up large to training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really shocking,'' said the Hall of Fame guard Walt
Frazier. ``I'm surprised, because sooner or later they had to know
that they were going to have to go back to work. They should be
embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, eight months off, and you're still out of shape?'' he
added. ``The league should be worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves ate so much over the extended break, he lost his starting
job with the Vancouver Grizzlies to the journeyman forward Tony
Massenburg. Arriving 40 pounds heavier than last season, Reeves has
shed about 15 pounds in two weeks. But he still needs to drop
another 25 pounds to return to his playing weight. Currently,
Reeves tips the scales at about 315.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be a point of embarrassment,'' said Reeves when asked
whether he was worried about his weight gain having a lasting
impact on his career. ``I don't know, I haven't been faced with
that yet. We'll wait until that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Kemp, who says he was only a few pounds overweight, showed up in
Cleveland with a waistline that resembled his nearly 40-inch,
vertical leap. He, too, has shed pounds in the past few weeks. But
Kemp's getting into shape during the season may take a toll on his
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I think Shawn would be the first to admit that he came
in with a couple of extra pounds as did other players in other
situations,'' said Cleveland Coach Mike Fratello. ``I would like to
see the players come back and understand, you know, nine months is
different than coming back two or three weeks late.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I think happened to some of the guys who may have put
some extra pounds on is that they, one, may have bought into the
idea that this thing honestly wasn't going to get back together
again,'' Fratello said. ``Two, they got away from their workout
regime for the first month or two of the off season. Some of us
have that great ability to put pounds on more quickly than
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Kemp and Reeves were not alone. If it was not Dennis Scott and
Patrick Ewing in New York, it was Scott Burrell in New Jersey or
Oliver Miller in Toronto saying he needed to drop 10 to 15 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, when I see a player have an outstanding season, 9 out
of 10 times his contract is up,'' Frazier said. ``They get up for
the contract. After that, they don't seem to care.''

   Kemp signed a deal worth more than $100 million with the
Cavaliers in the summer of 1997 and Reeves' six-year, $66 million
extension kicks in with the Grizzlies this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Greg Ostertag, it was the same thing,'' Frazier said. ``A
lot of people were afraid to sign Ike Austin for the same reasons.
I look at Kemp, and he is so out of shape, he's obviously not ready
to carry the load for them. You're going to see a lot of hamstring
pulls early.''

   Glenn (Doc) Rivers, who retired from the NBA two seasons ago
with a chronic back condition, keeps watching the daily
transactions and shakes his head in disbelief. Players older than
his 37 years keep re-appearing on rosters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the Jazz pick up Thurl Bailey, and I said to myself,
`Huh?,''' said Rivers, now a TNT basketball analyst. ``I thought it
was a misprint. I figured they had gone and got Pearl Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Might as well.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Dominique Wilkins, 39, signed on in Orlando for two
seasons. Also off the Magic bench: the 39-year-old Danny Schayes.
Herb Williams, who turns 41 on Feb. 16, still has a year left with
the Knicks. The 37-year-old Antoine Carr got a one-year deal in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   As the proliferation of teen-agers in the NBA grows, more and
more teams are also going to the NBA attic to dust off relics and
give them uniforms, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's desperation, but 10 years ago a
22-year-old was a rookie in the league,'' said Rivers. ``That guy,
in some cases, is now a four-year veteran. Experience means so
much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, a lot of guys are in much better condition because of
strength coaches and dieting. It used to be a when a guy reached 30
or 31, you worried about him going downhill. Twenty-eight was your
prime. Now, guys are playing well at 36 and 37.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the average age of Karl Malone, John Stockton and Jeff
Hornacek is 36.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has nothing to do with athleticism and everything to do
with knowing the game,'' Rivers added. ``For a lot guys, though,
once you finally get that experience, you're too old to do anything
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Making Peace With NBC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing, who said during the lockout that NBC's role in
the labor dispute would not be forgotten, appears to have mended
fences with the network.
</P>
<P>
   The union president and several players had threatened to
boycott interviews with NBC, blaming the network for agreeing to a
deal with the NBA that ensured that the owners would receive their
rights fees for telecasts _ even if games were not played.
</P>
<P>
   But in a conversation with Dick Ebersol, the NBC Sports
president, the strained relations were put to rest. On the night
the deal was agreed to in principle, Commissioner David Stern and
Billy Hunter, the union executive director, also agreed that the
players would cooperate with the networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NBC thing ended with the lockout,'' Ewing said. ``That's
all over with. We're moving on now.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rejecting Rodman &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Rodman has still not made a decision, fueling speculation
that the irascible rebounder will not choose a team until the
season is at least a few weeks old. Potential suitors like Miami
and Orlando have been backing out over the past week, especially
given Rodman's requests for preferred treatment (i.e. he does not
want to practice). Pat Riley seemed keen on taking in the wayward,
37-year-old forward, but backed off after Rodman was quoted as
saying, ``Not even Riles can deal with my demons.'' ... The present
and future of German basketball met Friday night in Dallas when
Detlef Schrempf's SuperSonics outlasted Dirk Nowitzki and the
Mavericks. Actually, Nowitzki, the 6-9 rookie, scored only two
points in 16 minutes of a 92-86 overtime loss. Schrempf scored
nine. The game was attended by a phalanx of German basketball
officials, who are trying to repair a strained relationship with
Schrempf. Nowitzki is seen as a key to the country's Olympic hopes
over the next decade.

INCENTIVES HELP BASS IN TOP MEXICAN LAKE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By KEN SCHULTZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINALOA, Mexico _ The rising sun was a welcome sight for Katie
Watson and me. We were sitting on our cold and nearly numb hands as
our guide, Tony Balboa, slowed his boat and shut off the motor. We
had already been fishing for largemouth bass for an hour on this
unusually cool morning and I was about to dip my fingers into El
Salto Lake to warm them up. The water on this 15-year-old Mexican
impoundment was warmer than the air, and the thick mist rising off
the surface was beginning to thin here in a back channel.
</P>
<P>
   A frequent visitor to this mountain-fringed lake in western
Mexico, Katie said there was a cemetery up ahead, inundated when
the lake was flooded. Shortly, we pulled within casting range of a
tombstone and Tony motioned us to cast our surface plugs toward it.
The upper 10 inches of a lone tombstone were above the surface, and
I must have looked a little wide-eyed at it because the
English-speaking Mexican guide laughed and said, ``Try to catch a
live one.''
</P>
<P>
   Katie cast a silver-and-black popper to the right side of the
stone, let it lie still for a moment, then softly twitched it. Both
the calm water and the morning quiet were shattered when a big bass
attacked it, leaving a bathtub-sized swirl where Katie's popper had
been. She let out a yell, but had no chance to set the hook; the
bass bolted forward and expelled the hard-plastic lure. Perhaps it
was a coincidence that the sun crested the treetops at that moment
and the mist disappeared, but we were both instantly warmed up.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of big ``live ones'' here currently has anglers'
blood and the adrenaline flowing. Katie's fish could well have been
a kin to the 11-pound bass that a Dallas fisherman caught on the
same lure at dusk the previous evening. And that topped off a day
in which he had also caught and released a 10-pounder and his wife
an 8-pounder.
</P>
<P>
   This is down-and-dirty bass-fishing, however, and catching
largemouths of such enviable sizes is commendable since the lake is
full of flooded timber, and the bass _ as fast and broad-shouldered
as National Football League linebackers _ are virtually guaranteed
to streak into a submerged cactus or mesquite tree as soon as they
are hooked. Many anglers have lost the biggest bass of their lives
at El Salto when their line proved no match for jalapeno-hot fish
and wooden underwater booby traps.
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't just big bass that are drawing anglers from the
United States, Canada, Europe and Japan. Nestled in the mountains
about an hour-and-a half drive from Mazatlan, this 24,000-acre lake
is being fished by one of the top outfitters in the adventure
fishing travel business, Billy Chapman Jr.
</P>
<P>
   A former New Jerseyan whose customers have followed him to the
best waters of several countries, Chapman is putting roots down
here. He has already constructed the deluxe Angler's Inn fishing
lodge (www.AnglersInn.com) and is starting a small retirement
community, a coastal roosterfish and snook-angling business, a
dove-hunting operation, bird-watching tours.
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps most importantly, Chapman is expanding a
humanitarian program for the people living in the mountain villages
who were displaced by the creation of the lake.
</P>
<P>
   That program, Clothes for Bass, is only two years old, but in
1998 it dispensed 16,000 pounds of clothing to more than 300 people
here. Formerly farmers, the residents are now commercial fishermen,
netting El Salto for tilapia, a food fish transplanted to Mexico
from its native Africa many decades ago. Tilapia repopulate quickly
and need to be harvested at El Salto, but the temptation exists to
also take the bass, which fetch a good price on the underground
market. Commercial netting and selling of bass is illegal, but
continues at other lakes, adversely affecting bass populations.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman's program for recreational anglers will help sustain the
bass, which attract dozens of anglers weekly; all of the bass they
catch are released alive. It also gives something tangible back to
the local people. ``One 10-pound bass will bring $3,'' said
Chapman, ``but a full complement of clothes for a family are worth
$1,500. So if they sign an agreement with me not to take the bass,
and stick to the tilapia, we'll give them plenty of clothes, plus
medical supplies, toys and other things they can't afford.'' The
average commercial tilapia fisherman earns $6,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman has mostly relied on a large client list to donate the
clothes and supplies (Clothes for Bass, 14842 Maple Drive,
Kellyville, Okla. 74039). Last year nearly 400 people contributed
more than 25 pounds of clothes apiece. He put the contributors'
names into a drawing and picked one for a free four-day
bass-fishing trip to El Salto.
</P>
<P>
   Bass are present in El Salto only because the lake was stocked
with 200,000 Florida-strain bass in 1985, when it was filling.
These fish, which have formed the cornerstone of much-heralded
trophy bass-stocking programs in California and Texas, are noted
for growing fast and achieving huge (10-to 20-pound) size. In
December, El Salto produced a lake-record 14-pound-3-ounce bass for
one of Chapman's customers, and 20-pounders may be possible. If so,
that would put El Salto on a short list of the world's best
big-bass lakes. In 1994, a 16-pound-3-ounce bass was found dead in
El Salto; it had choked to death with a tilapia wedged in its
throat.
</P>
<P>
   Katie and I caught no huge bass, but there will be more days to
come, as well as warmer temperatures. Perhaps we spent too much
time gawking at a potpourri of bird life, including the first
falcon I have ever seen in the wild. The waterfowl is especially
abundant at El Salto, particularly ospreys, herons, ibises and
egrets, which obviously find the fishing to their liking as well.

<P>
   LONDON _ In 1386 _ which was a long, long time ago _ one Michael
de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk, confronted a destiny in medieval
England that resonates to this day.
</P>
<P>
   He was impeached.
</P>
<P>
   And there began a long and tangled process of legal challenge to
executive authority by representative body that, somewhat
circuitously, brought William Jefferson Clinton to trial on the
floor of the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Earl of Suffolk, let it be said, was not impeached on
accusations related to sexual dalliance, so far as is known. His
crimes related more to misusing public funds and other offenses.
</P>
<P>
   But he was, like President Clinton, accused of ``high crimes and
misdemeanors'' _ the first appearance of that vague and contentious
phrase in the canon of English law. The words provided a starting
point for the Framers of the U.S. Constitution almost four
centuries later, according to Professor Gary McDowell, an American
expert on impeachment at the Institute of United States Studies at
London University.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt,'' McDowell said in congressional testimony
as the impeachment proceedings got under way in Washington in
November, ``that when the Americans turned their attention to
fashioning procedures for impeachment, they had the history of
Great Britain in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, the British lessons serve as much as a warning of
impeachment's abuses as a guide to its benefits. ``History shows us
that in England, impeachment has been an engine more of passion
than of justice,'' he quoted Thomas Jefferson as saying.
</P>
<P>
   It is, possibly, one of the abiding ironies that the Framers of
the Constitution transplanted the notion of impeachment from an old
monarchy to a new republic just as the British themselves were
abandoning it. The Constitutional Convention began its
deliberations in Philadelphia in 1787. The last major impeachment
in British history began in 1788, when Warren Hastings, the first
governor-general of India, was charged with ``maladministration,
corruption in office and cruelty towards the people of India,''
according to McDowell. (His trial lasted seven years and he was
acquitted.)
</P>
<P>
   The reason impeachment withered in Britain was simply that the
growing strength of Parliament and the waning of despotic
monarchial rule allowed legislators to remove ministers through
confidence votes. ``As soon as the British system evolved into a
parliamentary system,'' said Professor Bernard Capp, a historian at
Warwick University, ``impeachment fell away.''
</P>
<P>
   So what remained from Britain's tradition in the new American
model of impeachment? Capp said impeachment in Britain had largely
been used as ``a means of attacking unpopular ministers'' put into
office by the king _ especially in the 17th century.
</P>
<P>
   Raoul Berger, a leading authority, wrote in his study,
``Impeachment: The Constitutional Problems'' (Harvard University
Press, 1974), ``Direct attack on the king being unthinkable save by
the path that led Charles I to the block, Parliament indulged in
the fiction that the king could do no wrong but was misled by its
ministers.''
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment gave Parliament a means to establish supremacy over
``absolutist pretensions,'' Berger wrote, and hence to erode the
power of the monarchy on the way to democracy. As in the United
States today, it thus represented a weapon in the perennial battle
between executive and legislative branches of government, an arrow
from a quiver of checks and balances supposed to hold democracy in
equilibrium and protect it from abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Historians say British tradition is the source of the process by
which the lower legislative house levels the charges to be tried by
the upper house (in Britain's case, it was the House of Commons and
House of Lords, respectively).
</P>
<P>
   And just as in the United States, impeachment in Britain was
long used for the removal of judges _ like Chief Justice William
Scroggs, impeached in 1680 on charges including excessive drinking
and bringing ``the highest scandal on the public justice of the
kingdom'' through irresponsible rulings.
</P>
<P>
   It was the British practice that enshrined the notion of ``high
crimes and misdemeanors'' as going beyond common law to a broader
sense of the betrayal of public trust.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the British system worked on a definition similar
to that provided by former President Gerald R. Ford when, as a
congressman in 1970, he said that ``an impeachable offense is
whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to
be at a given moment in history.''
</P>
<P>
   The Duke of Buckingham, for instance, was impeached in 1626 on
charges that included procuring ``titles of honor to his mother,
brothers and kindred,'' according to Berger's study.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Pett, the commissioner of the navy, was impeached in 1668
for ``negligent preparation for the Dutch invasion'' and ``loss of
a ship through neglect to bring it to mooring.''
</P>
<P>
   The Earl of Oxford, Viscount Bolingbroke and the Earl of
Strafford were impeached in 1715 for giving ``pernicious advice''
to the Crown regarding the terms of the Peace of Utrecht, ending
the War of the Spanish Succession.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably the prescribed punishment is the biggest difference
between the British and American impeachment procedures.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, removal from office is the sole penalty.
But in Britain, possible penalties once included ``corruption of
the blood,'' meaning the disinheritance of the offender's
descendants, said James McClellan, a retired professor of political
science and law in Indianapolis. Sentence could be meted out
through a ``bill of attainder,'' a legislative act allowing
punishment without trial. Treason, according to most authorities,
was punishable by death.
</P>
<P>
   Surveying the charges against him, Clinton might also draw
comfort from other turns of history.
</P>
<P>
   Sir William Blackstone, the principal British legal authority
available to the Framers, identified the obstruction of justice as
``at all times an offense of a very high and presumptuous nature.''
Perjury, he said, was a ``detestable'' offense, ``punished with six
months' imprisonment, perpetual infamy, and a fine, or to have both
ears nailed to the pillory.''

leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, and the minority leader, Tom
Daschle of South Dakota, managed to forge a better relationship

programs, it is now the government that cannot be trusted and a

TEXAS OFFICIAL SAYS PRISONS MEET JUDGE'S REQUIREMENTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A day after Texas penitentiaries were described
as among the nation's most horrific, a state official testified
Friday that the prison system fully complies with a 1992 federal
court order governing mental-health care for inmates.
</P>
<P>
   And two Texas prison units have passed a national group's
inspection with flying colors, becoming the first in the state to
win prestigious accreditation of the American Correctional
Association, an inspector said.
</P>
<P>
   The upbeat testimony before senior U.S. District Judge William
Wayne Justice was aimed at offsetting the claims of inmates and
their hired experts that Texas prisons fail to properly treat
mentally-ill prisoners and routinely violate their civil rights
with a variety of unconstitutional prison conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Suzanne Ducate, director of mental health services for the
University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, which provides
medical care to inmates, said the state meets Justice's 1992
requirements. The official said Texas gives inmates full access to
mental-health care; enforces work limitations for ailing inmates;
and won accreditation for all three mental-health units from the
National Council for Correctional Health Care.
</P>
<P>
   Ducate said the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, which also
contracts with the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center for
medical services, has developed sufficient policies and procedures
to assure high-quality care for the state's 140,000 inmates. She
said there's also an intense effort to find qualified health-care
personnel and train security officers to identify mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   Ducate said the state's conversion in 1994-96 to a managed care
system for inmates has produced ``a greater emphasis on wellness,''
with patients being treated as early as possible for their
ailments. And while she acknowledged that the high cost of
medication is an ever-present concern, the psychiatrist said the
state does make use of cutting edge anti-psychotic drugs and also
is in the forefront of tele-psychiatry _ which uses closed-circuit
televisions to link far-flung inmates and prison doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel as if you're in the same room as the patient,'' said
Ducate, who from her home can treat inmates more than 500 miles
away in Fort Stockton.
</P>
<P>
   The official said an elaborate system of checks and balances is
in place to assure proper treatment, though problems persist. One
female inmate recently died as a result of improper psychiatric
care, and scrutiny of the treating doctor's actions led to his
firing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that the care was definitely substandard,'' Ducate
said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that one of the system's problems is inmates' refusal
to consent to transfer to prison mental-health units from regular
units. Consequently, inmates with various mental illnesses
sometimes languish in solitary-confinement cells and exhibit the
kind of bizarre behavior that inmates' experts testified about
previously.
</P>
<P>
   Justice, obviously intrigued about why inmates in solitary
confinement would smear themselves with their own feces, urinate on
their cell floors, mutilate themselves and exhibit other strange
behavior, pressed Ducate for explanations.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor said some of the actions could be signs of bonafide
mental illness, warranting their housing in mental-health units.
But she noted that other federal-court rulings guarantee inmates
the right to refuse psychiatric treatment. Furthermore, some of the
obnoxious behavior may be reasonable responses to confinement;
calculated to win attention or designed to gain a new housing
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does work in many instances,'' Ducate said, adding, ``these
are very difficult people to treat.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge, curious about the doctor's opinion on whether
long-term solitary confinement was ``conducive to mental health,''
got this reply: ``I would have to say `no.''' But Ducate added that
one of the saddest things about her job is being unable to convince
some troubled inmates to transfer from solitary confinement to
in-patient psychiatric units.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor took issue with an inmate expert's claim that
numerous solitary-confinement prisoners visited in a 1998
inspection displayed true mental illness. She said her own team's
examination of the inmates found only one in need of a transfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to insure no one is under-treated or misdiagnosed,''
Ducate emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, an Illinois-based consultant who conducts
inspections for the American Correctional Association said he was
pleasantly surprised by the conditions he saw in the Eastham and
Robertson units, which won accreditation last month. He admitted he
wasn't anxious to visit the units because he had heard from other
professionals that Texas prisons had ``significant problems,'' and
that Texas officials ``actively opposed the ACA (accreditation)
process.''
</P>
<P>
   But the units scored 100 on all mandatory categories, including
use-of-force issues, and reached the 95 score required for
non-mandatory standards, the inspector said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I left Robertson (near Abilene), I was very pleased with
what I saw,'' said consultant David Sandahl. ``I was equally
impressed at Eastham (near Lovelady) because that's an old joint.''
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning by inmates' lawyers, however, Sandahl conceded
that the three-day inspections were in some ways superficial and
dependent on case files offered by prison officials. Justice, too,
suggested that such an inspection could be like those in the
military, when everyone knows it's coming and have time to prepare
for it.
</P>
<P>
   But Sandahl said that doesn't make the inspections meaningless.
He said they help officials set goals, pull staff together, and in
Texas' case, caused some inmates to say they hoped other units will
seek accreditation because of the changes the process prompted.
</P>
<P>
   Justice plans to take testimony on behalf of inmates and the
state through next week before deciding whether to retain his
oversight over the prison system. Attorney General John Cornyn is
pressing for him to relinquish the case, citing prison officials'
claims that they meet Justice's voluminous requirements.

OLY-SAMARANCH-SHORT-VERSION) 
(JT) 
 By ROGER COHEN with JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BARCELONA, Spain _ The man who steered the Olympic Games from
financial ruin to huge prosperity over the past 18 years is a
mild-mannered Spaniard whose unchanging attire _ blue suit, blue
shirt, blue tie _ amounts to the uniform of somebody who prefers to
pass unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   But here in his hometown, Juan Antonio Samaranch keeps a
basement office that tells of a man welcomed with deferential
tribute. The octagonal room has the untouched air of a mausoleum
filled with offerings: a silver cup with chrysanthemum crest
presented by the emperor of Japan, an oil painting of Samaranch
from Russia, and, in the entrance, a woven tapestry-portrait
presented by a Kuwaiti sheik.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch earns no salary in his job as president of the
International Olympic Committee, but travels the world like a head
of state. All of his expenses outside Spain _ a modest suite at the
Palace hotel in Lausanne, Switzerland; food, first-class air travel
and so on _ are paid by the Olympic movement or countries hoping to
become host to the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept suites,'' he said of the lavish accommodations
offered by Olympic hopefuls. ``I need a living room.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how much his lifestyle costs the IOC annually, Samaranch
said in an interview: ``I don't know. Hundreds of thousands of
dollars, maybe, millions no. I fly first-class. It's normal. I am
78 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past two months, with the Olympic movement battered by
allegations of corruption at Salt Lake City and elsewhere,
Samaranch has sought to bridge the gap between his retiring
personality and insistent images of uncontrolled indulgence. For
his supporters, he remains a servant of sport who transformed the
Olympics from financial ruin to unimagined prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   But an examination of Samaranch's life, based on interviews in
Europe, Asia and North America, suggests that at the least he had
no enthusiasm for uncovering wrongdoing in the Olympic movement and
may have encouraged it through his own example as he pursued his
consuming goal of broadening and enriching the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Samaranch was not without sufficient information from us and
others to conduct a serious investigation a long time ago,'' said
Norm Seagram, an organizer of the failed Toronto bid for the 1996
Olympics and co-author of a 1991 report to the IOC suggesting that
abuses by IOC members cost the city up to $800,0000. ``But his
response was superficial.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Samaranch dismissed such charges. ``I am
wounded because it is disagreeable to be accused of false things,''
he said. ``We always tried to look into rumors of bad conduct _ but
they were just that, rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   His lips trembled slightly. A proud man, an embattled man, he
was seated in a second Barcelona office, this one on the 23rd floor
of ``La Caixa,'' Spain's biggest savings bank, of which he is
honorary chairman. A room with a sweeping view of the hometown he
transformed by steering the 1992 Olympics here. The bank pays his
expenses when he is here.
</P>
<P>
   Those Summer Games in Barcelona were widely regarded as a
triumph, a reflection of Samaranch's extraordinary transformation
of the Olympics from an event that scarcely anyone wanted to a
coveted money spinner.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that Samaranch ever sought personal
enrichment from this booming Olympics-related business. But more
money slowly brought demands _ for controls and transparency _ that
were unfamiliar to him. IOC members appear to have felt little or
no pressure from their president to resist seductive blandishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mistakes? I don't know about mistakes,'' Samaranch said. ``We
explained clearly what the rules were, we heard some rumors, we
tried to reduce the number of people in the selection process for
Olympic cities, but we could not. Naturally members are attached to
their privileges.''
</P>
<P>
   He has his defenders. Marc Hodler, the veteran Swiss IOC member
and lawyer whose public comments on corruption helped ignite the
current scandal, called Samaranch a ``great president'' who
``achieved unique things by understanding the commercial potential
of the Games.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe so much to him,'' said Anita DeFrantz, the American
vice president of the IOC. ``Women are now members of the IOC. More
women compete in the Olympics. He should be allowed to complete his
job by cleaning things up.''
</P>
<P>
   But a cleanup under public scrutiny is a new notion for
Samaranch. As a government functionary in the the Spain of General
Francisco Franco and as president of the IOC, the Lausanne-based
society that is the ``supreme authority'' of the Olympic Games,
Samaranch has had scant exposure to the strictures of public
accountability. It appears now that this career path may have left
him out of phase with his times.
</P>
<P>
   This was strikingly underscored at an international doping
conference in Lausanne last week, when Samaranch proposed that he
should lead a new global effort to combat athlete drug use. The
suggestion was soundly rejected by European and American
representatives, who seemed stunned that Samaranch had failed to
grasp the precipitous drop in the IOC's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a failure of leadership, unquestionably,'' said
Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the White House drug czar, who attended the
conference. ``The IOC members are merely trustees of the world's
athletes. We want to see democracy, open votes, open meetings, open
books.''
</P>
<P>
   Otto Schily, the German interior minister, was blunter: ``One
should know when to retire from an office,'' he said of Samaranch.
``If one reigns like a constitutional monarch, that is not helpful
for sport.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Tact and Tenacity, With Calculation
</P>
<P>
   But Samaranch said he is determined to fight back. Although
several IOC colleagues have speculated that he might step down
later this year, Samaranch said that his plan is clear: Use an
Olympic committee session next month to shore up his position with
a vote of confidence, reform the organization, and retire in 2001
with his record salvaged.
</P>
<P>
   It is a bold strategy, but Samaranch has been underestimated
before.
</P>
<P>
   Of middling build and modest manner, courteous, attentive to
detail, fanatical about physical fitness, Samaranch quietly builds
bridges and loyalty, edging toward well-defined ambitions with a
mixture of tact and tenacity.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Samaranch has achieved what he sets out to do. Jose
Maria Sumpsi, a longtime friend of the IOC president, showed a
design conceived by Samaranch in the 1960s that featured the shield
of the provincial government of Barcelona above the five-ringed
Olympic symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was done years before Samaranch was president of either
body,'' Sumpsi said, ``but he already knew clearly what he wanted;
then he went for it. In 1973, he became the president of the
Barcelona provincial government. Seven years later, he was
president of the IOC. The vision on this design came true.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for nothing, it seems. Consider Samaranch on the subject of
diplomacy, an art he formally practiced for just three years, as
Spain's ambassador to Moscow between 1977 and 1980:
</P>
<P>
   Know how to listen. Never speak in a language not your own (an
interpreter provides time to think). Convey credibility. Have a
clear objective. Understand that you may not reach your aim in a
straight line. So be ready, when necessary, ``to employ a few
curves.''
</P>
<P>
   These ``curves'' _ roundabout routes to a given target _ have
been a consistent feature of Samaranch's life.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a self-made Barcelona textile baron and a one-time
sportswriter who used the pen name Stick, Samaranch was born to
considerable wealth in 1920. He emerged in the late 1940s as a
passionate sportsman with a particular interest in roller-hockey (a
sort of poor man's ice hockey), and an eye for political
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Dapper, gallant, he earned a reputation as a lady's man of
unfailing solicitude (birthdays duly noted, bouquets always on
time). His wealth was cemented and standing enhanced with his
marriage in 1955 to a Barcelona society beauty, Maria Teresa
Salisachs, whose family money was older than his own.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time he rose steadily in the ranks of Gen. Franco's
Fascist administration, becoming the rough equivalent of a junior
under-secretary of sport and gaining the prestige that allowed him
to join the IOC in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not ashamed of what I did in Spain,'' Samaranch said.
``Franco did good things for my country. He kept us out of World
War II. He created a middle class. He chose a good successor, the
king.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch smoothly navigated Spain's transition from autocratic
to democratic rule after Franco's death in 1975. ``He adapts to
everything,'' said Ernest Lluch, a former Spanish health minister
who knows Samaranch. ``In fact, he is one of the great
chameleons.''
</P>
<P>
   Just two years after Franco's death, Samaranch was named Spain's
first ambassador to Moscow. Already a vice president of the IOC,
Samaranch had a clear aim in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years after joining the IOC in 1966, I had started
thinking about being president,'' he recalled. ``Moscow was
preparing the Olympics of 1980, and I knew that going there would
be a good move for my ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   As it was. When Lord Killanin of Ireland stepped down in 1980,
Samaranch was elected with an absolute majority of 47 votes in the
first round. Hispanic and Soviet-bloc votes helped do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Many, however, saw the presidency as a poisoned chalice.
``Everybody was writing the Olympic obituary,'' said Michael Payne,
a British IOC member who oversees marketing. ``We were politically
and financially bankrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   After the African boycott of the 1976 Summer Games in Montreal,
60 Western nations, led by the United States, boycotted the 1980
Moscow Games over the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Sport seemed
a Cold War victim. The IOC had less than $500,000 in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The Art Of Mollification
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch responded with an extraordinary energy, apparently
driven by his abhorrence of conflict, his Spanish experience of
political reconciliation and his vision of an all-embracing
Olympics. Wherever he could, and by whatever means, he reached out
to extend the Olympic family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has always known how to soften people and he impregnated
the Olympics with this art,'' said Jaume Boix Angelats, the author
of a critical biography of Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   When Angelats was working on his book, the IOC president would
constantly invite him and his co-author on far-flung, expenses-paid
trips to meet him. They declined. ``He wanted us in his debt,''
Angelats said.
</P>
<P>
   Lluch, the former Spanish health minister, produced a Longines
watch given to him by the IOC president after a presentation in
Lausanne of the hospital facilities for Barcelona. ``He just came
up to me and said, `Have a little souvenir.' Funny.''
</P>
<P>
   But whatever its quirks, Samaranch's diplomacy, based on endless
travel, worked. After the Soviet boycott of the Los Angeles Games,
he coaxed 160 of 167 countries then in the Olympic movement to
attend the 1988 Olympics in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first years of his reign, he made more positive,
uplifting changes than all the other IOC presidents put together,''
said John Lucas, an Olympic historian. Among them were rescuing the
Games financially, opening opportunities for women, enabling more
developing nations to compete and bringing professional athletes
into the Games.
</P>
<P>
   But the restless expansion had a price. Olympic awards were
showered on the likes of the East German dictator Erich Honecker
with a view to luring his country to the 1988 Seoul Olympics after
the 1984 boycott, even though he was widely rumored _ and later
discovered _ to be running a state-sponsored doping system.
</P>
<P>
   New IOC members poured in _ more than 80 percent of the current
membership joined under Samaranch. Their credentials were not
always spotless. Maj. Gen. Francis Nyangweso of Uganda became a
member in 1988. He was a former Olympic boxer; he was also an army
commander during Idi Amin's campaign of torture and terror.
</P>
<P>
   An Australian Olympic official has said he paid Nyangweso
$35,000 the night before Sydney won the 2000 Summer Games, beating
Beijing by two votes. The general has denied using the money for
personal use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who do you find in Uganda?'' asked Franklin Servan-Schreiber,
an IOC spokesman. ``Do you want to push for human rights around the
world? That's Amnesty International. Or do you want African
athletes at the Olympic Games?''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch wanted African athletes. In 1986, he brought in
Jean-Paul Ganga of the Congo Republic, a leader of the 1976 African
boycott of the Montreal Games and a strong anti-apartheid
campaigner.
</P>
<P>
   The move was prescient: when apartheid collapsed, Ganga helped
steer South Africa back to the 1992 Olympics. But Ganga has since
been accused by the IOC of taking more than $216,000 in illicit
benefits from Salt Lake City. He has denied that his vote on the
2002 site selection was for sale and has said he will protest his
expulsion from the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Samaranch wants to sacrifice his friends,'' Ganga said in an
interview. ``That is dangerous for him. It is war now.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Samaranch appears to have failed is in not perceiving that
making the Olympics bigger _ his unswerving goal _ required
balancing with tighter controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cost-effectiveness and Internet-style openness are concepts
foreign to him,'' said Alberto Montagut, an editor of the Catalan
edition of the newspaper El Mundo. ``Resignation does not exist in
his culture, because it is the act of an accountable type of
management.''

</P>
<P>
   Pools of Money, Yet No Reckoning
</P>
<P>
   For years, management was not much of an issue for the Olympic
movement: there was almost no money to manage.
</P>
<P>
   When Hodler, the Swiss IOC member, joined in the early 1960s, he
recalled that the only revenue was the 40 Swiss francs ($29) paid
each year by members _ providing overall annual revenue of about
$300.
</P>
<P>
   Under Samaranch, however, the quaint poverty of aristocrats and
gentlemen gave way to the rigorously commercialized wealth of
managers of the lucrative five-ringed Olympic brand.
</P>
<P>
   After Peter Ueberroth demonstrated at Los Angeles in 1984 that
clever marketing could make the Olympics profitable, IOC income
from sales of television rights, exclusive corporate sponsorships,
licensing agreements and tickets soared. Worldwide television and
sponsorship rights are now worth $3.5 billion for the 1997-2000
period alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We changed the Olympic movement,'' Samaranch said. ``We made
it universal. We gave it the means to help people. We held one
Olympics after another that was a triumph.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, a lot of people _ many of them poor _ benefited. The
IOC set up a program called Olympic Solidarity in 1961 to promote
the movement by building sports facilities and providing athletic
scholarships around the world. For a long time it had little money.
Now, for the 1997-2000 period, it has $122 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the pools of money created an anachronism at IOC
headquarters in Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly a nongovernmental, nonprofit, private association of
unsalaried men and women _ voting in secret, choosing new members
by co-option, publishing no overall accounts _ was responsible for
hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenue and for choosing
the site of Olympic Games worth fortunes to the cities elected.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic Charter states: ``The Olympic Games are the
exclusive property of the IOC which owns all rights relating
thereto.'' These rights were a gold mine in a world where sport
bred passions once reserved for religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not a corporation,'' Hodler argued. ``We are a club of
friends. And we never had the two-thirds majority necessary to
change the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pound, an IOC vice president from Montreal and the
lawyer who handles television rights sales in the Americas,
conceded that there was still ``very little financial
transparency'' and ``we could do a better job.''
</P>
<P>
   It is by no means clear, however, that Samaranch ever had any
real enthusiasm for steps that might bring that transparency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world of sport changed a lot in recent years,'' he
acknowledged. ``Maybe our mistake was not to change the IOC
statutes. I tried.''
</P>
<P>
   The Samaranch Limited: $7,000 Per Trip
</P>
<P>
   Although he does not vote on the selection of Olympic cities,
contestants for the bids clearly thought it was worthwhile to court
Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   The Nagano Olympic committee laid on a private three-car train
for him in 1991 with a view to winning _ as it did _ the 1998
Winter Games. The train, run by JR East, Japan's largest railroad
company, cost about $7,000 to hire for the trip from a site near
Tokyo to Nagano, a spokesman for JR said.
</P>
<P>
   When in Nagano for the Games, Samaranch was put up at the
Imperial suite of the Kokusai 21 Hotel from Jan 28, 1998 to
February 23, 1998, at a cost of close to $3,000 per night _ or over
$75,0000, a Nagano committee official said. He also received a
Japanese sword and a painting, each valued at about $16,000, Nagano
city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch took the occasion to decorate Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, a
secretive billionaire Japanese businessman with whom he enjoys what
the Tokyo Shimbun describes as a ``honeymoon relationship,'' with
the ``gold Olympic order.''
</P>
<P>
   Tsutsumi had led the battle to bring the Olympics to Nagano _ a
multimillion-dollar campaign whose details have been hidden by the
burning of Nagano's Olympic accounts. He also contributed
substantially to one of Samaranch's pet projects _ the Olympic
museum in Lausanne, opened in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In South Korea, which he has visited more than 25 times since
becoming president, Samaranch has enjoyed another intimate
relationship with a millionaire businessman, Kim Un Yong.
</P>
<P>
   A former bodyguard of the late dictator Park Chung Hee, Kim made
a fortune on land deals south of Seoul's Han river. He went on to
found the World Federation of Tae Kwon Do (Korean karate), before
being elected to the IOC in 1988, the year of the Seoul Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Kim was on the executive committee that chose
the first recipient of the Seoul international peace prize, worth
$300,000. The prize went to Samaranch. Subsequent winners got less:
the prize is worth $20,000 today.
</P>
<P>
   When in Seoul, Samaranch has regularly been housed in the
Presidential suite of the Shilla Hotel (current rate: about $1,700
a night), owned by the Samsung group, whose chairman, Lee Kun Hee,
was elected to the IOC in 1996 after making contributions to the
Olympic movement, Korean officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about these activities, Samaranch said he did not ask for
the train in Japan. And he said he immediately donated all gifts to
the IOC Samaranch did not specifically address the question of the
Samurai sword from Nagano. But an IOC statement said: ``The IOC has
absolutely no record and no recollection of the Samurai sword.''
</P>
<P>
   The $300,000 Seoul prize was given to the Olympic museum,
Samaranch said. He said the generous Asian treatment of him was
acceptable because he does not vote in the selection of Olympic
cities.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems clear that Samaranch's lifestyle provided little
incentive to restraint during the many years that he and other IOC
members say they were trying to instill a new cost-conscious
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never any serious attempt at control, because this
amounts to a secret society where all members pledge to support
each other.'' said Robert Helmick, an American former IOC member
who resigned in 1991 amid allegations of conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch dismissed such allegations, saying ``nothing that
comes from Helmick has any value, because he had to resign.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Members' Hands Were `Not in Their Pockets'
</P>
<P>
   It is Hodler of Switzerland who, for over a decade, has led the
IOC's attempts to reform the bidding process and so curtail Olympic
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   On June 16, 1987, backed by Samaranch, he sent out a letter to
members of the IOC, to national Olympic committees and to candidate
cities, stating that ``gifts of value are not permitted'' and
admonishing IOC members to stay no more than three days in any city
bidding for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   But the letter was clearly ignored.
</P>
<P>
   When Toronto mounted its bid for the 1996 Summer Games in the
late 1980s, it found that ``26 members broke established rules
either by coming with more than one guest, arriving more than once,
or staying more than the allotted time.''
</P>
<P>
   It further found, in a report submitted in January 1991 to
Samaranch and Pound, the IOC vice president, that there was
``blatant abuse'' in travel expenses. IOC members, the report said,
were cashing in first-class tickets and failing to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   These and other practices helped inflate the cost of Toronto's
bid to $14 million. ``The attitude of the IOC members was like the
doorman with his hand half out. You can't quite say the hand is
out, but it's certainly not in his pocket,'' said Seagram.
</P>
<P>
   And what was the response from Samaranch and the IOC? Pound said
that the committee tried to take over co-ordination of travel, and
asked _ orally but not in writing _ for details on the names of
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to react,'' he said, ``But you can't just pick 26
IOC members at random and shoot them.''
</P>
<P>
   Seagram, however, said there was ``no urgency and basically no
further communication'' after the submission of the report.
Samaranch, he said, did mention over dinner the need for names, but
never followed up on this. ``We were surprised and disappointed,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC did little to enforce its rules against gifts. Samaranch
appeared concerned ``not to rock the boat,'' said Sam Ramsamy, the
IOC member from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of IOC action, things evidently went from bad to
worse. When Berlin bid for the 2000 Summer Games, it found 20 IOC
members descending on the city for stays of five or six days and
accepting gifts ranging from porcelain to gold medals at a total
cost _ for the presents alone _ of about $85,000.
</P>
<P>
   A report by Germany's Green Party on the Berlin bid, which was
based on examination of city records, found that travel
arrangements were often exorbitant. One IOC member spent over
$12,000 on his air ticket, stopping in Los Angeles, Madrid,
Tenerife and London, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Isao Ichimura, the secretary general of the Nagano bid
committee, observed how, after a helicopter flight over Nagano
sites, committee members simply walked off with the binoculars they
had been given. ``We couldn't very well say no, although we
expected them back,'' Ichimura said.
</P>
<P>
   In Spain, Leopoldo Rodes, a banker and promoter of Barcelona's
bid for the Games, invited German Rieckehoff, the IOC member from
Puerto Rico, for dinner. A collector of walking sticks, Rieckehoff,
who has since died, stopped on his way out to admire a
silver-topped stick that Rodes kept by his front door.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stick belonged to my grandfather,'' Rodes said, ``but it
was obvious he wanted it, so I gave it to him. That seemed
normal.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Salt Lake City bidding for the 2002 Games began,
the offering of gifts and outright payments _ as well as the use of
agents offering to sell blocs of votes _ had become so entrenched
as to be part of the process.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC estimates that Salt Lake spent $800,000 on 14 IOC
members, including scholarships for children, medical care and cash
payments _ acts under investigation by the United States Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not surprised _ in fact I was relieved _ when the
revelations came out,'' Hodler said. ``There had been smoke around
for years. But the fire was difficult to find.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flame and the Lucre, Side by Side
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch has now become a vociferous advocate of reform. At the
president's insistence, the Olympics acted quickly to sanction
members accused at Salt Lake City, and is pushing for a radical
change in its own structures.
</P>
<P>
   But the IOC president's most cherished project _ the Olympic
museum in Lausanne _ captures the contradictions that may make such
reform difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the museum, which is approached through a faux Greek
colonnade, a flame burns with the inscription ``The Olympic flame
brightens the world.'' Beside it is a sign pointing to the museum's
nearby ``SWATCH'' store. Even here, idealism and commercialism
nestle side by side.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, a movie on Olympic history plays all day. ``In 1980,'' a
voice says, ``Juan Antonio Samaranch was elected. This was a
turning point in Olympic history.'' This is true, of course. But
the statement squares uneasily with Samaranch's professed humility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had a fairly full life,'' he said. ``I look back and
think maybe I made a few mistakes. But I got a few things right. I
tried to be loyal to my friends and I have helped a lot of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   He took out his wallet and extracted some membership cards of
Barcelona clubs. ``I am a man of habits, you see,'' he said.
``Look, I am the third member of the Barcelona tennis club, which
now has thousands of members. I am No. 7 at the Barcelona opera
house club. And No. 88 at the Spanish automobile club.''
</P>
<P>
   So, he was asked, are you an institution? ``No,'' he said, ``I
am an old man. In general people respect me. But there are always a
few exceptions.''  &QL;

THE MANY SHADES OF SAMARANCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: A long version of this story moved as OLY-SAMARANCH) 
(JT) 
 By ROGER COHEN with JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BARCELONA, Spain _ The man who steered the Olympic Games from
financial ruin to huge prosperity over the past 18 years is a
mild-mannered Spaniard whose unchanging attire _ blue suit, blue
shirt, blue tie _ amounts to the uniform of somebody who prefers to
pass unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   But here in his hometown, Juan Antonio Samaranch keeps a
basement office that tells of a man welcomed with deferential
tribute. The octagonal room has the untouched air of a mausoleum
filled with offerings: a silver cup with chrysanthemum crest
presented by the emperor of Japan, an oil painting of Samaranch
from Russia, and, in the entrance, a woven tapestry-portrait
presented by a Kuwaiti sheik.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch earns no salary in his job as president of the
International Olympic Committee, but travels the world like a head
of state. All of his expenses outside Spain _ a modest suite at the
Palace hotel in Lausanne, Switzerland; food, first-class air travel
and so on _ are paid by the Olympic movement or countries hoping to
become host to the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept suites,'' he said of the lavish accommodations
offered by Olympic hopefuls. ``I need a living room.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how much his life style costs the IOC annually, Samaranch
said in an interview: ``I don't know. Hundreds of thousands of
dollars, maybe, millions no. I fly first-class. It's normal. I am
78 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past two months, with the Olympic movement battered by
allegations of corruption at Salt Lake City and elsewhere,
Samaranch has sought to bridge the gap between his retiring
personality and insistent images of uncontrolled indulgence. For
his supporters, he remains a servant of sport who transformed the
Olympics from financial ruin to unimagined prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   But an examination of Samaranch's life, based on interviews in
Europe, Asia and North America, suggests that at the least he had
no enthusiasm for uncovering wrongdoing in the Olympic movement and
may have encouraged it through his own example as he pursued his
consuming goal of broadening and enriching the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that Samaranch ever sought personal
enrichment from this booming Olympics-related business. But more
money slowly brought demands _ for controls and transparency _ that
were unfamiliar to him. IOC members appear to have felt little or
no pressure from their president to resist seductive blandishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mistakes? I don't know about mistakes,'' Samaranch said. ``We
explained clearly what the rules were, we heard some rumors, we
tried to reduce the number of people in the selection process for
Olympic cities, but we could not. Naturally members are attached to
their privileges.''
</P>
<P>
   He has his defenders. Marc Hodler, the veteran Swiss IOC member
and lawyer whose public comments on corruption helped ignite the
current scandal, called Samaranch a ``great president'' who
``achieved unique things by understanding the commercial potential
of the Games.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe so much to him,'' said Anita DeFrantz, the American
vice president of the IOC. ``Women are now members of the IOC. More
women compete in the Olympics. He should be allowed to complete his
job by cleaning things up.''
</P>
<P>
   Of middling build and modest manner, courteous, attentive to
detail, fanatical about physical fitness, Samaranch quietly builds
bridges and loyalty, edging toward well-defined ambitions with a
mixture of tact and tenacity.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Samaranch has achieved what he sets out to do. Jose
Maria Sumpsi, a longtime friend of the IOC president, showed a
design conceived by Samaranch in the 1960s that featured the shield
of the provincial government of Barcelona above the five-ringed
Olympic symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was done years before Samaranch was president of either
body,'' Sumpsi said, ``but he already knew clearly what he wanted;
then he went for it. In 1973, he became the president of the
Barcelona provincial government. Seven years later, he was
president of the IOC. The vision on this design came true.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for nothing, it seems. Consider Samaranch on the subject of
diplomacy, an art he formally practiced for just three years, as
Spain's ambassador to Moscow between 1977 and 1980:
</P>
<P>
   Know how to listen. Never speak in a language not your own (an
interpreter provides time to think). Convey credibility. Have a
clear objective. Understand that you may not reach your aim in a
straight line. So be ready, when necessary, ``to employ a few
curves.''
</P>
<P>
   These ``curves'' _ roundabout routes to a given target _ have
been a consistent feature of Samaranch's life.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The son of a self-made Barcelona textile baron and a one-time
sportswriter who used the pen name Stick, Samaranch was born to
considerable wealth in 1920. He emerged in the late 1940s as a
passionate sportsman with a particular interest in roller-hockey (a
sort of poor man's ice hockey), and an eye for political
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Dapper, gallant, he earned a reputation as a lady's man of
unfailing solicitude (birthdays duly noted, bouquets always on
time). His wealth was cemented and standing enhanced with his
marriage in 1955 to a Barcelona society beauty, Maria Teresa
Salisachs, whose family money was older than his own.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time he rose steadily in the ranks of Gen. Franco's
Fascist administration, becoming the rough equivalent of a junior
under-secretary of sport and gaining the prestige that allowed him
to join the IOC in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not ashamed of what I did in Spain,'' Samaranch said.
``Franco did good things for my country. He kept us out of World
War II. He created a middle class. He chose a good successor, the
king.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch smoothly navigated Spain's transition from autocratic
to democratic rule after Franco's death in 1975. ``He adapts to
everything,'' said Ernest Lluch, a former Spanish health minister
who knows Samaranch. ``In fact, he is one of the great
chameleons.''
</P>
<P>
   Just two years after Franco's death, Samaranch was named Spain's
first ambassador to Moscow. Already a vice president of the IOC,
Samaranch had a clear aim in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years after joining the IOC in 1966, I had started
thinking about being president,'' he recalled. ``Moscow was
preparing the Olympics of 1980, and I knew that going there would
be a good move for my ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   As it was. When Lord Killanin of Ireland stepped down in 1980,
Samaranch was elected with an absolute majority of 47 votes in the
first round. Hispanic and Soviet-bloc votes helped do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Many, however, saw the presidency as a poisoned chalice.
``Everybody was writing the Olympic obituary,'' said Michael Payne,
a British IOC member who oversees marketing. ``We were politically
and financially bankrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   After the African boycott of the 1976 Summer Games in Montreal,
60 Western nations, led by the United States, boycotted the 1980
Moscow Games over the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Sport seemed
a Cold War victim. The IOC had less than $500,000 in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch responded with an extraordinary energy, apparently
driven by his abhorrence of conflict, his Spanish experience of
political reconciliation and his vision of an all-embracing
Olympics. Wherever he could, and by whatever means, he reached out
to extend the Olympic family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has always known how to soften people and he impregnated
the Olympics with this art,'' said Jaume Boix Angelats, the author
of a critical biography of Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   Where Samaranch appears to have failed is in not perceiving that
making the Olympics bigger _ his unswerving goal _ required
balancing with tighter controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cost-effectiveness and Internet-style openness are concepts
foreign to him,'' said Alberto Montagut, an editor of the Catalan
edition of the newspaper El Mundo. ``Resignation does not exist in
his culture, because it is the act of an accountable type of
management.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, management was not much of an issue for the Olympic
movement: there was almost no money to manage.
</P>
<P>
   When Hodler, the Swiss IOC member, joined in the early 1960s, he
recalled that the only revenue was the 40 Swiss francs ($29) paid
each year by members _ providing overall annual revenue of about
$300.
</P>
<P>
   Under Samaranch, however, the quaint poverty of aristocrats and
gentlemen gave way to the rigorously commercialized wealth of
managers of the lucrative five-ringed Olympic brand.
</P>
<P>
   After Peter Ueberroth demonstrated at Los Angeles in 1984 that
clever marketing could make the Olympics profitable, IOC income
from sales of television rights, exclusive corporate sponsorships,
licensing agreements and tickets soared. Worldwide television and
sponsorship rights are now worth $3.5 billion for the 1997-2000
period alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We changed the Olympic movement,'' Samaranch said. ``We made
it universal. We gave it the means to help people. We held one
Olympics after another that was a triumph.''

<P>
   When Cesar Chavez was leading the farm workers in the lush
valleys of California, he surely had little time to work out on the
treadmill.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true for Patrick Ewing, who gave himself to his
union during the time of the troubles. However, now that there is
certified contractual peace in the National Basketball Association,
Ewing, more than anybody else, may be paying the price for his
dedication to the cause.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the association looked as if he was carrying a
few file folders and cellular phones under his uniform Friday night
as the Knicks were wiped out in Orlando, 93-85. He will have plentyof chance to play himself into shape because there are more games
where that one came from - 49 more in the next three months,
including Sunday's matinee against the Man With the Mousse.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. Matt Winick, that droll schedule-maker with the
NBA, had the delightful touch to sent Pat (Hit Me With Your Best
Shot) Riley back into the belly of the beast on the very first
Sunday afternoon of this short and furious season.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks take on the Miami Heat in the Garden opener at 1 p.m.
before the New Jersey Nets take on Orlando in the Meadowlands at 6
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   While Ewing was diligently attending negotiations and generally
exasperating everybody (including most of his union mates) with his
insensitive comments about life-and-death struggles, many other
players were keeping their profiles down as well as their weight.
The standup comedian, Jayson Williams of the Nets, seems to be in
great shape, which only reinforces the old remedy that laughter is
the best medicine.
</P>
<P>
   When A. Philip Randolph was organizing the Brotherhood of
Sleeping Car Porters, he also had little time to get to the gym.
During the long evening in Orlando, Ewing seemed continually off
balance. Well, who wouldn't be, carrying an attache case strapped
to his waist? In the fourth quarter, with the Knicks down by 7,
Patrick had a chance for an offensive rebound and a monster dunk,
if only he could have gotten off his feet. He attempted to tip the
ball with his wrist, basically flatfooted, and the ball skittered
away harmlessly, and so did the game.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever it is that owns the Knicks as of this edition would
surely be justified in wondering whether this club will be the
ultimate victim of the strike. Not always the most cognizant
person, Ewing says he will play himself into shape. He has never
been 36 years old before, nor has he ever tried playing 50 games in
90 days.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Knicks just might evolve into a more
mobile offensive force. The noted pacifist Latrell Sprewell is a
lithe full-court presence not quite like anybody the Knicks have
ever had. So maybe the Knicks are a work-in-progress. Besides, they
were not going to win anything with Good Old Oak and Good Old John
and Good Old Patrick playing the same weary game. The Knicks are
going to be different, but the Bulls have no relationship to
anything that happened in the past. If the NBA played under the
same format as European soccer leagues, then the Bulls would be in
dire danger of finishing dead last and being relegated to the
Continental Basketball Association. Or maybe Jerry Reinsdorf would
not have torched his team if there were a penalty for being
dreadful.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I think about it, considering the frantic scrambling
for free agents in the wake of the settlement, the bulk of the NBA
has a relatively settled feel to it _ at least in the first wave of
box scores.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie and Mark in Indiana. Mutombo and Smith in Atlanta. Duncan
and Robinson in San Antonio. Sloan and Malone and Stockton in Utah.
Hill and Dumars in Detroit. And a nation of strangers in
Sacramento. Sounds like normal for the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets used to have the feel of Sacramento East, a turnpike
team where players stopped on their way from somewhere to anywhere.
But now they've got a nice little team in the swamp.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets may be more than tantalizing with added maturity from
Jayson Williams and Keith Van Horn and maybe even Sam Cassell to
say nothing of John Calipari, the coach himself, whose energy and
ego were often a distraction in his first two years.
</P>
<P>
   Will anybody care? There were first-night indications that fans
are not filling up the arenas. The league had better look exciting
in a hurry because spring is not all that far away in the northern
tier, and people could be into gardening and exercise and baseball
and going out for dimsum on peaceful Sunday afternoons instead of
watching the tall blokes on the tube. The first robin and Bernie
Williams and Mike Piazza are coming soon. There will not be much
patience for a ragged product.
</P>
<P>
   And that brings us back to the Knicks. When Samuel Gompers was
organizing the cigar workers, he probably could not afford a
personal trainer. Patrick Ewing could have.

<P>
   Hussein ibn Talal, a pivotal and sometimes heroic figure in the
Middle East, will be laid to rest with all the pomp and pageantry
of royalty: the Bedouin desert warriors in their red-checked
keffiyahs and smartly crossed leather ammunition belts; the
Circassian palace guards _ Muslims uprooted from the Caucasus _ in
high-booted, fur-hatted uniforms like cossacks; the crown, the
banners, symbols of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, a dynasty
stretching back through the mists of time to . . . May 25, 1946.
</P>
<P>
   In the Middle East, Egyptian diplomat Taseen Bashir likes to
say, only Egypt and Iran are real countries, places with a cohesive
history of nationhood; the rest are ``tribes with flags.''
</P>
<P>
   And of all the artificial countries created by the victorious
European powers who drew arbitrary lines on maps after World War I,
none was more artificial than the tiny, poor, lawless leftover
patch of desert that would become Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Even the flag was artificial. The green, red, white and black
banner that fluttered over Arab raiders led by the Hashemite family
against the Ottoman Empire _ the basis for today's flags of Jordan
and the Palestine Liberation Organization _ was designed by a
British Foreign Service officer named Sir Mark Sykes and produced
by his army's supply shop in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   But Sykes is not remembered as the Betsy Ross of Arabia. He is
better known as half of a secret double-cross _ the Sykes-Picot
agreement of 1916 _ in which the British effectively sold out their
Arab allies by recognizing French interests in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, from this unpromising land, King Hussein and has
grandfather, King Abdullah, forged, largely by sheer force of
personality, the most modern nation in the Arab world. They did it
through dangerous decades of war with Israel and the frequent
hostility of their fellow Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   Even while clinging tenaciously to the old symbols _ Hussein's
personal aircraft is named the Qureish for the tribe of the Prophet
Mohammed, from whom he claims descent _ these unlikely survivors
developed a legitimacy far more in tune with the 20th century, one
that rests on a social contract with the royal family's people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a social contract that harks back to the monarchy of
older times,'' said Fouad Ajami, a leading scholar of the region.
``The record of the Hashemites stands out as one of great
moderation and tolerance; they were temperate, merciful rulers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always a turbulent realm, and when necessary there was
an iron fist in the velvet glove. But there was a legacy of
forgiving; even assassins were forgiven and rehabilitated. They
made a going concern of this modest realm and helped their people
escape the furies of the region around them.''
</P>
<P>
   The back story of the Hashemite monarchy begins on the eve of
World War I, in which the decaying Ottoman Empire would be allied
with Germany and Austria-Hungary. At the center of Ottoman rule was
the caliph, the supreme religious leader of Islam. But in the Arab
lands there were secret stirrings of nationalism, chafing against
Turkish rule.
</P>
<P>
   The British military commander, Lord Kitchener, and his
fledgling Middle East experts wanted to fan the flames of Arab
resistance; they hit on a scheme to create a new caliph, beholden
to them, in hopes that Britain could control the region after the
war. Their candidate was King Hussein's great-grandfather, Emir
Hussein of the Hejaz, the Sharif of Mecca, or guardian of Islam's
holiest places at the far southern edge of the Arabian Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   He duly declared the Great Arab Revolt in 1916 _ an affair of
machinations, blunders and betrayals all around that is told in
admirable detail in ``A Peace to End All Peace'' by David Fromkin
(Avon Books, 1989). For the less rigorous, this is the tale told in
the movie ``Lawrence of Arabia.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arab revolt was actually not all that great, historians now
say. It enlisted only a few thousand tribesmen and its exploits
were inflated by two master storytellers, the American
correspondent Lowell Thomas and Capt. T.E. Lawrence himself.
Nevertheless, the Arab army under Hussein's youngest son, Feisal
(Omar Sharif in the movie), led the victorious allies into
Damascus, the regional capital, on Oct. 1, 1918.
</P>
<P>
   The Arab nationalists planned for Feisal to become king in
Damascus and his older brother, Abdullah, to be king in Baghdad.
But the European powers, carving up the Ottoman remains, had other
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Feisal reigned in Damascus only momentarily, until the French
took control there under the Sykes-Picot understanding. Then, with
British help, he moved his franchise to Baghdad, where his family
ruled until they were killed in a 1958 military coup.
</P>
<P>
   Back home in the Hejaz, the Hashemite dream of ruling as caliphs
failed too. Sharif Hussein proclaimed himself caliph on March 5,
1924, two days after the secularizing Young Turks now ruling
Istanbul abolished the office. But Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud, who bore
Hussein's family many grudges, led the Wahhabis _ the Muslim
fundamentalists of their day _ out of the desert and kicked Hussein
out in 1925, seizing the guardianship of the holy places and
creating Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Many years later, when King Hussein would not line up against
Iraq in the Gulf War against the Saudis, he would refer to himself
as the sharif, in echo of his great-grandfather's claim.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another wartime promise _ the Balfour Declaration of
1917, anticipating a Jewish homeland in the British mandate in
Palestine _ would shape events in the region for decades.

<P>
   In early 1921, Abdullah turned up in the unpromising sands in
the eastern part of the mandate with an armed entourage, announcing
he was on his way to conquer Syria. Abdullah had been the original
architect of the alliance with the British, but Lawrence had
shunted him aside as charming and wily _ ``a tool too complex for
such a simple purpose'' _ in favor of Feisal.
</P>
<P>
   It was the beginning of the process by which Abdullah and his
grandson, King Hussein, would remain in the desert and create the
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Winston Churchill, then colonial secretary, claimed he created
Jordan ``in an afternoon,'' by splitting off the territory in the
Palestine mandate east of the Jordan River into Transjordan in 1923
(although it continued to be administered as a mandate territory
until independence in 1946).
</P>
<P>
   This split avoided confrontations with France over who would
rule Damascus. And by naming Abdullah emir, or prince, and later
king, Churchill said, the British could ``repair the damage done to
the Arabs'' and the Hashemites.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Transjordan could serve as a safety valve for
Arabs who might leave the Palestine mandate as Jews streamed in.
The British subsidized Transjordan with millions of dollars, and
organized, trained and officered its army, the Arab Legion. This
force became the strongest in the Arab world. In 1948, it alone
held against the nascent Israelis, crossing the Jordan River to
take the West Bank and the holy sites in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   For both Abdullah and Hussein, ruling Jordan was always a
complex and potentially deadly balancing act. They had to satisfy
their Western patrons (first Britain, then the United States) while
keeping at bay their enemies (mostly Arab) and, above all, coping
with the vexing problem of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Urbane by upbringing and nature, they nevertheless appeared at
home among the desert tribes who formed the backbone of their army
and their political base.
</P>
<P>
   As king, Hussein would find the balancing act even more
difficult. He was only 15 in 1951 when he saw his grandfather
gunned down next to him on the steps of al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem
by a Palestinian nationalist. He struggled, more than his
grandfather had, to balance his own modern and Western impulses
with Arab traditions and, often, anger. Still, in a land without
natural resources, he was able to build an educational system that
turned the population into a resource, able to work abroad in the
oil states.
</P>
<P>
   Under his rule, Jordan did not evolve into a full democracy but
it built a freewheeling Parliament and a relatively open press, in
sharp distinction to its Arab neighbors. King Hussein commanded an
effective intelligence service, or Mukhabarat, but ruled by a kind
of mass popularity rather than the fear of the secret police that
characterizes Syria and Iraq and is mitigated in Egypt only by
inefficiency and corruption. Palestinians numbered two-thirds of
the population of his country, swollen by refugees from the wars in
Israel and the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the decisions were costly: joining in the disastrous
Six Day War against Israel in 1967 and choosing not to join the
fight against Iraq in the 1991 gulf war. Ajami believes that
``history will judge these survival calls,'' for the king could not
withstand the mood of his own subjects. But in 1967 he lost the
valuable West Bank and holy sites, and in 1991, the desperately
needed subsidies and support from the oil-rich Gulf countries,
compounding his economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   At other times, there was raw, physical courage, as when he led
his army to expel the Palestinian commandos in the Black September
of 1970, earning him the nickname of ``PLK,'' which stood for
Plucky Little King.
</P>
<P>
   There were secret meetings over the years with Israel's leaders.
There were assassination attempts; once Syrian jets tried to shoot
down his private plane.
</P>
<P>
   And, at the end, he struggled most of all to find some peace for
the Middle East.

   WASHINGTON _ The Navy cannot put full crews aboard its warships.
The Air Force has a shortage of pilots. Recruiting soldiers has
become so difficult that between now and May, the Army will give
$3,000 up front to any reasonably able young man or woman who
enlists.

   Now, relax, all you draft-eligible young men (and maybe even
young women) out there. It's early yet to start reviving old
excuses for the draft board or packing your bags for Canada.
</P>
<P>
   But a quarter century after the last conscripts mustered at boot
camp, the idea of reviving the draft has gained new currency among
a small group of academics, lawmakers and even military commanders.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that a restoration of the draft _ perhaps as part of
some wider program of compulsory national service _ would not only
solve the personnel crises facing today's volunteer forces but also
provide an antidote to the military's growing detachment from
society.
</P>
<P>
   In January, The Army Times called for the draft, saying it would
make up for recruiting shortfalls and insure that political leaders
``would enter office understanding the military, its strengths and
weaknesses, and its culture.''
</P>
<P>
   In his recent book about the Marines, ``Making the Corps''
(Scribner, 1997), Thomas E. Ricks, a reporter for The Wall Street
Journal, argued that conscription was needed to rectify what he
regards as an ominous alienation of the military's warrior culture.
</P>
<P>
   He and others say it would restore to American society a sense
of collective duty and sacrifice lost after the draft ended in
1973. This is the sort of sentiment behind the popularity of
``Saving Private Ryan'' and Tom Brokaw's new book, ``The Greatest
Generation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's certainly worth considering,'' Capt. Thomas
Otterbein, commander of the Navy's newest aircraft carrier, the
Harry S. Truman, said when asked about the draft. ``We, as a
people, don't seem to have the same national ethos we used to have,
where public service, whether it be military or some other aspect
of it, was sort of expected.''
</P>
<P>
   It would take an act of Congress to restore the expired Military
Selective Service Act, and that is not about to happen, given the
political, social and economic forces arrayed against the idea of
interrupting the fledgling careers of today's youth at a time of
peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, too, the debate that would have to take place about the
question of women. When there was last a draft, America was a
different place. The notion of conscripting women was almost
unthinkable (though not entirely, since for a time during World War
II, the Army worried that it might have to draft female nurses to
staff its field hospitals).
</P>
<P>
   Today, women make up 14 percent of the military, serving in
virtually all except the most combat-intensive units. In the
attacks on Iraq in December, women even flew jets into combat from
the deck of the aircraft carrier Enterprise. Excluding women from
the draft today would raise vexing questions about equality and
women's role in society.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to ask people to send their sons to battle,''
one Pentagon official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``Is anybody going to support sending their daughters?''
</P>
<P>
   For this and other reasons, the overwhelming majority of the
nation's uniformed leaders oppose the idea of reviving the draft on
its face. Most of them are old enough to remember the malcontents
that the draft foisted on the Army and, to a lesser extent, the
Marine Corps. (The Air Force and Navy always had enough volunteers,
many motivated by the desire to avoid being drafted into the grunt
forces of the Army or Marines.)
</P>
<P>
   The uniformed leaders say today's military is better-educated,
better-trained and better-motivated than any conscripted force ever
was or could be again.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy De Leon, the undersecretary of defense for personnel and
readiness, said that nothing short of a supreme national emergency
would rally the public support necessary to reinstitute the draft.
``The notion that the country would have a draft absent a critical
problem is out of sync with our history,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that conscription cuts against the American grain.
Through most of its history, the United States has depended on
volunteers to fight its wars and keep its peace. The nation first
drafted soldiers in 1861 at the beginning of the Civil War, when it
faced the ultimate emergency: survival. It did not do so again
until May 1917; 15 months later, the drafted ended before World War
I did.
</P>
<P>
   President Franklin D. Roosevelt revived the draft in 1940 _
technically the first peacetime draft, though war was clearly
imminent. A year later, only weeks before Pearl Harbor, it survived
a congressional challenge by only a single vote. After a brief
respite following World War II, the nation's longest period of
compulsory service began in 1948. It lasted 25 years, through the
Cold War, Korea, the Berlin airlift, the Cuban missile crisis.
</P>
<P>
   President Richard M. Nixon, a Republican who campaigned against
the draft, let the Selective Service Act expire in 1973. It was the
Vietnam War, of course, that killed the draft, but not just because
the war was unpopular. The draft was widely viewed as unfair. Those
with the means or the connections _ Bill Clinton, Dan Quayle _
avoided conscription. Those who didn't _ poor farm boys,
blue-collar workers, blacks _ went to the jungles.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Charles Moskos, an expert on military affairs at Northwestern
University and an advocate of compulsory service, said a draft
could once again be a socially binding force, if designed to
include the nation's elite. He recalled that two-thirds of his
graduating class at Princeton in 1956 went into the military, the
same year Elvis Presley answered the Army's call-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all knew Elvis Presley was 45 kilometers down the road,''
Moskos said of his tour in Germany. ``Can you imagine Michael
Jackson in the Army today?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, no. But while a revival of the draft is remote, the
question is not as academic as it might seem. By law today, as
during the draft, every American male citizen or permanent resident
between 18 and 25 is required to register with the Selective
Service System. A high compliance rate is insured in part by the
fact that proof of draft registration is a prerequisite for federal
jobs, job training or student financial aid. (Many states have
similar requirements.) Ninety-one percent of those eligible _ more
than 10 million men _ are now a draft card away from military
service should the need arise. Failing to register is a federal
felony punishable by up to 5 years in prison and $250,000 fine,
though the crime hasn't been prosecuted in years.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, some members of Congress have mused publicly
about reinstating the draft, including Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a
prisoner of war in Vietnam, and Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C.,
Republican chairman of the House's Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   And the military's mounting personnel woes have given the idea
new seriousness. With the economy thriving and young people less
willing than ever to consider a hitch in the military, let alone a
career, the services are scrambling to find enough recruits for
even today's trimmed-down military.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy fell short of its recruiting goals last year by nearly
7,000 sailors, and the shortfall is now manifesting itself as
shortages of sailors in the fleet. In the first quarter of this
fiscal year, the Army fell short by 2,345 recruits, nearly 20
percent below its goal for the period, despite new ads, bonuses and
an increase in college aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to reach a point where we can't rely on volunteers
anymore,'' one Army official fretted.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Pentagon hopes to solve the problem with an
across-the-board pay raise, targeted raises for the middle ranks
and better retirement benefits. The services are also taking steps,
some of them controversial. The Navy plans to recruit more youths
who have not finished high school. The Army hopes to target the
nation's growing Hispanic population, where many young men and
women seem more eager to serve than non-Hispanic whites or blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Admiral Jay Johnson, who as chief of naval operations is the
Navy's top officer, said that even with recruiting problems, it was
``pretty tough to beat'' the force he has. Today's Navy, he said,
is ``a high-quality, all-volunteer force, people who are here
because they want to be, not because they have to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, somebody might say, `Yeah, OK, Johnson, what if you can't
get that force?''' he said. ``If you can't get that force, then I
guess we have to have another discussion.''

   WASHINGTON _ The Navy cannot put full crews aboard its warships.
The Air Force has a shortage of pilots. Recruiting soldiers has
become so difficult that between now and May, the Army will give
$3,000 up front to any reasonably able young man or woman who
enlists.

TYSON, SENT BACK TO PRISON, WAS NOT SEEN AS SERIOUS CONTENDER FOR A
TITLE   
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Mike Tyson was led away to the Montgomery County Maryland
jail in handcuffs on Friday afternoon to serve a one-year sentence
on two counts of second degree assault, he left behind a trail of
broken financial commitments, which will cast a huge cloud over his
future in boxing. However, his departure barely left a ripple in
the heavyweight pool, because he wasn't a serious contender for a
world championship.
</P>
<P>
   After he regained his boxing license from the Nevada State
Athletic Commission on Oct. 19, Tyson, and his new team of
advisors, were able to cash in on his still immense, though fading,
popularity. In light of his lackluster performance against Francois
Botha (he was trailing on all cards before he knocked out Botha in
the fifth round) and Friday's jail sentence for assaulting a
50-year-old man and a 62-year-old man following a minor traffic
accident last Aug. 31, Tyson becomes an even more difficult sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people around Tyson look at him as a money tree,'' said
Promoter Bob Arum, president of Top Rank Boxing. ``They couldn't
wait until it blossomed to bear fruit. Wouldn't it have been better
to get this situation in Maryland handled properly before putting
him back in the ring? The people around Tyson have to take stock of
what's important now. His family should use this time to get him
the extensive psychological help that he needs.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of their defense to keep Tyson out of jail, Tyson's
lawyers painted a bleak future if the former heavyweight champion
was sentenced to jail time on the assault charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he gets jail time for one day, he's done, finished,
according to the Nevada Commission,'' said Paul Kemp, Tyson's
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Kizer, a Nevada assistant attorney general, said Tyson
can't be barred from fighting this year, because his license is
good through the end of 1999. But he must go before the commission
to get a license for 2000. Whether he gets one for 2000 is
completely at the discretion of the five commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   With Tyson going to jail, and possibly returning to prison in
Indiana for violating the conditions of his probation, Showtime
Cable network, the MGM Grand, which had signed Tyson to a
four-fight deal for an undisclosed amount, and Tyson's former
trainer, Kevin Rooney, who recently reached an $8.6 million
settlement over a breach of contract lawsuit, are big losers.
Rooney received $2.5 million following the Botha fight and was to
receive the balance over Tyson's next two fights. Showtime signed
Tyson to a four-fight, $33 million deal. They also took over all
the liens that the Internal Revenue Service had placed on Tyson's
homes in Las Vegas and Connecticut by paying off his $14 million
tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Larkin, Showtime senior vice president of sports and event
programming, was at the Montgomery County District Court on Friday
during Tyson's sentencing hearing. He had no comment. The
Tyson-Botha pay per view did 600,000 buys, which was well short of
the record 1.9 million buys that Tyson did in his rematch against
Evander Holyfield on June 28, 1997. That was the fight that set
Tyson on his current downward spiral. He became upset at Holyfield
during the bout, because he said that Holyfield was head butting
him and he wasn't getting any protection from referee Mills Lane.
So, Tyson bit both of Holyfield's ears and was disqualified.
Subsequently, the Nevada commission revoked Tyson's license and he
was out of boxing for 19 months. During that time, he had three
hearings to regain his boxing license (one in New Jersey and two in
Las Vegas), and had his run in with the two Maryland motorists,
Abimelec Saucedo, 62, and Richard Hardick, 50. Tyson also battled
depression and took Zoloft, an anti-depressant, off and on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started getting letters from the IRS saying they were going
to take the house and all our stuff,'' said Monica Tyson, Tyson's
wife. ``He was depressed a lot about that.'' Tyson had stopped
taking the drugs when he assaulted Saucedo and Hardick.
</P>
<P>
   The Nevada commission gave him his license back after he passed
a grueling battery of psychological examines by a group of
psychologists and psychiatrists at Massachusetts General Hospital
in Boston. Though Tyson was determined mentally fit to return to
the ring, the psychologists said there was no way to guarantee that
Tyson would not react violently inside or outside of the ring
again.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Stephen P. Johnson thought that Tyson, despite his weekly
sessions with a psychologist, still hadn't learned how to
effectively managed his anger. If he had, Johnson believes, Tyson
never would have gone after two elderly men that he didn't know
after a minor fender bender.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Tyson never said a word during the sentencing hearing on Friday,
dismissively waving off Johnson when he asked if he had anything he
wanted to say before he imposed the sentence. For most of the four
hours he sat dispassionately at a table before Johnson as a parade
of defense character witnesses attested to his fine character.
There wasn't even a reaction when he was sentenced.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Paul Kemp, and Carol Crawford, an assistant
prosecutor, painted conflicting pictures of Tyson. Kemp said that
Crawford's argument that Tyson should be given jail time because of
his propensity toward violence was nothing more than ``a shrill,
sensational call for vegeance.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford didn't put on one witness to counter what Kemp said
about Tyson. Instead she relied on an 11-page memo Douglas Gansler,
the Montgomery County prosecutor who took office in January, sent
to Johnson on Jan. 4 and 126 pages of documents that included news
articles and transcripts from television interviews that depicted
Tyson as violence-prone. Kemp said those items were merely
pre-fight hype and bravado that Tyson used to promote his bout with
Botha and were not based in reality.
</P>
<P>
   But Crawford said what happened to Saucedo and Hardick was very
real and it was made even worst by the fact that the accident was
``at best a minor inconvenience and at worst a petty annoyance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine what it must feel like to have an agitated Mike Tyson
headed toward you?'' Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when Mike Tyson's anger and rage served him
well. It fueled his rise from a Brownsville juvenile delinquent to
the youngest heavyweight champion ever at age 20. Inside and
outside the ring it went unchallenged, except for civil lawsuits,
until he was convicted of raping Desiree Washington, a beauty
pageant contestant, in 1992. That rape conviction made it difficult
for Johnson to let Tyson go with just a slap on the wrist in this
case. His free rides are over.
</P>
<P>
   The heavyweight division moved forward while Tyson was out for
19 months. And his return bout against Botha was nothing more than
a blip on the screen. With Holyfield and Lewis set to meet in a
heavyweight unification bout on March 13 in Madison Square Garden,
Tyson's absence won't make a difference in the overall scene. The
boxers that Tyson was considering as opponents _ Axel Schulz and
Brian Nielsen _ don't figure prominently in anyone's heavyweight
championship scenerio.
</P>
<P>
   Shelly Finkel, Tyson's advisor, said he had anticipated the
boxer fighting four times this year. But his April 24th fight isn't
going to happen. Gansler said Tyson could be released after six
months, with time off for good behavior. If Judge Patricia Gifford,
the Indiana judge who presided over Tyson's rape trial in
Indianapolis, doesn't decide to revoke his probation, then he would
be back for a fight in the fall. But will his act continue to play
with the public?
</P>
<P>
   ''Tyson is no longer a fighter,'' Arum said. ``He's a curiosity.
People who want to see him fight and bought the pay per view for
his last fight weren't interested in boxing. They were watching on
the chance that something bizarre would happen.'' Arum added:
``You're not going to see the end of him until he winds up dead.
Unless he gets the help he needs, you haven't seen the worst of him
yet, either.''

<P>
   If anyone had suggested during the Cold War that former CIA and
KGB agents would one day be working together as business partners
to provide sensitive information to U.S. corporations, the idea
would have seemed too far-fetched to be believed.
</P>
<P>
   But that is exactly what is happening today as hundreds of
out-of-work spies from the United States and Russia are joining
hands in the pursuit of capitalism, providing protection,
intelligence and political risk assessments to U.S. companies
extending their reach to emerging markets and other global hot
spots.
</P>
<P>
   They include men like Gen. Victor Budanov, a former chief of
counterintelligence for the KGB, who formed a joint venture with
Gerard Burke, who was once assistant director of the National
Security Agency. Budanov heads the Moscow office of Parvus
International, a business intelligence firm in Silver Spring, Md.,
founded by Burke that employs former CIA, KGB and Soviet-bloc
agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not talk about our former jobs,'' Budanov said. ``We are
in a new life and we are now partners in the same boat of helping
our American clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the American Society for Industrial Security, a trade group
with 35,000 members representing private security companies, has a
Moscow chapter with about 35 ex-employees of the Soviet
intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows the territory there better than former KGB
officers?'' said Joseph Ricci, a spokesman for the group. ``Some of
our members at first had a hard time with having a Russian chapter
_ but then most of our members started out working for the U.S.
government. But these KGB guys are not employed by their government
anymore and they have to make a living. Their loyalty is to who is
putting food on their table.''
</P>
<P>
   Business intelligence firms provide U.S. corporations operating
overseas with information about local politics and pitfalls,
protection for executives and background data on local business
partners.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Parvus keep American businesses from stumbling
into bad business arrangements in far-flung places like Kazakhstan,
Russia and the Ukraine and bail them out when they do _ helping
them deal with kidnappings, fraud, theft and extortion.
</P>
<P>
   For many of these firms, it makes perfect sense to employ former
spies, many of whom have spent their lives studying other cultures,
speak many languages and can often surreptitiously ferret out
information through networks of local contacts _ both among local
government officials and shadier types.
</P>
<P>
   ``Former KGB officers, like our CIA, are the best and the
brightest,'' said Frederick Rustmann, a retired CIA officer who is
head of CTC International (named after the CIA's Counter-Terrorism
Center), a firm in West Palm Beach, Fla., with six former CIA
agents and one ex-KGB officer on staff and scores of former
Soviet-bloc spies on retainer abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all in the same trade and we all learned the same
techniques,'' Rustmann said. ``KGB officers are naturals. We use
them to collect information for us and for security. You can rent a
former KGB agent with four languages, a gun and a car for 50 bucks
a day. And he'll interpret for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Many former Russian spies are available because the KGB was
broken up into several agencies and scaled back after 1991, and the
financial rewards are far greater on the outside. And the recent
political and economic turmoil in Russia has only increased the
demand for their services, with Western companies scrambling for
more intelligence and protection than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   But don't the spies feel a little weird about working side by
side with their former adversaries? Apparently not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, our countries were enemies, but many of us were
friends,'' Rustmann said. ``The fact is, when I was in Libya I had
lots of KGB friends. Our backgrounds are similar, our psychology
and training are similar. We used to go on picnics together and our
families were friends. I was always trying to recruit Boris and he
was trying to recruit me.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke said in the six years that Parvus has been doing business
in Moscow, only once did a client _ a Fortune 100 company _ raise
questions about whether former KGB agents were trustworthy. Burke
dealt with this concern by slowly introducing his KGB staffers to
the American client and then increasing their level of
responsibility and accessibility to corporate secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in this business for many years and I'm able to vet
these people carefully,'' Burke said. ``From time to time in the
back alleys of the world, you are confronted with a lot of
inducements and you see a very, very dark side. There are some
former spies I wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole.''
</P>
<P>
   Many former Soviet-bloc spies say they are still serving their
countries, only in a new way, by making sure that American
businesses keep capital invested in their homelands. ``Instead of
doing stupid Cold War stuff, we have finally found some useful
purpose in life,'' said one former spy who asked not to be named.
``We want to make sure that American investors don't get burned
here so that capital keeps flowing in. What used to be a lethal
weapon has now become very peaceable.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ When Frederick Mc Phail Jr., a 27-year-old New
York University graduate student, was found dead here at dawn last
fall in his parked car, reeking of alcohol, only his family knew
something was outrageously wrong with official accounts of his
death.
</P>
<P>
   The police said he had drowned in his own vomit after a
late-night binge with liquor and women. But his family knew Mc
Phail as a virtual teetotaler. At his last dinner, on Nov. 17
during a visit here, he drank one beer and three Diet Cokes.
</P>
<P>
   Mysteries like this usually disappear, unclarified, into the
Mexican government's chaotic files, feeding the frustrations of a
society fed up with police corruption and ineptitude. But with
Mexico City in the hands of a reform government that is seeking to
root out police graft, this case ended differently.
</P>
<P>
   An enterprising detective checked Mc Phail's bank records and
found cash withdrawals from automatic teller machines all over
Mexico City in the hours before his death. That led to another
stunning discovery. Videotape from bank security cameras showed
three men withdrawing Mc Phail's money, all of them Mexico City
police officers. One was wearing his bullet-proof vest, his badge
number visible.
</P>
<P>
   A subsequent investigation came to a climax last week with the
arrest and indictment of five officers for Mc Phail's death. The
authorities said the officers forced Mc Phail to drink an entire
bottle of liquor to make him incapable of identifying them as the
assailants who stole his bank cards. Prosecutors have identified a
dozen other victims, including three foreign tourists, who they
believe were victimized by the same rogue officers.
</P>
<P>
   The case has attracted special attention here because the
murdered student's father, Frederick Mc Phail Sr., a wealthy U.S.
businessman who lives in Mexico, bought newspaper advertisements
calling his son ``one more victim of the violence'' here. Mc Phail
Sr. says the ads have brought an outpouring of public outrage, with
250 Mexicans and Americans telephoning him, many describing their
own victimization by the police.
</P>
<P>
   Mc Phail Sr. has formed a nonprofit association, called Fredy
Protects, that he says will seek to help crime victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case shows how corruption and police violence have just
become rampant in Mexico,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The photograph of Mc Phail Jr. in the advertisement shows a
handsome athletic man with an easygoing smile. Born in Mexico City
to American parents, Mc Phail attended high school at the Kent
School in Kent, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frederick contributed a lot to our school,'' Don Gowan, Kent's
former dean of students, said in a phone interview. ``He was
outgoing, had a great sense of humor, just a super personality.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Mc Phail studied business administration at
Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City. After receiving his
bachelor's degree in 1994, he moved to Jersey City, commuting to
Manhattan to work as a planner for a shipping company.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, he married an analyst for a Manhattan brokerage firm
and last spring began attending banking courses at New York
University's School of Continuing Education. Enrolling in the fall
in a graduate finance program, he returned to Mexico City to pick
up his college transcripts, his father said.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 17, the night before his scheduled return to New York,
he dined out with his father and brother. The three left the
restaurant at 11:15 p.m., and Mc Phail drove off into the Mexico
City night.
</P>
<P>
   His body was found the next morning, slumped in his car a few
blocks away. Forensic examiners found high levels of alcohol in his
blood.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, city detectives assumed that he had got wildly drunk
in the red light district, but the case was not dropped.
Examination of his bank records showed automated withdrawals
totaling about $800 before his death, and investigators subpoenaed
videos from the banks. The photos showed three men huddled around
the cash machines, including a uniformed officer whose badge number
identified him as Lucio Tapia Galindo. Police records showed that
on Nov. 17 he had been assigned to a patrol car alongside Francisco
Leon Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   With suspicion falling on the police, the case was transferred
to a special anti-corruption unit, headed by Hugo Vera Reyes, the
prosecutor whose investigation of fraud last year in a computer
procurement contract led IBM de Mexico to repay $37.5 million to
the city treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing police files, Vera's investigators turned up a June
1998 complaint by a Salvador Castillo Prieto, who said he had been
seized by police officers who stole his bank cards and forced him
to drink five tumblers of vodka. The officers had been tentatively
identified later as Tapia and Leon.
</P>
<P>
   The detail about the vodka led investigators to search through
hundreds of case files, identifying 10 other victims who had
complained of being pulled over by patrol cars, compelled to drive
to parking garages or vacant lots, robbed of their bank cards, and
forced to guzzle large amounts of cheap liquor. The victims
included tourists from Germany, Brazil and Norway.
</P>
<P>
   Some were beaten with nightsticks to force them to drink, but
most agreed after psychological pressure, Vera said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Getting wind of the investigation, Tapia and Leon abandoned
their patrol car on Dec. 7, leaving behind uniforms and service
revolvers, Vera said. They fled north, crossed illegally into the
United States, and found construction work in Florence, Texas.
Investigators who befriended their wives tracked their movements,
and Mexican detectives traveled to Texas and photographed Tapia,
Leon and three other Mexico City officers living in a trailer park.
The other officers were also traced to Mc Phail's murder and other
crimes, Vera said.
</P>
<P>
   The rogue officers were deported by American authorities,
arrested and charged with Mc Phail's murder last week and multiple
counts of robbery.

because there is so much clamor and because of Abiola,'' said
Kabiru Gaya, a prominent member of the All People's Party, one of
the country's three parties and the one most clearly identified
with the north.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like someone being wounded,'' continued Gaya, 46, a
former governor of Kano State, as the movie-screen-size television
in his conference room was switched on to CNN. ``And this is the
only way to treat the wound.''
</P>
<P>
   The wound stems from what is called the ``June 12 issue.'' On
that date in 1993, Moshood K.O. Abiola, a billionaire businessman
from the Yoruba southwest, appeared to win Nigeria's presidential
elections, only to see them annulled by the northern-dominated
military.
</P>
<P>
   As Nigeria prepares to hold presidential elections on Feb. 27,
no single leader seems capable of healing this gash. The wound
threatens to deepen the disunity in a country of 108 million people
riven along ethnic, religious and geographic lines, even as the
price of the one product that makes Nigeria matter to the United
States and the West _ oil _ has plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nigerian electorate has lost faith in the entire political
system,'' said Sule Lamido, 50, a prominent member of the People's
Democratic Party. ``We need someone to give all Nigeria a sense of
belonging, but there is no one who can do that now.''
</P>
<P>
   So, to keep Nigeria together, a consensus has emerged among
politicians in the north _ whose generals have ruled Nigeria for
all but 10 years since independence from Britain in 1960 _ that the
next president should come from the south. The slogan for this is
the ``power shift.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether this power shift gives real power to the winner, who
will emerge from elections that are being financed and influenced
by the military, is uncertain. Whether it yields national unity is
equally uncertain, and it carries, many believe, as many seeds of
divisiveness. If the north, dominated by the largely Muslim Hausa
and Fulani peoples, concedes the next president to the south, will
he be a Yoruba Christian from the southwest or an Ibo Christian
from the southeast?
</P>
<P>
   Some even see in the north's concession a Trojan horse, a
maneuver by the north to rule by pitting the two southern groups
against each other. ``Let the south produce the next president,''
said Ahmed Jalingo, a northerner and a professor of political
science at Bayero University here. ``When they fight and fail, we
will take over. I think the military will take over temporarily,
and the south will have to accept a northern compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   There is disagreement over who should be the presidential
candidate for the People's Democratic Party, the party favored by
retired generals and the only one of the three with national
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the party's presidential aspirants are southerners,
including the two best known, Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, a former
president, and Alex Ekwueme, a former vice president. But a
national convention to choose the candidate, scheduled for this
weekend , has been postponed by three days, because of
disagreements. Gen. Obasanjo, as a career soldier, is considered
acceptable by the party's retired generals; but his own people, the
Yoruba, distrust his ties to the northern military.
</P>
<P>
   His selection as presidential candidate would alienate the Ibo,
who are backing one of their own, Ekwueme, briefly civilian vice
president two decades ago. The Ibo have supported the People's
Democratic Party, unlike the Yoruba, who essentially have formed
their own party, the Alliance for Democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance for Democracy Party and the All People's Party of
the north have agreed to present a common slate. The likely
scenario is for the Alliance for Democracy to present the
presidential candidate _ from the south _ and the All People's
Party to produce the vice president _ even though the All People's
Party won more seats nationally in the municipal and governorship
elections.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not yet clear whether the commission overseeing
Nigeria's elections will let the two parties present a joint
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The election follows one of the darkest periods in Nigeria's
history. After a northern military ruler, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida,
annulled Abiola's election, another northerner, Gen. Sani Abacha,
imprisoned Abiola in 1994, as part of a widespread crackdown on
human rights that turned Nigeria into an international pariah.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, weeks after a third northerner, Gen. Abdulsalami
Abubakar, took over after Abacha's sudden death and announced the
end of military rule, Abiola died _ still in custody.
</P>
<P>
   But the south's resentment of the north feeds on deeper wells.
Nigeria, like much of Africa, was put together haphazardly as a
nation by colonial powers. Tensions have erupted often since
independence, most violently during the Biafran civil war of the
1960s, when a million people died in an attempt by the Ibo to
secede. Most recently, scores belonging to smaller ethnic groups in
the Niger Delta region in the south have been killed, protesting
the fact that the north has monopolized oil profits and left the
oil-producing Delta without paved roads, sewers, running water or
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The north has dominated us for decades,'' said Kofoworola
Bucknor-Akerele, who was elected deputy governor of Lagos state in
January as a candidate for the Alliance for Democracy. ``Democracy
is very much part of the south. We want to restore it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alhaji Abubakar Rimi disagrees. Rimi, like Gaya a former
governor of Kano state and Communications Minister under Abacha,
said all Nigerians had been dominated by military rulers who have
enriched themselves. ``What people in the south have not been able
to do is separate the military institution from the geographic
north of Nigeria,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few and most prominent northern politicians to reject
the concept of power shift, Rimi, 58, has declared his candidacy in
the presidential primaries for the People's Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is power shift, the situation can only get worse for
the north,'' Rimi said in his private conference room. ``I know
anybody from the south who comes to power will neglect the north.
That will be dangerous for him and for Nigeria.''
</P>
<P>
   Umar Othman Tofa, who lost in the gubernatorial primaries in
Kano State in the All People's Party, said he supported the idea of
the power shift, until a candidate capable of uniting all Nigerians
emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should not be a permanent solution,'' Tofa said of the
power shift. ``But because we are in a crisis, we need power shift.
Desperate situations require desperate solutions.''

<P>
   Ever since the global financial crisis began in East Asia 19
months ago, public debate has focused on the mistake made by the
damaged countries: too much borrowing. Now the flip side of that
problem is coming into focus: too much lending.
</P>
<P>
   The latest thinking about how to stop new outbreaks of global
financial distress features proposals to slow down lending by
making it riskier and more expensive. The plans, coming from
academics and public officials, would rein in the banks, mutual
funds, hedge funds, pension funds and wealthy individuals in
industrial countries who in the 1990s poured tens of billions of
dollars in short-term loans into East Asia's booming economies.
</P>
<P>
   These loans played a huge part in precipitating bankruptcies,
bank failures, plunging currencies and recessions, first in Asia,
then in Russia and now in Brazil. When trouble came, the lenders
canceled the loans, withdrawing their money and leaving whole
countries in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that in this particular crisis, private sector
lenders have not emerged well,'' Stanley Fischer, first deputy
managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said a week
ago at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, an annual
gathering of world leaders, corporate executives, economists and
other movers and shakers.
</P>
<P>
   The lenders, naturally enough, aren't happy about the attempts
to alter their behavior. Rising from his seat in the audience,
Citigroup vice chairman Deryck Maughan responded to Fischer by
noting that lenders had already lost considerable sums in the
current crisis _ a curb in itself on overly risky lending in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, William Cline, chief economist at the Institute
for International Finance, which represents lenders, said new rules
that make lending riskier would only inhibit the flow of capital
that emerging countries will need to expand their economies once
the current global crisis ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take some time for a really strong, resurgent lending
market to revive,'' Cline said. ``It is asking for trouble to put
up impediments now to this future lending.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is the very goal of the new proposals. They seek to
avoid flooding a country with too much short-term lending that can
be quickly withdrawn. Already some nations are restricting such
lending by taxing short-term loans as they enter the country, thus
making them more expensive for the borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   The new approaches would strike at the lenders, preventing them,
for example, from pulling out their money in the event of crisis
conditions _ a weakening currency, shrinking economic growth _ that
threaten to devastate an economy. Other proposals would give debtor
countries the legal right to reschedule and postpone payments owed
to foreign banks and bondholders.
</P>
<P>
   Restricting lenders would solve another problem. It would
deflect criticism that the Clinton administration and the IMF, in
pushing through huge bailout loans for countries in crisis, are
using public money to repay lenders for risky credits they should
not have extended in the first place, or at least not in such
quantities. Such bailouts will only encourage excessive lending in
the future, this argument goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If lenders don't take a hit, they won't price their loans
correctly,'' said Robert Litan, a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution. ``They will set interest rates too low, and they will
shovel too much money into questionable markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposals to curb lending are coming increasingly from
international organizations, most of which bring together
representatives from industrial countries where the lenders are
located. One proposal, for example, would require or encourage
lenders to put aside, say, 9 cents or 10 cents for every dollar
lent to banks and businesses in high-risk countries. These are
amounts larger than the sums that are required to be put aside
today. With that extra money sitting idle, lenders would have to
increase their interest rates to earn as much as before _ and the
higher rates would inhibit lending.
</P>
<P>
   Another change would make it easier to renegotiate debt, much of
which is in the form of bonds sold to mutual funds, hedge funds,
wealthy investors and the like. Through a majority vote, for
example, these bondholders could agree to stretch out payments from
hard-pressed debtors in emerging countries. Currently, most bonds
agreements require a unanimous vote to do this.
</P>
<P>
   Still other proposals would put ceilings on short-term lending
in risky markets, or require lenders to take a loss on their loans
in the event of a crisis _ a ``haircut'' that Litan is pushing.
</P>
<P>
   Are any of these changes likely to be adopted and enforced?
Probably not, if the global crisis ends soon. Besides, there are
few mechanisms to enforce these rules across borders.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the global crisis endures, overcoming the resistance of
lenders will not be easy. Borrowers may also object, given the
likelihood that the various restrictions will require them to pay
higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is,'' Litan said, ``that no one wants to be the
first to make the necessary commitment.''

   NEW YORK _ It was spring when J. Geraldine Jackson first began
to feel the world closing in on her. It seemed as if she were
living in a cave inside her mind. She slept countless hours and
lost her job. Her heart raced. Sometimes her left leg went numb.
Her favorite television show, ``The Equalizer,'' a dark drama about
crime in Manhattan, no longer held its allure. Noise _ especially
laughter _ made her want to fight.
</P>
<P>
   It was a little smart talk from her sister that finally set her
off. She pummeled her sister with her fists, grabbed a pocketbook
and a change of clothes, and fled the housing project in the Bronx
where she lived with her mother. She landed in a homeless shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to go,'' Ms. Jackson, 39, recalled. ``I was really
beginning to lose it. I had lost it.''
</P>
<P>
   That day last May marked the final phase of her journey into
homelessness, which, she can now see, had begun more than a decade
ago. It took the doctors at the homeless shelter a few weeks to
give her problem a name: manic-depression.
</P>
<P>
   As mental-health experts learn more about mood disorders, it is
becoming clear that depression and manic-depression, with its wild
mood swings, are a significant cause of homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Homeless shelters have long been filled with schizophrenics,
people whose hallucinations and delusions force them out of jobs
and homes and relationships. But the link between depression and
homelessness is only now becoming clear.
</P>
<P>
   Much attention has been focused on depression and
manic-depression in recent years as a number of prominent _ and
well-off _ people have offered public accounts of their battles
with the diseases. In ``An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and
Madness (Vintage Books, 1995), Dr. Kay Redfield Jamison, a
psychiatrist, gave a moving portrait of her own battle with
manic-depression.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Wallace of ``60 Minutes'' did a segment on the program with
Art Buchwald in which they discussed their struggles with
depression. William Styron's memoir of his struggle with a deep
depression, ``Darkness Visible,'' became a best seller a few years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   But they all had safety nets, and they were brought back, some
from the brink of suicide, by expensive treatments and dutiful
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to get the best medical care possible,'' said Dr.
Jamison, a professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins School of
Medicine. Whenever she sees a homeless person, she thinks, ``There
but for the grace of God go I,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Jackson and others like her, there is no such safety
net. It is unclear how many others are in similar situations, but
Dr. Ronald Fieve, a pioneer in the use of lithium to treat
depression and manic-depression, said aggressive efforts to
identify homeless people with the disorders could significantly
reduce the population of homeless shelters.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are in a state of chronic illness that is
treatable,'' said Fieve, who has recruited homeless patients at
shelters for clinical studies of mood disorders.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, doctors say, manic-depression like Ms. Jackson's,
also known as bipolar disorder, responds to mood stabilizers like
lithium, Depakote and Tegretol, but diagnosing the disease can be a
formidable task because it can appear, in its later stages, like
schizophrenia. During the highs, manic-depressives can become
delusional, like schizophrenics. Because schizophrenia's symptoms
are easier to diagnose, emergency-room doctors and shelter
operators are much more likely to classify someone as schizophrenic
than manic-depressive.
</P>
<P>
   During the low points for manic-depressives, extreme fatigue is
common.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no desire to get going on anything, which means they
become burdens if they are living with anybody,'' Fieve said.
``They are not able to earn any money. If you work, you've probably
lost your job because of excessive absenteeism and poor
performance. If you are poor, this is where homelessness sets in.
Your family can't deal with you. So, you're out on the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jackson turned to cocaine in an attempt to quiet her demons.
It only made things worse, she said. And when the doctors did sort
out her problems, she said, they had difficulty treating her
manic-depression because of her drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the appropriate diagnosis and medication, the
complexities of manic-depression are such that patients live in
denial. Sometimes they stop taking their medicine when they start
to feel better, leaving them open to more intense episodes.
</P>
<P>
   On this point, and many others, Ms. Jackson's is a case study in
how manic-depressives can drift into homelessness and, if their
problem is recognized, reclaim their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The reclamation does not occur overnight, but comes in fits and
starts as Ms. Jackson's metamorphosis shows. Though it takes years
for some people to get the disease under control, it took her less
than a year. She was supervised closely by doctors who were
experienced in helping homeless manic-depressives.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jackson allowed a reporter to follow her on the journey,
which lasted about eight months, the length of her stay at a
homeless shelter for mentally ill women in lower Manhattan. She
permitted doctors and social workers to discuss her case with the
reporter because she wanted her story to help others.

manic-depression in recent years as a number of prominent _ and
well-off _ people have offered public accounts of their battles
with the diseases. In ``An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and
Madness (Vintage Books, 1995), Dr. Kay Redfield Jamison, a
psychiatrist, gave a moving portrait of her own battle with
manic-depression.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Wallace of ``60 Minutes'' did a segment on the program with
Art Buchwald in which they discussed their struggles with
depression. William Styron's memoir of his struggle with a deep
depression, ``Darkness Visible,'' became a best seller a few years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   But they all had safety nets, and they were brought back, some
from the brink of suicide, by expensive treatments and dutiful
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to get the best medical care possible,'' said Dr.
Jamison, a professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins School of
Medicine. Whenever she sees a homeless person, she thinks, ``There
but for the grace of God go I,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Jackson and others like her, there is no such safety
net. It is unclear how many others are in similar situations, but
Dr. Ronald Fieve, a pioneer in the use of lithium to treat
depression and manic-depression, said aggressive efforts to
identify homeless people with the disorders could significantly
reduce the population of homeless shelters.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are in a state of chronic illness that is
treatable,'' said Fieve, who has recruited homeless patients at
shelters for clinical studies of mood disorders.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, doctors say, manic-depression like Ms. Jackson's,
also known as bipolar disorder, responds to mood stabilizers like
lithium, Depakote and Tegretol, but diagnosing the disease can be a
formidable task because it can appear, in its later stages, like
schizophrenia. During the highs, manic-depressives can become
delusional, like schizophrenics. Because schizophrenia's symptoms
are easier to diagnose, emergency-room doctors and shelter
operators are much more likely to classify someone as schizophrenic
than manic-depressive.
</P>
<P>
   During the low points for manic-depressives, extreme fatigue is
common.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no desire to get going on anything, which means they
become burdens if they are living with anybody,'' Fieve said.
``They are not able to earn any money. If you work, you've probably
lost your job because of excessive absenteeism and poor
performance. If you are poor, this is where homelessness sets in.
Your family can't deal with you. So, you're out on the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jackson turned to cocaine in an attempt to quiet her demons.
It only made things worse, she said. And when the doctors did sort
out her problems, she said, they had difficulty treating her
manic-depression because of her drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the appropriate diagnosis and medication, the
complexities of manic-depression are such that patients live in
denial. Sometimes they stop taking their medicine when they start
to feel better, leaving them open to more intense episodes.
</P>
<P>
   On this point, and many others, Ms. Jackson's is a case study in
how manic-depressives can drift into homelessness and, if their
problem is recognized, reclaim their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The reclamation does not occur overnight, but comes in fits and
starts as Ms. Jackson's metamorphosis shows. Though it takes years
for some people to get the disease under control, it took her less
than a year. She was supervised closely by doctors who were
experienced in helping homeless manic-depressives.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jackson allowed a reporter to follow her on the journey,
which lasted about eight months, the length of her stay at a
homeless shelter for mentally ill women in lower Manhattan. She
permitted doctors and social workers to discuss her case with the
reporter because she wanted her story to help others.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The first meeting with Ms. Jackson occurred last June, after her
third week at the shelter. Angry and suspicious, she believed she
had been misdiagnosed. She wore a billowy denim dress and tried to
hide behind huge sunglasses and a sun hat.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke in fragments, but she made two things clear. She
wanted a home for herself and her 13-year-old son, Timothy, who is
living with her father during her recovery. And she was sick, she
said, but not in the head. She had heart palpitations, a headache
and a sharp pain that charged up and down her left leg.
</P>
<P>
   During several meetings in June, the signs of depression
lingered. The headaches, palpitations and leg pain persisted. Once
styling spray from her short curly hair dripped into her eyes and
slid down the sides of her face. She didn't notice. A hallmark of
depression is the loss of concern about one's appearance.
</P>
<P>
   But by July, the transformation was dramatic. The headaches,
heart palpitations and leg pain had disappeared. Depression can
sometimes cause unexplained pain, said Dr. David Nardacci, who had
first prescribed a combination of mood stabilizers, antidepressants
and sleeping pills for her. Later, she was stabilized on a new
combination of mood elevators and antidepressants, including
Wellbutrin and Tegretol, and taken off the sleeping pills.
</P>
<P>
   No longer irritable, she was talkative and energetic. A
toothless smile had replaced the vacant stares and the darting
glances. She wore her short curly hair pinned back.
</P>
<P>
   She even chatted with a security guard at the front desk of the
shelter and joked with other residents as she left for an outing.
Over a dinner of steamy pasta at a trendy downtown restaurant, she
talked about reconnecting with her family and living drug-free.
</P>
<P>
   And she ruminated about how manic-depression can ruin a person's
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe I didn't think I had this,'' she said of
manic-depression. ``It's so obvious to me now.''
</P>
<P>
   She was ready, she thought, to go back to work. But her
counselors urged her to take one day at a time. She had been fired
in March 1997 from her clerical job at an insurance office because
of excessive absenteeism, a symptom of her disease. She talked
about wanting to repair her credit, which was ruined years ago by
wild spending sprees during manic phases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I made this move,'' she said of her entry into the
shelter system. ``If I had done it sooner, things wouldn't be so
bad now. I would have been able to save my job. I would have had my
own house. I could have been in school. I could have had a car and
credit cards. I would have been able to save a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeling better than she had in 20 years, Ms. Jackson left the
shelter last month and moved into assisted housing on Manhattan's
Lower East Side. She signed up to live there for two years, she
said, but she plans to be out in about seven months. She wants to
become an addictions counselor.
</P>
<P>
   Because new symptoms of anxiety and depression had flared up a
few months ago, Nardacci added lithium to Ms. Jackson's daily dose
of medications. The pills are in part responsible for a 30-pound
weight gain, but Ms. Jackson was unfazed.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a yellow turtleneck and tweed pants, her hair swept
up into a beehive, Ms. Jackson was happy yet apprehensive about
leaving the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Her next stop, Los Vecinos on Pitt Street, is geared toward
mentally ill people with substance abuse problems and offers
counseling and psychiatric treatment, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   The services at Los Vecinos are much like those offered at the
shelter, but Ms. Jackson has her own room instead of a cubicle. She
shares a common space with two other women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wake up to whatever the plan is for that day,'' she said.
``I have no baggage from the day before. I can deal with things.
That's a big plus. It is so awesome that I can deal with things
that used to grip me for days.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM _ Henk Prijt can still hear the groan of the engines
and the thunderous clap that changed his life one Sunday evening in
October 1992, just before dinner time. Outside his windows, the
world had turned red: a wrecked plane was on fire, a large
apartment block was ablaze, human beings ran like living torches
and screams came from everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Prijt stayed on the site of the disaster for hours, pulling
people from smoke-filled apartments, carrying some of the wounded
and helping firemen haul debris.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, the 49-year-old metalworker first fell ill with
skin ailments, joint pains and breathing problems that persist
today, more than six years after an El Al cargo plane lost two
engines and lurched into a low-income housing complex in southern
Amsterdam. Forty-three people died on the ground, some 80
apartments were destroyed, and another 150 were damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Prijt and more than 1,100 other rescue workers and residents
believe they were somehow contaminated that night by the burning
aircraft, or its mysterious cargo _ first described by El Al as
``perfumes and machine parts'' and finally revealed last October to
include vats of chemicals that can be used in the manufacture of
the deadly nerve gas Sarin.
</P>
<P>
   That revelation prompted the Dutch Parliament to launch its
first formal inquiry into the crash, which had occurred shortly
after the Boeing 747 took off from Amsterdam's airport en route to
Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, begun last November, is expected to hear some
70 witnesses, drawing together the reports of illness and
allegations of a cover-up by El Al and the Dutch government that
have inflamed public passions here for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel manipulated; they trust nobody any more,'' said
Bob van der Goen, a lawyer representing relatives of crash victims
who have sought damages from Boeing and El Al.``They want no more
evasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Even today, the mystery of the plane's cargo is not solved. When
it was revealed by the newspaper NRC Handelsblad last October that
elements needed to make Sarin were on board, the Israeli government
said the chemicals were destined for the Institute for Biological
Research in Ness Ziona, south of Tel Aviv, whose work is secret.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a further 20 tons of the 114-ton cargo are unidentified, and
the relevant travel documents are missing. El Al has said this
cargo was destined for the Israeli Ministry of Defense but it
cannot disclose its nature for ``reasons of national security.'' An
Israeli Defense Ministry spokesman has said the freight consigned
to the ministry did not include dangerous goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you treat people if you have no idea what they were
exposed to,'' said Nizaar Makdoembaks, a physician whose family
practice in the area includes numerous patients who believe their
ailments are linked to some kind of chemical exposure or radiation.
``People cannot prove anything, but the fear and the panic worsens
their stress.''
</P>
<P>
   The parliamentary commission wants to know why El Al at first
refused to hand over any waybills, and what was the role of Israeli
security agents who appeared at the site in protective gear within
an hour after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Did they take the cockpit voice recorder, the black box, which
is missing, or the plane's documents, which rescuers retrieved from
the cockpit, but then disappeared? What is the agreement between
the Dutch government and Israeli security and intelligence
officials, who are often seen at Amsterdam's airport?
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch government has produced several reports, but never
answered all the nagging questions.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 2, parliamentary investigators were astonished to hear a
tape recorded a half-hour after the crash in which an El Al
employee tells an Amsterdam airport traffic controller that the
cargo included explosives, ammunition, toxic materials, gases and
inflammable goods. The El Al employee asks to keep the information
quiet, and the traffic controller is heard agreeing.
</P>
<P>
   The current transport minister, Tineke Netelenbos, has supported
Parliament's inquiry, saying that ``it is important that we
establish quickly which materials from the plane were burned, at
what temperature and what consequence they have on public health.''
</P>
<P>
   Police and firefighters who were at the crash site, which was
crowded for four days, said the air was filled with a lethal
cocktail, including burning kerosene, plastics and cargo from the
plane and smoldering asbestos from the ruined apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Medical and other specialists are now stressing the dangers of
depleted uranium, used as ballast in the plane's tail. In the
1980s, Boeing advised clients to discontinue use of depleted
uranium. But Israel did not make the change in a number of its
planes.
</P>
<P>
   Depleted uranium burns at high temperatures and can get into the
air as dangerous dust. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration
says that depleted uranium must be handled only by people wearing
special protection. While this uranium emits only low-level
radiation, the warning suggests it is carcinogenic because
particles in contact with the skin or inhaled or digested can cause
lasting radiation of tissue.
</P>
<P>
   During the cleanup, some 300 pounds of the plane's depleted
uranium was never accounted for and may have burned. Laboratory
tests done last year on 15 people who were near the crash site
found four samples with high uranium content.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Elly Prijt, 44, who has mysterious black scars on
her neck and her legs, as though someone stubbed out cigarettes on
her skin. After the crash, she had joined her husband in helping
victims. ``I'm exhausted and I'm getting different infections all
the time,'' she said recently.
</P>
<P>
   At Amsterdam's University Hospital, a team offers people who
were at the crash site counseling for psychological problems, which
may be at the root of some of the physical ailments. Last June, at
the government's request, the team also asked people who had been
at the site to report unexplained illnesses. More than 1,100 people
responded, reporting sleeplessness and fatigue, pain in their
joints, and respiratory problems, said Joris Ijzermans, the
physician who heads the team.
</P>
<P>
   The government has said that a full physical check-up of all the
victims was too much to undertake.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL CUT)
</P>
<P>
   Maria Herts says she has been short of breath since the crash,
which happened just a few hundred yards from where she lived, and
killed her sister and brother-in-law. Boeing and El Al, which have
paid undisclosed damages to an unknown number of crash victims _
and made them sign a secrecy clause _ have not yet paid the damages
for Ms. Herts' young nephew. ( END OPTIONAL CUT)
</P>
<P>
   ``All this has been dragging on for too long, the claims, the
unexamined illnesses,'' said van der Goen, the lawyer. ``It's
scandalous that such a thing can happen in a European country.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What would happen if the government were investing
hundreds of billions of dollars of Social Security reserves in the
stock market, and the anti-abortion forces in Congress decided that
none of it should be put into companies that make or import pills
that induce abortion?
</P>
<P>
   Playing politics with the Social Security reserves would be
quite unpopular. But companies that might want to put abortion
pills on the market could hardly afford the risk that their stocks
would be off limits to maybe the biggest single investor in the
world. So it's a safe bet that any plans to put the pills on sale
would be shelved.
</P>
<P>
   That is the kind of nightmare foreseen by the economists and
politicians who oppose President Clinton's plan to beef up Social
Security reserves by investing some of the money in stocks.
Political tampering, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned
Congress in January, could ``put at risk the efficiency of our
capital markets and thus our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and conservative economists oppose the Clinton plan
because they fear government intrusion in the markets. But most of
them would also divert Social Security money into stocks. Under
various proposals, all workers would be allowed to take some of the
money they would otherwise pay in taxes and invest it in stocks
that would go into their own private investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But these plans are fraught with potential problems, too, the
most serious being the possibility that workers could lose some of
their retirement savings through bad investments or a drop in the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are trying to take advantage of a simple fact of
economic history: Over a long period of time, private stocks have
earned much more money for investors than the government bonds
where by law the Social Security reserves are now held. Economists
project the average annual return on stocks over the next 75 years
to be 6 percent to 7 percent more than the rate of inflation,
compared with an average of less than 3 percent above inflation for
government bonds.
</P>
<P>
   This is important because every additional dollar investments
earn for retirement is one less dollar the government will have to
raise for Social Security through higher taxes or reduced benefits
when the baby boomers begin to retire early in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue is more a matter of politics and ideology than of
economics. Most of the advocates on both sides _ those who want the
government to control the investments and those who want workers to
invest the money themselves _ would rather leave the Social
Security system as it is now with its lower return on investments
than take what they see as the unacceptable risks of the other
side's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Under President Clinton's plan, nearly $600 billion, or 15
percent of the Social Security trust fund, would be invested in
stocks between now and 2015. Counting dividends and inflation, the
government would then own about $1 trillion in stock, nearly 4
percent of all the outstanding public stock in the country.
</P>
<P>
   A strict firewall would be built to protect this investment from
political meddling. Management would be placed in the hands of an
independent board whose members would serve long, staggered terms
and not be subject to removal for political reasons. Investments
could be made only in broad index funds, not in individual stocks.
The government's voting rights on its shares would be restricted,
and the managers would be required to vote shares solely according
to the economic interest of the beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The president and his economic advisers argue that the
management board would be every bit as insulated from politics as
the Federal Reserve Board. And they say the experience of state
pension funds and the Thrift Savings Plan for federal workers shows
that public pension money can be invested in the stock market
without political interference.
</P>
<P>
   But critics point out that over the years, the Federal Reserve
has often been subjected to political arm twisting. (The Nixon
White House, for example, leaned heavily on Fed Chairman Arthur
Burns to see that the economy was especially strong in 1972 when
Nixon ran for re-election. Burns denied it, but many historians are
now convinced that he manipulated monetary policy to that effect.)
</P>
<P>
   Any firewall that Congress builds, the critics note, Congress
can also tear down with one vote.
</P>
<P>
   As for state and local pension funds, they have generally
avoided political tampering, but there are countless exceptions.
Pension funds in California and Illinois have been required to
contribute money to offset state budget deficits. Funds in
Pennsylvania and Connecticut recently lost millions of dollars
because politicians insisted they make investments to keep or
attract job-producing businesses in those states. In the 1970s and
1980s, more than half the state legislatures prohibited their
retirement funds from being invested in companies that did business
in South Africa. Pension funds in four states _ Florida,
Massachusetts, Minnesota and Vermont _ have been required to sell
their stock in tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrift Savings Plan has indeed been free of politics. But
with assets of about $70 billion, its portfolio is much smaller
than Social Security's would be. In addition, unlike Social
Security, participation is voluntary for Federal workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pension fund money is lusted after by politicians of both
parties,'' said Richard Koppes, former general counsel of the
California Public Employees' Retirement System. ``They can't resist
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Allowing workers to invest part of their retirement money
themselves, as most Republicans want to do, avoids most of the
political problems, but it raises others. Most Americans are not
sophisticated about finance and could be victimized by unscrupulous
sales pitches. In 1988, when Britain allowed workers to opt out of
the public pension system and invest in private accounts, many
people lost billions of dollars to scam artists in what was called
the ``mis-selling'' scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that markets are not always strong. The
decade of the 1970s, for example, was not good for stocks. Adjusted
for inflation, the average portfolio did not reach its 1969 level,
even with dividends reinvested, until 1983. A huge government
portfolio could smooth the peaks and valleys, but private investors
could lose a large part of their retirement savings in a bear
market.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, small accounts would be expensive to administer, and a
sizable chunk of workers' savings could go to administrative fees.
According to Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur
Levitt Jr., a 1 percent annual fee, for instance, reduces an
account's balance by 17 percent after 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, since almost everyone in politics wants to put some of
the money in the stock market one way or another, perhaps the
president and Congress will decide that the reward is worth the
risks. The division between the two sides over how to invest the
Social Security money is so sharp, though, that a compromise will
be difficult. But the attraction of finding a way to minimize tax
increases and benefit cuts is mighty strong.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What would happen if the government were investing
hundreds of billions of dollars of Social Security reserves in the
stock market, and the anti-abortion forces in Congress decided that
none of it should be put into companies that make or import pills
that induce abortion?
</P>
<P>
   Playing politics with the Social Security reserves would be
quite unpopular. But companies that might want to put abortion
pills on the market could hardly afford the risk that their stocks
would be off limits to maybe the biggest single investor in the
world. So it's a safe bet that any plans to put the pills on sale
would be shelved.
</P>
<P>
   That is the kind of nightmare foreseen by the economists and
politicians who oppose President Clinton's plan to beef up Social
Security reserves by investing some of the money in stocks.
Political tampering, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned
Congress in January, could ``put at risk the efficiency of our
capital markets and thus our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and conservative economists oppose the Clinton plan
because they fear government intrusion in the markets. But most of
them would also divert Social Security money into stocks. Under
various proposals, all workers would be allowed to take some of the
money they would otherwise pay in taxes and invest it in stocks
that would go into their own private investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But these plans are fraught with potential problems, too, the
most serious being the possibility that workers could lose some of
their retirement savings through bad investments or a drop in the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are trying to take advantage of a simple fact of
economic history: Over a long period of time, private stocks have
earned much more money for investors than the government bonds
where by law the Social Security reserves are now held. Economists
project the average annual return on stocks over the next 75 years
to be 6 percent to 7 percent more than the rate of inflation,
compared with an average of less than 3 percent above inflation for
government bonds.
</P>
<P>
   This is important because every additional dollar investments
earn for retirement is one less dollar the government will have to
raise for Social Security through higher taxes or reduced benefits
when the baby boomers begin to retire early in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue is more a matter of politics and ideology than of
economics. Most of the advocates on both sides _ those who want the
government to control the investments and those who want workers to
invest the money themselves _ would rather leave the Social
Security system as it is now with its lower return on investments
than take what they see as the unacceptable risks of the other
side's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Under President Clinton's plan, nearly $600 billion, or 15
percent of the Social Security trust fund, would be invested in
stocks between now and 2015. Counting dividends and inflation, the
government would then own about $1 trillion in stock, nearly 4
percent of all the outstanding public stock in the country.
</P>
<P>
   A strict firewall would be built to protect this investment from
political meddling. Management would be placed in the hands of an
independent board whose members would serve long, staggered terms
and not be subject to removal for political reasons. Investments
could be made only in broad index funds, not in individual stocks.
The government's voting rights on its shares would be restricted,
and the managers would be required to vote shares solely according
to the economic interest of the beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The president and his economic advisers argue that the
management board would be every bit as insulated from politics as
the Federal Reserve Board. And they say the experience of state
pension funds and the Thrift Savings Plan for federal workers shows
that public pension money can be invested in the stock market
without political interference.
</P>
<P>
   But critics point out that over the years, the Federal Reserve
has often been subjected to political arm twisting. (The Nixon
White House, for example, leaned heavily on Fed Chairman Arthur
Burns to see that the economy was especially strong in 1972 when
Nixon ran for re-election. Burns denied it, but many historians are
now convinced that he manipulated monetary policy to that effect.)
</P>
<P>
   Any firewall that Congress builds, the critics note, Congress
can also tear down with one vote.
</P>
<P>
   As for state and local pension funds, they have generally
avoided political tampering, but there are countless exceptions.
Pension funds in California and Illinois have been required to
contribute money to offset state budget deficits. Funds in
Pennsylvania and Connecticut recently lost millions of dollars
because politicians insisted they make investments to keep or
attract job-producing businesses in those states. In the 1970s and
1980s, more than half the state legislatures prohibited their
retirement funds from being invested in companies that did business
in South Africa. Pension funds in four states _ Florida,
Massachusetts, Minnesota and Vermont _ have been required to sell
their stock in tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrift Savings Plan has indeed been free of politics. But
with assets of about $70 billion, its portfolio is much smaller
than Social Security's would be. In addition, unlike Social
Security, participation is voluntary for Federal workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pension fund money is lusted after by politicians of both
parties,'' said Richard Koppes, former general counsel of the
California Public Employees' Retirement System. ``They can't resist
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Allowing workers to invest part of their retirement money
themselves, as most Republicans want to do, avoids most of the
political problems, but it raises others. Most Americans are not
sophisticated about finance and could be victimized by unscrupulous
sales pitches. In 1988, when Britain allowed workers to opt out of
the public pension system and invest in private accounts, many
people lost billions of dollars to scam artists in what was called
the ``mis-selling'' scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that markets are not always strong. The
decade of the 1970s, for example, was not good for stocks. Adjusted
for inflation, the average portfolio did not reach its 1969 level,
even with dividends reinvested, until 1983. A huge government
portfolio could smooth the peaks and valleys, but private investors
could lose a large part of their retirement savings in a bear
market.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, small accounts would be expensive to administer, and a
sizable chunk of workers' savings could go to administrative fees.
According to Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur
Levitt Jr., a 1 percent annual fee, for instance, reduces an
account's balance by 17 percent after 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, since almost everyone in politics wants to put some of
the money in the stock market one way or another, perhaps the
president and Congress will decide that the reward is worth the
risks. The division between the two sides over how to invest the
Social Security money is so sharp, though, that a compromise will
be difficult. But the attraction of finding a way to minimize tax
increases and benefit cuts is mighty strong.

<P>
   When it comes to nominating presidential candidates, Louisiana
and Delaware don't like to play by the rules that have
traditionally governed this quadrennial rite. Of all the states
that in recent years have tried to gain nominating clout by moving
up the dates of their caucuses and primaries, these two have been
the boldest and most aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, Iowa claimed the right to hold the nation's
first caucuses, usually scheduling them in late February or early
March. But in 1996, Louisiana Republicans ignored that claim and
scheduled their caucuses first. Party leaders said a few days ago
that come Election 2000, Louisiana plans to be out front again.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, for many years New Hampshire claimed the right to hold
the nation's first primary, always scheduling it just after Iowa's
caucuses and a full week before primary voting in any other state.
But in 1996, Delaware horned in and grabbed some of the early
nominating glory by holding its primary just four days after New
Hampshire had voted. And come Election 2000, Delaware has plans to
once again vote right on New Hampshire's heels.
</P>
<P>
   But Iowa and New Hampshire are fighting back in this new War
Between the States.
</P>
<P>
   As they did in 1996, election officials in both states vow they
will move up their voting dates as often as necessary to preserve
their first-in-the-nation status, though they acknowledge that such
action could set off a mad rescheduling competition and might
violate some national party regulations. These officials are also
demanding, as they did in 1996, that announced and prospective
candidates pledge to ignore Louisiana and Delaware. Further, they
warn that candidates who refuse to take the pledge might be
punished by slighted voters in Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   That threat scared many candidates away from Louisiana and
Delaware in 1996 and sharply reduced the impact of their
beat-you-to-the-polls votes. And this time around the threat is
again bringing in some pledges.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, a probable candidate, sent pledge
letters last week to party officials in both Iowa and New
Hampshire, saying that those states must be allowed to go first in
the presidential nominating process because they are small and
manageable enough to afford ``every campaign a fair hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The grand tradition of American politics, where every
candidate is given the same chance, must be preserved,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Another aspirant, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., also has made a
pledge, telling New Hampshire officials last weekend that he was
committed to preserving the state's first-in-the-nation primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will do everything in my power,'' he said. ``I will not
campaign in Delaware.''
</P>
<P>
   McCAIN RETHINKS THE ARIZONA PRIMARY
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to when his own state should hold its primary in
2000, McCain has recently had some second thoughts _ curious second
thoughts, his critics say.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he supported a decision by the Arizona Legislature to
leapfrog the primary date several months ahead, to mid-February,
apparently calculating that the shift not only would give the state
more influence in the nominating process but would also provide his
favorite candidate, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, with an early
opportunity to build momentum (a moot calculation as things turned
out, because Gramm was out of the race by the time Arizonans went
to the polls).
</P>
<P>
   Now, for Election 2000, in which he must think of his own
candidacy, McCain favors moving back the date of the primary, to
March 14.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that many of the state's cities and towns have scheduled
local elections for that day, he argues that holding a primary in
mid-February and local elections a month later would be a costly
inconvenience for voters. Better to consolidate the elections on
March 14, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of two other White House aspirants, former Vice
President Dan Quayle and Steve Forbes, the publisher, question that
reasoning. Pointing out that Quayle now lives in Arizona and that
Forbes won the primary there in 1996, they contend that McCain
faces the possibility of serious political trouble, maybe even
defeat, in the 2000 Arizona primary and wants to postpone it until
after March 7.
</P>
<P>
   That day will be the biggest of the year for primaries, the
Super Tuesday of Super Tuesdays, with about a dozen states
scheduled to vote, including California and New York. No candidate
wants to go into it burdened with the embarrassment of a bad
performance in an earlier home state primary.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, most of Arizona's Republican leaders, including those
in the Republican-dominated Legislature, have refused to go along
with McCain on moving the primary back to March 14.
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough, McCain said the other day, adding, ``Early, later
or medium, I can beat anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   THIS TIME AROUND, OUTRAGE DIDN'T MATTER
</P>
<P>
   Remember Dr. Fay Boozman, the ophthalmologist who was the
unsuccessful Republican candidate in last year's U.S. Senate race
in Arkansas?
</P>
<P>
   In one campaign appearance, he said he was a strong opponent of
abortion, except in cases of rape, incest and when the life of the
mother was threatened. But he argued that abortion was mostly a
moot issue insofar as rape was concerned because, he said, the
stress of the assault triggered a biochemical reaction in the
victim that made conception unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Women's groups were outraged and many medical authorities shook
their heads in wonderment. And after the election, when Arkansas
Gov. Mike Huckabee, a conservative Republican, said he planned to
appoint Boozman as director of the state's Department of Health,
there was a firestorm of protest, with 11 women in the Legislature
declaring him unqualified for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the governor made the appointment. It is not subject
to legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   PACKWOOD SPEAKS TO PAPER, KIND OF
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Bob Packwood, the former Republican senator from
Oregon, has had his differences with that state's leading
newspaper, The Oregonian of Portland. In fact, in the four years
since he resigned from the Senate after its Ethics Committee found
him guilty of sexual harassment, a story given heavy play by the
paper, Packwood has refused all requests by its reporters for an
interview _ until the other day.
</P>
<P>
   Then, according to Wednesday's Oregonian, he left the following
voice mail for Jim Barnett, a reporter:
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Bob Packwood. I got your call yesterday. It's
Thursday, 7 o'clock. As you're aware, Jim, my policy hasn't
changed. But if you would like a quote, it's the same one I gave
you the other day, and I'm curious to see if The Oregonian will use
it. Quote: Since I quit talking to The Oregonian, my business has
prospered beyond all measure. I assume my business has prospered
because I don't talk to The Oregonian. Therefore I will continue
that policy. Unquote. Thanks.''

 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Ask Republican presidential prospects about the biggest
issue facing their party _ whether President Clinton should be
convicted by the Senate _ and you'll probably get something short
of a direct answer.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Kasich of Ohio: ``I don't want to get into dictating
to the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Bush of Texas: ``This person has embarrassed us and
the Senate needs to do what it does.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona: ``I hold the quaint notion that I'm
a juror _ and jurors wait until after the trial to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee: ``Let the senators
decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has ducked the question. Some contenders, including
Steve Forbes, the publishing magnate, and former Vice President Dan
Quayle, have called for Clinton to be convicted. But in their
barnstorming tours through early primary states like New Hampshire,
even those candidates have been careful, especially recently, not
to make the subject a centerpiece of their speeches. Mostly, they
discuss the matter only when quizzed by reporters.
</P>
<P>
   This reluctance to weigh in enthusiastically _ or at all _ on an
issue that has so dominated American politics and consumed
Republicans in Congress underscores their party's ambivalence about
how impeachment is playing politically.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, it would be understandable for candidates to
condemn Clinton and press for his ouster because many conservatives
who are influential in the primaries favor that position. On the
other hand, polls show that Republicans, even conservatives,
increasingly worry that impeachment may hover over their party like
a mushroom cloud that could damage them in the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, most Republican prospects for president expressed
their deep disapproval, even disgust, with Clinton. But they also
made clear that they were wrestling with how to handle what hardly
seemed a winning issue. Clearly, they do not want impeachment to
define their candidacies _ or risk being identified as prime movers
behind what some voters already claim is a partisan witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
   If voters in 2000 are still critical of the Republican Party's
handling of impeachment, candidates who are now outspoken on the
matter could be particularly vulnerable. Those who are keeping a
low profile may be tempted to campaign next year against what they
could describe as an impeachment-obsessed Congress, even one now
controlled by their own party.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I ducked the issue, there might be a temporary political
advantage because even among a lot of Republicans this is not very
popular,'' said Forbes, who sought the nomination in 1996. ``But I
feel you've got to put it on the table. You've got to explain the
way you feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes usually condemns Clinton's behavior in his speeches but
lately he has dwelled more on the Republicans' failure to respond
with a full agenda of issues. Asked what the Senate should do, he
said: ``Given the man's abuses of office _ which go far beyond the
Monica business _ they have a duty to go through with the trial.
And if I were a senator, I would vote to convict.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle also declares forcefully that the Senate should remove
Clinton from office. In a speech in Indianapolis this week, he
repeated what had become a stock anecdote. ``Think of this,'' he
said. ``The day Bill Clinton was impeached by the House of
Representatives, Al Gore, in the Rose Garden of the White House,
stands before the world and says, `Bill Clinton is one of America's
greatest presidents.' We have a different interpretation of what
integrity is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle explained that he, too, thought the Senate should convict
Clinton, saying, ``I think perjury is clearly in the category of
high crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, a prominent religious conservative, also hammers
away at Clinton and asserts that he should be forced from office.
``He could salvage his place in history by turning the presidency
over to Al Gore,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   But even those remarks are not nearly as harsh as the scathing
attacks on Clinton after the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke.
</P>
<P>
   At a Republican gathering in Biloxi, Miss., a year ago, Forbes
described the ``shadiness and sordidness that we have in the White
House today.'' At the same event, Quayle called the scandal a
``disgusting situation'' and mockingly put forward an anti-crime
proposal that he described as ``three interns _ and you're out!''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander was one of the first contenders to call for Clinton to
resign _ and said he would vote for impeachment in the House _ but
has been mum on what the Senate should do.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Reed, who ran Bob Dole's presidential campaign in 1996,
said, ``In the beginning, everyone thought this guy was going to be
gone in 72 hours.'' But the president's approval rating has
remained strong. ``That says something to these candidates and
their campaigns,'' Reed said. ``It says that they ought to leave
this alone.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why Kasich, when asked how often in his political
speeches he brought up his House vote to impeach Clinton, said:
``Virtually, not at all. I do talk about the notion that our
big-time leaders have to be more selfless. But renewing the spirit
of America is not about what the president did. It's about what a
president could do in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Kasich would not take a stand on what the Senate should
do, he said, ``I believe these are impeachable and removable
offenses.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, who is considering a run for the nomination,
said through a spokeswoman that she would have no comment about
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican candidates, declared or undeclared, were willing
to go as far as others in their party and predict that impeachment
could damage their party's prospects in 2000. Bush, for one, said
he expected that people would be no more interested in the matter
than they are now. ``I don't think the attitudes of the American
people and the political landscape and environment is going to be
much different than it is today,'' he said. ``People want to look
forward, not backward.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Republicans should worry about the political
fallout, Alexander said: ``We should be concerned about that, but
that shouldn't affect how senators vote. Senators should vote their
conscience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an idea that once this is all over, the country will
render a verdict,'' he added. ``And I think it will be a verdict
against Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Gore, of course, has stood loyally in
defense of the president. Former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey,
who is also seeking the nomination, has not been reluctant to
criticize Clinton. But, like many Republicans, he has not made the
issue a central theme. And unlike most Republicans, he asserts that
the president should not be thrown out of office.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the president did is wrong, and anytime a president lies
it erodes his credibility and the authority of the office,''
Bradley said. ``However, I don't believe that what President
Clinton is accused of rises to the level of high crimes and
misdemeanors, and therefore don't believe he should be convicted.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Almost from the moment he was elected to the
House of Representatives, James Rogan was singled out by fellow
Republicans as the freshman most likely to become a star.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan had become California's youngest judge at age 33 in 1990,
majority leader in the State Assembly in his first term, in 1996,
and a congressman in 1997. He so impressed Republican House leaders
that they waived their seniority rules and appointed him to two
high-profile committees: Commerce and Judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as one of the 13 House prosecutors trying to persuade the
Senate to remove President Clinton from office, Rogan, 41, has
greater name recognition in his second term than many of his
colleagues do after decades in office. But it is this starring role
in the president's impeachment trial that has put Rogan on the
Democratic Party's short list of Republicans from moderate
districts who are most likely to suffer a voter backlash in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Rogan is done,'' said Art Torres, chairman of the
California Democratic Party. ``People didn't really know him until
this impeachment issue. He had painted himself as a moderate. Now,
he has been exposed as the far-right zealot he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans counter that the impeachment issue will be dead by
2000, when the president will not be eligible to run again anyway.
Michael Schroeder, chairman of the California Republican Party,
dismisses the Democrats' predictions of a backlash as ``wishful
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years is an eternity in politics,'' Schroeder said. ``To
assume that the voters are going to take revenge when the president
will be out of office is just not reasonable.'' Besides, he added,
the Democrats could not beat Rogan in November, in the best
election year they have had in California since 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the impeachment issue, Rogan's district would have
been a battleground in 2000. The 27th Congressional District, which
runs along the San Gabriel Mountains from Burbank and Glendale
through Pasadena and San Marino, is in transition. Registered
Democrats now hold the majority over Republicans in these Los
Angeles suburbs by 44 to 39 percent. In November, Rogan was barely
re-elected, with 50.8 percent of the vote, over an unknown whom he
outspent two-to-one.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats assert that polls they have conducted show that a
substantial number of voters in Rogan's district are less likely to
vote for him again because of his stance on impeachment. Later this
month the Democrats plan a voter registration drive in a handful of
swing districts where disenchantment with impeachment is at a
crest, and Rogan's is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan, who has been inundated with calls, e-mail and letters,
the majority of them anti-impeachment, is well aware of the
ramifications of his position, said his press secretary, Jeffrey
Solsby. ``It's one thing to lose an election,'' Solsby said. ``It's
another thing to compromise your conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Zarian, a city councilman in Rogan's home base of Glendale
who hosts a nightly conservative talk show, argued that support for
him was overwhelming, ``and not just from conservatives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven out of 10 people I talk to on the street believe that
the president should be thrown out,'' he said. ``I don't know about
those polls, but I've seen the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveys of public opinion show that most people want the
impeachment trial to end soon, and with the president's acquittal.
That sentiment seemed to prevail with some people who took time
from shopping here to speak with a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I see Rogan on TV, I want to scream,'' said Kathy
Murphy, 28, a registered independent who did not vote in the last
election but said she planned to next time. ``I thought by not
voting, it would show how turned off I am to the whole political
process. Now I think that throwing the rascal out is a better
idea.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, John Mack, 46, a Republican, said he was glad
that Rogan had ``stuck to his conservative guns.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton is a moral disgrace to the entire world,'' Mack said.
</P>
<P>
   Cara Weinstein, a 36-year-old Democrat, said she had friends who
were already planning to contribute to whoever Rogan's next
opponent might be.
</P>
<P>
   She and her friends are not alone. The likely Democratic
contenders for the seat, state Sen. Adam Schiff of Burbank and
state Assemblyman Jack Scott of Pasadena, both say they have
received a barrage of calls and letters from voters and party
leaders asking them to run.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan's appearance in the spotlight has had its benefits, his
press secretary said, including an instance the other day when the
White House sought advance notice of the House prosecutors'
strategy. Rogan, quoting a former California judge, responded,
``It's none of your damn business what the other side is going to
put on.''
</P>
<P>
   The telephone rang off the hook in his office. By 10-to-one,
Solsby said, ``The callers said they were proud.''

   Monica Lewinsky, America's most famous intern, has certainly
learned many tough lessons in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, she's not the only bright-eyed intern dealt a
rude awakening by the realities of office sex, intrigue, power
politics or just plain bad workplace behavior. Consider what
happens to young pups in, say, the world of journalism, the
profession chronicling the Lewinsky saga.
</P>
<P>
   I know, because as a New York University journalism professor I
regularly sent my students out on newspaper, TV and radio
internships, and they reported back to me. Below are selected
entries from the weekly internship logs kept by my students over
the last few years. Taken together, their experiences could be a
syllabus for a course in the school of hard knocks.
</P>
<P>
   _ RICHARD PETROW
</P>
<P>
   INTERN ASSIGNMENT: Production assistant for national TV talk
show originating in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   RUDE AWAKENING: The intern is sexually harassed by a producer,
but gets a new internship after a complaint is lodged against the
offender.
</P>
<P>
   Log entry No. 1: J., the producer, kept telling me how great I
looked, and asked me out for a drink, and kept calling me ``Babe.''
I guess I know what interns are thought to be in that office. I'm
not interested in sleeping my way up the journalistic ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Log entry No. 2: J., the producer, cornered me in the lobby of
the building and kissed me on the mouth and called me ``a sweet
mushroom.'' Professor, is this sexual harassment?
</P>
<P>
   Log entry No. 3: J., the producer, asked if I dyed my pubic
hair, and when I said, ``Pardon me?!'' he unzipped his fly and
threatened to show me his.
</P>
<P>
   INTERN ASSIGNMENT: Production assistant for a network TV news
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   RUDE AWAKENING: Not only was the intern just a go-fer, but she
had to pay out of her own pocket for what she went for.
</P>
<P>
   Log entry: One of the producers asked me to buy him candy. Not
only does he take advantage of me, but also he doesn't pay me back.
What makes it worse, he always asks: ``You don't mind, do you,
honey? You know you're one of my favorite interns and I'll give you
a great recommendation when you leave.'' He also talks to me in a
condescending way, telling me to ``come here.'' Like I'm some kind
of dog.
</P>
<P>
   INTERN ASSIGNMENT: Research assistant at a weekly TV news
program.
</P>
<P>
   RUDE AWAKENING: It's who you know.
</P>
<P>
   Log entry: Favoritism plays a strong role here. Men interns who
are later hired for full-time jobs become researchers or tape
editors, while females are forced into receptionist slots. One
intern is a 17-year-old boy who is IGNORANT, LAZY and frankly
INCOMPETENT. He constantly wanders off and gives other interns
tasks he doesn't want to do, but he is the son of a friend of the
producer. It makes me SICK.
</P>
<P>
   INTERN ASSIGNMENT: Work at an upscale arts magazine in New York.
</P>
<P>
   RUDE AWAKENING: So-called creative types can be pretentious
windbags.
</P>
<P>
   Log entry: I have a problem dealing with art and artistic
people. Why do they say such things as, ``an idea expressed by this
form of multicultural contemporary art . . . is primordial in
essence''? I don't understand what the hell they are talking about.
</P>
<P>
   INTERN ASSIGNMENT: News assistant at a New York radio station.
</P>
<P>
   RUDE AWAKENING: You've got the job: Hip, hip, hooray.
</P>
<P>
   Log entry: My last day at the radio station. My boss asks me to
come into the newsroom. The next thing I know I'm being serenaded
to a chorus of ``For He's a Jolly Good Fellow.'' They swamped me
with gifts _ a hat, gingerbread cookies, Chinese food. My boss said
I was one of the top five interns of all time. Later I was informed
that I could continue on as a volunteer, but that there aren't any
paid positions available.
</P>
<P>
   INTERN ASSIGNMENT: Editorial assistant for an alternative
entertainment weekly.
</P>
<P>
   RUDE AWAKENING: The intern equivalent of learning you're not in
Kansas anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Log entry: We get freaky stuff in the mail, like the press
release from Mon Cherie's the Chamber, which is this
dance/bondage/sexual fetish club in Atlanta. It had just celebrated
its first anniversary, which was OK by me except that they felt
compelled to send us pictures of half-dressed people wearing dog
collars having chocolate sauce licked off their bodies by people in
leather. We sent them back a note saying, ``Unfortunately, we do
not have an editorial need for this type of material.''
</P>
<P>
   INTERN ASSIGNMENT: Production assistant for a local TV news
operation.
</P>
<P>
   RUDE AWAKENING: Sometimes your heroes have feet of clay.
</P>
<P>
   Log entry: The correspondent and producer were several hours
late because the correspondent hadn't finished the script. I was
stunned. At NYU, when a script is due at a certain time, it is due
then! When the correspondent finally arrived, he fixed his makeup
and complained about his red eyes. He had problems delivering his
standups and decided he would become a spoiled brat. I was in
disbelief as I watched his childlike bickering, unrealistic demands
and temper tantrums. Never had I seen someone act so
unprofessional. I then realized that this man, whom I had thought
to be one of the greatest reporters on television, was an
incompetent journalist with no talent.
</P>
<P>
   INTERN ASSIGNMENT: Reporter at the New York bureau of a major
Japanese daily.
</P>
<P>
   RUDE AWAKENING: Superiors can be imperious jerks.
</P>
<P>
   Log entry: As I have already been offered a job with a newspaper
in Tokyo after my graduation, I thought it might be wise for me to
intern at the paper's New York bureau. I telephoned the New York
bureau chief and told him of my situation. I asked if he could see
me.
</P>
<P>
   He asked, ``When?''
</P>
<P>
   I said, ``Today, tomorrow, anytime.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he gave me a scolding. ``You are being very selfish. Today?
Tomorrow. Don't you have any decency to consider our schedule?'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   I apologized most profusely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about it for a while, then call me back later,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   I thought about what to say to him, then called him back. I told
him that I was really sorry about imposing my timetable on him, but
that I would appreciate if he could decide what to do with me as
his circumstances allow.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' he said, ``are you available tomorrow?''
</P>
<P>
   INTERN ASSIGNMENT: Editorial assistant at The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   RUDE AWAKENING: The workplace can be a cold place.
</P>
<P>
   Log entry: I have just completed my first week of work at The
New York Times, the newspaper of record. . . . I enter in the
mornings without anyone saying hello and exit in the evenings
without anyone waving goodbye. At least three people in the office
pass my desk without so much as a nod or grunt in my direction. By
the way, I did mention to two others that the Times Square
neighborhood was lively. They looked at me as if I were a
two-headed dog.

By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With just a few words, the Supreme Court has made
what's been called ``the purest of all political bloodsports''
potentially bloodier. Officially, the sport is called redistricting
_ the drawing of political boundaries. But because elected
officials might lose their seats, it is known better as incumbent
protection.
</P>
<P>
   The next round of redistricting will rely on census data
gathered next year. But in a 5-4 decision in January, the court
ruled out using a method of counting called statistical sampling in
doling out the 435 House seats among the states in 2001. This kind
of sampling, which is used by pollsters and advocated by the
Clinton administration, would help account for the
disproportionately large number of blacks, Hispanics, immigrants,
poor people and city dwellers who have been overlooked by
census-takers. Instead the court said federal law requires that the
traditional method be used for distributing the House seats.
</P>
<P>
   But the court did not rule out sampling entirely. The justices
left the door open for the states to use it to apportion their own
legislatures and to draw congressional district boundaries within
each state. The Census Bureau now plans to release two sets of
numbers. The Republicans have vowed to fight the release of any
data adjusted by sampling, saying the figures can be manipulated
for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Redistricting is already the purest of all political blood
sports,'' said Tim Storey, a redistricting expert with the National
Conference of State Legislatures. ``The court's ruling just
provides another layer of uncertainty on top of all the others.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislatures or commissions that draw the district lines
within each state are already burdened by complex and sometimes
contradictory laws, court rulings and political pressures: federal
law requires that ethnic minorities' voting strength not be
diluted; incumbents expect to be protected, and neighborhoods want
to remain intact.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Clinton administration is proposing to give the states
a choice of using either the traditional count (which in addition
to the door-to-door effort includes mailed forms and other means)
or the adjusted version based on sampling. Many legislators are
saying they prefer no choice at all.
</P>
<P>
   In large states like Illinois, New York, Ohio, Texas and
California, the fighting has already begun. Democrats are pushing
to use sampling and Republicans are vowing to fight it. Losers can
be expected to take winners to court. And divided legislatures are
likely to deadlock over the issue, which would leave the map
drawing to judges. ``No matter what legislatures do, there will be
a race to the court house,'' said Storey.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 census said it missed 8.4 million people. In cities
like Chicago, Los Angeles and New York City, where the Census
Bureau determined _ using sampling _ that Hispanic and Asian groups
were undercounted in the 1990 census, sampling could be a boon to
Democrats, probably at the expense of white Republican suburbs.
Experts say that sampling in New York City could help create two
new Democratic Assembly seats and one Democratic state Senate seat.
It could also cause two marginally Republican Senate districts to
become marginally Democratic, and prevent the city's loss of a
congressional seat to the suburbs. (The state itself is projected
to lose two congressional seats in 2000.)
</P>
<P>
   In California, sampling could add one or more legislative and
congressional seats to Democratic-leaning Hispanic neighborhoods in
Los Angeles and possibly San Diego, experts said. And in states
where Republicans hold narrow majorities _ the Texas Senate and the
Houses in the Pennsylvania and Illinois Legislatures _ sampling
might even help Democrats recapture majorities. ``An adjusted
census could provide Democrats the crucial edge needed to prevail
in close contests to control several state legislative chambers,''
warned Republican National Committee chairman Jim Nicholson in a
1997 memo.
</P>
<P>
   Many political scientists and demographers discount such dire
predictions. Elections, they say, turn more on voter turnout and
other factors than redistricting. They also say creative Republican
line drawers can probably blunt the worst effects of sampling.
</P>
<P>
   Some redistricting experts say the fight over sampling could
also set off feuding among Democrats. White Democrats might oppose
using sampling data lest it would draw districts that favor
minority candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Connor, a Brooklyn Democrat who is the New York state
Senate minority leader, said that if an adjusted count had been
used for redistricting in 1991, it would have enabled the Democrats
to win control of the Senate. But it might also cause his district
to be so thoroughly redrawn he could not be re-elected, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Connor, who is white, said he wants to take his chances on
sampling in 2000. ``If I get thrown out of office, so what,'' he
said. ``The party can give me one hell of farewell dinner thanking
me for bringing them to the promised land, even if I don't make it
there myself.''

   WASHINGTON _ With just a few words, the Supreme Court has made
what's been called ``the purest of all political bloodsports''
potentially bloodier. Officially, the sport is called redistricting
_ the drawing of political boundaries. But because elected
officials might lose their seats, it is known better as incumbent
protection.
</P>
<P>
   The next round of redistricting will rely on census data
gathered next year. But in a 5-4 decision in January, the court
ruled out using a method of counting called statistical sampling in
doling out the 435 House seats among the states in 2001. This kind
of sampling, which is used by pollsters and advocated by the
Clinton administration, would help account for the
disproportionately large number of blacks, Hispanics, immigrants,
poor people and city dwellers who have been overlooked by
census-takers. Instead the court said federal law requires that the
traditional method be used for distributing the House seats.
</P>
<P>
   But the court did not rule out sampling entirely. The justices
left the door open for the states to use it to apportion their own
legislatures and to draw congressional district boundaries within
each state. The Census Bureau now plans to release two sets of
numbers. The Republicans have vowed to fight the release of any
data adjusted by sampling, saying the figures can be manipulated
for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Redistricting is already the purest of all political blood
sports,'' said Tim Storey, a redistricting expert with the National
Conference of State Legislatures. ``The court's ruling just
provides another layer of uncertainty on top of all the others.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislatures or commissions that draw the district lines
within each state are already burdened by complex and sometimes
contradictory laws, court rulings and political pressures: federal
law requires that ethnic minorities' voting strength not be
diluted; incumbents expect to be protected, and neighborhoods want
to remain intact.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Clinton administration is proposing to give the states
a choice of using either the traditional count (which in addition
to the door-to-door effort includes mailed forms and other means)
or the adjusted version based on sampling. Many legislators are
saying they prefer no choice at all.
</P>
<P>
   In large states like Illinois, New York, Ohio, Texas and
California, the fighting has already begun. Democrats are pushing
to use sampling and Republicans are vowing to fight it. Losers can
be expected to take winners to court. And divided legislatures are
likely to deadlock over the issue, which would leave the map
drawing to judges. ``No matter what legislatures do, there will be
a race to the court house,'' said Storey.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 census said it missed 8.4 million people. In cities
like Chicago, Los Angeles and New York City, where the Census
Bureau determined _ using sampling _ that Hispanic and Asian groups
were undercounted in the 1990 census, sampling could be a boon to
Democrats, probably at the expense of white Republican suburbs.
Experts say that sampling in New York City could help create two
new Democratic Assembly seats and one Democratic state Senate seat.
It could also cause two marginally Republican Senate districts to
become marginally Democratic, and prevent the city's loss of a
congressional seat to the suburbs. (The state itself is projected
to lose two congressional seats in 2000.)
</P>
<P>
   In California, sampling could add one or more legislative and
congressional seats to Democratic-leaning Hispanic neighborhoods in
Los Angeles and possibly San Diego, experts said. And in states
where Republicans hold narrow majorities _ the Texas Senate and the
Houses in the Pennsylvania and Illinois Legislatures _ sampling
might even help Democrats recapture majorities. ``An adjusted
census could provide Democrats the crucial edge needed to prevail
in close contests to control several state legislative chambers,''
warned Republican National Committee chairman Jim Nicholson in a
1997 memo.
</P>
<P>
   Many political scientists and demographers discount such dire
predictions. Elections, they say, turn more on voter turnout and
other factors than redistricting. They also say creative Republican
line drawers can probably blunt the worst effects of sampling.
</P>
<P>
   Some redistricting experts say the fight over sampling could
also set off feuding among Democrats. White Democrats might oppose
using sampling data lest it would draw districts that favor
minority candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Connor, a Brooklyn Democrat who is the New York state
Senate minority leader, said that if an adjusted count had been
used for redistricting in 1991, it would have enabled the Democrats
to win control of the Senate. But it might also cause his district
to be so thoroughly redrawn he could not be re-elected, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Connor, who is white, said he wants to take his chances on
sampling in 2000. ``If I get thrown out of office, so what,'' he
said. ``The party can give me one hell of farewell dinner thanking
me for bringing them to the promised land, even if I don't make it
there myself.''

   Here's the high-concept MOVIE PITCH: Escaped Man-Eating Tiger
Terrorizes Smalltown U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
   Drama abounds in heart-pounding tale of a suburb suddenly forced
to resolve cultural conflicts in face of primordial threat: a
marauding (actually, it was wandering, but let's invoke dramatic
license) tiger. Characters include TOM BROWN JR., wily
wilderness-skills instructor, environmental writer and backwoods
tracker, and JOAN BYRON-MARASEK, cat-lover extraordinaire known to
older locals as ``the Tiger Lady.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a true story, one that began spinning out late last month
amid the dizzying glare of the New York City media. It features
television HELICOPTERS clattering over the treetops; TERRIFIED
NEIGHBORS herding CHILDREN indoors; CLAMORING REPORTERS, COPS,
BACKWOODS SURVIVALISTS, and, naturally, LAWYERS. Not to mention the
symbolic center of the tale: BENGAL TIGER, hunted down on Jan. 27
after appearing near some new homes, shot by police as darkness
fell, limping into the woods to die.
</P>
<P>
   The SCENE: picturesque, woodsy Jackson Township, N.J., a rapidly
suburbanizing municipality 40 miles from New York in the northern
periphery of the state's vast Pine Barrens forest. The town is in
the throes of a culture clash, with new residents tucking $250,000
houses deep into the woods, imposing suburbia on crusty Pineys (as
some locals call themselves) who are struggling to maintain an
individualistic way of life that, for example, allowed MS.
BYRON-MARASEK to keep about two-dozen full-grown tigers and 40 dogs
on her 12 fenced acres without attracting a lot of commotion.
</P>
<P>
   The STORY THUS FAR: After the tiger was killed, trackers
followed the beast's path to collect prints and forensic evidence,
as Brown described it, to determine where it came from. ``The poor
thing did not act as a tiger; it acted like a lost beagle,'' said
Brown, who operates Tracker Inc., a company that conducts
wilderness and survival training courses.
</P>
<P>
   Officials believe the tiger escaped from Ms. Byron-Marasek's
place, which is registered as a charity called Tigers Only
Preservation Society. She isn't talking, but through her lawyer has
denied that the tiger was hers, casting herself as a dedicated
animal-welfare activist. Various state and federal agencies
regulate the private keeping of exotic animals like tigers and
lions, but wildlife experts say monitoring is haphazard.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the state had issued Ms. Byron-Marasek permits
to operate a haven where she cared for 23 tigers acquired from
unknown sources. Late last week, saying the site had deteriorated
significantly since it was last inspected 13 years ago, the state
ordered her to make immediate improvements in safety fencing and
other conditions or lose her tiger permits.
</P>
<P>
   (In a SUBPLOT, astonished Jackson Township residents learned
after the shooting that their 100-square-mile municipality was
actually home to as many as 30 tigers, giving it the distinction of
having one of the greatest concentrations of tigers on Earth _
higher even than the most dense tiger populations in their natural
habitats in Asia. For besides the 23 registered to Ms.
Byron-Marasek, another 9 tigers reside at the nearby Six Flags
Great Adventure amusement park, which insists that all of its
tigers are accounted for.)
</P>
<P>
   The town is torn. A roadside memorial to the slain tiger has
been erected. Yellow ribbons flutter from pine trees. Animal rights
activists have set up a defense fund for Ms. Byron-Marasek.
</P>
<P>
   THE MORAL: ``Basically, tigers are huge predators,'' said David
Phemister, the conservation programs coordinator for the National
Fish and Wildlife Foundation, which manages the international Save
the Tiger Fund. ``Keeping them as pets, even in a situation where
you're performing an animal welfare or rescue operation, is
something that almost inevitably doesn't work out. And it seems to
me personally that an escaped tiger roaming through suburban New
Jersey is the epitome of things not working out.''
</P>
<P>
   About 8,000 tigers now live in the wild, down from over 100,000
at the start of this century, according to Save the Tiger Fund.
Another 1,000 tigers are held worldwide in zoos, conservation
parks, circuses and the like, according to the American Zoo and
Aquarium Association.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Jackson Township tiger hunt showed, no one really can
say how many tigers are living where you'd least expect to find
them. A 1997 National Geographic article pictured an Arkansas woman
who keeps 52 of the big cats at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be more tigers in private hands in the United
States than there are wild tigers in India,'' said Phemister.
``How's that for a depressing thought?''
</P>
<P>
   FADE OUT.

DELAYED IN SERBIA, REBELS' DELEGATES LEAVE FOR TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMBOUILLET, France _ The Kosovo peace conference, initially
designed as an elaborate set piece of diplomacy, stumbled toward a
chaotic opening on Saturday. Ethnic Albanian delegates were finally
allowed to fly out of Serbia and join foreign ministers who had
been left cooling their heels in the gardens of the chateau where
the negotiations will take place.
</P>
<P>
   The three delegates, guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army,
were refused travel documents by the Serbian authorities whom they
are fighting. But after intense Western pressure _ and after having
made the point that they could cause a ruckus at this conference
any time they wanted _ the Serbs relented early Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The three men, Jakup Krasniqi, Ram Buja and Zem Syla, who
changed their mud-caked boots and crumpled camouflage uniforms of
the Kosovo Liberation Army for suits, ties and topcoats, were
picked up at their rural headquarters and driven to the airport in
Pristina, Kosovo's capital, by Western diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   The full 16-member ethnic Albanian delegation, which includes
the Albanians' political leader Ibrahim Rugova, was expected to
join the 13-member Serbian delegation at the chateau, where
President Jacques Chirac of France, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook of
Britain and Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine of France were waiting
to open the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The bumpy start to the conference was a fitting prelude to what
could be a two-week standoff between the two sides, who seek widely
differing solutions to the crisis in Kosovo, a province of southern
Serbia that was stripped of its autonomy in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Serbian delegation, Deputy Prime Minister
Ratko Markovic, set the tone for his side on the eve of the
conference, saying he would not speak _ even through intermediaries
_ to the Albanian ``terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs insist that Kosovo, the heart of Serbia's medieval
empire, must remain a part of Serbia, while the ethnic Albanians _
who make up 90 percent of the 2 million people estimated to live in
Kosovo _ want independence.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats from the United States, the European Union and Russia
who will run the day-to-day negotiations here are seeking an
in-between autonomous status.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration pushed hard the week before last to
persuade NATO to agree to air strikes against Serbia if President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia refuses to agree to a political
settlement at the end of two weeks of talks here.
</P>
<P>
   But it still seemed unclear whether NATO would actually go ahead
with air strikes or try to find a face-saving way out.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said on Thursday that he was ``seriously
considering'' sending U.S. ground troops to Kosovo as part of a
NATO-led force. He emphasized that he would do so only if a
political settlement was reached _ and Clinton said that was a
``big `if.'''
</P>
<P>
   A fairly big stumbling block to productive talks here appeared
obvious from the outset. The Serbian delegation includes Nikola
Sainovic and Vladen Kutlesic, both Yugoslav deputy prime ministers.
But like Markovic, they have little power. They are essentially
factotums of Milosevic, who according to Western diplomats will
have to be consulted by his three men at every step of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the talks were to start, NATO's European commander,
Gen. Wesley Clark, sounded a note of caution, suggesting that
neither the Serbs nor the Albanians _ whose delegation represents
the very disparate views of Kosovo's majority population _ really
have their minds fixed on success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned that the conflict parties are prepared
for a failure of the peace talks,'' he told Deutschland Radio
Berlin in Germany. ``With every battle the conflict becomes more
and more difficult to handle. Therefore we hope and will do all we
can to ensure the conflict parties reach a successful agreement,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore the gravity and ferocity of the Kosovo conflict,
Human Rights Watch, a New York-based group, released a report here
Saturday, detailing some of the main atrocities in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The report, based heavily on witness accounts, focuses on a
massacre in Obrinje on Sept. 26, when 21 members of the Delijaj
family were killed by Serb forces. It also gives details of a
summary execution on the same day of 13 ethnic Albanian men and of
a massacre last month of 45 civilians in the village of Racak.
</P>
<P>
   The conference comes almost a year since the outbreak of
fighting between the Kosovo Liberation Army and the much stronger
forces of the Serbian police and the Yugoslav army.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting has been marked by guerrilla tactics of ambush by
the ethnic Albanians and by tank and artillery attacks by the Serbs
against village farmers, whose compounds the Serbs see as potential
guerrilla bases.
</P>
<P>
   The massacre in Racak last month convinced the Clinton
administration that the Kosovo conflict was not likely to go away
and had the potential of marring the 50th anniversary celebration
of NATO in Washington in April.
</P>
<P>
   The cease-fire arranged last October by the U.S. envoy, Richard
Holbrooke, evaporated last month as more Serbian troops returned to
Kosovo to confront resolute, better-armed guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 unarmed international monitors, working under
the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, were unable to stop the fighting, and in the case of the
Racak massacre were prevented from entering the village when the
killings were under way.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that NATO's credibility was on the line, the Clinton
administration decided to push for a negotiated settlement that
would have as its basis the same sort of autonomy that Milosevic
stripped from Kosovo 10 years ago. He has ruled the region with
heavy police repression ever since.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The plan under discussion at Rambouillet has been drafted in the
last three months in separate, and largely fruitless, talks with
the Serbs and the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Hill, the main U.S. envoy to the talks, told
reporters on Friday that neither side likes the plan. It denies the
Albanians the independence they crave, while for the Serbs it gives
away too much _ in particular by requiring them to withdraw almost
all security forces.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States, the four European countries and Russia _
which make up the so-called Contact Group formed to solve the
problems arising from the breakup of former Yugoslavia _ have made
clear that this is largely a non-negotiable plan.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials openly talk of imposing a settlement
on the two sides, an unusual negotiating tactic in the world of
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sign on the dotted line'' is the message, a U.S. official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially the plan makes Kosovo, a pocket of European
countryside about the size of Connecticut with steep mountains and
fertile land, an international protectorate for three years. During
that time, elections and the makings of self-government are
envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Kosovo would be called on to form their own
police, courts and other institutions so that the ethnic Albanians
can take control of those spheres. Serbian authorities would retain
the power to make foreign, economic and defense policies.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign negotiators are likely to oppose an Albanian desire
to hold a referendum on independence at the end of those three
years. An independent Kosovo would challenge the sanctity of
borders in the Balkans _ in particular complicating the situation
in Bosnia, whose Serbs control almost half the country and still
seek union with neighboring Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators' plan implies that the Serbs would use the
three-year interim period to show that political and economic
reform in Serbia, one of two remaining republics in Yugoslavia
along with Montenegro, was sufficiently advanced to make it
feasible for Kosovo to remain within Yugoslavia. This proposition,
Western diplomats acknowledge, is difficult to imagine if Milosevic
remains in power.

   IMPEACH-TRIAL (Washington) _ With the end of President Clinton's
impeachment trial in sight, House prosecutors on Saturday showed
the Senate videotaped excerpts from the sworn depositions of Monica
Lewinsky _ the first time the public had a chance to see her speak
since her affair with the president became known a year ago.
Prosecutors clearly hoped that the senators and the public would be
struck by Ms. Lewinsky's youth and vulnerability and that this
impression would work to Clinton's disadvantage. By David E.

   IMPEACH-LEADERS (Washington) _ Amid the partisan fires of the
impeachment and trial of President Clinton, Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott of Mississippi and Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South

collapsed and votes split along strictly partisan lines, senators

reason the trial could end within the next week. By Frank Bruni.

   JORDAN-HUSSEIN (Amman, Jordan) _ With King Hussein unconscious
and near death, Jordan's government transferred full powers today
to Crown Prince Abdullah, making the 37-year-old heir to the throne
king in all but name. The decision effectively ended the
47-year-rule of King Hussein, who was deemed no longer capable of
carrying out his duties. The king's lungs, liver and kidneys have
failed, his doctors said Saturday, and he is being kept alive with
a respirator. By Douglas Jehl.

these assignments, teachers, school administrators and

Juan Antonio Samaranch remains a servant of sport who transformed

   IMPEACH-TRIAL (Washington) _ Senators on Saturday watched
excerpts from the videotaped depositions of Monica Lewinsky, Vernon

   IMPEACH-LEADERS (Washington) _ Amid the partisan fires of the
impeachment and trial of President Clinton, the Senate majority

   NIGERIA-ELECTIONS (Kano, Nigeria) _ As Nigeria prepares to hold
presidential elections on Feb. 27 and usher in a civilian
government in May, no single leader seems capable of healing the
gash on the nation's political soul that was inflicted on June 12,
1993. On that date, Moshood K.O. Abiola, a billionaire businessman,

   PRESERVING-DOCUMENTS (Washington) _ This week, the National
Archives and Records Administration is expected to unveil the
design of the new enclosures for the Declaration of Independence,
Constitution and Bill of Rights. The enclosures are airtight cells
of titanium and aluminum that will hold the documents behind
tempered glass in an atmosphere of inert argon gas. The
encasements, resembling large, deep picture frames, will replace
similar enclosures that were made almost 50 years ago and appear to
be prematurely deteriorating. By Warren E. Leary. With graphic.

   SOCSEC-DEBATE (Atlanta) _ For their parents, who watched stocks
crash and banks fail, the government was considered the salvation
of a generation that had been betrayed by the financial markets.
But for today's aging baby boomers, who face increasing concerns
about the solvency of Social Security and other federal retirement
programs, it is now the government that cannot be trusted and a
bullish Wall Street that provides some hope. That dynamic, detected
in public opinion polls and a score of recent interviews with baby

   GUNS-CHECKS (Washington) _ President Clinton said Saturday that
he would ask Congress to require background checks on all people
who bought firearms at gun shows and flea markets, regardless of
whether the sellers were commercial gun dealers. Clinton summarized
his proposal this way: ``No background check, no gun, no
exceptions.'' By Robert Pear.

<P>
   SNOWMOBILE-BAN (Grand Lake, Colo.) _ An arctic gale was blowing
in Squeak Creek as Ken Todd roared down from the Continental
Divide, bucking his powerful snowmobile through drifts on a road in
Rocky Mountain National Park. It was a motorized tableau that a
coalition of environmental groups would like to erase from the
National Park System. In a midwinter attack, the coalition, called
the Bluewater Network, has petitioned Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt to ban snowmobiles from the 28 places among the National
Park System's 378 that allow them. By James Brooke. With photo.

<P>
   SOFTWARE-LAWYER (Houston) _ It may look like a computer disk,
but in the eyes of a federal judge in Texas it behaves too much
like a lawyer. In a ruling last month thought to be the first of
its type in the country, Judge Barefoot Sanders of Federal District
Court in Dallas found that Parsons Technology Inc., which publishes
Quicken Family Lawyer and Quicken Family Lawyer '99, goes too far
in the assistance it provides consumers, resulting in an
unauthorized practice of law in the state. By Barbara Whitaker.

   The Budget Fight Opens in Washington
</P>
<P>
   The scramble has begun for trillions of dollars in surplus
federal revenues. President Clinton proposed a $1.77 trillion
budget for the year 2000 jammed full of tax breaks and new spending
_ for families with children and for schools, the elderly and
disabled, the environment and scientific research.
</P>
<P>
   But he warned Congress again not to lay a finger on the $117
billion budget surplus for that year and the more than $2.4
trillion in surpluses he projects for the next 10 years. Clinton
insists the money should be held in reserve until a plan is
completed to insure the long-term solvency of Social Security and
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress have other plans _ a big
across-the-board tax cut. But they can't agree on the structure and
size of the cut.

   Most of the land is in the Lewis and Clark National Forest, near
Glacier National Park and the Bob Marshall Wilderness. It is the
only place where grizzly bears frequently roam down from the

   The District of Columbia's latest incident of racial tension

to return to his job.
</P>
<P>
   The aide, David Howard, resigned after reports that the
co-worker thought he had used a racial epithet, rather than a word
that is a synonym for miserly and does not derive from the slur.
After investigating, Williams found that Howard did not utter the
slur that the co-worker thought he heard. The mayor also told
Howard he had acted ``too hastily'' in accepting his resignation.

Missouri Democrat realized he had a better chance of becoming
speaker of the House than of becoming president, what with Vice
President Al Gore's grip on much of the party apparatus.

the plight of Kevin Knussman, a Maryland state trooper who, because
he was a male, was denied paternity leave to care for his newborn
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes, what it takes is a lawsuit: On Tuesday, in the
first sex-discrimination case under the federal Family and Medical
Leave Act, a federal jury in Baltimore awarded Knussman $375,000 in
emotional damages. The American Civil Liberties Union, which
represented the trooper Knussman, said the case established that
fathers have the same right to care for babies as mothers.

   Walter Payton played 13 years for the Chicago Bears, leading

record for rushing yardage; his career mark of 16,726 yards gained
still stands.
</P>
<P>
   That was then. Now, at 44, Payton finds himself struck by a rare
liver disease that requires a transplant within two years. Payton,
thin and appearing tired, made his condition known at an emotional
news conference at which he asked friends and fans to pray for him.

   AIDS Virus Traced to Chimps
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the AIDS epidemic was discovered in 1981, many have
wondered: Where did the AIDS virus come from? Virus detectives say
they have an answer: an endangered subspecies of chimpanzees. Using
genetic and molecular tests, an international team of scientists
said they had traced the origin of HIV-1, the virus that has caused
most of the 30 million AIDS infections in the world, to Pan
troglodytes troglodytes, chimpanzees that live in west and central
Africa. Because these chimpanzees apparently can live with the
virus without falling ill, a hope is to use the discovery to
eventually improve therapies and develop an effective vaccine.

   Money or Power Required. Skis Welcome Too.

   The hotel rooms veer from spartan to luxurious, and suites are
said to be in short supply. The rattling railway through the Alps
takes hours to get there. A snowstorm grounded the helicopters of
the wealthy and turned the road snaking up from the valley into a
white-out.
</P>
<P>
   Yet billionaires and presidents attending the privately funded
World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos proved once
again that the gathering, which has no official status, seems
irresistible to the world's elite.
</P>
<P>
   For six days, the big stars of policy, high finance and high
visibility _ from Nelson Mandela to George Soros and Yasser Arafat,
from Al Gore to Kofi Annan and Jane Fonda _ clustered in a concrete
conference center that someone nicknamed ``the bunker'' to debate
topics ranging from executive health to the maladies of the global
economy (the dominant theme).
</P>
<P>
   The forum reaches no binding decisions. But, for participants,
it is supposed to nurture networking and brainstorming among
government leaders and corporate barons, even as it provides a
platform for sonorous pronouncements and encourages debate on
weighty issues. And, of course, for those with energy left over,
Davos is ringed by crystalline ski-slopes that, last week, were in
perfect condition.

   Ever since the AIDS epidemic was discovered in 1981, many have
wondered: Where did the AIDS virus come from? Virus detectives say
they have an answer: an endangered subspecies of chimpanzees. Using
genetic and molecular tests, an international team of scientists
said they had traced the origin of HIV-1, the virus that has caused
most of the 30 million AIDS infections in the world, to Pan
troglodytes troglodytes, chimpanzees that live in west and central
Africa. Because these chimpanzees apparently can live with the
virus without falling ill, a hope is to use the discovery to
eventually improve therapies and develop an effective vaccine.

   Money or Power Required. Skis Welcome Too.

   The hotel rooms veer from spartan to luxurious, and suites are
said to be in short supply. The rattling railway through the Alps
takes hours to get there. A snowstorm grounded the helicopters of
the wealthy and turned the road snaking up from the valley into a
white-out.
</P>
<P>
   Yet billionaires and presidents attending the privately funded
World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos proved once
again that the gathering, which has no official status, seems
irresistible to the world's elite.
</P>
<P>
   For six days, the big stars of policy, high finance and high
visibility _ from Nelson Mandela to George Soros and Yasser Arafat,
from Al Gore to Kofi Annan and Jane Fonda _ clustered in a concrete
conference center that someone nicknamed ``the bunker'' to debate
topics ranging from executive health to the maladies of the global
economy (the dominant theme).
</P>
<P>
   The forum reaches no binding decisions. But, for participants,
it is supposed to nurture networking and brainstorming among
government leaders and corporate barons, even as it provides a
platform for sonorous pronouncements and encourages debate on
weighty issues. And, of course, for those with energy left over,
Davos is ringed by crystalline ski-slopes that, last week, were in
perfect condition.

   A Deal for Holbrooke?
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke has agreed to settle an ethics charge that has
stood in the way of his becoming the United States' top delegate to
the United Nations, people close to the case said.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who won wide respect in 1995 for leading the talks
that ended the war in Bosnia, quit the State Department in 1996. He
then violated regulations barring contacts with his former
government colleagues by contacting the U.S. Embassy in South Korea
in his new job with an investment-banking firm, the Justice
Department maintained. Holbrooke will reportedly pay $5,000 to put
the affair behind him, while admitting no wrongdoing.

   The routines of wintertime went on in Karaganda, Kazakhstan, as
a bold Russian plan to illuminate the remote Kazakh city at night
with beams of light from outer space turned into a disappointing
fizzle.
</P>
<P>
   Astronauts on the Russian space station Mir were to have bounced
sunlight off an 82-foot mirror in orbit and then directed the rays
toward the ground, lighting up nine cities around the globe with
beams of light a few miles wide and up to ten times brighter than
the full moon.
</P>
<P>
   But the mirror, like a balky umbrella, failed to unfurl
Thursday. On Friday, the astronauts tried again. But the mirror,
made of thin plastic with a metallic surface, once more balked and
was discarded.
</P>
<P>
   The setback can do no good for Russia's ailing space program,
which is trying to steady itself with commercial ties and grandiose
dreams. But it delighted astronomers, who say light pollution from
such mirrors could blind telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   The project's architects, the Space Regatta Consortium, said in
an open letter to astronomers that their goal was to pave the way
for space adventure as well as to serve people on Earth ``through
the hard times.'' _ WILLIAM J. BROAD

<P>
   With impeachment dominating the news, it's not easy for Congress
to advance the premise that the rest of government is still
functioning. Which may explain why a 6-year-old was testifying
before a House subcommittee on Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Anderson Jr. of Brooklyn won't turn 65 until 2057, but
his appearance was intended to dramatize the debate over how best
to shore up Social Security to meet the demands of retiring baby
boomers and future generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to retire, you must save and invest,'' Richard
advised. ``If you don't you might have to work all your life. No
one wants to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Clay Shaw, R-Fla, chairman of the subcommittee, said
Richard was the youngest person to testify before Congress. Last
year, he was described as the youngest to ring the opening bell at
the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Richard, who lives with his mother in the Crown Heights section,
said he learned about finance the hard way: As a punishment for bad
behavior, his father, a financial planner, would make him watch
CNBC, the all-news cable channel.

for Sunday, Feb. 7, moved Saturday.

   Scheduled for the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   JORDAN-HISTORY-REVIEW (Undated) _ The ruling dynasty of the
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan stretches back through the mists of
time to ... May 25, 1946. Of all the artificial Middle Eastern
countries arbitrarily created by the Western powers after World War
I, none was more artificial than the tiny, poor, lawless leftover
patch of desert that would become Jordan. By John Kifner. (`i'
category). WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   DRAFT-REVIVAL-REVIEW (Washington) _ A quarter century after the
last conscripts mustered at boot camp, the idea of reviving the
draft has gained new currency among a small lot of academics,
lawmakers and, even, military commanders. They argue that a
restoration of the draft _ perhaps as part of some compulsory
national service _ would not only answer the personnel crises
facing today's volunteer forces but also provide a much-needed
curative to the military's growing detachment from society. By
Steven Lee Myers. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Inside the section, moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   EX-SPIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Hundreds of former CIA and KGB
agents are working together as business partners to provide
sensitive information to American corporations. These out-of-work
spies from the U.S. and Russia are joining hands in the pursuit of
capitalism, providing protection, intelligence and political risk
assessments to U.S. companies extending their reach to emerging
markets and other global hot spots. By Leslie Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   GLOBAL-LENDING-REVIEW (Undated) _ Ever since the global
financial crisis began in East Asia 19 months ago, the public
debate has focused on how to keep poor countries from borrowing too
much money. Now, though, economists and policy-makers have been
struck by a new insight: whenever somebody is borrowing too much,
somebody else is lending too much. So begins a new debate about how
best to restrain the lenders who got the countries into trouble in
the first place. By Louis Uchitelle.
</P>
<P>
   _ Inside the section, moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   INTERNS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Monica Lewinsky is not the first
bright-eyed intern dealt a rude awakening by the realities of
office sex, intrigue, power politics or just plain bad workplace
behavior. A look at the experiences of journalism students sent as
interns into the world of newspapers, TV and radio.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-ENGLAND-REVIEW (London) _ In 1386, Michael de la Pole,
Earl of Suffolk, became the first person in history to be
impeached. His case also marked the first appearance of the phrase
`high crimes and misdemeanors.' And there began a long and tangled
process of legal challenge to executive authority by a legislative
body that, somewhat circuitously, brought Bill Clinton to trial in
the U.S. Senate. By Alan Cowell.
</P>
<P>
   HOMELESS-DEPRESSION-REVIEW (New York) _ Depression and
manic-depression, with its wild mood swings, are becoming
recognized as a significant cause of homelessness. Shelters have
long been filled with schizophrenics, people whose hallucinations
and delusions force them out of jobs, homes and relationships. But
the link between depression and homelessness is only now becoming
clear. By Lynette Holloway.
</P>
<P>
   SOCSEC-STOCKS-REVIEW (Washington) _ What would happen if the
government were investing hundreds of billions of dollars of Social
Security reserves in the stock market, and congressional
anti-abortion forces decided that none of this money should be put
into companies that make or import abortion pills? That is the kind
of nightmare foreseen by economists and politicians who oppose
President Clinton's plan to beef up Social Security reserves by
investing some of the money in stocks. Political tampering, Alan
Greenspan said, could endanger `the efficiency of our capital
markets and thus our economy.' By David E. Rosenbaum. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   CENSUS-REDISTRICT-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at the political
implications of dueling census methods. The Supreme Court ruled out
using a method of counting called statistical sampling in doling
out the 435 House seats among the states in 2001. This kind of
sampling, which is used by pollsters and advocated by the Clinton
administration, would help account for the disproportionately large
number of blacks, Hispanics, immigrants, poor people and city
dwellers who have been overlooked by census-takers. By James Dao.
</P>
<P>
   TIGER-TROUBLE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Here's the high-concept movie
pitch: Escaped Man-Eating Tiger Terrorizes Smalltown U.S.A. Drama
abounds in heart-pounding tale of a suburb suddenly forced to
resolve cultural conflicts in face of primordial threat: a
marauding (actually, it was wandering, but let's invoke dramatic
license) tiger. It's a true story, one that began spinning out late
last month amid the dizzying glare of the New York media. By Joe
Sharkey.

(JT) 
 By ROGER COHEN with JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BARCELONA, Spain _ The man who steered the Olympic Games from
financial ruin to huge prosperity over the past 18 years is a
mild-mannered Spaniard whose unchanging attire _ blue suit, blue
shirt, blue tie _ amounts to the uniform of somebody who prefers to
pass unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   But here in his hometown, Juan Antonio Samaranch keeps a
basement office that tells of a man welcomed with deferential
tribute. The octagonal room has the untouched air of a mausoleum
filled with offerings: a silver cup with chrysanthemum crest
presented by the emperor of Japan, an oil painting of Samaranch
from Russia, and, in the entrance, a woven tapestry-portrait
presented by a Kuwaiti sheik.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch earns no salary in his job as president of the
International Olympic Committee, but travels the world like a head
of state. All of his expenses outside Spain _ a modest suite at the
Palace hotel in Lausanne, Switzerland; food, first-class air travel
and so on _ are paid by the Olympic movement or countries hoping to
become host to the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept suites,'' he said of the lavish accommodations
offered by Olympic hopefuls. ``I need a living room.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how much his life style costs the IOC annually, Samaranch
said in an interview: ``I don't know. Hundreds of thousands of
dollars, maybe, millions no. I fly first-class. It's normal. I am
78 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past two months, with the Olympic movement battered by
allegations of corruption at Salt Lake City and elsewhere,
Samaranch has sought to bridge the gap between his retiring
personality and insistent images of uncontrolled indulgence. For
his supporters, he remains a servant of sport who transformed the
Olympics from financial ruin to unimagined prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   But an examination of Samaranch's life, based on interviews in
Europe, Asia and North America, suggests that at the least he had
no enthusiasm for uncovering wrongdoing in the Olympic movement and
may have encouraged it through his own example as he pursued his
consuming goal of broadening and enriching the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that Samaranch ever sought personal
enrichment from this booming Olympics-related business. But more
money slowly brought demands _ for controls and transparency _ that
were unfamiliar to him. IOC members appear to have felt little or
no pressure from their president to resist seductive blandishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mistakes? I don't know about mistakes,'' Samaranch said. ``We
explained clearly what the rules were, we heard some rumors, we
tried to reduce the number of people in the selection process for
Olympic cities, but we could not. Naturally members are attached to
their privileges.''
</P>
<P>
   He has his defenders. Marc Hodler, the veteran Swiss IOC member
and lawyer whose public comments on corruption helped ignite the
current scandal, called Samaranch a ``great president'' who
``achieved unique things by understanding the commercial potential
of the Games.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe so much to him,'' said Anita DeFrantz, the American
vice president of the IOC. ``Women are now members of the IOC. More
women compete in the Olympics. He should be allowed to complete his
job by cleaning things up.''
</P>
<P>
   Of middling build and modest manner, courteous, attentive to
detail, fanatical about physical fitness, Samaranch quietly builds
bridges and loyalty, edging toward well-defined ambitions with a
mixture of tact and tenacity.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Samaranch has achieved what he sets out to do. Jose
Maria Sumpsi, a longtime friend of the IOC president, showed a
design conceived by Samaranch in the 1960s that featured the shield
of the provincial government of Barcelona above the five-ringed
Olympic symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was done years before Samaranch was president of either
body,'' Sumpsi said, ``but he already knew clearly what he wanted;
then he went for it. In 1973, he became the president of the
Barcelona provincial government. Seven years later, he was
president of the IOC. The vision on this design came true.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for nothing, it seems. Consider Samaranch on the subject of
diplomacy, an art he formally practiced for just three years, as
Spain's ambassador to Moscow between 1977 and 1980:
</P>
<P>
   Know how to listen. Never speak in a language not your own (an

been a consistent feature of Samaranch's life.

<P>
   The son of a self-made Barcelona textile baron and a one-time
sportswriter who used the pen name Stick, Samaranch was born to
considerable wealth in 1920. He emerged in the late 1940s as a
passionate sportsman with a particular interest in roller-hockey (a
sort of poor man's ice hockey), and an eye for political
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Dapper, gallant, he earned a reputation as a lady's man of
unfailing solicitude (birthdays duly noted, bouquets always on
time). His wealth was cemented and standing enhanced with his
marriage in 1955 to a Barcelona society beauty, Maria Teresa
Salisachs, whose family money was older than his own.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time he rose steadily in the ranks of Gen. Franco's
Fascist administration, becoming the rough equivalent of a junior
under-secretary of sport and gaining the prestige that allowed him
to join the IOC in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not ashamed of what I did in Spain,'' Samaranch said.
``Franco did good things for my country. He kept us out of World
War II. He created a middle class. He chose a good successor, the
king.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch smoothly navigated Spain's transition from autocratic
to democratic rule after Franco's death in 1975. ``He adapts to
everything,'' said Ernest Lluch, a former Spanish health minister
who knows Samaranch. ``In fact, he is one of the great
chameleons.''
</P>
<P>
   Just two years after Franco's death, Samaranch was named Spain's
first ambassador to Moscow. Already a vice president of the IOC,
Samaranch had a clear aim in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years after joining the IOC in 1966, I had started
thinking about being president,'' he recalled. ``Moscow was
preparing the Olympics of 1980, and I knew that going there would
be a good move for my ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   As it was. When Lord Killanin of Ireland stepped down in 1980,
Samaranch was elected with an absolute majority of 47 votes in the
first round. Hispanic and Soviet-bloc votes helped do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Many, however, saw the presidency as a poisoned chalice.
``Everybody was writing the Olympic obituary,'' said Michael Payne,
a British IOC member who oversees marketing. ``We were politically
and financially bankrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   After the African boycott of the 1976 Summer Games in Montreal,
60 Western nations, led by the United States, boycotted the 1980
Moscow Games over the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Sport seemed
a Cold War victim. The IOC had less than $500,000 in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch responded with an extraordinary energy, apparently
driven by his abhorrence of conflict, his Spanish experience of
political reconciliation and his vision of an all-embracing
Olympics. Wherever he could, and by whatever means, he reached out
to extend the Olympic family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has always known how to soften people and he impregnated
the Olympics with this art,'' said Jaume Boix Angelats, the author
of a critical biography of Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   Where Samaranch appears to have failed is in not perceiving that
making the Olympics bigger _ his unswerving goal _ required
balancing with tighter controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cost-effectiveness and Internet-style openness are concepts
foreign to him,'' said Alberto Montagut, an editor of the Catalan
edition of the newspaper El Mundo. ``Resignation does not exist in
his culture, because it is the act of an accountable type of
management.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, management was not much of an issue for the Olympic
movement: there was almost no money to manage.
</P>
<P>
   When Hodler, the Swiss IOC member, joined in the early 1960s, he
recalled that the only revenue was the 40 Swiss francs ($29) paid
each year by members _ providing overall annual revenue of about
$300.
</P>
<P>
   Under Samaranch, however, the quaint poverty of aristocrats and
gentlemen gave way to the rigorously commercialized wealth of
managers of the lucrative five-ringed Olympic brand.
</P>
<P>
   After Peter Ueberroth demonstrated at Los Angeles in 1984 that
clever marketing could make the Olympics profitable, IOC income
from sales of television rights, exclusive corporate sponsorships,
licensing agreements and tickets soared. Worldwide television and
sponsorship rights are now worth $3.5 billion for the 1997-2000
period alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We changed the Olympic movement,'' Samaranch said. ``We made
it universal. We gave it the means to help people. We held one
Olympics after another that was a triumph.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch has now become a vociferous advocate of reform. At the
president's insistence, the Olympics acted quickly to sanction
members accused at Salt Lake City, and is pushing for a radical
change in its own structures.
</P>
<P>
   But the IOC president's most cherished project _ the Olympic
museum in Lausanne _ captures the contradictions that may make such
reform difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the museum, which is approached through a faux Greek
colonnade, a flame burns with the inscription ``The Olympic flame
brightens the world.'' Beside it is a sign pointing to the museum's
nearby ``SWATCH'' store. Even here, idealism and commercialism
nestle side by side.

 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the end of President Clinton's impeachment
trial in sight, House prosecutors Saturday showed the Senate
videotaped excerpts from the sworn depositions of Monica Lewinsky
and two other witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time the public had a chance to see Ms.
Lewinsky, 25, speak since her affair with Clinton became known a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Because the transcripts of the depositions had already been
published, no new evidence was presented Saturday. But the
prosecutors clearly hoped that the senators and the public would be
struck by Ms. Lewinsky's youth and vulnerability and that this
impression would work to Clinton's disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   In that vein, Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., the lead-off
prosecutor, said the videotapes showed ``the image of a young
woman, very much like a family member we might know.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogan maintained, ``If her testimony is truthful, then the
president committed the offenses alleged in the articles of
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, in a dark dress with a string of pearls, came
across as a practiced witness, composed with a strong voice. She
often brushed a strand of hair away from her left eye.
</P>
<P>
   Her testimony was familiar. She never varied from her statements
to the federal grand jury about her intimate relationship with
Clinton. And she testified that the president's secretary, Betty
Currie, had approached her to retrieve gifts from the president.
</P>
<P>
   This is a point in dispute that bears on the charge that the
president tried to obstruct justice by hiding the gifts. Mrs.
Currie told the grand jury that Ms. Lewinsky had initiated the
discussions about the presents.
</P>
<P>
   The House prosecutors decided not to call Mrs. Currie to
testify, in part because the Senate limited the prosecutors to
three witnesses and in part because they thought Mrs. Currie's
testimony would not help their case against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan insisted that the prosecutors were not interested in the
president's sexual indiscretion. He declared: ``Throughout all of
this, throughout this presentation, it is important to keep in mind
that we seek no congressional punishment for a man who chose to
cheat on his wife. However, we have a legal obligation to expect
constitutional accountability for a president who chooses to cheat
the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Ms. Lewinsky, excerpts were shown from depositions of
Vernon Jordan, the president's confidant, and Sidney Blumenthal, a
White House assistant.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors mixed and matched excerpts from the three
witnesses to provide a narrative for the case they were building
against Clinton. Rogan called it ``a web of perjury and obstruction
of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan spoke about his efforts to obtain a job for Ms. Lewinsky,
and Blumenthal told of how the president had described Ms. Lewinsky
as a stalker whose sexual advances he had rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said that there was no question in his mind but that he
was acting on behalf of the president when he tried to find a job
for Ms. Lewinsky and that Clinton showed considerable interest in
the matter. But Jordan stressed that he had not been told that Ms.
Lewinsky had been called as a witness in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment suit against the president.
</P>
<P>
   In his grand jury testimony in August, Clinton said he had only
a minimal role in soliciting Jordan's job-search efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors argued that these were elements of Clinton's
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's session, ending the fifth week of the trial, was the
last in the evidentiary stage. Next week, the Senate will hear
closing arguments by the House prosecutors and the president's
lawyers and will then begin deliberating on the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Separate votes on each of the two articles of impeachment _ on
perjury and obstruction of justice _ are expected by the end of the
week. It would require a two-thirds majority to convict the
president and remove him from office. Senators from both parties
agree that acquittal is a foregone conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Senate rules, which were written for the impeachment
trial of President Andrew Johnson in 1868, the deliberations on the
verdict must be in closed session, with no senator permitted to
speak for more than 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan movement is under way to have the debate next week
in public and on television, but it was unclear Saturday whether
the two-thirds majority needed to change the rules could be
mustered. Some senators who want an open debate said they might
reduce the time limit for senators' speeches.
</P>
<P>
   The deposition of Ms. Lewinsky was taken on Monday in the
presidential suite of the Mayflower Hotel here. Jordan and
Blumenthal were questioned on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively,
in a soundproof hearing room on the fourth floor of the Capitol.
Transcripts of the depositions were published on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The use of videotaped excerpts Saturday was the result of a
compromise.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The House prosecutors, who initially hoped to call more
witnesses, wanted to interrogate Ms. Lewinsky, Jordan and
Blumenthal in person in the well of the Senate. Many Republican
senators supported them.
</P>
<P>
   Most Democrats did not want the witnesses' testimony to be
presented at all. If videotapes were shown, the Democrats argued,
they should be shown in full.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Senate voted, 70-30, not to have witnesses
testify in person. Then, the Senate voted, 62-38, to permit parts
of the depositions to be presented on videotape. Before the
impeachment trial, videotapes had never been shown on the floor of
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes Saturday, senators continued to discuss
whether and how to censure Clinton for his misconduct. Many
Democrats, though certainly not all of them, favor a formal
condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   This would be a way for them to show their constituents that
while they did not believe that Clinton's actions warranted his
removal from office, they deplored his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are divided. While some favor censure, many others
see such a move as a way to let Democrats off the political hook.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans abandoned an earlier plan to condemn Clinton
with a ``findings of fact'' resolution within the impeachment
process. Almost all Democrats objected to this procedure, and
without Democratic support, Republicans decided not to push the
matter.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>
   At the outset of Saturday's session, the Senate chaplain, Lloyd
Ogilvie, offered a prayer for Scott Bates, the Senate's legislative
clerk, who was killed Friday night when he was struck by a car
while he was crossing a highway in Arlington, Va. Sen. Trent Lott
of Mississippi, the Republican leader, and Sen. Tom Daschle of
South Dakota, the Democratic leader, gave brief tributes.
</P>
<P>
   In his job, Bates sat beneath the presiding officer in the
Senate chamber and often read documents aloud and called the roll
of senators during votes.

OLY-SAMARANCH-SHORT-VERSION) 
(JT) 
 By ROGER COHEN with JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BARCELONA, Spain _ The man who steered the Olympic Games from
financial ruin to huge prosperity over the past 18 years is a
mild-mannered Spaniard whose unchanging attire _ blue suit, blue
shirt, blue tie _ amounts to the uniform of somebody who prefers to
pass unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   But here in his hometown, Juan Antonio Samaranch keeps a
basement office that tells of a man welcomed with deferential
tribute. The octagonal room has the untouched air of a mausoleum
filled with offerings: a silver cup with chrysanthemum crest
presented by the emperor of Japan, an oil painting of Samaranch
from Russia, and, in the entrance, a woven tapestry-portrait
presented by a Kuwaiti sheik.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch earns no salary in his job as president of the
International Olympic Committee, but travels the world like a head
of state. All of his expenses outside Spain _ a modest suite at the
Palace hotel in Lausanne, Switzerland; food, first-class air travel
and so on _ are paid by the Olympic movement or countries hoping to
become host to the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept suites,'' he said of the lavish accommodations
offered by Olympic hopefuls. ``I need a living room.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how much his lifestyle costs the IOC annually, Samaranch
said in an interview: ``I don't know. Hundreds of thousands of
dollars, maybe, millions no. I fly first-class. It's normal. I am
78 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past two months, with the Olympic movement battered by
allegations of corruption at Salt Lake City and elsewhere,
Samaranch has sought to bridge the gap between his retiring
personality and insistent images of uncontrolled indulgence. For
his supporters, he remains a servant of sport who transformed the
Olympics from financial ruin to unimagined prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   But an examination of Samaranch's life, based on interviews in
Europe, Asia and North America, suggests that at the least he had
no enthusiasm for uncovering wrongdoing in the Olympic movement and
may have encouraged it through his own example as he pursued his
consuming goal of broadening and enriching the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Samaranch was not without sufficient information from us and
others to conduct a serious investigation a long time ago,'' said
Norm Seagram, an organizer of the failed Toronto bid for the 1996
Olympics and co-author of a 1991 report to the IOC suggesting that
abuses by IOC members cost the city up to $800,0000. ``But his
response was superficial.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Samaranch dismissed such charges. ``I am
wounded because it is disagreeable to be accused of false things,''
he said. ``We always tried to look into rumors of bad conduct _ but
they were just that, rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   His lips trembled slightly. A proud man, an embattled man, he
was seated in a second Barcelona office, this one on the 23rd floor
of ``La Caixa,'' Spain's biggest savings bank, of which he is
honorary chairman. A room with a sweeping view of the hometown he
transformed by steering the 1992 Olympics here. The bank pays his
expenses when he is here.
</P>
<P>
   Those Summer Games in Barcelona were widely regarded as a
triumph, a reflection of Samaranch's extraordinary transformation
of the Olympics from an event that scarcely anyone wanted to a
coveted money spinner.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that Samaranch ever sought personal
enrichment from this booming Olympics-related business. But more
money slowly brought demands _ for controls and transparency _ that
were unfamiliar to him. IOC members appear to have felt little or
no pressure from their president to resist seductive blandishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mistakes? I don't know about mistakes,'' Samaranch said. ``We
explained clearly what the rules were, we heard some rumors, we
tried to reduce the number of people in the selection process for
Olympic cities, but we could not. Naturally members are attached to
their privileges.''
</P>
<P>
   He has his defenders. Marc Hodler, the veteran Swiss IOC member
and lawyer whose public comments on corruption helped ignite the
current scandal, called Samaranch a ``great president'' who
``achieved unique things by understanding the commercial potential
of the Games.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe so much to him,'' said Anita DeFrantz, the American
vice president of the IOC. ``Women are now members of the IOC. More
women compete in the Olympics. He should be allowed to complete his
job by cleaning things up.''
</P>
<P>
   But a cleanup under public scrutiny is a new notion for
Samaranch. As a government functionary in the the Spain of General
Francisco Franco and as president of the IOC, the Lausanne-based
society that is the ``supreme authority'' of the Olympic Games,
Samaranch has had scant exposure to the strictures of public
accountability. It appears now that this career path may have left
him out of phase with his times.
</P>
<P>
   This was strikingly underscored at an international doping
conference in Lausanne last week, when Samaranch proposed that he
should lead a new global effort to combat athlete drug use. The
suggestion was soundly rejected by European and American
representatives, who seemed stunned that Samaranch had failed to
grasp the precipitous drop in the IOC's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a failure of leadership, unquestionably,'' said
Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the White House drug czar, who attended the
conference. ``The IOC members are merely trustees of the world's
athletes. We want to see democracy, open votes, open meetings, open
books.''
</P>
<P>
   Otto Schily, the German interior minister, was blunter: ``One
should know when to retire from an office,'' he said of Samaranch.
``If one reigns like a constitutional monarch, that is not helpful
for sport.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Tact and Tenacity, With Calculation
</P>
<P>
   But Samaranch said he is determined to fight back. Although
several IOC colleagues have speculated that he might step down
later this year, Samaranch said that his plan is clear: Use an
Olympic committee session next month to shore up his position with
a vote of confidence, reform the organization, and retire in 2001
with his record salvaged.
</P>
<P>
   It is a bold strategy, but Samaranch has been underestimated
before.
</P>
<P>
   Of middling build and modest manner, courteous, attentive to
detail, fanatical about physical fitness, Samaranch quietly builds
bridges and loyalty, edging toward well-defined ambitions with a
mixture of tact and tenacity.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Samaranch has achieved what he sets out to do. Jose
Maria Sumpsi, a longtime friend of the IOC president, showed a
design conceived by Samaranch in the 1960s that featured the shield
of the provincial government of Barcelona above the five-ringed
Olympic symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was done years before Samaranch was president of either
body,'' Sumpsi said, ``but he already knew clearly what he wanted;
then he went for it. In 1973, he became the president of the
Barcelona provincial government. Seven years later, he was
president of the IOC. The vision on this design came true.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for nothing, it seems. Consider Samaranch on the subject of
diplomacy, an art he formally practiced for just three years, as
Spain's ambassador to Moscow between 1977 and 1980:
</P>
<P>
   Know how to listen. Never speak in a language not your own (an
interpreter provides time to think). Convey credibility. Have a
clear objective. Understand that you may not reach your aim in a
straight line. So be ready, when necessary, ``to employ a few
curves.''
</P>
<P>
   These ``curves'' _ roundabout routes to a given target _ have
been a consistent feature of Samaranch's life.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a self-made Barcelona textile baron and a one-time
sportswriter who used the pen name Stick, Samaranch was born to
considerable wealth in 1920. He emerged in the late 1940s as a
passionate sportsman with a particular interest in roller-hockey (a
sort of poor man's ice hockey), and an eye for political
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Dapper, gallant, he earned a reputation as a lady's man of
unfailing solicitude (birthdays duly noted, bouquets always on
time). His wealth was cemented and standing enhanced with his
marriage in 1955 to a Barcelona society beauty, Maria Teresa
Salisachs, whose family money was older than his own.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time he rose steadily in the ranks of Gen. Franco's
Fascist administration, becoming the rough equivalent of a junior
under-secretary of sport and gaining the prestige that allowed him
to join the IOC in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not ashamed of what I did in Spain,'' Samaranch said.
``Franco did good things for my country. He kept us out of World
War II. He created a middle class. He chose a good successor, the
king.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch smoothly navigated Spain's transition from autocratic
to democratic rule after Franco's death in 1975. ``He adapts to
everything,'' said Ernest Lluch, a former Spanish health minister
who knows Samaranch. ``In fact, he is one of the great
chameleons.''
</P>
<P>
   Just two years after Franco's death, Samaranch was named Spain's
first ambassador to Moscow. Already a vice president of the IOC,
Samaranch had a clear aim in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years after joining the IOC in 1966, I had started
thinking about being president,'' he recalled. ``Moscow was
preparing the Olympics of 1980, and I knew that going there would
be a good move for my ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   As it was. When Lord Killanin of Ireland stepped down in 1980,
Samaranch was elected with an absolute majority of 47 votes in the
first round. Hispanic and Soviet-bloc votes helped do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Many, however, saw the presidency as a poisoned chalice.
``Everybody was writing the Olympic obituary,'' said Michael Payne,
a British IOC member who oversees marketing. ``We were politically
and financially bankrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   After the African boycott of the 1976 Summer Games in Montreal,
60 Western nations, led by the United States, boycotted the 1980
Moscow Games over the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Sport seemed
a Cold War victim. The IOC had less than $500,000 in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The Art Of Mollification
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch responded with an extraordinary energy, apparently
driven by his abhorrence of conflict, his Spanish experience of
political reconciliation and his vision of an all-embracing
Olympics. Wherever he could, and by whatever means, he reached out
to extend the Olympic family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has always known how to soften people and he impregnated
the Olympics with this art,'' said Jaume Boix Angelats, the author
of a critical biography of Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   When Angelats was working on his book, the IOC president would
constantly invite him and his co-author on far-flung, expenses-paid
trips to meet him. They declined. ``He wanted us in his debt,''
Angelats said.
</P>
<P>
   Lluch, the former Spanish health minister, produced a Longines
watch given to him by the IOC president after a presentation in
Lausanne of the hospital facilities for Barcelona. ``He just came
up to me and said, `Have a little souvenir.' Funny.''
</P>
<P>
   But whatever its quirks, Samaranch's diplomacy, based on endless
travel, worked. After the Soviet boycott of the Los Angeles Games,
he coaxed 160 of 167 countries then in the Olympic movement to
attend the 1988 Olympics in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first years of his reign, he made more positive,
uplifting changes than all the other IOC presidents put together,''
said John Lucas, an Olympic historian. Among them were rescuing the
Games financially, opening opportunities for women, enabling more
developing nations to compete and bringing professional athletes
into the Games.
</P>
<P>
   But the restless expansion had a price. Olympic awards were
showered on the likes of the East German dictator Erich Honecker
with a view to luring his country to the 1988 Seoul Olympics after
the 1984 boycott, even though he was widely rumored _ and later
discovered _ to be running a state-sponsored doping system.
</P>
<P>
   New IOC members poured in _ more than 80 percent of the current
membership joined under Samaranch. Their credentials were not
always spotless. Maj. Gen. Francis Nyangweso of Uganda became a
member in 1988. He was a former Olympic boxer; he was also an army
commander during Idi Amin's campaign of torture and terror.
</P>
<P>
   An Australian Olympic official has said he paid Nyangweso
$35,000 the night before Sydney won the 2000 Summer Games, beating
Beijing by two votes. The general has denied using the money for
personal use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who do you find in Uganda?'' asked Franklin Servan-Schreiber,
an IOC spokesman. ``Do you want to push for human rights around the
world? That's Amnesty International. Or do you want African
athletes at the Olympic Games?''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch wanted African athletes. In 1986, he brought in
Jean-Paul Ganga of the Congo Republic, a leader of the 1976 African
boycott of the Montreal Games and a strong anti-apartheid
campaigner.

<P>
   The move was prescient: when apartheid collapsed, Ganga helped
steer South Africa back to the 1992 Olympics. But Ganga has since
been accused by the IOC of taking more than $216,000 in illicit
benefits from Salt Lake City. He has denied that his vote on the
2002 site selection was for sale and has said he will protest his
expulsion from the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Samaranch wants to sacrifice his friends,'' Ganga said in an
interview. ``That is dangerous for him. It is war now.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Samaranch appears to have failed is in not perceiving that
making the Olympics bigger _ his unswerving goal _ required
balancing with tighter controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cost-effectiveness and Internet-style openness are concepts
foreign to him,'' said Alberto Montagut, an editor of the Catalan
edition of the newspaper El Mundo. ``Resignation does not exist in
his culture, because it is the act of an accountable type of
management.''

</P>
<P>
   Pools of Money, Yet No Reckoning
</P>
<P>
   For years, management was not much of an issue for the Olympic
movement: there was almost no money to manage.
</P>
<P>
   When Hodler, the Swiss IOC member, joined in the early 1960s, he
recalled that the only revenue was the 40 Swiss francs ($29) paid
each year by members _ providing overall annual revenue of about
$300.
</P>
<P>
   Under Samaranch, however, the quaint poverty of aristocrats and
gentlemen gave way to the rigorously commercialized wealth of
managers of the lucrative five-ringed Olympic brand.
</P>
<P>
   After Peter Ueberroth demonstrated at Los Angeles in 1984 that
clever marketing could make the Olympics profitable, IOC income
from sales of television rights, exclusive corporate sponsorships,
licensing agreements and tickets soared. Worldwide television and
sponsorship rights are now worth $3.5 billion for the 1997-2000
period alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We changed the Olympic movement,'' Samaranch said. ``We made
it universal. We gave it the means to help people. We held one
Olympics after another that was a triumph.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, a lot of people _ many of them poor _ benefited. The
IOC set up a program called Olympic Solidarity in 1961 to promote
the movement by building sports facilities and providing athletic
scholarships around the world. For a long time it had little money.
Now, for the 1997-2000 period, it has $122 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the pools of money created an anachronism at IOC
headquarters in Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly a nongovernmental, nonprofit, private association of
unsalaried men and women _ voting in secret, choosing new members
by co-option, publishing no overall accounts _ was responsible for
hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenue and for choosing
the site of Olympic Games worth fortunes to the cities elected.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic Charter states: ``The Olympic Games are the
exclusive property of the IOC which owns all rights relating
thereto.'' These rights were a gold mine in a world where sport
bred passions once reserved for religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not a corporation,'' Hodler argued. ``We are a club of
friends. And we never had the two-thirds majority necessary to
change the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pound, an IOC vice president from Montreal and the
lawyer who handles television rights sales in the Americas,
conceded that there was still ``very little financial
transparency'' and ``we could do a better job.''
</P>
<P>
   It is by no means clear, however, that Samaranch ever had any
real enthusiasm for steps that might bring that transparency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world of sport changed a lot in recent years,'' he
acknowledged. ``Maybe our mistake was not to change the IOC
statutes. I tried.''
</P>
<P>
   The Samaranch Limited: $7,000 Per Trip
</P>
<P>
   Although he does not vote on the selection of Olympic cities,
contestants for the bids clearly thought it was worthwhile to court
Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   The Nagano Olympic committee laid on a private three-car train
for him in 1991 with a view to winning _ as it did _ the 1998
Winter Games. The train, run by JR East, Japan's largest railroad
company, cost about $7,000 to hire for the trip from a site near
Tokyo to Nagano, a spokesman for JR said.
</P>
<P>
   When in Nagano for the Games, Samaranch was put up at the
Imperial suite of the Kokusai 21 Hotel from Jan 28, 1998 to
February 23, 1998, at a cost of close to $3,000 per night _ or over
$75,0000, a Nagano committee official said. He also received a
Japanese sword and a painting, each valued at about $16,000, Nagano
city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch took the occasion to decorate Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, a
secretive billionaire Japanese businessman with whom he enjoys what
the Tokyo Shimbun describes as a ``honeymoon relationship,'' with
the ``gold Olympic order.''
</P>
<P>
   Tsutsumi had led the battle to bring the Olympics to Nagano _ a
multimillion-dollar campaign whose details have been hidden by the
burning of Nagano's Olympic accounts. He also contributed
substantially to one of Samaranch's pet projects _ the Olympic
museum in Lausanne, opened in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In South Korea, which he has visited more than 25 times since
becoming president, Samaranch has enjoyed another intimate
relationship with a millionaire businessman, Kim Un Yong.
</P>
<P>
   A former bodyguard of the late dictator Park Chung Hee, Kim made
a fortune on land deals south of Seoul's Han river. He went on to
found the World Federation of Tae Kwon Do (Korean karate), before
being elected to the IOC in 1988, the year of the Seoul Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Kim was on the executive committee that chose
the first recipient of the Seoul international peace prize, worth
$300,000. The prize went to Samaranch. Subsequent winners got less:
the prize is worth $20,000 today.
</P>
<P>
   When in Seoul, Samaranch has regularly been housed in the
Presidential suite of the Shilla Hotel (current rate: about $1,700
a night), owned by the Samsung group, whose chairman, Lee Kun Hee,
was elected to the IOC in 1996 after making contributions to the
Olympic movement, Korean officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about these activities, Samaranch said he did not ask for
the train in Japan. And he said he immediately donated all gifts to
the IOC Samaranch did not specifically address the question of the
Samurai sword from Nagano. But an IOC statement said: ``The IOC has
absolutely no record and no recollection of the Samurai sword.''
</P>
<P>
   The $300,000 Seoul prize was given to the Olympic museum,
Samaranch said. He said the generous Asian treatment of him was
acceptable because he does not vote in the selection of Olympic
cities.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems clear that Samaranch's lifestyle provided little
incentive to restraint during the many years that he and other IOC
members say they were trying to instill a new cost-conscious
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never any serious attempt at control, because this
amounts to a secret society where all members pledge to support
each other.'' said Robert Helmick, an American former IOC member
who resigned in 1991 amid allegations of conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch dismissed such allegations, saying ``nothing that
comes from Helmick has any value, because he had to resign.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Members' Hands Were `Not in Their Pockets'
</P>
<P>
   It is Hodler of Switzerland who, for over a decade, has led the
IOC's attempts to reform the bidding process and so curtail Olympic
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   On June 16, 1987, backed by Samaranch, he sent out a letter to
members of the IOC, to national Olympic committees and to candidate
cities, stating that ``gifts of value are not permitted'' and
admonishing IOC members to stay no more than three days in any city
bidding for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   But the letter was clearly ignored.
</P>
<P>
   When Toronto mounted its bid for the 1996 Summer Games in the
late 1980s, it found that ``26 members broke established rules
either by coming with more than one guest, arriving more than once,
or staying more than the allotted time.''
</P>
<P>
   It further found, in a report submitted in January 1991 to
Samaranch and Pound, the IOC vice president, that there was
``blatant abuse'' in travel expenses. IOC members, the report said,
were cashing in first-class tickets and failing to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   These and other practices helped inflate the cost of Toronto's
bid to $14 million. ``The attitude of the IOC members was like the
doorman with his hand half out. You can't quite say the hand is
out, but it's certainly not in his pocket,'' said Seagram.
</P>
<P>
   And what was the response from Samaranch and the IOC? Pound said
that the committee tried to take over co-ordination of travel, and
asked _ orally but not in writing _ for details on the names of
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to react,'' he said, ``But you can't just pick 26
IOC members at random and shoot them.''
</P>
<P>
   Seagram, however, said there was ``no urgency and basically no
further communication'' after the submission of the report.
Samaranch, he said, did mention over dinner the need for names, but
never followed up on this. ``We were surprised and disappointed,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC did little to enforce its rules against gifts. Samaranch
appeared concerned ``not to rock the boat,'' said Sam Ramsamy, the
IOC member from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of IOC action, things evidently went from bad to
worse. When Berlin bid for the 2000 Summer Games, it found 20 IOC
members descending on the city for stays of five or six days and
accepting gifts ranging from porcelain to gold medals at a total
cost _ for the presents alone _ of about $85,000.
</P>
<P>
   A report by Germany's Green Party on the Berlin bid, which was
based on examination of city records, found that travel
arrangements were often exorbitant. One IOC member spent over
$12,000 on his air ticket, stopping in Los Angeles, Madrid,
Tenerife and London, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Isao Ichimura, the secretary general of the Nagano bid
committee, observed how, after a helicopter flight over Nagano
sites, committee members simply walked off with the binoculars they
had been given. ``We couldn't very well say no, although we
expected them back,'' Ichimura said.
</P>
<P>
   In Spain, Leopoldo Rodes, a banker and promoter of Barcelona's
bid for the Games, invited German Rieckehoff, the IOC member from
Puerto Rico, for dinner. A collector of walking sticks, Rieckehoff,
who has since died, stopped on his way out to admire a
silver-topped stick that Rodes kept by his front door.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stick belonged to my grandfather,'' Rodes said, ``but it
was obvious he wanted it, so I gave it to him. That seemed
normal.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Salt Lake City bidding for the 2002 Games began,
the offering of gifts and outright payments _ as well as the use of
agents offering to sell blocs of votes _ had become so entrenched
as to be part of the process.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC estimates that Salt Lake spent $800,000 on 14 IOC
members, including scholarships for children, medical care and cash
payments _ acts under investigation by the United States Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not surprised _ in fact I was relieved _ when the
revelations came out,'' Hodler said. ``There had been smoke around
for years. But the fire was difficult to find.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flame and the Lucre, Side by Side
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch has now become a vociferous advocate of reform. At the
president's insistence, the Olympics acted quickly to sanction
members accused at Salt Lake City, and is pushing for a radical
change in its own structures.
</P>
<P>
   But the IOC president's most cherished project _ the Olympic
museum in Lausanne _ captures the contradictions that may make such
reform difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the museum, which is approached through a faux Greek
colonnade, a flame burns with the inscription ``The Olympic flame
brightens the world.'' Beside it is a sign pointing to the museum's
nearby ``SWATCH'' store. Even here, idealism and commercialism
nestle side by side.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, a movie on Olympic history plays all day. ``In 1980,'' a
voice says, ``Juan Antonio Samaranch was elected. This was a
turning point in Olympic history.'' This is true, of course. But
the statement squares uneasily with Samaranch's professed humility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had a fairly full life,'' he said. ``I look back and
think maybe I made a few mistakes. But I got a few things right. I
tried to be loyal to my friends and I have helped a lot of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   He took out his wallet and extracted some membership cards of
Barcelona clubs. ``I am a man of habits, you see,'' he said.
``Look, I am the third member of the Barcelona tennis club, which
now has thousands of members. I am No. 7 at the Barcelona opera
house club. And No. 88 at the Spanish automobile club.''
</P>
<P>
   So, he was asked, are you an institution? ``No,'' he said, ``I
am an old man. In general people respect me. But there are always a
few exceptions.''  &QL;

POWER IN JORDAN PASSES TO KING HUSSEIN'S SON

   AMMAN, Jordan _ With King Hussein unconscious and near death,
Jordan's government transferred full powers on Saturday to Crown
Prince Abdullah, the 37-year-old heir to the throne, making him
king in all but name.
</P>
<P>
   The decision effectively ended the 47-year-rule of King Hussein,
who was deemed no longer capable of carrying out his duties. The
king's lungs, liver and kidneys have failed, his doctors said
Saturday, and he is being kept alive with a respirator.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanian officials said the hand-over of power was formalized
Saturday morning when Crown Prince Abdullah was sworn in as regent
by Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh after the 22-member Cabinet voted
unanimously to declare the king unfit.
</P>
<P>
   With the transfer, Crown Prince Abdullah, who was designated the
king's heir just 12 days ago, has been invested with the full
constitutional powers of the monarchy, Jordanian officials said.
This means that, effective Saturday morning, Abdullah, the king's
eldest son, has the right to do anything the king might have done,
including mobilizing the military, dismissing the Parliament and
appointing Cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
   A Cabinet minister, Nasser Judeh, said the transfer had been
necessary ``to fill a constitutional vacuum'' left by the king's
precarious medical state. The hand-over, which took place as the
63-year-old king lay unknowing in a military hospital bed, was an
uncharacteristic final chapter to a 47-year reign in which Hussein
clung to power through wars, coups and assassination attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Just 39 months ago, at the funeral of Yitzhak Rabin, the slain
Israeli prime minister, the king told mourners that ``when my time
comes'' he too would prefer to die by an assassin's bullet, as did
his grandfather, King Abdullah. But it is cancer, non-Hodgkins
lymphoma, that is now sapping away what little life the Jordanian
leader has left.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday afternoon, senior Jordanian officials said, the king
had been heavily sedated and unconscious for nearly 72 hours, since
Wednesday, the day before he was flown home from a Minnesota
medical clinic to die in his own country.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the king will be kept on a respirator, a decision that
was reportedly made by other members of the royal family, Marwan
Moasher, Jordan's ambassador to the United States, said Saturday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the respirator, Moasher said, the king has had no
artificial life support.
</P>
<P>
   A brief written statement issued Saturday by the king's doctors,
the first since Hussein arrived back in Jordan early on Friday,
seemed intended to refute reports that he had fallen into a coma or
that he was clinically dead. It described the king as being in
stable condition, and said that his heart and brain functions were
still intact.
</P>
<P>
   But the confirmation that his internal organs had failed was
being interpreted here as grim news. Jordanian officials said that
they did not hold out hope that the king would regain consciousness
and that they expected he would die within hours or days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The constitutional vacuum had to be filled, and particularly
when the doctors report said the king was not in a position to
carry out his responsibilities,'' Judeh, the information minister,
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's Constitution specifies that a regent be designated
during any period in which king cannot carry out his duties.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure has routinely been invoked during the king's
absence from the country; indeed, Crown Prince Abdullah was
designated by his father as regent while the king was away for
last-ditch medical treatment in the United States. But that
designation lapsed with the king's return.
</P>
<P>
   And on Saturday, Cabinet members said that the king's prolonged
unconsciousness and deteriorating condition had left them with no
choice but to take matters into their own hands.
</P>
<P>
   In a curious twist, it was through a very similar procedure that
Hussein, then crown prince, was first proclaimed king, on Aug. 11,
1952, after the Cabinet decided that his father, King Talal, was
mentally unfit to rule.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A grim and sorrowful mood continued to hang over Jordan on
Saturday, with the headline on one newspaper reading ``Sadness,
Tears, and Prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, preparations continued for a state funeral
that is expected to be attended by at least 40 world leaders,
including President Clinton, and by a vast array of other
dignitaries including U.S. congressmen.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the military hospital on the outskirts of Amman where
Hussein is dying, at least 100 people gathered under leaden skies,
some of them joining in a mass prayer for the much-loved king, who
is the only leader most Jordanians have ever known.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the hospital, which bears the king's name, Crown Prince
Abdullah was among members of the royal family at his father's
bedside. A Reuters news agency report, quoting ``a source close to
the royal palace,'' said that family members, including Queen Noor
and the king's sons, had gathered at the hospital on Friday night
to discuss whether to disconnect the respirator, but did not do so
because of differences on religious ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanian officials, including Moasher, sidestepped the issue
when asked to confirm that account, saying that any internal family
deliberations should be kept private.
</P>
<P>
   Moasher was among those who returned to Jordan with the king on
the hasty journey from the United States on Thursday, escorted from
U.S. air space by two fighter planes in a tribute to the
long-serving ruler.
</P>
<P>
   The ambassador said the king was unconscious throughout the
flight, having been heavily sedated so that he could be fitted with
the respirator. But he described the journey as deeply moving.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of Queen Noor, the king's American-born wife,
Moasher said, members of the party had entered King Hussein's room
one by one during the journey ``to pay our respects.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, reports circulated among well-connected Jordanians
all afternoon that the king might soon be moved from his hospital
bed to his home at Beb al-Salam, or Door of Peace, presumably to
die in his own bed. By nightfall, however, there had been no sign
of such a transfer.

Moasher said, members of the party had entered King Hussein's room
one by one during the journey ``to pay our respects.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, reports circulated among well-connected Jordanians
all afternoon that the king might soon be moved from his hospital
bed to his home at Beb al-Salam, or Door of Peace, presumably to
die in his own bed. By nightfall, however, there had been no sign
of such a transfer.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Time was when Linda Chu, a private schoolteacher for
15 years in Manhattan, would not think twice about asking her
students to create family trees, an almost universal
elementary-school project that encourages children to connect with
their ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   But several years ago, Ms. Chu noticed that the assignment was
taking a toll on some of her third graders. She gradually realized
why it was so confounding: The assignment was a drain for children
from nontraditional backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Some students and parents became upset, feeling they had to
choose between charting the biological lineage or the adoptive one.
Some had two mothers or two fathers, or one parent was estranged,
turning an enjoyable assignment into a burden.
</P>
<P>
   So, a few years ago, Ms. Chu made the project more flexible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let them include whoever is important to them instead of
demanding that they fill out the blanks for a mother and father who
may not be there,'' said Ms. Chu, a teacher at Friends Seminary, a
small private school near Gramercy Park.
</P>
<P>
   With many families of the 1990s no longer fitting the
nuclear-family model of the 1950s, teachers like Ms. Chu are
rearranging lesson plans and redrawing assignments long regarded as
staples of the classroom. The revisions reflect the growing
diversity of their schools, which include children from families
created through international adoptions, children of gay parents
and those born through advanced reproductive technology, those in
families broken apart by divorce and rebuilt with stepparents and
stepsiblings, and children raised by relatives or foster parents.
</P>
<P>
   The most entrenched and problematic of these assignments,
teachers, school administrators and psychologists said, is the
classic family tree, which requires children to retrace maternal
and paternal ancestral lines.
</P>
<P>
   How the family tree became such a mainstay in schools is
unclear, but educators said it had its roots in the 1950s, when
two-parent households embodied the ideal postwar American family.
</P>
<P>
   Some educators have reacted to the evolving family
constellations by scrapping the family tree assignment altogether,
while others, like Ms. Chu, have modified it. Teachers now assign
family time lines, family orchards and essays that give children
more freedom in telling their personal histories.
</P>
<P>
   Some teachers have chosen to keep the assignment, saying it is
still a valuable way to study a family's roots. But many schools,
including the Manhattan New School, a public school on the Upper
East Side, now send notes home in advance, asking parents if the
assignment presents a difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Collymore, a single parent who adopted her daughter,
Amara, 6, when the girl was seven weeks old, dreaded the family
tree project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had heard horror stories about it from other adoptive
parents,'' said Ms. Collymore, who lives in White Plains, and works
at a management consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Then in December, Amara, a first-grader at Church Street
Elementary School, came home with the assignment. The instructions
were simple: make a family tree. So were the tools: a cutout tree
and 10 leaves to be pasted with pictures onto construction paper.
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing the matter with Amara, who has been told from
day one that she was adopted, mother and daughter created a tree
with all their loved ones, including Ms. Collymore's parents,
Amara's birth parents, aunts and uncles on Ms. Collymore's side and
even a best friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have used 20 more leaves,'' Ms. Collymore said. ``You
weren't asked to place the leaves in any particular order or how
the person was related to you. It gave us great flexibility, which
is the way it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, family trees were sometimes painful experiences for
certain families _ for example, those whose relatives were killed
in the Holocaust, African-Americans whose ancestors arrived in
America on slave ships and who often care for the children of
relatives and friends through informal arrangements, foster
children and children of divorce.
</P>
<P>
   But the assignment, and the issues it represents, have recently
been questioned more forcefully through the efforts of adoptive
parents.
</P>
<P>
   The impetus has been, in part, that adoptions are no longer
shrouded in secrecy, because of the increase in open adoptions, and
in transracial and international adoptions, psychologists and
educators said.
</P>
<P>
   So children who in previous decades might not have known about
their adoptions, and might therefore have blithely completed these
assignments, now know their adoption stories or have a relationship
with their birth parents, and may struggle with such an inflexible
rendering of their complicated family history.
</P>
<P>
   John Schoonbeck, 55, a retired Vassar College administrator who
is gay, adopted his son, Nicholas, when the boy was born in 1974.
He recalled the family tree assignment as an ``altogether terrible
experience.'' Nicholas, now 25 and married with a 5-year-old
daughter, was assigned the project as a third-grader at a public
school in New Paltz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicky came home from school with bright expectation and this
colorful form to fill out for his family tree,'' Schoonbeck said.
``When I told him we couldn't do our family that way, he was sure
there had to be something wrong with us, not with the school's
request. He was hurt and suspicious, and I was furious at the
school.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, father and son completed only the paternal side of
the tree and prayed that the teacher would not say anything. She
did not.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In lectures to educators, Joyce Maguire Pavao, executive
director of the Center for Family Connections and founder of the
Pre/Post Adoption Consulting Team, both in Cambridge, Mass., offers
an alternative to the family tree assignment: family orchards.
</P>
<P>
   ``A variation like an orchard or a wheel that shows everyone
children are connected to is good,'' she said. ``But it's a much
more complicated assignment than people think for African-American
children, relatives of victims of the Holocaust or some child who
spent his or her first 10 years in a Romanian orphanage, because
they can only go back so far.''
</P>
<P>
   But some teachers have refused to modify the family tree
assignment, saying there is no substitute for traditional
genealogical research.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Waggoner, a fourth-grade teacher at Elmore Elementary
School in Green Bay, Wis., is a family tree stalwart. The project
is a major undertaking for him and his students, requiring parental
involvement and document research. He and his students pore over
records, including birth and marriage certificates, to find
ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not let the children do a family line on
step-parents,'' Waggoner said in a telephone interview. ``No matter
how much they love the person, they are not part of a child's
ancestry. It would not be a true family tree. If parents disagree,
we usually reach a compromise by allowing the child to trace one of
their parent's history.''
</P>
<P>
   The family tree project usually falls under immigration or
family studies in the third or fourth grades. In some cases, family
trees are studied in middle school, high school and even college.
But the agony of feeling different resonates more deeply for
elementary school children, said Susan Davis, a child and family
psychologist in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and other child development professionals say the family
tree assignment has endured because children love learning about
themselves and enjoy interviewing family members about the days
before they were born. The assignment also helps children
understand the continuity of generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``But children need to have a choice,'' Davis said, ``defining
the family configuration that makes sense to them and doesn't limit
them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   About 15 years ago, teachers at the Bank Street School, a
progressive private school in Manhattan, began moving away from the
rigid family tree model because the school started to attract a
more diverse student body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had kids talk openly about coming from sperm banks or
having two moms,'' said George Burns, head of the middle school at
Bank Street. ``What tends to happen is that children pick up on how
a parent or teacher talks about it. Do they use a tone of
acceptance?''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Bank Street permits students to incorporate whomever they
wish into family trees, and gives them even more freedom to
highlight significant events in their lives by creating time lines
illustrated with drawings and photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers can avoid making children feel uncomfortable about
their backgrounds, particularly when doing assignments about family
ties, by assuming that most students come from complex families,
said Ronny Diamond, director of post-adoption services at
Spence-Chapin Services to Families and Children, an adoption agency
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Diamond conducts workshops at public and private schools in
the region, instructing teachers and administrators in how to
handle issues of adoption, what language to use and how to make
their assignments more sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, she said, teachers unwittingly hurt adopted
children's feelings through the family tree assignment, either by
sending them out of the room under the guise of doing something
special or by telling them not to do their ``real'' family, just
their adoptive parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the teachers are trying to make things easier,'' Ms.
Diamond said, ``but it's all unnecessary if they allow a little
flexibility and become more aware of their language.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Rogers, a single adoptive mother from South Orange, N.J.,
said she was flummoxed when her daughter, Kendra, now 6, came home
with the family tree assignment as a 3-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rogers, a friend of Ms. Collymore, the single mother in
White Plains, said she had never revealed to teachers at Kendra's
Montessori school that her daughter was adopted, fearing the
negative myths about adoption that people might attach to her
child. How then would she list Kendra's father?
</P>
<P>
   ``I put my nephew in that slot,'' said Ms. Rogers, 46, a
hospital administrator. ``He is her godfather. Interestingly
enough, no one in the school asked about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Render Brown trains new teachers at Wheelock College in
Boston, and she urges them to talk to parents and read students'
records to help them create lessons that include all types of
families. She also advises teachers to tackle family diversity
through children's literature.
</P>
<P>
   One children's author, Patricia Polacco, has carved out a niche
writing books that highlight multiculturalism and show, in a
nondidactic way, grandmothers and single mothers as heads of their
households.
</P>
<P>
   As a child of divorce herself, Ms. Polacco, 54, said that she
knows the importance of seeing nontraditional families in
children's literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teachers are not only aware, but they talk to me about it as a
visiting author,'' said Ms. Polacco, who speaks in classrooms
around the country. ``They have parents who are gay couples, and
they want students to see their faces on the pages. One of my best
friends is an African-American man who said that when he was
growing up, no one on book pages looked like him. I've tried to
change that with my stories. Now, there's glorious literature that
addresses all races and all different family life styles.''

NEW JORDANIAN LEADER'S FIRST TEST LIES IN INTERNAL POLITICS
</HEADLINE>
 (See also JORDAN-HUSSEIN, JORDAN-CANCER, JORDAN-HISTORY-REVIEW) 
(bl) 
By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ As Crown Prince Abdullah formally took charge of
Jordan's government Saturday, experienced observers here said that
internal political challenges _ rather than foreign-affairs crises
_ are likely to present the new leader with his first tests.
</P>
<P>
   Ratified by the Jordanian Cabinet on Saturday as the regent, or
acting monarch, the 37-year-old crown prince now has the
constitutional power to appoint Cabinet ministers, call elections,
and command the army, in which he has spent most of his adult life.
</P>
<P>
   While few analysts here anticipate major political crises in the
first months of the crown prince's rule, they say he will still
have to move in short order to replace at least a few members of
the current Cabinet, including the unpopular prime minister, Fayez
Tarawneh, the 55th of King Hussein's parade of politically weak
Cabinet chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Abdullah voiced his own desire for
what he called ``comprehensive changes,'' including new free-market
reforms and further _ albeit gradual and guided _ democratization.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the first direct challenge to the new ruler, the
opposition Muslim Brotherhood party last week asked to meet with
the crown prince to present its demands for the dissolution of
Parliament and new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Complaining of state media strictures and alleged threats
against its candidates, the Islamist party boycotted the last
general election in 1997, leaving the Parliament with almost no
opposition representation.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslim Brotherhood's unyielding opposition to Jordanian
peace agreements with Israel is only one point of contention. The
party is also a fierce populist defender of subsidies on staple
foods. These subsidies were recently eliminated by the financially
pressed government, setting off riots last year.
</P>
<P>
   Officials who know Abdullah expect him to agree to a request for
a dialogue with the Islamist opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``His style is to pursue a policy of inclusion rather than a
policy of exclusion,'' said Rima Khalaf, a former planning minister
who worked closely with the crown prince on several projects in the
past. ``That should determine the way he deals with the Muslim
Brotherhood and other so-called opposition groups. He is a unifier
by nature.''
</P>
<P>
   But to accede to the Muslim Brotherhood demand for a dissolution
of Parliament could be a risk not worth taking until Abdullah has
consolidated his own hold on power. The current Parliament will
adjourn in March, and, as is customary in Jordan, is not scheduled
to reconvene until October. ``That could buy Abdullah some time,''
said one politician, who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah is universally expected to adhere scrupulously to
constitutional procedures for any government personnel changes.
``The Constitution has been respected all through this ordeal, as
you are all aware,'' said Information Minister Nasser Judeh on
Saturday morning in a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a country of solid institutions,'' Judeh said. ``This
is a country of continuity.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if broad policies and institutions are unlikely to
change, there is general agreement that the new government cannot
simply continue with the current cast of political characters.
``The real question is when,'' said one former top official.
</P>
<P>
   The most sensitive immediate issue is the fate of senior
officials who owe their positions to Abdullah's uncle, Prince
Hassan, who served as crown prince for 34 years and has especially
great influence in the critical foreign and finance ministries.
</P>
<P>
   If the new ruler is seen to be moving too quickly to replace
Hassan loyalists it could be viewed as an unseemly vendetta. Yet a
failure to install some of his own appointees might be
misinterpreted as a sign of weakness, hampering Abdullah's ability
to rule, political observers said.
</P>
<P>
   The best early indicator of how the crown prince intends to
handle this dilemma may be Judeh himself, the son-in-law of Prince
Hassan. Judeh has been severely criticized for the paucity of state
media coverage of the King's health and plans for the succession.
Most Amman professionals say they have been following the events on
foreign radio and cable television.
</P>
<P>
   Critics saw Judeh's press conference Saturday as the most recent
case in point.
</P>
<P>
   After summoning hundreds of foreign and Jordanian reporters to
what was billed as the first public briefing on the king's health
by the king's doctor, Judeh read a brief official opening
statement, declined to answer questions about the king on the
grounds that the physician would be better equipped to respond.
</P>
<P>
   The information minister then departed, leaving an assistant to
explain to reporters that the doctor would not address the
reporters after all, but a bulletin would be distributed instead.
Hours later, the bulletin had not appeared.

 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The framers of the Declaration of Independence, in
keeping with the practice of the day, wrote the formal document on
parchment rather than paper so that it would last longer. But
surely few thought that the text they wrote would survive for more
than two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Today, another group of framers confronts the precious
documents. They are scientists, engineers, designers and
archivists, and they will soon begin constructing new encasements
and frames to protect the texts on which the nation is based.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the National Archives and Records Administration is
expected to unveil the design of the new enclosures, airtight cells
of titanium and aluminum that will hold the documents behind
tempered glass in an atmosphere of inert argon gas. The
encasements, resembling large, deep picture frames, will replace
similar enclosures that were made almost 50 years ago and appear to
be prematurely deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
   The integrity of the protective cases is significant because
they hold the foundation documents of the country, known as the
Charters of Freedom. These are the original, parchment sheets on
which are written the Declaration of Independence, the U.S.
Constitution and its first 10 amendments, known as the Bill of
Rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Charters, as they are called, have made the National
Archives building one of Washington's most popular tourist
attractions. Each year, more than 1.2 million visitors wait in long
lines to file solemnly by the documents displayed in the building's
rotunda.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for new encasements arose four years ago when
conservators noticed subtle changes within the sealed,
bronze-framed glass enclosures that have held the documents since
1952. Their observations confirmed hints, first noticed in a 1988
examination, of possible changes that could affect the parchment
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Inspections of the Bill of Rights under special lights showed a
haziness in areas where the parchment made contact with an inner
pane of glass in the case. By 1995, the hazy areas, possible
evidence of unwanted chemical reactions, were becoming more
pronounced. Similar, but less noticeable, changes were detected on
the Declaration of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, conservators found tiny white flakes in the
enclosures, believed to be salts coming out of the glass because of
higher than expected humidity in the enclosures.
</P>
<P>
   Norvell M. Jones, chief of the Archives Document Conservation
Branch, said a committee of outside advisers to the agency
concluded that there was no immediate danger to the documents, but
recommended that planning begin for new encasements. ``When we
discovered that the charters had to be re-encased, we saw it as an
opportunity to plan for some other things that needed to be done
with the documents,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The display area in the rotunda of the Archives building is
designed for only four of the seven pages of Charter documents to
be shown at a time, Jones said, with the Declaration of
Independence, the Bill of Rights and the first and last pages of
the Constitution usually on view. The transmittal page to the
Constitution and two middle pages are rarely seen, she said, but
the new plans call for all of them to be encased and displayed.
</P>
<P>
   Archive officials and conservationists also are concerned about
the daily movement of the display pages to and from their bombproof
vault below the rotunda, a source of vibrations that eventually
could deteriorate the parchment sheets and the brittle ink on their
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Planning has begun to redesign the display area to make it more
accessible to the disabled, to exhibit all of the Charter pages at
once, and to secure the documents in an off-hours protective area
that reduces their daily movement.
</P>
<P>
   But designs for the new encasements must be completed before
renovations can be planned around them, officials said. The
encasement project gained momentum when it drew the attention of
the Clinton administration's millennium project, an effort headed
by Hillary Rodham Clinton to save the nation's historic treasures
by the turn of the century. The Pew Charitable Trusts, a foundation
in Philadelphia, donated $800,000 last year to pay for designing
and testing new enclosures.
</P>
<P>
   The Archives selected Heery International, an engineering and
architectural firm, as prime contractor for designing the
encasements and turned to the National Institute of Standards and
Technology, known as NIST, to test and manufacture them. NIST, part
of the Commerce Department, is the former National Bureau of
Standards, the agency that built the original Charter enclosures
five decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Richard Judson, an engineer who is the Archives' project manager
for the encasements, said the existing cases were state of the art
for 1950s technology and appear to have worked fairly well.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very nicely done and appear to have maintained most
of their integrity,'' he said. ``But looking back with 50 years of
hindsight, our approach today is somewhat different.''
</P>
<P>
   The older cases consist of a sandwich of three panes of glass.
There is a pane on the bottom, topped by a sheet of pure
cellulose-backing paper on which the document rests, and a thin
glass cover resting atop the parchment to hold it flat. This is
followed by an empty space and a top sheet of glass.
</P>
<P>
   Having a glass sheet touching the parchment itself is the
biggest problem with the old case, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the enclosure was sealed, air was pumped out and it was
filled with pure helium and enough water vapor to produce a
relative humidity inside of 25 to 35 percent. An inert gas is used
in such encasements to purge its atmosphere of oxygen, which
encourages chemical reactions, and impurities.
</P>
<P>
   Parchment, which is stretched and cured animal skin treated to
remove acidity, requires some moisture to keep it from becoming
brittle. Too much water, however, can cause this durable material
to swell and contract and can promote the growth of organisms.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists suspect that more moisture may have been sealed
into the original enclosures than intended, perhaps from the newly
made cellulose-backing paper. Relative humidities above 40 percent
can encourage salt crystals to leach out of older glass, a possible
source of some of the deterioration seen in the old enclosures,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   The Archives established more than 20 criteria for the new
encasements, including high visibility for the documents, weight
limits to allow lifting by two people, the ability to open and
reseal the cases, and a pleasing, dignified appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Norbert S. Baer, a professor of conservation at New York
University and chairman of the committee of outside experts that
advises the Archives, said the new design reflects a philosophical
change from the 1950s. The old enclosures were not designed to be
reopened, he said, and experts then expressed confidence that their
technology would protect the documents for 100 years or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we know more, but have a greater sense of the limits of
technology,'' Baer said. ``Now you recognize that things can go
wrong you haven't anticipated, and you allow for getting into the
enclosure without destroying it if something troubling occurs.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Engineers have settled on a design that starts with a solid
metal base made of aluminum or titanium, with sections milled out
of the bottom to reduce weight, giving the base a waffle
appearance. A final decision on which metal to use has yet to be
made.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the well of this base sits a thin, perforated aluminum
document platform that stands about an inch high on three posts.
This platform is detachable so that it and the attached document
can be removed from the enclosure if it is disassembled.
</P>
<P>
   The document is to rest on a piece of pure cellulose paper, and
both will be affixed to the platform with thin, clear polyester
film clips that exert almost no pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Covering the enclosure and sitting atop the base is a two-layer
sheet of tempered glass bonded with a layer of plastic to resist
shattering.
</P>
<P>
   The enclosure is secured with a titanium metal frame that clamps
the glass against the seal ring when 80 bolts are screwed through
the base into the frame and tightened.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie E. Smith, a chemist who directs materials science work at
NIST, the standards institute, said argon will be used instead of
helium in the enclosure because it is easier to handle and has a
bigger molecule, which is less likely to diffuse out of the
enclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Relative humidity in the new cases will be kept at 40 percent,
slightly higher than planned for the old enclosures, because that
more closely matches conditions outside the cases if they have to
be opened, he said. This helps prevent shock to the document under
these circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The institute's engineers, led by Richard Rhorer and Christopher
Evans, have built a manufacturing model of the casement for testing
in the spring before making a prototype.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers are also sending samples of titanium, which has a gray
finish, to metal-coating companies to see if the tough metal can be
given the bronze color desired for the frame. Rhorer said it was
unclear whether anodization, an electrolytic process that can put a
colored, oxide film on metal, will be able to produce the color and
tone that designers want.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows how many interests are involved in this project,''
he said. ``We normally don't have to be concerned if the color of a
metal is `warm' enough and such things.''
</P>
<P>
   The standards institute is to make nine new encasements, seven
to house the documents and two backups. Two of the cases will be
slightly larger than the others, measuring 39\ inches tall, 37~
inches wide and 3 1/6 inches deep, because the Bill of Rights is
larger than the other documents. The other cases will be the same
height and depth but 33| inches wide.
</P>
<P>
   After testing, the prototype, containing the transmittal page of
the Constitution, will be unveiled in the summer of 2000. The
permanent encasements, containing the seven Charter documents, are
expected to go on display in 2003.

 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., remembered the way the
two leaders, seated side by side, leaned in close to each other
during the bipartisan caucus in the old Senate chamber last month.
They were ``whispering and giggling,'' Gorton said, like the
fastest of friends.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., recalled the many occasions over the
last few weeks that a meeting with one of the leaders was
interrupted by an impromptu telephone call to or from the other.
``Both senators like each other,'' Leahy said, citing that as one
reason that ``the Senate didn't spin out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances did not always promote it. The odds were often
against it. But amid the partisan fires of the impeachment and
trial of President Clinton, the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott
of Mississippi, and the minority leader, Tom Daschle of South
Dakota, managed to forge a better relationship than they had ever
had before.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews this week, fellow senators, aides to Lott and
Daschle and the two leaders themselves said that it was an
assiduous effort, an attempt to fashion an amulet against a
protracted, rancorous proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Although it failed on numerous occasions, as deals collapsed and
votes split along strictly partisan lines, senators said the amity
achieved by Lott and Daschle was perhaps the main reason the trial
could end within the next week. They said that the leaders' example
also boded well for the legislative session to come, providing a
beacon of bipartisan harmony in a Congress starved for it in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daschle and Lott speak more in one day than Gephardt and
Gingrich spoke in one year,'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La.,
referring to Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., the House minority
leader, and Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., whose nearly four-year tenure as
speaker of the House ended with his resignation in November.
</P>
<P>
   Lott and Daschle talk in person, dropping into each other's
office without invitation or hesitation. They talk in the chamber,
rushing into private huddles when tempers flare across the aisle.
They talk on the phone, ringing each other at home or using a
special line reserved for calls between their Capitol offices.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said that on perhaps their most grueling and
disappointing day, when Democrats and Republicans failed to
negotiate an agreement on a bipartisan plan for proceeding or
bypassing the depositions of three witnesses, Lott actually found a
way to reach Daschle in the middle of a Democratic caucus.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called me on my cell phone just to tell me he couldn't do
it,'' Daschle said, referring to Lott's attempt to fashion some
consensus between the parties. Daschle added that he considered
that heads-up not only a crucial courtesy but also ``a pretty good
illustration of how we manage to get along despite all of this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fond of him,'' Daschle said in an interview this week. ``I
think he's been upfront and fair with me, even when he hasn't been
able to produce.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott praised Daschle in similar terms. ``We've had a good
relationship, one where we've been honest with each other,'' Lott
said in an interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you go through a crucible like this, whether it's
boot camp or pledge week or freshman year, you get closer,'' Lott
said. ``In an odd way, I think the entire Senate, Republicans and
Democrats, may have a better understanding of each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators from both parties said that the leaders had indeed
benefited from being thrown together, for days on end, with a
strong motivation to talk to each other and try to find common
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it eluded them as often as not, senators predicted
that the leaders and other members of the Senate would emerge from
the trial with a greater sensitivity toward each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just Trent and Tom,'' said Sen. Mitch McConnell,
R-Ky., ``Oddly enough, though we've had a lot of partisan votes,
it's been a bonding experience.''
</P>
<P>
   In the cases of Lott and Daschle, senators said, it was also an
experience that both leaders knew would define their political
careers _ and their political legacies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both realized that there would never be a test of their
leadership, in their whole career, that would begin to match, in
its stakes, the impeachment trial of a president,'' Leahy said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, agreed. ``I think they realized
that communication between them would be an essential ingredient in
maintaining the integrity of the process,'' Ms. Snowe said.
</P>
<P>
   They put a high price on politesse, as well. On more than one
occasion, Lott and Daschle gave joint interviews, yielding the
microphone back and forth to each other in a chivalrous
news-conference equivalent of ``After you, my dear Alphonse.''
</P>
<P>
   When they spoke separately, expressing Republican and Democratic
positions at odds with each other, they often granted each other
personal amnesty, insisting that there had been earnest stabs at a
compromise, genuine bids for conciliation.
</P>
<P>
   It was a striking departure from the past. Leahy said that as
recently as a year ago, some of the sniping between Lott and
Daschle was so intense that he pulled them both aside.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers and political officials who are close to Lott and
Daschle said that a particular source of friction was Daschle's
belief that Lott sometimes promised more than he could deliver,
getting too far in front of a sprawling, brawling Republican caucus
that he could not always control.
</P>
<P>
   But Daschle said that during the trial, he felt sympathy for the
challenges Lott faced in dealing with the more conservative members
of his conference. Daschle added that if it had been up to Lott
alone, bipartisan resolutions might have been possible from the
very beginning of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a very difficult set of circumstances,'' Daschle
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders do not socialize away from the Capitol and are
in many ways different. Lott, once the head cheerleader at the
University of Mississippi, is more of a performer; Daschle, a
former Air Force intelligence officer, is introverted to the point
of sometimes appearing meek.
</P>
<P>
   But they both come from similar middle-class backgrounds,
graduated to the Senate from the House and are relatively close in
age. Lott is 57. Daschle is 51.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Bob Dole, Lott's predecessor as majority leader, is
more than 20 years older than Daschle, and several senators said
that Dole seldom struck up casual, unplanned conversations with
Daschle.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., the minority whip, said Lott and
Daschle had ``a much closer relationship, in terms of how they
talk; they talk at least three times a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said: ``One of the things that has happened between Tom and
me, and it's affected the Senate a little bit, is that we are a
different generation, a younger generation. We have a little
different style.''
</P>
<P>
   One Democratic aide remembered a day during the impeachment
trial when Daschle was holding a meeting with a half-dozen other
Democratic senators in a conference room and Lott popped into
Daschle's outer office unannounced.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle, unperturbed, left the meeting for a few minutes to talk
to him and then brought Lott back into the conference room with him
to chat briefly with the other senators, the aide said. When Lott
left, the aide said, he warmly promised not to make an announcement
about an unspecified development until Daschle said it was all
right.
</P>
<P>
   With the Republicans bucking public sentiment by even holding a
trial, Lott clearly appreciates his investment in keeping it civil,
and he has repeatedly tried to placate Daschle, even when
Republicans were marching in a direction that displeased Democrats,
which was much of the time.
</P>
<P>
   On the evening when Republicans voted to depose three witnesses,
Lott added language to the motion that conditionally gave veto
power to Daschle over the depositions of any additional witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Adhering to the unwritten rules of their apparent pact of mutual
nonaggression, Daschle later spared Lott the wrath he expressed at
the Republican course in general.
</P>
<P>
   Facing television cameras after the vote, he even went so far as
to thank Lott. ``I appreciate very much Sen. Lott's willingness to
consider many of the concerns we had,'' Daschle said.

LYMPHOMA UNPREDICTABLE IN ITS NATURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also JORDAN-HUSSEIN, JORDAN-PRINCE, JORDAN-HISTORY-REVIEW) 
(rk) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the cancer from which King Hussein of
Jordan is near death at age 63, comes in many forms. While the
prognosis varies significantly according to the type, any form can
act unpredictably.
</P>
<P>
   Some such cancers wax and wane over years. Many people live for
decades, hardly bothered by their lymphoma. Some may not need
treatment for long periods.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many others, like the king, develop a form that is highly
aggressive, and succumb swiftly even after they have an apparently
successful bone marrow transplant and other powerful but risky
therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Lymphomas are cancers of the lymphatic system, which plays a key
role in the body's immune defenses. Because the lymphatic system
consists of channels that course through the body like blood
vessels, the cancer has a ready route to spread to any organ and
tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have long arbitrarily divided lymphomas into two types:
Hodgkin's disease (named for Thomas Hodgkin of London, who first
described it as a new disease in 1832) and a dozen other forms
grouped as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Classification of non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma can be confusing because different systems are used.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein's cancer is believed to be the most common type, known
as B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. His demise comes less than eight
months after the diagnosis was first made at the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, he had lost weight, was tired and his lymph nodes,
normally the size of a pea, had become enlarged.
</P>
<P>
   Like many cancers, King Hussein's initially responded
dramatically to large amounts of anti-cancer drugs. Then, to give
him the best chance of a cure, cells were taken from his body and
stored for what is known as an autologous stem cell transplant.
</P>
<P>
   In the procedure, he received huge amounts of drugs to kill the
cancer cells. But the drugs also killed the king's own healthy
blood cells. So a few days after the chemotherapy regimen was
completed, the king received his own cells to supply oxygen and
defend against infection while his own bone marrow healed and began
to make its own cells. That process took several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   More surprising to many people is that on Jan. 19, Hussein made
a triumphal return to Jordan and said he was completely recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The news was reassuring to his people because in 1992 the king
had recovered from cancer of the ureter for which doctors at the
Mayo Clinic removed his left kidney.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the optimism was misplaced. King Hussein took a
sudden turn for the worse. He developed a fever and his blood
counts dropped to dangerous levels. That was evidence that the
cancer had come back surprisingly fast.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 26, hours after changing the line of succession,
removing his brother and naming his eldest son as heir to the
throne, the king flew back to the Mayo Clinic, where he had spent
the last six months of 1998 except for brief periods. Platelets
were injected into his veins on the flight to prevent bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   The news at the Mayo Clinic was grimmer than ever. King Hussein
was riddled with lymphoma. With precious little reserve in his
body, the few drugs left to treat his cancer posed enormous
dangers. He started chemotherapy again, but his cancer was
uncontrollable.
</P>
<P>
   The last desperate hope was a second bone marrow transplant.
</P>
<P>
   The king underwent the procedure on Monday and Tuesday, using
cells from a sibling. But it was unsuccessful. Hours later, as the
king's liver and other organs began to fail, he became unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   When bone marrow transplants are unsuccessful, the liver often
fails due to the effects of the drugs, cancer, infection, or a
complication known as veno-occlusive disease that blocks the flow
of blood in the liver.
</P>
<P>
   The king wanted to die at home. So a tube was put into his
windpipe and connected to a mechanical respirator to help his
breathing on his last flight.
</P>
<P>
   In such situations, if the family wishes, doctors administer
drugs to sustain the blood pressure and heart beat. But ultimately,
the cancer wins as the heart stops beating or the family agrees to
end life-support therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Many other political leaders and celebrities have succumbed to
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Among them are: Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi
of Iran; former Sen. Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts; former CIA
Director William J. Casey; Jozsef Antall, who led Hungary after the
Communists; and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 56,000 Americans and tens of thousands of people
elsewhere are expected to develop non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The
disease has been one of the fastest-rising cancers in the United
States and elsewhere, although the rate has slowed in this country
in the last few years, according to the American Cancer Society.

   Three factors can explain about a third of the recent rise. One
is the AIDS virus, HIV, which somehow increases the risk of this
cancer. A second is the rising number of recipients of transplanted
organs and tissues, who are at increased risk for lymphoma because
of the anti-rejection drugs they take. A third is improved
diagnostic techniques.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For their parents and grandparents, who watched stocks
crash and banks fail, the government was considered the salvation
of a generation that had been betrayed by the financial markets.
But for today's aging baby boomers, who face increasing concerns
about the solvency of Social Security and other federal retirement
programs, it is now the government that cannot be trusted and a
bullish Wall Street that provides some hope.
</P>
<P>
   That dynamic, detected in public-opinion polls and a score of
recent interviews with baby boomers on Atlanta's streets, may
become a critical component of the debate over the future of Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   As the 76.5 million Americans born from 1946 to 1964 move toward
retirement, they are decidedly skeptical about the capacity of the
government to uphold its end of the Social Security bargain, the
polls and interviews suggest. And the same cynicism about the
government also makes many question the wisdom of President
Clinton's recent proposal to save Social Security from bankruptcy
by having the government invest hundreds of billions of dollars in
the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that they distrust the stock market's ability to yield
greater returns than the low-interest bonds that have long been the
government's investment of choice for the Social Security trust
fund. It is that they distrust the government's ability to invest
the money prudently and without political influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see the federal government being that big a player in
the stock market,'' said Kevin Green, a 36-year-old lawyer who was
taking a break in a downtown park. ``And I can't see that much
money being independently invested without the various interest
groups having some significant say about how it's invested.''
</P>
<P>
   George Watson, a 51-year-old federal court worker, said he had
only ``50-50'' confidence that the money he had paid in Social
Security taxes would come back to him as promised retirement
benefits. And he acknowledged that investing a share of Social
Security reserves in the stock market could provide some
protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the question for me,'' Watson said, ``is who chooses what
stocks. With all the scandals and fiddling around in Washington, I
think that's something that would have to be watched. I don't know
if I trust those people.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those interviewed by pollsters said they preferred a
Republican plan that would allow individuals to invest part of
their Social Security taxes in stock funds they chose.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Republican plan say they fear that it would
exacerbate financial inequity among Americans, with those who
understand the stock market benefiting far more than those who do
not. But the plan's admirers say that they like it because, unlike
the Clinton proposal, it would be founded on self-reliance rather
than faith in the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trust myself more than I do the government,'' said Debi
Lenox, 48, an interior designer from the south Atlanta suburb of
Peachtree City who was shopping at Lenox Square, one of Atlanta's
upscale malls. ``It's OK if you invest your own money, but playing
with other people's money isn't wise.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those interviewed acknowledged that their attitudes
toward the government and the financial markets differed markedly
from those of their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came out of the Depression trusting the government,''
said Larry Britt, 47, an engineer from Oxford, Miss., who was
attending a meeting in Atlanta. ``It was all they had to fall back
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Britt's wife, Mary Ann, 47, an innkeeper, said her parents were
so distrustful of the stock market that they never would have
supported the investment of retirement money in equities,
regardless of who was doing the investing. She said they were not
concerned about the paltry rate of return on the government's
investment of Social Security taxes in bonds, which have yielded an
average of 2 percent to 2.5 percent annually since the taxes were
first collected in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   She said, ``they would have seen that two-and-a-half percent and
thought that it was fine, that it's safe, it's secure and it'll
grow at a steady rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social
Security Act in 1935, that slow, steady growth has been sufficient
to sustain the retirement system. But as the baby boomers mature,
and as medical advances extend life expectancy, the system's tax
receipts will no longer be able to support its obligations. The
Social Security trust fund is projected to run out of money in 2032
if changes are not made.
</P>
<P>
   An array of recent polls show that Americans steadfastly oppose
propping up the system by increasing taxes, reducing payments or
raising the retirement age. And the polls show only modest support
for measures that would burden upper-income Americans, like raising
the amount of earnings that are subject to Social Security payroll
taxes or reducing benefits for those with high retirement incomes.
That has left politicians with few alternatives beyond seeking to
increase the yield on Social Security reserves.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the Union address in January, Clinton proposed
earmarking more than half of the projected federal budget surpluses
_ $2.7 trillion of the $4.4 trillion surplus anticipated over the
next 15 years _ for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $2.7 trillion, he would invest about $700 billion in
stocks in an effort to capture the robust returns that have become
commonplace on Wall Street. The administration maintains that its
plan would make the Social Security system solvent until 2055.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans generally support the concept of dedicating a
significant portion of the surpluses to Social Security. But they
have expressed concern about the government playing such a heavy
role in the free enterprise system, a factor that also deeply
troubles Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. The
administration estimates that the government would come to own 4 to
5 percent of the value of all shares of publicly traded companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans propose that workers be allowed to divert a
share of their Social Security taxes into private investment
accounts, which they could manage themselves.
</P>
<P>
   That appeals to many Americans who fear that the stock market's
current pace cannot be sustained and who believe that the
government should not be taking financial risks that may be
acceptable for individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know much about the market, but I know it's not always
going to make 20 percent,'' said John Zimmerman, a 38-year-old
geologist in Atlanta for the federal Environmental Protection
Agency. ``Maybe some of the money should be put in there. But
frankly, what I'd really like to see is for the government to give
me everything I've put into the system. Let me manage my own money
and I promise you I won't ask the government for help when I
retire.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of those interviewed, however, said that many Americans
would not have the financial expertise to invest wisely on their
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it would work because a lot of people don't have
a good knowledge of how the stock market works and they could lose
a lot of money,'' said Rod Jackson, 38, a maintenance man at a
downtown Atlanta office building. ``I'd want the money put into a
savings account. It's much safer and the money would be
guaranteed.''
</P>
<P>
   One point agreed on by virtually all of the baby boomers
interviewed was that they, unlike their parents, could not depend
on Social Security to support their retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be every person for themselves,'' said
Green, the lawyer. ``I don't feel secure at all.''

 &HT;    Prophet and profit-maker: Andy Young
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Gary Pomerantz and Jane Hansen
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's a long way from Selma to Angola.
</P>
<P>
   It's even longer from negotiating for civil rights with the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s to now consulting in Africa for
American corporations such as Chevron Oil.
</P>
<P>
   That's the A-to-Z metamorphosis in the public life of Andy Young
_ minister, congressman, ambassador, mayor; Atlanta's most
passionate civic salesman since Henry Grady; Olympic idealist; and
unifier of peoples and continents.
</P>
<P>
   It's a span that measures more than 30 years and a series of
controversies, from his unauthorized meeting with the Palestine
Liberation Organization to his tepid support for Nike's operations
in Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
   Where once Young reached out to Southern whites in the name of
civil rights, now he reaches out to black African nations in the
name of American companies.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 66, and living with his second wife, Carolyn, in
the same southwest Atlanta home he bought for $32,000 in 1967, Andy
Young has morphed again.
</P>
<P>
   He's become Corporate Andy, honing in on Africa, ``the missing
link in the global economy,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He flew about a million miles last year, commands up to $25,000
for a speech (although he speaks for free to black colleges) and
earns more than $200,000 annually for sitting on a handful of
corporate boards, including those of Host Marriott, Delta, Cox
Communications and Archer-Daniels-Midland.
</P>
<P>
   He also serves as unpaid chairman of the Southern Africa
Enterprise Fund _ $100 million designated for economic development
in 11 African nations. President Clinton appointed him to the
position in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our man in the United States'' is how South Africa's retired
Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu describes him.
</P>
<P>
   Young says he spends about 10 days a month in Africa, where he
puts to use his extraordinary network of connections developed
during the decades.
</P>
<P>
   He keeps a hectic, if lucrative, pace; the most exercise he gets
these days is lifting luggage into the overhead compartments on
airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided that there wasn't anybody else (in the U.S.) that
knew as many people in Africa as I did and that also knew as much
about American business and development,'' Young says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothers me _ it really does _ that the richest continent on
the face of the Earth, in terms of natural resources and raw
materials has the poorest people living on top of the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   In advising American corporations in Africa, Young sees
continuity, not a break from his past. ``My whole career one way or
another has been trying to find common ground between people who
are different.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet at times it seems there are two Andy Youngs: The one he
sees, and the one others see.
</P>
<P>
   Like a chameleon who can't see its ongoing transformations,
Young views his roles in business, politics and the church as one
in the same. He often seizes a preacher's moral high ground,
drawing no boundaries as he moves effortlessly from one role to the
next.
</P>
<P>
   It is the mark of the man and what has often put him at the
center of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Nike and the Olympics
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Young was hired by Nike Inc. to investigate
allegations of human rights violations in its factories in Asia,
including charges of physical abuse of workers and of teen-age
girls paid 20 cents an hour for their labor. Young toured plants in
Vietnam, Indonesia and China and says he found no sweatshop
conditions. His report, which suggested Nike could do better, was
harshly criticized by human rights groups. That criticism ``didn't
bother me in the least,'' Young says. ``I saw people with jobs ...
good jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can get so damned self-righteous trying to be purer than
thou that we miss the major moral issue,'' he says. ``The major
moral issue is that starvation on the planet Earth is a sin and a
shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business right now may be the hope of the planet.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Young's name has surfaced in connection with
the growing Olympics scandal, although no one has provided evidence
of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   He was central to Atlanta's winning bid to host the 1996 Games,
primarily responsible for wooing the votes from Africa. A month
before Atlanta won, Young took boxes of sports equipment to his
friend Jean-Claude Ganga, the International Olympic Committee
member from the Republic of Congo. Young has said that Ganga became
a last-minute convert to Atlanta's bid, withdrawing support of
Toronto's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Now with the Salt Lake City scandal raising questions about vote
buying, Young defends such gifts as ``humanitarian aid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You are expected to help people in need in the Olympic family,
particularly if you come from a rich country such as this,'' he
says. When the president of Mozambique told him his country's
runners lacked protein, Young says he made calls and got
Archer-Daniels-Midland to help donate 56 tons of free food to
Africa. Young says the shipment was made after Atlanta secured the
Olympics, but before the 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the Olympics as a tool for helping Africa get on its
feet,'' Young says. ``And I'm still trying to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   He denies an Australian Olympic official's recent charge that he
promised U.S. foreign aid to African IOC delegates in exchange for
their support of Atlanta's bid. As an outgoing mayor in 1990, he
wasn't in a position to give out U.S. funds. He also was busy
running for governor of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is the perception of him, Young says. In
other nations, he says, ``people still perceive me as being a part
of the United States government.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, now Young is a representative of the United States in
his role as chairman of the Southern Africa Enterprise Fund, which
dispenses U.S. foreign aid in Africa, though not until 1997 _ seven
years after Atlanta won the Games.
</P>
<P>
   It's another example of the blurred lines in his life.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Young sees it: ``I have a reputation around the world as
being something of an American government spokesman on issues. In
most countries, and particularly in Australia, people who are in
politics are always in politics. They represent a party and a party
position. We don't have that.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed as Young's career demonstrates, in the United States,
politicians often move into other areas and other roles.
</P>
<P>
   Politics, poverty and profits
</P>
<P>
   Recently Young sat in the corporate offices of GoodWorks
International on the 48th floor of the SunTrust Plaza. He was
nursing a cold he blamed on impure air circulating in planes.
``It's miserable,'' he said of his frequent flying. ``One of the
things I've been trying to get Delta to take up is there ought to
be some way to pump pure oxygen into the plane.''
</P>
<P>
   GoodWorks is an international consulting firm formed in 1996
with several partners, among them Hamilton Jordan, the former White
House chief of staff for President Jimmy Carter. It was Carter who
appointed Young as United Nations ambassador, a post from which
Young was pressured to resign in 1979 after his visit with the PLO.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as ever, Young makes no apologies for the course his life
has taken, describing the path from civil rights to politics to
corporate business as a logical progression that has its roots in
his life as a country preacher in South Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't preach to people that they were God's children in
a society that said (that) they were second-class citizens, that
they had to sit in the back of the bus or that they couldn't
vote,'' he says. ``One's Christian faith required that you be in
the public arena.''
</P>
<P>
   Those beliefs led him to the civil rights movement and his
association with King. The next step was public office. But Young
became mayor of Atlanta in 1982, the federal, state and local
governments couldn't afford the poverty programs he'd envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if you want to help God's children, and if you want to feed
the hungry, you've got to provide jobs. And that meant establishing
relationships with business.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my interest in being mayor, and my interest in creating
jobs, was never to make money.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he makes plenty of money today. In addition to his
corporate board memberships, and his GoodWorks salary, he earns an
undisclosed amount in speeches, but that's ``not anybody's
business.'' Since mid-January, he says he's made at least 10
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   The lion's share of his speeches, he says, are unpaid, and he
often returns speaking fees paid by church organizations. ``But
when there are people that I know will pay other folk big money, I
don't want to speak for nothing,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Caution: Criticism ahead?
</P>
<P>
   Young first traveled to Africa in the fall of 1973 as a
congressman accompanying George Shultz, then U.S. secretary of the
Treasury. When Young travels to Africa today, he goes sometimes as
private businessman, sometimes as government representative,
sometimes as democracy's advocate. He sees no distinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crisis in the world is that so many people are starving
and that the world is on the brink of chaos,'' Young says. ``My
interest now is to get more business involved in Africa. Because I
think that is not only the hope of Africa, but also the missing
link in the global economy is Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   But his association with Chevron illustrates the fine line Young
often walks.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco-based oil corporation has hired Young to be
its bridge-builder to the government of Angola. But farther north
in Nigeria, the corporation is embroiled in a human rights
investigation, stemming from its involvement last May in the
killing of protesters opposed to Chevron's dredging of rivers and
streams.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Environmental Rights Action, in Benin City,
Nigeria, say 121 young people were unarmed and peacefully
protesting the oil company's damage to rivers, streams and
wildlife, when Chevron-hired security forces swooped in on
helicopters and opened fire, killing two and wounding 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the same thing with literally all the oil companies,''
said Nnimmo Bassey, director of the environmental organization.
``They don't like discussion with the people. They prefer to use
troops. This is what is happening in the Niger Delta right now. So
many youths are being killed because they want discussions with oil
companies and with the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Bassey blames Chevron and other oil companies for keeping
Nigeria's military government in power. ``They're like two vampires
joined together in unholy wedlock,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Young says no one denies the tragedy occurred, but he disputes
the details. He says he doubts Chevron hired the troops that killed
the protesters, although he admits he has no supporting evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Nigeria was one of the best-run (Chevron) operations
that I'd seen,'' he says. ``The guy knew the issues, was sensitive
to the politics; they were doing a great job of training Nigerians.
You pick on the people who are most vulnerable. Chevron was
vulnerable and visible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened or how it happened, but the oil is
there, it's going to be there. The U.S. needs it, Nigeria needs it.
My consulting role is to try to work out an arrangement where
everybody benefits from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Oil-rich African countries, Young says, are critical to the
world economy. For example, Chevron is putting $10 billion into
Angola, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Chevron pulled out of Angola for any reason, Angola would
probably fall apart. Also, it wouldn't be long before we'd start
having long lines at the gas pump.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution in Nigeria, Young says, is a new government, not a
pullout by oil companies. For more than three years, he has refused
to visit Nigeria in opposition to its military government, while
lobbying for the release of his friend, Olusegun Obasanjo. The
pro-democracy general was released from prison last summer and now
is considered a strong contender in the Nigerian presidential
election, scheduled for Feb. 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we've been working towards,'' says Young, who
hopes to travel to Nigeria to celebrate his friend's inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   Young's role with Chevron doesn't mean Young is a ``bad guy,''
says Julian Bond, chairman of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, though it could be troubling.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Chevron is behaving badly (in Africa), then someone needs
to put a stop to it, and Andy Young is a person who could do
that,'' Bond says.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, if he serves as an apologist for Chevron,
then he is not being true to ideals he professed when he was with
Dr. King.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bond calls Young's path from civil rights to
Chevron a natural one. ``What he does now on one level isn't
radically different from what he did then,'' Bond says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where there are two groups of people who can (be put together)
for their mutual profit, he connects them. And sometimes it works
to his profit financially. And sometimes, it works to society's
benefit in a nonmaterial way.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hope Franklin, an eminent scholar of the African-American
experience, who chaired President Clinton's race relations
initiative, agrees that Young is a natural link between Africa and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regard him as a crossover person, working both sides,''
Franklin says. ``I think of him as a person blazing a trail and
working in new ways to provide various connecting points across the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   But Franklin says Young should be forthright about Chevron's
dealings in Africa. ``I do have some word that he, like other
Americans, might not be as critical of what's going on as they
should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, who rarely acts defensive, bristles at the remark.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many hungry people has he fed?'' Young says, calling
Franklin ``an old socialist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why, all of a sudden, are so damned many capitalists
self-righteous about other people making money when they make
money?''
</P>
<P>
   And, no, Young says, that is not the business side of him
speaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``What liberals forget is the extent to which they are
beneficiaries of corporations, in terms of their pension funds, in
terms of the cost of oil in their cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate now teaching at Emory
University's school of theology, remains grateful to Young for
drawing U.S. attention to the struggle against apartheid in South
Africa during the late-1970s, when Young was U.N. ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Tutu says, foreign companies are welcome in Africa's
developing countries, but they must be accountable to certain
standards. They can't, Tutu says, prop up corrupt regimes,
recklessly exploit the environment, violate human rights or pay
inadequate wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that from this distance,'' Tutu says, ``the
concern is, it appears that Chevron does not pass muster against
the criteria that I have delineated.''
</P>
<P>
   No dividing line needed
</P>
<P>
   Most of Young's time in Africa now is spent in his private work,
consulting not only for Chevron but several other American
companies he declines to name.
</P>
<P>
   Young estimates that 10 percent to 15 percent of his time in
Africa is devoted to the publicly funded Southern Africa Enterprise
Development Fund.
</P>
<P>
   But that's difficult to quantify, he adds, because he often
combines his private business for GoodWorks with his work for the
fund, as he recently did during a trip to Zimbabwe. Young
acknowledges this overlap, but says it doesn't benefit him
personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``GoodWorks doesn't take any money from governments,'' he says.
``We have no business connection with anybody that's receiving any
funds from the Fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, he adds, he is one of 18 members of a board that
includes, among others, Maurice Tempelsman, the diamond magnate,
and Carl Ware, president of Coca-Cola's Africa Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``By my choice, we have made every decision by consensus,''
Young says. ``One of the reasons why we have been so slow is they
have wanted to be sure about everything they did. So, we work out
the details until everybody is comfortable with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its creation, the Fund has provided loans and equity
investments to 12 projects in six countries. Five of the projects
are in South Africa. According to last year's annual report, in
five years, the Fund has invested only $9 million of the $100
million.
</P>
<P>
   However, in one project in Angola, the Fund is investing
$350,000 in a company whose major customer is Chevron Oil.
</P>
<P>
   But Young says the surest way for the Fund to make sound
business decisions is to tie its equity position and loans to solid
American companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, the guy from Chevron really does the bookkeeping for
this guy, is helping him set up the business,'' Young says.
``(Chevron) wants to help people. They want to try to find a way to
give Angolans jobs, and this is one way to give Angolans jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Young says he sees no need to draw a line between his public and
private roles. ``I could say, `Nobody who has anything to do with
Chevron can get anything from the Fund,' and make myself clean,''
he says. ``But who does that help? Not a soul.''
</P>
<P>
   He points out that Angola is one of the 11 countries the Fund is
supposed to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Marriott went into South Africa _ and I'm on the Marriott
board _ the first thing that I would do, through the Fund, would be
to get somebody black to own a part of that Marriott,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not helping me, and it's not helping Marriott. Marriott
is going to be there anyway. The only question is: Is anybody
underprivileged going to be empowered? And they aren't going to be
empowered unless I'm there, or somebody like me, is there.''
</P>
<P>
   Securing his retirement
</P>
<P>
   As he reflects on his career, Young reiterates that he was never
motivated by money.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls accepting an invitation to travel to Africa with
Carter in January 1986, after his re-election as Atlanta's mayor.
That trip overlapped with the MLK holiday and Black History Month _
a big speech-making time for him. Young says he gave up more than
$50,000 in speeches to go because he believed the trip held a
higher purpose.
</P>
<P>
   But money does matter now, he admits, to secure his own future.
``Because I've been in so many jobs, I didn't have a retirement _
from Congress, from the U.N., from the city. And so, by and large,
all of those board fees are, as much as possible, deferred income,
for a time when I won't be physically able to work.''
</P>
<P>
   He aspires to complete his corporate work in four more years, at
which point he'll be 70 and, he expects, slowing down physically.
He's put on a little weight, but wears it well with his pinstriped
suit and gold cuff links.
</P>
<P>
   One of his remaining goals is to donate $1 million to education,
health and religion. His four children are grown _ he's a
grandfather, too _ and his responsibility, as he sees it, is ``to
future generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, who still preaches occasionally at the First
Congregational Church, also wants to write another book. So full
and varied are his life's works that when Young published his
500-plus page autobiography in 1996, the book ended in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   But he doesn't plan to fill in his last 27 years in his next
book. Instead, he wants to write about his vision for the world's
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``People really get nervous,'' Young says. ``They think things
are falling apart. I think they are just beginning to come
together. And I can see how all of this could work out.''

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Medicinal treasures from the tropics
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For centuries, people in India have cleaned their
teeth with the twigs of the neem tree, a relative of mahogany. They
have smeared neem-leaf juice on skin disorders, drunk neem tea as a
tonic and placed neem leaves in their beds, cupboards and closets
to drive away bugs.
</P>
<P>
   To these people, neem has miraculous powers.
</P>
<P>
   Similar stories can be repeated for thousands of other plants
around the world used by native people to treat infections, pains,
fevers and other maladies. Scientists have begun paying serious
attention to this medicinal folklore, because from the plants may
come the next miracle drugs against cancer, heart disease,
parasitic infections and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Now, several University of Georgia researchers will become the
latest cadre of specialists scouring the tropics for therapeutic
plant species. Under a new $2.5 million, five-year federal grant,
the UGA scientists will focus on the homeland of the Highland Maya
people in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas. Five research
teams from other institutions are conducting searches in eight
other countries in Latin America, Africa and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The new research greatly expands previous efforts to find
medicinal plants. Although pharmaceutical firms have trekked for
decades through the tropics for plants with therapeutic value, the
forays picked up steam in the 1980s when the National Cancer
Institute contracted with the Missouri Botanical Garden in St.
Louis, the University of Illinois in Chicago and the New York
Botanical Garden to gather thousands of plant specimens in the rain
forests of South America, Asia and Africa. Extracts from the
leaves, stems, flowers, bark and other parts of the plants were
screened for anti-cancer properties.
</P>
<P>
   Out of about 14,000 plant specimens collected so far, extracts
from about 2 percent have been found to have anti-cancer potential,
and may be candidates for more rigorous testing and possible drug
development.
</P>
<P>
   But under a new federal program that began in 1992, the
international search for therapeutic plants _ a process called
``bioprospecting'' _ has been greatly widened to look for
treatments for other ills.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the program is designed so that the
development of powerful new drugs from natural products can provide
an economic return for native people in Third World countries.
That, in turn, will encourage the sustainable use of native plants
and other natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential rewards (from bioprospecting) should provide
benefits to the source country and local communities that are the
stewards of these resources,'' says Joshua Rosenthal of the
National Institutes of Health's Fogarty International Center.
Moreover, he notes, the sharing is a requirement under the 1992
United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, which has been
ratified by more than 170 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The program means that much of the rain forest land _ now being
lost at a rate of 50 million acres a year _ may not be cut for wood
products and agriculture; rare plants and animals won't lose their
habitats; and residents won't resort to environment-damaging
activities to escape crushing poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia team ``will discover, isolate and evaluate plants
that might have medicinal value and then use them to help develop
the local economy of the Highland Tzeltal and Tzotzil Maya through
sustainable production,'' says Brent Berlin, an anthropologist who
directs UGA's Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies.
</P>
<P>
   The plant search is sponsored by a consortium of agencies that
includes the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Agency for
International Development and the National Institutes of Health and
its Fogarty International Center. The six research teams, including
UGA's, are known as International Cooperative Biodiversity Groups.
The UGA group includes eight senior researchers and several
graduate students in biochemistry, anthropology and molecular
biology.
</P>
<P>
   In large part, the program was developed out of concern that
over the decades, some drug companies committed what Berlin says
was the equivalent of plunder by taking plants from a country,
developing them into medicines with high commercial value, and
leaving almost nothing behind for the host country that supplied
the natural product. Similarly, the National Science Foundation
says that one pitfall of bioprospecting is the danger of falling
into a new form of colonialism _ extracting and exporting raw
materials from developing countries without increasing the capacity
of the countries to develop and export their own products.
</P>
<P>
   This time, native people and host countries will participate in
the projects and command a large share of any economic benefits
from the medicinal plants.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Butler, an intellectual property rights lawyer at UGA,
has been working closely with Berlin, his colleagues and Mexican
officials to develop agreements that will provide adequate legal
protection for Maya participants in the project.
</P>
<P>
   A systematic search for plants that may hold cures for diseases
is a daunting task. There are more than 220,000 flowering plant
species in the world, but only about 2 percent to 5 percent have
been tested for possible effectiveness against diseases, even
though indigenous peoples have used the plants for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Driving the scientists in their search is the knowledge that
nearly 80 percent of the 150 most commonly prescribed drugs are
derived from plants and other organisms. The heart drug digitalis,
for instance, was derived from foxglove. Aspirin came from the
white willow tree and penicillin from a fungus.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, scientists at Eli Lilly and Co., while
searching for an anti-diabetes drug in plants, found instead two
powerful anti-cancer drugs, vincristine and vinblastine, in the
rosy periwinkle.
</P>
<P>
   The tropics are the focus of most of the plant surveys because
climate, varied terrain and rainfall make tropical rain forests a
vast botanical garden of biological diversity. However, the rapid
loss of these places to logging, agriculture and other purposes has
prompted a new urgency in the search for therapeutic plants.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin and his wife, anthropologist Elois Ann Berlin, who is a
co-leader in the plant inventory portion of the project, have been
collecting information for the past 11 years on how the Highland
Maya use various native plants to treat a wide range of illnesses.
The Maya's homeland is the world's third richest in numbers of
vascular plant species because of the diverse habitats and terrain
found in the region, from mountains to deep valleys.
</P>
<P>
   The Berlins and other members of the UGA group, working with
native people and local scientists, will focus initially on nearly
900 commonly known species in the Highland Maya's homeland. Many of
these species have been used for centuries by Maya people in
medicinal preparations to treat ailments ranging from infections to
stomach maladies. But the chemical properties of these medicines
remain largely unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to determine what the key ingredients are and what
parts of the plants are medically necessary,'' Elois Ann Berlin
explains. ``We now have a good idea of the most important species
that are used in traditional curing by the Highland Maya; we just
don't yet know how they work.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, thousands of other plants will be scrutinized. The
work could start as early as March if Mexican collecting permits
and agreements on intellectual property rights can be finalized by
then. The Georgia researchers will collaborate with scientists from
Mexico's El Colegio de la Frontera Sur.
</P>
<P>
   Specimens of the same species may be collected from several
spots because the soil, water, terrain or other factors at certain
locations may influence the chemical makeup of plants. Also, the
time of the collection will be carefully noted because the
biochemistry of plants may differ between night and day.
</P>
<P>
   Extracts from the plants will be screened at UGA and other
institutions for indications of an effect against more than a dozen
maladies. Extracts that show promise will undergo additional
testing, and more specimens of those plants may be collected.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia researchers also will work closely with the private
company Xenova Discovery Ltd. of Berkshire, England, which will
screen the extracts for novel drugs that could be patented.
</P>
<P>
   If an extract shows promise against certain diseases but cannot
be patented, the plant's pharmacological properties and potential
use in the growing international herb market will be documented.
``This could provide a major economic growth model for Chiapas and
other areas,'' Elois Ann Berlin says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ... want to actively promote beneficial plant species in
home gardens and community medicinal plants projects, since this
knowledge is seriously threatened due to rapid cultural change,''
she adds.

 &HT;    Now it's Atlanta's turn to reap Super harvest
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The corporate hospitality tents have vanished, the
stretch limos have been scrubbed, vacuumed and returned to service
carrying starry-eyed newlyweds, and Pro Player Stadium has been
swept clean of every last shred of Roman-numeral-stamped Super Bowl
debris.
</P>
<P>
   Now the torch of America's annual orgy of sports hype and hoopla
heads to Atlanta, host of Super Bowl XXXIV on Jan. 30, 2000. Miami
is left with pleasant memories, a few lingering hangovers and
hordes of exhausted hospitality workers.
</P>
<P>
   And truckloads of cash _ at least to hear boosters tell it.
</P>
<P>
   Although the receipts aren't yet tallied, the National Football
League estimates this year's game generated a whopping $300 million
in economic impact for South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't count the value of a solid week of priceless,
soft-focus media attention showcasing beaches, bikinis and
flower-shirted revelers, along with the opportunity for local
promoters to cozy up with thousands of corporate top guns jetted in
as guests for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell has already predicted next year's
game will generate $250 million for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the premier event for any destination in this
country,'' said Nicki Grossman, president of the Greater Fort
Lauderdale Convention and Visitors Bureau, co-host of Super Bowl
XXXIII. ``The revenues generated are remarkable for a one-time
event, and more important is the boost your image gets. We can buy
all the ads we want, but we'll never be able to target the 150,000
high-rollers and corporate decision-makers you get at a Super
Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all economists are buying into the Super Bowl financial
hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really drastically inflated,'' said University of South
Florida economist Philip Porter, who has analyzed taxable sales
revenues from several past Super Bowls. ``All they're doing is
displacing other visitors who would've been there anyway, and to
get the values they're claiming, you'd have to double the amount of
economic activity. They're really blowing smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Not true, other economists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all due respect to Dr. Porter, there are a number of
factors he didn't consider,'' said Robert Canton, director of the
Sports Convention and Entertainment Group for the accounting firm
PricewaterhouseCoopers, which was hired by the NFL to study the
1998 Super Bowl's impact on host city San Diego. ``We took an
independent, objective approach and did an extraordinary amount of
primary research. This is our specialty, and what we found is that
the Super Bowl is the crown jewel of events. In San Diego, it was
worth from $218 to $295 million, depending on the economic
multipliers you use.''
</P>
<P>
   Those multipliers are part of the problem for Porter. While
direct Super Bowl spending _ hotel rooms, rental cars, restaurant
meals, bar tabs, souvenirs _ can be measured with reasonable
accuracy, he believes the NFL and host cities vastly inflate the
value of indirect spending, which happens when those directly spent
dollars get cycled through the local economy. For instance, a
caterer buying food, paying workers or hiring extra workers to
handle a Super Bowl event creates economic ripples that economists
estimate amount to an additional $1 to $2 for each dollar spent.
</P>
<P>
   But Canton and others defend the estimates, and also cite hard
figures to back them up.
</P>
<P>
   ``In San Diego, hotels had a spike of 126,000-room nights over
the previous January, and most were receiving higher rates than
they get in a normal January,'' Canton said. ``San Diego's Gas Lamp
tourist district reported a 100 percent increase in business for
the week of the Super Bowl, with some businesses showing gains as
high as 200 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   But Atlanta doesn't have to leave this Super question to warring
accountants and academics. The city hosted its own Super Bowl in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   A University of Georgia study estimated the game generated $166
million in economic impact, with $76 million in direct spending and
$90 million in indirect activity, according to Jeff Humphreys,
director of the school's economic forecasting unit.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Humphreys says, he may have low-balled the
multiplier effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's too much controversy over these
impacts,'' he said. ``You can't just use multipliers pulled out of
the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Porter, however, says taxable sales in counties which hosted
five Florida Super Bowls actually show a decline in most of the
years studied.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are government figures anybody can look up,'' he said.
``I'm not making assumptions or multiplying anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But his critics point out that he made no effort to break out
Super Bowl spending from the host county's overall economic
activity. For Miami in 1995, for example, Porter compared the total
taxable sales, which amounted to $1.76 billion that year, to the
average for 1993 and 1994, which was $1.765 billion. The Super
Bowl's comparatively small contribution to the total is too easily
lost in the sea of other economic activity which might vary
significantly from year to year, they insist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many other variables, and the Super Bowl is a
relatively small ... percentage,'' Humphreys said.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis by Fort Lauderdale's Sun-Sentinel newspaper of the
1995 Super Bowl in South Florida narrowed things down by looking at
taxable sales for the 15 sectors of the economy most likely to be
affected by the game: restaurants, hotels, transportation and
merchandise, among others. The newspaper found a $130 million spike
compared to the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a 6 percent jump in hotel occupancy that year,''
Grossman said. ``And even though January is our high season, the
1995 Super Bowl was the first year we ever approached 100 percent
occupancy in January.''
</P>
<P>
   Another rap on the Super Bowl is that it costs too much for host
cities to put on because the NFL pressures them for concessions,
freebies and upfront cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cities are dealing with the NFL, which is in essence a
monopolist,'' said University of Chicago economist Allen Sanderson,
another skeptic about the game's impact. ``It's not a level playing
field. The NFL has enormous leverage in getting cities to bid
against each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourism promoters, however, say they routinely grant concessions
and up-front cash to attract other events. And the Super Bowl,
while perhaps costing more, also generates more, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year we're hosting the Women's International Bowling
League with 60,000 attendees, and we put up more than half of the
$480,000 we put up to help get this year's Super Bowl,'' Grossman
said. ``But the Super Bowl brought 140,000 people _ and most of
them high-rollers.''
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, South Florida governments contributed $1.2 million
in public money to host this year's game, with an estimated $3.8
million coming from private sources.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta in 1994, the city, the state and Fulton County each
ponied up $300,000 to help stage the game, while other perks and
freebies, from free hotel rooms to waivers on sales tax on tickets
to free parking and free use of the Georgia Dome, kicked the total
package to around $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   For next year's game, the host committee estimates it will need
about $7.5 million, of which $2 million will come from the
hospitality industry, $2 million from the business community and
$3.5 million from local and state governments, according to Atlanta
Convention and Visitors Bureau President Spurgeon Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a darned good investment,'' he said. ``For $7 million,
you're getting $250 million back. We're in the business of filling
hotel rooms, and if we could get the Super Bowl every year, we'd go
for it. You can't buy this kind of attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonbelievers are particularly skeptical of the free-media
argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``That baffles me,'' Porter said. ``When a destination buys an
ad, they control the copy and the image. Here they are inviting
3,000 critical journalists over whom they have no control. There
are going to be critical stories, negative stories. How many
stories about this year's game mentioned dead German tourists and
the 1989 riots during Super Bowl week in Miami?'' But tourism
professionals say the academics can theorize all they want. Their
own real-world experience, they say, backs up the NFL's claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do this from an academic perspective,'' Grossman
said. ``These professors aren't here seeing what we see. There is
no question that Super Bowl visitors spend a lot more than our
normal visitors, and that they bring us more business. It's not Joe
Lunchbucket coming here for the game, it's the president of the
Lunchbucket Corp. That's what our money is buying.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanderson concedes that the Super Bowl brings economic benefits
to a host city, although he believes it often is vastly overstated.
Both he and Porter think the far greater error many cities make in
dealing with the NFL is to put up hundreds of millions of dollars
in public money to build stadiums to attract or keep teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes cities prosper is not hosting Super Bowls, it's
boring, day-to-day stuff like filling potholes, building new parks
and improving schools,'' Sanderson said. ``These things aren't as
sexy or attractive as a Super Bowl, but I think they are a far more
appropriate way for a city to spend its money.''

lawmakers put finishing touches on the massive act, intended to
give consumers more choices and drive prices downward. That hasn't
happened: Today, not a single Baby Bell has been given the green
light to move into long-distance markets. Consumers haven't
benefitted either. Telephone prices have kept pace with inflation,
but they haven't been reduced as promised. And cable rates have
soared at an estimated 7 percent per year. What's more, the telecom
landscape has shifted dramatically. Telephone, cable and wireless
companies are in a frenzy to position themselves for the great
Internet race. The dizzying speed of developments has left
lawmakers and regulators grappling with how to regulate an industry
that is changing more quickly than rules can be written. (Regan,

   ANDY-YOUNG _At 66, Andrew Young, among Atlanta's most defining
figures of the past half century, has morphed one more time: He's
Corporate Andy now, flying a million miles last year, pulling down
$25,000 for some speeches and earning more than $200,000 annually
for serving on corporate boards (Marriott, Delta, Archer-Daniels
Midland). He spends much of his time in Africa now, quietly
consulting for select American corproations such as Chevron. He's
living out a seeming contradiction: the pastor/human rights
activist representing an oil company charged with killing peaceful
protesters. But he, as ever, sees his life as fluid, and seizes the
moral highground. (Pomerantz/Hansen, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   SUPERBOWL-IMPACT _ ATLANTA _ As Atlanta prepares to host ithe
2000 Super Bowl, there's some substantial disagreement about how

who say that it's the king of special events, and that its benefits
can be long lasting. (Williams, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED

   GIST _ Virginia planter Samuel Gist wrote a utopian provision
into his will in 1808. He directed that his 300 slaves be freed
upon his death and his plantation turned into a sort of freedman
commune. But his last wishes collided with Commonwealth law, which
required that freed slaves leave the state. After much legal
wrangling following Gist's 1815 death, Virginia courts created an
alternate plan. They set up three ``settlements'' for the Gist
slaves in Ohio. Today, only one Gist settlement remains, in
Highland County _ and it's a legal quagmire. Several families of
descendants of the Gist slaves still live on the land, but none of
them has been able to acquire any of the land. For many years, it
was uncertain who was responsible for ever-escalating back taxes.
To prevent the settlement from being sold at sheriff's sale, slave
descendant Paul Turner, who has been farming much of the land for
25 years, agreed to pay taxes on land he doesn't own. Now, Turner
is trying to get title to his land, as is Charles Peacock, who owns
a junkyard on settlement land and who filed a civil lawsuit against
the county in 1996. ``There wouldn't have been a Gist settlement if
I hadn't come back here and paid the taxes,'' Turner said. ``I'd
like to keep it the Gist settlement because I know what the people
went through who came here.'' (Beyerlein, Dayton daily News) MOVED

   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Sitting in a student cafeteria overlooking
the Bosporus, Ragip Duran said the food in prison was better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did our own cooking, and our rules were to eat a lot of
vegetables, very little fried food, and nothing fattening like rice
or macaroni,'' said Duran, who was released from the Saray prison
outside Istanbul last week after serving 7{ months. ``You have to
watch your weight in jail, because there isn't much to do and you
have the tendency to eat all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Duran, a journalist, is among dozens of Turkish intellectuals
who have become familiar with prison routines. Laws against
terrorism here outlaw statements that are judged to support
violence or separatism, and special ``state security courts''
regularly sentence politicians and writers for violating them.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign governments and human rights groups have condemned those
tribunals. The European Human Rights Court, an arm of the European
Union, has concluded that they ``are not impartial and are not
independent tribunals.'' But many politicians and military officers
say they are a vital part of the country's effort to defend itself
against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Duran has been writing about the Kurdish minority in Turkey for
more than 20 years, and it was an article about the Kurdish
guerrilla leader, Abdullah Ocalan, that resulted in his conviction.
He suggested that Ocalan, whom the Turkish authorities blame for
tens of thousands of deaths, could emerge as a Turkish version of
the Italian unifier Giuseppe Garibaldi. That statement was judged
to be an incitement to separatist terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have made a great investment in the Kurdish issue, and in
the next few months I'll be going back to the southeast to see
what's going on,'' he said. ``I'll try to be more cautious than
before, but I have to write what I see. Otherwise it means I
surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government doesn't want anyone to speak about the Kurdish
problem, but it's a very important problem, not only for the Kurds
but for all the 60 million people of Turkey. Independent journalism
can make a contribution to peace. Well-informed people are much
more open to a peaceful solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Duran made good use of his prison time. He read more than 100
books, wrote two and translated one from French into Turkish. He
also contributed dozens of columns and book reviews to various
newspapers and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   In his cell, which was built for 14 people but during his stay
never held more than 12, the inmates devoted one evening each week
to discussion groups at which they reported on the books they had
just read. All of his cellmates were convicted of political
offenses, either advocating separatism or joining subversive
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we had the highest books-per-square-meter density of
any place in Turkey,'' he said. ``The conditions were quite good,
probably better than most jails in America. There's a big
difference between jails in this part of Turkey and the ones out in
the Kurdish area.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates, in Turkey and abroad, regularly
criticize conditions in Turkish detention centers and assert that
jailers often apply torture. Most of the alleged cases of torture,
though, are said to have occurred in police stations during the
first days of detention, when officers often seek to extract
confessions. There are fewer charges of abuse in prisons to which
people are sent after being convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Duran has returned to his post at Galatasaray University in
Istanbul, where he teaches journalism. He appears to be in good
health and spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was angry in jail, because I didn't think I had committed
any crime,'' he said. ``It is impossible to commit a crime by
speaking or writing. No speech or article or book has ever killed
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My concept of law is that although I'm against these
anti-terrorism laws, I have to respect not their content but their
consequences,'' he said. ``That's why I went to jail instead of
leaving the country. I know I have to fight with legal and
legitimate means against laws which violate the spirit and essence
of democracy. If that means I have to go to jail, I go.''

   GUMMERSBACH, Germany _ To read the local court's verdict last
October, Werner Hund was more than just guilty. He was a ``danger
to the public interest,'' an incorrigible repeat offender who had
to be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Hund, 40, is a self-employed roofer. His alleged crime: taking
telephone calls at home from customers.
</P>
<P>
   Talking on the phone is not usually illegal. But Hund was
licensed to work only as a ``traveling'' carpenter, not as a
``master'' roofer. It was all right for him to walk up to a
construction site and offer his services, but he was forbidden to
have a fixed place of business.
</P>
<P>
   Now, eight years after Hund says he did not hang out his
shingle, the local authorities are about to shut him down. ``They
keep talking about the unemployment problem, but they're putting me
out of work,'' he grumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Hund is one of countless Germans caught up in a much broader
political battle over job protection and workplace flexibility.
Germany has some of the strictest work rules in Europe, which have
helped produce one of the best-paid and most productive work forces
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But Germany also has high labor costs and a stubbornly high
unemployment rate of more than 10 percent. And competition is
increasing as Europe becomes a single market with a single
currency. In Spain, tens of thousands of people work in illegal
sweatshops that operate with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   The work rules cover more than 90 professions, and few areas are
as tightly regulated as the country's skilled crafts. Those include
everything from carpentry, baking and piano repair to window
washing, house painting and boat building.
</P>
<P>
   Most other developed countries, including the United States, set
licensing standards for many professions. But in Germany the
entrance barriers are higher, the rules more complex and the
punishments harsher.
</P>
<P>
   House painters, for instance, need to attend classes for several
years, serve as apprentices and then pass a rigorous exam before
receiving a coveted ``meisterbrief.'' The classes and testing alone
often cost more than $5,000, not counting the living expenses that
a worker has while not earning money.
</P>
<P>
   Though workers do not require full certification to work under
the supervision of a meister, the vast majority of craft workers
are either self-employed or work in small companies that do little
outside hiring.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of Simone, 34, a roofer in the town of Hagen.
After working illegally for three years, she was caught by city
officials last November and given a staggering fine of 80,000
marks, or about $47,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a profession dominated by males, and I don't have any
other job possibilities,'' said Simone, who did not want to
disclose her full name in public because she is still looking for
work on the sly. ``The only way I could get certified would be to
live in another city for at least seven months while I attended
roofing classes. I can't leave my family for seven months.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the system argue that it protects the public from
shoddy work and helps finance education programs. Besides setting
rigorous educational standards, master craft workers all pay dues
to national associations that run technical training centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a time when quality is ever more important,'' said
Hanns-Eberhard Schleyer, secretary-general of the Association of
German Handworkers in Bonn. ``The strength of Germany is largely
due to the strength of its middle-sized industry and to its skilled
workers.''
</P>
<P>
   But others argue that the organized craft workers are simply
shielding themselves from competition. ``The main purpose of all
this is to protect themselves,'' said Horst Mirbach, the author of
a book on laws governing craft workers and founder of an advocacy
group in Bonn called Action for Trade Freedom.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The German government liberalized the law somewhat last year,
making it easier for people to move between different crafts and
lowering the requirements for certain lines of work.
</P>
<P>
   But even today the rules are strict _ and tricky. Marion Beuter
is an authorized piano tuner near Heidelberg. But she lives in
daily fear of being caught repairing pianos, which she is not
certified to do.
</P>
<P>
   A potentially major battle is brewing over companies that repair
personal computers but most of which never bothered to seek
accreditation, because the entire field was so new.
</P>
<P>
   There have already been a few scuffles between traditional
office-machine services and the newer computer consulting and
repair companies. So far the big craft organizations have generally
refrained from filing complaints, but they may not for long. ``It
is still very controversial,'' acknowledged Schleyer, of the
handworkers' organization.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the battles are being fought by people like Thomas
Melles, an unemployed carpenter who runs a tiny advocacy group in
the town of Woltersdorf called the Professional Association of
Independent Craft Workers. The group's logo features a ghost
carrying tools, a whimsical reference to spooking the
establishment. (The German acronym for the group is BUH, pronounced
boo.)
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us have gotten into trouble because we weren't paying
taxes or because of complaints about the quality of our work,''
said Melles, who was ordered to stop work last fall and faces a
fine of 5,000 marks, or about $3,000, each time he is caught.
</P>
<P>
   Like Hund, Melles thought he had found a loophole in the rules
by registering as a ``traveling'' tradesman. The idea dates back to
the times when knife-sharpeners and handymen would ply their
services door to door. A traveling tradesman can perform many jobs
without being a master, but is not allowed to advertise or even
keep an office.
</P>
<P>
   But the distinctions have now reached hair-splitting exactitude.
After lengthy deliberations, the local guild in Gummersbach allowed
Hund to paint a colorful sign on his truck but prohibited him from
putting a telephone number on it.
</P>
<P>
   Hund obeyed _ sort of. He put a phone number on the back of his
truck, underneath another sign promoting his work as a fully
authorized scaffold-builder.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to witnesses and deliberating about the truck, a
local court ruled last October that Hund should lose his license as
a traveling roofer. ``Unless the license is revoked, the public
interest will be jeopardized,'' the court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   A final decision on the license is due within the next few
weeks. In the meantime, Hund is grabbing as much work as he can
get.

A U.S. MEETING WITH INDONESIA ON ITS ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ A senior American diplomat visiting here on
Friday expressed U.S. support for the coming elections and warned
of deteriorating security in the troubled province of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Roth, assistant secretary of state for East Asia and
Pacific affairs, said many issues remain unresolved, including how
new election laws will be carried out and how to ensure that the
campaign before the June 7 vote remains free of violence.
</P>
<P>
   After meetings with President B.J. Habibie, government ministers
and opposition leaders, he said at a news conference: ``This is not
an ordinary election the people have been used to in Indonesia.
This is one in which there will be a vigorous campaign, many
candidates, many parties and most important _ the outcome uncertain
before the election.''
</P>
<P>
   On East Timor, Roth said current proposals to end the crisis in
the former Portuguese colony gave him a feeling of optimism that a
political settlement was possible. Indonesia invaded East Timor
after Portugal left and annexed it in 1976, but has never received
international recognition for its authority there.
</P>
<P>
   Roth said, however, ``My government is very concerned about the
increase in violence on the ground, the deterioration in the
situation on East Timor itself.'' He said he had discussed East
Timor security issues in ``great detail'' in talks with the chief
of the Indonesian armed forces, Gen. Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
   Wiranto told Roth that he supported a proposal by the jailed
East Timorese resistance leader, Xanana Gusmao, that all parties be
disarmed and that a cease-fire and an end to the violence be
declared.
</P>
<P>
   Gusmao, currently serving a 20-year term in a Jakarta maximum
security prison for inciting rebellion, will be released into a
form of house arrest this week, as part of a package of measures
proposed by Indonesia to break the deadlock in the current
negotiations.

   TBILISI, Georgia _ When they lost light and heat four years ago,
most Georgians could only shiver in the dark. On the way to the
bread lines, they trod carefully to avoid the corpses of those who
had perished scavenging overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Now Marina Kokobadze knows instantly what to do when the power
fails. Pulling a plug from one socket, she presses it into another
_ the socket linked to the ``second electric line'' that a corrupt
meter man installed for $30, plus $10 a month in ``fees.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as simple as that,'' said Ms. Kokobadze, 40, sipping tea
near the cherished line leading from her window to an unseen power
source beyond. A common part of the landscape here and in other
suffering parts of the former Communist world, such lines are
slender consolation in a nation once known as the most carefree in
the former Soviet Union, and now among the most miserable.
</P>
<P>
   They attest to the vast corruption that underlies Georgia's
deprivation, choking the nation and deflating trust in its leader,
President Eduard A. Shevardnadze, a man respected abroad for his
role in ending the Cold War as Soviet foreign minister, but widely
criticized at home by both local residents and resident diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1994, some $400 million in unpaid bills for natural
gas and electricity imports finally provoked suppliers like the
government of Turkmenistan to sever the flow of energy Georgia,
creating its most dreadful winter in memory.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's 5.5 million people gradually have learned to cope _
even if in most cases that means a 19th-century existence of
kerosene-fueled space heaters and wood stoves as sources of warmth,
hot water and light. That has generated black humor. In a common
outburst, people in Tbilisi wish for the death of an unspoken
neighbor because, as a goodwill gesture, the government provides
days of uninterrupted electricity to entire blocks when a funeral
is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Only the lucky, like Ms. Kokobadze, can afford the bribe for the
second line _ which is acquired by asking openly at the state power
office. Even her ``fee'' provides only enough power for one lamp
and the television; the ``elite'' option of power 24 hours a day
costs an initial $250, and higher monthly charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot live this way for long,'' said Ms. Kokobadze's
husband, Gia Gogoladze, 44, a builder in Tbilisi. ``Every day,
every year, it is worse and worse, backward and backward, my work
less and less.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Shevardnadze, 71, might argue that this is progress. Under
his leadership, Georgia has recovered from the low of 1993, when
civil war in a breakaway region, Abkhazia, threatened to engulf all
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Shevardnadze, a KGB boss in Georgia in the
Soviet era, outmaneuvered and arrested armed gangs that made much
of the nation lawless.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with the help of the International Monetary Fund, he
launched a national currency that despite a devaluation caused by
Russia's economic chaos is still among the region's most stable.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the work force is idle. Some teachers and policemen
have not been paid in months.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Georgia's IMF program was suspended, largely
because it has failed to improve one of the world's worst tax
collection rates.
</P>
<P>
   Shevardnadze conceded then that corruption has cost the state
``hundreds of millions of dollars.'' Diplomats say it is rampant,
from senior state officials who profit from cigarette, fuel and
alcohol smuggling to taxmen who buy their profitable jobs for
$5,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Soviet times, corruption in Georgia was legendary. Now,
said a Western lawyer who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
Shevardnadze and his compatriots must decide ``whether they want to
be a criminal state or a law-abiding country.''
</P>
<P>
   The electricity shortage exemplifies Georgia's crisis. Diplomats
say at least $15 million of the $82 million in foreign aid granted
since 1994 to fix the power problem has disappeared. Electrical
service has meanwhile worsened, and sabotage _ like repeated
mystery fires at Tbilisi's main generator _ is suspected.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the government sold Tbilisi's electric transmission
system to AES Corp., an Arlington, Va., company. In an interview,
Michael Scholey, AES' director in Georgia, said the company soon
would provide reliable, continuous power to Tbilisi.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, people like Ms. Kokobadze and Gogoladze suffice with
their auxiliary lines, and are grateful they do not live in the
countryside, where, Gogoladze noted ``children don't even know what
this thing called electricity is. When the sun sets, it's just time
to sleep.''

   HOUSTON _ It may look like a computer disk, but in the eyes of a
federal judge in Texas it behaves too much like a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling last month thought to be the first of its type in
the country, Judge Barefoot Sanders of U.S. District Court in
Dallas found that Parsons Technology Inc., which publishes Quicken
Family Lawyer and Quicken Family Lawyer '99, goes too far in the
assistance it provides consumers, resulting in an unauthorized
practice of law in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee, which sued
Parsons, says it will seek to ban the sale of the software in
Texas, raising First Amendment concerns. In addition, the case is
highlighting arguments about whether the committee is protecting
the public from shoddy legal practices or further alienating
consumers already priced out of the market for lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The Quicken software provides more than 100 different legal
forms, instructions on how to fill them out and assistance in
tailoring the documents to the user's situation.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons, based in Berkeley, Calif., and a unit of Broderbund
Software, argued that it had not engaged in the unauthorized
practice of law because there had to be some form of contact
between publisher and consumer for that to happen. Parsons also
said that interfering with the sale of its software would be a
violation of the First Amendment right of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanders found that ``Parsons, through Q.F.L., has gone
beyond publishing a sample form book with instructions, and has
ventured into the unauthorized practice of law.'' He also found
that although there was some restriction on free speech, it was in
keeping with the state's interest in protecting ``the uninformed
and unwary from overly simplistic legal advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Ticer, a lawyer for the committee, said he would move to
have the company banned from selling Quicken legal software in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Jordan, who represented Parsons, said he would offer
more information and ask the judge to reconsider his position once
the injunction was requested. If that failed, he said, he would
seek to delay sales limits during appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Software publishers said Texas was alone in its aggressive
scrutiny of legal self-help material. But the case is being watched
closely. Some software dealers say they steer clear of the state.
</P>
<P>
   The case has also focused attention on whether the Unauthorized
Practice of Law Committee is serving the people's interests.The
panel, responsible for enforcing the practice-of-law statute, is
made up of six lawyers and three nonlawyers, appointed by the
Supreme Court of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people who buy this program cannot afford to go to
a lawyer,'' said Jane Winn, an associate professor specializing in
the law of electronic commerce at Southern Methodist University in
Dallas. ``If you take this program away from the people who are
using it today, what access do they have to information about their
rights?''
</P>
<P>
   Walt Borges, director of Court Watch, a project in Austin that
monitors the courts, criticized the committee for promoting a
``monopoly of law'' and for operating in secret. ``Before anybody
bans a self-help product they need to be darn sure that this will
harm the public,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's secretive operations are already being
challenged in the Texas Supreme Court by Nolo Press, which
publishes a number of self-help legal manuals.
</P>
<P>
   Ticer defended the committee's right to operate with
confidentiality, explaining that the members do their own
investigations and could be hampered if their identities were
known.
</P>
<P>
   He also countered accusations that the committee was simply
trying to protect lawyers' interests in the state. ``We don't have
an agenda,'' Ticer said. ``We just carry out the statute.''

BASEBALL NOTES AND NEWS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   He surpassed the old major league home run record, led his team
to the playoffs and was named the league's most valuable player. As
great as those achievements were, and as gratifying as they were to
attain, they all might have placed behind one other feat Sammy Sosa
performed. He drove in one more run than Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are so competitive,'' Omar Minaya said. ``There was
a competitiveness between them from the start, a friendly
competitiveness. I think it still holds today.''
</P>
<P>
   Minaya, the Mets' senior assistant general manager, was there at
the start, in the Gulf Coast rookie league in 1986. He was the
coach and later the manager of the Texas Rangers' team in that
league, the one on which Sosa and Gonzalez began their professional
careers.
</P>
<P>
   The heroes of two Latin American countries, Sosa from the
Dominican Republic and Gonzalez from Puerto Rico, will be together
again Sunday night when they receive their MVP awards at the annual
dinner of the New York chapter of the Baseball Writers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime during the evening, Sosa undoubtedly will remind his
good friend of their RBI numbers, 158 and 157, good enough to lead
their respective leagues and lead their teams into the playoffs.
But there was that difference of one. The only other time Sosa
drove in more runs, Gonzalez missed nearly half of the season with
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Minaya, then a scout, signed Sosa for the Rangers in July 1985,
giving him a $3,500 bonus. The Rangers signed Gonzalez the
following May, for a $75,000 bonus, and both players reported to
the Gulf Coast League in June. ``The outfielders caught with each
other,'' Minaya said, recalling their first workout, ``and the
first time they played catch they played catch together.'' Their
throwing to each other was somewhat symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell right away there was a competitiveness between
them,'' Minaya related. ``They both had good arms and kids like to
show off their arms. There was a friendship, yet a competitiveness
between them.''
</P>
<P>
   Both players, Minaya said, were very intelligent, but beyond
intelligence and talent, they were different.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a difference in their personalities,'' Minaya said.
``Juan always has been happy. Some people may say he was a little
careless in the way he played the game, the way he worked out.
Sammy has always had that smile, but he had a blue-collar work
ethic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan would take the lows much better than Sammy. When things
didn't go well, you could see from Sammy's face how he was taking
it. He was under a lot of stress because he knew he was the only
way out for his family.''
</P>
<P>
   The youngsters _ Sosa was 17, Gonzalez was 16 _ lived together
in a complex in Sarasota, Fla. Gonzalez liked to listen to music
and hang out with other players. Sosa was still a kid at heart and
liked talking to children five and seven years his junior. Neither
minor league rookie could hit a curveball.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were definitely strikeout guys,'' Minaya said. ``They
were raw. Juan didn't hit any home runs. He was a real lean, skinny
kid, about 6-2, 6-3, lanky and loose. He was much leaner than
Sammy. Sammy had that raw strength. He would hit balls far. But I
thought Juan would be more of a home run hitter. He was much more
under control. Sammy played out of control like Clemente.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa hit four home runs that first year. He led the league in
doubles and total bases. Gonzalez led in times at bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just saw two raw kids who fit the mold of what we were
trying to do with the Rangers,'' Minaya said, ``getting young
talented players with an upside, kids who could be star players.''
</P>
<P>
   Both would develop into star players, though Sosa did it with
other teams. He and Gonzalez continued playing together in 1987 at
Gastonia (Class A) and in 1988 at Charlotte (A). They began the
1989 season at Tulsa (AA), but in July Sosa was traded to the
Chicago White Sox in a five-player deal that sent Harold Baines to
Texas. The White Sox traded Sosa to the Cubs in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Although they drifted apart, first on different teams, then in
different leagues, Sosa and Gonzalez remained friends and
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep down inside,'' Minaya said, ``they're saying, `How can I
top you next?' Juan got a big contract first, then Sammy got his
contract. I think both keep each other striving for more. They are
aware of each other's accomplishments.''
</P>
<P>
   Their accomplishments, since that beginning in the Gulf Coast
League, have been considerable.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Reds a Contender
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what are the Cincinnati Reds up to? Does Jim Bowden,
their general manager, have thoughts of trying to steal the
National League Central championship?
</P>
<P>
   No, Bowden said the day after the Reds acquired Greg Vaughn and
his 50-home run bat. That would be an exaggeration. But the NL wild
card? That's another matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly we're not the favorites for that,'' Bowden said.
``But if everything goes right, we have to be in the mix.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds have been engaged in a steady pattern of payroll
reduction, slashing a payroll a shade under $37 million in 1997 to
one just under $21 million last year. Even though they planned to
give out more dollars on their paydays this year, they weren't
viewed as a team in contention for anything.
</P>
<P>
   But then they traded Bret Boone, their second baseman, for Denny
Neagle, a costly pitcher, and just last week, even more
surprisingly, sent Reggie Sanders to San Diego for the
higher-priced Vaughn, a potential free agent.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds' lineup will still feature a collection of young
players, such as Sean Casey, Pokey Reese, Aaron Boone, Brett Tomko,
Dmitri Young and Mike Cameron. They will still ``stick with our
payroll constraints,'' as Bowden put it. But they may just throw
their red hats into the wild-card ring with the Mets, the Chicago
Cubs, St. Louis and any other teams unlikely to be division
champions but good enough to compete for the extra playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a deal where we didn't have to give up Casey or Tomko
or Young or any of our top prospects we're trying to build this
team around,'' Bowden said, explaining the Vaughn trade. ``We gave
up three players who weren't going to fit with us for a guy who hit
50 home runs last year. It's the first time in history a guy who
hit 50 home runs was traded the next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting Vaughn from the Padres was not difficult, Bowden said.
Getting approval for the additional expenditure from John Allen,
the Reds' managing executive, was.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bumps our payroll,'' Bowden said. ``It puts us $2.2 million
over budget. We'll be in the low 30s instead of the high 20s.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the initial reaction in Cincinnati, though, the
expenditure was worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phones haven't stopped ringing,'' the crafty general
manager said. ``People are buying season tickets, daily tickets,
everything. We've brought life back to this town. I thought the
reaction would be positive but not as positive as it's been. This
town's excited. It's still a great baseball town, but it doesn't
rock like it used to rock. It's fun to see the excitement again.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides hitting home runs and driving in runs, Vaughn will help
the Reds in two other ways, Bowden said. With five of the eight
everyday starters 26 years old or younger, he can take pressure
away from them, and he has played in a World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a real big proponent all my career of having people
who have been there,'' Bowden said. ``It will just make the younger
guys better.''
</P>
<P>
   No dummy, Bowden has a safety valve if the Reds don't thrust
themselves into the wild-card race in the first half of the season
and the fans become uninterested again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come July 20,'' he said, ``we'll know how much our young
players have developed. If they develop, we'll be better than
people thought we'd be. If not, I'll be sitting at the trading
deadline with Vaughn and Neagle. We gained a valuable asset in this
trade. Maybe we can make a run for it. If not, we have a couple
guys we can trade for some young prospects.''

EDITORIAL: WITNESSES FOR THE DEFENSE  
(DW)

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Feb. 7:
</P>
<P>
   The airing of Monica Lewinsky's videotaped testimony before the
Senate Saturday was less a legal than a political exercise. Her
comments and those of Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal added
little to the evidentiary record. What the testimony did provide,
apart from the chance for the nation to see Ms. Lewinsky address
the affair, was another opportunity for the House prosecutors to
try to give renewed velocity to what everyone now knows is a losing
case for removal.
</P>
<P>
   When historians someday consider the impeachment proceedings
against Bill Clinton, they will no doubt be struck by the political
and temperamental ravine that divided the House and the Senate in
this case. That gap has widened with the House impeachment
managers' failure to convince a skeptical Senate that President
Clinton's offenses are large enough to warrant discharging him from
office. The isolation and fervor of the House team were underscored
by the effort to paint the latest comments by Ms. Lewinsky, Jordan
and Blumenthal as crucial new evidence that strengthened the case
against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson skillfully used videotape excerpts to
reinforce the circumstantial case that Clinton did his best to keep
his affair with Ms. Lewinsky hidden and to impede the gathering of
testimony and evidence in the Paula Jones civil suit. But Ms.
Lewinsky, who parried many of Rep. Ed Bryant's questions, once
again denied that Clinton had directly instructed her to file a
false affidavit in the Jones case. Jordan ridiculed the idea that
he instructed Ms. Lewinsky to destroy romantic letters she had
written to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a lawyer and I'm a loyal friend,'' Jordan told Hutchinson,
``but I'm not a fool.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been clear from the opening days of the trial that the
partisan passions that stirred the House to impeach Clinton never
migrated across the Capitol to the Senate. That is as the framers
hoped when they constructed legislative bodies with such different
constituent bases and election rhythms, and required a two-thirds
majority to remove a president. But it also says something about
this group of House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with their impeachment case is not, as the House
managers would have it, that the Senate has denied the prosecution
a fair chance to present the evidence and witnesses. The problem is
that House Republicans misused the power of impeachment to deal
with presidential misconduct that deserves formal rebuke but not
the ultimate constitutional sanction of overturning an election.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde and his prosecution team will have one last
chance to make their case when they present closing arguments. But
as the trial enters its fifth and probably final week, the only
drama left is whether the Senate will find a way to censure Clinton
as it acquits him of impeachable offenses. This whole affair must
not end without a stinging condemnation of Clinton's behavior by
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, has drafted such a resolution
with the assistance of Robert Bennett, a Republican. It is gaining
support among Democrats. The resolution will need a handful of
Republican votes to pass, and a solid bipartisan majority to be
meaningful. Trent Lott, who has managed the trial with dignity and
respect for the Constitution, can write his place in history by
leading his Republican flock to support a sternly worded censure
resolution. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND LAKE, Colo. _ An arctic gale was blowing in Squeak Creek
as Ken Todd roared down from the Continental Divide, bucking his
snowmobile through drifts on a road in Rocky Mountain National
Park.
</P>
<P>
   It was a motorized tableau that a coalition of environmental
groups would like to erase from the National Park System. In a
midwinter attack, the coalition, called the Bluewater Network, has
petitioned Bruce Babbitt, the Interior Secretary, to ban
snowmobiles from the 28 places among the National Park System's 378
that allow them. In the Northeast, snowmobiling is allowed only in
the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area in Pennsylvania and
Acadia National Park in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   But the environmental coalition, representing an estimated 1
million members, is butting helmets with about 2.5 million
Americans, the estimated number of people who ride snowmobiles
every winter.
</P>
<P>
   Todd, pulling his machine out of a drift here, flipped up his
helmet visor and bellowed over the wind, ``The extremists would
have the parks shut down to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the environmental groups succeed, their petition
highlights sharpening conflict between snowmobile riders and
cross-country skiers on public lands. In National Forests, not part
of the Park System, managers are zoning land for motorized or
nonmotorized use. Here in Colorado this recreational segregation
has come as snowmobile riders have expanded their reach with more
powerful machines.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, public lands managers and the public are growing
less tolerant of the noise and air pollution from off-road
recreational vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years after they first became popular, snowmobiles are
still so noisy that they are sold without horns, and their
emissions are dirtier than the blue smoke pumped out by 1950s
automobiles. A modern snowmobile emits roughly 225 times the carbon
monoxide and 1,000 times the hydrocarbons and nitrous oxides of a
modern car, said Russell Long, executive director of Bluewater
Network.
</P>
<P>
   In a warning to snowmobile manufacturers, California adopted
pollution targets for personal watercraft in December, calling for
75 percent reductions in emissions of hydrocarbons and nitrous
oxides by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the personal watercraft manufacturers also make
snowmobiles,'' said Charles Emmett, an engineer for the California
Air Resources Board, a state agency charged with controlling air
pollution. ``So it is likely that they can adopt the same advanced
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   In moves that can cut hydrocarbon emissions by one third,
snowmobile manufacturers are shifting to biodegradable oils and to
gasohol, said Edward J. Klim, president of the International
Snowmobile Manufacturers Association, a trade group based in
Haslett, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Rated by snowmobile magazines as the nation's top snowmobiling
vacation spot, Yellowstone may have the clout to force
manufacturers to adopt cleaner technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Yellowstone also has become the poster park for the
environmental groups' attack. Of the six National Park areas that
receive more than 1,000 snowmobile visits a winter, Yellowstone
receives the most, 60,110 last winter.
</P>
<P>
   At the West Yellowstone entrance to the park, in Montana, carbon
monoxide accumulations have caused nausea in park rangers, forcing
the park to pump fresh air into ticket booths and to cut lines of
snowmobiles by selling tickets in town.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Montana Department of Environmental Quality
installed an air pollution monitor at West Yellowstone. Yellowstone
officials say that the park already has violated federal air
quality standards, sometimes surpassing pollution levels found in
Denver, the region's largest city.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 21, the Bluewater Network took a shotgun approach to
snowmobiling, petitioning Secretary Babbitt to close the National
Park System to snowmobiles, asking the Environmental Protection
Agency to set air and water pollution rules for snowmobiles, asking
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to regulate
snowmobiles for creating carbon monoxide health risks to workers,
and asking the National Transportation Safety Board and the
Consumer Product Safety Commission to study the high accident rates
among snowmobilers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A small minority of thrill seekers are turning our National
Parks into playgrounds at the expense of the majority who would
like to keep their National Parks with clean air quality and free
of all this noise,'' Bluewater's Long said from his office in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But the $6 billion-a-year snowmobile industry is enjoying a
renaissance on the wings of more reliable machines and warmer
clothing. After a deep slump in the 1980s, the number of
snowmobiles registered in the United States has rebounded to 1.4
million machines, close to the high of 1.6 million in 1978. Over
the last decade, the average price of a machine rose by 55 percent,
to $5,800, as aging baby boomers turned to snowmobiling as a way to
enjoy the outdoors in winter.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, clubs maintain 132,000 miles of snowmobile
trails, breathing economic life into dozens of remote towns. Here
in Grand Lake, which bills itself as Colorado's Snowmobile Capital,
snowmobile rentals pump nearly $2 million each season into a town
with a winter population of 369.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before snowmobiling, you could shoot a cannon down Grand
Avenue and not hit anybody,'' Lori Crane, who runs Spirit Lake
Polaris and Rentals, said as snowmobiles putt-putted down the main
street here, past shops and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Although snowmobile registrations in Colorado have doubled in a
decade, to almost 30,000, Snowmobile riders have free run of
Colorado's Arapaho National Forest, where there are no speed
limits. Next door, in Rocky Mountain National Park, they are
restricted to a 16-mile segment of Trail Ridge Road from town to
the Continental Divide, a vertical ascent of 2,000 feet with a
speed limit of 35 miles an hour regulated by radar. Cross-country
skiers and snowshoe users have all for themselves the rest of the
414-square mile National Park.
</P>
<P>
   In National Parks, snowmobiles are allowed only on roads or
lakes used by cars or boats in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are ours _ everybody's _ National Parks and Forests,''
said Brian Mahony, president of Grand Lake Trail Groomers, a club
that grooms 107 miles of snowmobile trails in the National Forest,
Colorado's largest trail network. ``When you ride over eight feet
of snow on the ground, there is, aside from the emissions, no
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Disagreement comes from Bob Bruce, who has a cabin near the
National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have 12-year-old kids driving snowmobiles at 80 miles an
hour down roads where you are not supposed to go over 25,'' said
Bruce, a computer company executive from Boulder. ``Over the
weekend, the noise is absolutely deafening. There is this whole
blue haze that hangs over the National Forest.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no hidden agenda, said Jasper Carlton, executive
director of the Biodiversity Legal Foundation, a Colorado group in
the Bluewater Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want snowmobiling out of the National Parks,'' he said.
``The Forest Service is next. When they refuse, we are going to sue
them.''

EDITORIAL: AFRICA'S FUTILE WAR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Feb. 7:
</P>
<P>
   Few nations can less afford to go to war than Ethiopia and
Eritrea, yet many of the 200,000 troops facing each other on their
common border were battling Saturday. The immediate cause is a
dispute over ownership of a 250-square-mile triangle of rocky land
of consequence to neither nation. The real problem is that leaders
of both countries feel compelled by honor to stand their ground.
The cost of their stubbornness could be one of the deadliest
international wars Africa has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is particularly tragic because Eritrea's
president, Isaias Afewerki, and Ethiopia's prime minister, Meles
Zenawi, were friends and allies who fought alongside each other
during the long guerrilla war that defeated Ethiopia's Marxist
dictator in 1991. Two years later, Eritrea, which had been a part
of Ethiopia, gained its independence, with Ethiopia's blessing.
Although they disagreed on where to mark their border, the two
nations promised to work it out. Although Isaias has since then
picked fights with several neighbors, the outside world viewed him
and Meles as two of Africa's most promising leaders.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of small aggressions by both sides in 1997 and
1998, Eritrean troops entered the disputed territory last May,
claiming it was rightfully Eritrean. The Organization of African
Unity, the U. N. Security Council and the United States have all
told Eritrea it must pull out its troops, and then let the U.N.
decide on the border and begin negotiations on the details. The two
sides have signaled that they might allow this, but they cannot
agree on who would administer the area while the border decision
was being made.
</P>
<P>
   Both countries seem to be doing their utmost to escalate this
seemingly minor dispute into a major war. Since last May, the two
nations _ among the poorest in the world _ have spent some $300
million on weapons. By its own count, Ethiopia has expelled 30,000
people of Eritrean descent, most of them Ethiopian citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International, which has documented even midnight
arrests of elderly hospital patients, claims the number is nearly
double that. The government says the deported belonged to
clandestine pro-Eritrean organizations, but it has provided no
proof to the deportees, some of whom do not know the specific
charges against them.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those targeted seem to be successful businessmen, whose
businesses are then closed or turned over to ethnic Ethiopians.
Eritrea, for its part, has no policy of deportation, but it has
created a climate of fear that has forced 22,000 ethnic Ethiopians
to leave. This ethnic-cleansing has strengthened hard-line views on
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   If there is still a chance to avoid war, the outside world must
play a part. Russia and other nations that are selling arms to the
region should end this shameful practice. The Organization of
African Unity, which has provided a good framework for
negotiations, must remain engaged. So must Washington, which has
sent Anthony Lake, the former national security adviser, to the
region four times since the crisis began.
</P>
<P>
   But the key is for Meles and Isaias to end their abuses and
bellicose rhetoric and look for a face-saving compromise. If they
do not, they will destroy the nations they spent decades struggling
to create.

CLINTON PROPOSES EXTENDING CONTROLS TO GUN SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Saturday that he would ask
Congress to require background checks on all people who bought
firearms at gun shows and flea markets, regardless of whether the
sellers were commercial gun dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton summarized his proposal this way: ``No background check,
no gun, no exceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address, Clinton said that gun shows were
becoming ``arms bazaars, where lawbreakers shop side by side with
the law-abiding.'' A new study by the Justice and Treasury
departments found that ``gun shows are a forum for gun traffickers,
a cash-and-carry convenience store for weapons used to maim and
kill,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1993 Brady Act, firearms dealers licensed by the
federal government must check the background of prospective buyers
to ensure that they are not felons, fugitives or illegal aliens.
Such dealers also must keep records of the sales.
</P>
<P>
   But, federal officials said, these requirements apply only to
licensed firearms dealers and those who must obtain licenses
because they regularly ``engage in the business'' of selling
firearms. The requirements do not apply to unlicensed individuals,
who account for at least one-fourth of the sellers at gun shows,
the administration said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should extend Brady checks and gun-tracing records to any
and all open markets where large numbers of firearms are sold,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Because unlicensed dealers are not required to inspect a buyer's
driver's license or other identification, they may not even know
that the purchaser is under the age of 18, the administration said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration said it had solicited the views of gun owners
and found them opposed to Clinton's proposal. For example, it said,
the National Rifle Association contends that only 2 percent of
firearms used by criminals come from gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   James E. Johnson, an undersecretary of the Treasury Department
who supervises the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said
the president's proposal would define ``gun show'' as any event
where ``two or more people are engaged in a sale of at least 50
firearms.'' Thus, the proposed new requirements would apply to some
flea markets, but not to an individual selling a personal gun
collection at a garage or yard sale.
</P>
<P>
   The restrictions ``do not affect unlicensed persons who buy or
sell a single firearm outside a gun show from another unlicensed
person,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration said that more than 4,400 gun shows were
advertised last year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the president's proposal, a licensed gun dealer would have
to be involved in every sale of firearms at a gun show. Unlicensed
sellers would have to arrange for buyers to go to a licensed dealer
to request a background check, through a computer system operated
by the FBI.

KNICKS VS. HEAT ... GET READY TO RUMBLE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Latrell Sprewell served his suspension last season, he got
his fill of basketball any way he could. Often that meant turning
on the television, where some playoff games made his adrenaline
flow more than others.
</P>
<P>
   He watched in stunned disbelief as Alonzo Mourning and Larry
Johnson began throwing punches in the final seconds of Game 4
between the Knicks and Miami Heat, a moment that upped the
emotional ante in their contentious and ugly rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, I just knew these teams didn't like each
other,'' Sprewell said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since that first-round series, the two
Atlantic Division combatants return to Madison Square Garden
Sunday. If they aren't ornery because of shared history, the fact
that the Knicks and Heat both lost their season openers on Friday
night should make for another decent scrum.
</P>
<P>
   After being nearly run off the Orlando Arena floor in a 93-85
loss, the Knicks may need the Heat to bring out some semblance of a
cohesive basketball team in them. They fell behind by 21 points to
the Magic and never found an offensive rhythm that lasted more than
two straight possessions in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat, meanwhile, melted down the stretch at home against
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to get back on the court because of tonight,''
Johnson said after the Knicks were beaten by Orlando. ``Not because
of Miami. It's not the playoffs. It's going to be a big game for
both of us because we both lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The game marks NBC's first National Basketball Association
telecast since Game 6 of the 1998 finals in Salt Lake City. It may
not be the kind of aesthetically-pleasing encounter the league
wants to showcase to begin the lockout-shortened season. But then,
Knicks-Heat never is.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two seasons, the rivalry's damage has been
excessive. Throw in their Game 5 melee in Miami in May of 1997 _
when Miami came back from a 3-1 deficit to stun the Knicks in the
second round _ and the two teams have lost a combined nine players
to suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning and Johnson were suspended for the final game of the
series last year. Johnson was also forced to miss Game 1 against
Indiana in the conference semifinals and Mourning was supposed to
have served the remaining game of his two-game suspension in this
year's season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the labor dispute, the NBA lifted the remaining game
of the suspension and Johnson was compensated for the money he lost
for missing the Pacers game.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the names and faces have changed since New York
eliminated Miami in five games last May, but the animosity remains
the same.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell is the most prominent new character, a talented player
with a troubled past who could dramatically alter the conference's
playoff picture. The Heat were in contention with the Knicks for
the rights to Sprewell, but backed off a potential trade with the
Golden State Warriors shortly before training camps opened.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Riley's refusal to pull the trigger on the prospective deal
could backfire, given that the starting shooting guard Voshon
Lenard began the season on the injured list with a stress fracture
in his shin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely happy to be with the Knicks,'' said Sprewell,
who led New York with 24 points in the season opener. ``For
whatever reason, I didn't end up there. I might be thinking about
that a little, but it won't affect how I approach the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Given all the jeering, Sprewell fared well in his first game in
14 months, making 8 of 16 shots and throwing down his first dunk as
a Knick with 11:18 left in the third quarter. He returns to the
Garden 10 days after his third-quarter explosion during a preseason
game with the Nets, a 17-point binge that earned him a standing
ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in New York has accepted me with open arms,'' he
said. ``I hope it continues, but I know I have to play well.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of his teammates on Friday night, he resorted to
one-on-one forays in a half-court offense that sapped the Knicks of
their offensive prowess. The ball stopped moving, the points
stopped coming and they literally fell apart in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the things that we talked about that could go wrong
offensively really did,'' said Coach Jeff Van Gundy. ``Even though
we shot a fairly good percentage, we really did not move the ball
the way I hoped to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we did throw the ball inside, we played fairly well. I
think we need to strike some balance between the perimeter and
post.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing also returns to the court against his friend and
nemesis, Mourning, for the first time in more than a year. Ewing
sat out the first-round series last May to rehabilitate a fractured
right wrist that forced him to miss the remainder of the regular
season as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to play, but the doctors told me I couldn't,'' Ewing
said. ``It was rough watching all of the games.
</P>
<P>
   He added after the Magic loss, ``I feel that I'm ready. I've
been working extremely hard. Tonight, we got outplayed, outhustled.
I've got to learn from my mistakes and hope it doesn't happen
Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing finished with 17 points and 9 rebounds in 38 minutes
against Orlando. He moved well at times, but also committed foolish
turnovers by stubbornly trying to back his defender into the post
with a high dribble.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Mourning and Miami can cure his and the team's ills after
a less-than-auspices debut. Maybe Riley's Heat will awake from
their opening-night slumber and further expose the Knicks'
deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, based on their history and what's at stake, it
should be good theater. For two warring franchises expected to
challenge Indiana for the conference title, an 0-2 start in a
50-game season is enough to make someone upset.  &QL;

HERMAN HERST JR., AN ESTEEMED STAMP COLLECTOR, DIES AT 89 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Fla., Va., Ore., London, Barbados)  By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Herman (Pat) Herst Jr., who was so enthralled by a stamp he saw
in a Manhattan store window when he was 7 that he grew up to be the
stamp world's most revered dealer, auctioneer and collector and by
far its most garrulous booster and most prolific authority, died on
Jan. 31 at his home in Boca Raton, Fla. He was 89 and had carried
his passion to such an extreme that he started his own postal
service.
</P>
<P>
   To suggest that Herst was a ubiquitous figure in philately would
hardly do justice to a man who once belonged to 81 stamp clubs,
rarely missed a major exhibition, made scores of stamp-scouting
trips abroad, wrote 18 books and thousands of columns about stamp
news.
</P>
<P>
   He gave hundreds of speeches, and spent so much time on his
voluminous personal correspondence that it is a wonder he had any
left over for his myriad other interests, including the American
Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church
and State, Citizens for Religious Liberty and Baker Street
Irregulars.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Herst's contributions to philately were so widely
recognized that he won every honor of consequence in the United
States, including the American Philatelic Society's Luff award, and
several in Britain, where he was so esteemed that he became the
only American ever elected to the board of the august Philatelic
Traders Society.
</P>
<P>
   For all his later achievements in philately, it was some years
before Herst's childhood enthusiasm became his life's focus.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a New York lawyer, also named Herman Herst Jr., who
died when he was 4, Herst adopted the junior. But once his boyhood
friends found that he was born on St. Patrick's Day, he was never
called anything except Pat.
</P>
<P>
   To make ends meet, his Oregon-born mother, Lillian Myers Herst,
played first violin in John Philip Sousa's all-female orchestra,
leaving her rambunctious son so unsupervised that when he was 12
she packed him off to her sister's home in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   After studying international law at Reed College and receiving a
master's degree from the University of Oregon, he returned to New
York in 1932 and was soon working as a $12-a-week runner for a Wall
Street bond house.
</P>
<P>
   A chance delivery to a millionaire stamp dealer, then the center
of American philately, reawakened Herst's interest in stamps and
laid the groundwork both for his career and his later outpouring of
books, beginning in 1960 with ``Nassau Street.''
</P>
<P>
   After organizing his fellow bond house employees into a
syndicate that made a minor killing when Herst tracked down a
supply of a much sought-after series of silver jubilee
commemoratives issued by the Republic of Nauru, a small
island-nation in the central Pacific, he used his profits to set up
shop at in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   Herst began holding the auctions that became his stock in trade
and turning out a newsletter, Herst's Outbursts, which established
his reputation for solid expertise and entertaining anecdotes. He
was soon contributing columns to virtually every stamp publication
in the country, a practice he continued until shortly before his
death.
</P>
<P>
   A man who saw stamps, and especially their envelopes, or covers,
as windows into history, Herst, whose concentrations included early
British historical stamps, was an enthusiastic collector.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a vast postwar proliferation of stamps that made
it impossible to collect them all, he became a champion of the
topical collecting movement, in which collectors specialize in
stamps that depict, for example, dogs or nursing mothers, or in one
of Herst's specialties, covers posted from high-altitude places
listing the elevation.
</P>
<P>
   A two-year sojourn in England in the late 1930s made him a
familiar figure to British stamp collectors, so much so that when
Herst, who had returned to the United States with an English wife
in 1938, made his first postwar visit to London, in 1948, he
received a standing ovation when he walked into the Stampex show.
</P>
<P>
   Herst's appearance, he was told, was the first sign that the
British stamp business was returning to normal after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Thereafter, British dealers hoarded American stamps for Herst.
</P>
<P>
   Herst was as well-known in New York, where his office became
such a popular gathering spot for idlers that to get some work done
he closed it in 1945 and moved his operations to Shrub Oak, N.Y.,
40 miles north of Manhattan in Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   It was a reflection of Herst's impact on the little community of
674 people that when he moved into a house across from the post
office, the 100,000 pieces of mail generated by his business each
year led it to be upgraded to second-class from third-class status.
</P>
<P>
   Even then there were no deliveries from Friday to Monday, a
matter of some inconvenience for a town that served as a weekend
getaway for New Yorkers. So in 1953, having discovered an obscure
1862 law that allowed such supplemental services, Herst opened a
private mail service, using first his children and later his German
shepard, Alfie, to deliver the mail for 2 cents a letter.
</P>
<P>
   In time, his privately issued stamps, including one depicting
Alfie, became collectors items even as his initiative led scores of
other philatelists to set up similar private post offices across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Herst continued to hold regular auctions in New York until 1973,
when he and his second wife moved to Florida, where he quickly
became the state's leading philatelist and donated his extensive
library to Florida Atlantic University.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, Ida, Herst is survived by two children,
Kenneth, of Springfield, Va., and Patricia Held of Centerville,
Va.; two stepchildren, Gary K. Busch of London and Gail C. Busch of
Manhattan; six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Even in his later years, however, Herst never forgot the stamp
that caught his eye when he was 7 and awakened his interest in
philately. How could he? The tricolor Barbados design showing a
ship became the pattern for a throw rug he kept in his house.

GREENE IS RUNNING RIGHT, WHICH MEANS VICTORIES
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By RON DICKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ World's Fastest Human: It's a title that rarely
sticks.
</P>
<P>
   But Maurice Greene, who has worn the distinction for a year, has
a plan to keep it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole year is about being injury free,'' Greene said
Friday night after winning the 60 meters in the Chase Millrose
Games at Madison Square Garden in 6.51 seconds. ``An injury can be
traumatizing to a career. The best way to run injury free is to run
technically right.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene, 23, won every indoor race he entered in 1998 and set a
world indoor record in the 60 meters of 6.39 seconds. Outdoors, he
cracked 10 seconds in the 100 meters 10 times, earning the No. 1
ranking in the world after being No. 2 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Every Monday, Greene bounds into the track stadium at UCLA and
gushes about the California weather and the privilege of doing what
he loves to do. His coach, John Smith, and his training partners,
Jon Drummond and Ato Boldon, listen patiently before they get on
with their workout.
</P>
<P>
   Greene calls the 30-year-old Drummond ``old and fat'' in
practice. On race day, Greene says nothing. All Drummond said he
heard Friday were ``the whispers, the little giggles, the little
rap songs'' from the other sprinters.
</P>
<P>
   Greene has a reputation for steely concentration which can block
out the mind games that often precede a sprint. But he suffered a
rare mental lapse in front of 15,822 fans Friday night. He broke
last out of the blocks and had to surge in the final 10 meters to
edge Drummond for the second straight year. ``I need to work on my
reaction time,'' Greene said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said: ``If you beat Maurice, it's because you've done
everything right. When Maurice is on top of his game, he's
difficult to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   When his game is off, Greene compensates with acceleration.
</P>
<P>
   ``He blew right by me, which he does,'' Drummond said.
</P>
<P>
   Greene will run today in Boston, at the U.S. indoor
championships in Atlanta on Feb. 26-27 and the at world indoors in
Japan the following week. He thrives on the intimacy of indoor
track meets.
</P>
<P>
   Greene celebrated his Millrose victory by tossing out T-shirts
with ``Phenomenon'' silk-screened on the front.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to peak for the world indoors because I have a
long outdoor season,'' he said. ``If I do what I'm doing now, I
believe I'll win indoors.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene is pointing toward the world championships in Seville,
Spain, in August, the biggest meet besides the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Smith believes Greene is capable of running in the 9.8's in the
100 meters, threatening Donovan Bailey's world record of 9.84.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's vow to stay injury free stems from painful experience.
After winning three straight Kansas state high school 100 and 200
titles, Greene pulled a hamstring muscle so badly in 1994 that he
missed a year. He bounced back to stun Carl Lewis in the Texas
Relays the following season and placed second in the national
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, he blazed through 100-meter heats of 9.84 seconds
(wind-aided) and 9.96 before withdrawing from the national final
because of cramps.
</P>
<P>
   Greene has logged other disappointments. He trudged to a
seventh-place finish in a quarterfinal heat of the 1996 Olympic
trials.
</P>
<P>
   The next season, after winning the 100 at the world
championships, Greene was poised to anchor the United States'
4-by-100 relay team, but he never got the baton. The squad was
disqualified for an out-of-zone pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't pay attention to losing,'' Smith said. ``He pays
attention to winning.''
</P>
<P>
   He is, after all, the World's Fastest Human.
</P>
<P>
   ``He deserves that title,'' Drummond said. ``He won the world
championships. He's the world indoor record holder. Respect
that.'' &QL;

WASSILY LEONTIEF, ECONOMIST WHO WON NOBEL, DIES AT 93 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Calif. Vt., Germany, Russia)  By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE 
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wassily Leontief, who won the Nobel prize in
economics in 1973 for his analyses of America's production
machinery, showing how changes in one sector of the economy can
exact changes all along the line, affecting everything from the
price of oil to the price of peanut butter, died Friday night at
the New York University Medical Center. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   His analytic methods, as the Nobel committee observed, were
adopted and became a permanent part of production planning and
forecasting in scores of industrialized nations and in private
corporations all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Following the model of his so-called input-output analysis,
General Electric, for example, was able to load data from 184
sectors of the economy _ such as energy, home construction and
transportation _ into a mammoth computer to help it predict how the
energy crisis brought on by the Arab oil boycott in 1973 would
affect public demand for its products and services, from light
bulbs to turbines.
</P>
<P>
   A well-known academic figure, Leontief was the director of the
Institute for Economic Analysis of New York University from 1975
until 1991; even after his retirement he was still teaching courses
at the university into his 90s. Before coming to NYU. he taught
economics at Harvard for 44 years and directed large research
projects there as well.
</P>
<P>
   Leontief was a thinker who often complained that too many of his
academic colleagues spent too much time staring out their office
windows instead of being out in the field, as any good economist
ought to be, counting things. ``Facts,'' he said. ``You have to
have facts. Theories aren't good unless you have facts to back
them.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked how he developed the input-output analysis recognized
by his Nobel memorial prize, he would invariably begin, ``Oh, it's
really very simple _ what I wanted to do was collect facts.'' The
facts he sought were those that explained how segments of
production were interconnected.
</P>
<P>
   He showed that if you carefully studied changes in the cost and
components of one type of product, you could determine the
resulting changes in cost and components of others along the
production chain.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you have a sudden rise the price of oil or steel?
Leontief taught government officials and corporate executives to
track how this influenced the costs of production in other segments
of a local or national economy, both within an industry or more
broadly across many industries and many nations.
</P>
<P>
   Wassily Leontief was born Aug. 5, 1905, in St. Petersburg, the
son of Wassily W. Leontief, an economist, and the former Eugenia
Bekker. A brilliant student, he was allowed to enroll when he was
only 15 years old at the newly renamed University of Leningrad. But
he got in trouble almost immediately by expressing vehement
opposition to the lack of intellectual and personal freedom under
the country's Communist regime, which had taken power three years
earlier. He was arrested as he was nailing up anti-Communist
posters on the wall of a military barracks and placed in solitary
confinement. Released after several days, he promptly resumed his
anti-Communist activities and was arrested several more times.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in 1925, he was allowed to leave the country, a turn of
fate he attributed to a growth on his neck. He said the authorities
believed that the growth was cancerous and that he would die and be
of no use to the state. He left Russia to resume his studies in
economics at the University of Berlin, and his parents soon
followed. The growth was benign and he completed his doctorate in
1929. He spent a year as an economist advising the government of
China, particularly on the planning of a new railroad network.
</P>
<P>
   Then he came to the United States and worked briefly in New York
at the National Bureau of Economic Research, where his published
work quickly attracted attention and Harvard invited him to join
its economics faculty. He agreed provided the university help him
to develop his ideas about production. Harvard gave him a research
assistant and a $2,000 grant to develop the basic system of
input-output analysis that the world was to adopt. He and his
assistant began constructing a table covering 42 American
industries, taking months to compile figures and perform
calculations that computers would latter handle in fractions of
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   During the war, he helped the U.S. government with planning for
wartime industrial production, worked as a consultant to the Office
of Strategic Services and supervised compilation of a
92-economic-sector table for the Department of Labor. In 1948,
Leontief set up the Harvard Research Project on the Structure of
the American Economy with the aid of large grants from the Ford and
Rockefeller Foundations and the Air Force to further expand and
refine his input-output models. Soon he had a staff of 20 _ and 650
punch-card computer from IBM, then the state-of-the art.
</P>
<P>
   He did not, however, keep the Air Force grant long once the
Eisenhower administration came to power; some of its officials were
critical of his input-output theory as smacking too much of a
planned economy. That was what he thought it should smack of.
</P>
<P>
   One of his goal's in studying the nature of changes in
industrial production was to enable nations to plan in ways that
would be economically beneficial and help them avoid periods of
economic hardship. But to some economists the idea of national
economic planning was ill-advised: not only would it not work, they
thought, but it might make matters worse and also might open the
door to excessive government control. They maintained it would be
better to let the private sector and the free market determine the
course of future economic events.
</P>
<P>
   To Leontief, it seemed short-sighted for nations to devote
little or no thought to the analysis of the future of the overall
economy, especially after what he regarded as the effective work of
modern economists in devising projections that are mathematically
and statistically sound. He spoke out often on the subject in the
1970s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He and Leonard Woodcock, then president of the United Auto
Workers, proposed that the federal government establish an Office
of National Economic Planning to help coordinate economic projects
and make recommendations on policies they said could avert
unnecessary unemployment, inflation, failures in health care,
shortages in affordable housing, energy, public transportation and
other requirements of a civilized society.
</P>
<P>
   The idea never materialized. If anything, the generation of
younger economists who followed him, many of whom he taught,
developed less respect for the abilities of national governments to
plan for the long term. It bothered him greatly that toward the end
of the century many Americans seemed to have lost broad faith in
their government's ability to improve the lot of its citizens,
particularly through economic programs.
</P>
<P>
   In an Op-Ed article in The New York Times in 1992, he said there
was little doubt that the U.S. government had played a important
role in a generally prosperous economy for more than half the
century, from ending the Great Depression in the '30s to guiding
the nation through most of the rest of the century in generally
sounder economic health than most of the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Leontief always was fearful that employment problems would
accompany widespread use of the high-speed computers that he
himself relied on almost from the moment they first became
applicable for nonmilitary purposes after World War II. He warned
that computers would be for many workers what the tractor was to
the horse _ great for the farmer but not great for the horse.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in 1996, when he was 90, Leontief, noting the
trend toward corporate downsizing, said: ``Individual entrepreneurs
will continue to do better and better and better, but significant
segments of the work force will do worse and worse. Ultimately,
governments will have to play a role in arbitrating and correcting
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Leontief seemed to grow more liberal with age. During the
student protests on the Harvard campus in 1969, he split with most
senior faculty members and joined with a younger group more
sympathetic to the protesting students. In 1975, he resigned from
Harvard, where he was the Henry Lee professor of economics and
chairman of the university's Society of Fellows, its most
distinguished group of scholars. He left a year ahead of schedule,
complaining that too often teachers at the graduate level did not
teach and researchers did not do research.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before he resigned, he joined an internal report
criticizing Harvard's economics department, which had long been
regarded as among the world's best. The report said that the
department had failed to adequately recruit minority faculty
members, that it took an overly narrow approach in scholarship and
that a ``deterioration in attitudes and relationships'' had
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   At NYU, he continued to expand his work on input-output analysis
and helped foreign nations adopt it. China was among the last to do
so, as it intensified its industrialization in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Wassily Leontief, a balletomane and connoisseur of fine wines,
said he also thought of himself as a squire of Willoughby Brook in
northern Vermont, where he and his family had a summer home. It was
all very well to be an internationally regarded scholar, but
landing a beautiful brook trout, he would say with his sly smile,
was his passion.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Estelle Helena Marks, a writer, whom
he married in 1932, his daughter, Svetlana Alpers, the art
historian, author, and professor of fine arts at the University of
California at Berkeley, and two grandsons.

EDITORIAL   OBSERVER: WALLS AND STONEWALLS AT NEW YORK'S CITY HALL
 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ELEANOR RANDOLPH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The police officers along the new fencing outside
City Hall are reasonably civil. On a recent weekday, an officer sat
in his patrol car and asked a prospective visitor, ``What is your
business here?''  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Being a mere citizen no longer counts as an adequate response.
One needs an official badge, an appointment, a good reason. This is
not the people's City Hall; there is no eating lunch or holding
big, unfriendly rallies on its sunny front steps. It is Fortress
Rudy, Mayor Giuliani's walled castle.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the wall is supposed to be temporary construction
fencing while the city upgrades the surrounding park. What remains
permanent will be for safety's sake. There are real nuts out there
with guns, terrorists with plots. No prudent person could oppose
consistent safeguards against the general danger and stringent,
well-explained responses to specific threats. Some inconvenience is
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the scene is Lafayette Park in Washington or lower
Manhattan, balance and atmospherics count. The same walls that
protect against the bad or even the weird also keep out the
do-gooder, the honest dissenter and the creative eccentric. They
can chill the civic air where democracy must breathe. The delicate
balance between security and freedom at City Hall seems to have
tilted, at least for now, in favor of the chain-link fence.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more disturbing is the thought that these fences
stand as a visual metaphor for how New York City now operates. The
barriers to City Hall are compounded by other barriers to public
data, to information, to even talking to anyone in the city
government except the man with the microphone, Giuliani himself.
 &UR;  &LR; At a forum last week sponsored by the Columbia University Graduate
School of Journalism, First Amendment lawyers and journalists told
war stories about what it is like to try to cover the city's
business. Some of it was your usual grumbling by reporters who are
not happy unless they are standing on the chalk marks at a murder
scene. But most of the complaints were about the extraordinary
difficulty of gathering the bits and strands of data that should be
available to anyone in a free society.
</P>
<P>
   Gabe Pressman of WNBC, now president of the New York Press Club,
groused that, ``No administration in my experience has been so
heavy-handed.'' Pressman's experience covers eight New York mayors,
he said, back to William O'Dwyer, who left office in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Browne, senior managing editor of The Daily News, fumed
about how the state's Freedom of Information Law, called FOIL, has
now become exactly that under the Giuliani administration. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  ``You have turned the law on its head,'' Browne told Giuliani
supporters at the breakfast. Obtaining ordinary information like
restaurant inspections or the list of people at a mayoral reception
can now require a process that takes three months. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  The law intended to open data to the press and public is being
used to ``delay, delay, delay,'' Browne said.
</P>
<P>
   The media and their customers are not the only victims here. The
Giuliani administration has often locked its most routine filing
cabinets to public-interest groups and even other government
agencies. The City Comptroller, in a recent report on New York
police officers holding civilian jobs, gives eight pages of details
about how hard it was to get the city's police department to
cooperate. The State Comptroller's office has been forced to sue
the mayor for basic information.
</P>
<P>
   In other First Amendment cases, including two filed by The New
York Times for access to information, the law has not been friendly
to the Giuliani administration. The city has lost a dozen or so
court battles over freedom of access and information, and some
lawyers have begun to wonder whether the real goal may not be
winning but stalling.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor protests that he is out there personally answering
questions from the press and public every day, but some questions,
just like some citizens, fare better than others.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter asked recently whether former Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato was in City Hall to lobby about a soccer team, Giuliani
scoffed. D'Amato is ``just like anyone else who can come in and
talk about possibilities,'' the mayor said.
 &UR;  &LR;  Anyone else, of course, still has to get through the fence.

NO TREATS FOR THIS HONORED HOUND

(JT) 
 By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's a floppy, 4-year-old basset hound from Plano, Texas. They
are the members of a 123-year-old private men's club who make or
break dogs like him with impunity. But Ch. Morningwood Ulysses S.
Grant has a bone to pick with the scions who run the Westminster
Kennel Club Dog Show.
</P>
<P>
   Why won't they let him show himself off at their show? He is,
after all, something of an Adonis for his low-slung breed.
</P>
<P>
   The 71-pound hound, nicknamed HRH _ for His Royal Highness _ by
his handler, Pat Willer, hoofed it to 65 dog shows last year and
finished 1998 ranked the second-best basset in the nation. That
more than qualified him to compete in the Westminster show at
Madison Square Garden Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not receive anything resembling royal treatment from
the dog show's entry committee. In fact, his $40 entry was refused,
because its arrival at the show superintendent's office in
Greensboro, N.C., on Nov. 12 was recorded at 8:08 a.m., one minute
after Westminster's limit of 2,500 entries had been received.
</P>
<P>
   According to show officials, entries for the 1999 show opened
and closed in a record seven minutes. By the time MB-F Inc., the
99-year-old company that manages the show and presides over its
controversial entry process, had recorded the 11th bundle of
entries delivered that morning _ the one that contained HRH's form
_ the quota had already been reached.
</P>
<P>
   Among those first 2,500 were sprinkled representatives of 152 of
the 153 breeds recognized by the American Kennel Club (only the
Finnish spitz was missing), plus a full slate of top contenders and
familiar faces.
</P>
<P>
   None of the nine bassets who made the cut have HRH's
credentials. But it's the luck of the draw that makes the process
democratic, according to Westminster administrators, who estimate
they receive 5,000 entries for the 2,500 spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a more equitable way to process the entries,
Westminster's willing to listen,'' said Thomas Bradley, a club
member who also functions as Westminster's public relations agent.
``But so far, the wheel is still round.''
</P>
<P>
   And HRH is still odd man out. So when the rest of the hounds
strut their stuff for the cameras at the Garden on Tuesday, HRH,
who stood a serious chance of going best-in-breed because of the
absence of Ch. Deer Hill's Great Gatsby, the nation's No. 1 basset
and No. 2 dog all-breeds, will be at home with Willer in Sulphur,
La.
</P>
<P>
   HRH's owner, David Keene, is so peeved on behalf of his spurned
hound that he has threatened legal action. He would not be the
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get offered bribes by owners who want their dogs let into
Westminster, we've been threatened with bodily harm by owners whose
dogs didn't get into Westminster, and we hear all the time from
lawyers who are going to investigate the entry process,'' said
Dorie Crowe, vice-president of the family-run MB-F, which
coordinates and produces dog shows across the country. Crowe denied
that anything such as a favor to other owners involved in the
refusal to admit Keene's well-respected basset to this year's show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not about to do something that could jeopardize the
reputation of a 100-year-old company for the sake of one entry,''
she said. ``We could lose our license.''
</P>
<P>
   Keene wouldn't mind seeing that; but because the recording of
entries is a closed process, he has only his raised hackles for
proof of malfeasance. A basset-loving vice-president of the Summit
Acceptance Corp in Plano, Keene is not the first owner of a
champion canine to be shut out of Westminster in what he considers
dubious circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's 10,000 people who'd like to talk about this, like to
see some accountability for how the system works, and 9,999 who are
scared to,'' he said. ``If I knew my entry got there at 1 p.m. I
wouldn't say a word, but it was signed in at 8:08 a.m. And why is
it that the very top dogs and top handlers always get in?'' Keene
said he hired a mathematician who calculated the odds of
Westminster's being able to represent its full 153-breed roster in
just seven minutes ``at four million to one.''
</P>
<P>
   Keene is the first owner to make his anger public, and fears
that if he is correct that Westminster picks and chooses among its
entries, he and his hound could find themselves blackballed next
year, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Catch-22,'' he said of his complaint. ``But let me tell
you, this really takes the wind out of your sails. It's like having
a goal, and going by the book and doing everything right that it
takes to get there, and then at the end being told you can't get
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Keene and his wife, Barba, campaigned HRH heavily, and
successfully, last year, spending $50,000. After a decade in
bassets, they knew that they finally had a true champion, and more.
Which is why this hurts more.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when HRH was a puppy, Barba Keene was undergoing
chemotherapy for breast cancer. HRH, for reasons best known to him,
decided she couldn't live without him. Her sick bed was his bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'd be lying there in pain, and he'd let her grab onto him
and hold him as hard as she needed to,'' David Keene said. ``They
bonded unbelievably; he was right there for her then. It's broken
her heart that he didn't get to go to Westminster this year after
he's done everything in the show ring to earn his way.''
</P>
<P>
   Willer, the dog's trainer, said, ``This year we've heard more
complaints about entries than ever.'' Willer has been in the dog
business for 30 years and terms it ``very paranoid and very
political.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the entry process is closed to us tells me all I
need to know,'' Willer said. ``I wouldn't go as ballistic as the
Keenes did, but I'm extremely disappointed we didn't make it to
Westminster. They shouldn't say they've got the most prestigious of
all the dog shows if they're not letting all the best dogs in.'' &QL;

 By STEPHEN KINZER  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ISTANBUL _ The folk and pop singer Baris Manco, who had great
cultural influence in Turkey and became one of the country's most
beloved figures, died here on Monday. He was 56 and lived in
Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, relatives said.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people, many in tears, turned out on
Wednesday for his funeral, which was broadcast live on national
television. ``Today, we as a nation feel pain in our hearts for
having lost a great artist and a good friend,'' Culture Minister
Istemihan Talay said in his eulogy.
</P>
<P>
   Manco wrote and recorded more than 200 songs, many of which not
only became hits on the pop charts but also found their way into
the rural popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   He was an arresting personality who dressed outlandishly in
clothes he designed himself, and he covered his fingers with rings.
In the 1970s, when Turkey had only a single state-owned television
channel, he was offered appearances on condition that he cut his
flowing hair. He refused, and the authorities finally relented,
making him the first representative of the alternative youth
culture to appear on Turkish television.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his songs, Manco was known widely for his weekly
television program. He was its host for nearly a decade, making it
the longest-running Turkish television show. The first segment was
aimed at young people, and a generation of Turks grew up with his
children's songs, like ``My Friend the Donkey.''
</P>
<P>
   The second part consisted of travel documentaries. Manco
traveled continually, and his documentaries helped educate Turks
about foreign countries, peoples and cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Besides bringing the world into Turkish living rooms, he was
also an unofficial Turkish ambassador. His songs were translated
into many languages, and he was awarded official honors in several
countries. He had wide followings in Arab countries, Central Asia
and the Caucasus and was especially popular in Japan, where he
produced children's programs.
</P>
<P>
   In a flood of front-page commentaries after his death, Turkish
newspapers hailed him as one of the few Turks who managed to bridge
the gap between the educated elite and common people.
</P>
<P>
   Manco was born in Istanbul on Jan. 2, 1943, and began his career
by founding a rock band when he was in high school. He studied
graphic design and textile design in Belgium, where he was later
made a Chevalier of the Order of Leopold II. He is survived by his
wife, Lale, and two sons, Dogukan and Batikan.
</P>
<P>
   An avid collector, Manco had a fleet of British cars from the
1950s and important collections of Japanese and Chinese porcelain,
19th-century Orientalist paintings and Art Deco and Art Nouveau
glassware.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his proudest possession, however, was his first name,
which means ``peace'' in Turkish.

 &HT;    Taking spotlight off anthrax threats lessens incidents in some
cities
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Anthrax. It is everywhere and nowhere. And in between
are dozens of local and federal law enforcement, fire and health
departments running ragged in response to threats of the deadly
bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Attorney's Office in Buffalo, N.Y. A night club in Los
Angeles. An abortion provider in Wichita, Kan. A Catholic school in
Indianapolis. All have been victims of anthrax scares in the past
six months.
</P>
<P>
   To date, every threat of anthrax contamination in the United
States has been false, according to the FBI, which leads
investigations into such cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI views these as the bomb threats of the '90s,'' said
Paul Moskal, an FBI agent in Buffalo, where a spate of anthrax
threats received last month was partially linked to teen-agers.
``Given the world situation, you have to take these threats
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason: airborne anthrax is deadly. If spores of the
bacteria, naturally found in livestock, get into a person's lungs,
their toxins can multiply rapidly, causing severe illness or death.
For more than a decade, terrorists have threatened to use anthrax
to wage germ warfare in the United States and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Cities that have lived through numerous anthrax threats and
``copycat'' scares, such as Buffalo and Los Angeles, have developed
an effective response.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to downplay it and low-key it,'' said Moskal. ``The
threats died down here after the local media didn't cover them.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories about anthrax threats no longer make the front page of
the Buffalo News. Typically, they are briefs inside the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's response Thursday to an anthrax scare at Midtown's
Colony Square is typical for a first-time threat: a swarm of
firetrucks, police, ambulances, FBI agents, terrorism experts,
public health officials and a Hazmat team dressed in special blue
suits made for chemical and biological warfare. Buildings are
evacuated, streets sealed off, temporary shower stalls erected and
decontamination rituals undertaken to remove the invisible germ.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain procedures are in place and have to be followed. Until
we determine what the substance is, we don't treat them as
hoaxes,'' said Jay Spadafore of Atlanta's FBI office. ``I don't
even like to use the word `hoax.' They are all felonies.''
</P>
<P>
   Conviction of deploying _ or threatening to use _ a chemical or
biological weapon of mass destruction could result in life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``People caught will be punished and punished severely,'' said
Moskal. ``These are not pranks. This is not like pulling the fire
alarm at school. Lives are put in danger responding to these
calls.''
</P>
<P>
   The calls also tie up police, firefighters and paramedics, who
could be responding to legitimate emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, the cost of responding to one anthrax incident
was estimated by at $50,000. Southern California stores, nightclubs
and schools were among the targets of a round of threats in
November and December.
</P>
<P>
   But after three false alarms, L.A. emergency officials took
another tack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met with all the principals involved in response and with
the FBI, and the FBI told us if you don't send out the red lights
and sirens to these calls, the (copycat anthrax) threats would
trickle off, and sure enough they did,'' said Darrell Higuchi,
deputy chief of the L.A. County Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   Anthrax threats now are handled in the same manner as bomb
threats in Los Angeles, Higuchi said. The police dispatch just one
special team to the scene that then quickly assess the credibility
of the threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of ways of assessing the credibility of these
threats, but we can't really going around discussing them,''
Higuchi said. ``We don't want people knowing what we do know and
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``We haven't had any (anthrax) threats since the
seven incidents in late November and December.

 &HT;    Costs of gun violence difficult to trace
 &HT;    WITH NRA-INFLUENCE
 &HT;    By Carlos Campos
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the city of Atlanta filed suit against 14 gun
makers last week, it claimed that taxpayers have for too long borne
the cost of police, emergency services and other expenses related
to the deaths and injuries caused by their products.
</P>
<P>
   But putting a price tag on those costs is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the attempts that have been made focus not on police
costs, but on health care costs associated with treating gunshot
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Although the city is asking for millions of dollars, Mayor Bill
Campbell could not provide the specific costs the city must bear
due to homicides, suicides and accidental shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not do health-related issues, but nevertheless, there
are of course costs that we suffer, police costs ... just the
incalculable cost of family tragedy,'' the mayor said. ``I think
it's incalculable, really.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
which has declared gun violence a national epidemic, hasn't
attempted to assign a public cost to gun-related deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to measure the costs of gun violence even on a
medical level,'' said Grady Memorial Hospital emergency room
physician Dr. Arthur Kellerman, who also heads Emory University's
Injury Control Center. ``One, very few cities have systematically
collected information on the magnitude of their gun problems. And
second, one of the biggest issues in gun violence is the long-term
disability and length of recovery for gun violence victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulton and DeKalb county taxpayers, who contribute between $90
and $100 million per year to Grady, often end up absorbing the cost
of caring for gunshot victims, Kellerman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The costs are very real and they're not often borne by the
victims,'' Kellerman said. ``A substantial percentage of victims in
urban areas, and in rural areas, don't have health inurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there have been several attempts to put a cost on
gun-related deaths and injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Vernick, professor of public health and associate director
of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy &AMP; Research, said widely
cited research includes:
</P>
<P>
   _ A study published in 1995 in the Journal of American Medical
Association in which a professor at the University of California at
Davis estimated the national health care costs for gun-related
injuries at $4 billion for one year.
</P>
<P>
   _ A 1992 study by another University of California at Davis
professor, estimating that 80 percent of health care costs for
gun-related injuries are borne by taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Vernick noted that those studies only look at health care costs,
not police costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post in 1997 traced the costs to taxpayers of
treating a teen-ager paralyzed after he was struck by a stray
bullet. In just 14 months, the cost of a trial, the teenager's
medical treatment and rehabilitation, and the convicted defendant's
prison stay totaled $268,496. The newspaper estimated that future
costs could climb as high as $1.79 million _ for a single shooting.

 &HT;    NRA continues to influence Southern politics
 &HT;    By Charles Walston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In Southern politics, the postcard listing the
endorsements of the National Rifle Association is a powerful
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Although opponents of the nation's largest gun rights group say
its clout in Washington has declined, they admit the NRA still
wields enormous influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are places where the NRA endorsement is the kiss of
death,'' said Kristen Rand, director of federal policy for the
Violence Policy Center, a Washington-based anti-gun group. ``But
they still have a lot of power in a lot of Southern legislatures.''
</P>
<P>
   That has been demonstrated this year in states such as Georgia,
where the NRA is pushing a bill that would outlaw lawsuits against
gun manufacturers by local governments. The city of Atlanta filed
such a suit Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The bill easily passed the House and unanimously cleared the
Senate Public Safety Committee, but hit a snag on the Senate floor
Friday when some Atlanta Democrats teamed with Republicans to delay
it on a procedural vote. The Republicans indicated, however, that
they voted against the measure only in an effort to expand it to
the manufacturers of all products, not just guns.
</P>
<P>
   While Atlanta is the fifth city to file a lawsuit against gun
makers, Georgia is the first state where the NRA has tried to pass
a bill to block such suits, said James Baker, the NRA's chief
lobbyist. The choice to fight the battle here is no coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Georgia is one of our stronger states,'' said Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia lawmakers who would defy the NRA face a double-barreled
threat: votes and money.
</P>
<P>
   The group claims 93,000 members in Georgia, and most of them
vote, said Baker. Hence the power of the orange postcards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our members are very much activists when it comes to
their gun rights,'' said Baker. ``They also vote in a higher
percentage than the population at large, which makes them a very
potent force in any election or legislative battle.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to rallying its troops behind candidates it
endorses, the NRA is a generous campaign contributor. The group's
political action committee spent about $5 million in federal and
local races around the country last year, according to reports it
filed.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, the NRA Political Victory Fund gave $52,321 to state
and local candidates in 1998, and $41,550 to federal candidates. In
1997, the Victory Fund gave $21,500 to state candidates.
</P>
<P>
   All of the federal candidates in Georgia who got NRA money last
year were Republicans, reflecting the group's national leaning. But
the Victory Fund also supported many Democrats in state races,
including Gov. Roy Barnes, who got the maximum $5,000 contribution
from the group.

DISPOSING OF A PAID-UP MORTGAGE
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before consigning your paid-off mortgage to the ash
heap, real-estate lawyers say, it would be wise to consider whether
you should blow out that match. For, they say, it's possible that a
mortgage from the past can return to haunt you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in favor of burning important documents,'' said
Douglas Wasser, a Manhattan real-estate lawyer. ``You never know
when you might need them.''
</P>
<P>
   The prime reason, he said, is because the original mortgage may
be needed if the lien against the property has not been recorded as
removed.
</P>
<P>
   Wasser explained that one of the reasons lenders consider
mortgages safe investments is because the borrower's promise to
repay the loan is backed by a pledge of the borrower's property _ a
house, for example _ as security. Since houses can be sold,
however, the lender wants to make sure that anyone thinking about
buying the house will know there is a mortgage already on it. And
that is done, Wasser said, by recording the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recording means that the document is filed with the county
clerk and that it is a matter of public record,'' he said. When a
mortgage is recorded in New York, Wasser said, the original
document is photographed and stored on microfilm. The location of
the document on the microfilm is then recorded in an index to make
it easy to locate the microfilmed image.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, however, is that even after a mortgage is paid in
full _ or ``satisfied'' _ and the original document has been
burned, trashed, filed or lost _ the photographic image on the
microfilm persists.
</P>
<P>
   So what to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to discharge the mortgage of record,'' said John
Hall, a Staten Island lawyer who is past chairman of the real
property section of the New York State Bar Association. What that
means, he said, is that when a mortgage is paid in full, another
document must be filed directing the county clerk to note on the
records that the mortgage has been satisfied. That document is
known as a ``satisfaction of mortgage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Theoretically, the filing of the satisfaction shouldn't be a
problem,'' Hall said, explaining that in New York, lenders are
required to prepare the satisfaction of mortgage and file it with
the county clerk or send it to the borrower if requested.
</P>
<P>
   While that may seem to be a satisfactory way to end the matter,
Hall said, it doesn't always work because people who receive a
satisfaction of mortgage in the mail do not always file it with the
county clerk. And, even more problematic, he said, is the
unfortunate reality that not every lender is aware of New York's
requirement to provide the satisfaction-of-mortgage document.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your mortgage has been sold four or five times, and it's
now owned by a lender in Topeka, Kan., the lender may not do
anything at all after the mortgage is paid,'' Hall said. In fact,
he said, it is becoming increasingly common for lenders to claim
they are unable to locate the original loan documents.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Hall said, homeowners who have paid off their
mortgage should be diligent about making sure they receive from
their lender a satisfaction-of-mortgage form and that the form is
properly filed with the county clerk.
</P>
<P>
   Even in cases where a mortgage is paid off as the result of a
refinancing or sale of the property _ events typically conducted
with the assistance of a lawyer _ the borrower should make sure
that the satisfaction, or release, of mortgage has been filed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never get rid of a file anymore,'' said William Selsberg, a
Stamford, Conn., real-estate lawyer. ``Most lawyers today are
constantly chasing lenders to get them to send in the release after
the mortgage has been paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Selsberg said that homeowners who pay off their mortgage should
contact their lender _ or the institution to which they are
currently sending payments _ to ask for a satisfaction or release
of the mortgage after the last payment has been made. And those who
have sold their property or refinanced their original mortgage
should confirm with the lawyer who handled the sale or refinance
that the original mortgage has been noted on the records as having
been satisfied and released.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should give the lawyer a decent amount of time to get the
release recorded before you start hounding him,'' Selsberg said,
adding that two months should suffice.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Roth, a New Jersey real-estate lawyer, said that when a
mortgage is paid off in New Jersey, the document used to release
the lien on the property can be either the original mortgage itself
or a form known as a ``discharge of mortgage.'' When the original
mortgage is used, Roth said, the lender will indicate somewhere on
the document that the mortgage has been paid in full and may be
``canceled of record.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether a discharge of mortgage or the original mortgage itself
is to be used to release the lien, he said, the document must be
sent to the county clerk _ or registrar, in some counties _ for
recording.
</P>
<P>
   Roth added that in addition to making sure that fully-paid
mortgages are canceled, discharged and/or satisfied of record,
borrowers should also advise the local tax collector and the
homeowner's insurance company to send future bills to the
homeowner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Presumably, the insurance and tax bills were being sent to the
lender,'' he said, explaining that lenders generally insist upon
making such payments while there is a mortgage on a property.
</P>
<P>
   Wasser, the New York real-estate lawyer, said that there was one
other document that borrowers _ or their lawyers _ should insist
upon receiving from the lender: the original promissory note.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you have the satisfaction of mortgage recorded, and you
have the promissory note safely in your hands, you're in good
shape,'' he said. ``And if you still feel you have to burn
something, burn copies.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dry and chilly conditions will return to the Northeast on Sunday
as high pressure builds near Lake Huron and circulates Canadian air
into New England. Brisk winds and a few flurries will begin the day
in the northern Appalachians, but sunshine will dominate along the
North Atlantic coast. Clouds will stream into southern New England
by the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   A disturbance developing over the lower Ohio Valley will spread
a shield of clouds and rain from eastern Missouri to the Middle
Atlantic states. The northern edge of the precipitation should
stretch from near Chicago to Cleveland. Wet snow may develop from
central Pennsylvania to southern New England on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   A wedge of very mild, moist air will occupy the eastern Gulf
states. Drier air pushing east from Texas will trigger several
strong thunderstorms in the South. Florida and the Southeast Coast
will remain bright and quite warm.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific air flowing east from the northern Rockies will
encounter cold air over the northeast Plains. Clouds will thicken
and a little snow may fall near the border. A cold front crossing
the Rockies will be accompanied by gusty showers in the valleys and
heavy wet snow on the west-facing slopes of the mountains. Onshore
winds will reach gale force from northern California to Vancouver
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rain will drench central and northern California with
flooding possible in some sections. High pressure in the Four
Corners region will promote dry and more pleasant conditions for
the desert Southwest. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Feast or Famine  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It has been a real roller coaster pattern of wet and dry across
the Northeast and Middle Atlantic states this past year. So far,
1999 has been quite wet. Since January 1st, Boston has accumulated
more than 7 inches of rain and melted snow while nearby New York
City registered its fifth-wettest January. The moist conditions are
similar to the start of 1998, when New York measured its wettest
first-six-month period of record. In between the two moist periods,
however, the region was very dry, with both New York and Boston
averaging monthly precipitation deficits of between 2 and 3 inches.

MORNING RUSH HITS A SNAG CALLED HISTORY 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By IVER PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARSIPPANY-TROY HILLS , N.J. _ In suburban New Jersey, as in
most auto-dependent societies, a worker's day usually begins in a
car backing out of a driveway. Physical principles being what they
are, there has to be a parking space at the end of that trip.
</P>
<P>
   For Mike Lassell of Lake Hopatcong, that crucial space is at the
Beverwyck Park and Ride here. His daily challenge is to find one in
time to catch the green-and-white Lakeland bus before it pulls out
for the 45-minute trip to Manhattan, where he works as a medical
records analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting here early is the key,'' Lassell said on a chilly
morning last week, ``especially if the weather's bad. If it's
snowing, people dump their cars and jump on the bus, and this place
fills up early.''
</P>
<P>
   But try as he might _ Lassell leaves his house about 6:30 each
morning _ he and his fellow commuters are in one sense hopelessly
late. They had been expecting a roomier parking lot and an easier
start to the day, but their hopes have run up against someone who
got here even earlier than they. Much earlier.
</P>
<P>
   George Washington, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   Because of high demand, the Town of Parsippany-Troy Hills and
the State Department of Transportation decided more than a year ago
to double the number of spaces at the lot to about 400 by expanding
it down the hill it occupies along U.S. Highway 46.
</P>
<P>
   No one was too surprised when the first bites by the backhoes
exposed an early habitation. Road engineers are used to doing
accidental archeology in this old and densely populated state.
Digging for state road 29 south of Trenton, for example, uncovered
the remains of a house that Gen. Washington had ordered burned in
1777 because its owners were Tories. Work on state road 55 in South
Jersey brought up early Indian settlements.
</P>
<P>
   But the ruins at the Beverwyck site turned out to be more than
ordinary: local historians determined that they were the remains of
a manor house, the seat of the 2,000-acre estate of Lucas Von
Beverhoudt, a gentleman farmer and rum importer. It was he who
named the estate Beverwyck.
</P>
<P>
   ``A northern Mount Vernon,'' said John Dourgarian of the State
Department of Transportation. A place Washington and his officers
must have visited. Work stopped for further exploration, and
drivers fumed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's infuriating,'' said Edward Ruhl, a Manhattan banker who
drives in from the farm country near the Pennsylvania line. ``They
tell us to get out of our cars and take public transportation, but
they hold us up on our parking for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Angry commuters wrote to transportation officials demanding that
work resume. Pressured by commuters and local officials, the state
decided last fall to continue with plans for the park-and-ride.
</P>
<P>
   Then archeologists played their trump card: Beverwyck was not
just about Colonial times, they said in public letters and phone
calls to officials and reporters, but about slavery and therefore
race. A 1769 advertisement described the farm's slave holdings, and
shackles were found there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The archeology of this site promises to be of surpassing
interest to those of African descent as well as to scholars in
general,'' R. Alan Mounier, the president of the Archeological
Society of New Jersey, wrote to the State Commissioner of
Transportation in December. The Archeological Conservancy, a
national organization, offered to take over the site.
</P>
<P>
   Public officials decided to start looking for another bus stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got two very valid social issues here: the need to
preserve our history and the need to preserve our environment by
getting people out of their cars and into mass transit,'' said Mimi
Letts, the mayor of Parsippany-Troy Hills. ``And what we have here
are those two very basic issues coming head to head with each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   The state, which owns the land, has not decided who will
administer the site, but it will not become a park-and-ride.

TOMMY KEARNS: THE BEST FIELD GOAL SHOOTING RECORD IN THE NBA
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Kansas, W.Va.) (Eds: Author ID at end of article)  
(DW) 
 By DAVID HALBERSTAM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It began about a year ago as the most casual kind of
palship, one formed in a New York gym. We were working out next to
each other on stationary bicycles. He came over and said that he
understood that I was working on a book on Michael. Michael, of
course, is Michael Jordan. He knew Michael a bit, he volunteered,
because he was a Carolina guy, and had played ball there a very
long time ago. Perhaps he could help with the access. Somehow he
did not look connected to the high-powered modern-day world of
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he looked quite ordinary, just another man in his 60s,
a little shorter than me, perhaps 5 feet 9 inches or 5-10. His
name, he said, was Tommy Kearns, and for a long time the name meant
nothing to me; during most of the ensuing three or four months of
our regular conversations I did not think of him by his name, but
rather as the pleasant, helpful Carolina alumnus from the gym, a
man who was, judging by the sweat on his workout clothes and the
slightly chunky outline of his body, working even harder than I to
keep his weight down.
</P>
<P>
   We both liked to talk basketball. He was smart and likable, and
he clearly knew the inside of the Carolina program extremely well,
who was in and who was out. Dean Smith was Dean to him, yet he
clearly was not a name dropper. After a few weeks during the early
months of the legwork on my book, he began to guide me through the
intricacies of the Carolina hierarchy, and at a time when I was
still struggling to gain access to Smith himself, he tried to be
helpful.
</P>
<P>
   The Carolina basketball world, it should be noted, is tightly
bonded and largely sealed off from the outside world: a cult, Chuck
Daly, the former Penn and Detroit coach once told me, a good cult
instead of a bad one, but a cult nonetheless. Outsiders,
particularly writers, are likely to remain outsiders forever.
Kearns was clearly in the club; he played golf with Smith at
Pinehurst each summer with many of the best-known Carolina alumni,
a kind of Dean Smith Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   Our friendship progressed over the year. We talked about the
game, and about Michael, and Kearns tried, unsuccessfully, to get
me to try spinning, a hyped-up form of stationary bike riding.
Then, late in the season when I was checking out the Carolina
basketball brochure, looking up some of James Worthy's statistics,
I happened to stumble into some of Kearns' records. Tommy Kearns,
it turned out, had been a third-team all-American in the mid-50s,
but even more, he had been the playmaker _ that was before they
were known as point guards _ on the Carolina team that in 1957 had
gone undefeated and beaten Kansas and Wilt Chamberlain for the
national championship I mentioned this to him with apology the next
time we spoke at the gym: ``You really were a player, weren't
you?''
</P>
<P>
   With that he started telling me a very good basketball story
from a very different era. He had been in the vanguard of New York
City kids whom Frank McGuire had recruited back in the mid-50s and
put on his reverse underground railroad to North Carolina, as part
of a plan to bring winning basketball to a school (and region)
which, in basketball terms at least, was largely an underdeveloped
area.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball was not yet a truly national sport and the game was
still more often than not a city game _ played best, it was
believed, in New York. But it was a bad time for the college sport
in New York. The point-fixing scandals of the early 50s had
destroyed the sport locally. Once-powerful programs had been closed
down. McGuire himself had coached at St. John's before seeking a
kind of sanctuary at Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   After landing at Chapel Hill, McGuire started to import his own
boys. He was the son of a New York cop and he was good at
recruiting city boys; if in Carolina he had something of a strange
accent, and if he seemed a little flashy, very much the outlander.
He was very good at visiting kids in their homes, usually
accompanied by someone very successful from the same neighborhood
who vouched for him. He liked to do most of his recruiting in the
homes _ where he could make a better read on the life style and the
ambitions of the parents and therefore tailor his pitch accordingly
_ rather than in fancy restaurants where the parents might be
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   He visited the home of Tommy Kearns, who was a big-time
schoolboy star in New York, some four or five times. In those days
the Catholic high schools held tryouts for scholarships _ the
players the coaches wanted got them, and Kearns had played for Lou
Carnesecca at St. Ann's, a traditional powerhouse; he had been an
all-city playmaking guard, quick, scrappy, and smart with the ball,
with a good outside shot. Under his direction, St. Ann's in 1954,
his senior year, had been national Catholic school champion.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the senior Kearns was also a cop living in the
Bronx did not hurt. It was an easy house in which to make a read.
The recruiting sessions were, Kearns remembered, largely devoted to
McGuire's attempts to overcome the doubts of Kearns' parents about
sending their son to so alien a part of the country. After all,
Chapel Hill was in the heart of the Bible Belt South, and Tom
Kearns Sr. was wary of what would happen to a good Irish Catholic
boy down there.
</P>
<P>
   But, Kearns remembered, McGuire was a masterly recruiter, and if
you listened to him, the conversion was going to be quite different
_ he and his boys were going to convert the Protestants to
Catholicism, and do it through the Trojan horse of basketball. So
in time Kearns became one of four New York City kids McGuire
recruited for his class of 1958, fittingly enough, all of them
Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Already waiting for them down there, a year ahead of them in
school, was a young man of consummate talent who was a great pure
shooter, Lennie Rosenbluth, also a New York boy, who was Jewish.
That would make their team essentially all New York, four Catholics
and a Jew: Kearns; Pete Brennan from St. Augustine's in Brooklyn;
Bobby (no kin to Billy, who came after him) Cunningham, from All
Hallows in the Bronx; Joe Quigg from St. Francis Prep in Brooklyn,
and Rosenbluth from James Monroe in the Bronx. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Their arrival marked the beginning of big-time basketball at
Chapel Hill. They knew the game. They knew how to shoot and set
picks and make cuts and, above all, how to pass. They compensated
for a lack of height by deft defensive positioning. Freshmen could
not play for the varsity in those days, but the Carolina freshmen
were undefeated and often beat the varsity in practice. As
sophomores, they played regularly and went 19-7, and then in their
junior year everything tumbled right and they went 32-0. The heart
of the team, as The Raleigh News and Observer later noted, was
Kearns.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the National Collegiate Athletic Association semifinal, they
beat Michigan State in three overtimes. Then, playing in Kansas
City, Mo., they had to play against a Kansas team led by the
seemingly unstoppable Wilt Chamberlain. They were ranked No. 1 in
the country because they were unbeaten, and Kansas, which had lost
once, was ranked No. 2, but there was no doubt which team was
favored; it was Kansas by about 8 points, playing virtually at home
and led by the mighty Wilt.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, McGuire, wanting to fire his players up and
wanting to end any possibility of intimidation, had turned to
Kearns, the smallest player on his starting team, and said,
``Tommy, you're not afraid to jump center against Wilt, are you?''
and Kearns had shouted out, ``Hell no!'' So he had jumped center,
and Wilt had got the tip, but having Kearns jump center had set a
tone of Tar Heel cockiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife still says that jumping center against Wilt in the
national championship game is the defining moment in my life, the
one sure thing which will be in my obituary,'' Kearns said the
other day.
</P>
<P>
   The message had been given, Carolina was not afraid of Kansas,
and it eventually won, again in triple overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The game, little underdog Carolina against awesome Kansas, had
caught the imagination of the country and the region; from that
time on, noted the writer Jonathan Yardley, who was about to enter
Carolina, basketball became not merely a sport, but a religion in
the area _ in that sense, what McGuire had promised the senior
Kearns proved to be true.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of a great athlete's story _ deeds once so important
to so many people, thousands cheering, but deeds now largely
distant memories for all but those few who actually played, men who
had regained anonymity in their lives _ struck me forcefully as he
finished the story.
</P>
<P>
   He had told this story outside the locker room of our gym and as
we were about to part, he said, almost casually, ``I played in the
NBA, you know.'' He paused and added: ``Briefly. I still hold the
record for the best field-goal percentage. One for one.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he was gone. Not sure whether to believe him or not, I went
home and took out my trusty National Basketball Association record
book, and there it was, a great line: one game, one field goal
attempted, one field goal made.
</P>
<P>
   It was a statistical line for the Walter Mitty in all of us _
and I thought based on that we ought to have lunch so I could hear
the rest of the story, and so we met again. In 1958, when he had
graduated from Chapel Hill, there were only eight teams in the
fledgling NBA _ with 10 players each.
</P>
<P>
   The year that Tommy Kearns came out, the league was just
beginning to change and there was the early surfacing of black
players _ Elgin Baylor went first in the draft that year. Even more
important, Syracuse, which took Kearns in the fourth round, took a
seemingly unknown guard from Marshall named Hal Greer in the third.
Kearns, who had played in a number of all-star games, had never
even heard of Greer. Basketball drafting and scouting hardly was
big time, and Tommy Kearns had never, as far as he knew, been
scouted. It was several weeks after the draft when a letter arrived
from the Syracuse owner, Danny Biasone, setting Kearns' salary at
$7,500 if he made the team. Nothing in those days was guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers, he soon realized at preseason camp, were going to
be tough given the limited 10-man rosters and the need to keep the
payroll down. The veteran guards on the team were Larry Costello,
Al Bianchi and Paul Seymour, then 30 years old and a 12-year
veteran. The question was whether Seymour would be a coach or a
playing coach. If he only coached there was one more spot on the
roster. But Biasone was not a wealthy man _ his money came from the
ownership of bowling alleys, and so all economies were critical.
</P>
<P>
   The competition was tough: the coach himself if he chose to
play; Costello, who was very, very quick; Greer, clearly an
ascending star (``a little bigger, a little quicker and a little
bit better shooter than me''), and Bianchi. Some teammates thought
it was going to come down to a choice between Greer and Kearns, and
that was ominous to Kearns.
</P>
<P>
   Kearns had a good camp, but in one of the last preseason games
he came down off balance from a rebound and hurt his ankle and it
cost him several weeks. When he finally was ready to play, it was
in a game against Cincinnati. Syracuse, as Kearns remembers, was
well ahead in the second half when Seymour sent him in: in time,
the ball had come to him on the outside (``four or five feet
outside the foul circle'') and he had taken his shot and it went
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a 3 in today's game,'' he noted proudly.
</P>
<P>
   All told, he had played seven minutes. The next day Seymour made
his decision. He called Kearns in and said: ``Tommy _ it's been
great. We really like you and your game. But I've decided to stay
on and play, and so we have to let you go.'' That was it.
</P>
<P>
   There were no agents to call European teams in those days; he
was gone that day. Hal Greer, who came in with him, went on to play
for 15 seasons (39,788 regular-season minutes to Kearns' 7),
becoming a Hall of Fame player who averaged 19.2 points a game.
Kearns played for a time in the Eastern League and then went back
and married a girl who had gone to Duke, and worked in Greensboro
for 10 years as an investment banker before returning to New York.
</P>
<P>
   He was, he told me, a man with no regrets: he had got a great
education from a great school, he had helped win a national
championship, and in the record book it still shows that he was the
best shooter ever in the NBA.

 &HT;    Hunting in cyberspace
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An article about the decline in hunting license sales
in the February 1999 issue of Gun World magazine sent tremors
through America's hunting community. It would have done the same
for the hunting industry, but businessmen already had felt the
impact of the loss, nationwide, of some 296,000 hunting license
sales in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The loss supported figures by some who predicted that hunting
would be almost nonexistent in America by the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
   Such a prospect made the industry rumble into motion last year
in a search for the cause of the problem and a solution.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, it turns out, is nebulous. The possible reasons
include the price of the license, hunting access, wildlife
management programs, game populations, hunting regulations,
urbanization and industrialization, weather and even the
installation of a new record-keeping system. They're still trying
to pin it down.
</P>
<P>
   Solutions? Some were introduced at last week's SHOT (Shooting,
Hunting, Outdoor Trade) Show at the Georgia World Congress Center.
</P>
<P>
   The show, sponsored by the National Shooting Sports Foundation,
is billed as the world's premier exposition of firearms,
ammunition, archery, cutlery, outdoor apparel, optics, camping and
related products services.
</P>
<P>
   Some 17,000 buyers from around the world were there to stock up
for next year. What they heard from Buckmasters should be
comforting.
</P>
<P>
   When the 400,000-member deer-hunting organization based in
Montgomery was still in its infancy, founder and CEO Jackie Bushman
said the biggest problem he faced was having some kind of overall
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike waterfowl, turkeys or other game with organizations named
after them, Buckmasters couldn't mount drives to save the deer.
Endangerment isn't a white-tail deer problem.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, Buckmasters did come out with a plan to save an
endangered species: the hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Bushman is putting the fate of the industry in the hands of
children with a cutting edge tool, a hand-held computer game.
</P>
<P>
   Called Buckmasters Deer Huntin, this $25 toy could be a powerful
recruiting instrument for urban kids who can't get into the woods
anytime they want but sure know their way around a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Trading on kids' love of outdoor games, Radica, which produces
Buckmasters Deer Huntin, also produces the best-selling Sport Bass
Fishin, Lunker Bass Fishin and Ultimate Bass Fishin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't get 'em out in the woods, let's bring the woods to
them,'' Bushman said.
</P>
<P>
   Deer Huntin does it, offering a virtual hunting training ground
each time it's played.
</P>
<P>
   In the same news conference, Bushman also announced that GT
Interactive Software will publish a Buckmasters hunting game for
PCs.
</P>
<P>
   GTIS is the company that produces Deer Hunter and Deer Hunter
II. Deer Hunter was the No. 2 seller in the PC games industry, and
the new Deer Hunter II currently leads the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Buckmasters' theory: ``Get 'em interested on the computer, and
some are bound to go do the real thing.''
</P>
<P>
   OUTDOORS GADGETS
</P>
<P>
   Rekindling interest in hunting is just one facet of a show that
requires four days to cover from end to end.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of useful and neat products are on the way. A few
examples are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Genesis knife: Michael Collins introduced the Genesis,
manufactured by Edge Design, Inc. The knife appears to be yet
another tactical folder but in fact is a practical, multipurpose
tool with some thoughtful engineering. The drop-point blade is the
difference. Named Best Buy of the Year at the 1999 Blade Show, the
Genesis retails from $129.99. Info: (314) 863-3343, (770) 428-6870,
http://www.ediknives.com
</P>
<P>
   _ Survival in a Sardine Can: This little package is packed with
pain killers, antibiotics, matches, bouillon, a tea bag,
dehydration tablets, chewing gum, a fish hook and line, a razor
blade, a waterproof bag, a signal mirror, a fire starter cube and
more. Suggested retail: $12. Info: (719) 488-1999.
</P>
<P>
   _ Swiss-Tech ScrewZall: In about three years, Larry Legg's first
invention, the Swiss-Tech Micro Technician has produced about $4
million in sales. Legg keeps on inventing, and his latest product,
the ScrewZall, features a key-ring-sized set of screwdrivers, four
in all (two Phillips, two flatheads), and a key ring to go with it.
Suggested retail: $12.95. Info: (800) 414-8799;
http://www.swisstechtools.com
</P>
<P>
   _ KaDooty: With primitive weapons season about to expand in
Georgia with the probable addition of a black-powder season, the
KaDooty will be popular with archers and muzzle-loader fans. With
muzzle-loaders, it's a ram rod, cleaning rod, super tamper and
bullet extractor. With a bow, it's a fully adjustable bow
stabilizer. Suggested retail: $149. Info: (318) 477-7502,
http://www.kadooty.com
</P>
<P>
   _ La Griffe: The handiest thing knife builder Ernie Emerson had
at the SHOT Show hangs on a string around the neck. Called La
Griffe _ French for claw _ it's about 3 inches long with a
claw-shaped blade. The handle has holes in it for a better grip.
Police types like it for a backup weapon, but the shape and the
secure grip make it a great little tool for field-dressing a deer.
Suggested retail: $69. Info: 310-542-3050,
http://www.emersonknives.com
</P>
<P>
   _ Pocket Chain saw: One of the most effective tools at the show
comes in a can about the size of a can of shoe polish. Inside is a
28-inch length of chain saw with 124 bidirectional teeth, plus two
rings that connect to each end. Put sticks through the rings, put
the saw on some wood and cut away. Suggested retail: $19.95. Info:
(248) 588-1150.

SUSPECT IN EMBASSY ATTACKS IS FORBIDDEN TO CALL MOSQUE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.Y., Texas) (bl) 
By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A new dispute has broken out in the prosecution of
the embassy bombings in Africa over the government's refusal to
allow a defendant to make a phone call to a Muslim leader in
Arlington, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, Wadih el Hage, a naturalized U.S. citizen who had
lived in Arlington, had asked to speak to the imam of a mosque
there in the hope that other members of the congregation would
contribute to his bail.
</P>
<P>
   But a federal prosecutor told Judge Leonard Sand of U.S.
District Court in Manhattan last week that the government ``has
specific concerns'' about the imam, Moataz Al-Hallak, who leads the
Islamic Society of Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors did not elaborate about those concerns in court and
declined comment after the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute comes amid a debate about the restrictive conditions
under which the suspects are being held in New York. El Hage and
his co-defendants are imprisoned in the Metropolitan Correctional
Center under a rarely used rule that allows officials to strictly
limit an inmate's contacts to prevent future ``acts of violence and
terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the provision, officials may segregate inmates and
restrict their mail, visits, phone calls and interviews with the
news media. The government may take the action when it believes
there is substantial risk that an inmate's communications ``could
result in death or serious bodily injury,'' the rule says.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Hallak, who has not previously been mentioned in the case or
been charged with any crime, said the government's concerns were
baseless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what they are talking about,'' Al-Hallak said
when he was reached by phone last week. He said his mosque was
religious and educational, and that he condemned violence. ``We are
just people focusing on a humble mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Hallak said that el Hage was well liked in their community
and that he found the allegations against him difficult to accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``El Hage, as far as we know, is 100 percent innocent,''
Al-Hallak said. ``But if it is proven that he is guilty, we're the
first to condemn this action. But you cannot start dealing with
people as the communist countries used to, that everybody is guilty
until he is proven innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   In court last Tuesday, el Hage's lawyer, Bruce McIntyre, told
Sand that if the phone call was permitted, it would be in English
and that he expected it to be monitored by the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Because prosecutors have refused to specify their concerns, it
is impossible to know precisely what they fear might happen if el
Hage speaks with the imam.
</P>
<P>
   But the language of the rule suggests that they believe el Hage
might try to use Al-Hallak to pass along a coded message.
</P>
<P>
   In court records, prosecutors have asserted that el Hage is
deeply involved in a terrorist organization led by Osama bin Laden,
the Saudi exile suspected of organizing the embassy attacks in
August.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage, whom prosecutors describe as the former personal
secretary to bin Laden, has been indicted on charges that he
conspired with bin Laden to kill Americans abroad, and that he lied
to federal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   In one document, the government accused el Hage of living ``a
life of deception'' and ``acting as a front for a terrorist
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   El Hage has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
</P>
<P>
   One clue to the government's position may lie in the extradition
papers the United States has filed against another suspect in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   That suspect, Khalid al-Fawwaz, has been accused of helping to
disseminate bin Laden's calls for attacks on Americans around the
world. In the extradition papers, the government has included
international phone records that, they say, belong to al-Fawwaz and
show how he spread bin Laden's message around the world. One 1995
call went to the Arlington mosque.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Hallak, who said he has been at the mosque 12 years, said he
had never heard of al-Fawwaz, and did not remember such a call.
``Even if he called our organization, by itself, it doesn't mean
anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In court last week, McIntyre said el Hage wanted to speak with
Al-Hallak merely to assure him that he would return to court if
freed on bail.
</P>
<P>
   But with the government opposing bail on any terms, Sand seemed
disinclined to allow the phone call.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no point in having some broad petition submitted to
members of the congregation of the mosque'' if the exercise is not
going to be meaningful, Sand said. It would ``just raise false
expectations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a typical case,'' he added, ``and the government
has made known its concerns with respect to communications.''
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre said after the court hearing that he planned to move
expeditiously to seek bail for el Hage, even without the phone
call. He contends that el Hage has strong ties to Arlington: he had
worked in a tire shop there, his family still lived there and he
had helped out in the mosque.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's precisely the type of person who should be given bail,''
McIntyre said.

FILLING IN THE BLANKS AT BATTERY PARK CITY
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I get a headache if I don't hear the sound of
piledrivers,'' said James Gill, the chairman of the Battery Park
City Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Hold the aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   So many projects are under way at Battery Park City that the
92-acre landfill along the Hudson River, a once-blank slate on
which politicians and planners have been writing for four decades,
is actually running out of room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going like the hammers of hell,'' Gill said. Two
thousand apartments in eight buildings, a Ritz-Carlton and an
Embassy Suites hotel, an addition to the Museum of Jewish
Heritage-A Living Memorial to the Holocaust and a home for the
Skyscraper Museum, two public schools, four ferry slips and a
15-screen multiplex are newly finished, in construction or being
designed. If Gill had his way, the recently merged National
Association of Securities Dealers and American Stock Exchange would
be in the mix, too.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the current boom involves 10 of the remaining 18
undeveloped parcels. And Gill said he has ``every intention'' of
allocating the rest of the available lots on his watch. ``Battery
Park City sat doing nothing for a long time,'' he said. ``I want to
get as much built as is humanly possible while the market
continues.''
</P>
<P>
   John La Mura, the president and chief executive of the
authority, underscored a ``need to reflect carefully'' on what
comes next. ``If commercial buildings in lower Manhattan are
becoming residential,'' he said, ``where do people recreate? If the
residents who live here say, `We enjoy this ratio of open space,'
with each new apartment building, that ratio diminishes.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she does not always see eye-to-eye with the authority,
Anne Compoccia, the chairwoman of Community Board 1 in lower
Manhattan, agrees that things are advancing quickly at Battery Park
City _ too quickly. ``They should slow down and think about what
they're doing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, growth always induces growing pains, and Battery Park
City is not immune. The loss of open space has meant the eviction
of Cirque du Soleil, which pitched its tent for 10 years on the
landfill. A six-year struggle has yet to be resolved between the
authority and the unit owners in the Hudson View West condominium
over the ground rent and payments in lieu of real-estate taxes. And
the expansion plans at the Holocaust memorial have been postponed
for the moment by a dispute over financing between Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   There is also much tension between Gill and La Mura, both
appointees of Pataki, although they insist it has not hampered
significant decisions.
</P>
<P>
   More substantively, the authority is torn between its fiduciary
responsibility to get top dollar for development sites, its
municipal responsibility to make Battery Park City a lively
citywide attraction and its social responsibility to insure that
neighborhoods are diverse and desirable.
</P>
<P>
   A tug-of-war between the community and the authority over an
``interim'' ballfield, for example, was only partly resolved by the
authority's assurance that the field will be made permanent. The
question now is what happens to the development potential _ 870,000
square feet, roughly 870 apartments _ represented by the baseball
diamonds, tennis and basketball courts. Gill said the total value
of the land if fully developed would be $100 million. Were the
authority to forgo that revenue, he said, it would amount to ``the
most expensive Little League field in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   What the authority will do instead is shift most of the unused
development rights _ perhaps 700,000 square feet _ to other parcels
in the north neighborhood, which will yield larger buildings on
those sites than were called for in the master plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more we develop,'' Gill said, ``the more revenue we
generate.''
</P>
<P>
   The authority estimates it will turn over $44 million to New
York City this year, after operating expenses of $21 million and
debt service of $65 million on $1 billion in bonds. Total revenues
are $131 million, of which $119 million comes from ground rents and
payments in lieu of real estate taxes. The authority owns the land
and leases it to developers until the year 2069.
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter of the operating budget goes to maintain the
generously landscaped parkland, which is the prime attraction of
Battery Park City to many New Yorkers _ and a lure for development.
``I look at it as leveraged money,'' said Robert Serpico, the
authority's chief financial officer. ``You're spending money to
make money.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty percent of the space at Battery Park City was set aside
for parks, plazas and esplanades under the 1979 master plan by the
architects Alexander Cooper and Stanton Eckstut, during the
chairmanship of Richard Kahan. The plan called for 14,000 housing
units (4,550 have been built and 2,000 are in the pipeline) and 6
million square feet of commercial space, a goal that was met by the
World Financial Center and exceeded with the construction two years
ago of the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The original plan of 1969 envisioned a population of 50,000 _
two-thirds of them middle- and low-income families _ and employment
for 35,000.
</P>
<P>
   Today, some 40,000 people work in the World Financial Center,
including the Mercantile Exchange and its Commodity Exchange
division. About 8,000 people live in Battery Park City, but it is a
far less diverse population than was envisioned. ``We've got too
many yuppies,'' Gill said. ``I mean, we like yuppies. But enough
already.''
</P>

   ``I don't want Battery Park City to be an elitist community,''
he said. ``I don't think that's healthy for any community.''

   To broaden the age mix, the authority has awarded a development
site in the north neighborhood to Brookdale Living Communities of
Chicago, a national builder of high-end, independent-living
quarters for the elderly. Its 14-story, 220-unit building, the
Hallmark, was designed by Lucien Lagrange and Schuman Lichtenstein
Claman Efron. The $50 million project is to open next year.
</P>
<P>
   Residents will have to be at least 62 years old. Fees are to run
from $3,400 a month for a studio apartment to $8,500 for a
two-bedroom unit with a den, which is to include daily breakfasts
and 20 dinners, housekeeping and linen service, some utilities, a
health clinic in the building and other features.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the amenities that Battery Park City has to offer as it
gets built up, it's a great place to retire and grow old,'' said
Mark Schulte, president and chief executive of Brookdale.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the authority is encouraging more families
with children to settle in Battery Park City through the
construction of larger apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started to develop the north, we put an emphasis on
family-sized apartments,'' said Enid Feist, vice president for
policy and operations at the authority.
</P>
<P>
   In Tribeca Bridge Tower, which the authority developed itself
and now plans to sell, there are no studio apartments and only 21
one-bedroom units. But there are 128 two- and three-bedroom units.
Depending on size and location, a three-bedroom apartment rents for
$4,500 to $6,000 a month. The authority set aside 30 apartments for
families who cannot afford those rents but earn too much to qualify
for the ``80-20'' program. The architects were Costas Kondylis,
John R. Menz &AMP; Richard Cook and Pasanella &AMP; Klein Stolzman &AMP; Berg.
</P>
<P>
   At the base of the tower is Public School-Intermediate School
89, with room for 850 students, which opened in September. ``If you
live in our building, you can send your kid down the hall to
school,'' Gill said. ``If the kid is smart enough when he gets to
high school level, he can go to Stuyvesant'' _ right across
Chambers Street.
</P>
<P>
   Another step toward economic integration is ``80-20'' housing,
in which 80 percent of the apartments are rented at market rates
and 20 percent are subsidized and made available to those earning
50 percent or less of the median income for New York City. In
return, developers obtain real-estate tax abatements and
lower-interest financing through tax-exempt bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Compoccia said that was far from a panacea. ``I'm
middle-class,'' she said. ``For argument's sake, give me the
opportunity to live in a place like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Four new buildings at Battery Park City are in the ``80-20''
program:
</P>
<P>
   _ River Watch, a 9-story building with 209 units, developed by
the Brodsky Organization and designed by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer
Associates and Schuman Lichtenstein. Occupancy is expected in June.
</P>
<P>
   _ A 9-story building (yet to be named) with 208 units, developed
by the DeMatteis Organization and designed by the same team as
River Walk. Occupancy is expected late this year or early in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tribeca Park, a 27-story building with 395 units, developed by
the Related Companies and designed by Robert A.M. Stern and
Kondylis. It is to open in May.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tribeca Pointe, a 43-story tower with 340 units, by Rockrose
Development Corp. Tenants have begun moving in.
</P>
<P>
   Tribeca Pointe dramatically illustrates the impact of the
``80-20'' program. Two-bedroom apartments rent on the market for
$3,285 to $4,760 a month. But a family of four with a total annual
income between $19,090 and $25,100 could have qualified for a
two-bedroom apartment at $525 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's truly like winning the lottery,'' said Kevin Singleton,
vice president and general manager of Rockrose Development. Chance
does figure into it, since priority is determined by numbers
assigned to the applications as they are randomly pulled from mail
bags. There were more than 3,000 applicants for 70 apartments at
Tribeca Pointe, said Sofia Estevez of Rockrose.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Rockrose was designated the developer of a site at
21 River Terrace in the north end. Designed by Gruzen Samton, the
27-story building will have 300 to 330 units. None will be
subsidized. And Rockrose will pay the equivalent of full
real-estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   A significant footnote at 21 River Terrace is that one of the
bidders was Avalon Bay Communities, a real-estate investment trust
based in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing that has changed recently is that
national real estate companies are responding to the authority's
RFPs,'' said Jon McMillan, vice president of the Landmark America
development concern in Portland, Maine, and former planning
director at Battery Park City.
</P>
<P>
   Other national companies arriving at Battery Park City include
Promus Hotel Corp. of Memphis, Tenn., which is allied with Forest
City Ratner Companies in the construction of a $163 million,
14-story mixed-use project on Vesey Street, which is to be
completed in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Bisected by a 140-foot-high, art-filled public atrium, the
building will contain a 4,000-seat multiplex operated by Regal
Cinemas of Knoxville, Tenn., which calls itself the largest motion
picture exhibitor in the world; a 463-room Embassy Suites Hotel and
a New York Sports Club. The architects are Perkins Eastman, with
interiors designed by Alexandra Champalimaud.
</P>
<P>
   The next hotel at Battery Park City, opening in 2001, is to be a
250-room Ritz-Carlton, which will occupy the lower floors of a
38-story tower planned by Millennium Partners on the southernmost
parcel. The deluxe hotel chain, based in Atlanta, has not been in
New York for two years.
</P>
<P>
   The $175 million project includes a permanent, rent-free home
for the Skyscraper Museum, which has wandered from space to space
since its founding three years ago. On the 14th floor will be a
restaurant with an outdoor terrace overlooking the harbor. Above
that will be 150 condominiums. The architects are Gary Edward
Handel &AMP; Associates and the Polshek Partnership.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In designing the tower, the architects attempted to move beyond
the existing esthetic in the residential neighborhoods, where
guidelines carefully specify traditional-looking brick and masonry
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   While the north side of the Ritz-Carlton Downtown will hew to
that, the south and west facades will have a 35-story curtain wall
of glass, representing a ``more progressive esthetic,'' said Todd
Schliemann, a partner in the Polshek firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lighthouse'' was a word used both by Schliemann and by Scott
Keller, a partner in Gruzen Samton, which designed Tribeca Pointe
at the opposite end of Battery Park City, also with a broad expanse
of glass in its upper floors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a beacon for the whole of Battery Park City,''
Keller said. ``As such, it should reflect not only the residential
buildings but the office buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   With the two critical end sites accounted for, the authority is
focusing on a huge parcel in the middle, Site 26, north of the
World Financial Center. Officials estimate it could accommodate 1.4
million square feet of commercial development. It was in play last
year as a possible site for the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   World Financial Properties, the successor to Olympia &AMP; York,
which owns and manages the World Financial Center, has proposed
building a new home for the National Association of Securities
Dealers and American Stock Exchange on Site 26.
</P>
<P>
   NASD chief administrative officer Michael Jones said last week
that Battery Park City ``certainly could be'' a site but that no
decision had been made yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to see Nasdaq-Amex decide to stay downtown,'' said
Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York.
``And certainly one of the most attractive sites downtown is
Battery Park City.''
</P>
<P>
   New York Mercantile Exchange chairman Daniel Rappaport believes
it might be especially fruitful if Nasdaq and Amex were only a
block away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having them as neighbors would lead us perhaps to becoming
more involved in joint ventures.'' Rappaport said.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange is one of the most surprising features of Battery
Park City, in that nothing about its restrained, gray-flannel
facade betrays the sheer pandemonium within, where two
25,000-square-foot trading floors seethe with hundreds of brokers
and traders swarming around circular pits.
</P>
<P>
   Clad in the eye-popping colors of a medieval pageant, shouting
and gesturing wildly, they buy and sell futures and options in
crude oil, heating oil, gasoline, natural gas, platinum, copper,
silver and gold.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Shearman, a natural gas trader, said he liked the extra
room in the ring, better places to eat and a gym in the building.
But the biggest change in his routine since the exchange moved from
the World Trade Center is that he commutes by ferry. ``It's a nice
little ride across the river,'' he said, ``and I'm right at the
building.''
</P>
<P>
   Shearman is in good company. About 13,000 passengers a day use
the small, floating ferry terminal. The Port Authority of New York
and New Jersey is planning a permanent new one, doubling its
capacity to four slips. The $24 million project is to open in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Crossing West Street to Battery Park City sometimes seems like
more of a challenge than crossing the Hudson, especially for
children, the elderly or disabled. There are three pedestrian
bridges over the roadway but the elevators are not yet working at
the bridge that joins the north end to Tribeca. The authority is
considering a fourth bridge, around Morris Street, La Mura said, as
a link the burgeoning south neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   With the perspective of 20 years and 20-20 hindsight, Eckstut
said one problem with the 1979 plan was the necessary assumption
that the Westway highway would be built along the Hudson River,
affecting the orientation of Battery Park City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The project essentially turns its back to the city,'' said
Eckstut, now a principal in Ehrenkrantz, Eckstut &AMP; Kuhn. While he
sees things in need of ``tweaking'' _ the listless retail space in
the World Financial Center, the lack of meaningful waterfront
activity _ Eckstut sounded generally satisfied with the plan as it
evolved. ``It really feels and looks like New York, which was our
goal,'' Eckstut said. Where development has veered from the plan,
he finds it is usually positive. For instance, he said, ``There's a
whole emerging cultural district that we never anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   That district is anchored by the Museum of Jewish Heritage and
Holocaust memorial, completed in 1997 to designs by Kevin Roche,
with interiors by Patrick Gallagher.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is planning a $44 million east wing, containing an
auditorium, galleries and viewing rooms for the archives of Steven
Spielberg's Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation. Roche
and Gallagher would collaborate again.
</P>
<P>
   New York museums are typically knit to the surrounding urban
fabric but a visit to the Museum of Jewish Heritage helps dispel
the sense of incongruity in its isolated location at Manhattan's
tip.
</P>
<P>
   After circling the windowless first-floor galleries on Jewish
life a century ago, then the windowless second-floor galleries on
the Holocaust, a visitor arrives at a hexagonal rotunda on the
third floor, with a tall glass case enclosing a Torah scroll that
was to have been exhibited in a museum of the ``extinct Jewish
race'' in Prague.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that case is a row of windows. And out the windows are
Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty.

CITY COUNCIL SUPPORTS FURTHER OVERSIGHT OF LOS ANGELES POLICE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (jw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The City Council has moved to strengthen civilian
oversight of the Los Angeles Police Department despite opposition
from the police chief.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the council voted, 11-0, with four members absent, to
support an ordinance that would shield the identity of
whistle-blowers in the department and protect them from retaliation
for bringing accusations of wrongdoing to the attention of the
inspector general, who is now Deirdre Hill. The post is a civilian
position, created after the police beating of Rodney King and the
ensuing riots to give the public greater oversight of the
department.
</P>
<P>
   The measures in the ordinance, requiring a final vote on
Tuesday, are to a great extent already contained in the city's
civil service codes and in federal employment law, said
Councilwoman Laura Chick, the author of the ordinance. She said the
law was needed to show that the city was serious about police
oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sends a very strong message to the public, the Police
Department and the commission: that we intend to persevere in
ensuring the integrity and the responsibilities of the inspector
general,'' Ms. Chick said.
</P>
<P>
   The whistle-blower ordinance grew out of an incident last year,
in which Sgt. Jace Kessler sent a complaint to the inspector
general concerning remarks made by Chief Bernard Parks about police
union officials. (He called them ``tired old men.'') The complaint
letter was read by the Police Commission's executive director,
Joseph Gunn, and turned over to Parks.
</P>
<P>
   To protect officers from retaliation, Councilman Mark
Ridley-Thomas requested an investigation of the handling of the
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The department's first inspector general, Katherine Mader,
resigned last fall after less than three years in the job, saying
that her civilian bosses on the Police Commission were undercutting
her authority. Since her resignation, officials have engaged in a
highly public debate over the scope and power of the inspector
general position.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the Police Department has had a high degree of
independence from City Hall, the result of measures passed in the
1930s to insulate the department from any corrupt elected
officials. But the department has come under public pressure in
recent months from officials who want to ensure that the police are
responsive to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The council has backed other measures intended to strengthen the
hand of the inspector general, including broad authority to
initiate investigations and release reports to the public without
substantial changes; unrestricted access by the inspector general
to department documents, and requirements that Police Commission
decisions to cut off investigations be made public.
</P>
<P>
   But a report by the city attorney's office last month said the
council did not have the authority to enact most of the other
measures. As a result, they are expected to be included in a
referendum scheduled for a vote in June to overhaul the city's
charter.
</P>
<P>
   The measures have been opposed by Parks, himself a strict
disciplinarian who dismissed 54 officers last year, a record for
the city.
</P>
<P>
   In letters to the City Council, Parks said the reform proposals
gave the inspector general too much power and were a potential
hindrance to effective law enforcement.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Changes which allow duplicate investigations, officers to hide
behind confidentiality even though they are sworn to come forward
with the truth, and a position accountable to no one until after
the damage is done will surely and inevitably deny the people of
this city the peace and safety they deserve,'' Parks wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chick said the department must have oversight beyond its own
internal checks and balances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw what happened in this city when the department is
scrutinizing itself,'' she said. ``We have the history to remind
us.''

FROM SKATING ON THE ICE TO LOGGING ON TO THE WEB
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``This space is going to scream `new media,' '' said
Kevin O'Connor, the chairman and chief executive of Doubleclick
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The space he was referring to was the 16th floor of the building
at 450 W. 33rd St. at 10th Avenue. For years it was better known as
Sky Rink, one of the few places in midtown where skaters and ice
hockey players could practice their skills. (The rink has since
moved to Chelsea Piers.)
</P>
<P>
   Now the 50,000-square-foot, column-free space is to be converted
into the headquarters of Doubleclick, a company that acts as a
broker for advertising on the World Wide Web and measures the
efficiency of the ads. The company is one of the fastest growing of
the computer-based communications companies in the city's so-called
Silicon Alley, hiring on average of a person a day during the last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also leasing 100,000 square feet on the 12th
floor of the 33rd Street building so it can consolidate all its
operations under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   Doubleclick is the first company of its kind to secure economic
incentives from New York City and state to expand its operations
locally, rather than keep a headquarters in the city and shift
other office-jobs to other locations. The company will receive a
total of $5.1 million if it stays in place and meets job growth
targets.
</P>
<P>
   Rents in the building, which is owned by the John Hancock
insurance company, have recently ranged from the low to mid-20s per
square foot annually.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being long and wide, the 16th floor space has
volume, with 26 feet between the floor and the bottom of the steel
trusses that support the roof. According to Frederic M. Strauss, an
architect with the Phillips Group, this layout permits the
construction of mezzanines totaling about 11,000 square feet under
city zoning rules.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than place the mezzanine around the periphery of the
space, as is most common, Strauss has proposed building
two-story-high structures within the confines of the former ice
rink space. The two-story enclosed structures would be used largely
as meeting rooms and would stand out against the backdrop of
low-level cubicles that would probably occupy the rest of the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   To further add dramatic impact to the space, the mezzanine-level
rooms would be linked by a second-level catwalk stretching
diagonally almost completely across the rink space.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the interior space, the 16th floor also includes
two sizable deck areas totaling about 20,000 square feet, in the
front overlooking 10th Avenue and in the back facing the General
Post Office building. Those decks would be used to provide
amenities like a basketball court, a running track and a shaded
dining area to the mostly young staff members, who are expected to
work long hours. (A rock climbing wall has also been discussed, but
does not appear on current renderings of the project.)
</P>
<P>
   ``People spend so much time at work that you need a place where
people want to be,'' O'Connor said. He said the market for
technically qualified employees was so competitive in New York that
pleasant working conditions were an important consideration for
young people deciding on which of several job offers to accept.
</P>
<P>
   Other new-media companies have equipped their work spaces with
exercise rooms, pool tables and pingpong tables.
</P>
<P>
   A little over three years ago Doubleclick was two people,
O'Connor and his co-founder, Dwight Merriman, working in a basement
in Atlanta trying to cook up an Internet-based business. Today the
company has 500 employees worldwide (375 in New York), operates in
a dozen countries and is publicly traded, having sold an initial
public offering in February 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The company's first 3.5 million shares were offered at $17 a
share, but jumped to $26.75 at the close of the first day of
trading. The stock has been extremely volatile since then, trading
as low as $13.50 and as high as $114.62 and recently has been
trading at about $100 a share.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The company name derives from the two quick strokes of a button
on a computer's mouse control needed to make changes on a screen.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said the company had the choice of relocating to the
West Coast, famously the home of technology-based start-up
companies, or New York. ``We decided to come to New York because
New York is the advertising capital of the country and this is
where our customers are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Having a base of operations in New York was also a help in the
company's international expansion. ``Being from New York gives you
a lot of credibility overseas,'' he said. ``The attitude is that
anyone who can build a business in New York is real.''
</P>
<P>
   This rapid growth has helped keep the company on the forefront
of technical development but has presented practical difficulties.
``My biggest challenge has been real estate,'' O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   Doubleclick people now are spread over six different floors of
two buildings, one at 41 Madison Ave., at 26th Street, the other at
245 Fifth Ave., at 28th Street. ``Sky Rink gets us together
again,'' he said, using the old name of the 16th floor as shorthand
for both floors in the 33rd Street building.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to find that attractive, but he said that without the
financial incentives, the company might have looked elsewhere. ``We
would have always kept a core sales group in New York, but there
are a lot of people in the back office and engineering who do not
have to be there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal with the city's Economic Development Corp.,
Doubleclick gets $1 million to keep its operations in the city and
will get $3 million more if the number of jobs in the city grows to
756. The Empire State Development Corp. contributed $900,000.
</P>
<P>
   Doubleclick officials said the space being rented on 33rd Street
could accommodate as many as 1,000 people, giving some indication
of their expectations for growth.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Millard, president of the EDC, said the city had
targeted new media as an engine for economic growth. ``The Giuliani
administration is committed to the growth of Silicon Alley,'' he
said, using another term for the concentration of computer-based
companies in Manhattan. ``And we want to send a message to the rest
of the country that New York is behind this industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Developing the industry locally while it is in its infancy is
important, he said, because of the jobs it is likely to generate as
it grows. To the extent that new-media companies prosper in New
York, they will help moderate the influence of financial services
firms that now dominate the economy and extract huge incentives
from the city by threatening to move.
</P>
<P>
   The Web is the first new type of media to be introduced since
the widespread distribution of television half a century ago,
according to Wenda Harris Millard, executive vice president for
marketing and sales at Doubleclick and no relation to the EDC
president. ``Cable was not really a new medium,'' she added. ``It
was just a different means of distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Doubleclick executives first looked at the space on 33rd Street
last summer, but it took until just last month to conclude a deal,
in part because the company's requirements kept changing. ``This is
the only deal I've ever been involved in where the amount of space
tripled during the negotiation,'' said Scott Schneider, a lawyer
with Loeb &AMP; Loeb who advised on the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the nature of its business, Doubleclick operates
around the clock and on all days of the week _ in industry
parlance, ``24/7.'' As a result it arranged for exclusive use of
two ground-floor loading bays and two freight elevators in the
onetime warehouse building to move equipment in and out as needed.
</P>
<P>
   Because it once housed a major bank's computer center it is well
equipped with electrical power and telecommunications equipment,
brokers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed space like this,'' O'Connor said. ``The buildings we
are in now close at 6 p.m.''
</P>
<P>
   With the 10-year agreements now signed, Strauss said he would go
into more detailed design than was possible when it was not clear
exactly what would be included in the lease. Doubleclick officials
said they hoped to move into the building in November.
</P>
<P>
   The massive 1.6 million-square-foot building, which occupies two
blocks along 10th Avenue, is also home to WNET, the public
television station better known as Channel 13, and The Daily News.

<P>
   SAVANNAH, Ga. _ In 17 years of working in Chevron's finance
department, Robert Cunningham never thought he was preparing for a
career as an innkeeper. But this city of grand homes and leafy
squares changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, he and his wife, Judy, moved here from
Rowayton, Conn., settling into a four-story Georgian town house
built in 1856 by one of that era's most prominent lawyers. They
bought it for $1 million, but it needed little renovation. It is
now the Jesse Mount Inn, named for the lawyer who built it.

   The Cunninghams are part of a wave of newcomers to this city,
which has seen a sharp upturn in its downtown recently. Not too
many years ago, many grand homes stood nearly ruined by neglect as
their owners abandoned the downtown. Large commercial and
industrial buildings were empty as well.
</P>
<P>
   But Savannah has benefited from a most unusual redevelopment
tool _ a private arts college that has invested $30 million over
two decades buying and repairing 52 downtown buildings for its own
use.
</P>
<P>
   This, in turn, renewed interest in renovating hundreds of
residences in the Savannah Historic Landmark District, raising
property values by at least 15 percent, said Cora Bett Thomas, a
real estate broker who specializes in selling homes in the district
_ at 2.2 square miles the largest in the nation. Some homes have
doubled in value, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school saved this community, you cannot overstate that,''
said Ms. Thomas. ``In the 1980s we thought this city _ the historic
district _ wouldn't survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Savannah, 10 miles up the Savannah River from the Atlantic, was
Georgia's first city. Established in 1733 by a young member of
Parliament, James E. Oglethorpe, it was to have been an
experimental village, where England's poor would make silk and
other products. But the silk factory burned, destroying the
cocoons, and its 10 acres of grains and fruit froze after five
frigid winters.
</P>
<P>
   But Oglethorpe had fashioned a brilliant urban design, with
small neighborhoods surrounding 24 squares. All but three remain,
flourishing with towering live oaks and burgeoning azaleas. Rich
cotton planters _ their fortunes secure thanks to the cotton gin,
invented by Eli Whitney, who had come to Savannah from Yale to
teach on a cotton plantation _ built many of the ornate homes
encircling the squares.
</P>
<P>
   One such house, beside Madison Square, served as the
headquarters of Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman, who ended his march
to the sea here near the close of the Civil War, sparing Savannah
but burning down dozens of other cities in Georgia and South
Carolina. He telegraphed President Abraham Lincoln from Green
Meldrim House, now a museum, telling him that he was giving him
Savannah as a Christmas present.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1950s, downtown shops, offices and the grand homes were
vacant as whites moved to the city's outskirts. Residents got a
wake-up call in 1954 when the city market and adjacent Ellis Square
were demolished for a city-owned parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, the Davenport House, a Federal-style house built
in 1820 on Columbia Square, was to be razed for a funeral home
parking lot. But seven women raised $22,500 overnight to buy the
house, saving it from demolition. Later that year, they formed the
Historic Savannah Foundation. In 1966, the historic district was
designated.
</P>
<P>
   City officials say some 1,200 buildings have been restored
since, many of them because the Savannah College of Art and Design
renovated a commercial building next door.
</P>
<P>
   The college began in 1979 as a dream of Richard and Paula Rowan,
who had worked in a number of jobs in education in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Rowan, the college president, said he and his wife had selected
the city simply because ``it is architecturally rich, and it is
beautiful.'' Ms. Rowan is the provost and has been responsible for
the design and planning of the renovations.
</P>
<P>
   The first building the college purchased was the Savannah
Volunteer Guards Armory. Built in 1892 in the Romanesque Revival
style, the 36,000-square-foot building was converted into
classrooms and the first administrative offices. Before the school
opened, the teachers painted the interior of the building, which
now houses the graphic design department and production laboratory.
That first year, 71 students enrolled. This year, some 4,500 attend
the college, which offers a wide variety of undergraduate and
graduate degrees in art, theater, film and architecture.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the college bought vacant buildings in the historic
district. Often they were structures no one could imagine a use
for. One, the Chatham County Jail, cost it nothing. A group of
Eastern Airline pilots had bought it, but after a series of
scuttled plans they offered it to the college without charge. Now
it houses offices and the cellblock will be converted into a
fitness center within a year.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, the former Hamilton Electric building, on the
riverfront, purchased for $176,240 and renovated at a cost of $2.1
million, has been transformed into Hamilton Hall, a space for
shooting movies and commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can drive a car over it on the second floor because of the
huge pilings underneath,'' Rowan said. His own office is in what
once was the studio and offices WTOC, the CBS-TV affiliate here.
SCAD-TV, the college station, broadcasts from there now. Its
50-foot tower provides income from leases with mobile phone
companies and television stations.
</P>
<P>
   An old movie theater was bought for $205,000. The college spent
$1 million converting it for live theater as well as movies. It
opened four months ago with a show by Tony Bennett, the singer, who
also painted a picture for the college to auction.
</P>
<P>
   Because of all the construction, the college maintains its own
design team and construction arm. Soon to be finished is the
college's new library in what used to be Levy's Department Store.
The building and $850,000 was given to the school by Federated
Department Stores.
</P>
<P>
   But the college has not been without its detractors. In 1993,
former faculty members accused the college administration of
operating a for-profit business with a nonprofit tax exemption and
lying about admissions statistics. The college sued the former
employees for attempting to take over the school and they
countersued. All the lawsuits were settled three years later; the
agreements were not made public.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent inquiries from accrediting agencies found in favor of
the school. Last week, the Chatham County Superior Court ruled that
the school was entitled to claim tax exemptions for two diners it
operates. A former tax assessor had argued the diners were
for-profit businesses.

<P>
   Ms. Thomas, the real estate broker, said tourism here has
benefited greatly from ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,''
the book by John Berendt, later the basis for a movie, based on the
murder trial of Jim Williams, a wealthy local antiques dealer who
eventually was acquitted of shooting to death his companion in one
of the Historic District's grandest homes.
</P>
<P>
   But the college, she said, has brought permanent residents.
Faculty and staff members, now numbering more than 700, have bought
homes as have the parents of students. Some parents have moved to
the area permanently, Ms. Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   A house used in the movie across from the Cunninghams' inn
recently sold for its listed price of $498,000 the first day it was
on the market. An Atlanta developer plans a complete renovation of
the 3,800-square-foot clapboard Greek Revival house as a residence.
The Koger house on the opposite side of the historic district
recently sold for $3.25 million to the Panoz family, owners of
Chateau Elan, a resort in north Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Their daughter, Donna Sparks, paid $2.1 million for a
10,000-square-foot home nearby and converted it into an inn. Known
as Granite Steps, the house was formerly owned by Williams, the
murder defendant, and was featured in the movie as well. She and
her husband, Randall, live in the inn's garden-level apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The Cunninghams have been happy running their inn, but have
decided for the sake of their family life to sell. Innkeeping is a
time-intensive business, Cunningham said. They have listed the inn
with Ms. Thomas at an asking price of $1.5 million. And they have
told her that they plan to buy a smaller house in the historic
district.

THE REACTION: Intently Watching a Show That No One Wanted to See 
 (See also IMPEACH, IMPEACH-WITNESSES, IMPEACH-TEXT, (bl) 
By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Looking up from her morning exertions on a stationary
bicycle, Rena Kahn gave the famous young woman on the television
screen a cool, but not unsympathetic, appraisal.
</P>
<P>
   ``She seems like she's really in control, like they prepped her
really well,'' said Ms. Kahn, nodding toward the videotaped image
of Monica Lewinsky playing on the set hanging above her exercise
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Then she gave another look. ``But whoever does her hair, well, I
don't know,'' added Ms. Kahn, with the briefest shake of her head.
``And the poor thing has really ballooned up.''
</P>
<P>
   The television debut of Ms. Lewinsky _ talking, smiling, biting
her lip and sometimes pausing with a contemplative glance skyward
as she pondered questions from the House impeachment managers _
elicited some compassion but only fleeting interest Saturday in the
``cardio room'' of the Synergy Fitness Club in midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate trial, instead of the customary sports programming,
was displayed on every television in the room, at a reporter's
request, but Ms. Lewinsky was barely audible over the sound of
pounding feet and labored breathing.
</P>
<P>
   But seeing was the thing, because few people had caught sight of
the former White House intern over the last year except as a frozen
image in a newspaper photograph, a fast-moving figure ducking into
a limousine or caught, in an often-replayed moment, wearing a
jaunty black beret and reaching up to give President Clinton a hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very sad, in a way, that we're seeing this,'' said Ms.
Kahn, the director of international business at Deloitte &AMP; Touche,
as she watched a snippet of Ms. Lewinsky's testimony. ``We already
know all the details.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the health club patrons stared out the wall of windows
onto Park Avenue or pointedly ignored the televisions as they read
books or lost themselves in the music of their portable
audiocassette players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather watch something else,'' conceded Charles Wimer,
a lawyer and regional manager of a title company, as he jogged
earnestly on a treadmill. But he watched the trial anyway,
expressing surprise at Ms. Lewinsky's appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought she'd look better,'' he said. ``For a young kid, she
doesn't look good to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Wimer said he feels some sympathy for the young woman. ``I
always thought, from the accounts I read, that this was not an
innocent kid,'' he said. ``But the fact is, he's powerful and she's
the one who has to stand up and testify while he stays in the White
House and has his cronies cover for him.''
</P>
<P>
   While he did not expect to be watching the impeachment trial
while exercising at Synergy, Wimer said he would happily watch Ms.
Lewinsky telling her story in her own words in a less formal
setting. ``That, everybody will watch,'' he said. ``Everybody is
anxious to hear what she has to say without being in a judicial
atmosphere, when she's a lot more relaxed and not under
cross-examination.''
</P>
<P>
   As he built up speed on his stationary bicycle, Michael Prince,
34, a reporter for Business Insurance magazine, watched Ms.
Lewinsky parry a few questions from her congressional
interrogators. He said she impressed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see some life in her, a little snappy something,'' he
said, adding that she was ``not a ditzy Californian as many people
have made her out to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Durando, a publishing company executive who was
maintaining a punishing pace on his treadmill, below a row of
televisions, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She looks better than she first did when she became a public
figure,'' he said. ``She's had a little help with her personal
look. The hair's still big, but it's under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the room, Rona Siegel kept her eyes on the screen as she
pushed and pulled and strained on a cross-training machine. Ms.
Siegel was once an agent for fashion models and evaluated Ms.
Lewinsky's appearance, and imagined her inner life, with a
professional's dispassionate cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica looks good,'' she said. ``She puts herself together
well, but what she did was unrealistic. How many 50-year-old men
are going to leave success and power and go off with a
24-year-old?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Siegel, who now owns Tatoo Fotography Management in
Manhattan, said she also found Ms. Lewinsky ``very composed'' in
the witness chair. ``By now she's been interviewed 25 times, so
after awhile it doesn't intimidate you anymore,'' she observed.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Siegel, with her experience handling teen-age girls and
models no older than Ms. Lewinsky was when she met the president,
also said she was not fooled by composure, a mature wardrobe and a
well-coifed head.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that age, you're young emotionally,'' she added. ``I used
to send 15- and 16-year-old girls around the world. They think they
know what they're doing, but they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   A young woman pounding away on a treadmill, who said her name
was Lauren but refused to give her last name, took a different
tack. Ms. Lewinsky's black suit and string of pearls were pretty,
she said, though her circumstances were not.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's just a girl who fell in love with her boss,'' Lauren
said, resolutely running in place. ``He just happens to be the most
powerful man in the world.''

 &HT;    Gaither Award to Basnight
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ North Carolina A&AMP;T running back Mike Basnight received
the Jake Gaither Award on Saturday during the 100 Percent Wrong
Club's annual awards banquet at the Hyatt Regency in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The award, named for the legendary former Florida A&AMP;M football
coach, is presented annually to the top player from a historically
black college. Basnight, a 6-foot-2, 230-pound running back,
injured a knee midway through the season and played in only eight
games, but rushed for 943 yards and finished his career with 2,544.
</P>
<P>
   Basnight was the most valuable player in the Blue-Gray All-Star
Classic, leading the Gray team in rushing with 74 yards and scoring
a pair of touchdowns. North Carolina A&AMP;T coach Bill Hayes is
convinced that Basnight has a future in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got it all _ size, speed ... just an outstanding young
man,'' Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a team player who really wants to excel. We don't know
how fast he is because he seems to be just a step in front of the
guy trying to tackle him. He's got what you call `competitive
speed.''' Basnight was chosen as the Gaither Award recipient over
eight other candidates: Florida A&AMP;M quarterback Pat Bonner, Morris
Brown wide receiver Brelon Jones, Jackson State wide receiver
Sylvester Morris, Mississippi Valley State linebacker Terry Houzah,
South Carolina State safety Jermaine Derricott, Savannah State
cornerback Reggie Jackson, Virginia State wideout Damon Thompson
and Livingstone defensive lineman Ronnie Washburn.

 &HT;    Reeves: `I don't think this team quit; we got beat'
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Falcons coach Dan Reeves, just a few days removed from
his team's 34-19 loss to the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXXIII,
was still sullen. However, he wasn't depressed as he reviewed the
season.
</P>
<P>
   When a team that had just seven winning seasons in its first 32
years goes 16-3 and sets a slew of team and individual records,
there is room for only so much gloom.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves disagreed with the notion that his team sealed its fate
with a frazzled week of preparation, in which several players were
more than a little boisterous and families were allowed to stay at
the team hotel.
</P>
<P>
   He also continued to insist that the Saturday-night arrest of
free safety Eugene Robinson on charges of soliciting oral sex from
a female undercover Miami police officer did not cost the Falcons
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we prepared ourselves and made decisions based on what
we thought was best,'' he said. ``We can't turn the ball over four
times against hardly any team, end up minus-three in turnovers and
win. We're a football team that's got to do things exactly right,
and we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of things went right for the Falcons this year, however,
as major injuries were kept to a minimum, a soft schedule worked to
their advantage and several players, including running back Jamal
Anderson and quarterback Chris Chandler, had the best seasons of
their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Most pundits picked the Falcons to finish in the middle of the
NFC West. Instead, they won the division title for just the second
time and came from behind to beat the heavily favored Vikings on
the road in overtime in the NFC Championship Game and record a
franchise-record 11th win in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal (before the season) was to make the playoffs, and
then anything's possible,'' Reeves said. ``From that standpoint, it
was a little bit of a surprise. I don't think this team quit; we
got beat. I don't think it's embarrassing to be an Atlanta Falcons
fan because we lost.

 &HT;    Browns don't count on bountiful draft
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Cleveland Browns brain trust of president Carmen
Policy, general manager Dwight Clark and coach Chris Palmer spent
last week examining the list of players available in Tuesday
afternoon's expansion draft and came away stating the obvious:
There simply aren't many quality young performers in the 150-player
pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players that we take,'' Palmer said, ``probably will
comprise the bottom one-third of our roster.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland can select between 30-42 veterans but must spend 38
percent of its salary cap. Such high-profile players as Baltimore
wideout Michael Jackson, Denver defensive end Neil Smith, Packers
wide receiver Robert Brooks and New Orleans quarterback Heath
Shuler are available. But most of the name veterans either are in
decline, have been injured recently or carry high salary-cap
figures.
</P>
<P>
   Look for the Browns instead to grab some bargains, such as
Pittsburgh nickel cornerback Jason Simmons, Tampa Bay defensive
tackle Marcus Jones and Dallas defensive linemen Antonio Anderson
and Hurvin McCormack.
</P>
<P>
   Clark also knows that if the Browns are going to select Kentucky
quarterback Tim Couch with the first overall pick on April 17,
they'd better get some veteran offensive linemen. Look for Patriots
guard Todd Rucci and perhaps Chicago tackle Andy Heck to be among
the first players taken by the Browns.The Johnson derby
</P>
<P>
   While the Minnesota Vikings theoretically can afford to retain
both Randall Cunningham and Brad Johnson, the real-life
implications of having two high-priced quarterbacks in the
salary-cap era will force a trade of the latter. Baltimore rookie
coach Brian Billick certainly is interested in former student
Johnson, but might have to battle Seattle for him. Seahawks coach
Mike Holmgren called Vikes counterpart Dennis Green last week to
get a feel for the asking price. The reply was that it will cost
the Seahawks, who can't count on youngster Jon Kitna yet, a quality
defender such as end Michael Sinclair. The eight-year veteran has
41 1/2 sacks the last three seasons, with a league-high 16 1/2 in
1998. Getting him would allow John Randle to move back inside to
tackle, or Sinclair could replace end Derrick Alexander if he
departs in free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos' Davis sore
</P>
<P>
   Denver tailback Terrell Davis played the Super Bowl with a
strained groin bad enough to keep him out of practice six days
before the game and severely limit his work in the Wednesday
practice, when backup Derek Loville took most of the snaps with the
No. 1 unit. ``It was sore, real sore, but word never got out about
it,'' Davis said. Coach Mike Shanahan, fined $15,000 by the league
for not reporting an injury to John Elway during the season, listed
Davis as ``probable'' all week. Davis will miss today's Pro Bowl
because of a shoulder injured in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Tip sheet
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Browns don't take Glenn Foley in the expansion
draft, the Jets plan to be rid of the veteran quarterback. Bill
Parcells hopes to sign Patriots reserve Scott Zolak, a free agent,
to back up Vinny Testaverde. ... Cincy owner Mike Brown has granted
agent Steve Zucker permission to seek a trade for wide receiver
Carl Pickens. The team will slap a ``franchise'' label on Pickens,
then try to deal him before the draft. ... New Orleans is trying to
trade for Giants cornerback Carlton Gray. ... He wasn't invited to
the scouting combine workouts later this month, but scouts are hot
on the trail of Fort Valley State defensive end Peppi Zellner, an
upfield pass-rusher with 4.58 speed. ... Buffalo will sign
defensive end Phil Hansen, the leading tackler at his position in
the past four seasons, to a three-year contract extension soon. ...
There now are whispers that the proposed Turner-NBC league won't
kick off until 2001. ... Kansas City is interested in Steve DeBerg
as its quarterbacks coach. ... Detroit middle linebacker Stephen
Boyd is one of the top unrestricted free agents, but teams will be
wary of his injury background. A second surgery to repair an
injured shoulder might be necessary. ... Kerry Collins (New
Orleans) and Trent Green (Washington) are the top free-agent
quarterbacks. When the market opens for business Friday, though,
the guy getting the most action might be Chiefs backup Rich
Gannon.Shedd-ing their cap
</P>
<P>
   Oakland is $19.6 million over the '99 salary-cap figure and
Raiders vice president Bruce Allen obviously is scrounging for
every penny. Allen last week proposed lowering the salary of backup
wide receiver Kenny Shedd from $500,000 to $400,000. The $100,000
difference would be recouped if the four-year pro caught four
passes, scored one touchdown or returned four kickoffs. As of
Thursday, nine teams were over the '99 cap. San Francisco, about
$25 million over, already has cut cornerback Marquez Pope and
tailback Terry Kirby. Agent Pat Dye Jr. already has been told that
cornerback Antonio Langham and tight end Irv Smith won't be back,
and linebacker Ken Norton Jr. and free safety Merton Hanks also
could be on the Niners' hit list.
</P>
<P>
   Thin crop
</P>
<P>
   The pool of unrestricted players is expected to be the leanest
in years when the signing period begins Monday. Here's how one NFC
personnel director rated the top 12, with a disclaimer that several
either would re-sign by Friday or be designated ``franchise''
players: LB Jamir Miller (Arizona), CB Dale Carter (Kansas City),
WR Antonio Freeman (Green Bay), WR Carl Pickens (Cincinnati), DT
Santana Dotson (Green Bay), DE Chad Bratzke (Giants), C Wally
Williams (Baltimore), SS Carnell Lake (Pittsburgh), QB Kerry
Collins (Saints), SS Robert Griffith (Vikings), OT Orlando Brown
(Ravens) and WR Rob Moore (Cardinals).
</P>
<P>
   No laughing matter
</P>
<P>
   The fallout from the Eugene Robinson incident even caused
difficulty for one Denver player. On ``The Tonight Show'' on
Tuesday, wide receiver Ed McCaffrey jokingly told host Jay Leno
that his wife was upset because Robinson ``only offered her $20
earlier in the week.'' Lisa McCaffrey rose from her seat in the
audience and flipped her husband a dirty bird of a different kind.
``After the show she told me, 'It's sofa city, sweetheart,'''
McCaffrey said Wednesday after spending Tuesday night on the couch.

 &HT;    Bouchard still part of hockey scene
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dan Bouchard was in goal when the Ice Age came South
in 1972 with the creation of the Atlanta Flames, and he was the
last of them remaining when it melted away eight years later with
the team's move to Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the NHL prepares its Atlanta return after a 19-year
absence, Bouchard remains right where it all began _ living in his
adopted hometown and still very much a part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of tending goal in the NHL, the Montreal native is
behind the bench as coach of the Life University Skating Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   With little fanfare, Bouchard started the hockey program at the
Marietta school in 1995 and turned it into an instant success. With
a roster loaded with Canadians, Life finished second in the
American Collegiate Hockey Association's Division II tournament its
first season, then won the national title the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard isn't ready to stop there. Life, again ranked No. 1 in
its region, is a favorite to win a third championship in a row the
first week of March in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a way to give back to a sport that has given me so
much,'' said Bouchard, who retired in 1986 after 14 seasons and 288
victories with three franchises. ``I'm really enjoying myself. This
is a long way from the NHL, but it's been fun.''
</P>
<P>
   That he is coaching at a college named Life carries special
meaning for Bouchard, 48. Nine years ago, he wasn't sure what the
rest of his life would hold or how much time he had left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very scary,'' said Janet, Bouchard's wife of 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   Suffering from dizziness and a progressive loss of hearing,
Bouchard underwent a series a tests that revealed a tumor behind
his left ear. The growth was benign, but the neurosurgery required
was tricky. Side effects were possible, with no guarantees of a
complete recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``They needed to cut me open to see if a goalie really had a
brain,'' Bouchard can say now with a laugh. At the time, jokes
weren't funny.
</P>
<P>
   The operation at Emory University Hospital was supposed to take
about eight hours. It lasted closer to 15. A growth about the size
of a tangerine was removed.
</P>
<P>
   The operation was a success, but Bouchard lost the hearing in
his left ear and the side of his face was temporarily paralyzed
because of trauma to the facial nerves. For nearly a year, his left
eyelid was stitched partially shut as a precaution while the facial
nerves rejuvenated.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked a fright for a while,'' Janet said. ``It wasn't a
good time to be between hockey jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bouchard landed a job as goalie coach with Quebec Nordiques,
one of his former teams, and held it until Pierre Page was fired
four years later.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard was in business in Atlanta when he was approached about
helping start a hockey team at Life. It was something he decided he
couldn't pass up.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, hockey is a club sport at Life, and teams in the
American Collegiate Hockey Association can't give athletic
scholarships. But with Bouchard as coach, the program goes as
first-class as possible. Although attendance for home games at The
Cooler in Alpharetta is usually only about 200 to 400 people, Life
has the resources to travel by plane on at least three round trips
per season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between our team and some of the ones we play
is like night and day,'' high-scoring winger Jason Lyewski said.
``We're on a completely different level.''
</P>
<P>
   Scheduling is Bouchard's biggest frustration. ``I want to play
better competition, but teams won't play us or are too far away.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Southeastern teams don't have the skill or experience to
match Life, whose 24 players include 14 Canadians and average 24
years old. The Skating Eagles beat Florida 8-0 and 13-0 last
weekend, and Georgia Tech 16-2 earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Canadians came South because of Bouchard, but most
were lured by Life's chiropractic program. All but seven players
hope to be chiropractors. Both goalies _ Jarred Buffie and Eric
Legault _ came to Life from Canada for that reason; getting to work
with a former NHL goalie is a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   As a player, Bouchard was emotional on the ice and outspoken off
it. But he practices tender loving care in English and French with
his goalies, keeping instruction on technique simple and
concentrating on the mental part of the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sometimes gets on the other players,'' Buffie said. ``But
not with us. He is always encouraging. He knows what we are going
through, and it really helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard, who someday would like to return to the NHL, has
conducted several clinics for the Atlanta Thrashers. He is
confident the NHL expansion team will be a success at the gate when
it opens play next fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old Flames fans were great,'' remembered Bouchard,
recalling the chants of''Bou-chard, Bou-chard, Bou-chard!'' at the
Omni. ``I always knew Atlanta would get another team. I just didn't
think it would take this long.''
</P>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four police officers who killed an unarmed West
African immigrant in a fusillade of 41 gunshots will waive immunity
and testify before a Bronx grand jury this week if they receive
assurances that a federal inquiry will not intervene and expose
them to whip-sawing between federal and state prosecutors, a person
close to the officers said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A day after federal officials announced that they were joining
the Bronx district attorney in the investigation of the death of
22-year-old Amadou Diallo last Thursday, there were no major
developments in the investigation of a case that has raised a storm
of protest from community and religious leaders, African-American
groups, politicians and acquaintances of the slain man.
</P>
<P>
   But the intervention of the federal officials, who said only
that they would be working closely with District Attorney Robert
Johnson, appeared to be subtly affecting the behind-the-scenes
legal maneuvering to obtain first-hand accounts of a shooting whose
only witnesses appear to be the officers who fired the fatal
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   What the officers and their lawyer, Stephen Worth, are worried
about is the possibility that federal officials could preempt the
state grand jury after they testify, and summon them before a
federal grand jury, said the person close to the officers, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the officers told substantially the same story before
the state and federal grand juries, this person said, they might be
caught in contradictions, however minor, that might cast doubt on
their accounts and expose them to criminal prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   Worth, a lawyer hired by the officers through the auspices of
the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, declined to comment
Saturday on whether his clients would be willing to waive immunity
and testify, or to say whether they would insist upon any
conditions in exchange for their testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``They re not afraid of talking,'' Worth said. ``But it is my
advice that they not do so until we see which agency is going to
handle this.''
</P>
<P>
   Worth said the officers did not intend to speak publicly about
what happened, but he noted that they were aware of the public
outcry over the case and felt sorrow over the death of a man said
to be a devout Muslim and a hard-working street peddler who had
never been in trouble with the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``These men are human beings,'' Worth said of the officers.
``They have a job to do, and they try to do it well. They did not
wake up and say, `Let's shoot a street peddler today.' They
recognize the tragedy that a man died, and was not armed at the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, detectives continued to search for witnesses on the
Wheeler Avenue block, in the Soundview section, where the shooting
occurred. But, as on Thursday and Friday, they found no one who
acknowledged having seen the shooting in the vestibule at No. 1157.
</P>
<P>
   Protests over the shooting continued Saturday. A half-block from
Diallo's door, about 30 people, rallying under the banners of the
Progressive Labor Party, marched in a circle with signs that read:
``Smash Police Brutality,'' ``Stop Killer Cops,'' and ``Destroy
Police Terror with Communist Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   A prayer vigil and rally was scheduled for 2 p.m. Sunday at the
scene of the shooting by the Rev. Al Sharpton. Diallo's father, a
businessman currently working in Vietnam, was on his way to New
York, but it was not clear whether he would be present for the
rally. He is to take the body home to Guinea, West Africa, later
this week for burial.

LEGAL LANDSCAPE CHANGING FOR CITY'S X-RATED BUSINESSES 
</HEADLINE>

 By VIVIAN S. TOY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When police officers and building inspectors
descended on a popular Queens strip club, Goldfingers, to shut it
down a few nights ago, many of the club's neighbors were delighted
and relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have hundreds of kids here day and night, so do I think it's
good that it's closed _ yes, absolutely,'' said Joann Ciorciari,
the manager of the Lost Battalion Hall, a Parks Department
recreation center on the block next to Goldfingers in Rego Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men have a right to go see women dancing naked,'' she said.
``But you should put it where it belongs and not near homes and
places where children go.''
</P>
<P>
   The youth center, the largest in Queens, and the apartment
buildings that line Queens Boulevard near the club are precisely
the reasons city officials were able to padlock Goldfingers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the city started enforcing a new zoning law in July
regulating ``adult establishments,'' the owners of Goldfingers
bought the club a few extra months by admitting minors and creating
what the club called a nonadult game room, where customers could
play chess, dominoes and jacks.
</P>
<P>
   But a state judge ordered the club closed last week, calling the
club's changes a ``transparent sham'' intended to evade the law,
and labeling the owners' reasoning ``absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark D. Alonso, a lawyer for Goldfingers, said that the club's
owners had not yet decided whether to appeal the judge's decision,
to turn the club into a regular nightclub or to close down for
good.
</P>
<P>
   The Goldfingers decision was one of two significant court
victories for the Giuliani administration, both of which narrowed
loopholes in the zoning law that had allowed many sex
establishments to remain open.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the appellate division of the state Supreme Court
emphatically overturned a judge's ruling that had allowed a
Manhattan topless club to stay open as a nonadult establishment on
the ground that it admitted minors.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions underscore the ever-changing legal landscape
governing the city's X-rated businesses. Earlier, topless clubs and
video shops had won a handful of court victories that punched
loopholes in the zoning law and frustrated the Giuliani
administration. Ultimately, future rulings and appeals could bring
further changes.
</P>
<P>
   In Queens, the closing of Goldfingers was hailed as a major
victory by local officials, who had battled for years to rid the
area of strip clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Goldfingers is the last of four adult-entertainment clubs to be
closed in the residential neighborhoods of Rego Park and Forest
Hills. While other clubs, with names like Wiggles and Runway 69,
prompted louder and more vehement protests, Goldfingers was one of
the main reasons why Queens officials helped draft legislation to
make sex shops and strip clubs illegal within 500 feet of schools,
churches or other sex shops.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Manhattan officials had pushed for similar
legislation to rid Times Square of sex shops, but politicians in
the other boroughs resisted, fearing that the sex shops would head
into their neighborhoods if they were driven from Times Square. As
it turned out, the redevelopment of Times Square had the same
effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goldfingers was definitely one of the places that triggered
the legislation,'' said City Councilman John D. Sabini, whose
district encompasses Goldfingers and the Lost Battalion Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they started cleaning up Times Square, these places
started popping up on the natural byways out of Manhattan, like
Queens Boulevard and Northern Boulevard. The problem is, these
byways may move fast, but there are also lots of people who live
along them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR;  &LR;  (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rachel Pradhan, 17, who lives in the Queens Boulevard Tower
apartments, down the block from Goldfingers, waved good riddance to
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's degrading to have a place like that around,'' she said.
``It's not something you want around your house. Guys would come
out of there at all hours making all kinds of noise.''
</P>
<P>
   Ciorciari said that while her recreation center is essentially
closed to children under 15 at 6 p.m. when the after-school program
shuts down, dozens of teen-agers fill the center's basketball
courts, weight room and boxing center late into the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you think that these boys didn't know about that place,
you must be out of your mind,'' she said. ``I'm sure some of them
have been in there, and that's just not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Alonso, the Goldfingers lawyer, had argued that once the
nonadult game room was created, less than 40 percent of the club's
floor space was dedicated to sex entertainment and thus the club
complied with previous court rulings that allowed such businesses
to stay open.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Arthur W. Lonschein of state Supreme Court in Queens
found that the game room was not open to the public when city
inspectors visited the club, and ruled that the club therefore
exceeded the limit.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also mocked the club's claim that the addition of the
game room meant that Goldfingers could not legally be classified an
adult-entertainment club. ``No one would pay $10 to enter this
place to play chess, or jacks or tiddlywinks,'' he wrote in his
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge is saying that it's not enough to have a 60 percent
nonadult space, but it has to be as busy as the other areas, too,''
Alonso said. ``So if more people went to see `The Blue Room' just
to see Nicole Kidman naked instead of going to hear the dialogue
with their eyes closed, does that make that theater an adult
theater?''
</P>
<P>
   While lawyers continue to dispute the application of the 40
percent limit, Walter L. McCaffrey, a Queens city councilman who
spearheaded the sex shop zoning law, said the limit was never meant
to apply to strip clubs but was intended to address the inventory
of adult video and book stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were debating the law, we said explicitly that the
limit did not apply to live entertainment, because how do you have
a strip club that's only 40 percent naked?'' he said. ``There's no
such thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Karan Sunar, a father of three young girls who often eats at the
Burger King next to Goldfingers, offered a suggestion for where
Goldfingers might move.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very family-oriented area,'' he said. ``Those places
don't belong here _ maybe in Manhattan.''

THE DEMISE OF THE GLOWING PUCK  
 RETURNING TO NEW ENGLAND ROOTS  
 MORE THAN BRAGGADOCIO 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to legend, if the puckhog sees his shadow in early
February, it means 19 more weeks of hockey. And so it is. The
playoff pairings won't be determined until after the income tax
deadline, and the Stanley Cup won't be won until shortly before the
summer solstice. Until then, in arenas across the continent, over
intrusively loud speaker systems, the recorded rock bands play on.
And on. They will, they will, ROCK YOU!
</P>
<P>
   Another loud annoyance, the Fox network, begins its lame-duck
season Sunday with several regional telecasts, including the
Rangers at Boston. Viewers will note one improvement through
deletion: Fox no longer uses the glowing puck that baffled and
irritated so many fans for several seasons. The glowing rubber took
the most heat, but it was really the least of Fox's many sins.
</P>
<P>
   Worse were its confusing, end-zone camera angles during live
action, which will probably return. If Fox producers and directors
wanted to learn how to present hockey the right way, they would
simply watch and copy the technical experts at the MSG network, who
wisely use high and wide camera angles from the side during live
action while saving the cute stuff for replays and whistle stops.
But Fox reinvented the puck, so don't tell them what to do. In
keeping with its prime-time style, Fox should add a recorded laugh
track to its hockey camera work.
</P>
<P>
   But let's not be too negative because there will be
improvements. Instead of taking more than 15 minutes to finish its
cluttered pre-game show, Fox will permit games to start at eight
minutes after the hour. Still, Fox intermissions again will be
longer than usual and so will its four television timeouts during
each period. Lou Lamoriello, general manager of the Devils,
recognizes the timeout problem, even in non-Fox games when the
breaks are only 70 seconds. ``The important thing is getting the
games to have a flow and have the fans enjoying what they are
seeing,'' Lamoriello said. ``Our commercials really have hurt that.
Even the players, it hurts them sometimes to get out of the flow.''
</P>
<P>
   RETURNING TO NEW ENGLAND ROOTS
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, freshly flowing from Thursday's 8-4 victory over
Mark Messier's Vancouver Canucks, will face a bunch of Bruins who
were 0-6-1 in the seven games before Saturday afternoon's visit to
Philadelphia. The Rangers and the Bruins are among several teams
contending for the eighth and final playoff berth in the Eastern
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   A key Ranger for Fox and fans to watch will be Brian Leetch, the
captain and attacking defenseman, who will be returning to his New
England roots. Now that Leetch has ended his 23-game goal drought
by scoring his seventh of the season Thursday, he might begin the
burst of production that could carry his team to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problem has been when we don't get enough chances and
don't put the puck in the net,'' Leetch said. ``I've had a lot of
opportunities during that streak. I think about it more when we are
not winning. It was good to get it out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Leetch played at Boston College and has been more productive
against the Bruins than against some opponents. In 34 games, he has
36 points, including two assists in a 3-3 tie earlier this season.
Over Leetch's career, Harry Sinden, the Bruins' general manager,
has aimed the occasional barb toward Leetch, implying that he is
not the caliber of either Bobby Orr or Ray Bourque.
</P>
<P>
   MORE THAN BRAGGADOCIO
</P>
<P>
   Such debates are fun for fans, but the stakes for Leetch this
season are bigger than braggadocio. He could become an unrestricted
free agent on July 1. Although his play has improved over last
season, Leetch is still not the game-breaker he was during
Messier's Ranger captaincy from 1991 through 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason could be the style of Coach John Muckler, who
does not let Leetch gamble as much as some past Ranger coaches.
Another reason may be the style of Wayne Gretzky, whose curls at
the opposing blue line take away the space that Leetch needed to
join rushes during the Messier years.
</P>
<P>
   When Leetch was left out of the All-Star Game two weeks ago, it
was not so much an unfair snub as it was a leaguewide recognition
that his play is no longer at the level of a Norris trophy
candidate. More than most Rangers, Leetch suffered hurt feelings
when Ranger bosses let his friend, Messier, leave as a free agent.
By ending his goal slump against Messier's team Thursday, Leetch
may have turned a symbolic page. He also used to complain that
Fox's electronic puck bounced around too much, and he doesn't have
that to worry about now.
</P>
<P>
   There is still plenty of time _ months, remember? _ for him to
rally his team into the playoffs and boost his profile for free
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Should Leetch fail, his market value will dwindle and he will be
forced to watch the entire tournament from home, including those
aggravating telecasts on Fox.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``That woman'' went to the Senate on Saturday, on
videotape, and contrary to advance word from Republicans that she
had seemed shockingly young _ just a girl, really _ Monica Samille
Lewinsky came across as mature, composed and ready for a career in
the law.
</P>
<P>
   Senators who had seen the tape earlier remarked that they had
been struck by her youth and vulnerability. Rep. James Rogan,
R-Calif., tried to introduce her as a victim, ``a bright lady whose
life has forever been marked by the most powerful man on earth.''
Throughout his argument, he referred to her as just Monica.
</P>
<P>
   And tacitly, he tried to get senators to think of her as their
own daughter or niece, ``that young woman,'' he said, ``very much
like a family member we might know.''
</P>
<P>
   But her appearance, voice and vocabulary said she was all grown
up.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a sensible suit, pearls, heavy makeup and a semi-hard
hairdo, Ms. Lewinsky was well spoken, used no slang and showed only
trace evidence of the Valley Girl of her taped phone conversations
with Linda Tripp that were released last year.
</P>
<P>
   Even her voice seemed different from that on those tapes, more
modulated and less high-pitched and breathy.
</P>
<P>
   As the personification of the sexual basis for the case, Ms.
Lewinsky was a tricky witness for the House managers. But there
were no sexual references in the testimony shown Saturday, and in
portions of testimony not shown, she did stand up for herself when
the managers strayed in that direction. She insisted that her
relationship with the president not be referred to as
``salacious.''
</P>
<P>
   In the brief biographical sketch that opened her testimony, she
was already sufficiently at ease to take a moment to lecture her
Republican questioner, Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., who had asked
whether in a college job working with the mentally ill she had had
any contact with patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``They refer to them as clients there,'' she said, a little
starch in her voice.
</P>
<P>
   Once or twice, she betrayed a certain disdain for her
questioners, raising her eyebrows and indicating that she did not
understand why she was being asked a question twice. But her
expressions _ looking up, frowning, pouting, even exhaling
dramatically while contemplating _ had a cumulative effect on her
credibility as a largely cooperative witness trying her best.
</P>
<P>
   She took a couple of gulps of air before beginning her
testimony, and occasionally tossed her head slightly, either in
annoyance or to get the hair out of her eyes. But through most of
it, she seemed older than her years, not younger, sure of herself
under enormous pressure and terribly well spoken. She was also
steadfast in refusing to help House managers connect the dots in
the case against the president. Asked the purpose of a 2 a.m. phone
call from the president, she answered, ``It was threefold. First,
to tell me that Ms. Currie's brother had been killed in a car
accident. Second, to tell me that my name was on a witness list for
the Paula Jones case. And thirdly, he mentioned the Christmas
present he had for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't he really calling to remind her to stick to their ``cover
story'' that she had seen him only to deliver papers, or visit his
secretary, Betty Currie? And wasn't the president pushing her, they
suggested, to file a false affidavit in Ms. Jones' sexual
misconduct suit? No, she said, she saw no link between mentioning
their usual cover story and discussing an affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   The best bits of Ms. Lewinsky's testimony _ or at least the best
lines from the leading lady in this drama _ were left on the
cutting room floor by the House prosecutors. In the deposition,
taken last Monday and released in transcript on Friday, she charmed
senators, made jokes at the expense of the House managers and at
one point had Bryant making objections to his own questions. ``We
sustain those,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., on Saturday emphasized Clinton's
bad choices, which, he said, had led to more bad choices. But Ms.
Lewinsky on Saturday left no question that the president had at the
very least chosen to behave inappropriately with a junior employee
who was loyal.

FATAL BARRAGE BY POLICE RENEWS DEBATE OVER SEMIAUTOMATIC HANDGUNS
</HEADLINE>
 (See also NY-SUSPECT-SHOT) 
(bl) 
By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The type of gun used here by four police officers
last week in the fatal shooting of an unarmed West African
immigrant is the weapon of choice among law enforcement agencies
across the country in the continually escalating arms race between
the police and criminals, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The barrage of 41 bullets sprayed at 22-year-old Amadou Diallo
in the vestibule of his Bronx building early Thursday morning has
revived questions about the safety of semiautomatic handguns, which
fire faster and carry more bullets than the .38 caliber revolvers
they replaced in the New York City Police Department six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani defended the use of 9 mms and
praised the New York force for ``being just about the most
restrained police department in the country,'' even as he described
the shooting as a ``terrible tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that there is no clear link between semiautomatics
and the number of shootings by police, and that officers are likely
to get higher-powered weapons rather than go back to traditional
handguns.
</P>
<P>
   More than 99 percent of the nation's municipal police forces
with more than 100 officers now authorize the use of semiautomatic
weapons, with 74 percent of the agencies choosing 9 mm handguns
like the ones involved in the New York incident, according to a
forthcoming study by the federal Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   New York was among the last to switch to semiautomatics; most
cities opted for more firepower in the mid-1980s, many prompted by
a 1986 shootout in Miami in which FBI agents ran out of bullets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threats nowadays are a lot more than they were years
ago,'' said Robert DelCore of the International Association of
Chiefs of Police. ``If you go back 30 years, you'd have a guy who
might have pulled a gun at you but who wouldn't fire. Go back 20
years, maybe they'd fire at you, a little Saturday Night Special.
Now it's escalated to where they carry little machine guns. You've
got to be prepared to meet the threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Criminologists said there had been no studies comparing the
number and severity of police shootings with semiautomatics vs.
revolvers, and a spokesman for the New York City Police Department
said he could not separate statistics based on the type of weapon
used. While several experts said anecdotal evidence indicates that
the number of shots fired per incident increases when guns such as
the 9 mm are used, they also noted that the number of police
shootings _ in New York and across the nation _ has declined
sharply even as the semiautomatic weapons have become standard
issue.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the rate of fatal police shootings per 1,000
officers was 0.48 last year, the lowest since 1985, and lower than
the rates in Chicago, Dallas, Miami, Philadelphia or Washington.
The number of shootings, and the shots fired per incident, have
fallen with the crime rate during the last four years: There were
344 shootings with an average of 5 rounds fired in 1995, and 249
incidents with an average of 3.4 shots fired last year, according
to Inspector Michael Collins, an NYPD spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The critical question in analyzing police shootings, law
enforcement experts said, is why officers pulled the trigger, not
which guns they were using.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the gun is, because they can all kill, the bigger
problem is the quick trigger,'' said David Lerner, a spokesman for
the Center for Constitutional Rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more about training, accountability and protocol
than it is about the weapon,'' said Paul Chevigny, a law professor
at New York University. ``I don't want to sound cold-hearted;
Diallo might be alive if they hadn't had automatic weapons. But I
don't think it makes that much difference.''
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, the difference would likely have been in
the number of shots fired. Two of the four officers emptied their
16-bullet magazines in the incident: Had they been carrying
revolvers, they would have had just 6 bullets each before needing
to reload. The medical examiner says 19 bullets hit Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   Another difference is in the impact of the bullets hitting their
target. Experts said that several bullets fired from a 9 mm gun
could hit a man without knocking him down, which could lead
officers to continue shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``These bullets would be passing through him so fast that he
could still be standing,'' explained Steven Edwards, who oversees
police research for the federal government's National Institute of
Justice. ``You have to remember this is happening in nanoseconds.
There's fright and flight that are operating here as well. It's not
something as rational as it may sound.''
</P>
<P>
   The police favor the 9 mm handguns not only because they
discharge quickly, unloading up to 18 bullets in about four
seconds, but because they carry more rounds and can be reloaded
simply and fast.
</P>
<P>
   As a semiautomatic, the 9 mm, like the .38 caliber revolver it
replaced, fires only one round each time the trigger is pulled. But
it recocks itself after each shot, placing another bullet in the
chamber, and thus can release a succession of bullets quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Lighter than the .38, the ``9,'' as it is known, rests more
naturally in a shooter's palm, and often increases accuracy. But
the real attraction is the magazine, which holds up to three times
as many bullets as a revolver, and the ease of reloading. A 9 is
refilled in a two-step process that takes about four seconds, can
be done in the dark, and has been compared to popping a disk into a
computer; reloading a revolver takes two hands, eight separate
movements, and about 12 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   New York originally allowed magazines of just 10 bullets, and
now uses clips of 16. The city also commissioned a special device
that increases the amount of pressure needed to pull the trigger,
from about 5.5 pounds to about 12 pounds. Most patrol officers use
semiautomatics, though a handful of veterans have kept their .38s,
officials said. All four of the officers in the Bronx shootings had
9 mms; two were Sig Sauer models, one was a Glock and one was
manufactured by Smith &AMP; Wesson, police said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the potential for increased number of rounds
fired, critics question the reliability of the 9 mms.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, it's like saying Porsches are faster and more
powerful than Chevys, so we should equip the cops with Porsches,''
said James Fyfe, a criminologist at Temple University who
questioned the shift to nines. ``Chevys start every morning.''
</P>
<P>
   But the public does not like seeing the police outgunned. Police
shootings with large numbers of shots fired cause little outrage
compared with incidents like the Los Angeles bank robbery in 1997
in which officers had to borrow weapons from a gun shop to battle
suspects with machine guns.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than reconsider the move toward 9 mms, police departments
are looking at even more powerful guns: 15 percent of the municipal
departments currently authorize 10 mm semiautomatics, according to
the upcoming Justice Department study, 41 percent use .45 calibers
and 50 percent use .40 calibers. (9 mms are comparable to .357
calibers.) Some departments, experts say, are now allowing officers
to carry fully automatic rifles in their cars rather than shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's a genie you can put back in the bottle,''
said Edwards. ``The lingering concern would be whether there is
adequate policy and enforcement and training having to do with how
many shots you fire and when to stop shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Walsh, vice president of New York's Police Benevolent
Association, said the semiautomatic handgun ``is a tool of
necessity today,'' and noted that New York police officers are
``trained to shoot to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If an incident is stopped in one round, then we shoot one
round,'' he said. ``If it's stopped in five, it'll be that many.''
</P>
<P>
   While it remains a mystery why all four officers fired, and
fired so many times, in the Bronx shooting, Fyfe said that, in
general, he is more troubled by incidents in which only one officer
out of a group fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to wonder what he saw that no one else saw,'' Fyfe
said, speaking hypothetically. ``If you think about the options
here, you either have four homicidal maniacs who happen to be
working together, or you have four rational guys who all saw the
same thing. The chances are, you don't have four homicidal
maniacs.''

NICHOLAS KRUSHENICK, 70, ABSTRACT AND POP ARTIST
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nicholas Krushenick, a New York painter whose bold,
posterlike paintings were often called abstract Pop, died Feb. 5 at
Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 70 and lived in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was liver cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Krushenick was born in New York in 1929 and attended DeWitt
Clinton High School in the Bronx. He studied painting at the Art
Students League and at the informal painting school overseen by the
Abstract Expressionist Hans Hofmann, whose theory of ``push-pull''
promoted the use of bright, contrasting colors to activate a
painting's space.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1950s Krushenick made collages of somewhat geometric
figures, and he had his first solo show at the Camino Gallery in
1957. The next year he quit his job in the frame shop of the Museum
of Modern Art and, with his brother John, founded the Brata
Gallery, an early 10th Street artists' cooperative. The artists who
showed at Brata included Al Held, Ronald Bladen, George Sugarman
and Yayoi Kusama. Like Krushenick, they were all seeking more
straightforward, hard-edged alternatives to the emotionalism of
Abstract Expressionism.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1960s, Krushenick had solidified the geometric
aspect of his work into simple abstract motifs sometimes suggestive
of landscapes, sometimes of billboards, whose shapes were outlined
in heavy black lines. Although similar to the paintings based on
cartoons that Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol were making,
Krushenick's paintings kept their distance from the images of
commercial art.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, Krushenick began to show in uptown galleries, including
Graham, Fischbach and Pace (now Pace Wildenstein), where he had
three shows between 1967 and 1972. His most recent New York
exhibition was at the Mitchell Algus Gallery in 1997. He was a
visiting artist at many art schools and universities and taught
from 1977 to 1991 at the University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Krushenick's work is represented in many public collections in
the United States and Europe, including the Museum of Modern Art,
the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum of American
Art in New York; the Museum of Fine Arts in Dallas; the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art; the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, and the
Stedelijk in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Julia, and a son, Shawn, both of
Manhattan.

 &HT;    Leaving a landmark: Saying goodbye to the Gardens
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Danny McDonald wasn't there for the Beatles. He didn't
make it for visits by Winston Churchill or Muhammad Ali or Evel
Knievel or the King (Elvis) or the Queen (Elizabeth _ actually she
was only a princess at the time).
</P>
<P>
   But McDonald won't forget his first visit to the old brick
building once labeled ``the church of hockey'' by Wayne Gretzky,
who grew up an hour away in Brantford, Ontario. It was 26 years
ago, and McDonald was going to his first training camp with the
Toronto Maple Leafs, Day 1 of his Hall of Fame career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked into Maple Leaf Gardens and just sat in the dark in
the stands,'' he said. ``The only light was from the exit signs. It
was the most peaceful time I remember. I remember someone coming up
to me ... asking for an interview, and I asked him to wait 10 or 15
minutes. I just wanted to sit there, soaking it in.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald paused before adding, ``Moving to a new building makes
all the sense in the world from a business standpoint. But from a
purist standpoint, when this building's gone, a big part of hockey
will go with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Maple Leaf Gardens' date with a wrecking ball remains uncertain.
But its existence as the last of the NHL's six original venues ends
this week. The Leafs will host Carolina on Wednesday and Chicago on
Saturday before moving to the new Air Canada Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Blackhawks game will come 67 years and three months after
the Leafs opened the Gardens with a 2-1 loss to Chicago in 1931.
Fans paid 95 cents to $2.75 for admission. Scalpers are getting
$3,500 for Saturday. A lottery was held for 500 pairs of seats ``in
the grays,'' the upper level, and entries arrived from as far away
as Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a kid growing up in Canada, it was like going to Yankee
Stadium,'' said former Leaf Darryl Sittler, whose 10-point night at
the Gardens in 1976 has survived Gretzky's and Mario Lemieux's
assault on the record books. ``The first time I visited there, I
couldn't believe how big it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Big? Size is everything in pro sports, but the Gardens' capacity
of 15,726 is considered undersized by today's standards and seats
4,000 fewer than the new arena. Maple Leaf Gardens has pictures of
old players hanging in the corridors, ushers who have worked there
past retirement age and a lot of history, but not much else. The
building has hosted lacrosse, track and field, speed skating,
beauty pageants, church services, bicycle races, ballets, circuses,
orchestras, operas, choirs, memorial services, political rallies,
roller derby, bingo, rodeos, softball, aquatic shows, water polo
and weddings.
</P>
<P>
   The first NBA game was played there: New York Knickerbockers 68,
Toronto Huskies 66.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies survived only a year. Most of the memories revolve
around the Leafs and their late owner, Harold Ballard. Ballard once
caused a revolt among players when he fired coach Roger Neilson.
When he was unable to find a replacement immediately, he rehired
Neilson a few days later _ and asked the coach to step out behind
the bench with a paper bag over his head, then lift it on cue and
shock the fans. Neilson declined.
</P>
<P>
   Ballard also painted the logo of his other toy, the CFL's
Hamilton Tiger Cats, on the ice, which didn't please fans of the
Toronto Argonauts. There also was the time he billed construction
improvements at his house to the Maple Leafs, resulting in a fraud
conviction and one year in prison, and the time he was seen after
the circus late one night riding a motorcycle on the Gardens' floor
_ in the nude and with a female circus worker on his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Former Atlanta Flame Tim Ecclestone, who grew up in Toronto and
played briefly with the Leafs, recalled when he was first traded to
Toronto, ``Jim Gregory, the general manager, took me upstairs,
where (Ballard) had a three-bedroom apartment. I walk in, and
Gregory introduces me, and Mr. Ballard says, 'We're proud to have
you with us, Jim.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ecclestone, McDonald and Sittler will be among some 150 alums in
attendance Saturday. There will be ceremonies after the game and a
parade Feb. 19 to carry the four Stanley Cup banners from the old
arena to the new one. The Gardens will be used for junior games and
a practice site for at least two years. But if it is not
financially viable, it will be leveled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be fun, seeing the pictures and all the old
doormen and ushers again,'' McDonald said. ``The place has been
like a second home for a lot of people.''

 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Here are two more reasons for New Yorkers to move to
New Jersey: 1. the Rangers; 2. the Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   Scenes from Manhattan: Despite an 8-4 win over Vancouver last
week, the Rangers are floundering with one of the league's top
payrolls, and the heat is on general manager Neil Smith. New York
is in danger of missing the playoffs for the second season in a
row, and the Wayne Gretzky window might close after this year.
Rangers czar Dave Checketts denies speculation that Smith is gone
if the team falls short of the postseason again: ``Neil is doing
nothing more than carrying out what everybody in the organization
agreed on: To build the foundation of a club that will be good for
a long time. We wanted him to get the team younger and faster and
get size. He's done that with the moves he's made. ... We knew
there would be some pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Scenes from Long Island: General manager Mike Milbury dealt
talented young defenseman Bryan Berard to Toronto for goalie Felix
Potvin. Milbury then fired himself as coach and promoted assistant
Bill Stewart, who prefers Tommy Salo as his starting goalie. No
wonder. Potvin lost his first five starts as an Islander, yielding
an average of 4.47 goals per game, and allowed six goals in six
minutes against Ottawa. Can it get worse? Yes. Rich Winter, Salo's
agent, says his client will not play for the Islanders next year.
If that's true, Salo could be in a Thrashers uniform. Most teams
will protect only one goalie in the amateur draft, and the Isles
won't look good if they give up on Potvin after dealing Berard.
</P>
<P>
   NEW START
</P>
<P>
   With everything going right for Philadelphia general manager Bob
Clarke of late, it wouldn't be surprising if the Flyers can
rehabilitate Russian defenseman Andrei Kovalenko, who was acquired
from Edmonton in the three-way deal involving Alexandre Daigle. The
final straw with Kovalenko for Edmonton GM Glen Sather was a curfew
violation _ partying all night after a game in Los Angeles, then
missing the team charter the next morning. Clarke is not going into
the project blind: Of Kovalenko, he said, ``His reputation precedes
him. He likes his beer, but a lot of good players have drunk a lot
of beer over the years. If we find out his off-ice stuff isn't
good, we won't keep him.''
</P>
<P>
   ETC.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres, who have hit a lull, admit to jealousies between
players. It even got to the point that Michal Grosek asked coach
Lindy Ruff to be put on a new line because he felt Miroslav Satan
was shooting too much to keep his scoring streak alive. Forward
Dixon Ward said, ``It's like a marriage. It's always great after
the honeymoon. The true test is when things aren't going well and
how you react. You either get divorced or find a way to get through
it.'' ... Alexei Kovalev had three goals and seven points in 14
games with the Rangers. Since being traded to Pittsburgh, he has 12
goals and 23 points in 28 games. ... The surprising cover boy on
the NHL's new stat and history annual, ``Total Hockey,'' is Buffalo
right wing Rob Ray. His reasoning: ``Orr, Howe, Ray. Maybe they
were looking for someone with a short name.''

 &HT;    Thrashers GM continues scouting
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Don Waddell Over the World Tour continues. After
spending four days at the NHL general managers meetings in Palm
Springs, Calif., the Thrashers GM was scheduled to scout four
Canadian juniors games in three days over the weekend and a Calgary
Flames game Monday night before returning to Atlanta on Tuesday.
... There were no significant developments at the GM meetings, but
Waddell was quizzed often by his fraternity members on the team's
plans. Informal discussions already have begun about potential
trades or side deals before the expansion draft in June. Expansion
clubs often will agree not to draft specific unprotected players in
exchange for compensation from the respective clubs. Most of the
attention continues to be on goaltending. Dallas (Roman Turek) and
Detroit (Norm Maracle) are uncertain of plans with their
sought-after backup goalies. ``There was a lot of dialogue about
certain players this week,'' Waddell said. ``But I think what we've
found is (that) patience in our business is priceless. The longer I
don't make a deal, it works in the best interest of the team. Teams
have 48 hours after the last playoff game to make trades. Right
now, other GMs are just feeling me out.'' ... There were no
proposed rule changes made in Palm Springs, and the issue of
whether to take out overtime was tabled until the next meetings
during the playoffs. ... The Thrashers this week will announce an
inner-city street-hockey program to be held in conjunction with the
NHL and Nike. Willie O'Ree, the first African-American player in
NHL history, and team goaltending consultant Andy Moog will be in
attendance.

   LAND SHARKS
</P>
<P>
   San Jose players and coaches groused about having to start the
season with two games in Japan. But that's heaven compared with
this: The Sharks began a 10-game, 17-day road trip Wednesday, the
longest uninterrupted trip in league history. The Calgary Flames
had 11 road games in a row in 1987-88, but there was an
intermission to wash socks; the All-Star break came after three
games. ``It was an absolute nightmare,'' said former Flames goalie
Mike Vernon, now with the Sharks. San Jose players will log 7,123
air miles, flying to Phoenix, Los Angeles, Phoenix again, Chicago,
St. Louis, Tampa Bay, Florida, Detroit, Buffalo and Washington. But
the Sharks have to blame themselves. They operate their own arena,
and they booked a tennis tournament (Feb. 8-14) and an ice show
(Feb. 17-21) back to back.

 &HT;    Problems surface for Wings in Woetown
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Remember all those warm and fuzzy stories during
Detroit's run to its second consecutive Stanley Cup last year? Long
gone. Here's a six-pack of problems: 1. Backup goalie Norm Maracle
was charged with speeding and drunken driving last week. 2.
Defenseman Larry Murphy suffered a concussion when he was run into
the boards by New Jersey's Krzysztof Oliwa. Murphy was sidelined,
the league did not suspend Oliwa and, worse, none of Murphy's
teammates went after Oliwa, who also had taken a shot at Steve
Yzerman. 3. Sergei Fedorov has been critical of coach Scotty Bowman
for giving him limited playing time and shuffling lines. 4. Detroit
continues to hover barely above .500 and is struggling against
teams with winning records. 5. Three starting defensemen are out
with injuries, including free-agent acquisition Uwe Krupp. 6.
Brendan Shanahan finally ended a 15-game goal-scoring drought the
other night _ but the Wings lost at home to the mediocre Rangers.
Shanahan remains central to trade rumors. ``No one has come to me
and told me anything,'' Shanahan said. It might not be a bad time
to leave.
</P>
<P>
   TRADE BAIT
</P>
<P>
   One sidelight to the trade rumors involving Los Angeles
defenseman Steve Duchesne: He has a no-trade clause in his contract
and would have to approve any deal. The Kings re-signed Duchesne as
an unrestricted free agent before the season, but he has been a
$10.75 million bust. He was expected to improve the power play but
had only three goals and 17 assists through 50 games, and L.A. has
the third-fewest power-play goals in the league. Those facts, and
that Duchesne never has been a physical player, is wearing on coach
Larry Robinson and general manager Dave Taylor. Taylor reportedly
offered Duchesne to Philadelphia for forward Alexandre Daigle,
since dealt to Tampa Bay, but was turned down. Robinson on
Duchesne: ``We've got a style we play, and you've got to get
involved physically. He plays too much with his stick.'' Duchesne
on Duchesne: ``It's been a struggle for me, and nobody wants to get
out of this struggle more than I do.''
</P>
<P>
   ETC.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Blues are 0-59-10 when trailing after two periods
since November 1996. ... Having exhausted all other avenues to
relieve symptoms of post-concussion syndrome, the Blues' Geoff
Courtnall is trying acupuncture. ... Nashville coach Barry Trotz on
the perceptions of a first-year team: ``Every time a team loses to
us, you would have thought the world ended.'' ... Colorado goalie
Patrick Roy on his two-year, $14.5 million extension: ``It means I
can break as many TVs as I want.'' The reference was to smashing
video equipment in a locker-room tirade earlier this season. ...
Despite sellouts and the league's best record, Dallas owner Tom
Hicks claims the Stars will lose between $3 million and $12 million
this season, in large part because of their $39 million payroll and
the lack of revenue from suites at Reunion Arena. The latter, at
least, will change in 2000 when Dallas moves into a new building.
Hicks anticipates the value of the franchise, which he bought for
$84 million in 1995, will jump to between $150 million and $200
million.

TURNING SEWAGE GAS INTO ELECTRICITY AND HEAT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Conn.)  By ANDREW C. REVKIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   YONKERS, N.Y. _ Sewage treatment plants purify water, but they
also foul the air, with plumes of methane and sulfur and nitrogen
oxides, which smell bad and contribute to smog and global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a sewage plant here is turning its unwanted gas into
electricity and heat. The only byproduct, officials say, is hot
water.
</P>
<P>
   The new fuel-cell system, the first for a sewage plant in North
America, has proved to be effective after a year of operation,
officials from the New York Power Authority said. The system
generates 200 kilowatts of electricity, enough to supply 60 typical
homes, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, more than 20 tons of gas that would otherwise
have simply been burned off in the open air or wafted away was
turned into electricity last year, said Shalom Zelingher, the
director of research for the Power Authority. The hot water
generated was used to warm bacteria that help break down the
sewage. ``This is not just a concept anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel cells run on hydrogen, which is contained in standard
fossil fuels like natural gas and gasoline, and also in methane.
They produce no significant pollution because they use a chemical
reaction to harvest energy from the fuel without burning it,
Zelingher said.
</P>
<P>
   The same process supplies electricity on the space shuttle and
is finding more uses each year on Earth, with fuel cells powering
vehicles, factories and, in a few weeks, the New York Police
Department precinct house in Central Park. Two fuel cells will turn
natural gas into electricity at the office tower at 4 Times Square.
Others are going to be installed in some city hospitals to provide
uninterrupted power during blackouts, Power Authority officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the biggest benefits come at a sewage plant,
officials said, where the system uses waste methane, which is
abundant and free, instead of natural gas or some other fuel that
must be bought. The systems can also be run with gas from
landfills.
</P>
<P>
   New York City environmental officials recently inspected the
Yonkers system and said they hoped to install fuel cells at some of
the city's 14 sewage plants, in hopes of recycling some of the 1.6
billion cubic feet of gas generated every year. Most of that gas is
now burned off in flares at the plants.
</P>
<P>
   Joel A. Miele Sr., the city's Commissioner of Environmental
Protection, said the device would be particularly welcome at plants
that have been plagued with odor problems from the excess gas.
``Sometimes our plants can be very, very unwelcome neighbors,''
Miele said.
</P>
<P>
   When engineers from the Power Authority presented their results
with the fuel cell, he recalled, ``It sounded like Santa Claus had
come early.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuel cells have been around for decades, but because of their
high price and complicated technology they have been relegated
until recently to exotic applications like the space program.
</P>
<P>
   Within the devices, a chemical process causes hydrogen from the
fuel and oxygen from the air to combine, making water and releasing
electrons. The electrons flow across plates like those in a car
battery and generate electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The Power Authority supplies electricity to public agencies,
powering everything from sewage plants and the New York City
subways to hospitals, schools and public housing. It has been
developing alternative power sources to cut the need to build
costly new power plants in the region, said Stephen Schoenholz, a
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The fuel cell in Yonkers is a standard commercial 200-kilowatt
unit made by the ONSI Corporation of New Windsor, Conn., which also
makes the fuel cells for the space shuttle. But the Power
Authority, together with federal environmental scientists, devised
an additional filter that first removes impurities from the waste
gas, like sulfur and nitrogen, that could damage the device.
</P>
<P>
   The system costs $1.3 million, but that price should drop as the
technology becomes more established, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The fuel cell test in Yonkers was partly supported by money from
the Department of Energy, New York State, and Westchester County,
which runs the sewage plant, Schoenholz said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yonkers plant, which handles more than 90 million gallons of
wastewater a day, has for many years used about half of the methane
as fuel for boilers and some engines, said Thomas Lauro, the deputy
director of wastewater treatment. Even though the staff plans to
exploit more of the gas to power machinery, it is unlikely they
will be able to find a use for all of it so a second fuel cell
could eventually be installed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal energy officials say one of the greatest benefits of
using a fuel cell at a sewage plant or landfill comes from
consuming methane, a gas that otherwise contributes significantly
to the growing greenhouse effect.
</P>
<P>
   Methane, carbon dioxide and other ``greenhouse gases'' prevent
the heat from the sun from readily escaping from the atmosphere
into space. As levels of these gases increase, the planet's average
temperature is expected to continue warming, scientists say,
raising sea levels and shifting patterns of droughts and floods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real two-fer,'' said Dan W. Reicher, the Assistant
Secretary of Energy for energy efficiency and renewable energy.
``It's a global warming gas that you can put to good use as a clean
power source.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's free, he added.

NEW LOW-COST AIRLINE PLANS TO FLY OUT OF KENNEDY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Ga, N.C., Pa., Texas, Utah, Vt.)  (rk) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 39-year-old Utah entrepreneur backed by George
Soros and several other big investors has raised a record $130
million to start the first major new low-cost airline at one of New
York's three main airports in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The new airline, which is temporarily being called New Air until
a permanent name is chosen, intends to start flying this fall to
four cities from Kennedy International Airport at prices as much as
80 percent below current fares. After three years, it plans to
serve as many as 50 destinations.
</P>
<P>
   New Air has been in the works for two years but its plans were
made official on Friday, when it filed an application with the
Federal Transportation Department in Washington for crucial takeoff
and landing slots at Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   It follows the announcement in December that Southwest Airlines,
the country's most successful low-cost carrier, will start flying
to four cities from MacArthur Airport on Long Island on March 14.
</P>
<P>
   Both Southwest and New Air could usher in a new era of low-cost
flying not seen in New York since People Express started flying out
of Newark International Airport in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 20 years, New York, which is the country's biggest
travel market, has seen average fares on short flights rise
slightly, while ticket prices on comparable routes in much of the
rest of the nation have fallen 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that after a low-fare airline enters a
market, ticket prices drop at all airports, even to destinations
that the new airline does not serve, and passenger traffic rises as
more people find they can afford to fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be good for everybody, except the big
airlines,'' said David Neeleman, the entrepreneur who spearheaded
the new venture and will be the airline's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   New Air will be the most richly capitalized start-up in aviation
history. In addition to $40 million from funds run by Soros, the
New York-based financier and philanthropist, the venture has the
backing of other large institutions, including the venture capital
arm of Chase Manhattan Bank.
</P>
<P>
   New Air has the enthusiastic support of key politicians,
including Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Gov. George E. Pataki, Sens.
Charles E. Schumer and Daniel Patrick Moynihan and much of the
state's congressional delegation and the Queens borough president,
Claire Shulman.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for political support from New York lawmakers, New
Air has pledged to make either Buffalo, Rochester or Syracuse one
of its first destinations and eventually to serve all three. They
are among the 20 cities in the country with the most expensive
average air fares, according to the Transportation Department.
</P>
<P>
   Neeleman said he has not yet decided where else the airline will
fly first, though he is considering a city in Florida. Other
possibilities include Atlanta; Burlington, Vt.; Charlotte, N.C.;
Pittsburgh, and Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The airline's filing said that once it starts flying to Dallas,
it planned to charge $169 for a one-way unrestricted ticket that
currently costs $818 on a major carrier. An advance-purchase
one-way ticket to Dallas would cost $89, according to the filing,
compared with $221 on a major carrier now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned about this when I started flying upstate in the
campaign,'' Schumer said last week. ``The ticket would be $400 and
you would be lucky if you got a bag of peanuts. There was an
arrogance at the two carriers _ US Air and Delta Express _ because
they knew they had no competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The fledgling airline is going to need all the help in
Washington it can muster to get the landing and takeoff slots it
needs to operate at Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1960s, the federal government has restricted
flights at the airport during the peak hours of 3 p.m. to 8 p.m.
Major airlines like American Airlines and Trans World Airlines
control most of the slots.
</P>
<P>
   Neeleman's attraction to Kennedy is that aside from those
afternoon and evening hours, when most international flights arrive
and take off, the airport is hardly used.
</P>
<P>
   But while it can fly freely to and from Kennedy in the morning
and late evening, New Air needs slots for the important afternoon
hours, when most business travelers want to get home.
</P>
<P>
   To meet its plan of flying to 50 cities by 2003, New Air has
asked the right to add 25 slot exemptions each year for the next
three years. (Each slot equals one opportunity a day to take off or
land.)
</P>
<P>
   Schumer made lowering air fares in the region a campaign pledge.
Last week, he held a get-acquainted session in his Washington
office between Neeleman and New York members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In January, he wrote a letter to Transportation Secretary Rodney
E. Slater that was also signed by Moynihan and four upstate
congressmen urging him to help New Air.
</P>
<P>
   The request for afternoon slots is certain to meet strong
opposition from the major airlines at Kennedy. But Schumer is
confident that New Air will get the slots it needs. ``I am
optimistic that DOT will understand the problem and try to solve
it,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   New Air would be the first carrier to make Kennedy its hub. The
airline will fly the newest narrow-body jets, either the Boeing 737
or the Airbus A320, which are much quieter than older airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   New Air will also need gates at Kennedy, which is currently
undergoing a $7 billion facelift. Though a terminal for a low-cost
domestic carrier is not in the master plan, Neeleman said the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates all three New
York-area airports, has been very helpful. ``They have several
options for us,'' he said. ``We're very confident that we will have
a great place.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with its low fares, New Air may face an uphill battle
persuading customers to fly out of Kennedy, which is difficult to
reach from Manhattan and has become more unattractive of late
because of the renovations there.
</P>
<P>
   But Neeleman said travelers would make up any extra travel time
on the runway because Kennedy has far fewer take-off delays than
does Newark or La Guardia Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Success in the notoriously perilous airline industry is far from
certain. Scores of new airlines were started in the 20 years since
the industry was deregulated in 1978. Most failed. Only one,
Phoenix-based America West Airlines, has become a major carrier.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, at least, New Air looks strong. Though only 39,
Neeleman already has a successful record as an entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, at the age of 23, he helped start Morris Air, a
low-fare airline based in Salt Lake City. After Morris Air was sold
to Southwest for $130 million in 1993, Neeleman walked away with
$20 million. He went on to help start Westjet, a low-cost airline
based in Calgary, Alberta, and a technology company that designs
airline reservation systems, which he recently sold to Hewlett
Packard.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he was committed to shaking up the airline industry
by providing a high level of service at low prices. New Air will
only have electronic tickets. Check-in will be automated so that
passengers can simply walk up to a kiosk at the terminal, swipe
their credit cards through a scanner, choose a seat on a computer
screen, and then receive a boarding pass, all without having to
deal with an agent.
</P>
<P>
   First, of course, New Air needs a new name. Neeleman's original
plan was to call the airline Virgin America. But a deal with
Richard Branson, the successful British entrepreneur who owns
Virgin Atlantic Airways, fell apart last year because federal laws
prevent foreigners from owning more than 25 percent of a domestic
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Neeleman then decided to call the airline Taxi _ the planes were
to be painted yellow with a black checkerboard stripe _ but he
cooled on the idea after he was informed that taxis do not exactly
project an image of safety and cleanliness to New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Which points to one stumbling block facing Neeleman in his aim
to make New Air ``New York's hometown airline.'' Born in Brazil,
where his father was a foreign correspondent for United Press
International, and raised in Salt Lake City, Neeleman has never
lived in the New York area.
</P>
<P>
   He said that many of his top executives, including New Air's
president, David J. Barger, who formerly ran the Continental
Airlines hub in Newark, were longtime New Yorkers who make up for
his lack of experience.
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as the school year is out in June and his wife gives
birth to the couple's ninth child, he intends to move East from
Salt Lake City with his family and dive right in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to buy a year's worth of Broadway tickets up front
and go every month,'' he said. ``That commits me so the months
don't go by and I don't go.''  &QL;

MAIER, A RUNAWAY TRAIN, RUMBLES TO DOWNHILL TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo.)  (lb) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAVER CREEK, Colo. _ Barreling down the Birds of Prey downhill
course like a freight train, Hermann Maier of Austria let nothing
get in the way of his second gold medal in the World Alpine Ski
Championships.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old Maier, his body strong and fluid, finished the
1.6-mile course in 1 minute 40.60 seconds. In second place, winning
the silver medal, was Maier's closest rival on the World Cup
circuit this year, Lasse Kjus, 28, of Norway.
</P>
<P>
   Kjus was .31 of a second behind Maier. In third, was 27-year-old
Kjetill Andre Aaamodt of Norway, who won the bronze medal with a
finish of 1:41.17.
</P>
<P>
   For Maier, known as the Herminator for his derring-do on skis,
victory Saturday was not crucial, but it was surely satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, I have now what I want,'' Maier said as he headed out
of his hotel Friday for a downhill training run. ``I have won a
gold medal in the world championships, and now for me, it is over.
If I win another medal in the downhill, then that is good too.''
</P>
<P>
   The results only added to Austria's dominance of this event. In
racing so far, the Austrian team _ both men and women _ have
captured seven of the 12 medals. The competition ends Feb. 14.
</P>
<P>
   The downhill course, known to be one of the toughest in the
world, was as hard as it gets Saturday. A cloud cover and light
snow cut down on visibility as a record crowd of about 2,100
onlookers rang bells, waved flags, and cheered their countrymen.
But on top of the hill, skiers shivered in a cutting wind as their
eyes surveyed a course of sheer ice and fall-away turns.
</P>
<P>
   Two American entries, Daron Rahlves, of Truckee, Calif., and
Paul Casey Puckett, of Crested Butte, Colo., both took massive
falls that sent them hurtling down the slope. Neither appeared to
suffer more than bumps and bruises, although Rahlves was taken to a
local hospital for a checkup.
</P>
<P>
   Maier rode the gates Saturday as if they were put there for him
to mow down.
</P>
<P>
   When other skiers fought gravity at The Brinks, a treacherous
section at the top of the course, Maier hugged the fall-line. On
the final jump at Golden Eagle, he soared as if shot from a
slingshot.
</P>
<P>
   Kjus, who skied right after Maier, made few mistakes. He knew he
had to match his World Cup rival's exacting performance.
</P>
<P>
   It is paradoxical somehow that the two top downhillers in the
world _ Maier and Kjus _ are known as much for their calamitous
free falls as for their masterful runs to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Maier, the bold Austrian, and Kjus, the demure Norwegian, have
survived tumbles on the slopes that might easily crush a lesser
mortal. Perhaps that's why neither seemed particularly unnerved by
prospects of the downhill race here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The pair shared a gold medal last Tuesday in the super-G
competition. With that came more reason to feel self-confident and
secure. It was an unprecedented outcome in a world championship _
that the two fastest racers would finish with the exact same time
to one-hundredths of a second.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For Kjus, talking about the short-haul seemed to work better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I know what the fast way down is,'' he said Friday of
the pending downhill. ``It is a difficult course. But it is quite
short, and once the top part is over, the last part is not so
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of these two champions, leaders in overall World
Cup points this season, that serious mishaps are left behind.
Forget Maier's chilling fall during the Olympic Games last Feb. 13
in Nagano, Japan. Like a boulder set loose from a cliff, he bounced
down a downhill course that stopped him only when the mountain had
had enough.
</P>
<P>
   As if to show the hill he wasn't about to be had, Maier went on
to win Olympic gold medals in the super-G and giant slalom.
</P>
<P>
   For Kjus, the bout with nature came during a World Cup race Jan.
12, 1996, in Kitzbuehel, Austria. Like a cannonball gone awry, Kjus
hurtled through space wondering if he would ever turn right side up
again. The accident left him with a severe concussion. But at the
time, it was just a sidebar to his ranking as overall World Cup
champion that year.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, the spill took its toll. It is only this
season that Kjus appears to be fully recovered.
</P>
<P>
   He was plagued with a neck strain through most of the 1997
season, then rallied somewhat last year with 10th overall in the
World Cup. He also won Olympic silver medals in the downhill and
the combined.
</P>
<P>
   For Maier, the lion in him still roars. Having moved into ski
racing in 1995 from life as a bricklayer, Maier has soared from No.
106 overall in 1996, to No. 1 last season on the World Cup circuit.
And this season so far, he is in the lead again.

   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ Catherine Walker knows crowds, especially
those in this pretty-as-a-picture town, and particularly when it
comes to its centerpiece, the red-brick structure that is the
Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, white-haired and with a smile as winning as Sammy
Sosa's, is the supervisor of attendance at the museum, and has
lived all her life in Cooperstown. She remembers distinctly the day
the Hall of Fame opened its doors, June 12, 1939, and held an
induction ceremony for 25 of the greatest players of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 8 years old,'' she said, ``and I remember Babe Ruth,
friendly as could be, walking down Main Street to the barber shop
for a haircut, and all the kids in town following him. It was quite
a crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   That was when baseball was uncontested as the most popular sport
in America. But times and circumstances change, and baseball has
been as susceptible to the fates as a windblown foul ball. In the
last few years, baseball had fallen on hard times, and the crowds
to the baseball shrine declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It began with the lockout and the shutting down of the World
Series in 1994,'' she recalled. ``Older people especially got sick
about it and turned away. But now things are different, especially
for the young people. I think Cal Ripken got it going when he was
breaking the longevity record in 1995, and then last year the
Yankees season and the McGwire-Sosa home run race. But the faith of
fans has been renewed. It's reflected in the crowds here. And you
see license plates from all over the country, from Texas and
California, and everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last quarter of 1998 _ in the months of October, November
and December, the Hall of Fame experienced record attendance with
37,542 going through the turnstiles in October, 14,017 in November
and 5,458 in December. Attendance in January declined because of 44
inches of snowfall in the area, according to Jeff Idelson, a
spokesman for the Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for the first time since 1993 _ the year before the
last lockout _ the Hall of Fame saw an increase in attendance. In
1993, the total attendance for the year was around 407,047, second
highest in history _ some 13,000 behind the record set in 1989.
This past year, the total attendance figure was 330,504 (through
Dec. 29), the seventh-highest in museum history, and a 16 percent
increase from the 1997 figure of 284,708.
</P>
<P>
   ``Activity at the museum was on the upswing all summer,''
Idelson said, ``but after what McGwire and Sosa did, and the
Yankees, it continued into the winter. The season was historic, and
I learned that people were coming here to get as close to history
as they could without actually having been there.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the visitors to the Hall recently was a 14-year-old named
Anthony Clarkson, who was wearing a red St. Louis Cardinals cap,
even though he lives in Dallas. He was accompanied by a cousin he
was visiting in Philadelphia, Jodie Findley, a sales manager for a
photo company, and a friend from Dallas, Jody Pruitt, also 14.
</P>
<P>
   They were looking over the exhibit that greets the visitor upon
entering the Hall. In three glass-encased exhibits are Roger Maris,
Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa memorabilia. Clarkson's attention was
drawn particularly to the baseball that McGwire hit for his 62d
homer last season, breaking Maris' all-time record of 61, the pair
of bats in which he hit most of his homers from No. 50 to No. 70,
as well as McGwire's red ankle-high baseball shoes
</P>
<P>
   ``I had always wanted to see the Hall of Fame,'' said Clarkson,
``and, yes, McGwire and Sosa heightened it even more for me.''
</P>
<P>
   His cousin, Jodie, said: ``We were really pumped to see the Hall
of Fame. We got up at 6 in the morning to drive up here from
Philadelphia _ took about five hours.''
</P>
<P>
   David Antell drove up from Waldwick, N.J., with his family, his
wife, Joy, and their three children, Jeremy Joseph, 11, Emerald, 4,
and Ayla, 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `Joseph' in Jeremy's name was for Shoeless Joe Jackson,''
said Antell, a wine consultant. ``We're big baseball fans, but
we've never been to the Hall of Fame before. We thought this would
be a good time to finally make the trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy said he was interested in ``the Babe Ruth stuff.'' But he
was also impressed with the Yankees' 1998 World Series trophy,
which is on loan to the museum until March, when it moves
permanently to the Yogi Berra Museum in Upper Montclair, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Down Main Street, about a block from the Hall of Fame, is a
memorabilia store named, ``Third Base: Last Stop Before Home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fuel's in the tank,'' said John Kurdziolek, owner of the
establishment. ``Business has increased dramatically, and of course
we're totally dependent on the Hall of Fame. We've seen the biggest
surge in years in the last several months. Our most popular item
has been Mark McGwire jerseys. We can't keep them in stock. We sold
150 to 200 in just a few months. We sold about 50 Sosa jerseys, but
remember, he was second to McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street is ``Mickey's Place: A baseball and sports
emporium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yankees are the big thing with our customers,'' said Jeff
Stevens, the proprietor. ``This last season stirred a lot of
excitement, but some of our biggest sales are still the old
Yankees. And the Joe DiMaggio autographed baseballs are probably
our hottest item at this time. It started when Joe got sick in the
fall, and these balls may be among the last he may ever sign.
Before this, the Mickey Mantle autographed ball sold for $350, and
the DiMaggio ball for $295. But the demand was so great for
DiMaggio that we raised the price twice, to $325 to $350.''
</P>
<P>
   There were also several Albert Belle baseball cards under glass.
How do those sell? ``They don't,'' said Stevens, in regard to the
notorious baseball curmudgeon. `
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at the museum, Anthony Clarkson, the youngster from
Dallas, was musing among the baseballs from the game's no-hitters,
including those of his idol, Nolan Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anthony said that the next time he comes here, it'll be for
his induction,'' said his cousin, Jodie Findley. She smiled.
``Well, it's America and it's baseball and anything is supposed to
be possible, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Which seems also to include a come-from-behind triumph, at this
time, for baseball, the Hall of Fame and the sale of Mark McGwire
jerseys.

On this occasion, he was standing near the goal post and throwing
footballs at the balls that sailed past, end over end. Try that

the moving targets 30 feet above. The moment captured the whimsy,

 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Looking up from her morning exertions on a stationary
bicycle, Rena Kahn gave the famous young woman on the television
screen a cool, but not unsympathetic, appraisal.
</P>
<P>
   ``She seems like she's really in control, like they prepped her
really well,'' said Ms. Kahn, nodding toward the videotaped image
of Monica Lewinsky playing on the set hanging above her exercise
machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``But whoever does her hair, well, I don't know,'' she said.
``And the poor thing has really ballooned up.''
</P>
<P>
   At a reporter's request, the Senate trial, instead of the
customary sports programming, was displayed on every television in
the cardio room of the Synergy Fitness Club in midtown Manhattan.
But Ms. Lewinsky's voice was barely audible over the sound of
pounding feet and labored breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Her television debut _ talking, smiling, biting her lip and
sometimes pausing with a contemplative glance skyward as she
pondered questions from the House impeachment managers _ elicited
some compassion, if only fleeting interest.
</P>
<P>
   But seeing was the thing, because few people had caught sight of
the former White House intern over the last year except as a frozen
image in a newspaper photograph, a fast-moving figure ducking into
a limousine or caught, in an often-replayed moment, wearing a
jaunty black beret and reaching up to give President Clinton a hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very sad, in a way, that we're seeing this,'' said Ms.
Kahn, the director of international business at Deloitte &AMP; Touche,
as she watched a snippet of Ms. Lewinsky's testimony. ``We already
know all the details.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the health club patrons stared out the wall of windows
onto Park Avenue or pointedly ignored the televisions as they read
books or lost themselves in the music of their portable
audiocassette players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather watch something else,'' conceded Charles Wimer,
a lawyer and regional manager of Fidelity National Title Insurance
Co. of New York, as he jogged earnestly on a treadmill. But he
watched the trial anyway, expressing surprise at Ms. Lewinsky's
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought she'd look better,'' he said. ``For a young kid, she
doesn't look good to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Wimer said he feels some sympathy for the young woman. ``I
always thought, from the accounts I read, that this was not an
innocent kid,'' he said. ``But the fact is, he's powerful and she's
the one who has to stand up and testify while he stays in the White
House and has his cronies cover for him.''
</P>
<P>
   While he did not expect to be watching the impeachment trial
while exercising at Synergy, Wimer said he would happily watch Ms.
Lewinsky telling her story in her own words in a less formal
setting. ``That, everybody will watch,'' he said. ``Everybody is
anxious to hear what she has to say without being in a judicial
atmosphere, when she's a lot more relaxed and not under
cross-examination.''
</P>
<P>
   As he built up speed on his stationary bicycle, Michael Prince,
34, a reporter for Business Insurance magazine, watched Ms.
Lewinsky parry a few questions from her congressional
interrogators. He said she impressed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see some life in her, a little snappy something,'' he
said, adding that she was ``not a ditzy Californian as many people
have made her out to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Durando, a publishing company executive who was
maintaining a punishing pace on his treadmill, below a row of
televisions, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She looks better than she first did when she became a public
figure,'' he said. ``She's had a little help with her personal
look. The hair's still big, but it's under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the room, Rona Siegel kept her eyes on the screen as she
pushed and pulled and strained on a cross-training machine. Ms.
Siegel was once an agent for fashion models and evaluated Ms.
Lewinsky's appearance, and imagined her inner life, with a
professional's dispassionate cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica looks good,'' she said. ``She puts herself together
well, but what she did was unrealistic. How many 50-year-old men
are going to leave success and power and go off with a
24-year-old?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Siegel, who now owns Tatoo Fotography Management in
Manhattan, said she also found Ms. Lewinsky ``very composed'' in
the witness chair. ``By now she's been interviewed 25 times, so
after awhile it doesn't intimidate you anymore,'' she observed.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Siegel, with her experience handling teen-age girls and
models no older than Ms. Lewinsky was when she met the president,
also said she was not fooled by composure, a mature wardrobe and a
well-coifed head.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that age, you're young emotionally,'' she added. ``I used
to send 15- and 16-year-old girls around the world. They think they
know what they're doing, but they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   A young woman pounding away on a treadmill, who said her name
was Lauren but refused to give her last name, took a different
tack. Ms. Lewinsky's black suit and string of pearls were pretty,
she said, though her circumstances were not.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's just a girl who fell in love with her boss,'' Lauren
said, resolutely running in place. ``He just happens to be the most
powerful man in the world.''

METS COACH MOONLIGHTS BY CHANGING HIS STRIPES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most baseball players and coaches spend the off season playing
golf or hunting or fishing. Or making the rounds on the banquet
circle.
</P>
<P>
   Not Bruce Benedict. If you want to find the Mets' bench coach
from November to the middle of this month, he is most likely in a
college town somewhere down South refereeing a basketball game. He
has made whistle stops in the bigs of the Southeastern Conference
and in the boondocks of the National Association for
Intercollegiate Athletics. And he has probably stayed in more
hotels than Willy Loman.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Benedict has refereed games from Syracuse to
Miami to California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've kind of touched all the spots,'' Benedict said.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict regularly works games in the SEC, the Ohio Valley and
Trans America Conferences, the Division II Peach Belt Conference,
the Division III Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference and NAIA
District 27.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, his schedule took him through a veritable
glossary of Tennessee towns _ Clarksville (Belmont at Austin Peay),
Cooksville (Murray State at Tennessee Tech), Monteagle (DePauw at
the University of the South) and Knoxville (Alabama at Tennessee).
</P>
<P>
   Then last week, Benedict's tour had him visiting three states in
six days, from Alabama on Monday (Talladega College) to Tennessee
on Tuesday (Tennessee-Martin) and Nashville on Wednesday
(Vanderbilt against Georgia), to Florida on Saturday, when Florida
was host to Mississippi in Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a person that likes to stay busy,'' Benedict said. ``This
enables me to stay in a competitive environment all year long.''
</P>
<P>
   And how. And once Benedict dons the black and white vertical
stripes of the referee uniform, gone is the anonymity of being a
bench coach, a job he has held with the Mets the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, I tell people I didn't realize how bad a baseball
player I was until I started refereeing,'' said Benedict, a former
catcher, who played from 1978 to 1989 with the Atlanta Braves. ``At
basketball games, people were close enough to talk where I could
start hearing it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Benedict began refereeing basketball games at the high
school and junior high levels, along with some junior college
games, while he was still catching for the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that took some guts, to play like I was playing at the end
of my career,'' Benedict said.
</P>
<P>
   By 1990, he was doing Division I college games. This is his
eighth season as an SEC referee. He has done games this season at
Kentucky and Auburn, two of the top-ranked teams in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's two different worlds, really,'' Benedict said of his
summer and winter jobs. ``With the Mets, I'm at the top level of
pro sports. Then I go back to another level. It's a great fit for
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I root for the Mets all year long, and then I go to the
colleges and could absolutely care less who wins.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There is one major adjustment Benedict must make however.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is in baseball, you go into a town for three or
four days and check into a nice hotel,'' Benedict said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In basketball, it's a one-game series. There are three things
about college basketball that are very tough. One, getting to the
game. Two, doing the game. And three, getting to the next game.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the problems Benedict has faced have been
weather-related. Ice storms. Plane troubles. He said he has never
missed a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've been running in, changing clothes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest part with doing so many games at so many different
levels may be having to adjust to the different talent levels and
knowing what to call _ and what not to _ based on the players'
skills in places from Rupp Arena to a small college gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have to remember is that although places vary in size
and people, these games _ especially the in-conference ones _ mean
just as much to NAIA schools and their players, coaches and fans as
they do to a Georgia or a Vanderbilt,'' Benedict said. ``Obviously,
the skill level is different. But that's part of your development
as an official.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, as long as Benedict has a job in the major
leagues, he can develop only so far. By the time the conference and
national tournaments roll around, Benedict is at spring training.
His March madness is spent in Port St. Lucie, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Benedict will just have to satisfy himself with
watching it on television, as he does every spring. He insists he
does not enter any NCAA pools.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when the players are filling out their sheets, I tell them
I am available for consultation purposes,'' Benedict said. ``For a
small fee, of course.''

MONICA LEWINSKY STARS IN VIDEOTAPE DEBUT AT CLINTON TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Videotapes rolled at the Senate impeachment trial
Saturday as senators and the American public saw Monica Lewinsky
for the first time tell her now-familiar story of sex,
job-searching and a false affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   There were no dramatic revelations during the six hours of
arguments and video, and the Senate appeared headed for an
almost-certain vote to acquit President Clinton later this week on
the two impeachment articles charging perjury and obstruction of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the public debut of Lewinsky on videotape
dominated the proceeding as senators and the American public saw a
poised young lady talk about her relationship with the president of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on four large TV monitors set up in the Senate
chamber, Lewinsky appeared calm and composed, wearing a string of
pearls and a dark top, her lips glossed pink. She punctuated her
sentences by brushing her black, helmet-like hair off her face or
flicking it back with a shake of her head.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, asked about her response to presidential confidant
Vernon Jordan's suggestion that her ``problem'' was she was in love
with Clinton, Lewinksy flashed an embarrassed smile and said: ``I
probably blushed or giggled or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about how she felt about Clinton now, Lewinsky said, ``I
have mixed feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors used Lewinsky's testimony and that of
presidential confidant Vernon Jordan and White House aide Sidney
Blumenthal to bolster their case that the president lied in his
August 19, 1998, grand jury appearance about his affair with
Lewinsky, and obstructed justice by encouraging her to file a false
affidavit in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Lewinsky's statement that Clinton didn't ask her to lie
and that there were no explicit promises of a job in exchange for
her silence, the testimony of Lewinsky, Clinton and others taken
together shows how Clinton ``wove a web of perjury and
obstruction,'' as prosecutor Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., put it.
Rogan was her main questioner at the videotaped deposition last
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors zeroed in on Clinton's 2 a.m. phone call to Lewinsky
on Dec. 17, 1997, when he informed her that her name had come up on
the witness list faxed to the White House by Jones' lawyers.
Clinton also suggested Lewinsky could sign an affidavit to avoid
testifying.
</P>
<P>
   The video showed Lewinsky being asked about Clinton's suggestion
she could say her frequent Oval Office trips were to see
presidential secretary Betty Currie or bring Clinton letters.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky said she had heard those words before. Secrecy and
denial, she said, ``was part of the pattern of the relationship ...
I knew I would deny the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky ultimately signed an affidavit denying the relationship
on Jan. 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also a videotape excerpt showing Lewinsky recalling
that Currie called her on Dec. 28, 1997, and saying she would drive
by Lewinsky's apartment to pick up a package.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume (Currie) meant the gifts,'' Lewinsky said, referring
to gifts she had received from Clinton that were being sought by
Jones' lawyers. Currie retrieved the gifts and stashed them under
her bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way the Betty Currie could know to come and get the
gifts was the president telling her to do so,'' Rogan said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also focused on Jordan's claim that at a critical
juncture in December 1997 Clinton didn't tell him that Lewinsky's
name was on the witness list.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said ``it would have been helpful'' to have this
information as he dialed influential corporate friends in high
places to find Lewinsky a job.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said he did not learn that Lewinsky was on the Jones
witness list until Dec. 19, 1997 _ 13 days after Clinton first
learned it.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors argue Clinton and Jordan intensified the job
search for Lewinsky that month in order to keep her from telling
the truth about her affair with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's legal team argued that Lewinsky's testimony ``is so
clear, it exonerates the president,'' as one of the lawyers, Nicole
Seligman, put it.
</P>
<P>
   In excerpts played by the White House legal team, Lewinsky
recalls Clinton suggesting in the Dec. 17, 1997, phone call that
she could sign an affidavit, but she insisted: ``There was no
discussion of what would be in the affidavit.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she understood the implication of filing a false
affidavit, Lewinsky responded: ``I don't think I necessarily
thought at that point that it would have to be false.'' That
accords with Clinton's contention that he believed Lewinsky could
sign a truthful affidavit denying a sexual relationship because
they had not had sexual intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   Senate reaction to the videos ranged the spectrum of party
affiliation and political conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was deja vu all over again,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt., who sat in on all the depositions.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors are ``making the best case they can, but
there's nothing new in the videos,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., accused House prosecutors of
changing their theory of the impeachment case against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've gone from a conspiracy theory to `No one knew, but the
president,''' Boxer said, referring to Lewinsky's denial of
pressure on the affidavit and Jordan saying the president failed to
tell him about Lewinsky's name on the Jones witness list as he
searched for a job for her in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very strange theory,'' Boxer said. ``If nobody felt any
pressure, nobody made any connections, what happened? Nothing. I
think (prosecutors) hurt themselves badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans, however, were impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've heard is devastating to the White House,'' said Sen.
Larry Craig, R-Idaho. ``Now we know why the White House fought to
the bitter end on disallowing those videotapes... once you bring
all those personalities together, the story becomes complete.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig continued: ``The president didn't tell (Lewinsky) to lie,
but she obviously understood that she was to tell a story that was
a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig said Lewinsky at last had deflated White House attempts to
smear her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American public could see Monica Lewinsky for the first
time as Monica Lewinsky. Is she a stalker today? No. Is she a
predator? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Craig acknowledged, ``I don't expect the American
people to move 20 or 30 points today'' because of the videos.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., said he felt the videos were
``very powerful,'' and that Lewinsky ``came across as very straight
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, outside the Senate chamber during breaks, senators
batted the idea of a censure resolution back and forth with little
evidence they were close to agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tapping into that emotion should be fairly easy,'' said Sen.
Robert Bennett, R-Utah, who has worked with Sen. Dianne Feinstein,
D-Calif., to come up with bipartisan agreement on a censure
resolution. ``But finding the right set of words that can get
everyone in general agreement on the same idea is not so easy.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted between 60 and 80 votes for censure.
</P>
<P>
   Other senators, particularly conservative Republicans, said they
were dead set against censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a pat on the butt saying `Go home, you bad boy,'''
said Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, said censure would set a ``bad
precedent'' for the future. ``What the American people want us to
do is get back to our business,'' DeWine said. ``People will be
shocked if an hour or a day after an up-or-down vote on
impeachment, we are back in the U.S. Senate debating the
president's conduct...It is not the job of the U.S. Congress to
punish the president.''

GOLF BUSINESS HASN'T BENEFITED FROM TIGER WOODS AS MUCH AS IT
THOUGHT IT WOULD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the Tiger Woods era is off to a rocky start for many in
America's golf business, most Kansas City area golf enterprises
seem to be faring reasonably well. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's at the national or local level, however, one thing
seems certain: Tiger's explosive arrival on the scene created
business expectations that were too high. Conversations with area
golf course and golf shop operators lead to a couple of
conclusions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The overall level of golf activity hereabouts has been good but
not great since Tiger turned pro, but those who anticipated a burst
of equipment sales growth have been disappointed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's happening locally is occurring against an industrywide
backdrop of discouraging developments. The equipment industry is a
disaster area. Some well-known names have failed and the stock
price of most survivors has plunged. Meanwhile, many course
operators are complaining that the new-venue glut is harder to deal
with than a 600-yard par-five hole playing against the wind. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the late '80s a National Golf Foundation study concluded the
industry needed to develop a golf course a day for a decade to keep
up with the rise in players. It was generally considered an
impossible challenge, but it happened. Unfortunately, golfing
population growth has lagged predictions and is now about 26
million. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if Tigermania didn't exist, though. Many adults with
no previous interest in golf now watch golf on television if Tiger
is in the hunt. More significant, however, is how everyone in the
business raves about the explosion of youngsters taking to golf. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Queen, manager of golf course operations for Overland
Park, calls the increase in junior golfers at his courses
``phenomenal.'' Jeff Johnson, head professional at Sunflower Hills
in Wyandotte County, is seeing a similar trend out his way, where
junior golf ``has just gone crazy.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the state line, Pat Zuk, head professional
at Kansas City's Swope Memorial, also sees more junior golfers.
Many of them are being introduced to the game at the Blue River
Golf Academy, which was established to introduce urban youngsters
to golf. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Marquardt, director of golf operations at Paradise Point
golf complex in Smithville, attributes much of local golf's
relative health to Kansas City's being ``very affordable.''
Paradise Point, Marquardt said, expanded from 18 to 36 holes
several years ago because of the rising demand for group events. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marquardt also is proud of how he's sustained his golf shop
sales, which some course operators have de-emphasized. He's done
it, he says, by focusing more on corporate customers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in equipment sales is as upbeat, however. Jack
Davis, owner of a well-known Lenexa golf shop for nearly 25 years,
says last year was his softest year since '78. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is kind of like being in the oil business,'' he said.
Much of the problem, he believes, is the trend toward more
expensive high-tech clubs, which prompts golfers to delay new
purchases. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The consensus is that Tigermania's full economic impact is at
least 10 years away, until today's juniors become working adults
and start generating the income needed to buy costly new
equipment. &QL;

 VISIT TO JESSE JAMES COUNTRY IS ENGlISHMAN'S DREAM COME TRUE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE POPPER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At 11:30 a.m. Tuesday, Jesse Tonks, who has lived his entire
life in the heart of England's industrial Midlands, walked through
the doors of the historic Jesse James Home in St. Joseph to view
the spot where the famous outlaw died. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I've waited 55 years for this moment,'' Tonks said. ``This
place is part of my family tradition.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That tradition, an odd one as you shall see, has been passed
from Tonks to Tonks since 1882. It has persisted for almost 117
years despite the fact that not a single Tonks, living or dead,
ever met Jesse James or, for that matter, knew much about him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to think he was from Texas,'' said Tonks, 65, who
retired last year as an oil rig inspector. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And though Tonks has done a good bit of on-the-job traveling _
43 countries in all _ he had never set foot in Missouri before last
week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've been trying to get here for most of my life,'' he
said. ``It's been my dream.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That long-held hope began to come true in December when Tonks
entered a dream-trip contest titled ``Places to Remember,''
sponsored by the London Daily Express, which is nationally
distributed in Britain. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tonks' entry letter so intrigued the Express editors that they
plucked him from Midlands obscurity, declared him a winner and
quickly made arrangements to send him to the heart of Jesse James
country: Kansas City and St. Joseph. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The contest is to celebrate the upcoming millennium,'' said
Jay Iliff, a feature writer for the Express who accompanied Tonks
on his American journey. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked our readers to write us about the places they most
wanted to go and why. We're awarding 52 trips this year and
featuring one each week in the paper.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since the contest began, the Express has been flooded with
strange and moving tales. In fact, said Iliff, he arrived in
Missouri hard on the heels of a trip to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia,
with another contest winner. There, 35 years ago, as an infant, the
winner accidentally had been tossed into a monsoon drain and then
dramatically rescued. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the sort of thing we're after,'' Iliff said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tonks, though, almost missed his great opportunity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never won a thing in my life,'' he told his family when
they urged him to enter the national contest. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, go on, Dad,'' said his daughter Susan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reluctantly, then, Tonks took pen in hand. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I am named after Jesse James, the outlaw,'' he began. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He added that his father before him was named Jesse, as are his
own son and several nephews. All in honor of Jesse James. And so,
he concluded, he wanted more than anything to visit Missouri and
finally see for himself what this long Tonks tradition was about. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His entry letter stirred immediate interest at the Express. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``All these generations of Jesses in the middle of England, and
all named after a notorious American outlaw,'' said Iliff. ``Well,
that would catch your eye, wouldn't it?'' &QL; 
The Tonkses' long and emotional connection to Jesse James began
with a man named Jack Barnes, who was Jesse Tonks' maternal
great-uncle. Barnes was afflicted with an incurable wanderlust that
led him first to sea and eventually to the center of America. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the Midlands town of Nuneaton whence he came _ and where he
is remembered still _ Barnes' traveling ways achieved legendary
status. People there called him the ``Pennsylvanian Tramp.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``With a name like that, I suppose he must have spent a lot of
time in Pennsylvania,'' said Tonks. ``But I have no idea why.

   (no idea why.'')
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Barnes eventually drifted westward in America and
happened to be in St. Joseph on April 3, 1882, the day Jesse James
was killed. Such stunning proximity to a historic event proved
irresistible to the folks at home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack Barnes came back for a visit that very year,'' said
Tonks. ``My family were all farm laborers in those days, and except
for the Pennsylvanian Tramp, none of them ever got more than five
miles from home. Well, a story like that, it would be exciting to
them, wouldn't it? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, my grandfather was so thrilled by it that he named
his own son Jesse. And that son was my father, who became a
professional footballer (soccer player) and bookmaker. And he named
me Jesse, too. I first learned the reason from my dad and my Uncle
Tom when I was 10. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad and my uncle were great drinking companions _ with the
beer, like _ and one time when they were drinking together, they
told me the whole story. It intrigued me so much that I've wanted
to visit Missouri ever since.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This Tonksian obsession has thrived through generations _ until
now, that is. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In all there have been four Tonkses named Jesse. The fifth was
supposed to be Tonks' first grandson. But his daughter-in-law
rebelled and named the boy Ashley James instead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that certainly broke the chain, didn't it?,'' said
Tonks' wife, Margaret, who was born in Scotland. ``But that's the
youngsters for you, isn't it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Jesse and Margaret Tonks finally entered the James Home, they
were greeted by Gary Chilcote, the museum director and one of the
world's foremost James authorities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Come in here, where Jesse actually stood when he was killed,''
Chilcote said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Almost reverently, the Tonkses walked together into the parlor
where the deed was done. Jesse Tonks quickly noted the framed
needlepoint sampler that James was supposedly straightening at the
moment he was shot in the back of the head. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, there are two stories about that,'' Chilcote said.
``One is that Jesse was straightening the picture frame, the other
is that he was dusting it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I don't think the dust would come into it at all,'' said
Margaret Tonks. ``I can't see a famous outlaw like that doing much
dusting.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chilcote nodded as he led the way into an adjoining room where
the results of the 1995 exhumation of James' body are on exhibit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Over here,'' he said, ``you can see Jesse's head twisting
slowly in the wind.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to a perfectly cast reproduction of James' skull. The
32 pieces of skull bone found in the outlaw's coffin were
duplicated and reassembled during the study. They are now displayed
on a rotating pedestal. The fatal bullet's entry path is marked by
a bright orange tube. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantastic, that,'' said Jesse Tonks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In front of the skull there are re-creations of James' teeth
cast from the originals. (All that actually remained of James was
ceremonially reburied after the 1995 study was completed.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to a museum placard, the flattened surfaces of James'
molars resulted either from low-grade tobacco or ``perhaps a
lifestyle that caused him to grit his teeth a lot.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Brilliant!'' Tonks murmured, staring hard at the skull and the
flat-surfaced teeth as he brushed from his cheek what seemed to be
a tear. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor old Jess gets a bit emotional about this,'' said Peter
Corns, an Express photographer, or ``snapper'' as they're often
called in England. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday we were at the James farm in Kearney,'' Corns added,
``and when Jess was thanking everyone for what they'd done for him,
a little tear crept into the old eye, you know.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While in Kearney, Tonks laid a wreath on Jesse James' grave and
posed for a photograph wearing a broad-brimmed Stetson. That
picture was much on his mind as he finished his Missouri sojourn. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the Royal Navy, and I belong to an ex-serviceman's
club at home,'' he said. ``And I just know I'm going to have the
Mickey taken out of me when my friends see me in a cowboy hat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But I know what I'll say in return. I'll tell them: `I've been
to Missouri. I've seen where Jesse James was born and died. Where
have you been?' '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before Tonks left St. Joseph to begin his journey home, he
explained what finally happened to the Pennsylvanian Tramp. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he died in Canada during the 1930s,'' Tonks said. ``He
died a wealthy man. Apparently he struck gold in the Yukon.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the fabled Midlands hobo left no will and had no birth
certificate, so his fortune went to the Canadian government. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end we got only his story,'' Tonks said. ``But it's a
good story, isn't it?'' &QL;

 &HT;    JORDANIANS WAIT FOR THE LIKELY BAD NEWS ABOUT THEIR KING HUSSEIN
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ As King Hussein lay in his hospital under
sedation and on a respirator, Jordanians slowly began acknowledging
the bad news that will likely end their monarch's grave struggle
with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning, the Jordanian cabinet, declaring Hussein unfit
for office, renewed the authority of his first son Crown Prince
Abdullah bin Hussein, over the country. Abdullah was in charge
during the five days of ill-fated cancer treatment that Hussein,
63, underwent in Minnesota last week. But this is the first time in
Hussein's 47-year reign that he has been relieved of his duties
while he was in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer of power, in all likelihood, brought an end to the
rule of King Hussein. He has been a force for peace and stability
in a region cursed by turbulence and has consulted with every U.S.
president since Dwight Eisenhower. The torch was passed to his
37-year-old Abdullah, considered capable but inexperienced.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign embassies from other Arab states said their leaders were
preparing to head to Jordan for an expected funeral, and advance
teams from the United States were clearing the way for a visit from
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In the sparse office of Jordan's ministry for Islamic sites and
affairs(CQ. formal name includes an esoteric Arabic word), a
bureaucrat and long-time friend of Hussein's agonized over another
issue -- whether he would be among the religious officials called
to determine whether the medical treatment for Hussein could be
ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a desperate case,'' said Hamdi Murad, a top religious
government official who has often given Islamic advice to the royal
family. ``We are on standby.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it would likely be up to Abdullah, as first son and heir
to the throne, to make the final decision on Hussein's treatment.
According to Islam, Murad said, life-support machines were similar
to medicine and must be employed as long as there is even just a
remote chance of recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the official information about Hussein's status came in
a four-sentence statement from his chief physician. It said Hussein
was on a respirator because he has trouble breathing and that he
was ``under sedation.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement said his heart and brain were ``intact'' and that
his condition was stable. His only kidney -- the other was removed
in cancer treatment in 1992 -- and liver have stopped functioning.
</P>
<P>
   Also, it was confirmed that Hussein has been unconscious since
hours before he was put on his airplane to return from Minnesota
Thursday, when doctors said a bone marrow transplant had failed. He
suffers from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph glands.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's ambassador to the United States, Marwan Muasher, told
Jordanian television that, on the return trip from Minnesota, Queen
Noor allowed the family members and close staff on board to each
sit for a few moments alone with the unconscious king.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, there was a process underway to prepare the Jordanian
people for the shock of their first transition of power in nearly
half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, a poor country of just 4.4 million people, has often
been threatened by invasions and wars among its neighbors --
primarily Israel to the west and Iraq to the east. Hussein, whose
picture hangs in nearly every store and many homes, was seen as the
country's savior from such threats, as a well as pro-western,
moderating, force on the whole region.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Jordanian press, heavily influenced by the government,
one newspaper wrote about Hussein as if his death was imminent and
another, the English-language Jordan Times, quoted an unnamed
government official saying Hussein wanted to be among his people
and was in a coma.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Noor left her husband's side long enough to emerge from
the King Hussein Medical Center to meet a shocked a crowd of
several hundred of her subjects who have been keeping a constant
vigil there. There was near mayhem as people tried to get close to
the queen and several of the Hussein's sons.
</P>
<P>
   The vigil seemed to be the site of the last diehards, still
holding out hope that Hussein could survive.
</P>
<P>
   At the time for evening prayers, one of the five prayer times
each day in Islam, about 40 men who had spent the night in cars and
the cold rain outside the medical center kneeled to pray for
Hussein. Many wore the red-and-white checkered head scarfs of
Bedoiun tradition and had come from about 80 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is our life. Please give him health,'' prayer leader Sheikh
Khaled Mohammed Alghan called out to Allah. ``You are the one who
gives life and death . . . the machines cannot save him and the
heart is weak. Please give him life.''

RANGERS ADOPT DEFENSIVE POSTURE ON SPRING FEVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The swamp buggies are gassed up and ready to roll. In a mere 10
days, pitchers and catchers will join the alligators at Charlotte
County Stadium. Spring training is nearly here for the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to winter? Winter seems like a blur. And
winter was definitely a blank, at least for the grandiose plan of
adding Randy Johnson or Roger Clemens to the city of Arlington tax
roll.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Rangers whiffed on the No. 1 off-season priority.
Didn't get Johnson, didn't get Clemens, didn't get done what needed
to be done. So why not raise ticket prices? So they did. I hate it
when I have to whine like this. But it's the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Then again.
</P>
<P>
   In most other baseball locales, they actually gaze with envy
upon the local baseball situation. For example, San Diego, where a
World Series team has been dismantled this winter, all in the name
of cost-cutting. And this came even after taxpayers went to the
polls and approved in November the financing of one of those
get-rich-now new stadiums for Padres' ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, go to the bottom of the financial batting order in
baseball, and you will find, among many, the Kansas City Royals.
That team sold recently for $75 million. How do you explain this
winter to those fans that Kevin Brown ($105 million), Mike Piazza
($91 million), Bernie Williams ($87.5 million) and Mo Vaughn ($80
million) have suddenly become worth more than your entire
franchise?
</P>
<P>
   And while mumbling over no Johnson or Clemens in the Rangers'
rotation is legitimate, it's also a bit muffled since concerted
effort by management was never a question.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hicks is a newcomer to baseball, but an experienced hand at
putting together billion-dollar corporate deals. When Johnson
decided to sign with Arizona, all Hicks could do was smile and say,
``I've never heard of a business where you offer a guy $12 million
a year and he turns you down.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Johnson rejection, and after Toronto waffled on
trading Clemens, general manager Doug Melvin signed Mark Clark and
Mike Morgan for the rotation, and then handed over the keys to
manager Johnny Oates. Hoping for a Mercedes, Oates ended up with a
Ford (Clark) and a Studebaker (the 39-year old Morgan).
</P>
<P>
   Except, as expected, Oates was driving home the opposite point
when the Rangers hosted a media gathering Friday at The Ballpark in
Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have come out of the winter with a much better rotation,
and better overall pitching,'' he said, attempting to shoot down
the theory of no Johnson, no Clemens, no improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Know why?'' added Oates. ``Because of Rafael Palmeiro's Gold
Glove at first, Mark McLemore's health at second, a full season
with Royce Clayton at short, a solid Todd Zeile at third, a forever
Gold Glover (Pudge Rodriguez) behind the plate, two very underrated
defensive players at the outfield corners (Rusty Greer and Juan
Gonzalez) and Tom Goodwin's speed in center.''
</P>
<P>
   You see, of course, where Oates is going with this.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stunk on defense last season ... flat stunk,'' said Oates,
frowning at the memory. ``This is the most improved area of this
team. This will make our pitching much better. Last season, we
couldn't catch a cold in flu season. I had no problem with our
pitching, it was our defense I hated.''
</P>
<P>
   Such optimism about the rotation can obviously be debated. But
there's also no denying the defensive shortcomings of '98, which
were severe. The free-agent signing of Palmeiro is a huge upgrade
over Will Clark at first base, and also in the batting order. And
once Clayton arrived in August, he played the most consistent
shortstop in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   But back to the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many Roger Clemens and Randy Johnsons are there?'' said
Oates. ``One of each. They are true No. 1s. None of our five guys
will be true No. 1s. But none are fives either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will score our runs, we will play good defense, and we will
have a rotation that gives us innings and keeps us in ballgames.
I'll take my chances with that. Anytime.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Helling, Aaron Sele, Clark and John Burkett are set for
that rotation. The fifth member will either be Esteban Loaiza or
Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Is that enough to again win the American League West? Maybe. Is
that enough to overcome something like the Yankees in the
postseason? Heavens no.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait and see,'' answered Oates.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I think I will.

   JORDAN-HUSSEIN-0207 _ AMMAN, Jordan _ As the hour-by-hour vigil
over the gravely ill body of this country's monarch continued for a
second day, a profound question has arisen: How does Islamic law _
one of the most strict of all religions _ deal with removing
someone from life support? Although the family of Jordan's King
Hussein decided late Friday night to leave him on life support _
for now _ it did not come without some reportedly heated debate
among those members. Developing. (Kaplow, Cox News Service) MOVED

illegal immigrants have come ashore in South Florida in recent
weeks. And, overall, there's been a 400 percent increase in illegal
immigrants nabbed on Florida shores over the past year. Most of the
immigrants are coming from Cuba and Haiti. Experts say the dramatic

overcrowd U.S. schools and strain government services. (Emling, Cox

   w/IMPEACH-SCENE _ WASHINGTON _ The thought that may have
lingered in the minds of many Americans as they watched the
unfolding saga of Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky came to this:
The president of the United States is 52 years old. His partner in
history's most famous extramarital relationship is 25. This is well
known. But never before had Americans seen and heard Lewinsky. When
they did, the disparity in age and power between Clinton and

   TELECOM _ WASHINGTON _ Feb. 8 marks the third anniversary of the
Telecommunications Act. In 1996, after years of haggling, weary
lawmakers put finishing touches on the massive act, intended to
give consumers more choices and drive prices downward. That hasn't
happened: Today, not a single Baby Bell has been given the green
light to move into long-distance markets. Consumers haven't
benefitted either. Telephone prices have kept pace with inflation,
but they haven't been reduced as promised. And cable rates have
soared at an estimated 7 percent per year. What's more, the telecom
landscape has shifted dramatically. Telephone, cable and wireless
companies are in a frenzy to position themselves for the great
Internet race. The dizzying speed of developments has left
lawmakers and regulators grappling with how to regulate an industry
that is changing more quickly than rules can be written. (Regan,

for serving on corporate boards (Marriott, Delta, Archer-Daniels

consulting for select American corproations such as Chevron. He's
living out a seeming contradiction: the pastor/human rights

   GIST _ Virginia planter Samuel Gist wrote a utopian provision
into his will in 1808. He directed that his 300 slaves be freed
upon his death and his plantation turned into a sort of freedman
commune. But his last wishes collided with Commonwealth law, which
required that freed slaves leave the state. After much legal
wrangling following Gist's 1815 death, Virginia courts created an
alternate plan. They set up three ``settlements'' for the Gist
slaves in Ohio. Today, only one Gist settlement remains, in
Highland County _ and it's a legal quagmire. Several families of
descendants of the Gist slaves still live on the land, but none of
them has been able to acquire any of the land. For many years, it
was uncertain who was responsible for ever-escalating back taxes.
To prevent the settlement from being sold at sheriff's sale, slave
descendant Paul Turner, who has been farming much of the land for
25 years, agreed to pay taxes on land he doesn't own. Now, Turner
is trying to get title to his land, as is Charles Peacock, who owns
a junkyard on settlement land and who filed a civil lawsuit against
the county in 1996. ``There wouldn't have been a Gist settlement if
I hadn't come back here and paid the taxes,'' Turner said. ``I'd
like to keep it the Gist settlement because I know what the people
went through who came here.'' (Beyerlein, Dayton daily News) MOVED

night club in Los Angeles. A Catholic school in Indianapolis. All

50 GAMES WITHOUT JORDAN NOT A BAD THING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't look now, but NBA owners and players have stumbled onto an
unlikely potion breathing life into their previously comatose
league:
</P>
<P>
   The lockout and Michael Jordan's retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of positive fallout produced by those two
seemingly negative events, the NBA opened its irregular season this
weekend amidst an almost unprecedented buzz.
</P>
<P>
   The lockout lopped off 32 meaningless games, forced a
headline-grabbing free-agent period, and moved players to interact
positively with the fans who pay their salaries.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jordan's departure, it gave hope to 28 teams previously
harmless in the shadow of the Bulls' dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a shorter season players won't get burned out and fans
won't get burned out,'' Heat coach Pat Riley said. ``With Michael
gone it's anybody's championship, and with every game being so
important, it's going to be very exciting, very competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the league should get a clue and make Feb. 1 the
start of the 50-game regular season from now on.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody cares about NBA games in November or December anyway, and
82 is just too many. What do league officials boasting the ``every
game is important in a 50-game season'' mantra say before next
season's return to 82? ``Aw, some of these games will be important,
some won't''?
</P>
<P>
   By virtue of their own incompetence, the NBA has fallen into the
successful blueprint: a two-week training camp/free-agency period
at the end of January, two free exhibition games, a 50-game regular
season starting Feb. 1 (after the NFL and before major league
baseball), league-wide parity, and the normal six-week playoff run.
If you must have an All-Star Weekend, move it to mid-March, just
before the NCAA's Madness.

   ``I think our image had been suffering, unrelated to the work
stoppage,'' NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik said. ``Having gone
through it, I do believe \Rthe lockout\S will restore better
relations between management and the players, and both of them with
the fans. I think players have come to realize how important that
connection is. Maybe, long term, the lockout actually will have
some benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jordan/lockout mixture is giving us young stars like the
Lakers' Kobe Bryant re-signing with their teams, previously aloof
players like the Blazers' Isaiah Rider staying after practice to
sign autographs, and veterans like 37-year-old Derek Harper playing
one more season in hopes of finally winning a ring.
</P>
<P>
   It gave us clear-cut villains like the Celtics' Kenny Anderson
(who complained about struggling to pay insurance on his nine
cars), the Heat's Alonzo Mourning (who said he didn't care if fans
understood what he called the players' financial strife) and Kurt
Thomas (who reneged on his word to the Mavericks to take more money
with the Knicks). It also gave us heroes like the Nets' Jayson
Williams (who donated $20,000 to arena employees after signing his
$100 million deal), Tom Gugliotta (who turned down almost $30
million to sign with the Suns over the Timberwolves), and the Suns'
Danny Manning (attempting to become the first professional athlete
to return from three reconstructive knee surgeries).
</P>
<P>
   Apathetic during the lockout, ``I ``Still'' Love This Game!''
fans are again excited. Having showed owners the path, it's up to
the NBA to follow the road to success.
SPOTLIGHT ON ...
MASHBURN NOT ALL THUMBS AS HE RECOVERS FROM INJURY
</P>
<P>
   Former Maverick franchise cornerstone Jamal Mashburn is off the
trading block in Miami and on schedule for an unlikely return from
last season's nasty thumb injury.
</P>
<P>
   Last Feb. 13 in Detroit Mashburn fell awkwardly on his right
thumb, fracturing it in 16 places. Doctors inserted two screws in
the thumb, told Mashburn he might never play again and would
certainly never regain normal use of the hand.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago Mashburn, offensive option No. 3 for the Heat behind
Tim Hardaway and Alonzo Mourning, shocked himself by simply
reaching down and picking up a ball with one hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've scored 50 points in a game,'' said Mashburn, ``but that
was the biggest thrill in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Mashburn, who scored the 50 against Scottie Pippen at the United
Center in 1994, was rumored to be headed out of Miami as coach Pat
Riley pursued Latrell Sprewell. But now Riley, after being
impressed by Mashburn in training camp and needing a third scorer
in the wake of shooting guard Voshon Lenard's injury, says he sees
the 26-year-old small forward maturing into the player he
envisioned when he acquired him from Dallas for Kurt Thomas, Sasha
Danilovic and Martin Muursepp on Feb. 14, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``People started doubting me for a while, and I kind of doubted
myself,'' said Mashburn. ``But I showed before the injury I was on
my way back. And now, palming that ball is a sign I'm going to get
all the way back.''
IN THE PAINT OFFBEAT BEAT
</P>
<P>
   Cavaliers All-Star forward Shawn Kemp is working to drop off the
extra 30 pounds he put on during the lockout. And, he rid himself
of some emotional baggage as well.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp, who has fathered seven children with six women, finally
addressed his situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just an NBA problem; it's the nation's problem,''
Kemp said of out-of-wedlock pregnancies. ``I know what I did was
wrong. Now I've got to live with it and be the best person I can
be.''
BEST AND WORST
</P>
<P>
   Worst ceremony: The Bulls are planning a special night to honor
Phil Jackson and retire a jersey in his likeness. Had they simply
honored him last year, they could've had the NBA leader in career
winning percentage and owner of six championships still on their
bench. Only Red Auerbach of the Celtics, Red Holzman of the Knicks,
Jack Ramsay of the Trail Blazers and Frank Layden of the Jazz have
had jerseys retired in their honor.
</P>
<P>
   Best botching of a No. 1 overall pick: With Jim Jackson signing
with the Blazers last week, the Warriors now have absolutely
nothing to show for Joe Smith, the first pick in the '95 draft.
They traded Smith and Brian Shaw to the Sixers last year for
Jackson and Clarence Weatherspoon, who signed with the Heat.
QUOTE OF NOTE
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe the fans will come back. What are they going
to do when they're flipping around the TV? Stop at ``Three's
Company'' instead of the Sonics and Lakers? I don't think so.'' _
Sonics coach Paul Westphal.

DRIBBLING AROUND THE EAST
</P>
<P>
   How far have the Bulls fallen? They were 15-point underdogs
Friday night at Utah. ... The Knicks definitely have a new look at
power forward, where they traded grizzled warrior Charles Oakley
for Marcus Camby, who missed two days of practice and an exhibition
game with a deep blister. ... Give the Nets' computer geeks credit
for the signing of free-agent forward Scott Burrell. Coach John
Calipari wowed Burrell with a video play book that used footage of
Burrell superimposed into a Nets uniform.
DRIBBLING AROUND THE WEST
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal wanted Tom Gugliotta, now it's Dennis Rodman.
Guess he and power forward Elden Campbell don't do lunch often.
``We tried to make some moves, but I guess other teams really don't
want to help us,'' O'Neal said of Minnesota turning down a
Gugliotta-for-Campbell-and-Eddie Jones deal. ``So from now on I'll
hold a personal vendetta against Minnesota. They're added to the
list.'' ... Bigger Country: Grizzlies center Bryant Reeves showed
up for camp at 318 pounds, or 40 more than last season. He's lost
his starting job to journeyman Tony Massenburg.
INSIDE THE NUMBERS

<P>
   Only 11 players have scored 20,000 points and grabbed 10,000

JOURNALIST CONTRADICTS BLUMENTHAL'S `STALKER' DENIAL

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House prosecutors turned over to the Senate on
Saturday a sworn affidavit of a journalist who contradicted White
House aide Sidney Blumenthal's videotaped claim that he never
divulged President Clinton's initial claim that Lewinsky was a
``stalker'' who made sexual demands of him.
</P>
<P>
   British journalist Christopher Hitchens, a contributor to Vanity
Fair and The Nation magazines, said in an affidavit signed Friday
that Blumenthal told him and an unidentified person over lunch on
March 19, 1998, that Lewinsky was ``a stalker'' and that the
president was ``the victim' of a predatory and unstable sexually
demanding young woman.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal also disseminated the same account to other
journalists, Hitchens said.
</P>
<P>
   In his deposition, Blumenthal said he met with Clinton in the
Oval Office on Jan. 21, 1998, the day the Lewinsky story broke in
the Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said Clinton told him that Lewinsky referred to
herself as a ``stalker,'' and that she would either have an affair
or claim she had an affair with Clinton to prove the nickname
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal, in the deposition, said he never shared the
information with journalists.
</P>
<P>
   The second House impeachment article accusing Clinton of
obstructing justice specifically alleges that the president spread
false stories about Lewinsky so aides would repeat them in front of
the grand jury. It does not accuse Clinton of disseminating them to
journalists, but proof that White House aides were the source of
such stories would be embarrassing to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, a witness contradicting Blumenthal could expose
Blumenthal to a charge of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from Blumenthal, a journalist who
wrote for the Washington Post, the New Republic and the Nation
before going to the White House in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to House prosecutors said their investigators were alerted
to Hitchens version of events late last week and secured a sworn
affidavit from him on Friday.

MONICA LEWINSKY STARS IN VIDEOTAPE DEBUT AT CLINTON TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   EDS: Editing, trims throughout)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Videotapes rolled at the Senate impeachment trial
Saturday as senators and the American public saw Monica Lewinsky
for the first time tell her now-familiar story of sex,
job-searching and a false affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   There were no dramatic revelations during the six hours of
arguments and video, and the Senate appeared headed for an
almost-certain vote to acquit President Clinton later this week on
the two impeachment articles charging perjury and obstruction of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the public debut of Lewinsky on videotape
dominated the proceeding as senators and the American public saw a
poised young lady talk about her relationship with the president of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on four large TV monitors set up in the Senate
chamber, Lewinsky appeared calm and composed, wearing a string of
pearls and a dark top, her lips glossed pink. She punctuated her
sentences by brushing her black, helmet-like hair off her face or
flicking it back with a shake of her head.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, asked about her response to presidential confidant
Vernon Jordan's suggestion that her ``problem'' was that she was in
love with Clinton, Lewinksy flashed an embarrassed smile and said:
``I probably blushed or giggled or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about how she felt about Clinton now, Lewinsky said, ``I
have mixed feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors used Lewinsky's testimony and that of
presidential confidant Vernon Jordan and White House aide Sidney
Blumenthal to bolster their case that the president lied in his
August 19, 1998, grand jury appearance about his affair with
Lewinsky, and obstructed justice by encouraging her to file a false
affidavit in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Lewinsky's statement that Clinton didn't ask her to lie
and that there were no explicit promises of a job in exchange for
her silence, prosecutor Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., argued that the
testimony of Lewinsky, Clinton and others taken together shows how
Clinton ``wove a web of perjury and obstruction.'' Rogan was her
main questioner at the videotaped deposition last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors zeroed in on Clinton's 2 a.m. phone call to Lewinsky
on Dec. 17, 1997, when he informed her that her name had come up on
the witness list faxed to the White House by Jones' lawyers.
Clinton also suggested Lewinsky could sign an affidavit to avoid
testifying.
</P>
<P>
   The video showed Lewinsky being asked about Clinton's suggestion
she could say her frequent Oval Office trips were to see
presidential secretary Betty Currie or bring Clinton letters.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky said she had heard those words before. Secrecy and
denial, she said, ``was part of the pattern of the relationship ...
I knew I would deny the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky ultimately signed an affidavit denying the relationship
on Jan. 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also a videotape excerpt showing Lewinsky recalling
that Currie called her on Dec. 28, 1997, and saying she would drive
by Lewinsky's apartment to pick up a package.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume (Currie) meant the gifts,'' Lewinsky said, referring
to gifts she had received from Clinton that were being sought by
Jones' lawyers. Currie retrieved the gifts and stashed them under
her bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way the Betty Currie could know to come and get the
gifts was the president telling her to do so,'' Rogan said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also focused on Jordan's claim that at a critical
juncture in December 1997 Clinton didn't tell him that Lewinsky's
name was on the witness list.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said ``it would have been helpful'' to have this
information as he dialed influential corporate friends in high
places to find Lewinsky a job.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said he did not learn that Lewinsky was on the Jones
witness list until Dec. 19, 1997 _ 13 days after Clinton first
learned it.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors argue Clinton and Jordan intensified the job
search for Lewinsky that month in order to keep her from telling
the truth about her affair with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's legal team argued that Lewinsky's testimony ``is so
clear, it exonerates the president,'' as one of the lawyers, Nicole
Seligman, put it.
</P>
<P>
   In excerpts played by the White House legal team, Lewinsky
recalls Clinton suggesting in the Dec. 17, 1997, phone call that
she could sign an affidavit, but she insisted: ``There was no
discussion of what would be in the affidavit.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she understood the implication of filing a false
affidavit, Lewinsky responded: ``I don't think I necessarily
thought at that point that it would have to be false.'' That
accords with Clinton's contention that he believed Lewinsky could
sign a truthful affidavit denying a sexual relationship because
they had not had sexual intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   Senate reaction to the videos ranged the spectrum of party
affiliation and political conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've heard is devastating to the White House,'' said Sen.
Larry Craig, R-Idaho. ``Now we know why the White House fought to
the bitter end on disallowing those videotapes... once you bring
all those personalities together, the story becomes complete.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig continued: ``The president didn't tell (Lewinsky) to lie,
but she obviously understood that she was to tell a story that was
a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig said Lewinsky at last had deflated White House attempts to
smear her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American public could see Monica Lewinsky for the first
time as Monica Lewinsky. Is she a stalker today? No. Is she a
predator? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., said he felt the videos were
``very powerful,'' and that Lewinsky ``came across as very straight
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was deja vu all over again,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt., who sat in on all the depositions.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats scoffed that the videos didn't tell them anything new.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors are ``making the best case they can, but
there's nothing new in the videos,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., accused House prosecutors of
changing their theory of the impeachment case against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've gone from a conspiracy theory to `No one knew, but the
president,''' Boxer said, referring to Lewinsky's denial of
pressure on the affidavit and Jordan saying the president failed to
tell him about Lewinsky's name on the Jones witness list as he
searched for a job for her in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very strange theory,'' Boxer said. ``If nobody felt any
pressure, nobody made any connections, what happened? Nothing. I
think (prosecutors) hurt themselves badly.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, outside the Senate chamber during breaks, senators
batted the idea of a censure resolution back and forth with little
evidence they were close to agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tapping into that emotion should be fairly easy,'' said Sen.
Robert Bennett, R-Utah, who has worked with Sen. Dianne Feinstein,
D-Calif., to come up with bipartisan agreement on a censure
resolution. ``But finding the right set of words that can get
everyone in general agreement on the same idea is not so easy.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted between 60 and 80 votes for censure.
</P>
<P>
   Other senators, particularly conservative Republicans, said they
opposed censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a pat on the butt saying `Go home, you bad boy,'''
said Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, said censure would set a ``bad
precedent'' for the future. ``What the American people want us to
do is get back to our business,'' DeWine said. ``People will be
shocked if an hour or a day after an up-or-down vote on
impeachment, we are back in the U.S. Senate debating the
president's conduct...It is not the job of the U.S. Congress to
punish the president.''

By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Reds are making a brave attempt at being decent
this year.
</P>
<P>
   You have to salute their audacity, but also wonder if they can
carry this through an entire season or if general manager Jim
Bowden will be forced to dismantle come July 31.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds greatly improved their starting rotation by acquiring
Denny Neagle from the Atlanta Braves in November and they added
badly-needed power to their lineup last week when they traded for
San Diego Padres outfielder Greg Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle joins Brett Tomko and Pete Harnisch to give the Reds a
nice front to their starting rotation. It could get even better if
pitching coach Don Gullett can get either Jason Bere and/or Steve
Avery back to where they once were.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn and shortstop Barry Larkin, who is no longer looking to
be traded, provide veteran anchors to a young lineup with
considerable potential. First baseman Sean Casey, right fielder
Dmitri Young and center fielder Mike Cameron all have a chance to
be pretty good offensive players.
</P>
<P>
   The moves, which will bring the Reds payroll up to $31 million,
should at least make the Reds a contender in the National League
Central. They were 77-85 last season, but are easily the most
improved team in the division.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Astros still have the best team, but aren't as good
as they were at the end of last year after losing Randy Johnson.
Their biggest acquisition this off-season was third baseman Ken
Caminiti, but that overlooks the fact that Sean Berry and Bill
Spiers were an extremely productive platoon combination last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Cubs only real move was signing free agent catcher
Benito Santiago. They acquired pitcher Jon Lieber from Pittsburgh,
but lost Mark Clark to free agency. The St. Louis Cardinals
upgraded their bullpen with Scott Radinsky and Ricky Bottalico, but
failed to address their crippled starting pitching. They acquired
shortstop Edgar Renteria and outfielder Eric Davis, but lost
outfielder Brian Jordan and second baseman Delino DeShields.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad the Reds couldn't afford another $16 million for,
say, free agent third baseman Dean Palmer ($7 million), closer Mike
Timlin ($4 million) and Clark ($5 million) to help their rotation.
Then they would have a legitimate pennant contender.
</P>
<P>
   Instead the Reds have to count on Aaron Boone at third, unproven
Gabe White as their closer and either Avery or Bere to come through
as starters. It's also unlikely they'll have enough money to make
the big midseason trade all contenders look for to boost their
chances down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Reds manager Jack McKeon has to hope his team comes
together in the first few months of the season. Otherwise Bowden
would have to pull the plug and unload Neagle, Vaughn and maybe
even Larkin.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost an impossible task trying to compete as a
small-market team. One mistake or a key injury could cause the
whole thing to unravel and cost an owner millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But at least the Reds are making a legitimate attempt.
CLEMENS VS. CLARK
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens is a much better pitcher than Mark Clark. The
Toronto Blue Jays were 24-9 last year during Clemens 33 starts
while the Chicago Cubs were 12-21 when Clark started for them.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers would be better off with Clemens on their staff
rather than Clark. But would it have been better to have traded for
Clemens rather than signing Clark as a free agent?
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the previous four years.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Red Sox and the Blue Jays were a combined 65-50 when
Clemens started for them in 1994-97. That includes a Cy Young Award
season for Toronto in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   During that same period, Clark's teams - Cleveland, New York
Mets and the Cubs - were 63-42 when he pitched. That's a .600
winning percentage compared to a .565 winning percentage for
Clemens' teams.
</P>
<P>
   Again, nobody is saying Clark is the better pitcher. Clemens had
a 2.84 ERA during that stretch while Clark's ERA was 3.97 and three
of those seasons were in the National League. Clemens also pitched
50 more innings per year.
</P>
<P>
   But Clark is also five years younger and makes $3.5 million less
- if you don't have to renegotiate Clemen's contract.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest thing is the Rangers didn't have to give up Ivan
Rodriguez, Rusty Greer, Rick Helling or valuable minor league
prospects to get Clark.
</P>
<P>
   That's why they were better off signing Clark than trading for
Clemens.
SHORT HOPS
</P>
<P>
   The Padres, trying to stem the exodus out of San Diego, will
attempt to work out a long-term contract extension with reliever
Trevor Hoffman during spring training. He can be a free agent after
the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians are concerned shortstop Omar Vizquel might hold out
in spring training because the club refuses to re-negotiate his
contract. Vizquel signed a six-year contract after the 1995 season
worth $3 million per year with an option for a seventh season. But
now he's unhappy his salary is well below what Roberto Alomar (four
years, $32 million), Jose Offerman (four years, $26 million) and
others are getting.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the price you pay for long-term security and general
manager John Hart is right in refusing to renegotiate. After all,
Vizquel wouldn't be giving any money back had he suffered a
career-ending injury.
</P>
<P>
   Phillies catcher Mike Lieberthal, who missed the final two
months of last season with a pelvic stress fracture, has told
manager Terry Francona he's close to 100 percent after an intensive
off-season of rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Orioles manager Ray Miller wants to use Albert Belle as his No.
3 hitter, meaning Will Clark will bat cleanup.

DEFENSE POWERS RUTGERS PAST BOSTON COLLEGE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHESTNUT HILL, Mass. _ Rutgers women's basketball coach C.
Vivian Stringer has a lot of reasons to smile these days.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off Saturday's 71-52 victory over Boston College at the
Conte Forum, the Scarlet Knights are 20-4 overall and 12-1 in the
Big East. They are ranked 12th nationally and have won 10 of their
last 11 games and 14 of their last 16.
</P>
<P>
   In the Big East, they trail only Connecticut (19-3; 12-1 heading
into Saturday night's game at Miami).
</P>
<P>
   The Scarlet Knights were led by Tammy Sutton-Brown's 18 points
and a stingy defense that held No. 20 Boston College to 31.5
percent shooting. Tomora Young fished with 16 points, 14 in the
first 8{ minutes. And Tasha Pointer had 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun to coach this game and exciting as well,'' Stringer
said. ``We got good looks at the basket and we were able to take
good shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers opened by making its first four shots, including three
three-pointers by Young in a 68-second span, to pull to an 11-0
lead 2:14 in.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the Knights' man-to-man defense that set the tone of
the game. Ranked second in the country and first in the Big East,
Rutgers defense allows only 55.6 points a game and has held
opponents under 50 points six times this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hadn't played man-to-man in a game this year,'' Stringer
said, ``but the players were very focused. We found our
killer-instinct today.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston College (17-5, 9-5), which lost its second straight,
scored its fewest points this season. Becky Gottstein scored 12
points and Whitney Steele 11 for the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   In only her fourth year at Rutgers, Stringer has guided her
program back to national prominence. She called Saturday's effort
on the road against a ranked opponent a confidence-booster to
propel her players into the stretch drive.
</P>
<P>
   This year Rutgers hosts the Big East tournament, and with only
five games remaining on their schedule, the Scarlet Knights are
eyeing the No. 1 seed. Their toughest test will come next Saturday
when they host No. 6 Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Their ultimate goal, of course, is an appearance in the Final
Four in San Jose, Calif., next month.

 &HT;    Lewinsky's portrayal takes dignity away from process, principles
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fate arranged a cruel irony for the U.S. Senate on
the day it allowed Monica Lewinsky's videotaped image and voice
into its presence.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative clerk Scott Bates, who conducted most Senate roll
call votes, including those during the impeachment trial, was
killed in an accident Friday night. So as the Senate gathered to at
last hear from Lewinsky, the voice with which the institution
itself has come to be identified, was silent.
</P>
<P>
   The moment of silence for Bates set a somber mood for a session
that many senators have for months worried would upset the Senate's
dignity. Those concerns appear to have been overwrought. Whatever
momentary fascination may have come with the opportunity to study
someone who has been silent through so much speculation, Lewinsky's
excerpted testimony did nothing to lower this process further than
it has sunk.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone's dignity was insulted by these concluding arguments
in the impeachment trial, it was Lewinsky's.
</P>
<P>
   Feminists have been conflicted over the Lewinsky case from the
beginning _ a subject explored in countless op-ed pieces. Still, it
was striking how much feminists have been struggling over for
decades now went by the board during this session without protest.
</P>
<P>
   There was no reference to ``Vernon'' or ``Sidney'' when the
videotaped excerpts of Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal were
introduced. And yet, when House managers repeatedly referred to
Lewinsky as ``Monica,'' no one, including the women senators of
both parties, rose to object.
</P>
<P>
   This diminution of the case's central witness to her first name
fit into a larger effort to portray Lewinsky as young and
vulnerable, a sympathetic figure victimized by a powerful man. To
that end, the managers, who days ago were fighting to have her
hauled onto the floor for eight hours of grilling, made much of how
her youthful hopes have been ``drastically altered.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the sympathetic treatment, this grandfatherly treatment
is just as belittling as the White House effort to portray her as
some kind of ditzy femme fatale. Neither characterization grants to
Lewinsky true responsibility for her actions.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any impression of the former White House intern to
be derived from the excerpts that were shown Saturday, it is that
of a young woman with a very clear idea _ whether wise or unwise,
right or wrong _ of what she was doing. Judging from the initial
response to the House managers' closing arguments Saturday morning,
the video image of Lewinsky, accompanied by her infantilization on
the part of the managers, had an impact, even if it will not
overturn the outcome of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The impact seems to have been entirely based on the somewhat
shocked response _ even after all the stories and all the endlessly
looped video clips _ to the obvious difference in age between
Lewinsky and the president. It certainly did not come from the
substance of her testimony, which was as cautious and unexciting as
one would expect from a client of Plato Cacheris.
</P>
<P>
   But at some point, somebody ought to point out that fooling
around with an older woman would have been adultery also. And it
hardly does credit to women in their mid-20s to leave the
impression they are less capable of making judgments about how to
conduct themselves than are gray-haired men.
</P>
<P>
   More than once, House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde has alluded
to those who lie in graves near foreign battlefields, their lives
sacrificed for the principles he said are at stake in this trial.
It's worth mentioning _ even this late in the trial _ that a lot of
them gave their lives before they reached the age of Monica
Lewinsky.

 &HT;    Chance to `meet' Lewinsky gives case against Clinton
credibility, some say
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The thought that may have lingered in the minds of
many Americans as they watched the unfolding saga of Bill Clinton
and Monica Lewinsky was on the lips of Laura Emons on Saturday
after she spent the morning at Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man could have been her father. I think that would hurt
him more than anything,'' said Emons, a Chespeake, Va., who was
spending a weekend in Washington with a girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the United States is 52 years old. His partner
in history's most famous extramarital relationship is 25. This much
is well known.
</P>
<P>
   But never before had Americans seen and heard Lewinsky. When
they did, the disparity in age and power between Clinton and
Lewinsky seemed that much greater, Emons said.
</P>
<P>
   If the outcome of the impeachment trial is a foregone conclusion
and Clinton is to remain in office _ as senators and most everyone
else believe _ then Lewinsky's first public appearance via
videotape Saturday might have been aimed at the court of public
opinion and, perhaps, history.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to arguing the perjury and obstruction of justice
charges, the prosecutors also seemed to try to portray Clinton as a
lowlife, a user of women who cared so little about them that he was
willing to tell crude lies about them to trusted aides.
</P>
<P>
   Spectators, especially women, leaving the packed gallery after
15 minutes or an hour of watching the former White House employee,
commented on Lewinsky's credibility as a witness and prosecutors'
success in weaving a sordid tale of her affair with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've read all about this, but somehow hearing it gave the
story some more credibility,'' Sharon Jarvis, a suburban Milwaukee
resident, said. ``She just speaks in a conversational tone.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion that giving people a chance to ``meet'' Lewinsky
would change minds was a key component of the prosecution's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), addressing
reporters during a break in the trial, called the presentation
compelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have finally had the chance to see live people talking
about what had happened,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said several callers to his office Saturday lamented the
Senate's decision not to have live witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.), who opposed having Lewinsky
testify in person, said the prosecutors' ability to use videotaped
excerpts of the depositions of Lewinsky, Washington lawyer Vernon
Jordan and Clinton aide Sidney Blumenthal enhanced their
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The video probably was more powerful and coherent than it
would have been if we had the natural disorder of witnesses and
objections, the normal courtroom confusion,'' Coverdell said.
</P>
<P>
   The first image of Lewinsky showed her with her right hand
raised, swearing an oath to be truthful in last week's deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) provided spectators the first
noticable reaction, a shake of his head and a rueful smile.
</P>
<P>
   One theme that ran through reactions to the videotape was that,
despite Lewinsky's evident youth, she had the self-assurance of
someone who knew what she wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's conversations with Clinton, Jordan and Oval Office
secretary Betty Currie sometimes makes it seem that ``she had the
whole White House at her beck and call,'' Chrisann LaPorte of
Franklin Lakes, N.J., said.
</P>
<P>
   Muffy Rowe of Hawthorne, N.J., LaPorte's friend, chimed in,
``She knew what she was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet LaPorte and Rowe, both stay-at-home mothers of two young
children, said Lewinsky's testimony made a powerful impression on
them and altered their view of Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear to me he lied and obstructed justice,'' LaPorte
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she would admit to an affair, Rowe said, ``If I was
being deposed I would.''
</P>
<P>
   Their reaction to the presentation is the one prosecutors hope
to establish in the record of the trial, whatever its outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``My 4-year-old is at the age when he is learning right from
wrong,'' LaPorte said. ``How can we condone this kind of lying?''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors' use of Lewinsky, Jordan and Blumenthal on tape
may not have changed any minds in the Senate, and certainly did not
affect the views of some spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Keith and Darlene Kerr, new to the Washington area, said that
the effort to show Lewinsky as the girl next door had not moved
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the videos would have been better with some background
music,'' Keith Kerr said.
</P>
<P>
   Jose J. Rodriguez of Alexandria said Saturday's session
persuaded him that Republicans had undertaken ``a political attempt
to get rid of President Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez markets political paraphenalia, including buttons that
offer a racy look at the sex scandal and its cover up.
</P>
<P>
   The lasting impression Rodriguez said he took from Lewinsky's
videotape is of an impressive woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see how she became a presidential girlfriend,'' he said.
``She can be my girlfriend.''

 &HT;    `Battle of snippets' proves anti-climactic
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ We were up and we were in front of our TVs at 10 a.m.
Saturday morning for one reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``An ignoble impulse,'' CNN's Jeff Greenfield admitted, speaking
for many of us, of why he'd be watching Monica Lewinsky's
videotaped testimony during Saturday's very special episode of the
Senate impeachment trial. ``(I) just want to see the real-life
person who almost got the president removed from office.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, there she was: Lewinsky, raising a pudgy
hand while taking her oath. She looked, Greenfield later put it,
``like an early 1960s college graduate, with her pearls and her
hair that way.... Monica looks very young to be with a middle-aged
man.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a curious moment, watching her, looking for something,
anything, we hadn't seen before. ``The fascination factor,'' PBS's
Margaret Warner explained, ``of finally putting a human face on
this trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Lewinsky's appearance rarely rose to anything more than a
long-awaited curiosity; like the rest of this historic trial, it
was hardly great TV. Locally, ABC, NBC and Fox didn't even air it,
while CBS stuck around until the House managers took their first
break. A year ago, Greenfield said, ``the atmosphere would have
been electric.'' On Saturday, it felt anti-climactic.
</P>
<P>
   We looked _ stared _ for something more charged than another
unreeling of the evidence, of testimony that Lewinsky would be
giving, as attorney Mark Braden said on CNN, ``for the gazillion
and oneth time.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we were looking for a kind videotaped version of Linda
Tripp's audio-taped phone converstations: a lovestruck
mistress-scorned gossiping in Valley-speak about the Big Creep.
</P>
<P>
   The best we got Saturday was her sipping a glass of water
through a straw and, and when asked if she was a resident of
California, her answer: ``I'm not sure where I'm a resident right
now. But that's where I'm living.''
</P>
<P>
   She was mostly just poised and straightforward and at ease; when
she couldn't remember something, she answered a lot like Vernon
Jordan, whose testimony also ran on Saturday, and said she stood by
her grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they hear one more time `I stand by my grand jury
testimony,' I think the House managers are going to jump out of
their suits,'' said PBS's Paul Gigot.
</P>
<P>
   It was mostly, said CBS's Bob Schieffer, ``a battle of
snippets'' _ clips and excerpts and soundbites of the videotape
that each side spliced to its advantage. The picture that resulted
was disappointingly incomplete _ more a sampling than a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really seeing her as a person yet,'' said PBS's Tom
Oliphant. ``What they're presenting is not her, but a part of her.
Each side will show a part of her, but you won't see her.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Saturday was a lot like a real trial, something
TV has always had trouble with.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Today's) proceedings remind us of that fact,'' said CBS's Dan
Rather. ``On televison, we are used to watching courtroom dramas
that are tidy, scripted and determined in advance. But real life is
messier... real life is less like the TV show `Perry Mason' and
more like the movie `Rashomon.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After surely throwing some of his audience with that overly
off-handed allusion to the 1951 Oscar-winning film from Japan,
Rather really revved up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same events can be perceived very differently by different
people. Truth is never absolute,'' he waxed. ``It is more often a
matter of grudging compromise. So it is in the video testimony you
have been watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Following that lordly lecture, Rather crashed back down to
earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We return now,'' he said, ``to regular programming.

 &HT;    Lewinsky comes across as `bright, clear' in dueling video clips
shown to Senate
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr and Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pressing their case before a national television
audience, House Republican prosecutors and White House lawyers
offered dueling video snippets Saturday of the woman at the center
of the perjury and obstruction of justice case against President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   For the House prosecutors, putting Monica Lewinsky's videotape
deposition before the Senate marked a last-ditch effort to win over
the court of public opinion after realizing they have all but lost
the Senate vote to remove the president from office.
</P>
<P>
   For the White House, it was an opportunity to clear the
president of the allegation that he encouraged Lewinsky to file a
false statement to lawyers pursuing a sexual harassment lawsuit
against the president. They also hoped to fend off the charge that
he enlisted his friend Vernon Jordan to help Lewinsky get a job in
exchange for not cooperating in that lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a black jacket and a single strand of pearls,
Lewinsky appeared confident and poised in her answers to questions
about whether the president encouraged her to file a false
statement in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit. At various
times during the day-long hearing, the prosecution and the defense
used the same video bites to make opposing points.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides zeroed in on the most serious charge against Clinton,
that he obstructed justice in his efforts to conceal his
relationship with Lewinsky. Prosecutors mentioned only in passing
the charge that Clinton lied to a federal grand jury, a claim that
many senators have said is the weakest.
</P>
<P>
   Closing arguments in the trial are scheduled for Monday before
the Senate debates a motion to open the deliberations to the
public, and then goes into jury deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   In making the case for the prosecutors, Rep. James Rogan
(R-Calif.) told the senators any one of them could have known a
young, impressionable intern like Lewinsky. Was it right for the
president to have impulsively used her for his own gratification
and then launched a scheme to conceal that affair?
</P>
<P>
   Life is about making the right choices, Rogan said. Had the
president's ``bad decision'' to have an affair with Lewinsky ended
with adultery, the Senate would not be conducting a trial, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seek no punishment for a man who cheated on his wife,''
Rogan said. Rather, the prosecutors are seeking punishment for a
man who had ``cheated the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Summing up the House case, Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.)
delivered an emotional plea to convict Clinton of the two charges
against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a nation of men or kings, we are nation of laws.''
Graham said. ``That's what this case is about. For God sakes,
figure out what kind of man we have here in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they fought hard to prevent House prosecutors from
airing the videotaped depositions of Lewinsky, Jordan and White
House aide Sidney Blumenthal, Clinton's lawyers nonetheless
liberally aired long segments of the depositions to make their case
that the president never explicitly told Lewinsky to lie in her
Jones case affidavit or to get rid of the many gifts he gave her.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Seligman, one of Clinton's personal attorneys, accused
House prosecutors of using the video excerpts to distort the
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mangers have cleverly snipped here and there to tell their
story,'' Seligman said. ``They have distorted, omitted and they
have created a wholly erroneous story.''
</P>
<P>
   Seligman aired long portions of Lewinsky's deposition in which
she told House prosecutors that Clinton never instructed her how to
complete her affidavit in the sexual harassment suit.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors pointed out that Clinton also never told Lewinsky to
tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The managers ask you to convict the president based on his
silence,'' Seligman responded.
</P>
<P>
   In the day's only moment of levity, Graham made reference to the
early-morning telephone call Clinton made to Lewinsky on Dec. 17,
1997, in which he told her she was on the Jones case witness list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where I come from, you call someone at 2:30 in the morning,
and you're up to no good,'' said Graham, prompting loud guffaws
from both Republicans and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors also sought to use Lewinsky's deposition to
bolster their case that Clinton ordered his personal secretary,
Betty Currie, to retrieve gifts from Lewinsky that he had given to
her over the course of their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way Betty Currie would know to pick up the
president's gifts would be if the president told her to,'' Rogan
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Seligman reminded senators that neither Lewinsky nor Currie
ever said that Clinton told either of them that he was behind the
gift retrieval, and she quoted Lewinsky saying that she had decided
on her own that she would give to the Jones lawyers only
``innocuous gifts'' that would not arouse suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica Lewinsky had made her own decision for her own reasons
not to produce gifts,'' Seligman said. ``It is time for this
tireless pursuit of the president to come to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing the videotaped depositions for most of the week,
some senators could barely contain their frustration at having been
brought in on a Saturday to view snippets of the videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking of making a constitutional point of order that
this is cruel and unusual punishment,'' joked Sen. Patrick Leahy
(D-Vt.).
</P>
<P>
   ``The trial has been over for several days,'' said Sen. Chris
Dodd (D-Conn.). ``This is water torture.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said that Lewinsky came off poised, bright and
well-spoken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, she's a fine young woman, from what I can tell,''
said Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   But Larry Craig (R-Ind.) said he thought the House prosecutors
had put on a stellar case and that the videotaped witnesses filled
in holes of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's obviously bright, clear,'' Craig added. ``The public is
seeing her for the first time as Monica Lewinsky, not as the White
House wants to see her. Is she a stalker today? No. Is she a
predator? No. I think they (the public) are seeing something they
may not have expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton (R-Wash.) said the House prosecutors made
their most convincing case to date with Saturday's presenation.
``Not to say that votes were changed in the Senate,'' he said,
``but it was a dramatic presentation for the nation as a whole.''

<HEADLINE>
NOW HE'S THE BOSS: OU'S STOOPS FACES NEW CHALLENGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the personnel decisions made by NCAA Division I-A
athletic directors, this one ranks among the toughest:
</P>
<P>
   When is a bright, promising assistant ready to assume the mantle
of head football coach and direct your highest-profile program?
</P>
<P>
   Promoting the right guy can lead to decades of success and
stability. Witness Joe Paterno at Penn State or former Nebraska
coach Tom Osborne. Both men rose from the assistant ranks at their
respective schools to become legends, combining for a record of
562-129-6 and five national championships in 58 seasons (33 years
for Paterno, 25 for Osborne).
</P>
<P>
   Selecting the wrong up-and-comer, on the other hand, can prove
disastrous. Three years after Oklahoma officials entrusted their
program to John Blake, a former Sooners player and NFL assistant
who had never been a coordinator at any level, regents voted to
fire him in the wake of a 12-22 mark that stands as the worst
three-year stretch in the history of the school's football program.
</P>
<P>
   What is interesting, however, is that Oklahoma officials
replaced Blake with another man who will open the 1999 season with
a career mark of 0-0 at the Division I-A level: Bob Stoops, a
former Florida defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   If Stoops follows the lead of Blake, the Oklahoma program is in
trouble. If he follows in the footsteps of two lifelong assistants
who made OU their first stop as head football coaches _ Bud
Wilkinson and Barry Switzer _ the Sooners' return to glory is just
around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Lest anyone forget, the once-unproven Wilkinson and Switzer
combined for a record of 302-58-8 while working in Norman, Okla.
Each won three national championships. No other OU coach has won
one.
</P>
<P>
   Why should Sooners fans, who have not experienced a winning
season since 1993, believe Stoops' tenure will follow more closely
the path taken by Wilkinson and Switzer than Blake? Administrators
and peers point to a variety of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   For the past five years, rival college coaches have identified
Stoops, 38, as one of the game's elite assistants who seemed headed
down the fast track to success. Blake never received such
widespread acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   Stoops has served as a defensive coordinator for the past eight
seasons at two schools (Florida and Kansas State) that have posted
multiple top-10 finishes, including a 1996 national championship in
Stoops' first year at Florida. Blake never had been in charge of
either offense or defense before being hired in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest difference, in the estimation of Oklahoma
athletic director Joe Castiglione, rests with intangibles:
organization skills, accountability, and a confident presence that
should play favorably with alumni and media members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt Bob Stoops had experienced everything about the game
but having that head coach title,'' Castiglione said. ``He has been
in all the big games, over and over again. He constantly prepares
in a high-visibility arena. Everywhere he's been, he's been an
individual who has risen to the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stoops will have the backbone to stay the course and have guts
enough that, if a judgmental error is made here or there, he'll
admit it. But he'll fix it and go on. He has exhibited tremendous
leadership qualities and that, with his preparation and personal
commitment to strong values, I felt was a super fit. This is
something that's got to be long-term.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoops, who received lukewarm reviews on his first recruiting
class, will not face the acid test until September, when the
Sooners open the 1999 season. But he said he feels comfortable in
his new role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where I've been has given me great preparation to be able to
handle this position,'' said Stoops, who has been an assistant
coach at Iowa (1983-87) and Kent State (1988), as well as Kansas
State (1989-95) and Florida (1996-98). ``All I can say is, `I feel
very comfortable in this position.' I feel I can attract and get
the kind of staff that knows how to build and win championships. I
believe in time, I'll be a guy that fans will be happy with.''
</P>
<P>
   Until someone has proved his mettle as a head coach with the
won-loss record, impressions created by actions taken as an
assistant are the only means of judging an up-and-coming talent.
Little things, say coaches and administrators, mean a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Willingness to handle interviews and alumni gatherings sharpen
much-needed people skills. Success as a coordinator implies
probable success overseeing the entire program, especially if that
coach is willing to delegate responsibilities to fellow assistants.
A zeal for pounding the pavement as a recruiter suggests you will
be aggressive in pursuit of the talent necessary to turn around a
downtrodden program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys sit around and don't want to do any of those
things,'' said Texas A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum. ``Then, they turn
around and ask, `How come I wasn't the head coach?' Well, you
didn't do anything head coaches have to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember going to every clinic and speaking to every A&AMP;M
club I could \Ras an assistant\S because I was putting money in the
bank for here or somewhere else. They're not always fun deals. But
it's what you do if you want to do this job.''
</P>
<P>
   Because an assistant's attributes must be judged by others,
Slocum said body language is important for the aspiring head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot comes down to intangibles,'' Slocum said. ``The way they
carry themselves. The way they dress. The comments they make. As a
head coach, you'll have a bunch of situations where ... you have to
bite the bullet and go on. Guys having the composure in those
situations to take the high road and see the big picture separates
some of the guys from the also-rans.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoops, in the estimation of peers, scores well in those areas.
But how can administrators confidently project him to be a
program-turner if his career record is 0-0? Simple, said Ohio State
coach John Cooper. They can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to gut instinct as to when a guy is ready,''
Cooper said. ``It's something that happens over a period of time,
but I don't know if there is a certain point you know for sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a successful head coach, the No. 1 thing you've got to
do is recruit. You show me a coach who has a good record, and I'll
show you a coach that's got good players and has had a good
schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind skill as a recruiter, Cooper ranks the ability to
delegate responsibility and a grasp of the big picture as the
primary attributes needed to succeed as a Division I-A head
football coach.
</P>
<P>
   Some, such as Arkansas athletic director Frank Broyles, favor a
coach with a background on offense because he will have more
experience in calling plays. Others discount that as a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a myth,'' said Switzer, the former OU and Cowboys'
coach. ``Defensive coaches know more about offense than most
offensive coaches. What do they study all day long? They look at
other people's offenses. They game-plan to stop other people's
offenses. They see how people are attacking them and how they are
vulnerable. A football coach can coach all phases. It doesn't make
any difference what side of the ball he happens to coach.''
</P>
<P>
   What is significant, say coaches and administrators, is the
record of the school where you served as a top assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you haven't been around a program that's the best, you
don't know how to create one yourself,'' said David Boren,
Oklahoma's school president. ``That's a big asset for Bob Stoops.
He's been exposed to winning programs. He knows what `standard of
excellence' means.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoops has coordinated defenses that ranked among the nation's
top 15 in total defense the past five seasons. His 1995 unit at
Kansas State led the nation (250.8 yards per game), and his 1998
unit at Florida ranked 11th nationally, allowing 286.6 yards per
game.
</P>
<P>
   But a hidden plus, in the estimation of A&AMP;M offensive
coordinator Steve Kragthorpe, may be the fact that Stoops holds a
bachelor's degree in marketing from Iowa, where he played defensive
back from 1979-82. The growing emphasis on the business end of
college sports convinced Kragthorpe, 33, to complete his master's
degree in marketing in 1990 before entering the coaching ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``College athletics is corporate America now,'' said Kragthorpe,
33, who turned down a chance to be the head coach at North Texas
after the 1997 season. ``It's not like it was 25 years ago, where
the AD was a former coach. Now, the AD is a former executive who
runs the business aspects of the athletic department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having an MBA is something in my favor. With the money head
coaches are making now, it's a high-profile position. It's not just
about coaching football. It's like being a CEO. In becoming a head
coach, you lose the fact you get to coach a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet to earn the right to become a head coach, you must show
enough aptitude for the X's and O's to be perceived as a major
contributor to a school's success. How soon that aptitude is
rewarded with a chance to direct a Division I-A program is anyone's
guess.
</P>
<P>
   At Oklahoma, school administrators have deemed this to be Bob
Stoops' time. Eventually, his won-loss record will prove whether
they were correct.

 &HT;    Stewart nearly steals Gordon show
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. Tony Stewart, attempting to qualify for his
first Winston Cup start, nearly pulled off the improbable Saturday
in Daytona 500 qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, a former Indy Racing League champion, held the pole for
NASCAR's biggest event with only 14 drivers left to run two
qualifying laps at Daytona International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Stewart and his No. 20 Pontiac team, two-time
defending Winston Cup points champion Jeff Gordon was among them.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who will look to join Cale Yarborough as the only driver
to win three points titles in a row when the '99 season opens Feb.
14, added his first pole position at Daytona to his staggering list
of career achievements. On the second of two qualifying laps,
Gordon, who ran third-to-last out of 57 drivers, covered the
2.5-mile tri-oval in 46.138 seconds in his Chevrolet, an average
speed of 195.067 mph. It was the fastest qualifying mark for the
Daytona 500 since Davey Allison posted an average of 195.955 in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really an incredible lap for us to run that late,''
Gordon said. ``It was a little nerve-racking. ... We gave it
everything we had in practice (on Friday). I thought that was
everything we had, but we were able to get a little bit more out of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more incredible was Stewart, who would have become the
first driver to win the pole in his Winston Cup debut since Dick
Hutcherson did it in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, the 43rd driver out of the pits, bumped Mike Skinner
and the No. 31 Chevrolet from the pole with an average of 194.599
mph. Rusty Wallace, who qualified second, held the pole for more
than an hour before being unseated by Skinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shaking when I got out of the car,'' Stewart said. ``I
couldn't believe it. ... It's a good way to start your coming-out
party.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, 27, won the '97 IRL title and then spent last year
learning the stock-car ropes with his first full Busch Grand
National schedule. He had five top-10 finishes in 22 Busch starts
in 1998, but few expected him to make an immediate impact on the
Winston Cup scene.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gordon, Stewart's career started driving midget and sprint
cars in Indiana. They've met only once in competition _ a midget
race in Indianapolis in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Stewart will be starting outside Gordon on the front row of
the 41st Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that is ironic is that my rookie season at the ('96)
Indy 500, I almost sat on the pole,'' Stewart said. ``I was on the
pole for about 3 1/2 hours and then (someone) broke it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ended up starting on the front row of my first Indy 500. And
now to start on the front row of my first Daytona 500 ... well, I
guess it will be a good trivia question down the road.

 &HT;    Wallace on pole today for shootout
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Rusty Wallace, who held the pole for the
Daytona 500 before being bumped out of the front row by Jeff Gordon
and Winston Cup rookie Tony Stewart, holds the pole for today's Bud
Shootout.
</P>
<P>
   The Shootout, a race of 25 laps with one mandatory pit stop,
features the 14 drivers who won pole positions in Winston Cup races
last season.
</P>
<P>
   John Andretti, who won the pole at the March race in Atlanta,
isn't eligible for the Shootout because his No. 43 Pontiac doesn't
have the required Budweiser decal. That's because car owner Richard
Petty doesn't want his STP team endorsing a brewery.
</P>
<P>
   The Shootout will follow an 11 a.m. qualifying race of 25 laps,
which will feature drivers that had the second-fastest qualifying
times last year.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, who finished sixth in Saturday's qualifying at 194.187
mph, won the first Daytona Shootout last year.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the Shootout will collect $108,000 of the $512,000
purse.
</P>
<P>
   MILESTONE FOR STEWART
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup rookie Tony Stewart, who had the second-fastest
qualifying time at 194.599 mph Saturday, will be the second rookie
to start his first Daytona 500 on the front row.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Ryan started outside pole winner Ramo Stott in the 1976
race, after three drivers, including A.J. Foyt, were disqualified.
That race ended with David Pearson holding off Petty in a dramatic
finish.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's outside pole is the best start for a rookie in his
first Cup race since Kenny Irwin started second at Richmond on
Sept. 9, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   SCHRADER MOVING UP
</P>
<P>
   Veteran driver Ken Schrader, who finished fourth in last year's
Daytona 500 after starting the race in the No. 31 position, posted
the third-highest qualifying time Saturday at 194.553 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader, in his third year with the No. 33 Chevrolet owned by
Andy Petree, finished last year's 500 after severely injuring his
sternum in a crash in one of the Gatorade 125 qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
   THIS AND THAT
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte, who won the pole last year in the No. 18 Pontiac,
could manage only a 19th-place effort at 193.162 mph. ... Kenny
Irwin, last year's rookie of the year, struggled at 191.469 mph.
... Rookie Buckshot Jones of Tucker was at 189.641, while Bill
Elliott of Dawsonville was at 190.977 mph.

U.S. BEATS GERMANY, 3-0  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Bruce Arena closed the door to the U.S.
team's locker room, the sweetness of Saturday's upset of Germany
still new, and shouted, ``Today the best team won!''
</P>
<P>
   Arena, appointed head coach of the U.S. men's national team in
October, is trying to instill confidence in his revamped team, and
he wanted his players to understand that Saturday's dominating 3-0
victory before 17,259 at Alltel Stadium was no fluke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's result will be a surprise around the world,'' Arena
said later. ``It's not surprising in our locker room.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the U.S. men's team's first victory over Germany in
four tries. It was also a rematch of last year's World Cup opener,
which Germany won, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't seem to matter that just two players on each side who
started the World Cup game also started Saturday. Or that German
Coach Erich Ribbeck complained that his team had practiced for only
five days.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was thorough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a clear 3-0 victory,'' said midfielder Claudio Reyna,
the U.S. captain. ``It wasn't three lucky goals. It was three
well-deserved goals. And we honestly could have had more. We let
them know in the first minute that we were here to play and that we
weren't going to give them the respect we did in the World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our attitude,'' forward Cobi Jones added, ``was `Take no
prisoners.'''
</P>
<P>
   That pressure led to the three goals in a 10-minute span of the
first half. It left Germany facing a 3-0 halftime deficit for the
first time since 1993 when it played mighty Brazil in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuously, all three scorers are playing for German-based
teams.
</P>
<P>
   The United States began its scoring binge in the 16th minute,
when Jovan Kirovski dribbled past defender Markus Babbel, planted
and hit a perfectly aimed 22-yarder into the net's right corner. It
sailed just past goalie Oliver Kahn, who made a diving attempt.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to loosen up the hosts, who were not only playing
before a national U.S. television audience but upwards of 20
million on German television.
</P>
<P>
   In the 24th minute, midfielder Tony Sanneh electrified the
partisan crowd with a breakaway. He outmaneuvered German midfielder
Jens Jeremies for the loose ball and zeroed in on Kahn. The goalie
burst toward him to limit his angle, but Sanneh slipped a shot by
him on the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got there a little late and I just tried to go hard on the
tackle,'' Sanneh said of his collision with Jeremies. ``He didn't
go in so hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Now feeding off their success, the Americans added a third goal
just two minutes later. This one came on a wide-open six-footer by
Reyna, after a nifty combination of passing from Chris Armas to
Eddie Lewis to Reyna.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth goal was in the offing, but Kirovski's angle shot in
the 45th minute missed just to the left.
</P>
<P>
   Amid increased talk that the tradition-rich Germans are doomed
to world soccer mediocrity, they seemed to fit that role perfectly
Saturday. Far too often, they left gaping holes in which the United
States could maneuver. And their offense was virtually nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. goalie Tony Meola, the former MetroStar, had to stop only
eight shots, just one of which appeared threatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't much to do,'' he said. ``It was more organizing
things than making plays. But that's because our defense didn't
allow them to do much.''
</P>
<P>
   Arena found that the Germans' last nine goals had come from
accurate crossing passes, so he challenged two of his midfielders _
Sanneh and Lewis _ to shut down that aspect of Germany's offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very rare that U.S. players own the flanks in games of
this type,'' Arena said, ``especially against the likes of the
German team.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost 200 German journalists were here for the game. One asked
Arena how the Germans, considering their standing in world soccer,
could play so badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't say they played so badly,'' the coach said, a bit of
irritation in his voice. ``It's one of those days where everything
went right for us.''

   POUND RIDGE, N.Y. _ Casey was pretty relaxed. To be honest, he
was fast asleep under the kitchen table. This with mere days to go.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Smith was not relaxed. Questions raced through her head.
Were Casey's whiskers flat enough? What about his toenails? And how
were those teeth? He was known for his great teeth.
</P>
<P>
   She would get to those things. For now, she had to put Casey on
the treadmill.
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon, Casey,'' she said. ``Let's do our workout. C'mon,
boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey, who is almost 6 years old and a dog, is among 2,500
entrants competing on Monday and Tuesday at Madison Square Garden
in the 123rd annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, the premier
competition in the world of organized dogdom. Casey's event is on
Tuesday, when he will have about two minutes to convince the judge
that he is the most exquisite golden retriever on earth, or at
least the finest specimen among the 47 in the show.
</P>
<P>
   How well Casey _ formally known as Ch. Goodtime's Best Case
Scenario _ does in that fleeting moment heavily depends on what he
was born with, but it also takes punctilious grooming and
exercising. How effectively his owner, Ms. Smith, trots him around
the ring matters a lot, too. Understandably, many dog owners employ
professional handlers to tackle all the hard work. Ms. Smith, 33,
does it all herself.
</P>
<P>
   She lives in Pound Ridge in a white brick house with a golden
retriever mailbox, massive amounts of dog hair on the welcome mat
and a painting of Casey over the hearth. Her husband, Daniel
Selmonosky, is an investment banker who is a lot less interested
than she is in dog shows. He has a habit of alluding to them as
``the bottomless black hole.'' Besides Casey, they own six other
golden retrievers, three cats, tropical fish and a horse. ``I'm
threatening a parrot,'' Ms. Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   She put Casey on his ``Jog a Dog'' machine and twirled the dial
to top speed. As he chugged away, she egged him on. ``C'mon, Case,
that's it,'' she said. ``Go, Case.''
</P>
<P>
   Well into the 15-minute routine, Casey began to flag. Ms. Smith
delivered the ultimate expression of support. She sang the theme
song from ``Rocky.'' Casey picked up the pace.
</P>
<P>
   Finished exercising, Casey jumped onto the grooming table and
Ms. Smith worked on his coat. ``I'm removing hair where there is
too much,'' she said. ``Making it smoother. The hair is an ongoing
thing. I have to do more and more as we get near the show.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of constant shows, Casey is in semiretirement and
competes only in major events. His last show was in August. Being
off the circuit, Ms. Smith said, had turned him into a ``flab
muffin.'' In early December, she put him back on a regular exercise
regimen to ready him for Westminster.
</P>
<P>
   Two or three times a week, Ms. Smith tosses a ball with him for
a half-hour. Three times, she takes him for a three-mile walk,
though the walks have shortened as Ms. Smith has grown bigger. She
is seven months pregnant. And he goes on the treadmill five or six
times a week.
</P>
<P>
   He is bathed pretty much weekly, and then blow-dried with a
giant dog blow dryer that emits cool air at great force. Hot air
would burn his coat and skin. It takes two hours to dry him. ``I
hate blowing him dry,'' Ms. Smith said. For Casey, it's just one
more thing in a show dog's life.
</P>
<P>
   He eats twice a day, getting Eukanuba medium breed for puppies,
Eukanuba lamb and rice for adults, Nutro natural choice performance
food, Bill Jac ``fresh frozen'' food and Dog Bloom, a vitamin
supplement. Casey also gets table scraps, though he can't stand
onions.
</P>
<P>
   The dogs entered in this year's Westminster represent all 153
recognized breeds and varieties (Rhodesian Ridgebacks, schipperkes,
Portuguese water dogs, etc.) except, for no apparent reason, the
Finnish spitz. The entrants will be reduced by the judges to the
152 best in breed, which are then split into seven groups (i.e.,
the hound group, the sporting group, the working group). The seven
dogs anointed best in group then confront one another in the final
showdown for the best in show award. There's no prize money, just
ribbons, trophies and glory.
</P>
<P>
   The dogs are judged on conformation _ their looks and structure.
Attitude counts. Brains are fairly unimportant. There are no tricks
to perform as in obedience trials. (Casey, though, has a good head
on his shoulders; he has excelled at obedience, too.) The dogs must
behave, however. A dog that mauls a judge never does well. Casey is
extremely well behaved, though at one show, as the judge bent over
him to take a closer look, Casey burped in his face. Another time,
he relieved himself on a plant in the ring and still won, causing
Ms. Smith momentarily to rethink her ring strategy.
</P>
<P>
   For all the buildup of Westminster, it is over in a blink. Each
dog gets an ``individual,'' a once-over that lasts roughly two
minutes. The judge feels the dog and casts an appraising eye over
it, then tells the owner a pattern (triangle, down and back) in
which to ``gait it'' around the ring. ``It's a lot of work for two
minutes,'' Ms. Smith admitted.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   What constitutes dog perfection varies by breed. For golden
retrievers, the judge considers the straightness and firmness of
the back, and the quality of the muscle tone. The tail should come
to the hock of the leg. The ears should not be set too low, or else
water will get in when it swims.
</P>
<P>
   The golden retriever is a dog that is supposed to go out and
hunt all day, even if most of its hunting is done at a dog food
bowl. Hence the muzzle is supposed to be deep and wide enough to
carry a duck. (Casey more often carries a ball.) It should have
tight feet for efficient swimming and to insure that thorns don't
get between the toes when it is chasing fowl.
</P>
<P>
   Casey rates highly in all these categories, and he is excellent
at ``free stacking,'' which is standing in place without any
adjustments to his position by a handler. ``He has a lot of
attitude and he's very square,'' Ms. Smith said proudly.
</P>
<P>
   Even though her mother breeds dogs and did the dog show circuit
throughout her youth, Ms. Smith did not plan to enter the dog world
herself. She was born in Atlanta, where her father had a drum
reconditioning business. She moved north about 10 years ago. ``My
husband was working 100 million hours a week,'' she said. ``I
didn't know anyone. My mom sent me a dog.'' Before long, she began
showing the dog. Her mom sent her more dogs. It became a life
style.
</P>
<P>
   She started doing local shows in 1991, and in 1996 and 1997 she
campaigned Casey around the country. She worked as an accountant
and then as a counselor for at-risk children, but she quit to spend
more time with her dogs. Doing the circuit costs about $60,000 a
year, mostly for travel expenses and advertising. It is pretty much
obligatory that owners place advertisements in dog publications
like Dog News and The Canine Chronicle thanking the judge after a
dog does well at a show. These also help acquaint other judges with
a dog so they will be thinking highly of it in future competitions.
``It's promoting your product,'' Ms. Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Merely to enter Westminster, a dog must be an American Kennel
Club champion, meaning the animal has amassed 15 points at shows.
Casey attained that stature when he was 2. He has won one best in
show in Riverhead, N.Y., more than a dozen bests in group and
innumerable bests in breed. In 1996, he ranked No. 6 in the nation
among golden retrievers.
</P>
<P>
   This will be Casey's fourth go at Westminster. Twice he received
an Award of Merit, an honor bestowed on the top 10 percent of a
breed class, and Ms. Smith feels he narrowly missed winning best in
breed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, Ms. Smith took Casey to a handler's class in
White Plains for a final tuneup. The teacher, Joyce Diamond, called
out instructions: ``OK, let's move them in a triangle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, show me the bite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, take him straight down and back.''
</P>
<P>
   As she led Casey around the ring, Ms. Smith moved at a swift yet
refined trot, as if she and Casey were desperately late for an
appointment but still wanted to look good.
</P>
<P>
   The handlers held ``bait'' in their hand to get the dogs to do
the right thing. Ms. Smith employed Pup-Peroni, a jerky snack. For
the Garden, she will ``up the ante'' and go with liver. Anything is
permissible, short of live birds. A few handlers have been known to
use pheasant wings.
</P>
<P>
   At the Garden, nothing should be left to chance. The rings are
usually slippery. Ms. Smith plans to take a spritzer filled with
Coke and spray the pads of Casey's feet. The sugar affords him
traction. Some of the other owners favor 7-Up or Pepsi, but Ms.
Smith really likes Coke.
</P>
<P>
   She pays close attention to what she wears. Early on in her
showing days, she wore a red outfit and Casey got second in his
group, a red ribbon. She never wore red again. Instead she favors
blue, the color of a first-place ribbon, and purple, the color of
best in breed ribbons. And she likes black because Casey has won a
lot on her black days. She's going with black on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Casey gets nervous if Ms. Smith gets nervous, and the
Westminster show makes her nervous. So she will bring along mints
to suck on. ``It masks the adrenaline in your breath,'' she said.
``If Casey smells adrenaline, he gets worried about me. I don't
want him worried.''
</P>
<P>
   For Monday, the last chance to prepare, Ms. Smith has the day
all mapped out. ``I'll give Casey a bath and do the final
grooming,'' she said. ``I'll chop off his whiskers so he's flat.
I'll cut his toenails to get them as short as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey likes to turn in around 11 p.m., first hopping onto Ms.
Smith's bed and then settling onto the bathroom floor. But he needs
a good night's sleep. Ms. Smith will sequester him in the den at 8
p.m. and have him sleep on the couch there. On Tuesday morning,
there will be no breakfast. It's no good to trot around a ring on a
full stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's just hope for the best. Shaq from California would
have to be the favorite among the golden retrievers, since he ranks
first in the country, but sports are full of upsets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Casey won, I wouldn't go back,'' Ms. Smith said, gazing
lovingly at him. ``He would be done. I would be so happy I would be
beside myself. Casey would get a big steak for dinner. And I would
hope I don't fall on TV.''

KING'S SON TAKES POWER AS HUSSEIN LIES DYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ King Hussein's oldest son, Crown Prince
Abdullah, left the hospital where his father lay dying Saturday to
take an official oath giving him rule over Jordan's Hashemite
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   The short ceremony was the first official recognition that the
63-year-old, cancer-stricken monarch has, as longtime personal
physician Dr. Daoud Hanania put it, ``no hope of recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanania, who has been a close friend of the king for nearly a
half century, visited Hussein Saturday and said that the king was
kept breathing by a respirator. He said the massive kidney and
liver failure meant that the king's death was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   As Jordanians and the Hashemite clan that rules them prepared
for the loss of a beloved leader, Abdullah, 37, _ who until two
weeks ago was a commander of an elite military unit who never
expected to be king _ raised his right hand and read from the
Jordanian constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swear by almighty God to preserve the constitution and serve
the nation,'' he said during a small ceremony in the prime
minister's office with a life-size oil painting of his father
looming behind him.
</P>
<P>
   The oath technically makes Abdullah the regent of the royal
palace, or acting ruler. The swearing-in is usually a routine
procedure for the crown prince when the king leaves the country.
But it is the first time in 46 years of rule that Hussein has not
held the throne while he was in his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   And it is the latest step in the official succession of
Abdullah. For 34 years it was the king's brother, Prince Hassan,
who was made regent in the king's absence. That was until last
month, when Hassan was sacked by Hussein in a tumultuous week of
palace intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah, the king's oldest son, takes the reins of power in
this important Middle East nation as an inexperienced and untested
leader. But many palace observers say that Abdullah has inherited
the important qualities of his father. He is polite, caring,
straightforward, and unassuming _ traits that over decades
engendered trust in the king among heads of state from the Arab
world to Israel and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   There were some early signs of a lack of confidence in the young
king-to-be as Jordanians flocked to banks and currency exchange
shops to sell the local currency, the dinar, for US dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no need to worry. This is a country of solid
institutions and of continuity,'' Information Minister Nasser Judeh
said at a packed press conference.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton responded by bolstering the strategic US ally
in the Middle East. Clinton said he would ask Congress this week
for an additional $300 million in economic aid.
</P>
<P>
   While financiers might have had reservations about the future,
Jordanians from all over the country showed emotional support for
the king and his family.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,500 people from throughout Jordan flocked to the
entrance to the Al Hussein Medical Center. In the afternoon, Queen
Noor, accompanied by her son Hamzah, 18, passed through the crowd.
Her head covered in a white veil, she looked tired and shaken. But
she shook hands, smiled, and thanked people for their warm support
and concern.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd waved Jordanian flags and posters of the king, and
loudly chanted, ``God Save the King!''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout a cold, rainy day and into the night, the crowd
remained in a quiet vigil. Some held candles that flickered in a
raw wind blowing in from the desert. Men lined up for Muslim
prayers, holding their hands up to the heavens and praying from the
Koran. A group of Christian women gathered in a semicircle,
clutching beads and chanting the Rosary in Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the hospital, the king lay unconscious in a royal suite
that was specially designed for the family.
</P>
<P>
   Hanania, who is the former director of the hospital, was one of
the people outside of the family allowed to visit the king
Saturday. Hanania is a heart specialist and not on the team that is
treating the king. But as a personal physician to the king for 17
years, he provided insight into his grave condition.
</P>
<P>
   He said reports that the family was struggling to decide whether
to disconnect the respirator were false. He said the king still had
brain function, which could be determined because his pupils were
dilating and he still had some reflexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the absence of brain death, no one would think of switching
off the respirator. The philosophy is: Let nature take its
course,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors were not using dialysis machines to help his failed
kidneys to function because his lymcancer was too advanced, he
added. When asked whether the respirator could allow the king to
linger for weeks or months, he said, ``In theory, it could go on
for a long time. But if that is coupled with his general condition
. . . then the span, I would think from my experience, is days.''
</P>
<P>
   The king was kept heavily sedated. He lay dressed in a hospital
gown with the tubes of a respirator inserted in his throat and
pumping life into his lungs. He has regained consciousness only
intermittently since he was rushed home from Minnesota's Mayo
Clinic on Thursday after futile cancer treatments. The family said
that when he dies, they would prefer a burial within 24 hours, in
keeping with Islamic custom.
</P>
<P>
   The suite has an emergency care room where the king lay as well
as an operating theater and bedrooms. Queen Noor and Hamzah were
staying there to be with Hussein through the night. The decor is
simple with modern paintings adorning beige-colored walls. In dim,
soothing light, family members gathered in sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kissed his forehead,'' said Hanania, ``and said goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanania, who first met the king when they were teenagers
studying in London, said that it was fitting that the king was
spending his final days in the hospital where he showed so much of
his legendary kindness and generosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would call about a poor patient who needed surgery, an
ordinary shepherd or soldier, and he would check on him daily,''
recalled the former hospital director. ``He is sincere _ he doesn't
do it to be popularized. And therein lies his grip on this country.
It is his love of his people.''

IN LAST DAYS, MONARCH SOUGHT TO PASS ON LESSONS TO HIS SUCCESSOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ In the days before the cancer finally consumed
him and he was rushed home, King Hussein played chess with his son
Hamzah.
</P>
<P>
   The cancer-stricken monarch spent hours early last week sitting
up in his hospital bed in Minnesota's Mayo Clinic, staring at the
chessboard and focusing on each move. Palace sources say it was
cherished time with his 18-year-old son, and it took the king's
mind off the pain.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed a poignant closing image for the king's life: A dying
patriarch was using the chessboard to pass on the wisdom and the
sense of strategy that the next generation will need to lead this
pivotal Middle East nation.
</P>
<P>
   Crown Prince Abdullah, who was sworn in Saturday as regent of
the kingdom, hopes he has learned those lessons from his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that I can live up to His Majesty's dignity and virtue
that he has had with his people. I think that this is the secret of
ruling Jordan,'' the newly designated heir said in his first
interview with American reporters on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just an extension of His Majesty's policies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some palace watchers say the chess metaphor may also be an apt
one for a man who, in the end of his life, so dramatically
maneuvered the pawns, knights and queens of his own family.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Jordan's Hashemite dynasty must prepare to lay down its
king, questions have begun to swirl over what the succession will
mean for the palace, for Jordan, and for the region.
</P>
<P>
   In his interview, Abdullah stressed that he would continue to
``honor'' Jordan's peace agreements with Israel despite Jordanians'
rising impatience with the failure of the economic benefits of
peace to materialize. He recognized the need to focus on Jordan's
economy, which has remained stagnant for two years, and which
already suffered a ripple of anxiety Saturday with a drop in the
value of the Jordanian currency.
</P>
<P>
   As the king's death appears imminent, according to his doctors,
the next few days will undoubtedly ``bind the family together in
sorrow,'' said Fahed Fanek, a columnist.
</P>
<P>
   A palace official said of the family: ``They are very unified in
their sorrow. All of the divisions wash away in the face of the
tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the following months, royal watchers predict that the
royal family dynamics will play out for the ascendant Crown Prince
Abdullah, the deposed Crown Prince Hassan, the US-born Queen Noor,
and her oldest son and the king's favored successor, Hamzah.
</P>
<P>
   As Abdullah himself put it, ``The future of the Hashemites, the
future of Jordan, are intertwined.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the king chose Abdullah, his oldest son by his
second wife, to succeed him. But most palace watchers believe the
king would have preferred Hamzah, his oldest son by his fourth
wife, Queen Noor, as successor. The king simply did not have enough
time or strength at the end of his life to make the constitutional
changes that would have been required for Hamzah to take over. And
the king came to realize that Hamzah, at age 18, was too young,
palace sources said.
</P>
<P>
   A looming question is whether Abdullah will follow tradition and
keep his first-born son, now 3 years old, to be crown prince. Or,
will he, as his father did for 34 years, appoint a brother, in this
case his half-brother Hamzah, to be crown prince? Article 28 of
Jordan's consitution allows him that right, if Parliament approves.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Hamzah will finish his studies at Britain's Sandhurst
military academy and is expected to become crown prince under
Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   The passing of the crown to Abdullah is not considered likely to
mean an end to the reign of Queen Noor. Formerly known as Lisa
Halaby, the American-born and Princeton-educated queen became a
symbol throughout the world for her grace and beauty and her
commitment to causes such as ridding the world of land mines. She
has mingled easily with the world's glitterati, and is not expected
to exit from the limelight. The Hashemites may well leave Noor her
title. And then the question will be: Is Jordan big enough for two
queens?
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah's wife would presumably also be crowned queen, palace
watchers say. If so, for the first time in Jordan's history, a
Hashemite queen will be of Palestinian descent. Princess Rania, the
striking and sophisticated wife of Abdullah, will be a new face for
the world, and the pride of Jordan's large Palestinian population.
Her role would be symbolic, but important politically in the
delicate relationship between the Palestinians and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Hassan's fate is perhaps the most uncertain. For more
than 30 years, the erudite 51-year-old brother of Hussein was the
heir to the throne, until the king's dramatic announcement that he
was changing his succession.
</P>
<P>
   That announcement followed a tumultuous week of palace intrigue
last month that resulted in Hussein writing an uncharacterisically
scathing letter to his brother explaining why he would not be king.
Hassan was so deeply affected by the decision that he, according to
the Arab newspaper El Bayan, handed the king a pistol and said,
``Shoot me if I have betrayed you.''
</P>
<P>
   The king will leave behind a palace _ of two brothers and 12
children by four wives _ struggling to regain stability after a
single monarch's rule for nearly a half century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has happened so fast, there has not been time for
factions to develop within the family,'' said one former palace
official. ``But they will have to be careful not to allow all of
the forces vying for power to disrupt the unity of the family. That
could easily destabilize the kingdom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think they are aware of what is at stake,'' he added.
``I think His Majesty made sure they were.''

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Reflecting on a 9-8 loss to Texas yesterday,
Southern California coach Mike Gillespie offered a succinct
analysis of his team's weekend thus far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, frankly, that we are all embarrassed by our defense
and our bases on balls,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For a while it seemed as if the defending national champions had
traded in the wooden bats they used on Friday for wooden gloves in
this one.
</P>
<P>
   Canceling a 14-hit attack of their own, the Trojans (1-2)
committed five errors to hand Texas (4-0) seven unearned runs, then
fell short with a late rally before a crowd of 4,978 at Disch-Falk
Field. The final in the three-game series is scheduled for 1 p.m.
today.
</P>
<P>
   The teams used aluminum bats, but nothing could rescue the
Trojans from themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Texas took a 2-0 lead in the second inning on Mike Pumo's single
after USC starter Barry Zito _ who was a third-round pick of the
Rangers last year _ loaded the bases with a hit and two walks.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans had a solo home run in the fourth, but missed a
chance to tie the game when third baseman Beau Craig was called out
for tagging too early on a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Cal unraveled in the bottom half when left fielder
Dominic Correa dropped two fly balls, and Texas shortstop Jason
Moore capped a four-run inning with a blast over the 375-foot sign
in left center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was the third most-surprised person in the stadium
when that happened,'' said Texas coach Augie Garrido, celebrating
his 60th birthday, ``after the kid that dropped the fly balls and
Coach Gillespie. But I was happy.''
</P>
<P>
   In defense of Correa, who had three hits, including a two-run
homer, Gillespie said, ``Those may have been the first two fly
balls he's ever seen in his life. He's an infielder, but we're so
banged up we had to use him out there.''
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, Zito departed after misplaying a short tapper and
a sacrifice bunt and walking in a run. The Longhorns got another in
the seventh on two errors by shortstop Seth Davidson, playing with
a protective mask over a healing broken jaw.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans rallied for seven runs in the final three innings _
including three in the ninth _ but closer Phil Seibel struck out
second baseman Justin Gemoll with two men on to save it for the
Longhorns.

SERBS, ETHNIC ALBANIANS HEAR A PLEA AND AN IMPLIED THREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMBOUILLET, France _ Talks aimed at ending the fighting in
Kosovo got under way Saturday night as ethnic Albanian and Serbian
negotiators were urged to feel both the weight of history and the
threat of NATO military intervention should the efforts fail.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac, whose summer residence in this castle
town southwest of Paris is the setting for the talks, told the
delegates that history would judge them harshly if they did not
find a compromise to end the bloodshed that has taken 2,000 lives
and uprooted more than 300,000 people in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   New violence rocked Kosovo even as the negotiations opened. A
bomb exploded outside an ethnic Albanian-owned vegetable market in
the provincial capital of Pristina Saturday, killing three people,
The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   In the room the negotiators were sitting, Chirac said, Charles
de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer, Germany's first postwar chancellor,
mapped out the idea for a new, united Europe that had been
destroyed by two world wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``This war in Kosovo is unacceptable ... as Europeans,'' Chirac
said. ``Freedom, democracy and tolerance must be the three
principles on which this peace is built.''
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to the Serbs, Chirac stressed that the determination of
the international community to find a solution is not aimed against
one group. But Chirac, his foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, and
the British foreign secretary, Robin Cook, pointed out repeatedly
that the negotiations were backed by the UN Security Council, the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is
monitoring the conflict, and NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac urged the negotiators to show courage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Courage doesn't take one in the direction of war,'' he said.
``There is a greater courage, the courage to accept the need to
negotiate. Be assured, when you leave Rambouillet, a page in
European history will have been turned. The world is watching. The
world is waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   The wait was longer than expected. While the Serbian delegation,
led by a deputy prime minister, Ratko Markovic, arrived in Paris on
Friday, the ethnic Albanians were delayed by a day.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: Serbian authorities had refused to allow two members
of the ethnic Albanian separatist group, the Kosovo Liberation
Army, to board the French government plane in Pristina, because
they did not have passports. The 14 other members of the ethnic
Albanian delegation refused to go unless the two Kosovo Liberation
Army members were allowed on. After some frantic diplomacy, most of
it French and British-led, the passport problem was resolved and
the ethnic Albanians flew off for Paris Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a news conference, Cook and Vedrine, who will chair
the talks, played down the setback.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, so good,'' said Cook, who considered it a victory
merely to get everyone here to begin the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Cook and Vedrine rejected suggestions that the international
community was imposing a settlement in Kosovo, and that the
delegates are being asked to rubber-stamp something already drawn
up.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cook and Vedrine acknowledged, however, that Christopher
Hill, the special US envoy to Kosovo, and his European Union
counterpart, Wolfgang Petritsch of Austria, had put together a
framework document based on four months of discussions with the
warring sides.
</P>
<P>
   After Chirac, Cook and Vedrine gave what amounted to a pep talk
to the two delegations, the delegates met separately with Hill,
Petritsch and a Russian diplomat, Igor Mayorsky. Those three will
mediate the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Hill and his colleagues are trying to get the ethnic Albanians
to put aside their separatist agenda, and to get the Serbs to
accept that Kosovo needs to return to the autonomy it had before
the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, unilaterally ended it
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for giving the ethnic Albanians control over
their domestic affairs, but it stresses that Kosovo will remain a
Serbian province, putting off the question of Kosovo's status for
at least three years.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators will work secluded from the world's media, which
has descended upon this quaint town 35 miles southwest of Paris.
Cook said that he and Vedrine would give the six-nation Contact
Group, which manages the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, a
progress report on Friday. Cook hinted that if progress was being
made, the negotiators would be given a few extra days to reach an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But Cook and Vedrine stressed that the international community
will not sit idly by if the negotiators are unable to reach
agreement. NATO intervention seems inevitable, either to police a
settlement, if one emerges, or to bomb Serbian targets if the
killing resumes.
</P>
<P>
   Security here was intense. Elite French policemen in full-length
leather coats eyed passersby suspiciously and checked the
undercarriages of cars for bombs.
</P>
<P>
   There were hundreds of Kosovo Liberation Army supporters in
evidence, holding banners and flags and chanting, ``Oo-chic-ka!''
which in Albanian means UCK, which is Albanian for KLA.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators will be isolated from such provocative partisanship.
Instead, they will be asked to appreciate the history of the
Chateau of Rambouillet, where Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette once
frolicked.
</P>
<P>
   Cook referred to the history of the place when he noted that the
English had attacked the castle three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Successfully, I might add, Hubert,'' he said, turning to his
French counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said the experience of the French and the British _ ancient
enemies but now close allies who are sponsoring these peace talks _
serves as a lesson to the ethnic Albanians and Serbs.

EAST TIMOR FEARS TROJAN HORSE IN INDONESIA INDEPENDENCE OFFER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Twenty-three years after Indonesia invaded East
Timor and began a bloody rule, the former Portuguese colony has
never been closer to gaining independence.
</P>
<P>
   But Timorese leaders who have risked their lives for a chance at
self-rule _ the topic of UN-sponsored talks beginning here Sunday _
say they do not want independence: at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been so focused on raising public awareness about our
cause that we didn't seriously think about the structure of a
government,'' said Constancio Pinto, an advocate of independence
who began his struggle as a 14-year-old guerrilla in the Timorese
jungles. ``This is what we have been fighting for, but what happens
after independence?''
</P>
<P>
   What happens, he fears, is a replay of transitions to
independence by Portugal's former colonies from Guinea to Angola:
chaos followed by decades of civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Pinto, now 36 and a graduate student at Columbia University,
agrees with other Timorese independence advocates who say they need
a three- to five-year transition to ease the birth pangs of
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Their hesitation to embrace Indonesia's offer _ some see it as a
threat _ of independence underscores the key dilemma for the
Timorese. With no experience governing or maintaining order, the
Timorese still must rely on Indonesia to guarantee a smooth
transition to self-rule.
</P>
<P>
   But Indonesia is willing to lend a hand only if the Timorese
agree to surrender considerable control over police, defense and
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no obligation to prepare the people of East Timor to
walk towards their independence,'' Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas said Friday. ``We are not colonialists.''
</P>
<P>
   Portuguese and Indonesian diplomats have reached agreement over
a blueprint for an autonomous Timorese government, according to
Pakistani diplomat Jamsheed Marker, the UN mediator overseeing the
talks. But the two sides remain at an impasse over whether the
arrangement would will lead to independence.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign ministers of Portugal and Indonesia will try to
agree on a plan to disarm thousands of civilian militia members
responsible for carrying out a crackdown on Timorese residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have now arrived at an understanding as far as we can go,''
said Marker, adding that negotiations were expected to intensify
over the next several weeks. ``The curtain has come down on the
first phase our negotiation and is about to go up on Act II.''
</P>
<P>
   East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, has lived under harsh
Indonesian military rule since the Portuguese left in 1975 and the
Indonesian troops invaded. It was annexed by Jakarta a year later,
an act that has not been recognized by the United Nations. More
than 200,000 Timorese have died under Indonesian rule, human rights
advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of Independence for East Timor has always been a
sensitive issue in Indonesia, whose national motto is ``Unity in
Diversity.'' The leaders of this fragmented nation composed of
13,000 islands, 300 ethnic groups and more than 350 languages, have
long feared that Timorese independence would energize separatists
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is East Timor the thread that unravels the ball of Indonesian
national integrity? Can East Timor be an economically viable
state?,'' asked Adam Schwartz, a lecturer at Georgetown and Johns
Hopkins universities. ``We don't have a good answer to either
question. But East Timor has been poor under the Portuguese, poor
under Indonesia, and it will probably be poor under the East
Timorese.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest violence was prompted by the surprise Indonesian
decision on Jan. 28 to grant immediate independence _ and it has
cast a pall over the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-government militias armed by the military have clashed with
Timorese civilians, leaving more than 30 dead, driving more than
6,000 people into hiding and raising the specter of another
bloodbath.
</P>
<P>
   One militia leader, Kansio Lopez, acknowledged last week that
his forces had used weapons on loan from the army to kill 10 rebel
sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesia military, with 10,000 troops in East Timor, insist
that the militias were being armed to protect themselves from
pro-independence rebels if Jakarta pulls out of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Pinto and other Timorese independence advocates, who have been
meeting with UN officials on the sidelines of the New York talks,
accuse Indonesia of intentionally fomenting turmoil to frighten the
Timorese into abandoning their drive for full independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indonesia is trying to create another civil war,'' Pinto said.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Ramos Horta, Timorese opposition leader who won the Nobel
Peace prize with Timorese Bishop Carlos Belo in 1996 for their
autonomy efforts, appealed to the Timorese for calm. He said he has
had discussions with the United Nations over a proposal to send UN
observers and truce forces to East Timor to disarm the militias and
to ensure a safe democratic transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The East Timor people need not panic,'' he said. ``We can
invite the United Nations to take responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's approval would be required before the UN
peacekeeping operation could be created. While Jakarta's has yet to
approve it, US officials pressed the government to consider a UN
presence in East Timor to check the worsening violence.
</P>
<P>
   It would ``break the cycle of violence and restore confidence,''
said a US assistant secretary of state, Stanley Roth, who met with
Indonesian officials last week.
</P>
<P>
   Roth also expressed optimism that the impasse can be cleared.
``I have been working on East Timorese issues for 19 years,'' he
said. ``This is the first time in that 19-year period that I am
optimistic that there is a basis for a political settlement.''

SENATE VIEWS LEWINSKY TESTIMONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica S. Lewinsky emerged on videotape Saturday at
the center of President Clinton's impeachment trial, as House
managers played her recorded testimony for the Senate and millions
of television viewers in an effort to bolster their case.
</P>
<P>
   The session thrust the House managers and Clinton's lawyers into
harsh conflict over Lewinsky's account of circumstances stemming
from the source of the impeachment saga: her sexual affair in the
White House with the 42d president.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing Clinton of engaging in ``a broad tapestry of
corruption,'' Representative James F. Rogan, a House manager from
California, argued that Lewinsky's testimony had underscored ``why
a just and proper verdict in this body would be to replace him as
president with Vice President Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour presentation by the House managers, and a 2
1/2-hour rebuttal by Clinton's lawyers, constituted the entire
witness phase of the impeachment trial, and represented the last
act of the proceedings before both sides deliver closing arguments
Monday. Deliberations will follow, leading to vote on Thursday or
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyer, Nicole Seligman, argued that Lewinsky's
testimony had ``undermined'' Rogan's assertion, and had proved that
``the opposite is true.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have distorted, they have omitted, and they have created
a profoundly erroneous impression,'' Seligman said of the
presentation, which also featured video clips of testimony by
Clinton, his friend Vernon E. Jordan Jr., and White House adviser
Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   With the Senate considered certain to acquit Clinton of the
impeachment charges, Saturday's debate had the air of an empty
exercise. Still, the videotaped presentations gave the House
managers and White House lawyers one of their last chances to sway
public opinion and a small number of wavering senators.
</P>
<P>
   For Lewinsky, the session marked the first time she has been
seen publicly telling her version of the yearlong scandal. Wearing
a conservative black outfit and a pearl necklace, Lewinsky spoke
confidently but carefully in the video excerpts about her knowledge
of Clinton's alleged perjury and obstruction of justice in trying
to cover up their affair.
</P>
<P>
   Her testimony inspired widely varying reviews from the senators
who will decide Clinton's fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American public has seen Monica Lewinsky for the first
time as Monica Lewinsky, not as the White House would want you to
see her,'' said Senator Larry E. Craig of Idaho, chairman of the
Senate Republican Policy Committee. ``It certainly has been
devastating to the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts said the session
provided scant new information and was ``a total waste of the
Senate's time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This may play very well on television to have Monica Lewinsky,
but the people back home will be able to watch Monica Lewinsky on
Barbara Walters if they want to,'' Kennedy said. ``This is just a
blatant and flagrant partisan effort to demean the president,
embarrass the president, humiliate the president, and poison the
political atmosphere, and it's basically inexcusable.''
</P>
<P>
   In styles as different as their positions, the House managers
patched together a pastiche of short video clips to hammer home
their points, before Clinton's lawyers countered with relatively
lengthy excerpts of Lewinsky and Jordan rebutting the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   The images filled four large video monitors in the Senate
chamber and television screens around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers launched their presentation by juxtaposing
the image of Lewinsky taking an oath last week to testify
truthfully in her deposition with and a clip from Clinton wagging
his finger last year and denying he had engaged in ``sexual
relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene set the foundation for the House managers to unfurl a
flurry of video snippets to support their charges that Clinton had
manipulated Lewinsky, Jordan, Blumenthal and others in his alleged
coverup. The clips presented no surprises, because complete written
transcripts were released Friday of the Lewinsky, Jordan and
Blumenthal depositions.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan said the video presentation illustrated that Clinton had
failed to learn that one ``bad choice,'' his adulterous affair with
Lewinsky, might lead to more bad choices if he ignored the
potential consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``That simple primer on life encapsulates the political and
personal legacy of Bill Clinton,'' Rogan said. ``His is a
continuing pattern of indulging all choices and accepting no
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats accused the managers of lashing out in
frustration as the House case against Clinton fades into history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we suffered the excessive zeal of managers who don't
understand that we're very familiar with the facts, and that this
is not going to change any votes,'' said Senator John F. Kerry.
``What we did was participate in a Republican effort to impact
public opinion, and it's inappropriate for the Senate to be used
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers, Seligman and David E. Kendall, each played
video clips that showed Lewinsky rebutting every major allegation
against Clinton, including charges that he had encouraged her to
file a false affidavit and conceal evidence to thwart a sexual
harassment lawsuit that Paula Corbin Jones filed against him and
settled for $850,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The testimony of Ms. Lewinsky has seriously damaged the
managers' case and confirmed that it is time for this tireless
pursuit of the president to come to an end,'' Seligman said.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment charges narrowly passed the House in December,
largely along party lines. But the House managers have continually
lost ground in the Senate, and several GOP senators said privately
that as many as 15 Republicans may join all 45 Democrats in voting
against the perjury charge.
</P>
<P>
   The obstruction allegation is considered the stronger of the two
counts, but even that charge may not receive 50 votes, far fewer
than the 67 required to remove a president.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise move, Senator Robert C. Byrd, a West Virginia
Democrat, said in an interview to be broadcast Sunday that he
believes Clinton's actions constitute high crimes and misdemeanors,
although he did not say how he will vote. Byrd last week had filed
a motion to dismiss the case against Clinton, but it was defeated.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during Saturday's presentation, Representative
Lindsey O. Graham of South Carolina suggested that Clinton's
wrongdoing had included a phone call to Lewinsky at 2:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where I come from, if you call somebody at 2:30 in the
morning, you're up to no good,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Senators burst into laughter, but Graham maintained a straight
face as he gazed at his notes.
</P>
<P>
   With polls showing the public is eager for the trial to end,
Senate leaders have tried to hasten the process. Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist joined them Saturday, as he rebuffed the
Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, when Lott suggested taking a
break.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's keep going,'' Rehnquist said, interrupting Lott and
drawing applause.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the Senate chamber, senators continued to haggle over a
way to sanction Clinton without removing him from office. Democrats
united behind a draft censure resolution that would cite Clinton
for ``shameless, reckless and indefensible behavior'' that could
create ``disrespect for the laws of the land.''
</P>
<P>
   But only three Republicans had expressed support for the plan:
Senators John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, James M. Jeffords of
Vermont, and Robert F. Bennett of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Other senators were waging a struggle to open the final
deliberations to the public. It would take 67 votes to change the
rules that require the closed-door deliberations, and senators in
both parties said the outcome is too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   Each senator will have up to 15 minutes to speak during the
deliberations.

CLIPPERS PREPARE FOR BULLS RUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Video reviewer and first-year Clipper coach Chris
Ford has seen the tape and had praise for the production values.
</P>
<P>
   But he'd prefer to change the ending.
</P>
<P>
   When the tape of Friday's opener with Phoenix had ended, the
Suns rode off into the moonlight with a 101-92 victory. According
to Ford's review, there were too many chase scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get better conditioning,'' said Ford, who watched
as his frontcourt was left in the dust by the fast-breaking Suns'
frontcourt. ``We need our bigs to be able to run the floor. You're
not covering your man if you're shoulder to shoulder. We've got to
be out ahead of him.''
</P>
<P>
   To correct this problem, the Clippers rehearsed sprinting up and
down the court during Saturday's practice at Veterans Park
SportsComplex in Carson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to have any more jogging up and down the
court,'' Ford promised.
</P>
<P>
   OLD GUARDS RETURN
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's game with Chicago provides a Sports Arena return for
ex-Clipper guards Ron Harper and Brent Barry. Harper left the team
after the 1993 season to succeed the retiring Michael Jordan as the
shooting guard in Chicago. Barry, who was traded to Miami last
season, recently signed with the Bulls to do the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   They scored 18 and 13 points, respectively, in Friday's
season-opening loss at Utah.
</P>
<P>
   MICHAEL AND THE BULLS
</P>
<P>
   Ford, who was pleased with the first-game performance of Michael
Olowokandi, said the rookie center could get more minutes against
the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on how it goes,'' Ford said, ``but he may get more
time. I think he was very patient Friday in making his moves.''
</P>
<P>
   In 22 minutes against Phoenix, Olowokandi scored 14 points,
grabbed six rebounds and blocked a shot.
</P>
<P>
   SHERMAN'S TANK LOW
</P>
<P>
   Newly acquired point guard Sherman Douglas looked a cheeseburger
or two beyond fighting trim in Friday's opener, which arrived one
day after the nine-year veteran did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, he's not there yet,'' Ford said of Douglas'
conditioning, ``and he knows it. He'll get there soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas had two assists and no points in four minutes against
the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   While he works into game shape, Darrick Martin will continue to
run the team. Martin had 11 points and six assists in his matchup
with the Suns' Jason Kidd, but most of that damage was done in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Darrick did a great job,'' Ford said.

NATION SEES POLITE, POISED STAR WITNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vixen or victim? When the nation saw and heard
Monica S. Lewinsky for the first time Saturday, it wasn't so clear
that the world's most famous White House intern is either.
</P>
<P>
   The polite, poised, and pearled woman on the videotape played at
the Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton didn't resemble
either the desperate, lovesick child dumped by the man she derided
as ``The Big Creep,'' or the giddy presidential stalker who craved
phone sex with a guy she nicknamed ``Handsome.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from an occasional shy grin, wistful look, or chin-jutting
pout, Lewinsky was the perfectly composed and coached witness who
appears well on her way to recovering from one awful year and
looking for rehabilitation from all the terrible things that have
been said about her.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't, of course, the woman House managers trying the case
against Clinton really wanted in the spotlight. An innocent young
victim, manipulated and destroyed by a deceiving president, was the
Monica they had hoped to portray.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica Lewinsky is an intelligent, articulate young woman who,
until recently, held untarnished hopes for tomorrow, like any other
recent college graduate,'' Representative James Rogan, a California
Republican, told senators Saturday as he introduced excerpts of the
videotape. ``That hope was drastically altered when she was
subpoenaed in a lawsuit against the president of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogan repeatedly called Lewinsky ``Monica,'' while referring to
the other videotaped witnesses, Clinton's friend Vernon E. Jordan
Jr. and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal, as ``Mr. Jordan'' and
``Mr. Blumenthal.''
</P>
<P>
   The subtle message, delivered to a Senate where the average age
is over 50, was not of disrespect for 25-year-old Lewinsky, but to
highlight her youth.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she didn't look that young. For her videotaped
deposition, taken in the presidential suite of the Renaissance
Mayflower Hotel last Monday, Lewinsky chose a black V-necked dress
with a strand of pearls. No baseball cap, no beret with a shiny
hatpin, and certainly no Gap logos or labels.
</P>
<P>
   Her appearance, too, was more come-of-age than teenage: Dark
liner circled her wide brown eyes, and a helmet of shiny black hair
framed her face. Her smile, though infrequent, was warm and
engaging, and her gestures _ including scratching her nose _ seemed
natural.
</P>
<P>
   In manner, however, Lewinsky was all business. This is, first of
all, a woman who has recounted her affair with the president 23
times and knows her subject. She also is represented by two of
Washington's most respected defense lawyers, Jacob Stein and Plato
Cacheris, and it was clear from Lewinsky's occasional glance their
way that they were coaching her from the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   But the most striking contrast was between the serious,
confident witness and the delusional, emotional Valley Girl who
described herself as ``sooooooo naughty'' on the telephone tapes of
former friend Linda R. Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   In the portions of the videotape played Saturday on television
and on four large monitors in the Senate, Lewinsky's choice of
words was careful, her responses clipped. ``Correct,'' she answered
over and over again. And her behavior was unfailingly polite,
addressing as ``sir'' the House manager who, with the others, had
demanded that she testify.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Lewinsky's smooth delivery was downright soothing
compared with the fractured questions of Representative Ed Bryant,
the Tennessee Republican and House manager whose interrogation of
Lewinsky is heard but not seen on the tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica doesn't come across as stupid or silly, but rather as
focused, thoughtful, and someone who knows what she wants to say
and says it,'' said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst at
the Claremont Graduate University in California, who got up early
to watch the Senate trial. ``She is neither an innocent, vulnerable
child nor some kind of vixen. She is a woman who seems to me fully
understood what she was doing and weighed the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffe said Lewinsky did not hurt the president's case, even
though White House lawyer Nicole Seligman blasted the House
managers, who she said took the videotape and ``cleverly snipped
here and there'' to distort her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The president's defense team ran longer excerpts of the Lewinsky
video to bolster their case that the president had not obstructed
justice by telling Lewinsky to lie under oath about their
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors and the defense obviously intended to leave that
relationship alone, but Lewinsky could not help but recall it, with
some tenderness, from time to time in her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   How did she respond when Jordan had asked if she were a friend
of the president's? ``My memory right now is I said something about
seeing him more as a man than as a president, and I treated him
accordingly,'' Lewinsky told Bryant softly.
</P>
<P>
   How did she respond when Jordan suggested she was in love with
the president? ``I probably blushed or giggled or something,''
Lewinsky said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   And was it unusual for the president to phone her at 2 a.m.?
Lewinsky, in a word, answered: ``No.''

SENATORS' VERDICT ON THE VIDEOS: A COLLECTIVE YAWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It had all the makings of a theatrical coup d'etat:
Monica S. Lewinsky, center screen, her voice echoing through the
silent Senate chamber as her face lit up four video displays. After
a year, the dark-haired former intern was going to come alive.
</P>
<P>
   But when House prosecutors finally pushed ``play'' on her taped
deposition, there were no explosive reactions on either side, no
senators bursting outside to express a change of heart. Many had
watched tapes of the witness earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   And though some senators gave favorable notices to Lewinsky
early Saturday afternoon, by the end of the day, even her girlish
nods and crisp answers seemed to bore many.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched all the tapes, so it's sort of a rerun for me,''
admitted Senator John Warner, a Republican from Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The only excitement involved another witness, former White House
aide Sidney Blumenthal, who testified that he never told reporters
that Lewinsky was a ``stalker'' when the story about her affair
with President Clinton broke.
</P>
<P>
   In a sworn affidavit released late Saturday, journalist
Christopher Hitchens contradicted that testimony, saying Blumenthal
used the word ``stalker'' several times over lunch on March 19,
1998. Hitchens, who writes for Vanity Fair and The Nation, also
swore Blumenthal said ``that the President was `the victim' of a
predatory and unstable sexually demanding young woman.''
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit could cause problems for Blumenthal. But even as
it circulated throughout the Capitol, members on both sides
acknowledged it was unlikely to alter the outcome of the
impeachment trial, and may not even be admitted into the public
record unless the trial rules change. At times, the presentations
of videotaped depositions seemed to have just as little effect.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon, as video clips were interspersed with arguments
on both sides, senators appeared largely underwhelmed. During
Blumenthal's deposition, Senator John H. Chafee, a Republican from
Rhode Island, was dozing off. Senator Arlen Specter, a Republican
from Pennsylvania, yawned repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   As the last segments of Lewinsky tape were played, more than a
dozen Democrats were absent from their seats. Senator Patrick J.
Leahy of Vermont called it ``cruel and unusual punishment'' to have
to sit through the testimony. More than once, Senator Joseph R.
Biden of Delaware leaned over his desk to chat with Senator John F.
Kerry of Massachusetts, who laughed and rolled his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find this whole thing incredibly boring,'' Biden, said
during a break, ``incredibly out of whack, incredibly useless.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he weren't just a little bit curious, Biden replied:
``Zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the afternoon, many senators emerged like amateur
critics at a movie preview, eager to offer vague descriptions of
what they did or did not like.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Chuck Hagel, a Republican from Nebraska, said the video
presentation of spliced remarks, which strung together the
testimony of three witnesses and of President Clinton, was ``very
strong, much more effective than the written depositions.'' Senator
James M. Jeffords, a Vermont Republican, said the videotapes
``helped with their presentation very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Many said the videotapes were at least intriguing, and predicted
they would give the public a fuller picture of the former intern _
a perspective senators have been gaining over the last week,
viewing the tapes in private.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Fred Thompson, a Republican from Tennessee, said that
``when you've heard so much about a person, and then for the first
time you see that person, you're probably going to have different
feelings about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most offered positive reviews of the star witness herself,
sizing her up largely as ``decent'' and ``intelligent.'' Senator
Frank Lautenberg, a Democrat from New Jersey, was one of the few to
raise his eyebrows when asked his impression, saying he ``got the
feeling she was relatively unsophisticated and trying to help the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, said she's a ``decent
person . . . and not just because she spent all that time in
Oregon,'' where Lewinsky attended college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she has her heart in the right place, with that health
care program, for example, that she was involved in,'' Wyden said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the outcome of the Hitchens affidavit remained
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   According to Representative Bill McCollum, one of the House
prosecutors, the impeachment rules preclude managers from entering
it into the public record. For that to change, he said, it would be
``up to the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island, said the
affidavit was ``collateral at best'' to the impeachment trial,
although he did admit that Blumenthal could be investigated or
prosecuted by the Justice Department later on. Leahy dismissed the
statement altogether, saying, ``We're getting statements coming
over the transom.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, senators watched the testimony in question.
Blumenthal denied being a source for reporters on the negative
characterization of Lewinsky, saying, ``I have no idea how anything
came to be attributed to a White House source.''

GOOD NEWS FROM KANDI-GRAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After one week of gritty research into basketball
dialects, we have made the translation to NBA-speak and decided
that ``O-lo-wo-kan-di'' does not mean ``La-Rue Mar-tin.''
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't mean ``Ben-oit Ben-ja-min.''
</P>
<P>
   But it does mean the Clipper curse will be adjusted to define
the profane mutterings of disappointed critics, crestfallen
comedians, and opposing centers who must deal with the rising
potential of the NBA's No. 1 draft choice.
</P>
<P>
   The professional name, for those of you whose tree houses are
not pulling in that illegal cable feed, is Michael Olowokandi. And
he means business.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, based on seven days of inclusive scrutiny, we are here to
insist the 7-foot rookie from Pacific will not become the buster
that was LaRue Martin. Martin was the Loyola of Chicago terror
chosen No. 1 overall by Portland in 1972. The halcyon days of LaRue
were as brief and substantively bankrupt as ``The Magic Hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Better still is Olowokandi's habit of arriving at the arena with
an appropriate sneaker for each foot, eliminating comparisons to
Benjamin, the Clippers' unfortunate choice at No. 3 overall in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   Can we summarize our pique by designing a corresponding movie
title? Not a problem. Let's go with ``Forget Italy.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy is where Olowokandi suited up for his first six
professional games, recording alarming averages of 7 points and 5
rebounds in action limited by his employer's knowledge that the
23-year-old soon would be leaving for the NBA. It also should be
underscored that in what passes for European hoop savvy, the player
assigned to the low post is little more than a prop.
</P>
<P>
   So those who embraced wire reports that condemned the Kandi Man
as another Clipper catastrophe without witnessing his game
themselves should drop by the Sports Arena this evening. The
Clippers are matched with the Chicago Bulls, whose bench rotation
could allow Olowokandi to test the defensive power brought to light
by Bill Wennington.
</P>
<P>
   OK, dancing on the skull of ground-bound centers such as
Wennington and Luc Longley (Friday's unwitting foil) is not enough
to quantify success. So we'll list quickness, strength, footwork,
resilience, desire and sound coaching as reasons why Olowokandi
should be the building block that holds up the Clippers' curve at
the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   And the kid seems remarkably wise, which will allow him to know
where to stand when that expected anvil falls from the Clipper sky.
</P>
<P>
   BOARD SILLY
</P>
<P>
   So, Laker fans have decided the name ``Dennis Rodman'' has a
certain ring to it.
</P>
<P>
   They realize the Worm has done more quality and highly
publicized rebounding than anyone this side of Elizabeth Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   But do they realize the Chicago Bulls were able to weather his
attention-hugging storm because Rodman could identify with the
coach, Phil Jackson, who happens to be a reconstituted hippie?
</P>
<P>
   Do they realize Jackson erred on the side of karma when Rodman
missed a road game with the ``flu'' just one night after spending
an evening throwing back kamikazes in a Chicago bar?
</P>
<P>
   Do they know Jackson sent Rodman home from New York when the
party-worn Worm arrived for the morning shoot around looking like
death eating a cracker?
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls had maturity, something the Lakers have yet to be
accused of.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers fans remember how Rodman's dyeing circus temporarily
ruined the San Antonio Spurs? Yeah, Dennis was golden in Detroit,
but that was before he brought his ego to the wrong alter.
</P>
<P>
   Old Pistons coach Chuck Daly was interested in bringing Rodman
to Orlando, but with Bo Outlaw around, there seems to be no need to
hire a (feather) boa outlaw.
</P>
<P>
   ROOKIE REVIEW
</P>
<P>
   The hits among first-year players on opening night:
</P>
<P>
   Boston forward Paul Pierce (Inglewood High, Kansas) scored 19
points and grabbed nine rebounds in a loss to Toronto. His Raptors
counterpart, the athletically freaky Vince Carter (North Carolina)
had 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   Sixers guard Larry Hughes (St. Louis) had 11 points and nine
rebounds in 16 minutes; Raef (Fear spelled backward) LaFrentz
(Kansas) had 11 and 7 for the Nuggets (LaFrentz may not be strong
enough to excel at center or quick enough to defend power
forwards); Michael Dickerson (Arizona) had 15 points against the
Lakers, and Sacramento point guard Jason Williams (Florida) had 21
points in his debut.
</P>
<P>
   The misses:
</P>
<P>
   Dallas forward Dirk Nowitzki (Germany) started, played 16
minutes, scored two points and had no rebounds. Seattle's Jelani
McCoy (UCLA) was one of several rookies who spent Friday as a
spectator.
</P>
<P>
   SHOT-CLOCK VIOLATIONS
</P>
<P>
   Among post-lockout disappointments is Vancouver center Bryant
``Pig Country'' Reeves, who reported to camp with 41 spare pounds.
It has been speculated that Reeves spent much of January eating the
food passed over by teammate Shareef Abdur-Rahim during Ramadan.
... Former Long Beach State star Bryon Russell has been slowed by a
groin injury, but started and scored 15 points in Friday's win over
Chicago. According to sources in Utah, the groin injury did not
occur on the last play of Michael Jordan's career. ... Tony Battie,
who had one of the shortest Laker careers in team history, started
at center for the Celtics in their opener vs. Toronto. Kevin
Willis, who started for the Raptors, had 28 points and 16 rebounds.
... In his Denver debut, ex-Laker Nick Van Exel missed 9 of 15
field-goal attempts.

SENATE VIEWS VIDEOTAPE OF LEWINSKY'S TESTIMONY
<TEXT>
<P>
   By GREG McDONALD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica Lewinsky made her long-awaited appearance in
the Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton Saturday,
testifying on videotape that she did lie about her affair with the
nation's chief executive but that it was not part of a plan to
obstruct justice as House prosecutors charge.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful deposition from the poised young woman, who wore a
single strand of pearls while she was being questioned under oath,
seemed to reinforce arguments by Clinton's defense team that she
was not coached to lie for him and he did not try to buy her
silence with a job.
</P>
<P>
   Her image appearing on four large TV monitors set up in the
Senate chamber, Lewinsky seemed to answer the questions put to her
calmly, sometimes smiling and sometimes looking pained by the
descriptions of her relationship with Clinton, for whom she
confessed she still has ``mixed feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I would deny the relationship,'' she said at one point,
seeming to confirm the prosecution's charge that the president
persuaded her to testify falsely about their affair. But in another
excerpt played by Clinton's lawyers, Lewinsky emphatically denied
that Clinton encouraged her to lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would remember something like that, and I don't,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is extraordinary testimony. Why? Because she corroborates
the president,'' Clinton attorney Nicole Seligman told senators as
both the House prosecution and defense teams began their closing
arguments in the first impeachment trial of a president since 1868.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides will conclude their presentations on Monday, and
the Senate could vote on whether to convict or acquit Clinton of
perjury and obstruction of justice charges by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her assertions that Clinton did not try to manipulate
her, Republican prosecutors contended that Lewinsky's personal
views of his conduct have nothing to do with ``what was in the
president's mind'' when he was trying to hide their illicit
relationship from lawyers in the Paula Jones sexual harassment
lawsuit and from independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   They insisted that he used everything and everyone at his
disposal in a ``sinister scheme'' to keep their relationship
private.
</P>
<P>
   To support those allegations, they also presented videotaped
depositions from Clinton friend Vernon Jordan and White House aide
Sidney Blumenthal, who both testified that the president did indeed
mislead them about his relationship with the former White House
intern.
</P>
<P>
   Taken all together, the prosecutors argued, the testimony
clearly shows the president sought to manipulate the people who
were closest to him so they would present a picture of his
relationship with Lewinsky that he knew to be false.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president wove a web of perjury and obstruction of
justice,'' said Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., who led off as the
House prosecution began its final arguments.
</P>
<P>
   In his presentation, Rogan described Clinton's relationship with
Lewinsky as that of a ``predator'' whose conduct amounted to sexual
harassment in the workplace. Declaring that Clinton ``impulsively
began using her for his gratification the very first day he spoke
with her,'' Rogan said Clinton later tried to use her to help him
stonewall the Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Under normal circumstances, Rogan told the senators at one
point, Clinton's conduct might be viewed as nothing more than an
attempt by a wayward husband to hide an extramarital affair. But he
contended that it progressed to much more than that because Clinton
tried to get Lewinsky to lie under oath for him and lied to
Blumenthal and Jordan, knowing that they might be called as
witnesses and repeat what he told them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to keep in mind that we seek no congressional
punishment for a man who chose to cheat on his wife. However, we
have a legal obligation to expect constitutional accountability for
a president who chooses to cheat the law,'' Rogan told the
senators, who are expected to vote next Thursday or Friday on
whether to remove Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   In their arguments, which will continue on Monday, prosecutors
are making one last attempt to convince the Senate that the House
was right to impeach Clinton on charges of committing perjury and
obstruction of justice. But so far there is little indication that
they will be rewarded for their efforts by garnering the 67 votes
needed to convict and remove Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, senators appeared to focus more of their
attention on how best to censure Clinton for his conduct than
whether prosecutors had presented enough evidence to warrant
removal. The Democrats hoped to win support for a proposal they
were floating that would declare the president guilty of
``shameless, reckless and indefensible behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   A second bipartisan proposal also was being floated by Sens.
Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Robert Bennett, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Both proposals could be offered at the conclusion of the trial.
But some Republicans, though interested in finding the president
``guilty of something,'' as one put it, said censure would be too
weak a punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, for instance, joked with reporters
that it would amount to no more than ``a pat on the butt.''
</P>
<P>
   The senators, as they have done throughout the trial, rushed to
the cameras after Saturday's proceedings to provide their spin on
the day's events.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the president described the prosecution's
videotaped presentation as ``political theater,'' aimed at saving a
case that is now unsalvageable. In the end, they said, the
videotaped excerpts only bolster the president's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think minds were probably changed, but you never
know,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa., praised prosecutors for
doing ``a very credible job.'' He said the White House defense
amounted to ``attacking the messenger instead of the message.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a view prosecutors were well aware of as they walked
the Senate through what they contended was a conspiracy to commit
crimes orchestrated by the president, regardless of what Lewinsky,
Jordan and others thought about it.
</P>
<P>
   In a final plea for support, Rep. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., told
senators that he knew House prosecutors had been an irritating
presence in the chamber for the last month and had saddled them
with a terrible dilemma that everybody wants to be over. He called
on them to vote their consciences, but said he could see no other
outcome than for them to declare to the American people that ``our
president'' had committed crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants this over so bad you can taste it, including
me. But let's don't leave a taste behind that history cannot
stand,'' Graham said. ``No fair-minded person in my opinion could
come to any other rational conclusion than that our president
obstructed justice, that our president committed perjury in front
of a grand jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers, who had been opposed to the airing of the
videotaped depositions, ended up using greater portions of them,
particularly Lewinsky's, than the prosecution to make their case
that Clinton committed no crimes.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, they showed a Lewinsky excerpt denying outright
the prosecution's contention that she and the president discussed
how she would file a false affidavit in the Jones case. Seligman
accused the prosecutors of taking excerpts from the tapes out of
context.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have distorted, they have omitted, and they have created
a profoundly erroneous impression,'' Seligman said.
</P>
<P>
   Then in a direct slap at the prosecutors, she accused them of
trying to build a circumstantial case against the president to
perpetuate a partisan campaign to bring Clinton down that began
from the first moment he was elected to office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for this timeless pursuit of the president to come
to an end,'' she said.

REAL PEOPLE ON TAPE FUEL RARE FASCINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Shortly after 10 a.m., after senators were stunned
by news that a beloved legislative clerk had been killed by a car,
and after a chaplain prayed for divine guidance, four flat-screen
televisions placed strategically in the Senate chamber filled with
the visage of Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In the galleries, a cross-section of America collectively leaned
forward. After a buildup comparable to the coming release of the
new ``Star Wars'' movie, Lewinsky was finally on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Students from Walton High School in Marietta, Ga., visiting
Washington under a program designed to give teenagers a
``close-up'' look at government, got as close as any student of
history could get to a presidential impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really surprised,'' said Jennifer Brezel, 17, one of the
Walton students. ``She was supposed to be this bimbo. I thought she
was really intelligent.''
</P>
<P>
   If interviews with those who watched the videotaped deposition
in the Senate galleries are an indication, the impeachment trial of
President Clinton came to life Saturday in a way that perhaps it
had not since the story first broke a year ago. While the senators
are familiar with the details of the case, it was evident that many
others watching thought they were hearing key information for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   They were impressed when Lewinsky testified that the
presidential secretary, Betty Currie, had called Lewinsky before
collecting gifts the president had given to Lewinsky _ a key to the
House managers' case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It confirmed my belief that he obstructed justice,'' said
Christy Steinhauser of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph Quarles, a Maryland teacher and a Clinton supporter,
said an afternoon of watching video testimony had more impact on
him than anything he had heard before. Until Saturday, he said,
``we have only been able to read about it.'' Saturday, he said,
``it was visual. You can hear it, see it, feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarles expressed bewilderment after watching the testimony of
the White House aide, Sidney Blumenthal. Blumenthal described how
the president had denied having sexual relations with Lewinsky, and
said Clinton had rejected Blumenthal's advice to stay away from
``troubled people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My perception now is a little skewed,'' Quarles said,
referring to his view of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when the White House defense team had its chance to air
video clips more favorable to the president, the reaction toward
Clinton improved. In one clip, for example, Lewinsky was seen
saying the president had never told her to lie in her affidavit
denying sexual relations with Clinton. ``He didn't discuss the
content of the affidavit with me at all, ever,'' Lewinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   That was persuasive to Kevin Norman, a George Washington
University student. ``I was very impressed by the defense,'' he
said. ``It proved that Clinton was not incriminating himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Even among those who thought Clinton was guilty of the charges
against him, many said they still did not want him removed from
office.
</P>
<P>
   The day began on a somber note, as senators learned that Scott
Bates, the Senate's legislative clerk, had been killed Friday night
while walking across the street in a Washington suburb. Bates had
been in the Senate longer than most senators, starting as an intern
in 1970 and eventually rising to legislative clerk. Earlier last
week, as has been his job for years, Bates's booming voice was
heard calling the roll on the vote that allowed the videotaped
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Bates's chair in the well of the Senate was empty, a
black ribbon draped across it. A vase of flowers was placed at his
desk. The loss of his familiar voice had brought Senate employees
to tears.
</P>
<P>
   Amid this atmosphere, the Senate abruptly turned on the
televisions, and the voice of the young woman who had an affair
with the president of the United States filled the chamber.

ON BALANCE, CONSTITUTION IS HOLDING UP,   EXPERTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the Senate moves this week toward the conclusion of the
impeachment saga, many historians and legal scholars see a glimmer
of good news.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that the constitutional process, devised 212 years ago,
still works.
</P>
<P>
   By allowing a simple House majority to impeach President
Clinton, it let a president accused of serious crimes be held to
account. By mandating agreement by two-thirds of the senators, it
evidently will protect him from being thrown out of office on a
partisan vote and against the wishes of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   And if politics was a key reason for President Clinton's
impeachment journey, the Constitution _ by making Congress rather
than the courts his navigators _ seems to have ensured politics
will end it.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how ugly it has been, no matter how cumbersome,''
said Jeffrey Abramson, a professor of legal and political studies
at Brandeis University, ``it testifies to the brilliant structural
mechanisms conceived by the Founding Fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the academic debate about whether the document should be
read literally or reinterpreted with time, constitutional scholars
said its language about impeachment had proven problematic but
effective.
</P>
<P>
   By not defining ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' more precisely,
for instance, it permitted the rancorous debate that has framed the
second trial in history to eject a president. But by erecting high
hurdles and leaving the task to Congress, the analysts said, the
Constitution accomplished its core aim of making removal
exceedingly difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of Clinton's trial, most Americans would
agree that his impeachment, at a minimum, has damaged his place in
history. And to the extent that his critics want him punished,
analysts said, at least that much had been accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   The Founding Fathers considered placing the process in the
courts. If they had gone the strictly legal route, the allegations
of perjury and obstruction of justice might have posed a greater
danger for Clinton losing his job.
</P>
<P>
   By infusing the process with politics, however, they allowed for
the possibility of his staying in office even if a majority of his
judge-jurors _ the 55 Republican and 45 Democratic senators _
ultimately believe he committed serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are politicians, with considerations quite apart from
determining guilt or innocence,'' said Robert H. Bork, a
constitutional scholar and former federal judge whom President
Reagan nominated to the Supreme Court and who was rejected in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us might not like the outcome, and I certainly don't,
but that's the way it's playing out . . . and it's certainly a
result of the fundamental decision by the framers to leave this in
the hands of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal and political analysts stressed that the Constitution's
authors did not foresee many developments, such as television, that
have reshaped the political world since they wrote the government's
guiding document. In terms of the impeachment process, several
changes have particular significance: the growth of a two-party
political system, and the election of the Senate by popular vote.
</P>
<P>
   Because large, well-organized parties did not exist when the
Constitution was conceived, most authorities believe its barriers
were designed to protect a president from ``factions'' that might
band together. At the same time, since senators were appointed by
their states' governors or legislatures, they were intended to make
judgments without directly factoring in the constituent pressure
that House members were meant to feel.
</P>
<P>
   The development of opposing parties, coupled with the 17th
Amendment in 1913, making the Senate an elected body, deeply
changed American politics.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, even as they praise the Constitution for its
enduring wisdom, many historians and constitutional scholars are
disheartened by the six months of proceedings on Capitol Hill.
Although the system appears to have worked this time, the
impeachment sends ominous signals for the future.
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps their harshest criticism, many analysts say the House
has set far too easy a standard for succeeding presidents.
</P>
<P>
   There is disagreement among the experts, as there is within the
Congress and the public, about whether the charges against the
president rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors. But
for the majority who believe they do not, there is a gnawing fear
that an unintended precedent has been set.
</P>
<P>
   The fear is that members of both parties, when upset about
political defeats or the personal behavior of a president of the
opposing party, will feel freer to attempt impeachment if they hold
a majority of seats in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that the Senate follows its present course and does not
eject Clinton from the Oval Office, the analysts said, this process
may have the effect of making future US representatives act with
even fewer constraints. They could think, for example, that they
could politically entangle and personally embarrass the chief
executive, without risking a constitutional crisis, because his
removal was rendered so unlikely by the Constitution's two-thirds
vote requirement in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Senate is going to continue to refuse to remove
presidents,'' said Alfred Rubin, a legal historian at the Fletcher
School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. ``But I see a real
danger . . . that the House . . . is going to want to gain
political advantage . . . by simply bringing up charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin and others said that prospect appeared to be heightened by
the ideological chasm between, and the solidarity within, the
Democratic and Republican Parties.
</P>
<P>
   Two factors could reduce the chances of this pessimistic
prediction coming to pass.
</P>
<P>
   First, many if not most members of both parties have talked for
years about amending the law on special prosecutors. After the $40
million-plus investigation by Kenneth W. Starr, it appears that a
majority is ready to kill the statute this year.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, future lawmakers will be denied the resources
that the House Judiciary Committee relied upon to build its case
against Clinton. That would not necessarily prevent legislators
from pursuing another president, but their work would be harder.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the disapproval of the Republicans' drive may act as a
deterrent for politicians down the line, particularly if that
disapproval translates into GOP losses in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest May, a political historian at Harvard, said the
two-thirds requirement in the Senate is so imposing a political
``restraining force'' that it will be nearly impossible to remove
any president. May doubted that a 67-senator majority could have
been gathered to oust Richard Nixon if he had not left voluntarily
because of the Watergate scandal.

   A politician less adept or less ``shameless,'' he said, might
have taken the same route rather than fight the battles or suffer
the humiliations that this president has.
</P>
<P>
   May suggested that if the charges are serious enough, and if the
public outcry is sufficient, only the House impeachment process
itself can realistically force a president's departure _ through
resignation. He argued that the House should therefore take its
responsibility far more seriously than it has in this case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to see what public service is served by having an
impeachment that cannot lead to conviction,'' May said. ``The only
excuse for it would be that it was, in fact, a response to a broad
public demand. But it was not . . . so one could be tempted to
concluded that the motivations were political.''

BRUINS MAKE A POINT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ With little to show the last three weeks but
frustration, frayed nerves, and splintered confidence, the Bruins
left here Saturday with a 2-2 tie against the mighty Philadelphia
Flyers. A point earned. Some battle fatigue diminished. An ounce of
confidence regained.
</P>
<P>
   Paced by Sergei Samsonov's two goals _ his first strikes in a
month _ the Bruins stayed on the cusp of playoff contention by
cutting down the Flyers' high-fliers: Eric Lindros, John LeClair,
Mikael Renberg, Rod Brind'Amour et al. The Bruins are now a grim
1-8-3 in their last 12 games, but at least for an afternoon, they
found a way to cope and compete with one of the NHL's biggest,
strongest, most successful contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the game plan, you know,'' said Boston captain Ray
Bourque, after logging his requisite 35-plus minutes. ``We wanted
to battle, be strong _ do that, and hopefully you survive. We were
able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   With the postseason approaching, it's all about hanging on now.
The second half has been nothing short of disastrous for a club
that last season righted itself after its worst season in 30 years.
They began Saturday parked in ninth place in the Eastern
Conference, 2 points behind the Panthers for the No. 8 _ and final
_ playoff spot in the conference, a jumble of pieces poured out of
a jigsaw puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``All points now are good,'' said coach Pat Burns, his club able
to manage leads of 1-0 and 2-1 before settling for the tie. ``You
have to put 'em away now, like squirrels putting away acorns. Put
'em away and save 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Samsonov scored his first of the afternoon (No. 16) at 2:23 of
the first period, connecting on a stuff at the left post after
linemate Jason Allison hit Ron Hextall with a backhand sweep. The
lead, rare for Boston these days, held up through the first period,
as the Bruins outshot the Flyers, 12-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not come out with guns blazin', '' said Lindros.
</P>
<P>
   It took the Flyers, with only one loss in their previous 23
games, until 13:53 of the second period to knot it. Chris Therien
grabbed a loose puck near the right corner, curled out from above
the near circle and beat netminder Rob Tallas with a 20-foot
wrister.
</P>
<P>
   The day's outcome might have been different had P.J. Axelsson
been able to convert on a breakaway at 8:10 of the second. Sent in
alone from just outside his offensive blue line, the scrappy
checker closed to the doorstep and tried to slide a forehander
through Hextall's five-hole. But Hextall, subbing for No. 1 John
Vanbiesbrouck, made a quick drop and turned it back.
</P>
<P>
   Samsonov struck for the 2-1 lead with 29 seconds to go in the
period, this time left with acres of open net after a Bourque blast
from above the right circle was blocked. The ricochet came to
Samsonov in the slot and he popped in a high forehander before a
diving Hextall could regain position in the crease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Effort hasn't been our problem,'' said Burns. ``What we've
lacked is some goal scoring.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers were able to dodge the loss when Lindros popped in
his 29th at 5:22 of the third period. Standing on the goal line to
Tallas's left, his back to the rearboards, he shoveled a backhander
toward net that eluded Tallas on the near side. Just as Lindros
flicked his wrists, Hal Gill closed in and the puck popped off
their two blades and into the net. If not for the deflection, the
2-1 lead might have stood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was square, and I thought I had a good chance,'' said
Tallas. ``The view I had, I thought he was going to the far side
(right post). But it just got deflected.''
</P>
<P>
   Now come the Rangers, who visit FleetStreet Sunday afternoon.
Two of the conference's cellar-dwellars, looking to stay in the
playoff hunt. The season is getting late, available points fewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this game can only help us,'' said Bourque. ``We went
out and battled hard, and have a point to show for it. Now we've
got to feed off that.''

BRUINS NEED MORE THAN A MINOR REPAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ New parts arrived on the team charter here Friday
afternoon. In times of trouble, the Bruins turned their lonely,
losing eyes to Cameron Mann and Antii Laaksonen, a pair of Baby B's
tossed back into the tailspin that had the Bruins a moribund 1-8-2
as they took on the swashbuckling Flyers Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Remember a couple of weeks back, when coach Pat Burns said this
was no time for auditions? Well, ring the gong, because it is now.
</P>
<P>
   The front office badly miscalculated the club's depth last
summer, opting not to pursue trades or sign free agents, believing
that Burns could wring even more out of the lot that made it to
last year's playoffs. Almost two-thirds of the way into the 1998-99
season, the Bruins still don't have a legitimate second line, and
the blue line suddenly looks in dire need of a facelift. The need
was there in August, but no one was paying attention, the euphoria
of a decent 1997-98 season hiding many ills.
</P>
<P>
   Will an infusion of AHL youth save the season? Doubtful. If any
of the Providence kiddie korps truly impressed Burns in training
camp, it wouldn't have taken him until early February to agree to
give the likes of Laaksonen and Mann another look. Now with a
playoff berth in the balance, and the varsity in deep decline,
they've got to step in and make a real impact? It's an extremely
unreasonable expectation. In fact, if they can step in and
contribute significantly in these conditions, it will underscore
another miscalculation (i.e. shouldn't they have been here
earlier?).
</P>
<P>
   Burns may now look obstinate, waiting this long to acquiesce and
call up some fresh, young legs. But, in most cases, he has had two
training camps to judge all contestants, and his eye is sharp
enough to know who's ready for The Show, who needs more seasoning,
who won't make it past the threshold.
</P>
<P>
   The bet here is that nothing the Bruins have in the AHL today is
going to influence the outcome in Boston. Getting back Kyle McLaren
(shoulder) will help immensely, but in two weeks the Bruins could
be 6-8 points out of a playoff spot. Looking for a miracle to come
rolling up Route 95 now is folly.
</P>
<P>
   The cruel lesson of January-February '99 is that Harry Sinden
and Mike O'Connell have to go out this summer and find a handful of
legitimate NHLers, three or four forwards and one or two
defensemen. Said another way, they are one line and a defensive
pair away from really getting in the game. It's too late to be
looking for all that now. Way too late.
</P>
<P>

   More living proof that expansion drafts aren't stocked with so
many loads of coal: The Ducks last week inked netminder Guy Hebert
to a three-year pact worth $11.9 million. The 32-year-old
Duckstopper was claimed off the St. Louis roster in the '93
expansion round. Remember, too, that Dominik Hasek, now making $7
million in Buffalo, went unclaimed in that same draft. With Hebert
and Patrick Roy (two years/$14.5 million) now signed to new deals,
there won't be an elite netminder available in this summer's free
agent swap meet, which could pad the accounts of Kirk McLean, Chris
Terreri, and Arturs Irbe . . . Don't be surprised to see the
struggling Capitals, on course to miss the playoffs after reaching
last year's Cup final, unload some high salaries with the March 23
trade deadline approaching. Ex-Bruin Adam Oates would be a prime
candidate. He'd be a good fit in Phoenix, where he could anchor a
No. 2 line, perhaps with old pal Rick Tocchet on his wing. Buffalo
also would make sense for Oates. The Sabres could do a lot with a
center _ any center . . . The Red Wings might know this week
whether defenseman Uwe Krupp will require season-ending back
surgery. Meanwhile, the rumor mill churns, with the Wings possibly
getting Mark Tinordi from Washington for Mathieu Dandenault.
Another possibility is Brendan Shanahan getting dealt to New
Jersey. Shanahan's numbers are down (37 points/50 games into
weekend action), and he doesn't have the kind of grit normally
expected of a true power forward. Shanahan's first four seasons
were spent at Exit 16W, prior to his going to the Blues as a free
agent in '91 . . . Before taking over in Vancouver, Marc Crawford
took the standard coaching sabbatical and worked as a color
commentator in Canada (like Microphone Mike Milbury at ESPN). ``I
liked the job,'' said Crawford. ``But I didn't think as a coach,
because I was too busy thinking of things to say. And there were
always guys yelling in my ear, `Wrap it up, wrap it up.' '' . . .
Last week's GM meetings in California didn't produce anything that
rattled the boards. The subject of tie games came up, as expected,
but there was no grassroots support for a tie-breaking format
(shootouts, etc). The subject isn't dead, but the debate isn't
lively.
</P>

   No one knows how the financial morass in Pittsburgh will shake
out, but keep in mind that Jaromir Jagr's salary will increase by
nearly 100 percent, to $8.9 million, next season, and then top out
at just over $10 million in 2002-03. If the Penguins are going to
stay in Pittsburgh, it may come at the expense of having to deal
Jagr, which would lead to some creative trade packaging. The guess
here: a couple of established, very young players, and perhaps as
many as five first-round draft picks. To wit: Boston would have to
part with the likes of, say, Kyle McLaren and Sergei Samsonov, and
also give up the handful of picks. Jagr turns 27 next Monday. Wayne
Gretzky was 27 when the Oilers realized in the summer of '88 that
they couldn't keep paying him. The Oilers acquired three of LA's
first-round selections in that swap, as well as Jimmy Carson and
Martin Gelinas and $15 mililion out of Bruce McNall's wallet . . .
Bob McCammon got knocked around in a limo crash last week, along
with ex-A's hurler Dave Stewart and Darren Flutie, brother of Doug
Flutie. The three passengers were on their way to a charity dinner
in Thunder Bay, Ontario (McCammon's hometown), when the limo was
hit broadside by a car at an intersection. The only one hurt was
McCammon, who suffered minor facial cuts. ``It was frightening
sight to see Dave Stewart coming right at my face,'' said McCammon,
who is No. 2 man in charge at IHL headquarters . . . John Buyck on
the lost art of hip checks: ``No one these days has a big enough
rear end,'' said an amused Hall of Famer. ``I don't know what it
was. It was just my game.'' Bucyk landed a high percentage of his
upending hip checks around the net the Bruins were attacking. As an
opponent was forced behind the net by one of Bucyk's linemates,
attempting to carry out the puck, a charging Chief would sting him
with the powerful body slam as he attempted to curl out from behind
one of the posts. ``That was the key, you've got to get the other
guy to force him around,'' said Bucyk. ``Once he couldn't go back,
that's when you'd get him. Timing's important. You'd have to make
sure you didn't miss him, or you'd look really stupid.'' . . .
Colin Campbell, the NHL's director of discipline, now thinks he was
``too lenient'' when he suspended the Coyotes' Dallas Drake for
four games for the ugly check placed on LA's Doug Bodger Dec. 28.
Bodger missed six games with a sprained neck. ``I'm not perfect;
I'll admit it,'' said Campbell. More appropriate would have been
something upwards of 20 games, mirroring what Dale Hunter got for
his hit on then-Islander Pierre Turgeon . . . Ex-Bruin Glen Murray,
recovering from a wrenched knee, skated Thursday for the first time
since being hurt. He could be back in the Kings lineup in a couple
of weeks, at least a month ahead of schedule . . . Another
ex-Bruin, good guy Garry Galley, played in his 1,000th NHL game
Monday night in Philadelphia. His wife, Terri Lynn, welcomed him
home with no fewer than 1,000 roses. His kids, Shaylynn and Wyatt,
gave him portraits of themselves dressed in LA sweaters.

   Ex-Flame Hakan Loob, now GM of a club in Sweden, wants to return
to North America someday and work in an NHL front office. He has an
18-year-old son, Henrik, eligible for this year's draft (at the
FleetCenter). Loob, at age 28, went home to Sweden after connecting
for 50 goals with the Flames, preferring that his children attend
Swedish schools. Nicklas Lidstrom, Detroit's standout defenseman,
said recently that his NHL days are coming to a close. He, too,
wants his children raised back home . . . It doesn't get much
uglier than the 10-1 pounding the Lightning suffered Wednesday
night at the hands of the Capitals. Washington exploded for seven
goals in seven minutes en route to an eight-goal second period. For
the record: The Sabres hold the mark for most goals (9) in a period
(the second) when they pasted the Leafs, 14-4, at the Aud on March
19, 1981 . . . Ottawa goalie Ron Tugnutt was thrilled to be at the
All-Star Game, making it a point to attend all parties and even
visit the NHL fantasy show. He took his turn at the slapshot
exhibit, and walked away pleased that he nailed an 85 m.p.h.
slapper. ``That's great,'' said Boston captain Ray Bourque, when
Tugnutt told him about his big hit, ``but my 10-year-old just
nailed one at 78 m.p.h.'' . . . Mike Keenan, now off the job in
Vancouver, packed up with his wife and went to watch some games in
Switzerland. Meanwhile, the buzz around Edmonton is that Ron Low
may be at the end of his tenure behind the Oiler bench (his deal
expires this season). ``I don't think he should be fired,'' wrote
one fan in an Edmonton newspaper poll. ``Let the players experience
what it's like to be coached by Mike Keenan for a few games. Then
the players might start appreciating Ron Low a little bit.'' . . .
Mighty Ducks trainer Greg Smith, also the club masseur, underwent
surgery last Sunday to fix the cracked cheekbone he suffered when a
flying puck nailed him the night before at Edmonton. Despite the
obvious pain, Smith finished out his shift. ``And (Paul) Kariya
never missed a massage,'' said one Duck . . . Word around Buffalo
last week was that Matthew Barnaby was about to be dealt. By week's
end, the Sabres' instigator was still under the employ of Niagara
Frontier Hockey (DBA the Sabres). When Barnaby is on his hard-nosed
game (seen rarely since 1996-97), virtually every NHL team would
want him. But his trademark nastiness is all but gone these days,
which makes him little more than a spare part . . . Slava Fetisov,
now an assistant coach in New Jersey, picked up Stanley Cup ring
No. 2 when his ex-Winged Wheels visited the Meadowlands on Monday.
This is Fetisov's first year in tie and jacket and friends say he's
feeling the itch to play again. The chances of that are slim. He'll
be 41 in April and he was used sparingly last year, although he
suited up for 21 playoff games . . . Best Super Bowl chuckle: The
FedEx ad that showed the Stanley Cup mistakenly being delivered
``Somewhere in Bolivia'' while a bunch of irate Red Wings chased a
red-faced, empty-handed NHL executive down ice after clinching the
even-more-elusive silver bowl . . . When Pavel Bure's new deal is
written up in Florida, the $47 million will be paid out over five
years in installments of $8 million, $9 million (two years), $10
million, and $11 million . . . Trevor Linden looked like he was
skating in a fog when the Islanders played here Thursday night. It
was only a year ago Saturday that Linden was dealt from the
Canucks. He can be a much better player, which is the frightening
truth in regards to about two-thirds of that lineup . . .
Unsubstantiated but interesting nonetheless: recent rumors that had
Vancouver's Mark Messier being swapped to Dallas for Joe Nieuwendyk
. . . How much would you be willing to give up for Theo Fleury? The
Bruins have to be asking themselves that a lot these days. The
Rangers, at FleetStreet Sunday afternoon, are expected to make a
heavy pitch for the Flames' little fireball, and it could be a deal
for Fleury that proves the difference between the Bruins or
Blueshirts making the playoffs.

DEATH OF SKIER,14, LEAVES CHILL IN AIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARREN, Vt. _ On the ride up the Sugarbush Mountain chairlift
for his first warmup run, Dan Cardillo was doing what any young ski
racer would do on race day. He was talking, excitedly. His race was
a Super-G, the fastest event short of a downhill race, in which he
would be going about 50 miles per hour. The course was full length,
much longer than courses usually run by his eighth-grade age group,
and Cardillo, 14, was talking about how much fun such a long run
would be, and about the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who do you think the top skier in the race is?'' Stephanie
Peters recalled him asking her. ``I think it's Sam Beck. I wonder
if I can beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He always had a goal like that, a goal he was working
toward,'' said Peters, a classmate of Cardillo's at the Waterville
Valley Ski Academy, one of several boarding schools sprinkled
across the New England mountain ranges for aspiring gifted skiers.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the last time anyone talked with Cardillo. Wearing
a helmet, he took off down Birdland, a narrow intermediate trail
used frequently by recreational skiers, though the mountain was
fairly empty on this Tuesday morning 12 days ago, with maybe 30
other racers on the same trail doing practice runs.
</P>
<P>
   Cardillo picked up speed down Birdland to a junction that
connected to a lower trail, a road with a hard left turn. The
conditions on the trail were loose granular, created by a tiller
pulverizing an icy surface that had been resulted from heavy rains
on Sunday followed by a fast freeze. Skiers agreed that the trail
surface was well-prepared, though hard _ a condition that racers
favor because of the speed potential.
</P>
<P>
   Cardillo was going 30, maybe 40 miles per hour when he angled
out high and wide to the right side to get a better angle on the
turn. In an instant, he was very close to the tree line, and
somehow _ maybe his edge got caught in the snow, maybe it hit an
ice chunk _ he was out of control, careening off the lip of the
trail edge and into the trees.
</P>
<P>
   Ivar Dahl, who works for Voekl skis and Technica boots, had been
skiing with the racers and was the first to reach Cardillo, who had
hit a tree, full force.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was going at a high GS speed,'' Dahl said, ``and he didn't
slow down. It would have been impossible for him to slow down.''
</P>
<P>
   As Dahl and ski patrolmen placed Cardillo into a rescue
toboggan, he was unconscious. There was a pulse, and he took
oxygen. But they would soon discover that his spine was broken in
two places, several ribs were broken, and his lungs were punctured.
Cardillo died during the trip to nearby Berlin Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Ski racing deaths are rare, but there is a sense of fatalism
about Dan Cardillo's death. Among skiers, school and race
officials, and even his family, no one is attempting to lay blame.
</P>
<P>
   Three other deaths in New Hampshire that day, and another one at
Sugarbush Friday, were attributed to skiers losing control on the
slopes _ but ice is part of skiing, they say. And yes, the kids
were encouraged to ski fast in warmups, because that's what the
sport is all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here was a kid who just did not know death existed,'' said Ken
Cardillo, Dan's father, who lives in Falmouth, Maine, with his
wife, Paulette, and two other sons. ``He died without pain, doing
what he loved.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after the accident, a fine snow fell on Waterville
Valley, blanketing the town's Victorian gables, frosting the pines.
To kids in the Waterville Valley Academy who spend mornings in
class and hit the slopes for afternoon practice, this would have
been an upbeat time _ finally, snow in this winter of drought.
</P>
<P>
   But there were no customary snowball fights. In fact, few of the
teenagers were talking at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is,'' said Colonel Pickering, the assistant headmaster of
the 60-student academy, ``the lowest point in the life of our
school.''
</P>
<P>
   Portrait of a friend
</P>
<P>
   In his office at the base of Snow's Mountain in the village of
Waterville Valley, Pickering was at his desk early on this morning,
answering telephone calls, many from concerned parents who had
heard the news. But Pickering also took time to deal with kids
coming through his door. Some didn't say a word and just gave him a
hug. A few shed tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them are still kind of stunned,'' Pickering said.
``Some of them don't really know what to think.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardillo was 5 feet 9 inches tall, weighed 150 pounds, and could
bench press 250 pounds. He had ski talents well beyond his years _
``fast feet,'' say his friends and coaches at Waterville Valley,
where he spent about five months a year away from his hometown in
Falmouth, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from ski racing, his favorite sport was soccer. His other
passion was tuna fishing with his uncle in the Gulf of Maine. His
sports hero was Austrian ski great Hermann Meier, frozen in an
action shot on a poster over the boy's bed at home.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, he seemed older, mature.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a way of making you laugh _ always,'' said Mike
Fairbrother, 13, of his roommate. ``You could just never feel bad
when he was around. He just always made everybody feel better. He'd
just start telling you a story like the one about how he caught a
bass when he was fishing in a derby, and kept feeding it to get it
fat so he could win. Those kinds of stories. He made you laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   To Anne Barbeau, wife of Waterville Valley headmaster Tom
Barbeau and housemother to Cardillo and two other students, a
playful day in the snow around Christmas best illustrated the young
man's personality. As he rolled a big snowball around the yard with
the other kids, including the Barbeaus' 6-year-old son, the ball
eventually got too big to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him out the window struggling with his shoulder against
that snowball, telling the others, `Come on, we can do it,' '' said
Anne, who also is a teacher at Waterville. ``And finally they had
this huge 7 1/2-foot snowman built in the back yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether he was talking about a pancake-eating contest (``He had
a tremendous appetite,'' Anne said) or about how he was sure he
would go bald like his father and uncles, Cardillo ``always had
something funny to talk about, and he could always find something
good in everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers and coaches described him as goal-oriented, an athlete
who aspired to race on the World Cup circuit. In the summer, Ken
Cardillo said Dan mowed lawns and worked on fishing boats out of
Falmouth. Cardillo said one reason Dan idolized Maier was that the
Austrian champion, once cut from the team, worked as a bricklayer
as he slowly turned himself into one of the sport's greatest
skiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny liked that, and he liked that hard physical work,''
Cardillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan also was impressed with Maier's seeming imperviousness to
pain, as witnessed in last year's Olympics when the Austrian walked
away from a spectacular crash in the downhill. But when Dan once
boasted to Tom Barbeau that he never got hurt when he skied,
Barbeau remembered telling him: ``Don't you ever say that. Even
kidding.''
</P>
<P>
   He touched so many
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, nearly 1,500 people crowded into the Cathedral of
the Immaculate Conception in Portland, Maine, to attend Dan
Cardillo's funeral, and the only question afterward was how, at age
14, he had touched so many lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that there was just some kind of special quality that
touched people,'' Ken Cardillo said. ``It was his passion. He was
passionate about everything he did, and that infected people who
knew him.''
</P>
<P>
   Waterville Academy felt a collective loss. After a memorial
meeting on Mount Tecumseh in which the entire school took a run
down the mountain in his honor, the student body was bused to the
funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime family friend Dan Pellegrin noted that the lyrics in
the Elton John song at the funeral was hauntingly appropriate:
``Daniel, my brother, you are older than me.''

   ``That's the way everyone felt about him,'' Pellegrin said.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of the accident, the Cardillos rented a plane to
fly to Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when we were flying over the White Mountains,
feeling very close to Dan,'' Ken said. ``I wasn't a ski racer, but
I watched Dan enough to know the kind of sensation he loved, and as
that small plane banked and rocked, I knew those were the same
sensations. Looking out at those mountains I felt like I was in
touch with him.''

DAYTONA BEGINNING TO HEAT UP

   ``Gentlemen, start your engines!''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen NASCAR Winston Cup drivers will kick off SpeedWeeks '99
when they heed that famous command and flip the ignition switches
of their 3,500-pound stock cars for Sunday's Bud Shootout at
Daytona International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-lap dash for cash among the 1998 Busch Pole Award winners
_ vying for a total purse of $512,500, with about $108,000
earmarked for the winner _ will serve as a primer for next Sunday's
big race, the Daytona 500, the inaugural event of NASCAR's 51st
season, a grueling campaign that has been expanded to 34 races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows you've got to drive hard and you have to take
some chances,'' said Rusty Wallace, winner of last year's Shootout
who got the pole position in a random drawing Thursday. ``Track
position in NASCAR Winston Cup racing is real important, and
anytime you can start up front it has got to be good.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon, the three-time Winston Cup champion, earned the
right to start up front next Sunday after qualifying fastest
Saturday in 195.067 miles per hour. Gordon put surprising rookie
Tony Stewart on the outside pole, bettering Stewart's lap of
194.599.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the 43-car field will be determined this week.
Thursday's Twin 125s will set positions 3 through 30. The next six
spots will go to the fastest remaining drivers from the three days
of time trials leading up to the Twin 125s. The remaining seven
spots will be filled with provisional starters who finished in the
Top 40 on last year's points list.
</P>
<P>
   The Bud Shootout field consists of 14 Busch Pole winners and a
15th driver, the winner of a 25-lap qualifying race. Geoff Bodine,
who will pilot a car fielded by Joe Bessey, a Busch Grand National
driver from Scarborough, Maine, drew the pole position for the Bud
Shootout Qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, meanwhile, hopes his No. 2 Miller Lite Ford Taurus will
be every bit as fast in the Shootout as it was during preseason
testing at Daytona, when he posted a fast lap of 193.129 miles per
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was second-fastest during testing in his Chevrolet Monte
Carlo (192.452) with Kyle Petty third in his Pontiac Grand Prix
(192.341).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not predicting more success, but I'll be the first to tell
you that it sure feels good,'' said Wallace, whose fifth-place
finish in last year's Daytona 500 represented his best result this
decade in NASCAR's crown jewel. ``From what all we've experienced
at Daytona down through the years'' _ he has crashed four times in
the last eight races _ ``to have the good runs and good finishes
like we have had is almost a payback. We've had all kinds of weird
stuff happen and sometimes it got pretty wild and ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Gordon, ``It's a whole different ballgame when you get to
Daytona for SpeedWeeks. As history has shown, the fastest qualifier
is not always the one who wins. Handling is very important at
Daytona.''
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Craven, the native of Newburgh, Maine, who last year
parted ways with Hendrick Motorsports, will be in Sunday's Bud
Shootout, behind the wheel of the No. 58 Hollywood Video Ford
Taurus fielded by SB III Motorsports. Craven earned his spot by
winning the pole position in last year's Jiffy Lube 300 at New
Hampshire International Speedway, his first race back after an
extended recuperation from postconcussion syndrome. ``This is
almost like a dress rehearsal for the Daytona 500,'' Craven said.
``The team has literally put in hundreds of hours preparing for
this. I know we are ready. Hollywood Video has signed on for the
big event, but now it's up to us to make sure there's a sequel.'' .
. . Eddie Cheever, winner of the 1998 Indianapolis 500, won the
Indy Racing League opener in Orlando Jan. 24 for the second year in
a row. Last year, Stewart's blown engine vaulted Cheever into the
lead. Minutes later, a downpour forced the stoppage and eventual
cancellation of the race. Cheever was declared the winner without
having led a single green-flag lap. This year, however, Cheever
said he ``had the best team and the best car'' at the end of the
race. He led the final seven laps ahead of runner-up Scott Goodyear
and third-place finisher Jeff Ward . . . Stewart, who left John
Menard's IRL team to embark on a Winston Cup career with Joe Gibbs
Racing, showed up in Orlando as part-owner of an Aurora-powered
Dallara driven by Brazilian Gualter Salles. Stewart teamed up with
Andy Card, and Larry Curry, Team Menard's former manager. Stewart
is contracted with Gibbs to race the full Winston Cup schedule but
will be allowed to drive in the Indy 500 . . . Menard, the
loquacious car owner who was the last to win an IRL race at NHIS,
has pared down his team to a one-car outfit headed by driver Greg
Ray and manager Thomas Knapp. He also has spread his wings to the
FedEx CART Series as a part-owner of Team Gordon, an outfit
co-owned by driver Robby Gordon and Mike Held.

NEW LOCKOUT DEAL SUITS PITINO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He looks around at his team now and there's a sigh of relief. No
one has to tell Rick Pitino that it easily could have looked quite
different. The old rules were stifling his rebuilding program and
he could only hope for salvation from a new set of rules.
</P>
<P>
   He got it in the form of the new collective bargaining
agreement. And now, with the NBA season two days old, he paused to
look back and talk about how easily all of his efforts could have
come undone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (past) summer, I didn't think there was any way (to
retain the key players),'' he said. ``We looked into all scenarios
and never could get any value for a trade, primarily because the
(other) team said, `We'd be in the same boat as you are, so how can
we sign him?' ''
</P>
<P>
   His owner had said Boston would not follow the salary madness.
Paul Gaston simply said ``no'' to spiraling salaries, and while
that was fiscally sound, it also might have led to the team being
dismantled before it ever had a chance to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way Paul Gaston wants to run the Boston Celtics _ fiscally
_ we could not, under the old rules, do it,'' Pitino said. ``If the
salaries go that high, the Celtics had no chance of making money.
The Knicks last year made $40 million because of Cablevision. We
made $12 million. That's great. But if we do the same things they
do, we'd lose $12 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Was Pitino disappointed that economics was threatening to
unravel everything he was building? He most definitely was.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look back, and one of the biggest things for me as a coach
was having those two draft picks, thinking we might get (Tim)
Duncan and (Keith) Van Horn,'' said Pitino. ``That was an enticing
way to rebuild. Then, when you have your best player (Antoine
Walker) and you might lose him, there are certain handcuffs that
you can't open up.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I never look back and say, `I'm sorry I left.' The Boston
Celtics is one of the best jobs in all of basketball at the
professional level. It gives you what Kentucky gave you at the
collegiate level. I never regretted that. But I wondered how I was
going to build this team.''
</P>
<P>
   The club has taken care of Walker and will get a similar bill
this summer for Ron Mercer's future services. They'll have to start
paying Kenny Anderson's salary as well. Does Pitino feel ownership
will continue to pay out the large sums, even if they are scaled,
to retain their top players?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way we work: He gives me the budget, which is the
salary cap,'' Pitino said. ``Then you have your exceptions above
that. He wants me to stay within that salary cap. Basically, he
lets me do my own thing. `Here's your budget; stay within it.' He
believes in the salary cap. He believes that's what everybody
should live by.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino says his budget projections for the next five years
indicate he is ``close to staying within the framework that Paul
wants.'' Presumably, that does not include contract extensions for
Greg Minor or Pervis Ellison. But it does mean that the eventual
deal produced by all of those days and nights of labor
sabre-rattling were an unadulterated blessing for Pitino and his
team.
</P>

The stolen Nugget
</P>
<P>
   NBC, the former official network of the world-champion Chicago
Bulls, has its cameras Sunday in New York (Miami-Knicks), Detroit
(Indiana-Pistons), and Los Angeles (Utah-Lakers). But the most
interesting game on the docket may be in Phoenix, where the Suns
play host to the Nuggets and ex-Sun Antonio McDyess makes his first
appearance since the bizarre tale that led him to leave for the
Rockies. Suns boss Jerry Colangelo still can't get over it. ``It
was bizarre, beyond comprehension, not even believable,'' Colangelo
said. McDyess turned down more money to sign with Denver, then had
second thoughts at the altar. Some Suns (Jason Kidd, Rex Chapman,
and Danny Manning, according to Colangelo) actually flew to Denver
for one final recruiting pitch. But, Colangelo said, ``They never
got to see him. He had called our players and they thought he
sounded distraught. They were concerned about his well-being. But
when they got there, they didn't see him. They hid him.'' McDyess
signed with the Nuggets the next day. Colangelo said he had a
feeling during the lockout that McDyess was going to slip away.
``The way it played out was a joke, an absolute joke,'' he said. He
inferred that there may even have been some, er, shenanigans going
on with McDyess working out in Houston and some people who looked a
lot like Denver employees close by. ``I've got a lot of stuff,'' he
said. ``What am I going to do with it? Probably nothing. But I have
a very long memory.'' . . . Seven referees who worked last season
will not be working this season. Ed Middleton and Billy Oakes, two
veterans, have retired. Woody Mayfield (knee) and Jo Borgia (back)
had to prematurely retire because of injuries, and Monty
McCutcheon, who was expected back, ruptured an Achilles' tendon
while jogging and is out for the year. Blane Reichelt and Ron
Olesiak have IRS situations and likely will miss six months before
being reinstated . . . Toughest start of this ridiculous season has
to go to the Atlanta Hawks. They broke from the blocks playing
Friday night, Saturday night, and Sunday night. Miami, meanwhile,
has a three-in-three stretch this Sunday afternoon in New York,
Monday night in Charlotte, and Tuesday night in Miami against the
Celtics. One might think the young, frisky Celtics would have a big
edge there, but Boston will be playing its second game in as many
nights and fourth in five days. Meanwhile, three teams opened
Saturday night and two, Portland and Vancouver, do not play their
first game until Sunday night . . . Some of the old-timers are
chuckling over all the wailing about games on consecutive nights.
Rod Thorn, the NBA's director of operations, recalled one season
with Detroit in which the Pistons played on five consecutive nights
in five cities. ``And we won the last one, too, which was against
the Lakers in Pittsburgh. Dick Barnett missed a wide-open jumper at
the buzzer,'' he said. ``Those were the days when men were men,''
he added with a laugh. ``But seriously, you didn't even think about
it. You just did it. That's the way it was.'' . . . Several coaches
were asked if they'd like to have Dennis Rodman on their team. The
Lakers' Del Harris noted that Shaq has endorsed such a move,
adding, ``I wouldn't go against my big fellow.'' He didn't say much
more. New York's Jeff Van Gundy added, ``Do I think he's a very
good player? Absolutely. Do I think he can help a team? Without a
doubt. As of now, I don't think I'm going to worry about that.''
Miami's Pat Riley said he'd had no personal contact with Rodman (in
other words, expect a deal soon), and Sacramento's Rick Adelman
said he'd worry about Rodman's impact on his young players. But the
ever-iconoclastic George Karl of Milwaukee offered this: ``I
personally would like to have him, and I personally had that
conversation with our organization. (Bet Herb Kohl loved hearing
that.) At this time, I think Dennis is more inclined to go to a
contender or a sunshine team, but you never know. In a couple
weeks, he might give us a call. And I would say if he did do that,
I would be fairly optimistic we could talk our people into doing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics get their first look at Ike Austin in Orlando blue
Monday night. Already, the big guy is looking like some old Russian
cooking the history books. He told Miami writers that he never
wanted to leave, which is not what he was saying last year when he
knew the Heat couldn't re-sign him. Riley didn't buy that at all.
``Ike wasn't a mistake,'' he said. ``The mistake was (Brent) Barry.
Period. We basically traded for a guy who, when he got here, didn't
want to be here. That was the mistake.'' Riley said Austin twice
told him last season that he didn't want to be back and insists now
he would never have traded the big guy if he heard anything to the
contrary. As for his new digs, Austin said he thinks the Magic are
a division sleeper. He added that Penny Hardaway, who romanced him
heavily, is better suited for the shooting guard position than the
point. ``For the simple fact that he can do more, score more, and
really focus on his game,'' Austin said. ``At the point, he's got
to run the whole team, and he's got to make sure everyone's in
place, so he's more effective at (shooting guard).'' This comes as
news to Magic coach Chuck Daly, who has Hardaway at the point.
``He's going to play a significant amount of (point guard),'' Daly
said. ``We don't have any (other) point guards.'' . . . Sports
Illustrated profiled a handful of players it feels the NBA should
market to rebuild its image in the post-Jordan era. One was
Milwaukee guard Ray Allen, who is both good and a good guy. ``Ray
is scary at times,'' Karl said. ``I've actually sat there and
watched him play, and he is almost pretty he's so fluid and quick.
A combination of being all those things and a basketball player is
very unusual.'' Allen still hasn't signed an extension _ he has
until mid-March _ and would be a most attractive free agent this
summer. (Chicago may be salivating.) ``I'd be surprised if we
didn't get that done very soon,'' Karl said. ``I know there have
been discussions in that area. Ray is building a house here, so
everything is (moving) in the direction that will get it done very
quickly.'' . . . The Spurs have added perimeter shooting in Steve
Kerr and toughness in Mario Elie, but by far the biggest plus for
them is the return to form of Sean Elliott. The gifted small
forward has basically been missing in action the last two seasons
with injuries. But San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said this past
week that Elliott has his quick first step back and ``can jump like
he used to jump. Without those skills, Sean is really limited. He's
gone through every practice, through two-a-days, gone through the
whole preseason, and had no pain or swelling. He really is an
X-factor for us. If Sean could come back, it would be like getting
another draft pick. But since coaches always like to worry about
something, now we're just anxious to see how long that will last,
and if his knees hold up.'' . . . New Seattle coach Paul Westphal
isn't expecting much from his first-round pick, Vladimir Stepania.
But, Westy notes, the 7-footer looks a lot like Alvan Adams, one of
his former Phoenix teammates. That may be where the similarity
ends, at least for now.``Right now, he's pretty lost,'' Westphal
said. ``He's a skilled center, a high-post center. But he's totally
and understandably lost concerning NBA rules and defenses. He
doesn't understand what a foul is, or why he can push someone and
get called and not have it happen to someone else. He has a lot of
good fundamentals, but he needs to learn NBA mores. He has to learn
what the league is all about.''

UCONN TOO QUICK FOR STANFORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD _ The gates opened an hour before tipoff and Stanford's
students rushed to the courtside seats. Once there, they quickly
turned their wrath on Connecticut's pudgy point guard, Khalid
El-Amin. They chanted ``Fat Boy,'' they screamed a few obscenities,
and they held a placard that said: ``Khalid, One Word: Slimfast.''
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin smiled at the silliness, then spent the afternoon
helping Connecticut script a two-word response: ``Too Fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether this intersectional matchup is played in Storrs, Conn.,
or Stanford, whether it starts at 9 a.m. or noon, whether the
Huskies have All-American Richard Hamilton or not _ Saturday, they
did not _ the one constant is Connecticut's speed.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies were too fast for Stanford in a 20-point victory
last year, and they were too fast again Saturday _ handing the
Cardinal a rare homecourt loss 70-59 before 7,391 at frenzied
Maples.
</P>
<P>
   ``They forced us out of our game,'' said Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery, whose team shot 35 percent from the field. ``It's very
difficult to simulate how quick they are in practice. We weren't
able to get in the flow.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal thrives on brute strength, flawless fundamentals
and precise execution of its half-court offense. But against
well-coached teams that are also improbably fast _ i.e.:
Connecticut and Arizona _ Stanford has no counterpunch.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder it's 0-5 against those teams in the last 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our game plan was to make it fast, make it quick, make it our
game,'' Huskies coach Jim Calhoun said.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin made sure of it.
</P>
<P>
   Without Hamilton, he became Connecticut's first option. Using
his 5-foot-10, 203-pound frame to overpower Stanford's guards, he
took 38 percent of UConn's shots and finished with 23 points, five
assists and five steals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pretty much took us apart,'' Montgomery said.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin did most of his damage in the first half, scoring 16
points as the Huskies built an 18-point lead. The Cardinal rallied
late in the half and was within a basket several times in the
second. But it never took the lead, never settled into its comfort
zone. Stanford also missed 12 of 24 free throws and _ after failing
to convert on three crucial possessions in the final minutes _
watched an emotional El-Amin celebrate the Hamilton-less victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't show much class with the things they were yelling
at me,'' El-Amin said. ``Not `fat boy,' you expect that. But
`deadbeat dad.' That's not true. I take care of my kids. (He is
married and has two children.) That got inside my head. I didn't
appreciate that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a crippling loss for Stanford's push for a No.1 seed in
the NCAA Tournament. The Cardinal is the best in the Pac-10, but
with losses to Maryland and Connecticut it may not have the
credentials for a No.1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost to a lot of really good teams, and we haven't
beaten enough of them,'' Stanford center Tim Young said. ``If
you're talking big picture, maybe it doesn't look so good.''
</P>
<P>
   The small picture is a bit murky, as well. The Cardinal lost at
Arizona last weekend, then struggled to beat Cal on Wednesday in a
sloppy, grinding game. Stanford had hoped for a breakout
performance Saturday. Instead, it got a reminder of the need for
speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's discouraging because this was a great opportunity for
us,'' Montgomery said. ``But UConn deserved to win, based on how
hard they played and how efficient they played. We couldn't get
into our offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal gets another chance Thursday against UCLA.

KING HAPPY TO BE OUT OF TROUBLESOME CORNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a stunned Mike Tyson stood in a Rockville, Md., courtroom
Friday and found himself sentenced to a year in jail on what he
thought were two minor assault charges, Don King was not at his
side. No one was happier about that than the sport's leading
purveyor of bombast.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, many have held King responsible for Tyson's many
follies and foibles. Even today, as the former associates in
Palookaville sue each other, King is being blamed by some for Tyson
owing the Internal Revenue Service $14 million in back taxes, as if
Tyson somehow had no idea that a guy making $20 million a fight
owed the government a pound of flesh.
</P>
<P>
   But with King out of the picture for more than a year now, not
even his harshest critics could say that he had led Tyson into
handcuffs this time, just as no one could blame King for the harsh
and often profane words that came out of the former heavyweight
champion's mouth in the days leading up to his return to the ring
last month against Francois Botha.
</P>
<P>
   Those words and Tyson's admission that he had tried to break
Botha's arm during a clinch at the end of the first round of his
first fight since serving more than a year's suspension for twice
biting Evander Holyfield came back to haunt him, but no one could
blame King for that, either, a point reinforced last week by a most
unlikely King defender.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, when it all comes down, a person is gonna say
what he's gonna say,'' Holyfield said of Tyson. ``A person really
can't change his stripes. If you're a zebra, you're a zebra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I said (about the biting incident and that it
should be forgiven by the Nevada State Athletic Commission) I said
from the heart. If you don't forgive, you aren't the person you say
you are. If you give someone a chance and they hang themselves,
it's on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he don't have Don King to blame. His conduct has always
been what it was. It shows you somebody did a great job controlling
him before because a lot of these things didn't get out. Now he's
got no control and things are getting out.''
</P>
<P>
   So there you have it. What Tyson does, Holyfield insisted, is on
Tyson now, which frankly comes as a relief to his former promoter.
With Tyson facing either a year in jail and the possible end of his
boxing career or an appeal that could lead him to a three- to
seven-year sentence and a certain end to his career, King is not
worried about lawyers or bail money this time.
</P>
<P>
   That is now somebody else's problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Tyson was saying (about wishing he'd bitten Holyfield in
the throat and elsewhere, for example) is normal,'' King said.
``Now you know what I was going through. This is a rough guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You gotta work months with that guy to prepare him. Then you
still gotta choke him and say, `Whoa! Hold back!' Shelly Finkel
(Tyson's new manager) is not protecting his investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Finkel is or isn't is a story for another day. The story
for King these days is not Tyson, at least not until they meet in
court _ if they ever do. For the King of Bombast, the story is
Holyfield now, the man who defeated Tyson and became King's
brightest jewel.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most of King's life, his story is a quiet one, a
controlled story, a story he likes to tell these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is such a relief,'' King said of promoting Holyfield, who
will fight Lennox Lewis March 13 in a unification title bout that
has sold out Madison Square Garden and is expected to be one of the
all-time highest-grossing pay-per-view fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you say, `Be at the DuPont Plaza at 9 a.m. on Saturday,'
and then go to sleep, he's at the DuPont Plaza at 9. What a relief
this is for me. This is order like I've never known. I only lived
chaos all my life. What Holyfield has done is of redeeming
spiritual value for boxing. It's fun again.
</P>

   ``Mr. Clean brings order and respect into the boxing realm. We
got a new boxing atmosphere where you can enjoy the air. Holyfield
is bringing principles back to the sport. I don't want to talk
about nobody else but my champion. Praise the Lord! Evander is
coming! I've made the great leap of faith! He shocked and amazed
the world when he beat Tyson like David beat Goliath. Certainly it
did me. But I am converted!''
</P>
<P>
   As King roared, Holyfield laughed, a wide smile on his face. But
it was a smile of bemusement more than amusement, for he well knows
what Tyson apparently never did _ that Don King may be your
promoter, but he works for himself.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of most promoters. That does not mean they
don't at times greatly aid their fighters, as King sometimes did
for Tyson. The fact is, in the red light district of sports, it's
every man for himself.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows that better than King, the ultimate survivor in a
sport for whom survival is the bottom line. It is with Holyfield's
help that King has done that once again, when just a year ago many
believed he was finished for the 100th time because he was battling
a federal indictment and watching many of his fighters flee to
other promoters.
</P>
<P>
   They all, including Tyson, struck at the King, yet today King is
within a month of promoting the most talked-about fight since
Holyfield fought Tyson under King's promotional direction.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a difference this time for King _ he doesn't have
to babysit his fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working with Holyfield is truly a refreshing breeze,'' said
King. ``You're not reading about him in the tabloids. You're not
asking about law and order. Holyfield has taken the chaos out of
boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the Playboy interview. That's the real Tyson. I kind
of knew it was nuts all along, but where else could I go? You were
there. You had a cash cow. I tried to make him understand the
wayward ways don't work, but a guy from the ghetto outwitted guys
with PhDs, LLDs, and MDs. You gotta give Tyson credit. He's cunning
and shrewd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ain't that he don't know the difference between good and
bad. He knows. That's why, in the end, I really think they're going
to have to give me credit, because he won't let them do otherwise.
They won't have to lionize me. They'll just have to tell the truth.
I know I made a difference. Look at what's going on. You heard it
from Holyfield's lips.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. And from Tyson's.
</P>

   Holyfield was trying to relax the day before the Super Bowl
knowing his beloved Atlanta Falcons were the underdogs against the
Denver Broncos. Holyfield understood what that meant, having been
in the same position for most of his professional career. The
difference is that Holyfield has generally proved his doubters
wrong while his poor Falcons never got off the ground against the
Broncos. Some might view that as a bad omen, but Holyfield doesn't
believe in omens. He believes in God and himself, feeling that if
he works hard for the one, the other will deliver. His next
opportunity to prove that comes when he tries to unify the
heavyweight title for the first time since he lost it to Riddick
Bowe in 1992. That he is confident was clear from the minute
someone mentioned to him that Lewis went into training for the
fight in the Poconos last week. ``Last week?'' Holyfield said.
``Too late. It's not about who Lennox Lewis fought because we know
on any given night a guy who's been fighting as long as Lennox has
has ability. I haven't seen him do the things I've done, but we'll
all know if he can on that night. If I felt he wasn't no challenge,
I wouldn't fight him. But I don't train for nobody. I train for me.
I concentrate on me being the best. I think about how I could beat
me and figure if I can find a way I'm sure they'll be trying.
Problem is, if a guy don't try to exploit my weaknesses he's in
trouble. But if a guy do try to exploit my weaknesses, he's in
trouble, too. So either way, Lennox is in trouble.'' . . . In case
you tucked yourself in early to get rested up for the Super Bowl,
Michael Grant continued his march through the hinterlands of the
heavyweight division last Saturday night, stopping former sparring
partner Ahmad Adbin (25-2-3, 11 KOs) in the 10th round. Grant
(29-0, 26 KOs) dropped Abdin in the ninth and several times in the
10th before referee Eddie Cotton stopped the bout on the advice of
ringside physicians . . . The third annual Everlast women's
national amateur championships will be held April 20-24 in
Scranton, Pa. Fourteen titles will be at stake in junior and senior
divisions and the finals will be televised by ESPN on tape delay .
. . According to Bob Arum, Oscar De La Hoya will fight the winner
of the Frankie Randall-Oba Carr eliminator match in late spring and
then the winner of the Felix Trinidad-Pernell Whitaker fight in
conjunction with Mexican Independence Day, assuming, of course, De
La Hoya survives Ike Quartey next Saturday.

LET BUYERS BEWARE OF RYDER DEALS

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Ryder Cup at The Country Club in Brookline has created
intense interest, and it should be a great event for the area. But
a happening of this magnitude also creates a cottage industry, and
there seems to be no end to people trying to take advantage.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, sports is big business and the Ryder Cup probably
ranks just below the Olympics and the World Cup on the global
stage. Golf is hot. More important, golf is very hot with the
corporate world.
</P>
<P>
   It has been well-documented that Brookline residents who choose
to rent out their homes will command pretty good money. And that
area golf courses are being taken over for huge sums of cash for
various corporate entities and their pampered guests. But there is
another element lurking, that of the outside hospitality group. For
a while now, people _ most of them from the corporate world _ have
been solicited by telemarketers offering hospitality tent deals at
the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens to us at every event,'' said Mike Gilligan,
director of operations for the PGA of America. ``In a way, we are a
victim of our own success, because if we sell out, (the outside
hospitality groups) become that much stronger in the community.''
</P>
<P>
   People at The Country Club's Ryder Cup office have been fielding
calls from people confused about what these groups are selling. Two
of the more aggressive groups _ The Hospitality Group of America
Inc. and Pall Mall Corporate Hospitality Inc. _ sent out brochures
detailing lavish menus and daily itineraries complete with
champagne receptions and afternoon tea. There are two key points
worth noting about these brochures, however: The tents are not on
the The Country Club's grounds, and tickets to the Ryder Cup are
not included. A brochure from THG reads: ``Tickets are entirely
subject to availability and it is understood that The Hospitality
Group of America, Inc., has no ticketing arrangement with the PGA
or The Country Club.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard to believe, said Gilligan, but such a disclaimer doesn't
prevent some people from taking the chance.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA isn't alone in its concern about these groups. The US
Open, run by the US Golf Association, is also a favorite target. An
official with the USGA said he could not comment because of ongoing
litigation. A Bellevue, Wash., software company last fall filed
suit against THG over a tent deal at the PGA Championship at
Sahalee CC in Redmond, Wash. The case, said a spokesperson for
Pivotal Software USA Inc., was settled out of court, and under
terms of the agreement they could not comment.
</P>
<P>
   These outside hospitality groups have been noticed by player
agents. Part of THG's package boasts of possible pro-am pairings
with members of the PGA Tour. Bill Glasson is mentioned, but his
agent, David Parker, said, ``That is totally incorrect.'' Rich
Moroscak, who works for the company that represents Gene Sauers and
Brett Ogle, whose names are also mentioned, said he knew of no
plans for those players to be available for outings during the week
of the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Gilligan said there are many groups out there, ``some reputable,
some aren't. We still don't know how many will be out there or
where they will be located.'' A person answering the phone at Pall
Mall confirmed that it had plans to set up tents, but would not say
where. Ed Lawrence, owner of Allandale Farm, which is across the
street from The Country Club, said he has leased space to THG but
it is up to the company to secure the necessary permits. Calls to a
THG office in Chicago were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Sullivan, Brookline's deputy town administrator, said
requests for permits are coming in, but no permits have been issued
yet. He expressed concern that groups such as THG are in
competition with the PGA of America and The Country Club, but said,
``There's nothing we can do to prevent it if they meet all our
codes and rules. But we don't condone it.''
</P>
<P>
   John Cornish is general chair of the Ryder Cup Committee at The
Country Club and together with several members, he has been
involved in the planning since Day 1. He feels ``energized'' as the
event approaches after nearly six years of planning, but he
expressed concern about the outside groups, some of whom are
boasting of their abilities to secure tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know where the tickets are going,'' said Cornish. ``I don't
know where they are getting their tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   The ironic part, said Cornish, is that tables of 10 are still
available and the event is not sold out, as some outside groups
lead people to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Gilligan said it is possible that these outside hospitality
groups will come up with two tickets here, four there, ``but in big
blocks? Believe me, we have ultimate control of tickets, but we're
scratching our heads: Where are they going to get the tickets?''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, they don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I literally have had planners in tears in my office, asking,
`What do I do?' '' said Gilligan. ``I have heard too many stories,
a lot of scams.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Ianiro knows about that first-hand. He is a member at
Medinah CC in Chicago, site of the PGA Championship in August, and
in his role as hospitality sales chairman, he has an understanding
of how these outside groups work. In fact, Ianiro said, ``Several
times I have been solicited.''
</P>
<P>
   A logical target since he owns a brokerage firm, Ianiro told of
one call that months later still has him shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is calling me, trying to sell a tent to the PGA
Championship,'' said Ianiro, ``not knowing I was trying to sell
them, too, and at one point he says, `Nobody else knows this, but
Medinah is going to get a Ryder Cup.' I asked him how he knew that
and he said, `I have connections.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ianiro knew that Medinah was in the running for a Ryder Cup (the
club was eventually awarded the 2011 event), but he was curious
about what the caller said. So a few months later, when he found
the guy working at another outside hospitality group, Ianiro
couldn't help but ask about his supposed inside connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Oh, it was just part of the routine. I made lots of
cold calls. It wasn't good.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But the calls and solicitations will continue, said Ianiro,
because, ``They always have something to sell. You name it, they
are going to sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   He sympathizes with the unsuspecting people who get caught.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of companies are telling the PGA to spend some money to
get these groups off their backs, to get the public more aware,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad commentary,'' said Gilligan. ``But I can't
emphasize enough that it's a serious `buyer beware' situation.''
</P>

   The International in Bolton earned a victory of sorts last week
when a group that includes longtime general manager Brian Lynch
officially bought the course and adjacent land. Lynch, 38, began
caddying at The International in 1970 after being hired by head pro
Bill Ezinicki. You'd be hard-pressed to find two more loyal
gentlemen than Ezinicki and Lynch, so members should be happy that
things at the course will be pretty much status quo. Lynch is part
of a group _ Arklow LLP, headed by Dan Weadock _ that paid $25
million to Starwood Hotels and Resorts. Weadock retired from
Starwood last December and before that he was the president of ITT,
which owned The International before Starwood. Lynch said plans
will go forward on another 18-hole course on the 750-acre facility,
which also includes a nine-hole layout, Twin Springs . . . Speaking
of new courses, it is hard to believe that the course Jack Nicklaus
is building in Plymouth will be his first in Massachusetts. This is
a man who has 166 in use worldwide . . . More Nicklaus: He was
pampered by the staff at New England Baptist Hospital, he said, to
the point that they made the Golf Channel available. ``But I don't
need golf lessons right now,'' he quipped. The day before he was
released, Nicklaus watched the Phoenix Open and was intrigued by
Tiger Woods's request to have a boulder moved on the grounds that
it was a loose impediment. Nicklaus said he agreed with the ruling
and related it to a story from his design of Shoal Creek in
Alabama. In doing the 17th, a picturesque hole with a waterfall and
lake, Nicklaus was told that plenty of big rocks were available for
aesthetics. ``I said we'd like to get a couple of rocks, just a
little bigger than you can move.'' So heavy trucks came in and
massive rocks were strategically placed. ``They would not have been
ones Tiger could have moved,'' said Nicklaus . . . Ernie Els put up
another disappointing close last Sunday at the Heineken Classic in
Perth. In recent years he has been overtaken in the final round by
the likes of Steve Elkington, Vijay Singh, and Woods _ great
talents, so no embarrassment _ but someone named Jarrod Moseley
supplied the sting this time. Els led by six shots with 12 holes to
play, then began to unravel with a triple bogey. He finished with a
75, in a three-way tie for second. You can't help but wonder why he
struggles with these 54-hole leads.

PATRIOTS MAY HAVE TO REVERSE THEIR FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Regardless of whether Robert Edwards returns to full strength
before the 1999 season, the Patriots probably will have to shift
gears on their draft plans and take a running back somewhere in the
first two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards's knee injury is cause to realize that there isn't a
player on the roster that legitimately could fill the Georgia
rookie's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Patriots are looking over names such as Edgerrin
James of Miami, Cecil Collins of McNeese State, Sedrick (not
another Sedrick!) Irvin of Michigan State, James Johnson of
Mississipi State, and Kevin Faulk of LSU.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Ricky Williams; they have no shot.
</P>
<P>
   New England, which picks 21st and 28th in the first round,
should have been thinking of taking an offensive lineman, a
defensive lineman, or maybe a receiver with those choices.
</P>
<P>
   Now they may have to use one on another running back _ as
insurance, perhaps, or perhaps as someone who could be as effective
as Edwards. Edwards rushed for 1,115 yards as a rookie, the
15th-best total in the NFL. There were 20 running backs who gained
more than 1,000 yards, from Terrell Davis's 2,008 to Priest
Holmes's 1,008.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have put backup running back Sedrick Shaw on the
expansion draft list, which tells you how impressed they are with
him. Also on the roster are Derrick Cullors and Harold Shaw,
neither of whom instill much confidence in Patriot Nation.
</P>
<P>
   Free agency doesn't offer many options, either.
</P>
<P>
   Karim Abdul-Jabbar is a restricted free agent but the Dolphins
will likely re-sign him to a long-term deal. The Patriots could
pull a Curtis Martin in reverse and offer Jabbar a huge contract
and hope the Dolphins don't match it. That would cost them a first-
and a third-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   Unrestricted free agents available include Errict Rhett, Ray
Zellars, Eric Bieniemy, Tyrone Hughes, Sherman Williams, Vaughn
Hebron, Darick Holmes, William Henderson, Keith Elias, Zack
Crockett, Corey Fuller, David Palmer, Aaron Craver, Dave Meggett,
Randy Jordan, Tim Lester, Fred McAfee, Jerry Ellison, and Leshai
Maston.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a stud in that group would be like striking oil in your
backyard.
</P>
<P>
   The time that the Patriots hoped to devote to Edwards's
development this year _ working on things such as strength, speed,
and better open-field running _ now will go toward rehabilitation.
This is a serious setback, one the Patriots certainly didn't need
after a season in which injuries spoiled their chance to move
deeper into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Chris Palmer has been getting his feet wet as the new head coach
of the Cleveland Browns, but on Tuesday, he'll begin to make his
mark when the expansion draft is held in Canton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer knows he is unlikely to get a star player, though these
selections may have more immediate impact than those from 1995,
when Jacksonville and Carolina were stocking. One hundred and fifty
players are available, and the Browns will chose 32. Palmer
realizes that about half of them will be at the bottom of his
roster.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer had been an assistant with the Jaguars, but not as far
back as '95, when they went through their expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly have a great situation where we're coming into
the league by ourselves and we have the pick of the litter,'' said
Palmer. ``There are some very good players who will be available to
us. We just have to be smart in the players we chose and the
players that the teams pull back. That's the toughest part of the
game, seeing which players the teams pull back once we take one of
their guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, who also was a Patriots assistant, may feel comfortable
selecting Jacksonville and New England players. He coached Vincent
Brisby, one of the more attractive receivers on the expansion list.
He's also familiar with Todd Rucci and Ferric Collons. The Patriots
may leave all three exposed throughout the draft in hopes that the
Browns will take on their big salaries. Also on the Patriots' list
is Shaw and 6-foot-8-inch, 335-pound guard Scott Rehberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Familiarity with players can work both ways,'' said Palmer.
``If you've coached them, you know what they can do and you
certainly know what they can't do. Sometimes you don't want to
coach a particular player again.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer says he hasn't formulated a philosophy for building his
team, whether it be the Jacksonville way with younger players, or
the Carolina way with older ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really follow someone else's blueprint, because the
circumstances are always different with the players available to
you,'' said Palmer. ``We have to do a great job in the college
draft, the expansion draft, and in the free agent market. That much
we know.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in the week he was trying to fill three coaching spot _
linebackers, special teams, and receivers. He had all but given up
on the idea of having an offensive coordinator after Denver
receivers coach Mike Heimerdinger declined to interview. For now,
Palmer will double as head coach and offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Offense is what Palmer knows best. And in an age when offense is
taking over as the biggest aspect of the game, Palmer seems
prepared to piece together a strong one.
</P>
<P>
   ``This situation is really not unlike what we had with the
Patriots when we were 1-15 and then we had the No. 1 pick in the
draft,'' he said. ``We took Drew Bledsoe and the franchise began to
turn things around for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   As one who has had a hand in developing Bledsoe and Mark
Brunell, Palmer seems to favor quarterbacks, which is why the
speculation is overwhelming that Cleveland will take Kentucky's Tim
Couch with the first selection in April's college draft.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked about it, Palmer laughed and said, ``You know, we
aren't even anywhere close to talking about that. The coaching
staff has taken up most of my time.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Palmer knows that the first selection in the college
draft is one of those monumental picks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that long ago that we debated Rick Mirer or Drew
Bledsoe,'' said Palmer. ``After their first year, some thought
Mirer had the better rookie season. Obviously Drew has had the
better career, but it's really a situation where you need a crystal
ball. You have to go with the player your organization feels
strongest about and hope you've made the right pick.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't bet against Palmer making a run at Tom Tupa if the
Patriots haven't re-signed their punter/backup quarterback Friday,
when free agency begins. Palmer was close to Tupa in New England,
and Tupa is a Cleveland native.

   This week's local-boy-makes-good story is Mark Banker, a former
football standout at Plymouth-Carver High School, Class of 1974.
Banker had been on Mike Riley's staff as a secondary coach and
recruiter at Oregon State and was one of three coaches Riley was
able to hire when he was named the Chargers' head man. For a kid
who grew up in America's Hometown, Banker has now spent almost half
his life on the West Coast. After four years and graduate work at
Springfield College, Banker became defensive coordinator and
recruiter at Cal State-Northridge, which went from Division 2 to
Division 1-AA during his 14 years there. He also coached with Riley
at Southern Cal and spent almost two years at the University of
Hawaii before rejoining Riley at Oregon State. ``It's a dream come
true,'' said Banker. ``I've always wanted to end up in the NFL and
I'm fortunate to be with a great coach like Mike Riley. I know the
outside world thought it was surprising he got the job, but when
you've been around him and worked with him, you understand why.
He's a brilliant coach with great ideas. I know that Baltimore,
Chicago, and Carolina all wanted to talk to him about their job. He
has a great reputation in our business.'' . . . Kennard McGuire,
the agent for defensive tackle Mark Wheeler, doesn't believe the
Patriots want his client back . . . The Patriots will go back to
Bryant College for training camp, but only for the short term.
School officials and team brass are working out a new lease. The
Patriots may try to find a Boston site for camp within the next few
years . . . Miami's Jimmy Johnson passed on a chance to acquire
Carl Pickens last week. The Bengals have let the unrestricted free
agent receiver make his own deal with the understanding that
Pickens will have a franchise tag on him. Once he has the tag,
teams must give up a first- and a third-round pick to acquire him
and his $4 million-$5 million salary. Johnson passed. Pickens would
like to play for the Cowboys, who need another receiver to go along
with Michael Irvin . . . Jack Mula, Doug Flutie's agent, flew to
Buffalo Friday to begin contract negotiations. ``We'll find out
whether the Bills want Doug to finish his career in Buffalo,'' said
Mula . . . Williams, the Heisman Trophy winner, made the first big
mistake of his career when he dumped Boston's Woolf Associates as
his representative . . . Back to our favorite subject: offseason
conditioning programs. Before last season, the Chargers had their
best turnout and best program in years. The result: five wins. The
Vikings, who traditionally have a below-average turnout: 15 wins
and 1 point away from the Super Bowl. If you have good players and
they work out, you win a lot of games. Contrary to popular belief,
the Patriots were among the top teams in the league in turnout in
'98, with 46 players attending the program. Not all of them
completed the 40 workouts, but most did . . . Workout bonuses of
$50,000 or more have come into vogue the past three or four years.
Patriots with bonuses of $50,000 or more include: Bledsoe, Terry
Glenn, Rucci, Max Lane, Willie McGinest, Ted Johnson, Chris Slade,
Armstrong, Zefross Moss, Tony Carter, and Ben Coates. The other
players have the more standard $5,000-$7,000 bonus. Who among the
group with big bonuses was skipping out last winter? Only Bruce
Armstrong and Moss were absent for all the workouts, and the
Patriots say they don't worry about Armstrong because he's a
six-time Pro Bowler. Glenn made about 25 workouts. McGinest skipped
a few. Rucci, Lane, Slade, Johnson, Carter, and Coates were all
loyal to the program. Bledsoe made nearly all the workouts . . . It
doesn't look as though Meggett will be re-signed by the Jets, as
Bill Parcells wants Leon Johnson to be his kick returner . . .
Don't be surprised if Coates has his contract renegotiated before
the start of next season . . . Ty Law has been practicing catching
punts in Hawaii, though he won't do it in Sunday's Pro Bowl. Lawyer
Milloy on Law's desire to return punts: ``Over my dead body. Until
we get the right corner spot solid, Ty isn't doing any of that.
He's playing his position. We can't afford to get him hurt.''

   VAIL, Colo. _ Over one of the most dangerous downhill courses in
the world _ the Birds of Prey at Beaver Creek _ Hermann Maier,
Austria's all-world ski champion, muscled through the icy track at
80 miles an hour to win the downhill gold medal at the World Alpine
Championships here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Maier beat archrival Lasse Kjus from Norway by .31 of a second,
with another Norwegian champion, Kjetil Andre Aamodt, more than a
half-second back for the bronze medal.

<P>
   Maier, who electrified the world with his flying, 70-m.p.h.
crash in the Nagano Olympic downhill last year, approached this
race with his customary attitude: ``If you do not take risks, you
cannot win ski races.''
</P>
<P>
   Maier used his size and strength (6 feet 2 inches, 210 pounds)
and was aggressive. Through the difficult series of high-speed
turns and 150-foot jumps, Maier bashed his way between the gate
poles, keeping a line higher than the other racers. He threw his
weight from edge to edge wildly but stayed solid on his skis where
other racers were being tossed around on the icy bumps.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening competition of these championships last Tuesday,
the Super-G, Maier had tied Kjus for the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, waiting at the bottom for Kjus to make his run, Maier
said he was surprised that the Norwegian did not take over the lead
because his run seemd so strong.
</P>
<P>
   The US skiers did not fare well. Daron Rahlves, Casey Puckett,
and Chad Fleischer were victims of a sudden snow squall that
diminished visibility and slowed the track for the late racers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That snow changed the whole race,'' said Tom Kelly, spokesman
for the US Ski and Snowboarding team.
</P>
<P>
   Rahlves, 24, from Truckee, Calif., was thrown off his skis by a
series of bumps that he never saw. After his crash, he was able to
walk off but complained of soreness in one knee. Puckett also
crashed, lost a ski, but finished the race (in 34th place) on one
leg to the delight of a big crowd. Fleischer, a hometown skier from
Vail who is built like Maier, predicted in training that he would
win Saturday's race. But his 23d-place finish was 4.73 seconds off
Maier's winning pace.
</P>
<P>
   The rowdy gathering of 3,000 began picking up the chant from
Maier's fan club from the time the Austrian got into the starting
gate. The roar grew as they watched ``The Herminator'' punch
through turn after turn, courting disaster. When he swept into the
finish area after his trademark run, it was clear that the only
other skier who could beat his time was coming next, Kjus.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegian attacked the course with nearly the same ferocity
as Maier. Kjus stayed firm on his skis over the bumpy ice and made
the fallaway turns with precision, yet he fell back by a third of a
second that he never made up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if he was heavier it could have helped him today,'' said
Maier, who cavorted with his jubilant fans after the race, at one
point explaining that a chronically sore back had been soothed by a
new ``groundhog grease'' he was rubbing on it.
</P>
<P>
   Since joining the Austrian team in 1996, Maier has won 17 World
Cup races, an Olympic gold medal, and two golds so far at these
Worlds. After his spectacular crash last year (``Not Lufthansa, but
not bad,'' he joked), he was back in the Super-G race two days
later, with a sore back and several bruises, and won.

BC PICKED APART BY RUTGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston College women's basketball coach Cathy Inglese tried hard
to be optimistic Saturday when she looked at the stat sheet at
haltime and saw that her team was shooting 22 percent against
Rutgers, and was trailing, 37-20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I said the good news is we can't shoot any worse,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She was right. But even though the shooting got slightly better,
it wasn't enough. Rutgers, No. 12 nationally and No. 2 in the Big
East, improved its record to 20-4, 12-1 in the conference, as it
handed BC a 71-52 loss before 3,243 at Conte Forum. The No. 20
Eagles fell to 17-5 overall, 9-5 in the Big East.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers entered ranked second in the country in scoring defense,
having held its opponents to 55.6 points a game. The Knights, who
usually play a zone, switched to a man-to-man to confuse the
Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent the last two days practicing different kinds of zone
and man-to-man defenses, and I really wished we had picked one and
stuck with it,'' said Inglese. ``But I thought they played a
tremendous game and picked us apart.''
</P>
<P>
   That began as soon as the buzzer went off, when Rutgers'
6-foot-4-inch center, Tammy Sutton-Brown, opened with a field goal,
followed by three consecutive 3-pointers by 5-10 senior guard
Tomora Young. Only three minutes into the game, Rutgers had built
an 11-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Inglese called a timeout to get her team to wake up and regroup.
But the damage was only beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Even though point guard Brianne Stepherson _ one of three
freshmen starting for BC _ knocked in a 3-pointer, and the Eagles
made nine trips to the free-throw line to account for 7 points,
forward Alissa Murphy shot 1 for 7 in the first half, while guard
Nicole Conway was 1 for 6.
</P>
<P>
   And as cold as Eagles were, that's how hot the Knights were.
Paced by another 3-pointer by Young, and another by forward
Shawnetta Stewart, Rutgers kept adding to its lead to finish the
half with that 17-point bulge.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the worst we've shot all season, and Rutgers is a very
good defensive team,'' Inglese said.
</P>
<P>
   To open the second half, BC got a steal by Murphy, who was
fouled and made both free throws. That was followed by a jumper by
freshman forward Becky Gottstein, and the Eagles had closed the gap
to 13. But that was the closest they would come, as Rutgers passed
the ball around the perimeter to fire from the outside, and forced
BC into 21 turnovers. Gottstein scored a team-high 12 points,
followed by Whitney Steele's 11, and Murphy's 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was probably one of the finer games we've played,'' said
Rutgers coach C. Vivian Stringer. ``I was real pleased with our
defense, because we haven't played man-to-man in quite some time.
But everyone knew what their assignment was and held everyone
accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though BC outrebounded Rutgers, 36-35, the Knights shot 48
percent from the field and 41 percent from the 3-point line.
Sutton-Brown scored a game-high 18 points, followed by Young with
16. Tasha Pointer, a 5-6 guard, had 8 points and nine assists.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who gave credit for her four 3-pointers to Pointer among
others, also cited the new black-with-red-trim uniforms the team
broke out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great,'' she said. ``Made all the difference in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   And who can argue with that?

DETERMINED HUSKIES HURT STANFORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ UConn Saturday was facing a hostile crowd.
It was playing a Top 5 team and its best player was on the bench
with an injury. Two other starters were playing hurt, and in the
first half some questionable calls helped an 18-point lead shrink
to 4 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   All of this after one of its worst performances in a decade,
marked by poor play and, quite shockingly, lack of effort.
</P>
<P>
   Sounded pretty grim if you were UConn coach Jim Calhoun and your
No. 1 ranked (at least until Monday) Huskies had traveled to Maples
Pavilion to face No. 3 Stanford, a team with revenge on its mind
after getting spanked by the Huskies last season in Storrs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were people who didn't think we could win this game,''
said Calhoun with a smile after watching his team roll to a 70-59
victory. ``And considering how we played against Syracuse on Monday
night (a 59-42 loss), and with 20 points missing from the lineup
(with the absence of Richard Hamilton, suffering from a thigh
contusion), they might have had reason to feel that way. I never
thought it. And no one on this team thought it.''
</P>
<P>
   A sellout crowd of 7,391 that came to bury the Huskies, not
praise them, certainly didn't expect to see UConn win its 20th game
in 21 tries going away.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a win,'' said Calhoun with a smile, a laugh, and a
shake of his head. ``You're not going to see too many efforts
better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not under the circumstances, which brought the Huskies
into the Bay Area wondering not only how they would play, but who
they would play.
</P>
<P>
   The question marks were center Jake Voskuhl (bruised foot) and
Hamilton. After getting the OK from the doctors in midweek, Voskuhl
was fine and contributned down the stretch when the Huskies
withstood a final Cardinal surge.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton was a different matter. The thigh contusion was deep,
making him doubtful. He worked out briefly on Friday and gave it
another shot before the game, but decided not to play.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Monday night, when the Huskies learned Voskuhl and
Hamilton would not play a mere seven hours before tipoff, this time
they had plenty of time to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   Given time, few coaches do a better job of preparing a team than
Calhoun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought Rip (Hamilton) would be available and I don't
think he'll be ready against Boston Collge (on Wednesday),'' said
Calhoun. ``But now, for the first time, I believe we are deep.''
</P>
<P>
   He should. The Huskies trotted out all sorts of heroes. In the
first half, it was Khalid El-Amin, who scored 16 of his 23 points
as the Huskies jumped to an astounding 26-8 lead before the
Cardinal finally got back into it.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was guard Ricky Moore, who again came up with a monster
defensive performance and also scored 12 points, pulled down six
rebounds, and took over the game in the second half when the
Cardinal were matching the Huskies basket for basket.
</P>
<P>
   There was Voskuhl, limited to ony 20 minutes because of his
injury, but who blocked two shots and came up with a couple of key
rebounds in the final two minutes. There also was Kevin Freeman,
who made six of seven field goals and scored 14 points, picking up
the slack for Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thing about this team,'' said Voskuhl, who made his
biggest play when he tipped a ball to El-Amin, who then got the
ball to Freeman, who made a jump shot. That turned what had become
a 56-54 lead to 58-54 with 1:34 left. ``We have so many leaders who
can take over. It's what makes this team so good.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Stanford's not going to argue. The Cardinal (19-4)
never had a lead. ``They took us out early with their defense and
they forced us out of our game,'' said Cardinal coach Mike
Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the Big East officiating crew of Ted Valentine, John
Cahill, and Donnee Gray started to take center stage _ Valentine
gave Calhoun a T after he stepped across the line with his constant
haranguing, the game never really got away from the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them to do what they were doing,'' said Calhoun, ``I
told them to continue to play aggressively.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we did,'' said El-Amin, who took abuse from the
crowd all game. ``We came out here and took control of the game
from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies did that.

YOUNG, BARNES TRADE PLACES FOR UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two months ago, while UCLA guard Ray Young sat on
the bench wondering when his next chance would come, forward Matt
Barnes could do no wrong and had the playing time to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the freshmen have reversed roles. Young is playing heavy
minutes and producing while Barnes struggles, in one minute and out
the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like they've traded places,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin
said. ``At the start of the year, Matt was playing well and Ray
couldn't do anything right. They've flip-flopped.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last five games, Young has averaged 22 minutes, scored 37
points and played tenacious defense. Barnes, who lost conditioning
and confidence after spraining his ankle over Christmas, has
averaged 10 minutes and scored 12 points in that span.
</P>
<P>
   Last week at Washington State, Barnes had five points in nine
minutes in the first half, then did not play in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, against Oregon, he played two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really want to get Matt more minutes,'' Lavin said. ``I have
to put him in and let him play through his mistakes. He's had a
couple of good weeks of practice, and he's getting better. Being
yanked in and out probably has hurt his confidence to a certain
degree. . . . I'd like to have him, by (NCAA) Tournament time, in
the rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   Gadzuric update: Freshman center Dan Gadzuric played a
season-low eight minutes against Oregon (one minute in the second
half) because of matchup problems and nagging tendinitis in his
right knee.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins will monitor Gadzuric's minutes. He's lost
conditioning and a bit of confidence because he cannot practice
full-time on the tender knees.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin expects Gadzuric to play today and believes Oregon State
is a better matchup for both Gadzuric and power forward Jerome
Moiso. Whereas Oregon's big men are quick and capable of playing on
the perimeter, Oregon State's front-liners tend to remain in the
low post.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, our quick lineup always works better against
(the Ducks),'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   Up against the wall? UCLA played its worst defensive games of
the season against Washington and Oregon, which shot 54.5 and 51.9
percent from the field, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin attributes the trouble to two factors: fatigue and
fundamentals. The Bruins don't fight through screens well, they
gamble for passes, they do not hustle to stop fast breaks and they
yield position in the low post. Fatigue has compounded the
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it is when you're fatigued, you're not as alert,
you're not as quick in rotating, not as quick to long rebounds and
loose balls,'' he said. ``And part of it is we have got to continue
to get better in those areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The fatigue factor makes it difficult to correct the problems
using practice, he explained, so the Bruins are watching more
videotape than they have in recent seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more mental preparation,'' he said.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: THE POWER OF THE EDITED IMAGE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On video, Monica Lewinsky seemed neither the little lost lamb
nor the thong-snapping stalker of some people's imaginations. What
she  &UR; was &LR;  depended on who was choosing the video clips.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Seligman, one of the president's lawyers, played an
18-minute excerpt from Ms. Lewinsky's video deposition Saturday
afternoon. In that lengthy clip, Ms. Lewinsky sighed, she rubbed
her nose, she brushed back her hair, she sipped water from a straw.
Asked how she chose which gifts from the president to produce in
response to a subpoena, she answered, ``Kind of in an obnoxious
way, I guess.'' She offered nervous laughter. After a year of
seeing her mobbed by photographers, of hearing her disembodied
voice sobbing and scheming on the Linda Tripp tapes, we finally saw
her with a sympathetic human face.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Seligman offered the extended excerpt in response to the
flurry of snippets from the same tape played by the House
prosecutors through the morning. She accused them of sleazy
editing, and in fact their presentation had created a far sterner
image. Paring away all small gestures and bits of revealing body
language, they presented a Monica Lewinsky who was businesslike,
confident and surprising only in her familiarity. With her demure
pearls and discreet black suit, she was a woman in full command of
the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the inadvertent tribute to the powers of editing,
Saturday's video testimony offered a fresh phenomenon in the
president's trial: the boomeranging spin, with each side producing
the opposite impression from what they might have liked. For it was
the Republicans who had been howling about how ``young'' and
``vulnerable'' Ms. Lewinsky would seem on tape. And it was the
White House who, by letting the tape roll so Ms. Lewinsky could say
she never discussed affidavits with the president, displayed a
tenderly young woman who thought she had been having an exciting
affair and found herself swept up in a tidal wave of subpoenas and
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The advance billing for this video had always sounded desperate.
(You've seen her! You've heard her talk! But not at the very same
time!) And despite the different approaches, much of what the
public saw yesterday was familiar. In both presentations, Ms.
Lewinsky seemed coiffed and coached to the limits of human
endurance. Her poise was not surprising, given that she has played
the witness in this drama more than 20 times.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides weighed in with what Greta van Sustern, the CNN legal
analyst, had predicted would be ``dueling sound bites.'' And as the
spinning voices of House prosecutors and White House lawyers set up
the clips they wanted viewers to see, they created arguments but
not much of a narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Because the text of the deposition had been released the day
before, everyone knew there would be no slamdunk evidence to change
either side's case. What seemed most disappointing, then, was that
the most gripping moments from Ms. Lewinsky's deposition were not
played.
</P>
<P>
   In the deposition, Ms. Lewinsky mentions several events that
made her sob. She says, ``I was a pest,'' about arranging meetings
with Clinton. She often makes the distinction between ``the
president'' and ``the man.'' In a line quoted endlessly on
television, she says she has ``mixed feelings'' for the president
now. And she asks Rep. Ed Bryant, the Tennessee Republican who
questioned her, not to refer to her first sexual encounter with the
president as ``the first so-called salacious occasion.'' No one
expected Bryant to ask, ``Monica, if you were a tree what kind
would you be?'' but it was astonishing to read such a tone-deaf
reference to ``salacious'' meetings. None of those clips were
played Saturday, and the letdown hints at what the public still
longs for: the human story beneath this political ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   It is no accident that Ms. Lewinsky's forthcoming book is called
``Monica's Story,'' or that it is written by Andrew Morton, the
author of the best-selling ``Diana: Her True Story,'' which so
effectively spun the sympathetic image of an emotionally wounded
princess. (Not an easy sell when you think about it.) Even Bryant
complained that Ms. Lewinsky ``didn't tell her story'' on the tape
and so should be called as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   The sympathetic tale, the first-person story, is what these
snippets of defensive video testimony can only hint at. However
much it resembled a movie, this was a deposition, with a stationary
camera, off-camera questioner and bad lighting that caused Ms.
Lewinsky's hair to cast shadows on her face. The room was full of
lawyers, but visually Ms. Lewinsky was isolated.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any doubt that Ms Lewinsky's emotional drama is what
matters here, consider how much less intriguing the video clips of
Sidney Blumenthal and even Vernon Jordan were. They are onlookers.
It would have been interesting, though, to see a fuller version of
Jordan talking about how ``alarming'' it was when Ms. Lewinsky
asked if the president would be leaving the first lady after his
term ended. He may have seen yet another Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   We might as well admit that part of the fascination with her is
pure voyeurism. But it is also true that the consequences of this
scandal are weighty, speaking to the country's moral and cultural
divide. The persistence of the story on television comes from its
unbeatable combination of soap opera and news: it is lurid  &UR; and &LR; 
historically important.
</P>
<P>
   And at its heart is Monica Lewinsky's story. For legal as well
as commercial reasons, she seems to be saving the juicy details for
her book and her Barbara Walters interview, and Saturday's video
excerpts were mere promos for them. (Both are on hold until she
gets permission from Kenneth Starr's office.) Strange as it seems,
Ms. Lewinsky has just begun to spin her own story.

THE SCENE: A SHOW OF U.S. SENATORS HEARING LEWINSKY TAPE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was understandable that Sen. Larry Craig got
down to business with his set of multicolored markers Saturday and
doodled his way through much of Monica Lewinsky's appearance by
video snippets at President Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Like others in the trial court, Craig, a Republican from Idaho,
had studied the Lewinsky videotape earlier this past week, but he
still appeared to be keeping an ear out as he doodled. It was as if
Ms. Lewinsky's voice were a soothing bit of soft rock and her face
playing on the Senate television screens a national icon to be
safely taken for granted by now.
</P>
<P>
   Most other senators had no such make-work to get them through a
long and odd day that provided, after all, a certain kind of
spectacle: the sight not so much of Ms. Lewinsky as of themselves
having to watch Ms. Lewinsky talk.
</P>
<P>
   The yearlong ordeal had come to this, the government's highest
deliberative body on display as the court finally tasked with
parsing out witness testimony on behalf of a nation surfeited with
the oft-told tale of the President's misbehavior with the former
White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's listen,'' the senators were told time and again as they
turned to the screens like Orwellian serfs to watch excerpts of Ms.
Lewinsky and two other witnesses presented in selected cameos to
attack or defend the president.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Democrats, John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia
offered an elaborate, Job-like shrug, hands upraised, as the first
Lewinsky riff played in the chamber _ the prosecutors' excerpt of
her totally wholesome testimony about her college education. Next
to him, Tom Harkin of Iowa grinned and shrugged in sympathy, as if
to suggest the sheer wonderment of the Senate having to sit still
for this.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses in the chamber could see wary Democrats seem to slouch
like couch potatoes as the prosecutors artfully wove tape and
oratory to once more argue their case to banish the president. Some
Republicans nodded and smiled openly at points they found salient,
although one, John Chafee of Rhode Island, often consulted his
wristwatch and sometimes closed his eyes as if in some deeper level
of pondering the meaning of Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all heard about the light at the end of the tunnel,''
Chafee said later during a welcome break in the trial. ``We see it
now and are anxious to arrive there.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist had a small television hidden
under his desk that seemed aquarium-like when glimpsed from the
gallery as the pink and black image of Ms. Lewinsky floated on the
screen, her mouth ever moving through the day, her eyes blinking,
her voice rebounding about the Senate chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The judge kept his hand firmly on the tiller, leaving Sen. Trent
Lott, the majority leader, wincing when his routine proposal for a
brief recess was suddenly overruled.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, let's just keep going,'' Rehnquist said with all
deliberate speed, drawing laughs and a few claps of approval from
senators obviously aching to be done with the task sooner rather
than later.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the novelty of the tape excerpts, the day was mainly a
dress rehearsal for the next trial session on Monday, when closing
arguments are expected. The House Republican prosecutors already
seemed knife-sharp for this task.
</P>
<P>
   In the chamber, they denounced the president as a sexual
predator and a legal cheat. Beyond the chamber, they mounted an
eleventh-hour attempt to reopen the evidence docket with fresh
accusations about the veracity of Sidney Blumenthal, the
president's communications strategist whose videotaped testimony
was also shown Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Blumenthal's excerpts appeared to have a more gripping
effect in the chamber than did the Lewinsky snippets. Hillary
Rodham Clinton called him when the scandal allegations emerged,
Blumenthal testified electronically; instantly the clip garnered
attention. The first lady, he continued, said ``the president had
helped troubled persons in the past'' as a compassionate man of
religion and this was the case with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   At this, Republican senators betrayed tight smiles and angry
nods to each other, knowing that the White House ultimately dropped
this defense when the president was finally forced to acknowledge
sexual misbehavior with the intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your president obstructed justice in a mean way,'' Rep.
Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., scathingly told the Senate at the end of
the day, contending that a predawn phone call to Ms. Lewinsky by
the president presented undeniable evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Graham drew the biggest laugh of the day, saying: ``Where I come
from, you call somebody at 2:30 in the morning, you're up to no
good.''
</P>
<P>
   The senators were finally free to go after a seven-hour day. In
the parting bustle, Craig emerged from the chamber with a look of
considerable satisfaction. He clutched his sketch pad.
</P>
<P>
   ``What doodle?'' the senator asked in response to a question.
``This was a  &UR; three &LR; -doodle day,'' he announced, patting his pad.
``I call this my `Impeachment Series.'''

BRYANT'S FAST START ROCKS HARRIS' BOAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The 25 points, the 10 rebounds and the post-game
accolades didn't necessarily guarantee Kobe Bryant an encore
performance as a starter, but he'll get one today anyway.
</P>
<P>
   As the Lakers prepared for their first meeting with Utah since
last May's sweep by the Jazz, coach Del Harris was still working
with a partial roster.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Fox, battling bad shoe insoles and now bone spurs in his
right foot, will sit again today. Robert Horry is due back from
Houston, where his wife gave birth to their second child Friday,
but he will be limited to bench duty.
</P>
<P>
   So it's Bryant and Corie Blount again at the forward slots.
</P>
<P>
   And for Harris, that's a mixed blessing. With Bryant lighting up
Houston's Scottie Pippen on Friday, the questions about Bryant's
role quickly began to irritate the Lakers coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big issue should not be who starts. If it becomes that,
it's a self-defeating kind of thing,'' Harris said. ``We will work
it out, I promise you. There should be better stories, you know,
like when will the coach be fired.''
</P>
<P>
   With Fox's status uncertain, Bryant could get a couple of more
starts, and if he continues playing the way he did Friday . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Del's gonna have a tough decision coming up, because he looked
pretty good starting,'' Shaquille O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   Count Pippen among the impressed. The former Bull struggled to
get any offense going as Bryant blocked his shot twice and picked
him once in the first half. Pippen finished with 10 points and did
little to slow Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a little bit more patient, it seems (this year),'' Pippen
said of Bryant's offense. And as for his defense: ``I didn't think
I shot the ball well. I have to give him credit, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Shuffling: The lack of Horry and Fox made for some interesting
use of the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Center Elden Campbell, who lost his starting job as power
forward last year, played alongside O'Neal for several stretches
and was fairly effective, with six points and five rebounds in 15
minutes. Seldom-used center Sean Rooks also spent some time on the
floor with O'Neal, logged 10 minutes and helped keep Charles
Barkley in check.
</P>
<P>
   Nerves: Bryant sounded as cool as he played before his big
night, but point guard Derek Fisher, also making his first career
opening-night start, was fighting off some butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't sleep well at all (Thursday) night,'' he said.
``Starting the season is definitely something I've looked forward
to for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The nerves showed a bit. Fisher managed only three points and
three assists in 23 minutes. Veteran Derek Harper played 31 minutes
at both the point and shooting guard, finishing with 16 points and
seven assists.
</P>
<P>
   Boarding school: The Lakers won the rebounding battle Friday
47-44, but the encouraging part to Harris was where the rebounds
came from. Bryant got 10 from the small forward spot and guard
Eddie Jones grabbed eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is really key for us and something that has to be
rewarded when it happens and noticed,'' Harris said, ``because
that's where we've gotta do better. Yes we want to do better
rebounding from the four (power forward), but we have to do it at
the one, two and three spots.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Fox's sore feet, and delays in getting the proper
shoe insoles, leave him questionable for Monday's game at San
Antonio. Campbell is nursing a sprain in his right hand but will
play today. Jones has a slight contusion in his right thigh but
won't miss any playing time.

EXPLOIT EARNS IMPRESSIVE WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ If supper doesn't begin until the hostess lifts her
fork, then the Kentucky Derby prep season doesn't begin until the
future-book favorite makes his 3-year-old debut. Saturday, it was
(begin ital)bon appetite(end ital) for horseplayers.
</P>
<P>
   Exploit was in the starting gate for the $150,000 San Vicente
Stakes, and although it was a short race with only three horses,
the unbeaten colt's presence raised the anticipation at Santa Anita
on a day ostensibly headlined by the $500,000 Strub Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   And Exploit did nothing to discourage his admirers. He put away
a classy sprinter midway through the 7-furlong race, turned back
another rival who had the momentum in the stretch, and won by an
all-out neck under Chris McCarron to run his record to 5 for 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does not like to get beat,'' said trainer Bob Baffert, who
will be shooting for an unprecedented third straight Derby victory
if Exploit _ or any of Baffert's string of contenders _ makes it to
Churchill Downs on May 1. ``I like that about him.''
</P>
<P>
   If Exploit can be compared to either of Baffert's Derby winners,
Silver Charm and Real Quiet, the obvious choice would be the
former, the 1997 San Vicente winner. Exploit and Silver Charm have
the same owners, Bob and Beverly Lewis of Newport Beach, and as
Baffert noted, similar spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reminds me of Silver Charm in the way that he likes a
fight,'' Baffert said.
</P>
<P>
   Exploit (who paid $3.20) won by a neck over Aristotle as early
leader Yes It's True faded to a distant last. Exploit was timed in
1:22.00 on a track that had just been upgraded from ``good'' to
``fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory margin was the narrowest of Exploit's career, which
left off in November with a 1 }-length score over Vicar in the 1
1/16-mile Kentucky Jockey Club Stakes at Churchill.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's (begin ital)other(end ital) stakes, the historic
Strub for 4-year-olds, was won by heavily favored Event of the Year
and jockey Corey Nakatani.
</P>
<P>
   Event of the Year was the Derby favorite for a brief time in '98
_ until he injured a knee in training eight days before the race.
The son of Seattle Slew missed nine months and, before he came
back, he was moved by owners John and Betty Mabee from Jerry
Hollendorfer's barn in the San Francisco Bay Area to Richard
Mandella's barn here.
</P>
<P>
   Mandella said he didn't lose confidence when Event of the Year
finished third to Run Man Run in the Malibu Stakes _ spoiling what
had been a 4-for-4 record _ and second to Dixie Dot Com in the San
Fernando.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very, very good horse,'' Mandella said. ``He just had a
little bit of learning to do.''
</P>
<P>
   With Dixie Dot Com injured and out of the Strub, Event of the
Year ($4) won the 1 [-mile race by 2 } lengths over Dr Fong.
Hanuman Highway was third at 24-1.
</P>
<P>
   Event of the Year strengthens Mandella's hand for the March 6
Santa Anita Handicap, which the trainer won the past two years with
Siphon and Malek. Mandella plans to run Malek.
</P>
<P>
   He indicated Donn Handicap winner Puerto Madero will run in the
Big 'Cap too if it won't interfere with his plans for the March 28
Dubai World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Such mouth-watering anticipation was in the air Saturday.
Baffert's plans for Exploit includes the Feb. 28 San Rafael or the
March 13 San Felipe and then the April 3 Santa Anita Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Eddie Delahoussaye had a second and a third but no
victories at Santa Anita. He'll have seven chances today to ride
No. 6,000.... Run Man Run, sixth in the Strub, pulled up lame....
Bob Baffert-trained Censored and David Flores won the $132,700 Pro
or Con Handicap.... Free House, making his 5-year-old debut, is 7-5
on the morning line for the San Antonio Handicap today. Malek is
2-1. Cavonnier could be scratched if Baffert isn't sold on the
track condition.... Manistique is 3-5 against six fillies in the La
Canada.... Trainer John Shirreffs won his fifth in a row when
Cliquot ($3.40), a photo loser to General Challenge in November,
broke his maiden in 1:09.10.... In Florida, Yagli ($3.20), with
Jerry Bailey, came through on the hedge to win the Gulfstream Park
Breeders' Cup Handicap in his first start since running second in
the Hollywood Turf Cup.

JORDAN MOURNS AS KING NEARS DEATH; POLITICAL POWER TRANSFERRED TO
HIS SON
<TEXT>
<P>
   By DEBORAH HORAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Special to the Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ Jordan's government declared a dying King
Hussein no longer able to govern Saturday and handed full powers to
his son and politically untested heir, Crown Prince Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting at the prime minister's office, Cabinet members
gave Abdullah, a 37-year-old career military officer who was named
successor less than two weeks ago, all powers as head of state.
</P>
<P>
   The king's physician, Samir Farraj, said in a statement that
Hussein, gravely ill from cancer, had suffered kidney and liver
failure and that his heart and brain were functioning. Other
officials said the king was hooked up to a life-support machine and
heavily sedated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest is in God's hands,'' Jordan's ambassador to the
United States, Murwan Muasher, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 people remained outside the hospital where the
63-year-old Hussein lay dying. His American-born wife, Queen Noor,
and four of his sons wandered through the crowd Saturday, thanking
the people for their sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Abdullah was regent during the brief period when Hussein
returned for a bone marrow transplant in the United States. But the
treatment failed, and death is expected once the cancer reaches the
heart, a source said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's ceremony made Abdullah the head of state, and he was
given supreme authority, including the powers to mobilize the army,
dismiss the parliament and appoint the Cabinet. But little is known
about the man or his policies.
</P>
<P>
   A career army officer in charge of elite commandos responsible
for maintaining Jordan's internal security and the royal family's
safety, Abdullah, clean-cut and baby-faced, has yet to reveal much
about himself to Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the country's Special Operations Command, he shied
away from politics. Six months ago, when asked by a local Arabic
newspaper whether he would want to be king one day, he replied it
was an ``unfair question.'' He added that anything he said ``would
be misunderstood.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Abdullah was quoted by the London-based al-Hayat
newspaper as saying, ``We hope that the transition to power will be
in the best and easiest arrangements possible. I have instructions
from His Majesty the King to execute his advice to achieve what is
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordanian analysts and Western diplomats said they expect
Abdullah to follow in Hussein's footsteps, particularly on two
policy questions crucial to the United States: support for peace
with Israel and acquiescence to America's policy toward Iraq.
During Hussein's 47-year reign, Jordan had become a reliable U.S.
ally and key supporter of Middle East peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Persian Gulf states, longtime financial backers of Jordan, now
worry about ripples from any upheavals in the strategically located
but resource-poor kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington Saturday, President Clinton asked Congress to
speed up aid to Jordan, reflecting the belief that a weak economy
may be the main threat facing Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that the administration is also working with its
allies and international lending institutions and its allies to
help Jordan deal with its foreign debt, according to The Associated
Press. ``The United States stands by Jordan and is determined to do
all that it can to support it and strengthen it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Amman, Western diplomats were speaking well of Abdullah as a
man with good business connections who is concerned about
maintaining Jordan's security.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the army's special forces, he was involved with
weapons procurement for Jordan, often roaming the halls of Capitol
Hill to lobby for military aid. In 1998, he was instrumental in
tripling U.S. aid to Jordan to $225 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Hill, talking to senators, he was effective and
articulate in getting weapons from Congress,'' said one diplomat
here, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``He presented Jordan's
case without a lot of hand-wringing.''
</P>
<P>
   Such expressions of support sparked suspicion among some in
Jordan that the administration was instrumental in Hussein's abrupt
appointment of Abdullah as crown prince last month, just two days
after the king dismissed his brother, Prince Hassan, from the post
he had held for 34 years.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jordanians believe the United States wanted a weaker leader
who would be dependent on a Jordanian military with close ties to
the Pentagon and the CIA and unable to effectively challenge
American policy in the region. U.S. officials deny that the
administration supported the appointment of one prince over
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hassan would have had a word to say, like the king did during
the Gulf War,'' said Laila Hamarneh, one of Jordan's leading
opposition figures. She was referring to Hussein's pro-Iraqi stance
during the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Hassan would have said, `We failed in the peace with
Israel,''' she said. ``This cannot be done with the leader who is
coming now.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Prince Hassan's reputation for aloofness, he had popular
support for his seeming willingness to support human rights and
democracy, and backing from the rank-and-file Bedouins who make up
the backbone of the army.
</P>
<P>
   But most of Jordan's 4.3 million citizens seem willing to accept
Abdullah, whose penchant for daring, love of race cars and easy
charm reminds many middle-aged Jordanians of King Hussein in his
prime. Even the prince's resonant voice reminds them of Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Jordan's 3 million Palestinians say they are happy with
Abdullah because of his wife: Princess Ranya, the mother of his two
children, Prince Hussein, 4, and Princess Iman, 2, is a Palestinian
from a prominent West Bank family, who was raised in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his poor Arabic, the result of years of schooling in the
United States and Britain _ including the British military academy
at Sandhurst and Georgetown University in Washington _ Abdullah
impressed visiting gulf dignitaries whom he hosted days after being
named Hussein's successor.
</P>
<P>
   He is said to have good ties with his generation of Persian Gulf
princes, a potential future asset.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Jordan seems to be mending the rift with Kuwait caused
by King Hussein's support of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein during the
1991 Gulf War. Kuwait has allowed a Jordanian representative into
the oil-rich gulf state to reopen an embassy there.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein's support for Iraq was one of the few
miscalculations he made during nearly half a century of rule,
Jordanian analysts say. Long before he was slated to be king,
Abdullah seemed aware that his father would leave a towering
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, the prince said: ``I would die happy if I
realized even a fraction of what my father has realized.''

PUBLIC HEARS LEWINSKY'S STORY AS VIDEOS ARE PLAYED IN SENATE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to replace earlier Rosenbaum story with same slug)  By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica Lewinsky spoke to the Senate and the world
Saturday, via videotape, about her extramarital affair with
President Clinton, which plunged him and the nation into an
impeachment ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Although she has repeatedly testified that no one ever asked her
to lie under oath about the affair, Ms. Lewinsky said she knew from
the start that if she was subpoenaed to testify in the Paula Jones
case, ``I would deny the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why, she answered, ``Because it was part of the pattern of
the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The House prosecutors vividly juxtaposed the image of Ms.
Lewinsky, 25, wearing a demure dark suit and a strand of pearls,
raising her small, almost childlike right hand and swearing to tell
the truth, with one of Clinton, 52, wagging his finger at a news
conference in January 1998 and denying having sexual relations with
``that woman, Ms. Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   In a kind of minidocumentary, the prosecutors mixed taped
excerpts of this week's depositions by Ms. Lewinsky with selections
from those of Vernon Jordan, the presidential confidant, and Sidney
Blumenthal, the White House aide, to buttress their case against
Clinton. They also showed selections from the president's sworn
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence, the prosecutors argued, depicted a web of actions
designed to conceal the truth, with Clinton squarely at its center.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina called Clinton's story ``a
fraud and a farce.'' In the prosecution's final words of the day,
which reflected the Republicans' frustration as they watch the
prospect of conviction ebbing, he said: ``The last people in the
United States to straighten it out is the United States Senate. God
bless you in your endeavors.''
</P>
<P>
   In rebuttal, Nicole Seligman, one of Clinton's private lawyers,
said the Republicans had ``cleverly snipped,'' ``distorted'' and
``omitted'' from Ms. Lewinsky's deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Far from strengthening the prosecutors' case against the
president, she said, it ``undermined key elements'' of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shell game,'' said another White House counsel, David
Kendall, ``but there's no shell.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to underline their view that Ms. Lewinsky's and Jordan's
depositions helped their case rather than hurt it, Clinton's
lawyers played back long, unedited passages of their testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and most Senate Democrats had tried earlier this
week to block the public airing of the videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   No riveting new disclosures were made and no fresh arguments
were developed. Much of the long day was a tedious tale, not
twice-told, but a tale some of the weary senators had heard and
read five or six times.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was undeniable drama in the calm, earnest,
occasionally girlish answers of Ms. Lewinsky, who faced her
interrogator squarely, wide-eyed, her face framed by her black
hair. While there was nothing remotely salacious in the questions
or testimony, the Republicans did venture directly into questions
about the extramarital affair itself.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing a conversation with Jordan, Ms. Lewinsky lowered her
eyes and recalled: ``He sort of jokingly said to me, `You know what
your problem is, don't deny it, you are in love with him.' It was
sort of lighthearted in nature.'' And how did she react? ``I
probably blushed or giggled or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Rogan of California worked hard to generate sympathy
for Ms. Lewinsky and to cast Clinton as the villain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica Lewinsky is an intelligent, articulate young woman who
until recently held untarnished hopes for tomorrow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later he added: ``The image of a young woman very much like a
family member or a friend we might know, is an image the president
did not want America to see when his indiscretions with her became
public. When that happened, the president painted Monica Lewinsky
in a very different and callous light.''
</P>
<P>
   Several senators who had seen the videotape of her deposition
earlier had commented on how young Ms. Lewinsky looked. But she
also showed remarkable composure, sticking to the story she had
told the federal grand jury and sounding every bit as well legally
briefed as the practiced Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, some of the lawmakers leaned forward intently to watch
the image of Ms. Lewinsky on large television screens.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   A second element of the strategy adopted by the prosecutors, or
``managers,'' was an effort to separate the affair itself from lies
allegedly told about it and illegal actions allegedly taken to keep
it from becoming public. Such actions, in the form of two articles
charging Clinton with perjury and obstruction of justice, are the
substance of the Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan described Clinton as a man whose whole life showed ``a
continuing pattern of indulging all choices and accepting no
consequences.'' But if the president had merely committed adultery
with Ms. Lewinsky, Rogan conceded, ``we would not be here today.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, who followed Rogan, sought to
build a circumstantial case against the president through the use
of contrasting tape excerpts and a detailed ``timeline.'' But he
frequently resorted to saying ``he had to know'' and ``he must have
thought'' when he lacked direct evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan flatly denied that there was any link between his efforts
to procure a job for Ms. Lewinsky in New York and the false
affidavit she filed in the Jones case. But Hutchinson played
contrasting excerpts of Jordan and Clinton describing the search to
suggest that Clinton knew of the connection and kept Jordan in the
dark about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was acting on behalf of the president,'' Jordan said, having
been told by both Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky that the two had never
had a sexual relationship. Clinton was vaguer: ``He'd given her
some advice, that's all I know about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall concentrated on Jordan, whose videotaped deposition
showed a man supremely confident and totally in command, repeatedly
fighting Hutchinson to a standstill, sometimes smiling wanly,
sometimes almost menacing in his glare.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan on tape, and Kendall in person, flatly denied that there
was any link or any tie-in between Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit and the
job Jordan sought for her.
</P>
<P>
   Was the private-sector job ``in any way dependent on her doing
anything whatsoever?'' Jordan was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Jordan answered forcefully. ``The job was over here and
the affidavit was over there.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more fascinating bits of Jordan's videotape showed
him telling how, when he graduated from the Howard University Law
School in 1960, with no prospects as a black man of any legal work
in his home town, Atlanta, his high school bandmaster had
interceded with a fraternity brother to help him get a job as a
civil rights lawyer. Ever since, Jordan said, he had done what he
could to help deserving young people like Ms. Lewinsky up the
ladder.
</P>
<P>
   A major element of the cover-up accusations involves Ms.
Lewinsky's suggestion to Clinton that she might hide or perhaps
give to his secretary, Betty Currie, gifts that he had given her.
How had he reacted? Ms. Lewinsky was asked for the umpteenth time.
Once again, she said that the president might have replied that he
would think about it but might have said something else or perhaps
nothing at all. The best Hutchinson could do with that was to
suggest that it was not inconsistent with Ms. Currie's subsequent
pick-up of the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan devoted a surprising amount of time to playing back tapes
of Blumenthal's testimony, which dealt with Clinton's account of
his encounters with Ms. Lewinsky, which included the president's
description of Ms. Lewinsky as ``a stalker'' and other statements
that later proved to be untrue.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he thought the president had lied to him,
Blumenthal, who seemed uncharacteristically subdued on the stand,
answered, ``I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson said that while he had never urged her to lie, the
president had allowed Ms. Lewinsky to conclude she could use the
cover story they had previously used if she was called to testify
in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you believe Monica Lewinsky?'' the congressman asked. ``She
is not trying to hammer the president. She is trying to tell the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson continued: ``He says, continue the same lies even
though you're in a court of law, continue in the same pattern.
Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, in my book that's illegal. And
I hate to say it, but that is obstruction of justice by the
president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Seligman described this as an unjustified inference, based
not upon anything the president or Ms. Lewinsky said in the pivotal
telephone call of Dec. 17, 1997, when he and Ms. Lewinsky described
her possible testimony in the Jones case, but on flimsy supposition
by the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The same was true, Ms. Seligman added, about suggestions that
Clinton pressed Ms. Lewinsky to file a false affidavit in the Jones
case. To back her contention, Ms. Seligman then played a more
complete version of the videotape, in which Ms. Lewinsky said,
among other things, that the president did not urge her to falsify
an affidavit or to lie to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, many of those in the chamber were eager to move as soon
as possible to the final roll-call. Several senators were already
working on speeches explaining their votes.
</P>
<P>
   At midafternoon, the majority leader, Sen. Trent Lott of
Mississippi, asked Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who was
presiding, whether the moment was ripe for a brief recess. ``No,''
the chief justice replied to general laughter from the senators,
``Let's keep going.''

JOURNALIST SUBMITS AFFIDAVIT ABOUT LEWINSKY COMMENTS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A free-lance journalist who has been critical of
President Clinton throughout the Lewinsky scandal has provided an
affidavit to House investigators saying that Sidney Blumenthal, a
White House aide, provided him with information disparaging Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit by the journalist, Christopher Hitchens,
contradicts the sworn testimony of Blumenthal, who has maintained
that he was not a source of damaging comments about Ms. Lewinsky,
the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   During questioning by House prosecutors earlier this past week,
Blumenthal, a senior White House communications aide, said that
Clinton had described Ms. Lewinsky to him as a ``stalker.'' But
Blumenthal denied that he had repeated that description of her to
reporters. Asked about the source of such characterizations in news
reports, he said: ``I have no idea how anything came to be
attributed to a White House source.''
</P>
<P>
   William McDaniel, Blumenthal's lawyer, has also said that his
client ``didn't peddle it, he didn't urge people to write about it,
he didn't tell people about it.'' McDaniel previously said that if
journalists felt bound to protect Blumenthal's identity as a
source, ``they're released.''
</P>
<P>
   An official of the House Judiciary Committee said investigators
received a call after Blumenthal's deposition, either late Thursday
or early Friday, saying the committee might want to talk to
Hitchens, a British journalist working in Washington who writes for
Vanity Fair and The Nation magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchens was contacted on Friday by committee investigators who
took an affidavit from him. In the affidavit, Hitchens said that
during lunch last March at the Occidental Grill, a restaurant near
the White House, Blumenthal had said several times that Ms.
Lewinsky was a ``stalker'' and that the president was the
``victim'' of an unstable young woman.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit was circulating on Capitol Hill Saturday night and
was made available by a congressional official sympathetic to the
House case against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Blumenthal said in a statement: ``My testimony
to the Senate was truthful. If someone is saying it was not they
are mistaken.'' Hitchens could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchens also said in the affidavit that Blumenthal had told him
that polling showed that Kathleen Willey, a White House volunteer
who said the president made a sexual advance to her near the Oval
Office, had high approval ratings but that those numbers would not
look as good in several days.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit, which was signed by Hitchens and dated February
5, was turned over to Senate leaders Saturday. The Senate would
have to hold a vote if it wanted to enter the document in the
impeachment record.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit contradicts Blumenthal's deposition and his
testimony before the grand jury. A Republican aide to the House
prosecutors, who insisted on anonymity, said the affidavit ``raises
the specter of perjury by one of the president's chief defenders,''
and that it added to the House case of obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., said that the Justice Department could
investigate false testimony, but that the statement by Hitchens was
``collateral at best'' to the case against the president.

STEWART IS WARMING HIS PRO-AM MITTENS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ The weather changed for the worse
Saturday at Pebble Beach, as did the scores.
</P>
<P>
   Gusts of up to 40 miles an hour, coupled with chilly rain, left
fans shivering and players shaking their heads. What would the AT&AMP;T
Pebble Beach National Pro-Am be without foul weather? In 1996, the
tournament was canceled because of rain. Last year, it took six
months to finish an abbreviated 54-hole tournament, when torrential
rains postponed the final round until August.
</P>
<P>
   Payne Stewart ended the day holding a one-stroke lead over Frank
Lickliter, but with more bad weather predicted for Sunday, nobody
was quite sure when, or how, the tournament would finish. For most
players, Saturday's round was too wet, too cold and too long. Some
players wore mittens, others wore ski caps, and many who missed the
cut were happy to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Those who played at Spyglass Hill and Poppy Hills, two of the
three courses on which the tournament is held, were more fortunate,
because those courses are more inland and not as exposed to the
wind. But those who had the misfortune of playing at Pebble Beach,
where the average score was 79.3, caught the brunt of the winds
howling off the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting a one-over-par 73 at Spyglass, and making a crucial
birdie on the 18th hole, Stewart stood at 10 under par for the
tournament (206) and led by one stroke over Lickliter, who shot 71
at Spyglass. Fred Couples and Jay Williamson were tied for third
place at six under par, after Couples shot a 73 at Poppy Hills and
Williamson shot a 71 at Spyglass.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval shot a 76 at Pebble Beach, dropping him to three
under par for the tournament, seven strokes off the lead. Duval
will have a difficult time winning for the 10th time in his last 30
starts.
</P>
<P>
   But players left the course talking about the weather, not the
golf. Stewart, who started the day holding a three-stroke edge, was
happy that he still had the lead, and that he didn't have
pneumonia. ``I'm whipped,'' said Stewart, a two-time major winner
who is looking for his first victory on the PGA Tour since 1995.
``It was a tough day out there. I'm looking forward to a hot shower
and a lot of sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart may get more sleep than he wants. If play is washed out
Sunday, the tournament could be extended to Monday, although if
Monday's forecast is bad, tour officials have the option of ending
the event at 54 holes. With three complete rounds in the books,
enough holes have been completed to make the tournament official.
However, tour officials would prefer to complete 72 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Considering those circumstances, Stewart's birdie on the par-4,
407-yard No. 18 loomed large, because it gave him sole possession
of the lead, and he will be declared the winner if the event is
stopped after three rounds. Stewart hit a terrific second shot at
No.18, a 5-iron that landed a foot from the hole for an easy tap-in
birdie.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of finish you like,'' Stewart said. ``After I
finished and I heard what the weather forecast is, I was real glad
that I was at 10 under par. I've been on the short end of rainouts.
I want to play golf tomorrow, I'm not saying that I'm praying for
rain. But yeah, the lead was important.''
</P>
<P>
   While Stewart was sitting in an enviable position, others were
trying to forget their rounds. How strong was the wind? During a
practice round earlier this week on the par-3, 186-yard No. 5 at
Spyglass, Stewart used a 3-iron. Saturday, with the wind at his
back, he used a 7-iron. And the wind was even stronger at Pebble
Beach, were nobody broke par, and Paul Stankowski (72) was the only
player to shoot even par.
</P>
<P>
   Some who played at Pebble Beach were fortunate just to make the
54-hole cut, which was three over par. Tiger Woods and Mark
O'Meara, playing together, both barely made the cut, finishing at
three over par. Woods shot a 78, his worst round this year, and
needed a birdie at No. 18 to avoid missing the cut.
</P>
<P>
   CHIP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   Jack Lemmon, the actor who has never made the pro-am cut, missed
for the 24th time. The pro-am cut was 17 under par, and Lemmon and
Peter Jacobsen finished at 14 under. Teams that made the cut
included the singer Glenn Frey and Craig Stadler, who were tied for
the lead at 22 under par; and the baseball players Orel Hershiser,
with David Ogrin (20 under par), and Ken Griffey Jr., with Mark
O'Meara (17 under).

Tyson seeks pity, but Payton fights
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN P. LOPEZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson was sentenced to prison. He called it unfair.
</P>
<P>
   His wife said he was a good man caught in a bad circumstance.
His lawyers said he didn't deserve the persecution. His fans _
somehow, this man still has fans _ packed a courtroom in Maryland
and collectively gasped as the sentence was read.
</P>
<P>
   They acted shocked. Some wept. They acted as if there were
racist undertones and spiteful overtones in it all. They acted as
if we should feel sorry for him.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we should.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Tyson will continue to live in his disturbed, twisted
world whether it is behind bars for another year or more, or out in
the real world, where he never has been able to cope. Always, there
will be some sort of cage and some kind of bars trapping this man.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason to believe Tyson ever will change his
troubled life or do anything for society other than commit crimes
against it, figuratively spitting in its face and then defiantly
declaring he is the victim.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is sentenced to live with himself. And that is something
we should not wish upon anyone.
</P>
<P>
   All of this became remarkably clear last week not just with
Tyson's latest sentence, but with the other sentence handed down on
one of the world's greatest athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Payton, maybe the greatest of Chicago Bears stars, has
done nothing to society other than respect it and entertain it. He
has given us everything he ever had on a football field and then
made a wonderful career for himself in the restaurant and
entertainment fields.
</P>
<P>
   He has done nothing to indicate he ever abused his own body _
drunken binges, raw nights until the wee hours, drugs, rages
against the world.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Payton, 44, was sentenced to what might be death row, the
victim of a rare liver disease that will kill him if a transplant
donor is not found in time.
</P>
<P>
   He looked at us through jaundiced, teary eyes Tuesday. He sat
there, sadly frail and weak, and tried to explain the disease and
how he will try to fight through it like he has fought through
everything else in his life.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't call it an unfair persecution, nor talk about being a
pitiful victim, nor ask us to feel sorry for him. He asked us to
pray with him.
</P>
<P>
   He was brutally honest: ``Hell, yeah, I'm scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we should pray for Payton and hope for him and have faith
in him. He doesn't want our pity, even as he undergoes treatment
and waits for a compatible liver to be found.
</P>
<P>
   The wait could be weeks, months, maybe more than a year. By
then, it might be too late and Payton could be fighting for his
life. Doctors say the disease, primary sclerosing cholangitis, is
incurable and usually proves fatal within two years without a
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Which draws us to the other sad irony of these two sentences
handed down last week.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson has asked for special treatment throughout his criminal
ordeals. He continued to expect special treatment even as he was
sentenced Friday. Part of Tyson's argument against a prison
sentence was his multimillion dollar debt to the Internal Revenue
Service.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't deserve to do time for this crime, Tyson believed,
because there was another crime that he could pay off if he was
free and could fool more fans into more pay-per-view farces. What
sick, twisted logic.
</P>
<P>
   But Payton gets no special treatment. His liver disease doesn't
consider Hall of Fame careers and personal character.
</P>
<P>
   His is just another name on the waiting list. There are other
liver patients in line ahead of him and they, too, have families,
friends and loved ones who are praying their names are called next.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his marvelous career, Payton's talent always gave the
Bears the advantage. Today, Super Bowl rings, All-Pro credentials
and 4.4 speed matter nothing.
</P>
<P>
   It is all so confusing. The temptation is to wonder why such a
thing can happen to a man of dignity and integrity; a man who has
offered the world so much and worked so hard that he should deserve
better than this in return.
</P>
<P>
   We all know that's not how it works. The temptation is to feel
sorry for Payton. The temptation is to pity him.
</P>
<P>
   But we should feel sorry for Tyson. It is Tyson who could live
to be 100, but never escape the cage or have what Payton has known.
</P>
<P>
   Pray for Payton. Hope that he finds the donor and lives to be
100. Have faith that sweetness will win again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to do everything I can do with this,'' Payton said.
``I can't lay around and mope around and hope everything is going
to be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   He's going to fight. And Tyson will sit in a cage.

TRADE RUMORS WON'T END FOR LAKERS' JONES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Eddie Jones glare. Half disgust, half bewilderment, the
expression is usually reserved for referees, but it's been a more
prominent look for Jones even off the court for the last several
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And who can blame him? First, he watched close friend Nick Van
Exel get shipped to Denver in a trade that had ``scapegoat''
written all over it in the wake of the Lakers' playoffs collapse
against Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Then Jones weathered an offseason of trade rumors that him
transplanted to nearly every city in North America. If they were
all true, Jones would have had to expand his closet to accommodate
new jerseys from the Bulls, Timberwolves, Warriors, Kings, Raptors,
Magic and Sixers.
</P>
<P>
   Jones survived the rumor mill long enough to report to Lakers
training camp, where he was dealt back-to-back indignities -- the
(true) rumor of his being offered to Minnesota in the failed Tom
Gugliotta deal and then the possibility (since dismissed) that
Jones would have to share starting time with Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   With each rumor and each Kobe question, Jones' bright demeanor
would devolve into the Glare.
</P>
<P>
   By media day two weeks ago, he'd almost had it. ``I can't let it
go,'' he told the Associated Press, referring to the trade talks.
``I just feel like I can't even feel comfortable. It's ridiculous.
That's what they put me through. I think anybody who's been through
what I've been through would be sick of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, it's not going to end anytime soon. The Lakers
continue to dangle Elden Campbell around the league, often with
Jones as added enticement to take Campbell's $7 million-a-year
salary. That means trade rumors, even specious ones such as the
purported deal with Charlotte for Glenn Rice, will continue to dog
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   (That last one had red herring written all over it, though. The
Lakers' greatest need remains a power forward, not a small forward,
no matter how great a shooter Rice is. And to deal an All-Star and
a valued reserve center for Rice -- who is out six to eight weeks
after elbow surgery -- makes no sense, especially in a 50-game
season.)
</P>
<P>
   But when Bryant performs as he did Friday, it only fuels
speculation that one day soon, there will be room for only one of
them. And the Lakers' $70.9 million deal with Kobe lets you know
he's staying. Jones' contract is up after next season, and he'll
eligible to earn $11 million in the first year of a new deal.
</P>
<P>
   Will the Lakers give Jones that kind of money on top of the $192
million already committed to Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal? It
doesn't seem likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole game is a business,'' Jones said, noting the Van
Exel trade and his own tenuous situation. ``We can't ever forget
that. I will never forget that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, as popular as he is with the Forum crowd, Jones' days of
basking in the ``Ed-die'' chant are probably numbered, with many
more days of the Glare yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   Menace Rodman: Charles Barkley stopped in Los Angeles long
enough to show off his impressively conditioned physique, taunt
Laker fans relentlessly and issue a critique of Dennis Rodman,
who's toying with joining the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd give them a great rebounder. But I think those days are
over when he can just skip practice and all the other stuff,''
Barkley said. ``The team he goes to, he's gonna have to play,
because he can't hide behind Michael (Jordan) and Scottie (Pippen)
anymore. If he's missing practice and games, it's really gonna
affect the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley also made his pitch to fans to watch the post-Jordan,
lockout-shortened NBA season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting, because you don't know who's going to win the
championship,'' he said. ``You don't know who the best team is. I
don't think you know who the MVP is going to be. From a player's
standpoint and a fan's standpoint, this is gonna be a great
season.''
</P>
<P>
   They're not worthy: You really know it's the end of an era when
the lockers of Jordan and Pippen are now occupied by guys named
Rusty LaRue and Matt Steigenga.
</P>
<P>
   And finally: With any luck, the Lakers-Rodman soap opera will
end soon, with Rodman deciding $610,000 isn't enough to entice him
away from that, ahem, acting career.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the outcome, know this: The Rodman pursuit began
and will end with owner Jerry Buss, who struck up a friendship with
enigmatic ex-Bull because they frequent the same nightclubs. If not
for Buss, the Lakers wouldn't be traveling down this potholed road,
but clearer heads in the organization did not prevail on this
issue.

STARS IN 4-WAY SHOOTOUT FOR WEST TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A month into the season, the Phoenix Coyotes made a run at the
best-of-the-Western Conference label with a 14-game unbeaten
streak.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, the Stars reeled off their 15-game unbeaten
streak and claimed the role as leader of the Western world.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Colorado Avalanche rides an 11-game winning streak into
today's 2 p.m. game against the Stars at Reunion Arena to make
their stake in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the Detroit Red Wings, whose streak is at two _ as
in two consecutive Stanley Cup championships.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the Stars, Coyotes and Avalanche having three of the
league's most impressive streaks this season with the Red Wings'
playoff confidence, and the best-of-the-West clash has become high
profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way things started out, you weren't so sure what was going
to happen,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``But coming out of
the break, we've got a heck of a horse race going on here. You've
got some real thoroughbreds and they're starting to find their
stride.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars lead the Western Conference with a 30-9-8 record and
62 points. The Coyotes (26-12-10) have the second-best record, but
as of today would get the fourth-best playoff seed because each
division winner will receive one of the three top playoff seeds.
The Avalanche (28-19-4), meanwhile, has surpassed the Red Wings for
the second seed after starting their recent streak with a sub-.500
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teams that are going to challenge in the playoffs, they
know you really start to get geared up after the All-Star break,''
Hitchcock said. ``Now is the time when teams really start to learn
something about one another.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, the Avalanche might have a better chance at
the Stanley Cup than the Stars. They have overcome inner bickering
that forced the removal of coach Marc Crawford in the off-season
and the trading of the general manager's son, Eric Lacroix, in
November. They have withstood the long holdout of All-Star
defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh and have not lost a game since he
returned to the lineup with a two-year, $6.7 million contract. And
they have overcome an uneven start by goalie Patrick Roy, whose
looming free agency had many wondering whether his days in Colorado
were over.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of letting Roy dangle in trade talks, Avalanche general
manager Pierre Lacroix signed him to a two-year contract extension
for $15 million, and Roy has been Stanley Cup solid since. He was
the NHL's player of the month for January and won his 400th career
game Friday against the Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're playing with a lot of emotion,'' Red Wings associate
coach Dave Lewis said of Colorado. ``They have a lot of great
players, they have character on that team. I'm not surprised they
turned it around.''
</P>
<P>
   It also wouldn't be a surprise to see the Red Wings rip off an
impressive unbeaten streak. Their best run this season is five
consecutive victories, but they're a team that has plenty of
character.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can talk all we want about what we've done at the start of
the season, but these are teams that have been through the playoff
wars,'' Coyotes coach Jim Schoenfeld said. ``You look at a team
like Detroit, and they have a lot of depth and a lot of experience
in big games. That's bound to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings are struggling with injuries. Free-agent
defenseman Uwe Krupp has played only 22 games because of a
herniated disk and Todd Gill is out a month with a broken forearm.
Mix those problems with slow starts by Sergei Fedorov and Slava
Kozlov and you have a team that has lost 22 games after losing 23
all last season.
</P>
<P>
   But should the Wings add a defenseman via trade, they too could
see the kind of turnaround the Avalanche has enjoyed since getting
Ozolinsh back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chemistry of a hockey club is so fragile,'' Avalanche
coach Bob Hartley said. ``You have to work at it piece by piece.
Now we have lots of depth; slowly but surely every part of our game
fell back into place.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartley has combined center Peter Forsberg and Joe Sakic on the
same line in a somewhat controversial decision. Now, instead of the
one-two punch the Stars and Red Wings have sought with their
all-star centers on separate lines, the Avalanche has a team based
on one line's success.
</P>
<P>
   In 19 games together, Sakic and Forsberg have 20 goals for 35
points and are a plus-29.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes have a similar decision concerning Jeremy Roenick
and Keith Tkachuk. Should Schoenfeld play the two together or keep
them apart? It's one part of the chemistry issues that are puzzling
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of what we're doing now is experimenting and finding
the right chemistry,'' Hitchcock said. ``There are probably 20
things that go on behind the scenes with each team that nobody ever
sees, and all of those things go into winning and losing. Right
now, teams are trying to sort through what those things might be.''
But those things start with each of the West's top four having
great players.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are seeing great chemistry from their top line of Mike
Modano, Brett Hull and Jere Lehtinen, have the deepest defense in
the NHL, are getting a consistent season from goalie Ed Belfour and
have the wild card of a potentially healthy Joe Nieuwendyk for the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are seeking a trade to upgrade the Stars have to
remember that if the team stays healthy, they'll have Hull and
Nieuwendyk in the playoffs this season when they didn't have them
last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche has some of the top skill players in the NHL in
Sakic, Forsberg, Ozolinsh, Valeri Kamensky and Adam Deadmarsh. They
also have a top-flight goalie in Roy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Avalanche is leaning heavily upon unproven youth,
including rookies Chris Drury and Milan Hejduk.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes have stars in Roenick and Tkachuk, a tough veteran
leader in Rick Tocchet, an outstanding goalie in Nikolai Khabibulin
and possibly the second-best defense in the league behind the
Stars'.
</P>
<P>
   However, they also have concerns centering on whether their
five-man defense will burn out and whether their sometimes
combustible lineup will stay cool.
</P>
<P>
   And the Red Wings have enough talent to have won the past two
Stanley Cups. Fedorov, Steve Yzerman, Nicklas Lidstrom, Larry
Murphy, Chris Osgood and Brendan Shanahan are legitimate All-Stars.
The team's greatest strength probably is tough role players like
Martin LaPointe, Darren McCarty and Toma Holmstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Although that group can turn it around at any time, there are
serious concerns about the ability of the Red Wings, the weakening
of the goaltending, the lack of depth on defense and the lack of
scoring from the role players. Which way any one of those four
concerns turns will help determine the Red Wings' fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, that's the same for all four of the West's best. The
Stars, Coyotes and Avalanche each have had down times this season,
and a poorly timed down time in the playoffs can spell the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think guys are jumping up and down yet,'' Avalanche
winger Claude Lemieux said of his team's streak. ``We remember we
had a long period of time when we got pounded and were sucking
wind.''

LEAFS BEAT DEVILS, 3-2  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ In a game marked by spectacular work
from two of the league's best goaltenders, Curtis Joseph and Martin
Brodeur, the Toronto Maple Leafs edged the Devils by 3-2 Saturday
night at Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Petr Sykora and Randy McKay scored goals for the Devils before
the game was nine minutes old. But Joseph shut them out the rest of
the way, finishing with 39 saves, a number of them spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs got two goals, including the winner, from Stevie
Sullivan, and one from Sergei Berezin against Brodeur, who had 17
saves. That was fewer than half of Joseph's total, but a number of
Brodeur's saves came at crucial times, such as when the Devils were
two men short for 57 seconds early in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs have become more offense-minded this season
under the direction of Pat Quinn, the 25th coach in the history of
the legendary franchise, one of the league's six original teams.
Quinn returned to the organization where he made his debut as a
player 30 years ago and has taken the Maple Leafs in the right
direction, molding a productive and exciting team.
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs (30-18-3) have become the highest-scoring team
in the Northeast Division this season. Their leading scorer is Mats
Sundin, the towering Swede, who centers a line of Fredrik Modin and
Steve Thomas, who was with the Devils last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the Maple Leafs had trouble getting their offense going in
the opening period, going without a shot for the first eight
minutes. Sykora and McKay had scored for the Devils by the time the
Maple Leafs awakened from their lethargy.
</P>
<P>
   Sykora scored his fourth goal in four games, and his 17th of the
season, just 2 minutes 31 seconds into the game, when his wrist
shot from the left circle beat Joseph over the glove. McKay scored
his 13th, at 8:46, on a second effort at Joseph's right door step.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Holik, the leading scorer for the Devils, who has been
taking penalties lately in a sign of frustration for failing to
match his early production, created McKay's goal after skating
around the net from left to right. Holik also created a marvelous
opportunity for Denis Pederson, but Pederson's shot was weak from
close range on the left and Joseph covered up.
</P>
<P>
   One of Joseph's biggest saves came 38 seconds before the first
intermission, when he plunged to his right to deny Patrik Elias
after a marvelous set-up by Sykora on the right.
</P>
<P>
   That came just after Sullivan had cut the lead to 2-1 with his
ninth goal of the season, at 17:53 of the period.
</P>
<P>
   The game was played on equal terms for the entire second period,
but it was the Maple Leafs who managed a goal, Berezin's 18th, just
two minutes into the period, to send the teams into the third
period tied at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils had two manpower advantages in the second period, but
failed to capitalize because they were denied by Joseph. First he
stopped Elias in the 10th minute during a penalty to Sullivan, and
then he kicked away Sheldon Souray's shot during a penalty to Tie
Domi.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan redeemed himself for that penalty by scoring the
winning goal with 2:59 left in the game, when, standing to the left
of Brodeur a few feet away, he redirected Sundin's pass from the
other side to the send Devils home disappointed after two victories
on the road.
</P>
<P>
   SLAP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   The presence of Krzyzstof Oliwa, the pugilist for the Devils,
prompted promoters to televise the game in his native Poland and
Oliwa did not disappoint. He was noticed immediately in his first
shift, just under three minutes into the game, when he engaged Tie
Domi, Toronto's policeman, in a fight. Oliwa dominated the early
part of the fight but Domi recovered well. ... Defenseman Kevin
Dean was cleared by the doctors to play after undergoing several
tests for an irregular heartbeat last Monday night, but he did not
play.

TCU LOSES FOURTH IN A ROW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ For TCU coach Billy Tubbs, watching his
Horned Frogs lose to SMU last night felt kind of like watching a
stranger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not the same team that played SMU in Dallas'' on Jan.
11, Tubbs said.
</P>
<P>
   His proof lay before him on a box score _ SMU 94, TCU 92. A
stunned crowd of 7,166 at Daniel-Meyer Coliseum were his witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month ago, TCU went to Dallas and throttled SMU,
92-79. A Top 25 ranking and a certain swagger accompanied Horned
Frogs basketball back then.
</P>
<P>
   Swagger quickly has turned into stagger.
</P>
<P>
   SMU extended TCU's losing streak to four games and a once
pencil-them-in NCAA Tournament berth suddenly looks in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   TCU's usually upbeat and talkative players were at a loss for
answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've lost anything,'' Horned Frogs guard
Shannon Long said. ``I don't know what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs knows.
</P>
<P>
   Adversity has come for TCU, and his players have yet to learn
how to respond to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of adversity come our way, and maybe this will
turn. But we're going to have to go out and make it turn,'' Tubbs
said. ``We just didn't make it happen \Rtonight\S, and time is
starting to run out on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Adversity, once again, included losing preseason All-American
Lee Nailon during crunch time.
</P>
<P>
   He sprained his left ankle while coming down with a rebound. He
hobbled into TCU's locker room with 7:33 remaining and failed to
return. Doctors will examine him this afternoon, but he is listed
as doubtful for Thursday's game against Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Nailon had 22 points, and, maybe more important, 15 rebounds
when he was injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Lee's out, they are a little different,'' Mustangs coach
Mike Dement said. ``Because Lee gets all of the rebounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Minus Nailon's rebounding presence, SMU had a number of second
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Mustangs guard Stephen Woods took advantage. He scorched TCU,
going 6-of-8 on 3-pointers en route to 24 points. He came in
averaging 11.6 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the real key in the game was when Woods starting
knocking down some deep 3's,'' Tubbs said. ``A lot of those were on
our failure to rebound, and I thought that was a key to the game.
We kept making 2's and he kept making 3's.''
</P>
<P>
   SMU held a 53-46 edge in rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Davis led SMU with 14 rebounds and 25 points while Jeryl
Sasser added another 21 points, only six coming in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Horned Frogs forward Marquise Gainous had a game-high 28, but
his 3-point attempt to tie the game with 6 seconds remaining
bounced off the front of the rim.
</P>
<P>
   Only then were SMU players willing to relax, secure in that a
six-game losing streak against TCU had ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were up by seven to Rice with 57 seconds remaining and we
found a way to lose that one,'' Woods said. ``I think they're
offense kind of slowed up, and we took advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   SMU (9-12, 3-5 WAC) stayed in a zone all game, and TCU's sharp
shooters failed to capitalize. TCU's starting guards combined for
to shoot 9-for-20 for 29 points.
</P>
<P>
   Horned Frogs usual spark plug, Ryan Carroll, had an especially
hard game, going 1-for-6 on 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, they were missing some shots,'' Dement said of his
decision to stay in zone instead of going to a man-to-man defense.
``And we were doing a good job getting up on Carroll pretty good in
the zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Horned Frogs battled sporadic shooting, rebounded
poorly and lost Nailon during the most important stretch of the
game. No, that wasn't why they lost.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the final 40 seconds, TCU came down the floor with a
chance to make a game of it. Once, with 25 seconds remaining,
Carroll turned the ball over. The other time, Gainous missed a
3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   That was what was so strange for Tubbs. The last-second,
game-winning, killer-instinct swagger isn't there any more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can come up with a lot of excuses, but I don't think we
need a lot of excuses,'' Tubbs said. ``We just flat got beat.''

A TEACHER FAILED BY FLUNKIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first time you hear what happened to high school teacher
George Alper you find yourself repeating the whole story because
the ending doesn't make sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lemme get this straight,'' you say before echoing what you've
just heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alper wanted his students at Desert Vista High School to have
access to the best technology available. So, he somehow finagled a
$20,000 donation of computer software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, he decided to donate $20,000 of his own money to the
upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Word got around. Students found out. Teachers. School
administrators. When the local school figured out what the teacher
had done, it called a public meeting and, in front of the Alper's
colleagues, students and representatives of the local news media _
``suspended'' him?''
</P>
<P>
   It's true.
</P>
<P>
   All over America, concerned parents have been asking why the
nation's education system isn't as good as it could be or as good
as it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, it turns out, is George Alper.
</P>
<P>
   Desert Vista High School is located in what is called the
Ahwatukee Foothills, along the edges of metropolitan Phoenix. It's
the kind of place where the tide of growth washes away desert sand,
exposing row upon row of stucco houses with red tile roofs. &QL; 
REGULATIONS TO FOLLOW
</P>
<P>
   The high school is governed by the Tempe Union School District,
which, in turn, is governed by the state of Arizona, which, in
turn, is governed by boneheads.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, George Alper would have received a medal and a raise
instead of a five-day suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, a school has regulations to follow when it
comes to buying or selling property. It must request bids and get
price quotes and complete enough paperwork to justify the sorry
existence of bureaucrats and politicians who don't give a damn
about the students in Alper's high school journalism class.
</P>
<P>
   I planned to interview Alper, then use his own words to portray
him as a hero and a role model and maybe the best teacher in
America.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to talk to me.
</P>
<P>
   The polite young student who answered the telephone in Alper's
room at Desert Vista told me, ``Mr. Alper said he no longer wants
to comment on what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't need to.
</P>
<P>
   Alper's actions speak loudly enough. So do those of his school
board. &QL; 
FEAR OF SPREADING
</P>
<P>
   Originally, board members wanted to suspend Alper for 20 days
without pay. They wanted to make an example of him. After all, if
his kind of dedication goes unpunished, it might spread.
</P>
<P>
   Better to nip it in the bud, they figured.
</P>
<P>
   Alper demanded, and got, a public hearing.
</P>
<P>
   One indignant board member declared, ``There has been a
conscious decision on Mr. Alper's part as to which rules he'll
follow and which rules he won't.''
</P>
<P>
   This is true.
</P>
<P>
   Rules which interferred with Alper's ability to teach kids were
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never denied that George didn't follow school policy,''
Alper's attorney, Susan Sendrow, told me. ``The administration
could say, with some validity, that they are a public entity and
work with taxpayer dollars and have a responsibility to be sure the
dollars are working correctly.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Alper willingly accepted the five-day
suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Just as he willingly used his own money to help his students.
</P>

   ``But,'' she added, ``this is George's second career. He was
involved in promoting and merchandising and working with rock and

   It was Mick Jagger who taught us a lesson about satisfaction,
which is hard to get anywhere, including the public schools. It's
always been that way, and will be, until teachers run the show
instead of flunkies. &QL;

A TEACHER FAILED BY FLUNKIES

<TEXT>
<P>
   The first time you hear what happened to high school teacher
George Alper you find yourself repeating the whole story because
the ending doesn't make sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lemme get this straight,'' you say before echoing what you've
just heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alper wanted his students at Desert Vista High School to have
access to the best technology available. So, he somehow finagled a
$20,000 donation of computer software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, he decided to donate $20,000 of his own money to the
upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Word got around. Students found out. Teachers. School
administrators. When the local school figured out what the teacher
had done, it called a public meeting and, in front of the Alper's
colleagues, students and representatives of the local news media _
``suspended'' him?''
</P>
<P>
   It's true.
</P>
<P>
   All over America, concerned parents have been asking why the
nation's education system isn't as good as it could be or as good
as it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, it turns out, is George Alper.
</P>
<P>
   Desert Vista High School is located in what is called the
Ahwatukee Foothills, along the edges of metropolitan Phoenix. It's
the kind of place where the tide of growth washes away desert sand,
exposing row upon row of stucco houses with red tile roofs. &QL; 
REGULATIONS TO FOLLOW
</P>
<P>
   The high school is governed by the Tempe Union School District,
which, in turn, is governed by the state of Arizona, which, in
turn, is governed by boneheads.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, George Alper would have received a medal and a raise
instead of a five-day suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, a school has regulations to follow when it
comes to buying or selling property. It must request bids and get
price quotes and complete enough paperwork to justify the sorry
existence of bureaucrats and politicians who don't give a damn
about the students in Alper's high school journalism class.
</P>
<P>
   I planned to interview Alper, then use his own words to portray
him as a hero and a role model and maybe the best teacher in
America.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to talk to me.
</P>
<P>
   The polite young student who answered the telephone in Alper's
room at Desert Vista told me, ``Mr. Alper said he no longer wants
to comment on what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't need to.
</P>
<P>
   Alper's actions speak loudly enough. So do those of his school
board. &QL; 
FEAR OF SPREADING
</P>
<P>
   Originally, board members wanted to suspend Alper for 20 days
without pay. They wanted to make an example of him. After all, if
his kind of dedication goes unpunished, it might spread.
</P>
<P>
   Better to nip it in the bud, they figured.
</P>
<P>
   Alper demanded, and got, a public hearing.
</P>
<P>
   One indignant board member declared, ``There has been a
conscious decision on Mr. Alper's part as to which rules he'll
follow and which rules he won't.''
</P>
<P>
   This is true.
</P>
<P>
   Rules which interferred with Alper's ability to teach kids were
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never denied that George didn't follow school policy,''
Alper's attorney, Susan Sendrow, told me. ``The administration
could say, with some validity, that they are a public entity and
work with taxpayer dollars and have a responsibility to be sure the
dollars are working correctly.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Alper willingly accepted the five-day
suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Just as he willingly used his own money to help his students.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Sendrow if she could tell me where a school teacher got
$20,000 to give away. She didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' she added, ``this is George's second career. He was
involved in promoting and merchandising and working with rock and
roll groups, including some big names, like the Rolling Stones.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Mick Jagger who taught us a lesson about satisfaction,
which is hard to get anywhere, including the public schools. It's
always been that way, and will be, until teachers run the show
instead of flunkies. &QL;

AIRING LAUNDRY: BEATING WANNA-bULLS SEEMS EMPTY 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ There were balloons and exploding fireworks,
treats for the home crowd and ear-splitting introductions.
</P>
<P>
   But the expected running of the Bulls never took place here
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Like Geraldo opening the Mafia vault, the Utah Jazz's
long-awaited revenge match with Chicago came up a little empty.
</P>
<P>
   If you're into rooting against laundry, maybe you had a fine
time watching the Jazz hold on to defeat the Chicago Wanna-Bulls,
104-96. Because that's what it was.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Floyd and the Pretenders. Unfamiliar men wearing familiar
vestments.
</P>
<P>
   No Michael Whatsisname. No Scottie Pippen. No Dennis Rodman. No
Steve Kerr. No coach Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times have changed,'' said an understating Bill Wennington,
one of only seven who remain in a Chicago uniform from last year's
NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   It was like the homemade sign, one of many at the Delta Center,
that mocked the dismantled, six-time champs:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Bulls,'' the sign read. ``Forgot something?''
</P>
<P>
   This was sad. This was like going to the opera, and being told
that Pauly Shore was taking the place of Pavarotti. This was like
going to see Ebbets Field, and finding only the wrecking ball. This
was, remember, the same court where Jordan sank his final, dramatic
shot and broke all of Utah's heart.
</P>
<P>
   In the balcony at the Delta Center, Todd Adams of Orem, Utah,
was all dressed up and had no one to boo. ``I hate the Bulls,'' he
said, dressed in full-length Jazz purple and green. ``But there's
nobody left to hate.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not exactly true. Seven players and three assistant
coaches are left from last season's championship outfit. But the
Bulls without Jordan qualify as the NBA's ultimate meatless meal.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen is with the Houston Rockets. Luc Longley is with the
Phoenix Suns. Kerr has taken his shot to the San Antonio Spurs.
Rodman is shopping himself to the highest, most desperate bidder.
</P>
<P>
   The only surviving Bulls are Toni Kukoc, Ron Harper, Wennington,
Randy Brown, Rusty LaRue, Keith Booth and Dickey Simpkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our fans are realistic enough to know what's going
on,'' Floyd said after his NBA coaching debut. ``We are undergoing
a tremendous adjustment. We're probably not going to win very many
games.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Floyd has a free ride for the next 12 or so
months. He can't possibly be judged fairly _ not with this cast.
Plus, there are going to be teams, like Utah, who see the Bulls'
laundry and view it as an invitation to settle a sore old score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we supposed to feel sorry for them or something?'' Utah's
Jeff Hornacek asked. ``Don't be ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   In the season opener, however, the Wanna-Bulls hung tough, as if
determined not to lose by the predicted 30 or 40. When Dickey
Simpkins _ Dickey Simpkins? _ put in a Kukoc miss with 32 seconds
left, the Jazz's lead had been trimmed to only five, 101-96.
</P>
<P>
   Kukoc finished with 32 points, fueling the notion that he had
better be ready to go 40-42 minutes a night. The veteran Harper
will be fine at one guard spot. But newcomer Brent Barry, despite
his moments of scoring ballet, is a veritable turnover machine.
</P>
<P>
   His Airness would never approve.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, Jordan's old nemesis, general manager Jerry
Krause, seemed to almost revel in Michael's absence. As late as 10
minutes before the game, he was parked next to new-guy Floyd on the
Bulls' bench _ a brazen breach of protocol when Jordan was still
around.
</P>
<P>
   But these are, alas, Krause's Bulls. His team. His leftovers.
His new coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Us?'' Floyd repeated. ``I don't know about us, yet. I know
what people are saying we are, though, and that's not so pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   What Floyd meant were the predictions that have the Bulls
finishing somewhere between dead-last in the NBA and no better than
fourth in the Big Ten. Everybody's a comedian when they talk about
the Bulls these days.
</P>
<P>
   Wennington himself said he had to go to the trainer and ask for
a few Advils before the opening game. Just how many, someone asked?
``Twenty-two,'' Wennington answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' said Harper, ``if any of the Utah Jazz wants to see a
real championship ring at least once in their lives, I've got one
right here.''
</P>
<P>
   He was holding his jewelry bag and shaking it.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a hollow boast. As the crowd of 19,911 seemed to say
by its subdued applause, beating the Bulls' laundry wasn't nearly
the fun that it could have been.
</P>
<P>
   And that's sad.

SATURDAY HOOP DREAMS: PLAYING FOR THE LOVE OF IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURA TRUJILLO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. _ Driving up Scottsdale Road one Saturday
morning, Dan Welton spotted a couple of guys shooting hoops at
Cactus Park. The next week, he showed up in high tops for a pickup
game.
</P>
<P>
   That was five years ago. The game grew into a weekly ritual for
the 39-year-old Honeywell facilities analyst and about 12 other
guys. They know whatever the weather, come 7:30 on Saturday
mornings, the guys will be there for a game of four-on-four, simply
for the love of basketball.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 miles away, in a crowded arena tonight, the Suns will
host the Denver Nuggets in their first home game since the lockout
kept fans away for the past three months.
</P>
<P>
   But on this wet court, tucked away at this north Scottsdale
park, it's not about salary caps or free agents or ticket prices.
</P>
<P>
   It's about how the ball feels when Marty Polcari dribbles it. Or
what it's like to squeeze through two guards when Matt Rich makes a
layup. It's how a group of guys who only know each other's first
names come together each week for a game on courts across the
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the love of basketball,'' says Polcari, 49, a mortgage
broker, as he rests, waiting to rotate back into the game. ``It's
the way the ball sounds when you make a basket.''
</P>
<P>
   They are engineers, accountants, salesman and lawyers who range
in age from 25 to 49. They have played high school and college ball
and intramurals. They sprain their fingers, swollen so their
wedding rings stay on dresser tops, and hurt their knees so that
they cut out of weekend games early.
</P>
<P>
   They show up as the light breaks, fueled on Circle K coffee and
bagels, dressed in sweat shirts as the game begins. Their breath
disappears into the morning air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over here, over here,'' Rich, 27, calls. He sinks a
two-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   His beagle, Sydney, comes each week, tied to a nearby tree,
barking when the ball edges too close.
</P>
<P>
   As they warm up, Polcari throws his Fighting Irish sweat shirt
to the side, and the squeak of Air Jordans and Reeboks competes
with breath growing heavier.
</P>
<P>
   They trust each other's calls, arguing, but then letting them
stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too much trash talking here,'' says Rich, an engineer,
working on his MBA at the University of Phoenix. ``I used to come
during the week, but this is a calmer group.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, people arrive to swim laps and run on treadmills at the
Cactus Fitness Center, something most of these guys want to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on the treadmill all week,'' says Duane Novosel, 25, an
Ernst and Young consultant, who played ball for Bowling Green
University. ``So it's great to get out, to exercise, to be
outside.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The competition, the intensity is good,'' Welton says. ``It's
fun to improve your skills, it's kind of an addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of them watch college ball all season, others follow the
Suns. But what they love most is their own game, here at Cactus
Park.
</P>
<P>
   They admit that as the years pass, the injuries take longer to
heal. The extra ankle supports fit neatly into socks.
</P>
<P>
   And after two hours, they gather their polar fleece, coffee cups
and pagers, and return to their Camrys, their Volvos and 4Runners,
until next Saturday. &QL;

VAN GUNDY DISAPPOINTED BY LACK OF KNICK `URGENCY'  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ Larry Johnson had finished his interviews and
walked away when he turned back to the assembled reporters Saturday
and said animatedly: ``Write this: When you play Miami, you want
your big No. 34. When you go to war, you want that guy.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be no No. 34 in uniform for the Knicks on Sunday when
they face the Miami Heat in their home opener at Madison Square
Garden, and the absence of Charles Oakley was on their minds as
they finished Saturday's practice session at Purchase College.
Oakley, traded in the off season to Toronto, could be counted on to
push and shove with Alonzo Mourning or P.J. Brown and to greet Tim
Hardaway or Jamal Mashburn with a forearm shiver as they skittered
into the lane.
</P>
<P>
   If the players wondered how they would fare on Sunday without
the forward who had watched their backs, Jeff Van Gundy was already
missing the Oakley who contributed as much on the practice floor as
he did at game time. With a disappointing opening-night loss to the
Orlando Magic behind the Knicks and the rival Heat on the horizon,
Van Gundy was confounded to see his team go through a lackluster
practice Saturday. He kept them long, stretching the session to
nearly three and a half hours, but he was still unimpressed with
the result.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I wasn't the only one having to be upset,'' Van Gundy
said. ``It's all right for them to be upset, too. I just didn't
like the sense of urgency. There just didn't seem to be any sense
of urgency or energy, and we're only two weeks into it. So how we
couldn't have energy, and coming off a loss like we did, how we
couldn't have urgency is sort of surprising to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy added: ``They thought last night was heated and hot.
They haven't seen anything when it comes to competitive from trying
to win a game against Miami. Everything is contested hard. There's
body blows. There's physical contact. It's that way for 48 minutes,
so if you want to win that type of game you've got to be able to
sustain it for 48 minutes. Hopefully, we'll be more ready tomorrow
than today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks are well aware that they need someone to fill
Oakley's role. Right now it does not appear to be the man they
traded Oakley for, Marcus Camby, who saw just 19 seconds of action
on Friday night in the loss at Orlando. On Sunday, Patrick Ewing
will draw Mourning at the start of the game with Johnson covering
Brown, but the Knicks know they will miss Oakley's muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would help, definitely it would,'' Allan Houston said.
``But Oak's gone. We all miss him. It's going to definitely be one
of those games where it sticks out, a game where Oakley would be
important. We have to use what we have.''

NOWITZKI FAILS FIRST TEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Mavericks rookie Dirk Nowitzki failed his
first NBA test.
</P>
<P>
   In 16 minutes of playing time in the Mavericks' season opener
Friday night against the Seattle SuperSonics, Nowitzki produced no
rebounds, two points, four assists and was 0-of-5 from the field
and 2-of-2 from the charity stripe. That's not exactly the grade
the 20-year-old talent from Germany expected in his NBA
examination.
</P>
<P>
   But give Nowitzki credit. He made no excuses and did not blame
others for his failures.
</P>
<P>
   Nowitzki glanced at the scoring line next to his name and saw
statistics he'd never seen next to his name. It was as if he were
watching a horror flick.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much to say, other than I have to play much more
aggressive on both ends and get more rebounds,'' he said. ``For a
6-11 guy to get no rebounds in 16 minutes is unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowitzki gets a chance to redeem himself when the Mavericks play
the Golden State Warriors at 8 tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks coach/general manager Don Nelson wasn't thrilled with
the performance of the player he thinks so highly of. The no-show
by Nowitzki forced Nelson into playing backup small forward Cedric
Ceballos 37 minutes in the 92-86 overtime loss to the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't feel that \RNowitzki\S was playing very well,''
Nelson said. ``He got no rebounds in 16 minutes, and that's a
priority for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went with Ced, and I thought Ced was playing great. We'll
play it game-to-game with Nowitzki, but he needs to rebound.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said he was not trying to send a message to Nowitzki by
playing him only 16 minutes _ barely enough time to crack a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no message here,'' Nelson said. ``He's 20 years old,
and we'll deal with each game at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a gradual learning process. But if anybody who
doesn't rebound on the frontline, they really can't play very long,
because that's the weakness that we have.''
</P>
<P>
   During Nowitzki's whirlwind trip to Dallas last summer after the
NBA draft _ when Nelson was trying to convince Nowitzki to come to
the NBA immediately _ Nowitzki kept telling everyone who would
listen that he didn't think he was ready for basketball at this
level. His words were never more true than against the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the game I wasn't really nervous,'' Nowitzki said.
``But when I stepped on the court for the starting five and shook
everybody's hands, I realized where I was, and that was a little
bit of a strange feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as soon as the game started, you're into the game, and the
nervousness went away.''
</P>
<P>
   SuperSonics forward Detlef Schrempf, who is the only other
native of Germany playing in the NBA, said he would rather reserve
judgment on Nowitzki's NBA debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I've ever seen him play, so it's hard
to say,'' Schrempf said. ``He's a big body, he can handle the ball,
and it looks like he's comfortable shooting the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to wait and see and watch him a few more games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle game was shown on live TV in Germany, starting at 4
a.m. German time. And Nowitzki's parents, girlfriend and other
relatives were watching.
</P>
<P>
   However, they probably won't be rushing to hit the rewind button
on the VCR to watch reruns of Nowitzki's first NBA game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the game, I talked to my parents, and they said they
were going to watch it live,'' Nowitzki said. ``Before the game,
you think of that, and about how they're doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as soon as the game started, you're so focused that don't
think about it any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite's Friday's subpar performance, Nowitzki's presence in
the NBA, Schrempf said, is a shot in the arm for foreign players
who aspire to play in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty excited about having him here playing,'' Schrempf
said. ``I think it's great for international basketball, European
basketball and especially German basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I'm looking forward to him having a long career here. I'm
almost done, and he's got many years ahead of him.''

   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from the presentations
Saturday by lawyers for President Clinton in his Senate impeachment
trial:
</P>
<P>
   NICOLE K. SELIGMAN
</P>
<P>
   The House managers have suggested to you that the deposition of
Ms. Lewinsky helped their case. The opposite is true. Ms. Lewinsky
undermined critical aspects of the House managers' obstruction
case.
</P>
<P>
   As those of you who watched the entire video are well aware, the
managers have cleverly snipped here and there in an effort to
present their story, even if as a result, the story they are
telling you is not Ms. Lewinsky's story. They have distorted, they
have omitted and they have created a profoundly erroneous
impression. So let's look at the facts:
</P>
<P>
   In her deposition this week, Ms. Lewinsky reaffirmed her
previous testimony and provided extremely useful supplements to
that testimony. We asked her no questions. Why? Because there was
no need. Her testimony exonerated the President. ...
</P>
<P>
   Article II charges, in Subpart 1, that the President ``on or
about Dec. 17, 1997, corruptly encouraged a witness in a Federal
civil rights action brought against him to execute a sworn
affidavit in that proceeding that he knew to be perjurious, false
and misleading.''...
</P>
<P>
   Let's listen to the testimony of Monica Lewinsky about that Dec.
17 phone call. It's critically important, and we're showing it to
you unvarnished, not in snippets, because the snippets you have
seen are terribly misleading. ...
</P>
<P>
   Questions to Lewinsky
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Bryant Sometime back in December of 1997, in the morning of
December the 17th, did you receive a call from the President?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What was the purpose of that call? What did you talk about?
</P>
<P>
   A. It was threefold: first, to tell me that Ms. Currie's brother
had been killed in a car accident; second, to tell me that my name
was on a witness list for the Paula Jones case, and thirdly, he
mentioned the Christmas present he had for me.
</P>
<P>
   Q. This telephone call was somewhere in the early morning hours
of 2 o'clock to 2:30.
</P>
<P>
   A. Correct.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did it surprise you that he called you so late?
</P>
<P>
   A. No.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Was this your first notice of your name being on the Paula
Jones witness list?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I realize he, he commented about some other things, but I do
want to focus on the witness list.
</P>
<P>
   A. O.K.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did he say anything to you about how he felt concerning this
witness list?
</P>
<P>
   A. He said it broke his heart that, well, that my name was on
the witness list. Can I take a break, please? I'm sorry. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did, did we get your response? We were talking about the
discussion you were having with the President over the telephone,
early morning of the Dec. 17 phone call, and he had, uh, mentioned
that it broke his heart that you were on that list.
</P>
<P>
   A. Correct.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And I think you were about to comment on that further, and
then you needed a break.
</P>
<P>
   A. No.
</P>
<P>
   Q. No.
</P>
<P>
   A. I just wanted to be able to focus. I know this is an
important date, so I felt I need a few moments to be able to focus
on it.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And you're comfortable now with that, with your, you are
ready to talk about that?
</P>
<P>
   A. Comfortable, I don't know, but I'm ready to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Well, I mean comfortable that you can focus on it.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, sir.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Good. Now, with this discussion of the fact that your name
appeared as a witness, had you, had you been asleep that night when
the phone rang?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So were you wide awake by this point? It's the President
calling you, so I guess you're, you wake up.
</P>
<P>
   A. I wouldn't say wide awake.
</P>
<P>
   Q. He expressed to you that your name, you know, again, you
talked about some other things, but he told you your name was on
the list.
</P>
<P>
   A. Correct.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What was your reaction to that?
</P>
<P>
   A. I was scared.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What other discussion did you have in regard to the fact that
your name was on the list? You were scared; he was disappointed, or
it broke his heart. What other discussion did you have?
</P>
<P>
   A. Uh, I believe he said that, uh, and these are not necessarily
direct quotes, but to the best of my memory, that he said something
about that, uh, just because my name was on the list didn't
necessarily mean I'd be subpoenaed. And at some point, I asked him
what I should do if I received a subpoena. He said I should, uh, I
should let Ms. Currie know. Uh.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did he say anything about an affidavit?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Q. What did he say?
</P>
<P>
   A. He said that, uh, that I could possibly file an affidavit if
I, if I were subpoenaed, that I could possibly file an affidavit
maybe to avoid being deposed.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How did he tell you you would avoid being deposed by filing
an affidavit?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think he did.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You just accepted that statement?
</P>
<P>
   A. (Nodding head.)
</P>
<P>
   Q. Yes?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. Yes. Sorry.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are you, uh, strike that. Did he make any representation to
you about what you could say in that affidavit or__
</P>
<P>
   A. No.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What did you understand you would be saying in that affidavit
to avoid testifying?
</P>
<P>
   A. Uh, I believe I've testified to this in the grand jury. To
the best of my recollection, it was, uh, to my mind came, it was a
range of things. I mean, it could either be, uh, something
innocuous or could go as far as having to deny the relationship.
Not being a lawyer nor having gone to law school, I thought it
could be anything.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did he at that point suggest one version or the other
version?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. I didn't even mention that, so there, there wasn't a
further discussion, there was no discussion of what would be in an
affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Q. When you say, uh, it would be, it could have been something
where the relationship was denied, what was your thinking at that
point?
</P>
<P>
   A. I, I, I think I don't understand what you're asking me. I'm
sorry.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Well, based on prior relations with the President, the
concocted stories and those things like that, did this come to
mind? Was there some discussion about that, or did it come to your
mind about these stories, the cover stories?
</P>
<P>
   A. Not in connection with the, not in connection with the
affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How would _ was there any discussion of how you would
accomplish preparing or filing an affidavit at that point?
</P>
<P>
   A. No.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why, why didn't you want to testify? Why would not you, why
would you have wanted to avoid testifying?
</P>
<P>
   A. First of all, I thought it was nobody's business. Second of
all, I didn't want to have anything to do with Paula Jones or her
case. And I guess those two reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You, you have already mentioned that you were not a lawyer
and you had not been to law school, those kinds of things. Did, uh,
did you understand when you _ the potential legal problems that you
could have caused yourself by allowing a false affidavit to be
filed with the court, in a court proceeding?
</P>
<P>
   A. During what time, I mean, I, can you be, I'm sorry.
</P>
<P>
   Q. At this point, I may ask it again at later points, but the
night of the telephone__
</P>
<P>
   A. Are you, are you still referring to Dec. 17?
</P>
<P>
   Q. The night of the phone call, he's suggesting you could file
an affidavit. Did you appreciate the implications of filing a false
affidavit with the court?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think I necessarily thought at that point it would
have to be false, so, no, probably not. I don't, I don't remember
having any thoughts like that, so I imagine I would remember
something like that, and I don't, but__
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you know what an affidavit was?
</P>
<P>
   A. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Of course, you're talking at that time by telephone to the
President, and he's, and he is a lawyer, and he taught law school _
I don't know _ did you know that? Did you know he was a lawyer?
</P>
<P>
   A. I, I think I knew it, but it wasn't something that was
present in my, in my thoughts, as in he's a lawyer, he's telling
me, you know, something.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did the, did the President ever tell you, caution you, that
you had to tell the truth in an affidavit?
</P>
<P>
   A. Not that I recall.
</P>
<P>
   Q. It would have been against his interest in that lawsuit for
you to have told the truth, would it not?
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm not really comfortable, I mean, I can tell you what would
have been in my best interest, but I__
</P>
<P>
   Q. But you didn't file the affidavit for your best interest, did
you?
</P>
<P>
   A. Uh, actually, I did.
</P>
<P>
   Q. To avoid testifying.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But had you testified truthfully, you would have had no,
certainly, no legal implications. It may have been embarrassing,
but you would have not had any legal problems, would you?
</P>
<P>
   A. That's true.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you discuss anything else that night in terms of _ I
would draw your attention to the cover stories. I've alluded to
that earlier. But did you talk about a cover story that night?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, sir.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And what was said?
</P>
<P>
   A. Um, I believe that, um, the President said something _ ``You
can always say you were coming to see Betty or bringing me
papers.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. I think you've testified that you're sure he said that that
night. You are sure he said that that night?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Now was that in connection with the affidavit?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't believe so, no.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why would he have told you you could always say that?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q. We're at that point that we've got a telephone conversation
in the morning with you and the President, and he has, among other
things, mentioned to you that your name is on the Jones witness
list. He has also mentioned to you that perhaps you could file an
affidavit to avoid possible testifying in that case. That's what _
Is that right?
</P>
<P>
   A. Correct.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And he has also, I think, now at the point that we were in
our questioning, referenced the cover story that you and he had
had, that perhaps you could say that ``you were coming to my office
to deliver papers or to see Betty Currie.'' Is that right?
</P>
<P>
   A. Correct. It was from the entire relationship, that story.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Now when he alluded to that cover story, was that instantly
familiar to you?
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You knew what he was talking about?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. O.K. And why was this familiar to you?
</P>
<P>
   A. Because it was part of the pattern of the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Had you actually had to use elements of this cover story in
the past?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think so, yes. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q. O.K. Now let me go back again to the Dec. 11 date _ I'm sorry
_ the 17th. This is the conversation in the morning. What else _
was there anything else you talked about in terms of _ other than
your name being on the list and the affidavit and the cover story?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. I had, I had had my own thoughts on why and how he
should settle the case, and I expressed those thoughts to him. And
at some point he mentioned that he still had this Christmas present
for me and that maybe he would ask Mrs. Currie to come in that
weekend, and I said not to because she was obviously going to be in
mourning because of her brother.
</P>
<P>
   Q. As I understand your testimony, too, the cover stories were
reiterated to you by the President that night on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   A. Correct.
</P>
<P>
   Q. After he told you you would be a witness, or your name was on
the witness list, I should say.
</P>
<P>
   A. Correct.
</P>
<P>
   Q. O.K. And did you understand that since your name was on the
witness list that there would be a possibility that you could be
subpoenaed to testify in the Paula Jones case?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think I understood that I could be subpoenaed, and there
was a possibility of testifying. I don't know if I necessarily
thought it was a subpoena to testify, but__
</P>
<P>
   Q. Were you in fact subpoenaed to testify?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And that was what__
</P>
<P>
   A. Dec. 19, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Dec. 19. Now, you have testified in the grand jury _ I think
your closing comments was that no one ever asked you to lie. But
yet in that very conversation of Dec. 17, 1997, when the President
told you that you were on the witness list, he also suggested that
you could sign an affidavit and use misleading cover stories; isn't
that correct?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I guess in my mind, I separate necessarily signing
affidavit and using misleading cover stories. So, does__
</P>
<P>
   Q. Well, those two__
</P>
<P>
   A. Those three events occurred, but they don't, they weren't
linked for me.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But they were in the same conversation, were they not?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, they were.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you understand in the context of the conversation that
you would deny the, the President and your relationship to the
Jones lawyers?
</P>
<P>
   A. Do you mean from what was said to me or__
</P>
<P>
   Q. In the context of that, in the context of that conversation,
Dec. 17.
</P>
<P>
   A. I, I don't, I didn't__
</P>
<P>
   Q. O.K. Let me ask it. Did you understand in the context of the
telephone conversation with the President that early morning of
Dec. 17, did you understand that you would deny your relationship
with the President to the Jones lawyers through use of these cover
stories?
</P>
<P>
   A. From what I learned in that. Oh, through those cover stories,
I don't know, but from what I learned in that conversation, I
thought to myself I knew I would deny the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And you would deny the relationship to the Jones lawyers?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, correct.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Good.
</P>
<P>
   A. If, if that's what it came to.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And in fact you did deny the relationship to the Jones
lawyers in the affidavit that you signed under penalty of perjury;
is that right?
</P>
<P>
   A. I denied a sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The President did not in that conversation on December the
17th of 1997 or any other conversation, for that matter, instruct
you to tell the truth; is that correct?
</P>
<P>
   A. That's correct.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And prior to being on the witness list, you both spoke__
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I guess any conversation in relation to the Paula Jones
case. I can't say that any conversation from the entire
relationship; that he didn't ever say, you know: ``Are you mad?
Tell me the truth.'' So__
</P>
<P>
   Q. And prior to being on the witness list, you both spoke about
denying this relationship if asked?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. That was discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Q. He would say something to the effect that _ or you would say
that you would deny anything, if it ever came up. And he would nod
or say, ``That's good,'' something to that effect. Is that right?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, I believe I testified to that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. In his answer to this proceeding in the Senate, he has
indicated that he thought he might have had a way that he could
have you _ get you to file basically a true affidavit but yet still
skirt these issues enough that you wouldn't be called as a witness.
Did he offer you any of these suggestions at this time?
</P>
<P>
   A. He didn't discuss the content of my affidavit with me, at
all, ever.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   MS. SELIGMAN
</P>
<P>
   Now, where does this leave us? Ms. Lewinsky described a brief
conversation in which the President mentioned the possibility that
an affidavit might enable her to avoid testifying if the need for
it arose, and they left the subject.
</P>
<P>
   No discussion of content. No discussion of logistics. No
discussion of timing. Virtually no discussion at all. And that very
brief exchange is the heart of the case. ...
</P>
<P>
   Now, we've been discussing Subpart 1 of Article II, the
affidavit allegation. But this testimony also undermines Subpart 2
of Article II, which alleges that the President obstructed justice
in that very same phone call by encouraging Ms. Lewinsky to lie in
testimony that she might give.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky previously denied that she and the President ever
discussed the content of any deposition testimony in that
conversation. That happened before this week. Indeed, she had told
the F.B.I. that she and the President never discussed what to say
about her visits to the White House in the context of the Paula
Jones case. And the managers themselves said in a press release on
Jan. 19 of this year that the President and Ms. Lewinsky, quote,
``Did not discuss the deposition that evening because Monica had
not yet been subpoenaed.''
</P>
<P>
   So it's not entirely surprising that the managers did not ask
Ms. Lewinsky to confirm that she and the President talked about the
testimony in this call, even though that's where the obstruction
allegedly occurred. They didn't ask her about that this week
because they knew the answer; they knew the answer was no. ...
</P>
<P>
   Discussion of Gifts
</P>
<P>
   Now, the managers have indicated to you that Ms. Lewinsky
provided testimony useful to their case with respect to the
President's involvement in the transfer of gifts to Ms. Currie. We
must have attended a different deposition. In fact, Ms. Lewinsky's
testimony provides powerful support for the position that Ms.
Lewinsky decided on her own to keep from the Jones lawyers the
gifts she had received from the President. ...
</P>
<P>
   Remember, Ms. Lewinsky received a subpoena on Dec. 19 requesting
gifts she had received from the President. She met with her lawyer,
Frank Carter, on Dec. 22 and she did not speak to the President in
the interim. In her deposition this week, Ms. Lewinsky testified at
some length about how she decided what to bring her attorney, Frank
Carter, in response to that request for gifts.
</P>
<P>
   As we will see, she decided on her own that she would bring only
innocuous things to produce, things that any intern might have in
his or her possession. Again, this was on Dec. 22, well before the
Dec. 28 meeting with the President at which the managers and the
articles say the plan to hide the gifts was hatched.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Bryant O.K. How did you select those items?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky Uh, actually, kind of in an obnoxious way, I guess.
I, I felt that it was important to take the stand with Mr. Carter
and then, I guess, to the Jones people that this was ridiculous,
that they were, they were looking at the wrong person to be
involved in this. And, in fact, that was true. I know and knew
nothing of sexual harassment. So I think I brought the, uh,
Christmas cards, that I'm sure everyone in this room has probably
gotten from the President and First Lady, and considered that
correspondence, and some innocuous pictures and, they were
innocuous. ...
</P>
<P>
   MS. SELIGMAN
</P>
<P>
   So it's clear from this tape that well before Dec. 28, Ms.
Lewinsky had made her own decision for her own reasons not to
produce the gifts. She remained firm in this decision for her own
reasons on Dec. 28 when the President gave her more gifts. ...
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's testimony also confirms what has been clear
throughout these proceedings: that her New York job search efforts
begin in October 1997, well before Ms. Lewinsky was ever named a
potential witness in the Jones case. ...
</P>
<P>
   What has also been confirmed is Ms. Lewinsky's grand jury
testimony that ``no one ever asked me to lie, and I was never
promised a job for my silence.''
</P>
<P>
   We have repeatedly reminded this body of these plain and simple
words with their plain, simple, and exculpatory meaning. The House
managers repeatedly have tried to suggest that these words must
mean something else.
</P>
<P>
   But at no time in their hours of questioning Ms. Lewinsky did
they question her about this pivotal assertion regarding the job
search allegation.
</P>
<P>
   They did not ask her to explain it, to amend it, to qualify it.
They did not challenge it. They did not confront it. They didn't
dare. They knew the answer. They knew there was no quid pro quo.
And their failure to elicit a response speaks volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan Deposition
</P>
<P>
   DAVID KENDALL
</P>
<P>
   The most critical thing about this deposition is it contains no
evidence of any kind which supports the central allegation of
Article II, the obstruction of justice article, that Mr. Jordan's
job search assistance was tied to Ms. Lewinsky testifying in a
certain way or that the President intended Mr. Jordan's assistance
to corruptly influence her testimony. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q. Was your assistance to Ms. Lewinsky which you have described
in any way dependent upon her doing anything whatsoever in the
Paula Jones case?
</P>
<P>
   A. No.
</P>
<P>
   MR. KENDALL
</P>
<P>
   That's direct evidence. That's not circumstantial evidence,
that's unimpugned direct evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Manager Hutchinson emphasized that Mr. Jordan now admits
that he met with Ms. Lewinsky for breakfast on Dec. 31. But Mr.
Jordan also conceded in his deposition that while he has no direct
recollection of it, he also met with Ms. Lewinsky on Nov. 5, a date
well before any of the many managerial-selected dates for the
beginning of the corrupt conspiracy here. ...
</P>
<P>
   Now, you also will recall, I think, that the managers' original
theory was that what catalyzed this job search intensification,
what really kick-started it, was the entry of an order in the Paula
Jones case by Judge Wright on Dec. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Manager Hutchinson told you on Jan. 14 that what triggered _
let's look at the chain of events. The judge _ the witness list
came in, the judge's order came in. That triggered the President
into action and the President triggered Vernon Jordan into action.
That chain reaction here is what moved the job search along.
Remember what else happened on that day, Dec. 11 again. That was
the same day that Judge Wright ruled that the questions about other
relationships could be asked by the Jones attorneys. That was the
theory then, this is now.
</P>
<P>
   We demonstrated in our own presentation, of course, that that
order was entered late in the day at a time when Mr. Jordan was
high in the Atlantic in an airplane on his way to Amsterdam, and
Mr. Hutchinson's _ Manager Hutchinson's _ very able examination did
not try to resuscitate that theory. He didn't even make the
attempt, he didn't ask Mr. Jordan about the Dec. 11th order.
</P>
<P>
   So today, we have a different time line. ...
</P>
<P>
   Now on the subject of quid pro quo, I want to play two excerpts.
...
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Hutchinson: All right. Now, you mentioned that she had sent
you a _ I guess some people refer to it _ a wish list, or a list of
jobs that she _
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Jordan Not jobs _ companies.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Companies that she would be interested in seeking employment
with.
</P>
<P>
   A. That's correct.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And you looked at that, and you determined that you wanted to
go with your own list of friends and companies that you had better
contacts with.
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm sure, Congressman, that you too have been in this
business, and you do know that you can only call people that you
know or feel comfortable in calling.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Absolutely. No question about it. And let me just comment and
ask your response to this, but many times I will be listed as a
reference, and they can take that to any company. You might be
listed as a reference and the name ``Vernon Jordan'' would be a
good reference anywhere, would it not?
</P>
<P>
   A. I would hope so.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And so, even though it was a company that you might not have
the best contact with, you could have been helpful in that regard?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, the fact is I was running the job search, not Ms.
Lewinsky, and therefore, the companies that she brought or listed
were not of interest to me. I knew where I would need to call.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And that is exactly the point, that you looked at getting Ms.
Lewinsky a job as an assignment rather than just something that you
were going to be a reference for.
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know whether I looked upon it as an assignment.
Getting jobs for people is not unusual for me, so I don't view it
as an assignment. I just view it as something that is part of what
I do.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You're acting in behalf of the President when you are trying
to get Ms. Lewinsky a job, and you were in control of the job
search?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q. Now, your meeting with Ms. Lewinsky was on Dec. 11, and I
believe that Ms. Lewinsky has testified that she met with the
President on Dec. 5 _ excuse me, on Dec. 6 _ at the White House and
complained that her job search was not going anywhere, and the
President then talked to Mr. Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Do you recall the President talking to you about that after that
meeting?
</P>
<P>
   A. I do not have a specific recollection of the President saying
to me anything about having met with Ms. Lewinsky. The President
has never told me that he met with Ms. Lewinsky, as best as I can
recollect. I, I am aware that she was in a state of anxiety about
going to work. She was in a state of anxiety in addition because
her lease at Watergate, at the Watergate, was to expire Dec. 31.
And there was a part of Ms. Lewinsky, I think, that thought that
because she was coming to me, that she could come today and that
she would have a job tomorrow. That is not an unusual
misapprehension, and it's not limited to White House interns.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I mentioned her meeting with the President on the same day,
Dec. 6. I believe the record shows the President met with his
lawyers and learned that Ms. Lewinsky was on the Jones witness
list. Now, did you subsequently meet with the President on the next
day, Dec. 7?
</P>
<P>
   A. I may have met with the President. I'd have to, I mean, I'd
have to look. I'd have to look. I don't know whether I did or not.
</P>
<P>
   Q. If you would like to confer, I believe the record shows that,
but I'd like to establish that through your testimony. ... All
right. So you met with the President on Dec. 7. And was it the next
day after that, Dec. 8, that Ms. Lewinsky called to set up the job
meeting with you on Dec. 11?
</P>
<P>
   A. I believe that is correct. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q. And on either of these conversations that I've referenced
that you had with the President after the witness list came out,
your conversation on Dec. 7, and your conversation sometime after
the 11th, did the President tell you that Ms. Monica Lewinsky was
on the witness list in the Jones case?
</P>
<P>
   A. He did not.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And did you consider this information to be important in your
efforts to be helpful to Ms. Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   A. I never thought about it.
</P>
<P>
   MR. KENDALL
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Jordan found out about Ms. Lewinsky's subpoena on Dec. 19
when a weeping Ms. Lewinsky telephoned him and came to his office.
Mr. Manager Hutchinson played that excerpt from the testimony this
morning. I won't replay it.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Jordan then did what I think is best called due diligence.
He talked to Ms. Lewinsky, got her a lawyer, asked her whether
there was any sexual relationship with the President, and was
assured that there was none. That same evening, he went to the
White House and made a similar inquiry of the President and
received a similar response.

THE SCENE: A SHOW OF U.S. SENATORS HEARING LEWINSKY TAPE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING to change coding)   By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was understandable that Sen. Larry Craig got
down to business with his set of multicolored markers Saturday and
doodled his way through much of Monica Lewinsky's appearance by
video snippets at President Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Like others in the trial court, Craig, a Republican from Idaho,
had studied the Lewinsky videotape earlier this past week, but he
still appeared to be keeping an ear out as he doodled. It was as if
Ms. Lewinsky's voice were a soothing bit of soft rock and her face
playing on the Senate television screens a national icon to be
safely taken for granted by now.
</P>
<P>
   Most other senators had no such make-work to get them through a
long and odd day that provided, after all, a certain kind of
spectacle: the sight not so much of Ms. Lewinsky as of themselves
having to watch Ms. Lewinsky talk.
</P>
<P>
   The yearlong ordeal had come to this, the government's highest
deliberative body on display as the court finally tasked with
parsing out witness testimony on behalf of a nation surfeited with
the oft-told tale of the President's misbehavior with the former
White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's listen,'' the senators were told time and again as they
turned to the screens like Orwellian serfs to watch excerpts of Ms.
Lewinsky and two other witnesses presented in selected cameos to
attack or defend the president.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Democrats, John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia
offered an elaborate, Job-like shrug, hands upraised, as the first
Lewinsky riff played in the chamber _ the prosecutors' excerpt of
her totally wholesome testimony about her college education. Next
to him, Tom Harkin of Iowa grinned and shrugged in sympathy, as if
to suggest the sheer wonderment of the Senate having to sit still
for this.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses in the chamber could see wary Democrats seem to slouch
like couch potatoes as the prosecutors artfully wove tape and
oratory to once more argue their case to banish the president. Some
Republicans nodded and smiled openly at points they found salient,
although one, John Chafee of Rhode Island, often consulted his
wristwatch and sometimes closed his eyes as if in some deeper level
of pondering the meaning of Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all heard about the light at the end of the tunnel,''
Chafee said later during a welcome break in the trial. ``We see it
now and are anxious to arrive there.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist had a small television hidden
under his desk that seemed aquarium-like when glimpsed from the
gallery as the pink and black image of Ms. Lewinsky floated on the
screen, her mouth ever moving through the day, her eyes blinking,
her voice rebounding about the Senate chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The judge kept his hand firmly on the tiller, leaving Sen. Trent
Lott, the majority leader, wincing when his routine proposal for a
brief recess was suddenly overruled.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, let's just keep going,'' Rehnquist said with all
deliberate speed, drawing laughs and a few claps of approval from
senators obviously aching to be done with the task sooner rather
than later.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the novelty of the tape excerpts, the day was mainly a
dress rehearsal for the next trial session on Monday, when closing
arguments are expected. The House Republican prosecutors already
seemed knife-sharp for this task.
</P>
<P>
   In the chamber, they denounced the president as a sexual
predator and a legal cheat. Beyond the chamber, they mounted an
eleventh-hour attempt to reopen the evidence docket with fresh
accusations about the veracity of Sidney Blumenthal, the
president's communications strategist whose videotaped testimony
was also shown Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Blumenthal's excerpts appeared to have a more gripping
effect in the chamber than did the Lewinsky snippets. Hillary
Rodham Clinton called him when the scandal allegations emerged,
Blumenthal testified electronically; instantly the clip garnered
attention. The first lady, he continued, said ``the president had
helped troubled persons in the past'' as a compassionate man of
religion and this was the case with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   At this, Republican senators betrayed tight smiles and angry
nods to each other, knowing that the White House ultimately dropped
this defense when the president was finally forced to acknowledge
sexual misbehavior with the intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your president obstructed justice in a mean way,'' Rep.
Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., scathingly told the Senate at the end of
the day, contending that a predawn phone call to Ms. Lewinsky by
the president presented undeniable evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Graham drew the biggest laugh of the day, saying: ``Where I come
from, you call somebody at 2:30 in the morning, you're up to no
good.''
</P>
<P>
   The senators were finally free to go after a seven-hour day. In
the parting bustle, Craig emerged from the chamber with a look of
considerable satisfaction. He clutched his sketch pad.
</P>
<P>
   ``What doodle?'' the senator asked in response to a question.
``This was a  &UR; three &LR; -doodle day,'' he announced, patting his pad.
``I call this my `Impeachment Series.'''

SAFE AT HOME, PEPPERDINE GETS REVENGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU _ It's an event reserved for a splendid fall afternoon on
most campuses, when the alumni come home and create a buzz of
excitement that fills a football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Pick any day to visit Pepperdine's campus and you'll get the
majestic afternoon, but since the Waves have no football program,
homecoming is reserved for another time.
</P>
<P>
   Like Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Which is when the rejuvenated Waves made amends for a loss at
Loyola Marymount earlier in the week with a 97-83 beating of the
Lions in front of a sellout crowd of 3,315, the largest crowd at
Firestone Fieldhouse in six seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Waves senior forward Marc McDowell, sporting a self-inflicted
crew cut, scored a career-high 24 points and had seven rebounds in
25 minutes. And it helped ease the bad memories of Wednesday's
13-point loss at LMU, when the Lions danced on the court and jumped
atop tables afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were acting like they won a national championship, like
they weren't expecting to beat us, and they probably shouldn't
have,'' McDowell said. ``You get mad because you know it probably
shouldn't have happened, but you can't be mad at anyone but
yourself. I'm glad we got a chance quickly to play them again.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine said much of its energy came from homecoming weekend,
but West Coast Conference leader Gonzaga's loss to San Diego on
Thursday added a little spice. It moved Pepperdine (17-8, 8-2 WCC)
back within a game of Gonzaga for the league lead and, again, sets
up a showdown for first place Feb. 19 in Malibu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys are pretty resilient so they just came to work, but
I'm not going to take away from the fact that I was excited,''
Pepperdine coach Lorenzo Romar said. ``We were pumped up to know
that we had a chance to win the conference again. They were charged
up. They got a second life.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last meeting, Pepperdine was coerced into a run-and-gun
style that better suited the Lions. Though the Waves reached a
season-high in points in the rematch, it wasn't done through
helter-skelter play.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Waves moved the ball well and had easy shots. Led
by McDowell and David Lalazarian (16 points), Pepperdine's bench
produced 50 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was expected from the beginning of the year, for me to
shoot like this, and it hasn't been there,'' said Lalazarian, who
was 3 for 3 from 3-point range. ``To finally get a game like this
under my belt, hopefully it will help my confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Waves point guard Jelani Gardner scored 22 points and had eight
rebounds, but his most significant contribution came less than four
minutes into the game. After picking up his second foul, which is
usually followed by a seat on the bench, Gardner talked Romar into
allowing him to stay on the court.
</P>
<P>
   During the next eight minutes, the Waves went on a 22-10 run to
take a 29-14 lead. LMU (10-12, 5-5) didn't get closer than eight
points again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Let me play. Let me play, coach,' '' Gardner said.
``I was feeling real good. I had a good energy going and I wanted
him to let me to continue to play. I told him I'd be smart.''

(lb) 
 By SCOTT VEALE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA &LR;  By Arthur Golden. Vintage Contemporaries,
$14. This first novel is an audacious ventriloquist act, assuming
the voice of a Japanese woman born in the 1920s who recalls her
metamorphosis from ugly duckling to luminous geisha and kept
mistress. In 1997 the New York Times reviewer John David Morley
found the heroine flatly drawn but said the period details and
``colorful nuggets of information ... serve to enrich'' the book.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; M.F.K. FISHER. A LIFE IN LETTERS: CORRESPONDENCE, 1929-1991 &LR; 
Selected and compiled by Norah K. Barr, Marsha Moran and Patrick
Moran. Counterpoint, $21. The celebrated food writer had a lifelong
addiction to correspondence and is said to have treated letter
writing as a warm-up exercise each morning. This sampling displays
her finely controlled siren voice and reveals the continuing
struggle between the woman and the writer, while artfully
concealing the intimate details of her life. ``It is a special
pleasure to open a book of nearly 500 pages and hear on each one of
them the distinctive, quirky, personable, contradictory and
altogether artful Fisher voice,'' Betty Fussell wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE MAGICIAN'S WIFE &LR;  By Brian Moore. Plume, $12.95. When a
famous French illusionist is sent by Napoleon III on a political
mission to work his magic in North Africa, his wife goes native,
shedding her bourgeois inhibitions and taking up the Muslim cause.
The novelist, who died last month at the age of 77, pulls off ``one
of his neatest tricks yet,'' Thomas Mallon wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SLAVE TRADE: THE STORY OF THE ATLANTIC SLAVE TRADE,
1440-1870 &LR;  By Hugh Thomas. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $20.
Sidestepping the moral outrage that characterizes so many other
books on the topic, the author explores the development of the
slave trade as a business and the many (often complex) characters
involved in the commerce until its demise in the 19th century. In
1997, John Thornton called this ``a fine narrative history, long on
detail and striking anecdote.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AFRICA IN CHAOS &LR;  By George B.N. Ayittey. St. Martin's Griffin,
$18.95. This book focuses on the continent in the postcolonial
years, finding fault with those African and Western liberals who
blame imperialist legacies alone for problems often rooted in
incompetent leadership and home-grown corruption. The result is a
``robust, provocative'' book, Jeremy Harding wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTO THE HOUSE OF THE ANCESTORS: INSIDE THE NEW AFRICA &LR;  By Karl
Maier. Wiley, $14.95. This is a more optimistic look at
contemporary Africa and its diverse peoples, who the author
maintains are bound together by their struggle to build a workable
future. ``He introduces the reader to his subject through a rich
variety of Africans, from computer scientists and doctors to
guerrilla fighters and traditional healers,'' Howard W. French said
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NOBODY'S GIRL &LR;  By Antonya Nelson. Scribner, $12. After the
death of her mother, this novel's 30-ish heroine sends herself into
exile in rural New Mexico, where she falls for a 17-year-old
student in one of her high school classes. Last year the reviewer
Suzanne Ruta said the author ``wraps her tart, surprising sentences
around a slew of trends and shibboleths.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PERDIDO &LR;  By Rick Collignon. Bard/Avon, $10. This takes place in
another dusty corner of New Mexico, where an Anglo construction
worker in the village of Guadalupe finds his sense of belonging
threatened when he starts asking questions about the mysterious
hanging death of a girl. In 1998 Denise Gess called this ``a novel
that captivates and surprises all the way to its chilling end.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PRIDE &LR;  By Lorene Cary. Anchor/Doubleday, $12.95. This story of
the enduring friendship of four middle-class black women is both a
morality tale about the dangers of compromise and a strong argument
that women are just as likely as men to suffer midlife crises. Last
year the reviewer Michael Rovner praised the novel's ``subtle,
idiosyncratic characters.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; W.B. YEATS: A LIFE VOLUME 1: THE APPRENTICE MAGE, 1865-1914 &LR;  By
R.F. Foster. Oxford University, $26.50. The first of two planned
volumes follows William Butler Yeats through his ``Celtic
Twilight'' years to his emergence as a fully formed modern poet.
``The biographer is himself a fine writer, bearing with grace his
knowledge of Irish history, and writing with wit, authority and ...
eloquence,'' Thomas Flanagan wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MY SISTER LIFE: THE STORY OF MY SISTER'S DISAPPEARANCE &LR;  By
Maria Flook. Broadway, $13. The author was 12 when her teen-age
sister, Karen, a ``problem'' child with a history of truancy, drug
abuse and promiscuity, ran away from their home in suburban
Delaware for two years. This memoir ``traces the trajectory of
Karen's disappearance and the fallout of her actions on Maria,''
Courtney Weaver wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; UNDER THE SNOW &LR;  By Kerstin Ekman. Picador USA, $12. This
Swedish mystery, originally published in 1961, revolves around an
eccentric artist and a policeman who team up to solve the murder of
a teacher in a remote village. ``The novel's plot is nicely
convoluted ... with plenty of satisfying revelations and a deft
solution,'' Margot Livesey wrote last year.
