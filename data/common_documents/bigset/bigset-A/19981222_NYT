SMALL SCHOOLS MAKE AN INERNATIONAL EFFORT

<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Green is a well-respected baketball coach who guided
Fairleigh Dickinson to the Northeast Conference tournament
championship and an appearance in the National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament last season. But six of his players
graduated, leaving a void at forward and center.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're just going to recruit in New Jersey, in the metro
area or in the East, it's impossible for me to get a 6-10 player
that can play a little bit,'' Green said Sunday after practice at
the Rothman Center in Hackensack, N.J. ``He's going to be
over-recruited, especially if he's a good student.''
</P>
<P>
   Fairleigh Dickinson, seven miles from Manhattan but far away
from college basketball's elite, must fight Seton Hall, Rutgers and
St. John's for local talent. It usually loses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been knocking our heads out for years trying to get that
caliber of player,'' Green said. ``So to look across the water, so
to speak, and to bring somebody over who has some size to him is
something that you'll probably see a lot more of as the years go
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Green added five international players this season to the two he
already had. Four have received substantial playing time, leading
FDU to a 4-3 record entering Tuesday night's game at St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges have been recruiting foreign players for decades, but
lower-profile schools such as Fairleigh Dickinson are taking their
global search to the extreme. St. Francis of Brooklyn has eight
foreign-born players, and George Washington University has 11. All
three are in urban areas where more prestigious rivals lure the
better local players.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to confine yourself to America to find the
talent you need,'' said Wim Van de Keere, a 6-foot-7-inch Belgian
who was recruited with his twin brother, Tom, to FDU.
</P>
<P>
   Green said a few alumni objected to not allocating more
scholarships for local athletes, but he explained to them that
basketball's borders were torn down long ago. He said that his
foreign athletes were excellent students and were often more
worldly than their American teammates.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's Coach Mike Jarvis built a winner at George Washington
using many foreign athletes. ``It was a chance to be creative and a
way to level the playing field,'' said Jarvis, who directed the
Colonials to a 24-9 record and the NCAA tournament last season with
10 foreign-born players.
</P>
<P>
   FDU's Green recently hired Rob Orellana, an international
recruiting specialist who helped Coach Ron Ganulin work a minor
miracle at St. Francis. The Terriers went from a record of 1-26 in
1993-94 to last season's 15-12 mark, their best in 20 years. St.
Francis, whose roster includes Spanish, Latin American, Estonian
and Cameroonian players, is 5-3 and is expected to contend for the
Northeast Conference title.
</P>
<P>
   James Adams, St. Francis' dean of students, has given Ganulin
carte blanche to recruit internationally, as long as the prospects
are solid students and Ganulin stays within the school's $2 million
operating budget for basketball. (Maryland-Baltimore County, a new
entrant in the Northeast Conference, has a budget of $9 million,
according to Adams.)
</P>
<P>
   Adams said he felt stung by the departure of Venezuela's Roque
Osorio, the team's best player, to a professional league after just
half a season last year. But he has accepted the practice of
recruiting overseas and praised Ganulin for his ambition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I have mixed feelings,'' Adams said. ``I'm
somewhat reluctant to see the nature of the team different than the
nature of the student body it represents. If I had my druthers, I'd
love to see everyone coming from Brooklyn.''
</P>
<P>
   But he conceded that the school had no realistic alternative to
remain competitive in Division I.
</P>
<P>
   Adams predicted that the trend of smaller colleges stockpiling
overseas talent would continue. Orellana agreed, saying it is
cost-effective. He does most of his work through an extensive phone
network and buys cheap off-season airline tickets abroad that are
less expensive than trips to California, he said. Many of Europe's
high school stars now attend the summer basketball camps scouted by
college coaches. And Fairleigh Dickinson can sell its proximity to
New York.
</P>
<P>
   A pickup game at the United Nations could not have more
diversity than FDU's roster. Guard Jesper Rasmussen (13.1 points a
game), the team's best shooter, and center Jonas Sinding (6.7
points, 5.6 rebounds) are from Denmark. Center Chris Ekwe (12.4
points, 6.1 rebounds) of Cameroon and forward Wim Van de Keere (5.7
points) are the two other large contributors. The Knights are
hoping for future production from center Baldur Olafsson of
Iceland, swingman Tom Van de Keere and freshman 7-footer Joern
Grundmann of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players are players, whether they're white, black, red or
blue,'' Green said. ``Regardless, people like to win.''
</P>
<P>
   But Green will spend his only two scholarships next season on
home-grown recruits because there are enough smaller, quicker
players to go around, before looking overseas again.
</P>
<P>
   So far, FDU has signed foreign players who match the Knights'
level of competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping to hit gold one day,'' Orellana said. ``That one
guy nobody knows about in the world. He's out there somewhere.''

LIPA AND UTILITY END CLASH OVER PAY TO EX-OFFICERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINEOLA, N.Y. _ Seeking to put the year of the golden parachute
behind them, the chairmen of the Long Island Power Authority and
Keyspan Energy settled a dispute Monday that arose after $67
million was paid in May as severance to officers of the former Long
Island Lighting Co.
</P>
<P>
   LILCO's former chairman, Dr. William Catacosinos, will still
keep a controversial $42 million severance package. But under the
terms of a separate deal announced Monday, Catacosinos agreed to
move out of Keyspan's Hicksville offices and not try to gain
control of the company for 15 years, in return for an extra year's
worth of executive perks.
</P>
<P>
   The pay packages, which caused a furor among stockholders, state
officials and Long Island residents, were disclosed in June, a week
after LIPA bought most of LILCO's electrical system and the rest of
the utility merged with Brooklyn Union Gas to form what is now
Keyspan. Though the $67 million in payments to Catacosinos and 25
other executives was called severance, the executives initially
retained their jobs at Keyspan.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Gov. George Pataki asked Attorney General Dennis
Vacco to investigate, and the Public Service Commission began a
separate inquiry. The power authority, meanwhile, demanded that the
severance packages be revoked and, in protest, began withholding
payment of monthly management fees to Keyspan. In August, given a
choice between the severance payments or their jobs, nine of the 26
executives stayed on while the rest left the company. LIPA later
resumed its payments.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco has yet to conclude his investigation. A number of other
lawsuits arose in response to the severance pay issue, but most are
close to being settled, a Keyspan executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Monday's settlement, which also ended the Public Service
Commission's involvement in the dispute, the power authority agreed
to release the withheld management fees, totaling $3.4 million with
interest. In return, Keyspan agreed to pay the authority $5.2
million, which it will use to provide postage-paid return envelopes
for customers to mail their checks over the next three years.
Keyspan also assumed $765,000 in legal fees and other costs
stemming from the dispute over executive compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The separate agreement between Keyspan and Catacosinos, dated
Dec. 11, closely resembles one that was signed on July 31 and which
provided the former LILCO chairman a company car and driver, a
secretary, reimbursement for his home security system, and the use
of his office in the former LILCO building in Hicksville, now
Keyspan's Long Island headquarters. His continued presence there,
however, had helped keep alive concerns that Catacosinos might use
his knowledge of LILCO to become involved in an attempted merger or
hostile takeover of the cash-rich Keyspan.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dec. 11 revision, which extends his perks until July 31,
2000, Catacosinos, who is 68, agreed not to try to take control of
Keyspan for 15 years. He also agreed to move out of the Hicksville
building to a new office to be paid for by Keyspan, at up to $2,500
a month in rent, plus $25,000 for furniture. The $42 million
severance payment was not affected by either settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Kessel, chairman of the power authority, and Robert
Catell, chairman of Keyspan, said they hoped the two agreements
would close a difficult chapter. ``This puts the controversy behind
us,'' Kessel said. ``All the issues we raised have been satisfied.
It's a win all around.''

ONCE IN DECLINE, BUS RIDERSHIP SURGES IN NEW YORK CITY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After decades of declining ridership, buses are
suddenly the fastest-growing mode of transport in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   More buses are now surging through New York than ever before,
even outnumbering yellow medallion cabs, and that, transportation
experts say, is a major shift.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 20 years, beginning in the early 1970s, buses were
in steady decline, losing their place on New York's packed pavement
to taxis, vans and private cars.
</P>
<P>
   While the resurgence of buses has clogged traffic even further
on many of the city's busiest thoroughfares, particularly in
midtown Manhattan, the experts say it also holds the promise of a
deep-seated shift in people's commuting habits, and may be
expanding the capacity of mass transit in the country's largest
urban center.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a crucial change, and it is terrific for the city,''
said Elliot G. Sander, director of the Center for Transportation
Policy and Management at New York University, who was the city's
transportation commissioner from 1994 through 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The experts say the surge in bus ridership, which is
particularly evident during the holidays, is largely attributable
to the explosion of tourism in New York City. They also point to
the popularity of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's
unlimited-ride Metrocard and discount fares.
</P>
<P>
   But there may be a more fundamental change at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really comes down to convenience,'' said Ali Faraji, an
Internet Web site designer from Fort Lee, N.J., as he waited at
42nd Street and Third Avenue for one of Manhattan's newest bus
options, the free commuter shuttle to the NY Waterways ferryboat to
Weehawken, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bus may not be luxurious, but it works, and on some days
that's all you can ask,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The city's fleet of buses is expected to grow by more than 10
percent in the next two years to meet the growing demand. But the
fastest growing segment of the local bus industry is made up of the
dozens of private fleets that have sprung up or expanded in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   Data compiled by New York state show that the number of private
buses registered to do business in the city rose more than 20
percent in 1997, the most recent available figures, to 7,053. That
followed a decade of tiny annual increases. Before that, the number
of buses had actually been in decline for more than a decade, as
automobile traffic swelled.
</P>
<P>
   State records also show that the number of buses registered by
private operators, combined with those of New York City Transit and
those owned by the city and leased, had climbed to 12,103 by the
end of last year, only 84 fewer than the 12,187 medallion cabs
licensed by the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``All classes of traffic are up, but the buses stand out,'' said
Joanne Crowley, deputy director of tunnels, bridges and terminals
for the Port Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The city's estimate of 626.6 million people riding its buses
this year compares with a low of 436 million in 1996, following 20
years of declines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have stemmed the tide, and it has been very good for us,''
said Lawrence G. Reuter, president of New York City Transit.
</P>
<P>
   But the new popularity of buses has alarmed environmentalists,
who say the heightened congestion created by more buses means more
emissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true that the most important environmental action people
can take is getting out of cars, but if that is being achieved
simply through an increase in buses, it may be a bad deal for
people breathing air at the bus stops,'' said Richard Kassel,
senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

   &UR; Goya Murals in Spain &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can you tell me how to get in touch with the Aula Dei
monastery in Spain? I recently learned that women may now view the
Goya murals there. _ Suzanne Ermalina, Bangor, Maine
</P>
<P>
   A. Two centuries after Goya painted seven scenes of the Virgin
for a Spanish church used by sequestered Carthusian monks, women
can now visit the artworks without special permission from the
Pope.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1774, when the seven murals were painted, only three women
had seen them, including a Spanish princess. But on Nov. 11, when
Queen Sofia led a contingent of 50 women on an unprecedented visit
to the paintings in the 16th-century Aula Dei monastery near the
northern city of Zaragoza. They entered the church through a new
tunnel that authorities built under the monastery so the 30 monks
currently there would not be in contact with visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Women _ and men _ now use it to take the new, free 30-minute
guided tours on Saturdays from 9 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Visitors emerge
from the tunnel directly into the single-nave church, with its Goya
paintings that include a scene depicting the birth of the Virgin.
The monastery is seven miles north of Zaragoza near the village of
Penaflor and is served by Zaragoza bus line 28, which can be
boarded in the city's central Plaza Aragon.
</P>
<P>
   Visits are by appointment only and, because of heavy demand,
should be booked at least three months in advance, by fax (34)
976-714-808. The telephone number for reservations, (34)
976-714-934, is frequently busy and has a staff on hand only in the
mornings.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Antarctica and Beyond &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can you help us find a tour that combines a visit to the
Falkland Islands and Antarctica? We're planning the trip for next
fall or winter. _ Donald L. Weisberg, Washington
</P>
<P>
   A. If you're willing to throw in a few other stops, including
South Georgia _ a 1,450-square-mile island east of the Falklands
that is teeming with king penguins and wandering albatrosses _
there are at least two possibilities. Those taking the tours should
be physically fit and able to hike moderate distances over rough
terrain. They also should be prepared to spend a lot of money _
travel to Antarctica is one of the most expensive trips one can
take.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Audubon Society's 23-day tour to the
Falklands, South Georgia and Antarctica departs from Miami on Nov.
10. After a night in Santiago, participants embark on the 330-foot
Clipper Adventurer, which is equipped with a fleet of Zodiac
landing craft that will take them to no end of remote and icy
animal habitats. The first stop is Port Stanley in the Falkland
Islands, followed by visits to Carcass Island, home to elephant
seals, gentoo penguin colonies and black-crowned night herons. They
will also visit Westpoint Island and New Island, before cruising
about 800 miles to South Georgia to explore coves, bays and small
islands in search of fur seals, penguins and various marine
mammals.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the trip, experts in ornithology and marine biology
will be giving lectures about the wildlife and ecology of the
region. On Antarctica itself, one can visit scientific research
stations on the main peninsula, cruise down narrow channels rimmed
with towering icebergs and, weather permitting, make landfall on
adjacent islands, including Paulet Island, home to large
concentrations of Adelie penguins. Back in South America,
participants will stop at Ushuaia in the Argentine Tierra del Fuego
and spend one night in Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the trip starts at $8,360, excluding air fare from
Miami. Information: (800) 289-9504 extension 7411, fax (781)
259-1040.
</P>
<P>
   Natural Habitat Adventures, based in Boulder, Colo., is offering
a similar itinerary. The 21-day tour departs on Dec. 17, and by New
Year's Eve, you'll be in the Antarctic (a midnight celebration
involving Champagne toasts to icebergs is planned). Among the stops
the 285-foot World Discoverer will make are Santiago, Port Stanley,
Gleaker Island, Sea Lion Island, South Georgia, Stromness Bay,
South Orkney Islands (home to Adelie, chinstrap, gentoo and
macaroni penguins), Elephant Island, Antarctic research stations,
Port Lockroy on the Neumeyer Channel and Ushuaia. The cost of the
tour starts at $11,490, excluding air fare. Information: (800)
543-8917.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Diana Tours &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'd like to visit places in London connected to the Princess
of Wales' life? Are there any tours you can suggest? _ Deborah M.
Schoster, Miami Beach
</P>
<P>
   A. Since Diana's death in August 1997, there has been, according
to a spokesman for the London Tourist Board, a big demand from
overseas visitors for the kind of tour you're asking about.
</P>
<P>
   Currently the 35-year-old Original London Walks, is the only
company leading Diana tours that has been endorsed by the London
Tourist Board. It offers two itineraries. Both are two-hour
excursions beginning at 2 p.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and both
cost about $8.
</P>
<P>
   The Tuesday tour sets off from Exit 3 of the Hyde Park Corner
Underground Station and involves travel by subway, so participants
need a two-zone Travelcard, which costs $6.50 and is available at
any subway station. Among the places participants visit are the
Earls Court apartment in which Princess Diana lived before her
marriage to Prince Charles, and her favorite shopping and dining
haunts in Knightsbridge, including the Harvey Nichols department
store, Harrods, owned by Emad (Dodi) al-Fayed's Father, Mohamed
al-Fayed, and San Lorenzo a restaurant in Beauchamp Place.
Kensington Palace, the royal home of the princess, is also on this
tour.
</P>
<P>
   The Thursday walk starts from the Green Park subway station at
the Ritz exit and visits St. James' Palace, the London home of
Prince Charles; Clarence House, the home of Queen Elizabeth;
Spencer House, the ancestral home of Diana, as well as Buckingham
Palace. The tour passes by a number of clubs and night spots,
including White's Club (Prince Charles is a member), Tramps and
Annabel's, where Diana and Sarah Ferguson, the duchess of York,
occasionally enjoyed an evening out. Such shops as Asprey's, where
Diana and other members of the royal family shopped for presents,
is also on the route.
</P>
<P>
   For reservations, call Original London Walks at (44-171) 624
3978. The fax is (171) 625 1932.

PENGUINS GET THE MOST FOR THEIR MONEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh Penguins will start their rebuilding program any
decade now.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, a superstar retires from the Penguins, or a star
departs for a better-financed team. And each year, the Penguins
continue to put a competitive team on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1996-97 season, Mario Lemieux quit, and the Penguins
responded with a 40-24-18 record in 1997-98. Before this season,
veteran center Ron Francis grabbed a free-agent jackpot in
Carolina, but the Penguins keep ticking along, bankrupt off the ice
but a cohesive unit on it.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the ongoing success of the Penguins _ who play host
to the Kings tonight _ is that in recent seasons they've
successfully scoured the minors and found contributing players who
were hungry enough to do whatever was asked of them so they could
make it back to the NHL and remain there.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the most important people in the Penguins' universe are
not leading scorer Jaromir Jagr and No.1 goalie Tom Barrasso, but
general manager Craig Patrick and coach Kevin Constantine.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Constantine) looks for a player who is willing to change or
willing to do what he wants them to do,'' said Panthers winger Alex
Hicks, who played for the Penguins last season. ``He kind of holds
a trump card by saying, `If you want to come up here (from the
minors), I'll bring you here, and if you do what I tell you to do,
you'll stay here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Penguins have gotten significant contributions at
relatively insignificant prices the last couple of years from such
long-time minor-leaguers as winger Rob Brown ($450,000), defenseman
Brad Werenka ($550,000) and center Robert Lang ($500,000), who at
one point in his career was projected to be a future star for the
Kings.
</P>
<P>
   As for Brown, he once was a 49-goal scorer for the Penguins, but
from 1992-93 to 1996-97, he played only 18 games in the NHL. Brown
has returned to the NHL in this incarnation as a responsible
defensive player.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Constantine) brought (Brown) in, and after a few games of
letting him do what he wanted to do, he told Robbie, `This is the
role we want you to play,' '' Hicks said. ``It was a
take-it-or-leave-it kind of thing. Robbie really embraced it.
That's Kevin's mentality. He wants guys to come in and represent a
certain piece of the puzzle, and they're willing to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Or else.
</P>
<P>
   Lotto fever: One thousand tickets for Toronto's last game at
67-year-old Maple Leaf Gardens on Feb. 13 against Chicago will be
made available in a worldwide lottery. The idea is to foil scalpers
hoping to cash in on the historic closing of hockey's last
remaining grand old building.
</P>
<P>
   The Leafs are expected to advertise the procedure for the
lottery by the end of the calendar year. Winners won't get the
tickets for free but will win the opportunity to purchase the
tickets at their face value of $26.50 Canadian (about $18 U.S.).
The lottery winners who must travel the greatest distance to attend
the game will have their airfare and lodging paid for by the Leafs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't guarantee (scalpers) won't still get the seats, but
it will be harder,'' Toronto general manager Ken Dryden said. ``Now
a fan in Red Deer, Alberta, will have a fair chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the planned events to mark the move from the Gardens to
the new Air Canada Centre will be a parade on Feb. 19 to transfer
Stanley Cup banners. The motorcade through the streets of Toronto
will include the Zambonis.
</P>
<P>
   Garden memories: Before playing his final game in the Gardens
last week, New York Rangers center Wayne Gretzky said his finest
performance ever took place in Toronto the night the Kings
eliminated the Maple Leafs in the seventh game of their memorable
1993 playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation and the circumstances were, obviously, we were
an underdog,'' Gretzky said. ``We were playing on the road. We were
playing against not only a team and a city but maybe a country
(because) at that time Montreal had already advanced to the finals.
And all of Canada, rightfully, was pulling for a Montreal-Toronto
final.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, a Ontario native, spoiled the night for his province
and country, recording a hat trick in a dramatic 5-4 victory by the
Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Smart move: The Nashville Predators moved up the starting time
of their Jan. 4 home game against the Mighty Ducks to avoid a
conflict with Tennessee's national championship football game
against Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to create a situation where our fans had to
decide to watch the Predators and Ducks or UT go for the
championship,'' Predators president Jack Diller said.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: He didn't want an empty arena that night.

   &UR; Santiago de Compostela Primps for Pilgrims &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Way of St. James (in Spanish, Camino de Santiago) will
celebrate a Holy Year in 1999, and Spain has been sprucing up the
hundreds of miles of pilgrims' routes used since medieval times to
reach Santiago de Compostela, the northwestern city believed to
contain relics of St. James the Apostle.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Holy Year in Santiago occurs about every six years, when St.
James' Day, July 25, falls on a Sunday. The last time was in 1993,
and 1.3 million pilgrims (about twice as many as in other years)
traveled all or part of the 496-mile French Road, the most popular
route, through northern Spanish villages and countryside, to
Santiago, where they flock to the huge medieval cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   The cathedral's ornate front facade and main altar have been
cleaned for the Holy Year. Government agencies opened 17 new
hostels in 1993 along the French Road, and for 1999 they plan to
open 50 more along two popular secondary routes to Santiago, the
Northern Route and the Portuguese Road, each about 465 miles long.
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrims walk on average about 16 miles of the route daily,
staying in the hostels, which have only group accommodations, or in
hotels.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The government will use part of the $62 million Holy Year budget
to rehabilitate churches and monuments along the routes, and to put
up better signposts. Hundreds of exhibitions and concerts are
planned for next year along the Way of St. James. Among the largest
will be the ``Santiago'' exposition, starting in May at four places
simultaneously in Santiago de Compostela, and focusing on the
influence of the Way of St. James in European thought.
</P>
<P>
   Information about the Holy Year 1999 (or Xacobeo) is available
on the Internet at www.xacobeo.es or by telephone, (34-981) 541-999
or fax (34-981) 544-870.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Betting on Trips Around New Zealand  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand offers the Best of New Zealand pass, which provides
unlimited travel at a discount for six months on the country's
trains, ferries and buses, including eight long-distance trains.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The passes come in denominations of 600 points, 800 points and
1,000 points at prices ranging from $210 to $330. The rates are 30
to 34 percent below standard fares, assuming that the full amount
of the pass is used. Just how good a bargain the pass is depends on
the traveler's applying so-called Best Points to each trip taken.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a four-and-a-half-hour trip across the South Island
through the Southern Alps between Christchurch and Greymouth aboard
the TranzAlpine uses up 76 points, and an 11-hour trip between
Auckland and Wellington on the North Island requires 135 points. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Should the traveler misjudge the initial purchase, blocks of 100
or 200 extra points can be bought for $35 for each 100 points.
Except for not exceeding the number of points purchased, there are
no other restrictions. The pass may be used on any day during the
six-month period. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two unusual trains, the historic Taieri Gorge excursion train
near Dunedin on the South Island and a steam train, the Kingston
Flier, near Queenstown, also on the South Island, are available to
pass holders, as are discounts at various hotels, resorts and
tourist attractions and on activities like diving trips and
rafting. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the Best of New Zealand pass is available
from Austravel, New York, (800) 633-3404; Swain Australia Tours,
Ardmore, Pa., (800) 227-9246; Newmans South Pacific Vacations, Los
Angeles, (800) 421-3326; and ATS Tours, El Segundo, Calif., (310)
643-0044.

<P>
   &UR; Swiss Winemakers Prepare to Party  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Fete des Vignerons, a major wine festival, will be held in
Vevey, Switzerland, next summer from July 29 through Aug. 15. The
event has taken place only four or five times each century since
1783; the last was in 1977. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than 450,000 visitors are expected at the celebration in
Vevey, a town of 70,000 near the eastern end of Lake Geneva. The
festival is being organized by the Confrerie des Vignerons, a trade
guild formed in the 17th century to promote the wine industry in
Lavaux and Chablais, two wine regions that stretch along Lake
Geneva from Lausanne east to the Rhone River. In preparation for
the festival the guild will build a 16,000-seat arena in Vevey's
Market Square that looks across the lake to the snowcapped French
Alps. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The main event will be a performance in which more than 4,600
actors, singers and artists _ mostly townspeople _ present the
myths, folklore and modern aspects of winemaking. An original score
will be played live by the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande and by
the the Orchestre de Chambre de Lausanne. Following each of the
seven daytime performances (Aug. 4, 5, 9 to 12 and 15) and seven
evening performances (July 30 and 31 and Aug. 2, 5 to 7, and 13), a
town fair with theatrical vignettes, music, food and dancing will
take place throughout Vevey.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for the pageant run from $48 to $190, and the town fair
is free. Tickets for the pageant's two dress rehearsals cost $26 to
$62.50. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The festival will also feature parades through Vevey's Old Town
(July 29 and Aug. 1, 8, 14) and a show on July 29 at which the
region's best vintners are crowned.
</P>
<P>
   Parade tickets are $11 to $26; children under 14 are free.
Admission to the July 29 show is $37 to $110. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For information about festival tickets, hotels and packages,
contact the Vevey Tourist Office, Post Office Box 27, 1800 Vevey,
Switzerland; telephone (41-21) 922-2020, fax (41-21) 922-2024.

   &UR; The Euro Is Poised to Burst Onto Europe &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Europeans are holding their breath for the introduction of the
eurodollar, which will become the new single currency on Jan. 1.
But they are not sure how it will work or affect their lives. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The euro will become the official currency of the 11
participating countries _ France, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Ireland, Austria, Portugal, Spain, Italy and Finland _
although not in the form of cash. National currencies will still
exist alongside the euro, which can be used in noncash
transactions, such as credit card payments, checks and direct
debits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1, 2002, euro notes and coins &QL; 
will be introduced and all prices will be posted in euros. National
currencies will gradually be withdrawn and will cease to be legal
tender by June 30, 2002, at the latest.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Travelers are already seeing prices posted in euros and national
currencies. But they will not be obliged to pay in euros _ nor will
merchants be obliged to accept euros _ during the three-year
transition period. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People are worried and confused. A recent government poll in
France showed that 53 percent of the public is concerned about the
euro. American Express reports a ``lack of awareness and
readiness'' in a survey of 400 business travelers in Britain,
Germany, France, Sweden, Spain and the Netherlands. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the bright side, the euro will make prices much more
``transparent'' and therefore more competitive _ and easier for
international shoppers to compare _ across borders.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   American Express has announced it is inaugurating travelers
checks in euros. Visa International and Thomas Cook have already
said that their checks will be available from Jan. 1.

MILLENNIUM PARTY IS TOO GRAND TO MISS 
(FOR RELEASE SUN., DEC. 27) 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By JON NORDHEIMER     c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The mystical pull of changing millenniums is sparking a
wanderlust to the far ends of the planet to mark the moment at
midnight on Dec. 31, 1999, when either the 21st century dawns or
the last year of the 20th century begins a 366-day slide into 2001,
which purists argue is the real start of the third millennium.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a mad dash to book cabins on cruise ships, almost
any cruise ship as long as it parks under a starry sky on a warm
sea at the appointed time and date, preferably straddling the
international date line in the Pacific Ocean to let passengers
celebrate two New Year's Eves a day. For those with $44,950, that
amount will buy a seat on a private long-range jet carrying 88
travelers to witness several hours of Jan. 1, 2000, on the ground
on the western side of the international date line in Tonga, one of
the first countries to see in the new year. The group will then fly
east across the date line to Samoa, where the final minutes of 1999
will be counted down at midnight. (The jet, chartered by TCS
Expeditions of Seattle, then continues on a 24-day globe-circling
excursion.)
</P>
<P>
   TCS says the round-the-world flight has been fully booked and is
wait-listed, but space is available on the Great Builders tour,
which will visit Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar, India, Egypt and
Jordan before reaching Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   A group in Johannesburg is trying to get enough passengers to
fill a jumbo jet at $7,950 a seat and fly around the southern
hemisphere between Dec. 30, 1999, and Jan. 4, 2000, in the company
of an orchestra. Heinz F.Rosner, one of the organizers, said the
plan is to fly from South Africa to South America to join New
Year's Eve celebrations at stopovers in Buenos Aires and Santiago,
Chile, before experiencing multiple millennium moments on a
midnight flight to Tahiti, due to four time zone changes. Then it's
on to Auckland, Sydney and Mauritius in the Indian Ocean, arriving
back in Cape Town and Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   Most charter sailing vessels and motor yachts in the Virgin
Islands and elsewhere in the Caribbean are booked for the
millennium week, often at two to three times the holiday rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had bookings for more than a year now, and people are
going nuts in terms of the prices they're willing to pay,'' said
Tom Rowe, a co-owner of Newport Yacht Services of Newport, R.I., a
broker for a fleet of luxury boats for hire.
</P>
<P>
   Rowe offered as an example a 76-foot sport boat with four double
staterooms that normally costs $18,750 a week, including food and
drink. ``She's booked for millennium week at $54,500,'' he said,
adding mischievously, ``the more modest gougers are asking only
twice their usual rates.''
</P>
<P>
   The international date line, a manmade contrivance that snakes
along the 180th meridian in mid-Pacific Ocean with a zig here and a
zag there to avoid splitting nations into different calendar days,
falls just to the east of New Zealand. At Gisborne, N.Z., clinging
to the northeasternmost point of land, millennium events over
several days will range from a tall ships visit to a Maori music
festival and the first triathlon of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Two time zones behind, Sydney, Australia, will host a 24-hour
New Year's party which, for Australians, may be just like another
Friday night at the pub.
</P>
<P>
   Tonga, a group of 171 islands with a population of 97,000
situated about 1,000 miles north-northeast of New Zealand, will be
more intensely affected. Some 10,000 or more visitors aboard cruise
ships and chartered flights are expected to join another 3,000
overseas Tongans coming home for the New Year's party, according to
Amelia Tupou, spokeswoman with the Tonga Visitors Bureau. Nearly
all 700 hotel and resort rooms have been booked, she said; home
stays are being arranged, and those arriving without reservations
may have to camp out.
</P>
<P>
   In central India, there will be a millennium observance at the
1,000-year-old stone temples at Khajuraho, scene of an annual dance
festival. Twenty-two of the original 85 soaring shrines
commissioned by Chandal Rajput kings still stand.
</P>
<P>
   Special New Year's Eve tours will ponder the key mystery of the
floodlighted temples: Do the groupings of men and women captured in
carnal play portray the emptiness of human passion or _ as some
scholars believe _ teach that gratification of earthly desires is a
step closer to enlightenment?
</P>
<P>
   Those seeking more formal surroundings are headed for fancy
dress balls in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hottest tickets is for the Bath Ball in England, a
black-tie event held every New Year's Eve and limited to 1,300
revelers inside the Bath Pavilion. But the millennium ball has been
relocated to a giant multipeaked concert tent on the central
recreation grounds near the city's famous Roman baths, and the
number has swelled to 8,000. In a country where privilege still
counts, 1,000 guests will get to look down on the others from a
raised platform where the extra cost of a ticket will include
champagne and canapes.
</P>
<P>
   In Vienna, partygoers at the Imperial Ball will be able to waltz
into the new millennium inside the state rooms of the Hofburg
Palace with music provided by members of the Vienna State Opera and
the Volks-oper. Tickets start at around $170 for the event, which
is almost sold out. Hopefuls can try contacting the Hofburg
Congress Center directly or tour companies in the United States
that have packages.
</P>
<P>
   One offbeat celebration is being planned at the Four Seasons
Hotel in London. The entire hotel near Hyde Park will have an ocean
liner theme and 350 tickets sold to a millennium cruise party, a
two-night package going for $3,380 a couple.
</P>
<P>
   A ninth-floor suite will have its windows blacked out and
soundproofed, clocks and calendars removed, and the guests can
order from a menu dating to the first half of the century while
watching a selection of black and white movies. (The suite will be
auctioned at the highest bid received by June 1, 1999, with a
minimum of $1,606 for lodging only, plus 17.5 percent V.A.T.)
</P>
<P>
   If this is too tame, Abercrombie &AMP; Kent International is
offering a wide selection of high-end millennium tours and cruises
to every continent for nearly every taste, whether voyages to
Antarctica, safaris in Africa or serendipitous tours of Indochina.
</P>
<P>
   For less money and more exercise, Vermont-based Country Walkers
has millennium walking tours in seven countries.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Brown, a 47-year-old retired wildlife biologist from
Little Rock, Ark., has signed up for the hike to the ruins at Machu
Picchu in Peru. She said she was inspired by an interest in the
medicinal uses of plants and by reports that alien space ships may
land there at the dawn of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows?'' Ms. Brown mused at this possibility. In any case,
it will be less crowded than Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   If only the real Paris will do, a walk down the Champs-Elysees
on New Year's Eve 1999 is envisioned as a dreamlike passage through
a series of giant gates created by a dozen artists. From the Porte
Maillot to the Place de la Concorde, including the Arc de Triomphe,
the proposed gates would represent a symbolic crossing into the new
millennium.

ANALYST RECOMMENDS CALIFORNIA SPEND MORE ON INFRASTRUCTURE, LESS ON
SCHOOLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Also moving in the ``n'' California news file) 
By TERRI HARDY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The state Legislature should reconsider its
practice of providing billions to build new schools, and instead
put more of its money into repairing California's crumbling
highways, universities and other facilities, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A report released Monday by the nonpartisan Legislative
Analyst's Office found that a larger portion of the state's general
fund is spent on debt repayment for school districts' facilities
than on the state's Public Works projects.
</P>
<P>
   For the state to maintain its own buildings and roads, it needs
to rethink its priorities and boost spending for such projects from
0.3 percent of the general fund to 6 percent, the report's author
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to recognize that the state has responsibility for its
own facilities,'' state analyst Chuck Nicol said in an interview.
``It needs to be determined to what extent we participate in
funding local needs, like schools, and whether it's affordable from
a state perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Other officials, however, say cutting state expenditures for
schools may not be greeted favorably by lawmakers who are aware of
polls showing education is a top concern of voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state shouldn't back away from funding new schools. There
is a huge need that has been underfunded for years,'' said
Assemblywoman Kerry Mazzoni, D-San Rafael, chairwoman of the
Assembly Education Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hauck, president of the nonprofit statewide advisory group
California Business Roundtable, agreed, saying that while it might
not be an ideal situation, schools have become dependent upon the
state for construction funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until that changes, the state must play a significant role,''
Hauck said. ``I don't see how the state can walk away at this
point.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's annual debt payment for schools will increase from
$850 million to $1.2 billion over the next five years, comprising
1.6 percent of the general fund. Even after the expenditure of $6.7
billion in bond money that voters approved in November, California
schools will continue to have a ``multibillion-dollar need'' for
new construction and renovation, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the report says, the state must spend tens of
billions of dollars over the next decade fixing its aging highway
system, universities, hospitals, parks and libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the state will need to funnel billions more into Public
Works projects to handle expected growth, as the state's population
is projected to nearly double by the year 2040.
</P>
<P>
   Nicol said it will be up to Gov.-elect Gray Davis and the
Legislature to establish priorities.
</P>
<P>
   The report finds that the state has no master plan for
determining its building and renovation needs, and has no
well-defined budgeting process for financing them. The report
recommends an overhaul by establishing a legislative committee
devoted to overseeing development and financing of projects.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzoni said it is crucial that a planning process be set into
place and agreed that it is prudent to set aside 6 percent of the
general fund for Public Works projects. To allow school districts
to raise more money themselves, she is proposing a constitutional
amendment to lower the school-bond vote requirement from two-thirds
to a simple majority.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the California Business Roundtable issued a report
that came to the same general conclusion as the Legislative
Analyst's Office _ the state had no capital facilities plan and no
rational way to fund them. The group recommended setting aside a
quarter-cent of existing sales tax revenues over the next 10 years
to pay for $90 billion in expected Public Works needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to meet the needs of a growing population _ if we
don't, it threatens our economic growth,'' Hauck said. ``The state
can no longer plan or fund these projects in a willy-nilly, ad hoc
basis.''

CORKUM RISING TO TOP OF NHL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the exception of Teemu Selanne, who scored a rookie-record
76 goals six years ago to win the Calder Trophy, no Coyotes player
has captured any of the NHL's major postseason awards in the club's
19-year history.
</P>
<P>
   That could change this season. A handful of Phoenix players seem
to be in contention for hockey hardware, perhaps none more so than
center Bob Corkum, whose name is making the rounds as a leading
candidate for the Frank J. Selke Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Hockey News'' recently tabbed Corkum as the second-best
pick for the Selke, given annually to the league's best defensive
forward, when it handicapped awards at the first-quarter pole of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Corkum, whom the magazine rated behind 1997 winner and '98
runner-up Michael Peca from Buffalo, has heard the talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, the Selke? Nah,'' Corkum said, modestly shrugging off his
chances. ``People are talking about it, and it's nice, and I'm very
proud to get mentioned in this same breath as that. But I tell you,
coming off a couple games in Toronto and St. Louis, the way I
played out there last week, if there was a Sucky Trophy, I'd
probably be a leading candidate for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were probably two of the worst games I've ever played in
the National Hockey League. I was downright embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes lost both of those games, their first losing streak
of the season, but they quickly rebounded with an impressive 4-2
win Sunday over the visiting New York Islanders. Up next is marquee
match-up with the Detroit Red Wings (17-12-1) tonight at Joe Louis
Arena, where Corkum's play will be pivotal for Phoenix (18-5-4).
</P>
<P>
   The two-time defending Stanley Cup champions are one of the few
teams that effectively roll out four forward lines, and they
feature three of the game's biggest offensive threats in Steve
Yzerman, Brendan Shanahan and Sergei Fedorov. Corkum's mission:
Shut them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get up for a game like this,'' Corkum said.
``Obviously, they're a top-echelon team, and if you go in there
mentally or physically unprepared, it's going to be a long night.
To compete with those guys, you have to be rarin' and ready to go.
You have to get great goaltending to beat them, and your special
teams have to be solid.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't get much easier Wednesday night in Chicago, where
Corkum will have to contend with the likes of Tony Amonte, Doug
Gilmour and suddenly hot Alexei Zhamnov.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they had a rough start, but they've been playing a lot
better as of late and they're moving up the ladder,'' Corkum said.
``Both of these teams are extremely dangerous if you give them any
room at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Corkum usually gives opposing forwards about as much room as two
hippos in a phone booth. He's even more suffocating as the catalyst
on the league's No. 1-ranked penalty-killing unit, which has
allowed only 11 goals on 125 opportunities (91.2 percent).
</P>
<P>
   As for faceoffs, Corkum is one of the NHL's best on the draw.
He's won 293 in 27 games _ an ``average'' of 10.9.
</P>
<P>
   Put it all together _ the defense, the penalty killing, the
faceoffs _ and Corkum possesses the key ingredients needed to be in
the race for the Selke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely. He definitely is a candidate. No question,''
Coyotes captain Keith Tkachuk said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree,'' teammate Mike Sullivan said. ``I think it would be
terrific for him. Corky's a guy that's been a big part of the
Coyotes' success this year, and I think it would be a great reward
for his work ethic and his contribution to the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jim Schoenfeld said Corkum is every bit as worthy as
leading contenders Peca; Dallas' Jere Lehtinen, last year's winner;
and Craig Conroy of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know how important he is to our team, what a fine hockey
player he is,'' Schoenfeld said. ``If other people don't see them
enough to recognize it, well, that's the way it is in the NHL. But
make no mistake about it, he's an extremely valuable player for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   He will become more valuable this summer when he becomes an
unrestricted free agent for the first time. The Coyotes signed him
to a one-year deal this fall, but several teams no doubt will line
up with offers to more than double his $675,000 salary. &QL;

DOLPHINS DEFEAT BRONCOS, 31-21 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

<P>
   MIAMI _ Striking a balance between the run and the pass was
Miami's mantra for this season. The Dolphins decided they would
sink or swim on their running game. Their head coach, Jimmy
Johnson, said he had seen enough of Dan Marino throwing, throwing
and throwing some more and Miami unable to run that ball. So, it
was run or bust.
</P>
<P>
   Nice theory. Nice plan. But on Monday night, it was bust.
</P>
<P>
   Marino and an eager group of Dolphins receivers did it, notably
Lamar Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins turned a 13-7 Denver halftime lead into a
second-half exhibition of fancy passes and nifty catches. Marino
was maddening (23 of 38 for 355 yards with 4 touchdown passes and 1
interception), Thomas was explosive (3 touchdown catches, 136
receiving yards) and Miami surprised Denver, 31-21, before 74,363
fans at Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins (10-5) earned a wild-card playoff berth, completing
the American Football Conference post-season picture.
</P>
<P>
   Denver (13-2) looks troubled. It clawed for a 35-31 victory over
Kansas City at home, fell by 20-16 at the New York Giants last week
and then collapsed here under the pressure of Marino's arm and a
defense that intercepted Broncos quarterback John Elway twice. By
contrast, how sharp was Miami?
</P>
<P>
   In the matchup of marquee quarterbacks, Elway was no match for
Marino. Elway looked bad (13 of 36 for 151 yards with no touchdowns
and 2 interceptions) and was intercepted the second time with 3
minutes 17 seconds remaining and Denver set for one of his
spectacular game-winning drives. Dolphins cornerback Jerry Wilson
ruined that, taking an Elway pass that tight end Shannon Sharpe had
his hands on and wrestling it away, to end Denver's final hopes.
Miami converted that into an Olindo Mare 42-yard field goal with
1:10 left that provided the game's final points.
</P>
<P>
   Marino to Thomas for a 56-yard touchdown with 10:26 left in the
third quarter gave Miami a 14-13 lead. Marino to Thomas again for a
17-yard score with 5:53 left in the quarter made it 21-13. And then
with 8:15 left to play, Marino found a new scoring partner,
receiver Oronde Gadsden, for an 8-yard score. Miami ahead, 28-13.
</P>
<P>
   Denver scored on the ensuing kickoff, a 95-yard return by Vaughn
Hebron, the Broncos' first kickoff return for a score since 1972.
That was it for Denver. Miami put this game away with those three
Marino strikes in the second half and with Wilson's first-ever
career theft. Too much for Denver to overcome, especially with
Elway ineffective and with star running back Terrell Davis limited
to 16 carries for 29 rushing yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our guys did a great job, every one of them,''
Johnson said. ``I told our team in the meeting last night that to
beat a great team like Denver that we needed contributions from
everyone on our roster. Dan played one of his best games since I've
been here. It was obviously big _ it got us into the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver took control in the first half with Miami's help. The
Dolphins' Olindo Mare missed a 28-yard field goal in the first
quarter after Denver's Jason Elam had kicked a 52-yard field goal.
And then early in the second quarter, the Miami defense, on an odd
play, forced a fumble that resulted in a Denver touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   In the final seconds of the half, after both teams had struggled
on offense, the game became much more loose. It was a hint of what
was to come in the second half, when both teams began to pass at
will.
</P>
<P>
   With 54 seconds left before halftime, Miami scored on a 9-yard
pass from Marino to Thomas, making the score 10-7. But Denver moved
43 yards for another field goal as time expired for a 13-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Denver and Miami are not familiar opponents. They have met only
eight times, the last time before Monday night coming in 1985.
Their last meeting in Miami was 23 years ago. But Miami fans
probably know that the Dolphins' first victory _ a 24-7 game on
Oct. 16, 1966, in the Orange Bowl _ was against the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Miami had won the last four games in this series played here,
and to keep that trend intact, the Dolphins understood at halftime
that they would have to make more of their chances on offense. They
would have to either run the ball with better production or simply
put the game in Marino's hands to have any chance to win. The
Dolphins gained no rushing first downs in the half and were 2 of 7
(29 percent) in third-down efficiency. The Dolphins ran the ball 11
times and gained 12 yards. Without Marino's arm (10 of 19 for 168
yards in the half) and the receivers' catches, Miami would have
been out of the game early.
</P>
<P>
   The defense helped keep Miami close in the first half. It
limited Terrell Davis to 26 rushing yards and the Denver rushing
attack to 49. It held Elway to 90 yards passing.
</P>
<P>
   On its first possession, Denver traveled 46 yards for Elam's
long field goal. The long plays were Elway's completions of 12
yards to the Pro Bowl receiver Ed McCaffrey and 15 yards to the pro
bowl tight end Shannon Sharpe. Miami, on its next possession, drove
to the Denver 10, but Mare missed his short field-goal attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Denver made it 10-0 with 7:56 left before halftime on an Elway
scramble from the Miami 9 to the 4 that wound up a touchdown. At
the 4, Dolphins end Jason Taylor knocked the ball into the Miami
end zone. Denver receiver Rod Smith was waiting to dive and craddle
the ball for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   That was a bad break for Miami. But with 1:49 left before the
half, the Dolphins showed that they could move the ball on offense
and strike quickly. Marino's 29-yard pass to receiver Nate Jacquet
put the ball at the Denver 21. After a 12-yard toss to fullback
Stanley Pritchett, Marino threw a line drive into the left corner
of the end zone that Thomas caught over Denver cornerback Tito
Paul.
</P>
<P>
   Elway bounced back in the final 54 seconds with a 21-yard pass
to McCaffrey. McCaffrey showed great courage on the play, catching
and holding the ball after being belted by safety Brock Marion. And
Elam converted on a 44-yarder to give Denver a 13-7 lead at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Elam, however, started the second half by missing a 43-yard
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   It might have been a sign that this game would be won with big
plays in the second half. &QL;

CARDINALS ARE ALONG FOR THE RIDE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   It sounded like an acceptance speech on Oscar night.
</P>
<P>
   Standing at a lectern, Jake Plummer smiled into the lights and
began going down the list of thank yous.
</P>
<P>
   He thanked the head coach and the assistant coaches and his
linemen and his receivers. He paused and looked offstage at the man
in the sober blue suit and bow tie, hands clasped in front of him,
like a wedding usher. ``Thank you, Mr. Bidwill, for drafting me.''
</P>
<P>
   He thanked his agent.
</P>
<P>
   He thanked his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   In the audience, two others whom he would introduce by name, sat
together, beaming. Though divorced, they share something you can't
put a price tag on _ the parental bond of unconditional love.
Marilyn Plummer took in her son's khaki pants and green sport
shirt. You almost could read her thoughts. ``He could have worn his
suit.``
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1996 Heisman Trophy ceremony in New York, she
insisted Jake buy one. ``Mom, I've`` got'' a sport coat,'' Plummer
protested.
</P>
<P>
   No, she told him. This was non-negotiable. ``You need a suit for
this.''
</P>
<P>
   So the ASU quarterback went to a department store and selected a
garment that satisfied his mom's requirements. I asked Jake what
label he was wearing. Armani? Brooks Brothers?
</P>
<P>
   ``I dunno,'' the kid said. ``The top matches the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer finished third in the Heisman voting, but he was the
headliner in Monday's big announcement. The Cardinals put their
money where their future is and extended Plummer's contract. The
numbers made you whistle _ almost $30 million over four seasons. A
record $15 million bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Plummer must have chuckled inside as he looked at the
24-year-old, a multimillionaire, and thought of his son's first
car.
</P>
<P>
   It was a yellow '68 Hornet, with a missing door, given to him by
a family friend. Jake didn't drive it long.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fell apart,'' Plummer said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Plummer's senior year in high school, father and son
strolled around a used car lot. A '74 Dodge Dart caught Jake's eye.
They kicked the tires, lifted the hood. Plummer's dad paid $1,100.
</P>
<P>
   The teenager affectionately named his vehicle the ``Green
Weenie,'' and while the interior was immaculate, the shock
absorbers were so worn that when he drove up to school and turned
the corner, the car swayed to one side, listing like a ship in a
working sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake never cared about what he drove,'' the elder Plummer
said.
</P>
<P>
   True, Jake?
</P>
<P>
   No. 16 grinned sheepishly. ``Heck, I didn't care. Rubber wheels
were better than rubber heels.''
</P>
<P>
   At ASU, Plummer had a Mazda with no air conditioning. He later
got a Jeep, which was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon in 1995, I offered him a lift from the ASU
practice field to Sun Devil Stadium. Jake folded his 6-foot-2 frame
into the passenger's seat of the Japanese two-seater. He was
wearing his grass-stained football pants.
</P>
<P>
   You OK? Knees under his chin, the unpretentious kid from Idaho
who later would lead ASU to an 11-0 season and now far outshines
the player who beat him out for the Heisman _ Danny Wuerffel is the
No. 3 Saints quarterback _ nodded, assuring he wasn't nearly as
uncomfortable as he appeared.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals did what they had to do, what they should do. Jake
Plummer is their transportation now. Car and driver.
</P>
<P>
   In his second NFL season, he has led his team to eight wins,
doubling last year's total.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a piece of the puzzle,'' he said. Yes, the most
important piece.
</P>
<P>
   Without him, the Cardinals wouldn't have come back and beaten
the Saints. They wouldn't be wouldn't be knocking on the playoff
door.
</P>
<P>
   What if the Cardinals hadn't drafted him? Perish the thought.
</P>
<P>
   Will fame and riches change him?
</P>
<P>
   Who knows.
</P>
<P>
   All we know for sure is that Jake Plummer can play and rally
those around him and win games. He can throw and he can run. The
top and bottom match.

EXCITEMENT DRIVES TICKET SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can it be? Can it possibly be that finally it's hip to wear red?
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, who with a win over San Diego on Sunday would
secure their first playoff berth since moving to the Valley in
1988, experienced unprecedented action at the ticket office Monday
at their Tempe headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Fans were lined up at least 15 deep most of the day as nearly
7,000 tickets were sold. A team spokesman described it as ``the
most active day in the history of the team. The demand is
unprecedented.'' That stems more from the Cardinals playoff hopes
than from the club's announcement on Monday that it had extended
the contract of quarterback Jake Plummer for four years.
</P>
<P>
   Several ticket buyers in line Monday said the spectre of the
playoffs combined with the Cardinals' string of exciting finishes
have made their season finale a socially desirable and acceptable
place to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born and raised in San Francisco, a 49ers fan,'' said
Michele McDermott, 43, an Ahwatukee resident who had just purchased
her tickets. ``We have good friends here this weekend. We're
diehard football fans. We recognize the excitement the Cardinals
have generated, and we're ready for a blast.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed by Jack Liptrot, 58, of Sun Lakes, who
with his son, Nick, 23, who is visiting from Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
are looking for a good time watching pro football.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be my first game here, but I saw them in St.
Louis,'' said Liptrot, who has lived in the Valley for three years.
``I'm from Chicago, and my dad was a Cardinals fan. We hadn't even
heard the news about Jake, but that's great for him. We just
thought the Cardinals have been looking good, they've been
exciting, and we wanted to see a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Bowman, 41, of Phoenix, said he has been to a few
Cardinals games through the years but is pumped about the potential
for a playoff run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Larry Centers myself,'' Bowman said. ``I love the NFL.
It's exciting to me that the Cardinals control their destiny in
this last game. Everyone has been so down on them. I want to see
them do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the demand, the Cardinals on Monday announced
extension of ticket hours and increased ways of obtaining tickets.
The ticket office at their headquarters, located at the northeast
corner of Warner and Hardy in Tempe, will be open today through
Thursday from 8:30 a.m. until 8:30 p.m. Officials will gauge demand
through Thursday and determine whether to keep it open on Christmas
Day.
</P>
<P>
   Also, officials at Arizona State have permitted the Cardinals to
operate two ticket windows at the Sun Devil Stadium ticket office,
which will be open Tuesday through Thursday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, tickets may be purchased 24 hours a day at kiosks at
selected Safeway stores throughout the Valley. Locations may be
obtained on the Cardinals Web site, Azcardinals.com. Tickets also
may be ordered by phone at 1-888-ETMTIXS. Telephone orders may be
claimed at either ASU or the Cardinals facility. Team officials
encourage those who have will-call orders to pick them up before
game day to avoid long lines. &QL;

 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NFL's second-highest-paid player didn't want to sound
disrespectful, but he has some suggestions how Cardinals owner Bill
Bidwill can spend more of his money.
</P>
<P>
   And what quarterback Jake Plummer wants, he usually gets.
</P>
<P>
   If Plummer gets his wish, outside linebacker Jamir Miller and
wide
</P>
<P>
   receiver Rob Moore, both unrestricted free agents at the end of
the season, will be the next to sign new deals with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a piece of the puzzle,'' Plummer said.
</P>
<P>
   Make that a big piece.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals gave Plummer the biggest signing bonus in NFL
history ($15 million) in signing him to the biggest contract in
team history on Monday, a four-year extension worth $29.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   The previous largest signing bonus in league history was the
$12.99 million Dallas gave Deion Sanders. The previous biggest
signing bonus in Cardinals history was the $10.491 million given to
first-round pick Andre Wadsworth in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a Christmas present to our fans,'' Bidwill said.
</P>
<P>
   The fans gave a present back Monday by buying as many as 7,000
tickets for Sunday's game against the San Diego Chargers, the best
sales day the team has had in its 11 seasons in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the fans are counting on Plummer to beat the Chargers and
get the team in the playoffs for the first time since 1982. Then,
if he does that, all he has left to do in the off-season is help
the team get the new multipurpose, domed stadium it is seeking in
Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real opportunity for the people in the Valley to
take a look at the excitement of what a new stadium could bring
here and how competitive it would make the team,'' Plummer's agent,
Leigh Steinberg, said. ``I've negotiated with the Bidwills for 20
years, and I've never seen them more determined to bring a winner
to the Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long after announcing the deal, Bidwill said, ``Now, we can
get on to other player personnel matters as quickly as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer said the Cardinals (8-7) need to make sure the nucleus
of the team stays intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we've got to take care of,'' he said. ``Guys
like Jamir, he's a horse on defense. We've got to have him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rob (Moore), look at the production of our offense the past
few weeks. Look at the production he has had. We have to have him.
They (Cardinals officials) have to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   They won't come cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Ravens recently re-signed linebacker Ray Lewis to
a deal worth $6.5 million a year. Linebackers Mark Fields of New
Orleans and Ted Johnson of New England received new contracts worth
an average of $5.1 million and $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The top free agent wide receivers are expected to get more than
$4 million a year, which is what Tennessee gave Yancey Thigpen a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he remains hopeful he can reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to keep this young team together,'' Miller said. ``The
way to keep everyone together is to pay so everyone is happy and
wants to play here. I would hope they attempt to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals don't know whether they can keep both Miller and
Moore and stay under the 1999 salary cap, which is expected to be
$56 million to $57 million. They can protect themselves by slapping
the franchise designation on one of them, meaning they can match
any deal. But the player has to be paid the average of the top five
at his position.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer's new deal pays him salaries of $2 million next year, $3
million in 2000, $4 million in 2001 and $5.7 million in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have to ask for an upgrade on my Christmas
present,'' center Aaron Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   The signing bonus will be paid in two installments _ $11.25
million next year and the remaining $3.75 million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could buy my whole (home) town,'' said offensive guard
Chris Dishman, a native of tiny Cozad, Neb. ``He deserves it. He's
going to take the team a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   He will earn an average of $7.42 million a year, which,
according to Steinberg, puts him ``a few dollars'' from the NFL's
richest deal, the $7.5 million a year earned by San Francisco
quarterback Steve Young.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer signed his new contract just one day after leading the
Cardinals to his eighth comeback victory in 24 starts, a 19-17 win
over New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   By getting the deal done before the end of the regular season,
the Cardinals can count $3 million of Plummer's pro-rated signing
bonus against their 1998 salary cap, of which they still had $3
million available.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said Plummer, who was in the second year of a
three-year, $1.6 million deal, wasn't demanding a new contract.
``It wasn't a priority for us; the Cardinals were the ones
pushing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations between Steinberg and Bill Bidwill Jr., Cardinals
vice president, accelerated in the past few days, much to Plummer's
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 23 years old, making what I was making, I was very happy,''
Plummer said. ``Money has never been a big issue. I've never been
one to look at somebody else and think I should get more because I
thought I was better than him.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Plummer said he instructed Steinberg to keep him out of
the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at 1 a.m. Saturday, Steinberg decided he had to talk to
Plummer about the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to wake him up in the middle of the night, and he wasn't
pleased with me,'' Steinberg said. ``I called Jake and said,
`Please, can you listen one second.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `This is the most important night before a game,
Friday night, the one in which I get the most sleep.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake wouldn't listen. I tried to relate the details, he said,
`No, no, no. I have to focus on the game.' He's so oblivious to the
money side of things, I don't think if he was under sodium
pentothal, he could tell you all the details of the deal.''

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
MIAMI _ John Elway should be glad he plays Dan Marino only once
every 13 years.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The long-awaited confrontation between Elway and Marino, two of
the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history, was more lopsided than
President Clinton vs. the House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Marino badly outplay Elway on Monday Night
Football, but Miami shocked Denver 31-21 to clinch the last playoff
berth in the AFC.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins (10-5), who finish the season at Atlanta, are still
trying to host a wild-card playoff game. If Miami beats the Falcons
or New England loses to the Jets, the Dolphins will host a
first-round game.
</P>
<P>
   The once-invincible Broncos (13-2), who wrapped up the
home-field advantage in the AFC two weeks ago, lost their second
consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miami was ready and played for 60 minutes,'' Denver coach Mike
Shanahan said. ``We didn't, and that's why we got embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a great job stopping the run. No one has contained
our running game like that.''
</P>
<P>
   For only the second time in their 16-year careers, Elway and
Marino squared off. The first time was in 1985 when both were
playing in their third season. Marino threw three touchdown passes
in a 30-26 victory at Denver.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Marino was even better before 74,363 at Pro Player
Stadium. He threw four touchdown passes for the first time since
1995, and three went to backup wide receiver Lamar Thomas, who had
six catches for 136 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan was fantastic,'' Miami coach Jimmy Johnson said. ``That's
as good a game as I've seen him play. He got great protection, and
Lamar stepped up and made some big, big plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino finished 23-of-38 for 355 yards, with one interception.
Elway was 13-of-36 for 151 yards and no touchdowns, with two
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``John's a special player, the best quarterback I've ever
seen,'' Marino said. ``It was fun to play against him, but this
game wasn't important because John and I were playing. It was
important because we earned a spot in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told John after the game that I hoped to see him down the
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver scored only one offensive touchdown against a Miami
defense that has allowed the fewest points in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Denver running back Terrell Davis, the league's leading rusher,
was shut down by Miami's defense. He was limited to 29 yards on 16
carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We jumped all over him,'' Dolphins linebacker Robert Jones
said. ``We watched film and saw guys miss a lot of arm tackles. You
can arm-tackle Davis. You've got to swarm to him, hit him and wrap
him up. That's exactly what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, it was anticipated this game would be about the
Dolphins trying to deal the Broncos their first loss and protect
the 1972 Dolphins' record as the only unbeaten and untied NFL
champion. But when Denver was upset Dec. 13 by the Giants, Monday's
game lost some of its luster.
</P>
<P>
   After Jason Elam kicked a 52-yard field goal, the Broncos took
advantage of a fumble at midfield. They needed 10 plays to score.
On third-and-goal from the Miami nine, Elway couldn't find a
receiver and took off up the middle. At the five-yard line, the
ball slipped out of his hand and bounced into the end zone, where
receiver Rod Smith recovered for the touchdown. Elam boosted the
lead to 10-0 with the extra point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for that one drive, we played great defense,'' Johnson
said. ``I don't know if you can say enough good things about our
defense. We challenged them to excel against a great offense, and
they responded just the way we hoped.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami didn't score until its last drive of the first half, when
Marino lofted a fade pass into the right corner of the end zone.
Thomas outjumped reserve cornerback Tito Paul for the touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos had 54 seconds to work with at the end of the first
half, and they didn't waste the opportunity. Elway completed three
consecutive passes to Miami's 26, and Elam kicked a 44-yard field
goal as time expired, giving Denver a 13-7 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos began the second half where they left off in the
first, but they stalled when Elam missed a 43-yard field-goal
attempt. Elam's rare miss seemed to ignite the Dolphins' offense.
</P>
<P>
   Miami took the lead for good when Marino connected with Thomas
on a 56-yard touchdown and Olindo Mare's extra point put the
Dolphins up 14-13 with 10:26 left in the third quarter. Later in
the period, the Dolphins extended their lead to 21-13 when Marino
and Thomas hooked up for a 17-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   After each of his touchdowns, Thomas ran to the end zone and
handed the ball to family members. His grandmother, aunt and uncle
went home with early Christmas presents.
</P>
<P>
   Miami increased the lead after cornerback Sam Madison
intercepted an Elway pass for Smith and returned it 35 yards to the
Denver six. Three plays later, Marino fired an eight-yard touchdown
pass to Oronde Gadsden on a quick slant route. Mare made it 28-13
with 8:15 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos jumped right back into it when Vaughn Hebron
returned the kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown. It was Denver's
first kickoff return for a touchdown since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   On the two-point conversion, backup quarterback Bubby Brister
entered the game. He completed the two-point pass to Ed McCaffrey
to reduce Miami's lead to 28-21 with 7:57 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos got the ball back with plenty of time to score, but
Elway was the victim of two dropped passes. Then, he was
intercepted by reserve cornerback Jerry Wilson with 3:17 left.
</P>
<P>
   Mare completed the scoring for the Dolphins with a 42-yard field
goal with 1:10 remaining.

ASU'S DUBOIS MORE THAN CHEERLEADER 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-DUBOIS-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The temptation is to call it an early Christmas present for Ron
DuBois, but no one confuses ASU basketball Coach Rob Evans with
Santa Claus. The scholarship for next semester that's stuffed in
DuBois' stocking is no gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's earned it,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   DuBois, a senior point guard who walked on his sophomore year,
the first semester last year and again the first semester this
year, is nonetheless appreciative. His parents are putting two
other kids through college.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is huge for them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So now, DuBois has regained former walk-on status. Interim Coach
Don Newman last year rewarded DuBois with a scholarship for his
feisty, unceasing effort and positive attitude.
</P>
<P>
   But when Evans came in April, DuBois had to start over. Even his
place on the squad was not assured.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no guarantees of anything,'' Evans said. ``But I
had confidence in him. I tell the kids the first day, `You may not
have the ability some other guys have, but if you work hard, you'll
get an opportunity. And if you get an opportunity, you've got to
make the most of it.' And this kid's done it.''
</P>
<P>
   DuBois, who is from Lodi, Calif., is generously listed at 5 feet
10. He is among the smallest of the Sun Devils but is no novelty
act. Originally, DuBois' main job was to provide strong competition
in practice. Last season, when ASU had only eight recruited players
on scholarship, he, along with fellow walk-ons D'Angelo Jones and
Derek Smith, were invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   But DuBois has since expanded his role during games, evolving
from a cheerleader and clear-the-bench substitute to a smart,
steadying influence.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's wild, triple-overtime victory at Texas A&AMP;M, for
example, DuBois was at the controls in the second half when ASU
erased an 11-point deficit and took the lead. His line in the box
score _ 0-for-3 shooting, one assist, one steal in 11 minutes _
barely tells the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had given us a sense of urgency, a sense of fire,'' Evans
said. ``He was controlling the basketball and giving it to the
people who should get it. He had a sense of when to push it and
when to slow it down.''
</P>
<P>
   DuBois, who wants to be a coach when he graduates in the spring,
could have played in Division II after high school, ``but it's
every kid's dream to play big-time basketball,'' he said. ``I knew
my chances weren't good, but it was my dream.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was discouraged from walking on as a freshman, when Bill
Frieder was head coach. The next year, then-assistant George
McQuarn suggested he become a manager because managers were
sometimes needed for practice drills. DuBois did that, impressed
the staff and suited up. He got into four games.
</P>
<P>
   DuBois appeared in 15 games last year under Newman, averaging 2{
minutes a game. This season, he has played in all nine games and
averages 11 minutes. He had three three-point baskets against Utah
in Hawaii, but scoring is probably the least of DuBois'
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me to be able to compete, I have to work twice as hard,''
he said. ``I know I'm a step slow and a couple of inches shorter,
but if I think and give all the effort I can, I can make up for
it.'' &QL;

<P>
   Fearing that China might force their balloon to land in the
Himalaya Mountains, three balloonists received word early on
Tuesday that the Beijing government had reconsidered its ban and
would allow them to continue their round-the-world journey.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the balloon reached the Himalayas on Monday, China
unexpectedly canceled the overflight permission it had granted to
Richard Branson and his crew. By then the balloon was already over
the mountains on a course from Nepal into China, unable to return
or land.
</P>
<P>
   Frantic diplomatic efforts by Branson's ground team in London
ensued, and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain appealed for
Chinese overflight permission.
</P>
<P>
   News agencies reported from Beijing that the government
reluctantly agreed to let the balloon proceed over China, provided
that the crew made every effort to stay south of the 26th parallel,
below China's most heavily traveled air corridors.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that the ICO Global Challenge, which has already
covered one third of the distance around the world, still had a
chance of success.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, during the fourth day of their flight, the
three-member crew _ Branson, Per Lindstrand and Steve Fossett _
encountered the first serious check to their rapid progress. Soon
after they had committed their 160-foot-high balloon to a course
taking it over the Himalayas from India, the Chinese Foreign
Ministry sent word that the overflight permission it had granted
the balloonists on Nov. 26 had been withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   In a satellite telephone interview on Monday while the balloon
was over Nepal at an altitude of 29,000 feet, Fossett said: ``We're
in a real jam. We're already over the Himalayas and there's no
place to land. We have to keep going into China, and once over
Chinese territory they could order us to land, or might even shoot
us down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't turn back, we can't land and we can't avoid China,''
Fossett said.
</P>
<P>
   As Fossett spoke, the balloon was a scant 15 miles from the
Chinese border. Two hours later, in the darkness of night, the
balloon crossed into China in a region dominated by the highest
mountains in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Branson (who is the billionaire chairman of the Virgin Group)
and Lindstrand, chairman of Lindstrand Balloons Ltd., are British
subjects. Fossett, a wealthy commodities broker and a champion
long-distance balloonist, is American.
</P>
<P>
   Since the ICO Global Challenge rose from its launching site at
Marrakesh, Morocco, on Friday, jet-stream winds have whisked it
nearly a third of the way around the world. But the flight has been
anything but relaxing. On Saturday the balloonists were forced to
fly through a dangerous corridor between a line of powerful
thunderstorms in southern Turkey and the border of hostile Iraq.
The balloon also had to carefully thread its way around the borders
of Iran and Russia, which had denied it overflight permission.
</P>
<P>
   Although a balloon cannot steer, it can rise or descend, seeking
out winds blowing in the desired direction. For this, a team of
ground-based meteorologists in London constantly analyzing weather
data provides the ICO Global Challenge with essential guidance.
</P>
<P>
   No balloonists have ever come close to circling the Earth
nonstop, but more teams are expected to try in the coming months
than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Seven teams besides the ICO Global Challenge have announced
plans to try their luck. Two of them _ the Breitling Orbiter 3 from
Switzerland and the Cable &AMP; Wireless Balloon from Britain _ are
already at their launching pads in the Swiss Alps and Spain
awaiting favorable weather to start. Two others hope to be ready
before the season's weather opportunity ends in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   Three other balloon teams are planning attempts around the world
from the southern hemisphere next July.

TOMEY GETS HEFTY RAISE, EXTENSION THROUGH 2003 
</HEADLINE>
  CONTRACT-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Arizona Board of Regents unanimously approved a five-year
contract extension for Arizona football Coach Dick Tomey at a
special meeting Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Tomey said the new contract is not necessarily his last. The
five-year deal expires when he is 65.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I'm still healthy and people want me to coach, I'll
coach,'' said Tomey, whose job was rumored to be in jeopardy before
this season.
</P>
<P>
   The contract calls for a base salary of $500,000 _ $200,000 for
coaching and $300,000 for other functions, including television
programs, public relations and fund-raising. That's an increase of
more than $98,000 from his current salary.
</P>
<P>
   Incentives are included for academic and athletic performances.
</P>
<P>
   The academic incentives are on a sliding scale and range from
$5,000 to $25,000, based on the team's grade point average (2.3 to
2.7) or graduation rate (55 percent to 70 percent). The athletic
incentives include $50,000 if the team plays in the Rose, Fiesta,
Sugar or Orange Bowl and $25,000 for an appearance in any other
postseason game.
</P>
<P>
   Tomey also will be granted a license to operate a football camp
using university facilities and will keep any revenue from the
camp.
</P>
<P>
   Tomey will be paid $200,000 a year if UA terminates the contract
early. Tomey will pay $100,000 if he terminates the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Tomey was operating under a four-year contract that expires Jan.
5. The extension continues his contract through Jan. 5, 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Reports that he had agreed to a five-year contract surfaced
before the Wildcats beat Arizona State, 50-42, on Nov. 27 for an
11-1 record, their best in a football history that dates to 1899.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats have a chance to win a record-setting 12th game on
Dec. 30 against Nebraska in the Holiday Bowl at San Diego's
Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Tomey also is the winningest coach in Arizona history with an
overall record of 54-39-4. His tenure, 12 years, at UA is the
longest of any active head coach in the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   In a profession known for constant change, Tomey is unique. He
has had only two jobs since 1976. His 22 years as a head football
coach have been split between Hawaii (1976-86) and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the kind of person who is very loyal,'' said Tomey, whose
career record is 146-98-7. ``I'm loyal to players, other coaches.
When I came here from Hawaii, I was all torn up inside. I cried. I
tried to go back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I went through the whole thing. It was too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tomey said he has grown to love the university and the
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell recruits that it is a special place,'' he said. ``There
are successful people everywhere. You can run into basketball
players from a national championship team, or a swimmer with an
Olympic gold medal or a softball player with a national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a stimulating atmosphere, yet we don't have all the bells
and whistles of what some people call a premier program.'' &QL;

TOMEY NOT SURPRISED HUSKERS FAVORED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ Arizona has a better record and a higher ranking than
Nebraska, but the Cornhuskers are the favorite in the Holiday Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Say what?
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't add up. But, no, this is not another faulty equation
produced by the latest version of software math, otherwise known as
the Bowl Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Coach Dick Tomey has no problem with it at all.
Nebraska, he says, possesses a powerful, albeit intangible, factor
that wins over oddsmakers and the betting public.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a reputation standpoint, it's hard to make them the
underdog in any game,'' said Tomey, whose No. 5 Wildcats (11-1) are
a three- to four-point underdog to the No. 14 Huskers (9-3) in the
Dec. 30 game in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   It's the reputation, given Nebraska's tradition as a national
power, that makes the Holiday Bowl a potential milestone for
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats were disappointed a couple of weeks ago when a
chance at their first-ever Rose Bowl was eliminated by UCLA's loss
at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The Rose would have meant Wisconsin. The Badgers are a good
team, but their football tradition is cheesy when compared with the
Huskers'.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska shared last year's national championship with Michigan.
The Huskers have had a piece of the national title in three of the
past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their three losses this season, the Huskers represent a
chance for Arizona, an acknowledged member of college basketball's
elite, to become something more than just another address in the
football neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game means a lot to them, means a lot to us,'' said Tomey,
whose Wildcats thrived on the underdog role all season. ``It's just
not a bowl game with no meaning. It's very meaningful to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a chance to finish in the top five in the nation if we
can win it.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Forget the Rose &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since the bowl match-ups were announced, the Wildcats have been
told repeatedly that they were just one game from reaching the Rose
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong, Tomey says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't one win away from the Rose Bowl. We were one win
away from the national championship,'' said Tomey, whose club's
collapse during a brief stretch in the fourth quarter against UCLA
resulted in its only defeat, 52-28.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were five minutes away from the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We win one more game, we don't go to the Rose. We go to
Tempe.''
</P>
<P>
   Briefly &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Defensive backs A.J. Brown and Manuel Golden, redshirt freshmen
from Washington High, will not be with the Wildcats in San Diego
because of academic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Ortege Jenkins still is considering basketball. He
saw limited time as a reserve guard last season. Jenkins hopes to
speak to Coach Lute Olson about the possibility before the football
team's departure today for San Diego. Jenkins is scheduled to
undergo minor surgery on his left knee after the Holiday Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is in the running for one of next year's early season
games _ the Pigskin Classic, the Eddie Robinson Classic and the
Black Coaches Association Classic. Michigan, Penn State and Notre
Dame are possible opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats are one of five Pac-10 teams in bowl games. The
league finished 24-8 against non-conference teams. Against the Big
12, the Pac-10 was 3-2. Both losses were to Nebraska. &QL;  &QL;

CHARGERS DE FENSE CONCERNS CARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   All that stands between the Cardinals and their first playoff
berth since 1982 is San Diego's league-leading defense.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the Cardinals (8-7) have not put up points at a
record pace despite moving the ball effectively for six weeks,
beating the Chargers (5-10), even at Sun Devil Stadium, is no
guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   A win would put the Cardinals into the playoffs and end the
longest drought in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chargers have a lot of good players on the defensive side
of the ball, and (linebacker) Junior Seau is one of the premier
players in the league,'' Coach Vince Tobin said. ``It seems that
once they get started, they just feed off each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers lead the NFL in total defense and rushing defense
and rank eighth in passing defense. They gave up only 287 total
yards in a 17-10 loss to Oakland on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Jake Plummer directed the Cardinals to season-high
yardage in Sunday's comeback victory against New Orleans. In four
of the past six games, the Cardinals have reached the 400-yard mark
in total offense.
</P>
<P>
   But they have struggled in the red zone. It took them an
overtime to get to 20 points despite cranking out 424 yards in a
win at Philadelphia on Dec. 13. They got only 19 points out of 513
yards against the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turning the ball over hurts you,'' Tobin said. ``Two weeks in
a row, we've laid the ball on the ground in the red zone that kept
us from scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we continue to move the football, we will score.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the Cardinals have ended many long drives
with a turnover or with three points instead of seven. Only three
weeks ago, the Cardinals led the league in red zone scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get better there,'' Plummer said. ``We only had
one touchdown against the Saints, and that was a run from outside
the red zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer suggested that the Cardinals continue their no-huddle
offense even after reaching striking distance. The no-huddle has
been responsible for them piling up big yardage between the 20-yard
lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to call different plays that don't always work for
us,'' Plummer said. ``We need to go no-huddle all the way to the
end zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Of equal concern to Tobin is having his defense begin to
approximate its early season performances. Getting some of the
injured players back this weekend would help.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said it is possible that defensive tackle Mark Smith
(ankle), linebacker Ron McKinnon (knee) and injury-prone cornerback
Tom Knight could be back for the finale, even though Knight
suffered a broken hand Sunday in the win over New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just found out about that,'' Tobin said. ``He can play in a
cast. He has been snake-bit his first two years. Mark Smith has a
chance to be ready, and Ron McKinnon was dressed for our last game.
We were going to use him on passing downs, but our defense was
playing so well early that we held him out.'' &QL;

MIAMI _ An irrefutable fact: One-on-one, Dan Marino owns John
Elway.
</P>
<P>
   It would also appear that Lamar Thomas at least owns the option
on the Broncos' secondary.
</P>
<P>
   In a Monday-night game Miami needed to win and Denver only had
to survive with its major pieces intact, Marino found Thomas to be
an eager accomplice on three of his four touchdown passes _ a total
sufficient to keep him undefeated in head-to-head encounters with
his 1983 rookie classmate and fellow Hall of Famer-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphin Danny, after all, also won their previous meeting way
back in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Well, undefeated is undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   How, we ask, could it be that 12 seasons would slip by until
there was finally a rematch? A fluke of scheduling, it would seem.
But because of Marino's big night, resulting in a 31-21 Miami
victory, there exists the chance for another confrontation in short
order.
</P>
<P>
   Having qualified for the playoffs, the Dolphins gave themselves
a shot at doing unto the Broncos again before the current season is
put to bed. Suddenly, the AFC title looks up for grabs, and Marino,
who hasn't claimed one since his second season in the NFL 14 years
ago, might be the guy to grab it.
</P>
<P>
   Having watched Elway get his Super Bowl ring last January after
such a long, frustrating quest, Marino must figure that fair is
fair. ``My turn,'' he's telling himself.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Johnson has given Marino a no-quarter defense he can win
with, as Elway will attest. Based on this convincing result,
Johnson might also be ready to concede Marino a more free hand in
directing the oft-conservative Miami offense.
</P>
<P>
   When you can put up the sort of numbers Marino did _ 23-for-38,
355 yards, plus the four TDs _ against a defending Super Bowl
champion that began its encore season 13-0, you obviously deserve
the opportunity to be the master of your own fate.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who had a raging ego even before he led Dallas to a
pair of world championships, has stubbornly reined in Marino for
most of the year, leading to an undercurrent of friction between
the two. The coach may have to rethink his strategy now.
</P>
<P>
   All things considered, Marino has rarely come up bigger under
more scrutinized circumstances, magnified by the near-historic
nature of the matchup. As for Elway, who had two of his passes
intercepted and 21 others _ out of 36 total _ fall incomplete,
he'll ask his coach, Mike Shanahan, to burn the tape.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Broncos did lead early, their only offensive
touchdown of the evening was hardly befitting such a clash of
late-20th-century legends, whose prolific, parallel careers have
seen them complete passes for roughly 62 NFL miles between them.
</P>
<P>
   Uncharacteristically fumble-fingered, Elway essentially batted
the ball into the end zone, where Rod Smith happened to be in the
right place to fall on it.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing much broke right for Denver the rest of the way. When
Elway, never mind his scrambling skills, outrushes Terrell Davis
(16 carries, 29 yards), you suspect the Broncos aren't going to be
happy with the result.
</P>
<P>
   And they weren't.
</P>
<P>
   Marino, who trails Elway only in the categories of yards gained
scrambling (3,399 vs. 90) and Super Bowls won (1 vs. 0), would put
the Dolphins on the board in more traditional fashion right before
the end of the first half by dropping a nine-yard pass into Thomas'
waiting fingers despite wetsuit-snug coverage by the Broncos' Tito
Paul.
</P>
<P>
   If you're counting _ and with these guys, it's best to do so
carefully, using a calculator _ that was the 404th touchdown pass
of Marino's 16 seasons. It was also No. 700 for the two of them
combined.
</P>
<P>
   No. 701, covering 56 yards, followed shortly after the start of
the second half. The Broncos' George Coghill gambled on an
all-or-nothing interception at the sideline, and when he came up
clutching air instead of leather, Thomas was all by his lonesome
with nothing except green grass and white stripes between him and
the Denver end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Nos. 702 and 703 were a 17-yarder to Thomas in the third quarter
and an eight-yarder to Oronde Gadsden in the fourth, respectively.
Besides securing the playoff-clinching victory, they helped
separate Marino from Elway in another significant statistical
category: most career 3,000-yard-passing seasons, 13 for the former
to 12 for the latter.
</P>
<P>
   At 10-5, Miami locked up the last AFC wild-card berth _ ensuring
the Oilers' name will live for just one more game _ and at least
technically kept alive Marino's waning hopes of returning to the
Super Bowl after a hiatus of 13 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In defeat, the Broncos now own a losing streak. After winning 18
consecutive games, one of them Super Bowl XXXII, they have dropped
two in a row. Shanahan conceded Denver ``got embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   When it's a Marino doing the embarrassing, though, the shame is
manageable. He's done this to people before, you know.

SENTENCINGS IN CHINA PUT WHITE HOUSE ON DEFENSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 1st and 3rd grafs to correct number of dissidents sentenced) (Eds: See also CHINA-DISSIDENTS, CHINA-LIU) 
(mk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Six months after President Clinton traveled to
Beijing and challenged China's leaders to move rapidly toward
political reform, the administration's policy of engaging Beijing
was called into question Monday when Chinese courts sentenced three
of the nation's most prominent dissidents to long jail sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of China on Capitol Hill and human rights groups said
the tough prison terms were evidence of the failure of the
administration's policy of encouraging trade and diplomatic ties
with China in hopes of democratic reform.
</P>
<P>
   The dissidents _ Xu Wenli, who was sentenced Monday to 13 years
in prison, Wang Youcai, who received an 11-year sentence, and Qin
Yongming, who was reported to have received 12 years were charged
with subversion.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said it had received reports from sources
it did not identify that a third leading democracy campaigner, Qin
Yongmin, had been sentenced to 13 years in prison after a trial
last week in the city of Wuhan. Relatives of Qin in China denied
the reports, however, and said that his trial continued.
</P>
<P>
   Given Clinton's effusive praise for China's senior leaders
during his trip to Beijing last summer, the administration found
itself on the defensive Monday and harshly criticized the prison
sentences, even as it continued to insist that the administration's
policy of engagement was helping push Beijing toward democracy.
</P>
<P>
   James Foley, a State Department spokesman, said the United
States ``deeply deplores'' the jail terms and called for the
immediate release of the dissidents. ``These three men appear to
have been involved in nothing more than efforts to form a new
political party,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While condemning the prison sentences, Foley and other American
officials were careful to note the administration's assessment that
there had been progress in human rights in China, some of it linked
to Clinton's meeting in Beijing with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There had been improvements in the human rights situation in
China, modest improvements,'' Foley said. The severe prison terms _
and other recent instances of harassment of democracy campaigners
in China _ are ``steps backward in relationship to what had been an
improved human rights performance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the administration's China policy noted that the long
prison sentences were handed out less than a week after Jiang
delivered a pointed speech in Beijing in which he made clear that
China's economic reforms were not a prelude to Western-style
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Western mode of political systems must never be copied,''
he said, adding that those who challenged the Communist Party's
supremacy would be crushed.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who has long been among China's
harshest critics in Congress, said the prison sentences handed out
to Xu and Wang were ``the clearest demonstration'' since the
president's visit to China last summer of Beijing's ``true
intentions regarding human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are pathetic, really pathetic,'' she said of the
administration. ``The administration can say what it wants, but it
must know Monday that its policy on China is an embarrassment. What
the Chinese have learned is that they have all the latitude in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director for Human Rights Group,
said the jail terms were proof of the need for the administration
to revise its China policy, which he described as ``almost
entirely'' driven by the administration's desire to encourage
trade.
</P>
<P>
   He said that while there had been some signs of progress in the
human rights situation in China over the last year _ notably,
China's agreement to sign international treaties on civil and
economic rights _ the overall picture was bleak.
</P>
<P>
   ``On balance,'' he said, ``any progress China has made by
allowing greater openness may have been canceled out by a more
repressive attitude.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch, the largest American-based human rights
group, called on the administration to consider postponing or
canceling a planned visit to China early next year by Commerce
Secretary William Daley and a high-level trade delegation as a
protest over the prison sentences. ``That would get Beijing's
attention,'' Jendrzejczck said.
</P>
<P>
   Other China experts and scholars insisted that the
administration was right to continue its policy of engagement with
China, and that there was reason to believe that political reform
would follow economic reform, as Clinton has argued.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Rodman, a former Nixon and Reagan administration official
now at the Nixon Center in Washington, said that ``the United
States cannot control the evolution of a society as complex as
China's.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the harsh prison sentences given out Monday to the
dissidents were to be expected, especially since Xu and Wang had
been involved in trying to set up a political party to challenge
the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pattern of this regime is that every once in a while, they
ease up a bit and somebody goes too far and there's a crisis,'' he
said. ``I don't think you can blame the United States for this
crackdown, nor can you give us credit for any political reforms. On
human rights, I just don't think there's much more we can do.''

these findings, many biologists held out hope that some females
might be faithful, particularly to exemplary, hard-working fathers,
as in the bird species known as the wattled jacana. But research

USC BEATS AMERICAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It didn't really matter who USC played Monday
night, because the Trojans just wanted to forget their previous
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Which is probably a good thing, since USC might not have been
overly excited playing American University.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles were merely bit players, however, providing the
perfect opportunity for the Trojans to get past their 29-point loss
to Kansas on Dec. 12.
</P>
<P>
   USC took a successful first step toward erasing that woeful
encounter, disposing of American 74-59 before 2,346 at the Sports
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to play this game (last) Monday,'' USC forward Brian
Scalabrine said. ``You're only as good as your last game. We had to
come back with a statement.''
</P>
<P>
   USC's statement against American was that its inside game does
indeed exist. Which is fortunate, because the Trojans shot just 25
percent on 3-pointers (4-16) against the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine was the big winner, getting more opportunities inside
than usual, and he responded with a career-high 26 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't really made a conscious effort to get the ball
inside like we did tonight,'' USC coach Henry Bibby said. ``We
relied on the jump shot (against Kansas). The Kansas game was a
bitter game for us. It probably was good for us. It got the
attention of not only the players, but the coaching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   USC (7-1) never really pulled away from American (3-7) until
late in the second half, but that's becoming the Trojans'
trademark, at least when they play someone other than Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   After holding a 58-47 advantage, the Trojans went on a 12-0 run
that included seven points from Scalabrine. USC led 70-47, and only
some late baskets in garbage time helped American close the gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our best attribute is our little runs,'' Scalabrine
said. ``But we know when we get into Pac-10 games, you've got to be
able to play hard for 40 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby also threw a new wrinkle into the game by giving junior
point guard Quincy Wilder and freshman forward David Bluthenthal
their most significant minutes of the season. Bluthenthal had six
points and six rebounds while Wilder had nine points in his first
game since becoming the No. 2 point guard after Kevin Augustine
quit the team last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally get to settle down into a position,'' Wilder said.
``I like being one of the leaders of the team.'
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks ago, Wilder considered quitting the team, but
decided to stay, and then watched Augustine depart after he became
unhappy with his role on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it was a sign or not that Kevin left,'' Wilder
said. ``With me, it was just a misunderstanding that I wasn't
practicing at my capabilities. (Quitting) isn't an option for me.
Before, it wasn't a total option. It was me being down on myself.
It was hard for me to switch to the Division I level.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby said Bluthenthal's performance in practice demanded more
playing time, something the freshman from Westchester has been
eager for since the start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm itching for minutes,'' Bluthenthal said. ``I'm going hard
in practice, and I know if I go hard, I'll play.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: USC is off to its best start since 1991-92, when the
Trojans also went 7-1.... The Trojans have won their past seven
home games (5-0 this season).

MISSES CHANCES BRING DOWN DUCKS

   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Everything appeared to be going the Anaheim
Mighty Ducks' way Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   They had just taken the lead over Colorado. Avalanche goalie
Patrick Roy had just high-sticked Paul Kariya and compounded his
mistake by slamming his stick to the ice and drawing an
unsportsmanlike penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's red-hot power-play unit, which had already scored
once, was going to take the ice for four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But appearances can be deceiving. Anaheim squandered its chance
to put the Avalanche away and ended up giving away the game,
dropping a 4-2 decision before 16,568 at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   The loss stopped the Ducks' unbeaten streak at six (4-0-2) and
ended Colorado's four-game winless streak (0-3-1).
</P>
<P>
   While Anaheim's normally reliable power play let it down, it was
the struggling Colorado power play that accounted for the crucial
goal of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks had killed off a 36-second two-man disadvantage and
had only seven seconds left before Kevin Haller was to come out of
the penalty box. But before Haller was released, Colorado's
0-for-27 power-play drought was ended and Anaheim's streak of 23
consecutive penalty kills was over.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Drury, brother of the Ducks' Ted, got a centering pass
just by the stick of Jamie Pushor and Milan Hejduk beat Guy Hebert
on the stick side with 50 seconds left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Claude Lemieux iced the game at 12:07 of the third period when
he scored his second goal of the game on a two-on-one break with
Valeri Kamensky.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado had taken the early lead on Adam Deadmarsh's goal at
10:59 of the first period. But the Avalanche made the mistake of
taking not one, but two penalties in the span of 51 seconds to give
the Ducks' power play a two-man advantage for 69 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim took advantage of the opportunity when Kariya put a
shot-style pass right on the stick of Teemu Selanne, who tipped it
high into the Colorado net at 13:17 for his 13th goal of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne's sixth goal in the past four games marked the 15th
straight home game that Anaheim has scored a power-play goal. The
Ducks have failed to score on the power play only once in 17 games
at the Pond this season.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya's assist increased his point total to a league-leading
41. He also leads the NHL in power-play points (21) and power-play
assists (16).
</P>
<P>
   With the Avalanche still a man down, the Ducks nearly scored
again, but Roy stopped Antti Aalto's bid from the slot.
</P>
<P>
   Roy wasn't so sharp at 3:29 when Travis Green took a drop pass
from Marty McInnis and beat the Colorado goalie with a 30-footer.
</P>
<P>
   But Hebert wasn't any sharper at the other end when Shean
Donovan's shot from the left circle bounced off his glove and
trickled into the net at 10:21, allowing Colorado to tie the game,
2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan's goal came just after the Ducks' botched four-minute
power play and but 10 seconds after McInnis had a great chance to
give Anaheim a two-goal lead but shot wide as he cut across in
front of Roy.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado had the best of the chances early on and the Avalanche
took the lead when the slumping Deadmarsh slipped a 10-footer
between Hebert and the left post. The goal was only the second in
13 games for Deadmarsh.

USC DEFENSIVE TACKLE ARRESTED FOR TRESPASSING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC defensive tackle Aaron Williams was arrested
for trespassing in Costa Mesa last week, but coach Paul Hackett
said Monday that Williams simply ``found himself in the wrong place
at the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams declined comment. He was arrested for trespassing, and
was also found to be driving with an expired license and had
outstanding traffic tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said Williams got lost while trying to find a friend's
house in Orange County. A resident noticed Williams in the
neighborhood and called police. Hackett was disturbed because the
resident then made a citizen's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He basically got lost,'' Hackett said. ``I have a real problem
with a citizen's arrest. I don't think there's much else to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said Williams' legal problem will not affect his status
for the Dec. 31 Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel that you're innocent until proven guilty in all
areas,'' Hackett said. ``It's really terrible to preempt the normal
process.''
</P>
<P>
   At USC's recent football banquet, Williams was the recipient of
the Bob Chandler Award, which goes to the underclassman
demonstrating excellence in athletics, academics and character. He
also represented USC at an NCAA leadership conference last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has been bothered by a high ankle sprain and has not
practiced the past three weeks. Hackett said he thinks Williams
will be available for the game, however, and will try to have the
defensive tackle practice next week.
</P>
<P>
   If Williams can't play, Hackett said freshman Ryan Nielsen and
sophomore Shamsud Abdul-Shaheed will fill in at defensive tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a significant adjustment,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes in doubt: Hackett said wide receiver Windrell Hayes is
still bothered by a sprained toe and may not be able to play in the
Sun Bowl. Hayes will try to practice today but a decision on his
availability will not be made until next week.
</P>
<P>
   All is well: Hackett was happy Monday because he finally liked
the Trojans' intensity at practice, after being disappointed with
the enthusiasm at last week's sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a huge difference,'' Hackett said. ``We really zeroed
in. I'm going to sleep better. We got (last) Saturday's practice
behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding common ground: Asked to compare Texas Christian to USC's
previous opponents, Hackett said the Horned Frogs' offense is
similar to Notre Dame's option attack, while the defense reminds
him of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean USC will win 33-0, since the Trojans scored 33
points against Washington and shut out Notre Dame?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh right,'' said Hackett, who hardly bought that theory.

ERICKSON'S MEDIOCRE REIGN IN SEATTLE JUST ABOUT AT AN END 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What separates Dennis Erickson from Jim Fassel, Norv Turner,
Dave Wannstedt, Pete Carroll, Bruce Coslet or Jeff Fisher is
anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think that the Seahawks coach _ and Erickson will be in
that position at least through Sunday _ has not asked himself, and
maybe a few of his supporters, that same question.
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday, perhaps as soon as Monday, Erickson might get a
year off with pay _ $1 million is left on his original five-year
deal _ which should leave him with a lot of time to golf, a reward
Erickson deserves for what have been four seasons of, basically,
hell.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the fires that burned him lept from coals not of
Erickson's making: There was Ken Behring; a depleted roster due to
bad drafts during Tom Flores' years; Rick Mirer as franchise
quarterback; Behring's California Dreamin' mission in Los Angeles;
and the franchise's sale to Paul Allen, whose commitment to Seattle
means providing a winner, right now.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the flames Erickson fanned himself: Awful special teams
that lost four games in '97; a decision to go to a two-back running
game in '98 at the expense of a passing game that was effective in
'97; and sticking with Warren Moon when the moribund offense needed
a Jon Kitna kick start, or something.
</P>
<P>
   In a sport where the head coach might have the greatest impact
on whether his team wins or loses each critical, chess-match week,
more than a handful of NFL coaches endure despite resum &UR; gfacute &LR; es
that clearly demonstrate mediocrity in action.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants under Fassel might have derailed Denver's perfect
season, but Big Blue has been mired in a Big Deep funk ever since
Bill Parcells left to attend to his cardiac care, two Super Bowl
rings adorning his manipulative fingers.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' slide lasted all the way through Dan Reeves' tenure,
too, so how do you explain Reeves' latest incarnation in Atlanta,
where he has reclaimed head-coaching stardom now that the Falcons
appear legitimate contenders?
</P>
<P>
   Yet even Reeves, while in New York, could not make a dent in the
annual futility of the post-Parcells Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Different stories of futility and underachievement emanate from
Chicago and Washington D.C., not unlike the glumness that has
surrounded these Hawks. Wannstedt and Turner _ both former Jimmy
Johnson assistants who were touted as the NFL's newest coaching
hotshots _ have since been on and off the hot seat so many times,
they look as if they're dancing a jig.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Bengals, how can a perennial loser like Coslet
continue NFL head-coaching employment if Erickson is on the verge
of a pink slip?
</P>
<P>
   Same with Fisher. If the Oilers' head coach keeps getting more
rope because he had the misfortune of presiding over the Oilers'
disruptive move from Houston to Tennessee, why shouldn't Erickson,
who endured former Hawk owner Ken Behring's foray to Southern
California?
</P>
<P>
   And if Pete Carroll's job is no longer in danger because the
Patriots rose from near death to beat the 49ers and make the
playoffs, doesn't Erickson get one free swing at NFL referee Phil
Luckett, whose bungled call in the Jets game helped keep the
Seahawks from the playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the 49ers and Steve Mariucci: His contract talks
reportedly have stalled, prompting the rumor mill to match the
third-year coach's name with the job in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   If Mariucci can lose five straight at Cal, preside over the
demise of the 49ers organization and still be a hot name for a
coveted expansion job with the Browns, again, it must be asked, why
has Erickson's pink slip been all but written?
</P>
<P>
   One reason: So much of coaching in the NFL is a crapshoot,
unless you are:
</P>
<P>
   A) Lucky enough to be a titan or a savior, like Parcells or
offensive wizard Mike Shanahan in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   B) Lucky enough to fall into a class organization laced with
talent on and off the field in which no weakness will be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   Examples? The 49ers with Carmen Policy, Ed DeBartolo, Bill
Walsh, Joe Montana or Steve Young. Or the Bills, when general
manager Bill Polian was helping Marv Levy string together years of
winning everything but the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Dallas during the years owner Jerry Jones was spending
like a sheik and Minnesota was willing to take Herschel Walker in
an era-defining trade for nearly the entire Vikings roster.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, it has been Green Bay under the collective
stewardship of general manager Ron Wolf and Mike Holmgren, or Tom
Donahoe and Bill Cowher in Pittsburgh, before so many free agents
found greener pastures and Kordell Stewart came up empty.
</P>
<P>
   It is now the Seahawks' turn to solidify this franchise and
become one of the NFL's recognized winners, which means that time
has run out for Erickson and his staff.
</P>
<P>
   That is the only thing that separates Erickson from a bevy of
other NFL coaches who endure despite mediocre results.
</P>
<P>
   It will not be with glee that Erickson is let go. And it will
not be easy to find the perfect leader for the NFL's newest
juggernaut wannabe. But the lacing of top-grade talent in the
owner's box, on the roster, in the administrative office and now,
on the sideline, is imperative.

BROKEN RECORD(S): STEPHENVILLE WAS THE BEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY PHILLIPS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The litany of milestones accomplished by
Stephenville that culminated in a 34-7 Class 4A Division II
championship against La Marque reads about as long as the Yellow
Jackets' playbook.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Stephenville immediately reloads at quarterback and
receiver in 1999, it could be years before another team in Texas
matches the offensive exploits of the 1998 'Jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Was, then, Stephenville the most unstoppable high school team of
all time in Texas?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were pretty close,'' senior quarterback Kelan Luker
said. ``I felt like we could do anything we wanted this year.''
</P>
<P>
   In six playoff games, Stephenville averaged 503.7 total yards
and 39.7 points. The 'Jackets finished the 1998 season with 8,584
total yards, a national and state single-season record for total
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Luker broke state records for single-season (4,697) and career
passing yards (8,294). Cody Cardwell, the fifth 100-catch receiver
in state history, now owns the unofficial national record for
single-season receiving yards (2,422) and the state career yardage
record (4,343).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've known all year what we were able to do,'' Cardwell said.
``We had another great passing game. It all came together.''
</P>
<P>
   Other notable Stephenville feats this season included:
</P>
<P>
   Luker's 49 touchdown passes were the third-best season total in
state history, a mark held by Turkey Valley's Kirk Saul (54) in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   Kicker J.W. Boren's 87 extra points were second only to Austin
Westlake's Kam Praytor (89) in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenville ended La Marque's run of three consecutive state
titles and is 3-0 against the Cougars in state championship games.
La Marque allowed a season-high 34 points and was held to a
season-low seven.
</P>
<P>
   Cardwell's 206 career receptions are fourth all-time in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenville halted the state's current longest winning streak,
held by La Marque, at 20. The Cougars were held to a season-low 128
total yards after averaging 314.6 per game.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenville and La Marque are tied for the most state titles
(three) by a Class 4A team this decade. Stephenville, La Marque,
Abilene (now 5A), and Wichita Falls, all with three, have the most
4A state titles.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, it was the moment, not records, that the Yellow
Jackets were caught up in. Seniors Luker and Cardwell were
surprisingly calm, perhaps because both knew it was their last
hurrah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't hardly stand it,'' Luker said. ``We were up by three
touchdowns and I was waiting for who we were going to play next. I
don't get that chance anymore. It's the best time I've had in my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Other seniors such as receiver Chris Evatt, who caught five
passes for 104 yards against La Marque, are sorry to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to come back and do this again,'' Evatt said. ``It's
been unbelievable. I'm just glad Kelan was our quarterback this
year and led us to state.''
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that Stephenville, the District 6-4A runner-up, made
defeating the state's No. 1-ranked team in La Marque look easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it certainly wasn't easy,'' said Stephenville coach Art
Briles, who returns 13 starters next season. ``I really thought our
defense came through for us and stopped them when it we needed it
most. They've come through for us all year.''

 &HT;    Bitter feud tearing apart body politic
 &HT;    (EDS: Moved Monday; Repeating for those who need it.)By Tom
Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington _ It came down to that fateful morning, when it
seemed history would finally take precedence over news, when it
seemed no more short-term shocks could overshadow the gravity
implicit in the first impeachment of an elected president of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   That was the way things felt Saturday, briefly, before Rep. Bob
Livingston got up to announce his resignation and the anxieties of
the moment came rushing back to elbow history aside one more time.
</P>
<P>
   That chaotic, angry moment, when the Democrats began their chant
for Livingston to resign, delaying him for a few seconds from doing
just that, encapsulated as well as any the anguish in a capital
which has come to seem more like a dysfunctional family at the
verge of a breakdown than a two-party government doing the business
of the people.
</P>
<P>
   At year's end the toll could be expressed in this way: Two
articles of impeachment, and a permanent scar on the president's
record. Two Republican speakers derailed as well as the party's
agenda, at least for the short term. And in the country, a deep and
roiling discontent that will have consequences as yet unmeasurable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very saddened and troubled that we would arrive at this
point,'' Rep. John Lewis said. ``We're tearing this place apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost instantaneously, Livingston's announcement that he will
leave Congress and not stand for speaker produced a bizarre change
in the political current.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats who jeered Livingston when he rose to speak
suddenly became the chorus calling for him to stay. Rep. Jesse
Jackson Jr. and two other Democrats rushed to his office to urge
him to reconsider, as other Democrats decried the poisonous
atmosphere that brought on his downfall.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Republicans who had applauded when Livingston
confessed his sexual indiscretions a couple of nights before were
already jostling to choose his successor. Rep. Bob Barr said later
in the day that between the time he rose to his seat and walked out
to the Speaker's Gallery, a few feet away, five GOP members came up
and asked him to support one or another candidate for speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans would be setting up lie detectors, joked Rep. Joe
Barton of Texas, to make sure the next speaker had not pushed any
old ladies in front of cars or any other awful thing.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports that support for Livingston had begun to
erode in the Republican caucus, prompting his decision. Livingston
posed his resignation as ``an example I hope President Clinton will
follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi gave the definitive answer to that suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resignation is not in his DNA,'' the California Democrat said.
Clinton, at his White House rally with congressional Democrats
after the impeachment vote, confirmed her prediction, vowing to
stay on until ``the last hour and the last day of my term.''
</P>
<P>
   That promise sets the stage for a titanic standoff in the coming
year, unless there can be a compromise, which seemed a distant
possibility on this rancorous day.
</P>
<P>
   New York Democrat Charles Schumer, who voted against impeachment
as his last act in the House and will have it as his first order of
business in the Senate next year, was pessimistic that the public's
desire for a speedy resolution can be achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be tremendous pressure on (Senate Majority
Leader) Trent Lott from the radical right to push a trial,'' said
Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   As a historical matter, it only mattered that one of the
articles of impeachment passed Saturday. As a political matter, the
fact that two of the four articles failed could have more
significance that might appear at first glance.
</P>
<P>
   That marginal difference could make it more comfortable for some
Democratic senators to stick with their president. For their part,
the Democratic House members seemed more relaxed in defeat than the
Republicans did in victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe the other side has begun to feel the wrath of
the American people,'' said Rep. Sanford Bishop, whose victory in
his southeast Georgia district this November is Exhibit A for
Democrats nervous about the political costs of loyalty to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to his office were mostly anti-impeachment before the
impeachment debate began this week, Bishop said. When the debate
began, the pro- and anti- calls were about even, but as the debate
has gone on, the anti-impeachment calls again became predominant.
</P>
<P>
   As for Congress itself, few members voiced any hope there can be
any progress on legislation in the coming year, both because of the
Senate trial and the hardening animosity on both sides of the party
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the place needs to take a deep breath,'' said Democrat
Vic Fazio of California. ``But I don't think we will have that
opportunity.''

 &HT;    Florida tribe takes on powerful foe
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A century and a half after soldiers
chased them deep into the Everglades, the Miccosukee Indians are
still at war.
</P>
<P>
   This time, their weapons include lawyers, consultants and expert
witnesses, paid with proceeds from bingo, tobacco and tourism.
Their opponents are the state and federal agencies that rule what
remains of the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   And this time, the Indians expect to win.
</P>
<P>
   Among their recent milestones:
</P>
<P>
   _ In October, Congress and President Clinton finally guaranteed
the Miccosukees' right to live forever in a 5-mile swath of
Everglades National Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians had been living there under a 50-year lease due to
expire in 2014 _ and under the thumb of the National Park Service,
which long blocked the tribe's plans to build 65 houses south of
Tamiami Trail.
</P>
<P>
   _ Soon, the Miccosukees expect the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency to grant them the right to set tough pollution standards for
their lands. That could let the tribe dictate how strictly the
state must clean runoff from sugar farms, at least in part of the
northern Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   _ And in September, a judge in Miami agreed with the tribe that
the state's $763 million plan for cleaning the Everglades is so
lenient it violates federal law. The plan stands for now, but the
judge told federal regulators to review it.
</P>
<P>
   In a half-dozen other legal challenges, the Miccosukees blame
state water managers and federal engineers for polluting the
tribe's land and drowning their cypress hammocks.
</P>
<P>
   It's a high-profile role for a tribe of fewer than 400 members,
a little larger than the population of Manalapan. Soft-spoken and
describing themselves as peaceful, the Miccosukees say they want to
be left alone, free to run their own lives, pass on their language
and customs, and enjoy their lives amid the saw grass.
</P>
<P>
   One target of the suits contends they sometimes mire the
Everglades restoration instead of hastening it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having someone crack the whip behind us, saying, `Move
faster,' isn't always helpful,' '' said Sam Poole, executive
director of the South Florida Water Management District.
</P>
<P>
   But Billy Cypress, the tribe's elected chairman, said he has to
push the government to do more for the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   ``God's not making any of this type of real estate anymore,'' he
said in the tribe's government center 40 miles west of Miami
</P>
<P>
   How much have these fights cost the tribe? ``All I can say is,
`millions,' '' Cypress said.
</P>
<P>
   Cypress said the struggle has won the tribe few friends. In
getting Congress to approve the new housing, the Miccosukees
opposed most of the environmental groups that usually applaud the
Indians' lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Though they sympathized with Miccosukee families crammed two or
three to a home, the environmentalists said it's dangerous to give
anyone an unrestricted slice of a national park. They fear Congress
may use the precedent to open other parks to oil drilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for these people,'' Cypress, 48, said of the
environmentalists. ``I get a letter from them every now and then
saying, `Hurray, you're our hero.' Then they turn around and don't
reward the hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Estenoz, an activist for the World Wildlife Fund,
acknowledged that ``there was a lot of angst involved'' in opposing
the housing bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Miccosukees live in the Everglades and we don't,'' she
said. ``So their perspective on issues that physically affect them
is going to be different at times.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first or last time the allies have clashed.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, the tribe proposed exploratory oil drilling
just outside the Everglades, leaving many environmentalists aghast.
</P>
<P>
   They also disagree on the park's proposal to buy out a rural,
mostly Hispanic enclave of 8.5 square miles in the east Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Most environmental groups say the enclave is blocking the
restoration of natural water flows. But Miccosukee consultants,
talking on Spanish-language radio, say the purchases will delay
Everglades restoration for years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Estenoz said she hopes environmentalists and the tribe
will keep working together. She said the tribe has been a crucial
ally, with two advantages that most environmental groups lack _ the
money for expensive lawsuits and the legal standing of a sovereign
government.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Everglades activist Joe Browder said the tribe's
lawsuits have been virtually the only force against attempts by
state officials to settle for less than a full clean-up. ``The
tribe is doing very lonely and important work,'' said Browder, a
protege of the late environmentalist Marjory Stoneman Douglas. He
believed in the tribe's right to build more houses in the
Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   For Miccosukees, combativeness is nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe gained federal recognition in 1962, but only after its
leaders embarrassed Washington by making a state visit to Fidel
Castro. Five years ago, during a lawsuit over control of their
2,000-seat bingo palace west of Miami, the Miccosukees had their
police barricade the gambling hall and challenged federal marshals
to seize it.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe won't say how much it earns from bingo, video gambling
and $10-a-pot poker, although news accounts of the gambling suit
estimated that people plopped down $5 million in wagers each month.
(In comparison, the Mashantucket Pequot tribe in Connecticut takes
in as much as $1 million daily at its full-scale casino.)
</P>
<P>
   The Miccosukees' bingo hall seems to be doing well enough _ a
300-plus-room hotel is going up next door.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe also won't disclose the earnings from its other
businesses. Those include a drive-through tobacco store free from
state taxes, a Shell service station along Alligator Alley and a
tourist village, museum and airboat rides on Tamiami Trail.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe's best weapon may be Dexter Lehtinen, a former U.S.
attorney in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   While with the government, Lehtinen filed a 1988 suit against
Florida that forced the state to start cleaning Everglades
pollution. After leaving the government in 1992, he returned to the
case as the Miccosukees' general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics accused Lehtinen of pushing the tribe into court.
Cypress, though, said he's pushing Lehtinen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I'm like a preacher, telling him he's not strong
enough,'' Cypress said.
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen, who spends at least half his time on tribe business,
wouldn't say how much he and his four lawyers on the case have
earned.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe's consultants include Ron Jones, a Florida
International University biologist who was a star witness for the
feds when Lehtinen filed his 1988 suit.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe also hired Terry Rice, retired colonel of the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, who was so popular among environmentalists
that Sen. Bob Graham tried to cajole the Pentagon last year into
keeping him in office.
</P>
<P>
   Now Rice _ who calls himself a ``neo-environmentalist'' _ has
some former fans rolling their eyes as he criticizes government
efforts to protect the endangered Cape Sable seaside sparrow from
flooding. That rescue worsened floods in the central Everglades,
including tribal land, killing trees and ruining crops for the
sacred Green Corn Dance. Rice contends it was based on flawed
science.
</P>
<P>
   Rice admits that many of the environmentalists who once praised
him now call him a ``scoundrel.'' But he said only the tribe is
pushing a restoration that makes sense for the entire Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're out to get the truth and see that it gets done,'' Rice
said.

 &HT;    ACLU sends letter to Mayor concerning controversial designation
 &HT;    By Julie Kemble Borths
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Miamisburg Mayor Dick Church routinely designates
days, weeks and months for this cause or that. But proclaiming 1999
``The Year of the Bible,'' may have crossed the line of
church-state separation.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the American Civil Liberties Union sent Church a
strongly worded letter asking him to rescind the designation or
``invite litigation from the ACLU.''
</P>
<P>
   Church, through city spokesman Gary Giles, declined comment. But
Giles said Church presented the proclamation Dec. 10 to local
representatives of the American Bible Society and the all-Christian
Miamisburg Ministerial Association.
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Nichols, a society volunteer, said the proclamation ``is
not breaking any law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Christians do have freedom in this country,'' she said. ``I
think the American Civil Liberties Union is seeking to proclaim its
wishes upon the people.''
</P>
<P>
   But ACLU General Counsel Scott Greenwood said the proclamation
``isn't one of those muddled issues.'' By stating ``all citizens of
Miamisburg are encouraged to read through the New Testament for at
least five minutes daily'' _ endorses Christianity, Greenwood said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not a Christian community. There is no such thing in
this country,'' Greenwood said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, such moves by governments across the country
have raised questions. In November, a federal judge ruled against
Arizona Gov. Jane Hull's Bible Week proclamation. In March, a town
in New Mexico fought bitterly about a Year of the Bible
proclamation for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Ronald Mixer, the Year of the Bible program director for
the New York-based American Bible Society said his organization
generally discourages enlisting the support of government entities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our desire is not to bring conflict to people but to bring
God's word that provides hope,'' he said. ``We are looking to
encourage people to read the New Testament.''
</P>
<P>
   Miamisburg First Church of God Pastor Mark McCain, one of 28
members of the ministerial association, said the local effort
involves churches and businesses distributing copies of the New
Testament along with a guide for daily reading. He said while the
proclamation encourages the effort, Church did so ``as a citizen
like anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Giles said while designating a complete year is unusual, Church
did so ``not as an official part of any city council agenda'' or
during a council meeting.
</P>
<P>
   He said the city attorney is reviewing the matter.

 &HT;    `Feel good' business getting out of hand
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ A few of my colleagues and I have nicknamed
our new middle school counselor ``Dr. Feelgood.'' Fortunately, he's
a pretty good-natured guy and when we poke a little fun at him he
just grins and gets back at us later.
</P>
<P>
   This morning's dialogue was pretty typical.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Feelgood: Bobby tells me he wanted to come to my office
yesterday but he
</P>
<P>
   wasn't allowed to leave class.
</P>
<P>
   Teacher: He wants to go to your office every day.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Feelgood: His hamster died.
</P>
<P>
   Teacher: Last year his grandmother died four times.
</P>
<P>
   My fellow eighth-grade teachers and I are not insensitive clods,
but enough
</P>
<P>
   already. If we got worked up every time one of our 13-year-olds
went hysterical
</P>
<P>
   over a zit, we'd be bunking down in a rubber room somewhere. We
tell Dr. Feelgood that's his job and we'd rather he do it on his
own time. We ask him if
</P>
<P>
   breakdowns could be scheduled to coincide with study halls.
</P>
<P>
   Every once in a while I suspect the ``feel good'' business of
running amok.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at what happened in Pennsylvania at Swarthmore
College. On Nov. 8,
</P>
<P>
   some students complained of finding vomit and excrement on the
floor of one of
</P>
<P>
   the rooms in the Intercultural Center.
</P>
<P>
   Disgusting? You bet. A political statement? I doubt it. Sounds
more like an over-imbibed student and a few pranksters, but a lot
of folks got all bent out of shape over the episode and decided the
whole mess was a deliberate attack on
</P>
<P>
   minorities and gays. Even after the excrement turned out to be
chocolate cake
</P>
<P>
   with sprinkles.
</P>
<P>
   Support groups soon gathered on campus to share ``feelings of
violation'' and
</P>
<P>
   ``vulnerability.'' They cried together as the director of the
Center spoke of the
</P>
<P>
   healing process that would have to take place, harking back 10
years to similar incidents including a reminder of the criticism
one student incurred because her boyfriend wore a dress.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't have support groups when I was in school, which could
explain why I'm ignorant of the appeal of everybody getting in a
heap and wailing. We did have friends though and we'd complain
until they were sick of listening. Sometimes we told our parents
what was on our minds, but not often because our contrite
confessions frequently had a way of jumping and biting us.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we didn't have any big problems back then, although all of
the elements were there. We had death and we had single-parent
households. There was booze
</P>
<P>
   and cigarettes and even a dope seller at one of the after-school
hangouts. Most
</P>
<P>
   of us just chose not to go there.
</P>
<P>
   And none of us (that I knew of) had a boyfriend who wore
dresses. If we had, we'd probably just have dealt with it even
though it could have gotten a little ugly around prom time arguing
over who was going to wear the corsage.
</P>
<P>
   Once a month, our high school sorority used to have a thing we
called ``Rat Court'' where the sisters sat around in a circle and
griped. ``My eyebrows are
</P>
<P>
   growing together!'' Collective moan of compassion. ``My
boyfriend is a troll.''
</P>
<P>
   Group groan of recognition. When it was over and everyone was
feeling a whole
</P>
<P>
   lot better, we'd pull up our bobby socks and boogie on to the
next crisis.
</P>
<P>
   A few years back I knew a lady who had a support group for
everything including the time her Dalmatian refused to stop pooping
on the Persian (carpet). Eventually, she married a man she had met
at one of her meetings. It didn't work out though and six weeks
later they divorced. Seems marriage caused to many conflicts in the
scheduling of their various ``groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. I'm not suggesting that a lot of folks don't
need a lot of help. The numbers of drivers I see on the highways
delivering middle-finger salutes to fellow travelers would attest
to the fact that they do indeed need to talk over their troubles
with someone. But on occasion I suspect we're all getting just a
little silly with our whining.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad everyone can't be normal like me...like me...like me.

 &HT;    Spending less means you've started saving
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For many of us, the holidays bring spiritual exaltation,
emotional fatigue and economic prostration.
</P>
<P>
   We spend everything we can. We charge the rest. We begin to
wonder not how we can ever get ahead in our financial lives but how
we can just catch up.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, getting ahead is not that hard. What you have to
do to get started is to save money. That's not overwhelmingly hard,
either. What's hard is making yourself do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is full of trade-offs, and getting rich is no
exception,'' writes University of Georgia business professor Dwight
R. Lee. ``You can spend everything you earn now and have nothing
later. Or you can choose how to spend wisely, knowing that by
spending a little less today you can spend a whole lot more
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee and co-author Richard B. McKenzie tell us that in their
recently published book, ``Getting Rich in America: Eight Simple
Rules for Building a Fortune and a Satisfying Life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people can save more than they do, far more in many
cases, by resisting temptations to buy things that add little
satisfaction to their lives,'' the professors write.
</P>
<P>
   Success comes from realizing two things, they add. First, there
are plenty of things we can do without, or do with less of. Second,
we can save surprising amounts of money from modest but regular
investments. The accompanying illustration gives some examples.
</P>
<P>
   The authors do, indeed, pay attention to emotional as well as
financial satisfaction. ``Resisting temptation establishes a sense
of self-control that is an integral part of any satisfying life,''
Lee and McKenzie observe. ``It is summoning the strength to take
control of your choices and choosing wisely and deliberately,
rather than responding to things like a feather in the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some practical techniques for achieving that
satisfaction:
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't think about saving as a sacrifice. ``There is a sense of
security that comes from saving and investing,'' the professors
say. ``The value of that comfort is best appreciated by comparing
it with the mental anxiety that comes from constantly being in
financial distress.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Pay yourself first. Everybody says that, over and over again,
because it is true. When you sit down to pay the bills, make one of
the payments to a savings or investment account.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter if you start with a very small amount, even
$10 a week. The point is to make saving a part of your economic
habits. You can increase your periodic savings as you get pay
raises or bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use automatic savings plans. You can set up payroll deductions
to a credit union, for example, or automatic transfers from your
checking account to a savings account. For many people, it's easier
to save if the money never shows up in their regular spending
channels.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pay off your consumer debts. Credit card debt typically costs
15 percent to 18 percent a year in interest. That's money you could
be putting to good use.
</P>
<P>
   If you are overloaded with holiday debts, set up a reasonable
plan for paying a big chunk every month. Some people keep a running
record of their debt repayments in their wallet or purse, as a
reminder of the progress they are making.
</P>
<P>
   You might also consider switching to credit card accounts that
charge lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get rid of credit cards. That will reduce your temptation, or
at least make it harder to give in. It's harder to let go of cash
than it is to sign a bill on your credit card.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reduce your routine spending. If you keep a notebook with you
and record each expenditure for a month or two, you will begin to
spot expensive and perhaps frivolous spending habits.
</P>
<P>
   _ Take advantage of retirement savings plans. If you have a
401(k) plan at work, contributions you make are not subject to
income tax. That's a nice bonus.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, most employers will match a portion of your
contribution. The typical plan adds as much as 3 percent of your
income when you make contributions. That's a freebie.
</P>
<P>
   Individual retirement accounts are another way of getting some
extra oomph in your savings plan. Anyone with earned income can put
up to $2,000 a year in an IRA. In some circumstances, contributions
to a traditional IRA are not subject to income tax. The earnings of
your IRA investments are not subject to tax until you withdraw the
money. In a Roth IRA, you pay taxes on your contributions now, but
you escape income taxes entirely when you start withdrawing your
money on retirement.

 &HT;    Rocks in glass House: With moral pontification, hypocrisy is in
like Flynt
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ If history is what Saturday's vote was about _
reaping inch-high headlines and making Bill Clinton a heel mark in
our nation's annals _ the president's pursuers made it.
</P>
<P>
   But when, before the vote, House Speaker-to-be Bob Livingston
resigned over admissions of philandery, it guaranteed that
history-book accounts of this inmpeachment would include the
subsequent phrase from New York Congressman Jerrold Nadler:
``sexual McCarthyism.''
</P>
<P>
   Nadler, a Democrat, was saying it was wrong for Livingston to
resign. House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, next to Kenneth Starr
Clinton's most merciless pursuer, choked back tears at the
microphone.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay swiveled toward the Democrats when he said, ``for some it
is no longer good enough to make a mistake, confess a mistake and
accept the consequences,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The implication was the Dems had set up Livingston for disgrace.
Actually, history will show it was the Republican leaders in the
House who did _ with Larry Flynt's help, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The Hustler publisher had come up with the goods on Livingston
simply by offering a little walking-around cash for anyone who'd
slept with anyone who'd sit in judgment of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   And why? Maybe Flynt was furious that Congress had cut into his
porn empire: All that secret, raw grand jury testimony on TV; every
smutty comma of Ken Starr's evidentiary report pumped onto the
internet and into paperbacks. Starr's tax-subsidized wares had
monopolized the reading-viewing of Flynt's core constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Any mercantile captain will understand: Who'll buy your porn if
government supplies it?
</P>
<P>
   Amid all this, House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt could not
have been more eloquent. He pegged Saturday's events as: ``Life
imitates farce.''
</P>
<P>
   For a moment as Gephardt spoke, encouraging unanimity reigned.
When he said Livingston should not resign, he got applause from
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   When he called the resignation a ``terrible capitulation to the
negative forces that are consuming our political system and our
country,'' he got applause from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   But when Gephardt urged Congress at last to ``say no to vicious
self-righteousness,'' hands on the right-hand side of the aisle
suddenly forsook applause. Ties needed straightening. Dandruff
needed dusting.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, Clinton has disgraced himself. He put his
presidency and his agenda at risk. He hurt his country and the
people he loves, and he undermined the causes that matter to him
and his supporters. Resignation would have been merciful. So why
haven't the majority of Americans been calling for it? Maybe it's
because they are similarly repulsed by the tactics and rhetoric of
his pursuers' six-year war to negate their vote.
</P>
<P>
   The pursuers long have wondered why the ``character'' issue
wouldn't fly. This is why. If Clinton is a draft dodger, so are
high-profile detractors who managed, just like him, to avoid
Vietnam. Indeed, they include ``war wimps'' (that means you, Rush)
who pounded the drums for war but plied deferment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's fund-raising has demeaned his office. No excuse. What
were the Reagan-Bush excuses for ``breakfast club'' cash grabs and
galas to fund an undeclared war in Central America?
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton blew campaign finance laws out of the water, the
Federal Election Commission noticed the same of the GOP. Indeed,
its staffers found the Dole campaign $10 million more at fault.
</P>
<P>
   And as the evidence has accumulated about Clinton's womanizing,
the unwashed masses couldn't help but notice _ actually they
deduced it from the start _ that he was not Capitol Hill's only
alley cat.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't excuse Clinton. It does explain why history's heel
mark will be a blot both for the pursued and the pursuer.

 &HT;    HEALTH BRIEFS: Multiple births can carry deadly danger for
babies
 &HT;    (Eds: A compilation of health stories that moved from Cox News
Service in the past week.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Infertility treatments are becoming easier to take and more
popular, and multiple births are becoming more common, doctors say.
But their frequency doesn't diminish their danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is one baby,'' says Kaylen Silverberg, a physician
with the Texas Fertility Center in Austin, Texas. Any other outcome
is deemed less than successful, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But like Bobbi McCaughey, the Iowa woman who gave birth to the
first set of live septuplets in the United States last year, Nkem
Chukwu had more than one baby in part because of the fertility
drugs she was taking.
</P>
<P>
   Fertility drugs, which come in both pill and injectable forms,
stimulate the production of eggs in the ovaries and greatly
increase the chances of getting pregnant. Typically, women will
take the drugs for 8 to 12 days in a row, injecting themselves at
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're using fertility drugs and you get eight fetuses,
it's not a success at the beginning,'' says Margaret Thompson, an
obstetrician at Renaissance Women's Group in Austin. ``In fact, I
think that would be viewed by most of us _ I hate to say failure _
it's not the desired result of fertility treatments. In most cases,
you would lose these fetuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say any babies born as small and as early as the Chukwu
octuplets face several threats to their survival. Their lungs will
struggle to function and could be injured by the machines used to
support them. Blood vessels deep in the babies' brains are fragile
and could spontaneously rupture, leading to serious neurological
problems, such as mental retardation and cerebral palsy. And their
intestinal tracts could become infected, causing inflammation of
the bowels. With the additional risk of infection, the octuplets
will need around-the-clock attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite everybody's best intention, you just can't do as good
a job of taking care of that many babies as you can with a lesser
numbers of babies,'' says Todd Scharnberg, chief of neonatology for
the Seton HealthCare Network in Austin. ``It's a huge concern,
because dealing with one baby at that gestation is a difficult
problem. Dealing with three or four or six or eight would strain
the capabilities of any intensive care unit in this country and
just make it more difficult to take care of the babies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are drugs you can give for these premature babies to
reduce the respiratory distress syndrome, to mature their lungs,''
said Dr. Joe Massey of Reproductive Biology Associates of Atlanta,
the state's largest infertility clinic. ``But it can only be
incompletely effective at this stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Massey predicts problems are more likely with the Chukwu
octuplets than with the McCaughey septuplets, born 13 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the McCaugheys' success has encouraged some mothers
to be more confident about multiple pregnancies, Massey said.
</P>
<P>
   Reproductive Biology patients deliver twins at least monthly and
triplets five to 10 times a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there still are occasional losses of triplets,'' Massey
added, pointing out that Nkem Chukwu, who conceived via fertility
drugs, miscarried triplets earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Food a major source of holiday comfort and joy
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's not necessarily the family and friends that make
you feel so good during holiday celebrations _ it could be the
food.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday meals are a particularly strong concoction of
stimulants, sedatives and chemical aphrodisiacs. And between large
portions _ the average meal can contain up to 4,500 calories _ and
a heavy leaning toward carbohydrates, the traditional Christmas
feast can be a boon to diners' bodies and moods.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're power-packing all the nutrient supplies in your body,''
said Kathleen Zelman, a dietitian. ``But let it be an occasional
indulgence because along with all those nutrients, come a lot of
excess calories.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, about a third of a traditional turkey holiday
meal is made up of carbohydrates, another 30 percent in protein,
and another 35 percent in fat, Zelman said.
</P>
<P>
   Carbohydrates, found in the desserts, rolls and the cranberry
sauce, can raise the levels of serotonin in the brain. Serotonin is
an organic compound that at high doses gives a sense of calm and
well-being, according to Mitchell Ghen, a doctor of osteopathy at
the Atlanta Institute of Anti-Aging and Chronic Disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stimulate the part of the brain that makes you feel kind
of good, kind of relaxed,'' he said. ``That's why Christmas is so
hard, because everyone is giving out the carbohydrates of the best
kind _ Godivas and the like.''
</P>
<P>
   Other stimulants lead to a sense of joy; from caffeine, found in
coffee and soda, to theobromine, found in chocolate. ``All that
caffeine consumption is like putting your foot on the gas pedal and
taking it to the floor board of the car,'' said Ghen. ``It might be
fun, but in the end, it can be pretty wearing on the body.''
Theobromine, similar to caffeine in its effect, is a diuretic and a
smooth muscle relaxant.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists working to change genetic makeup of mosquito
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Scientists in Texas and elsewhere are working to
change the genetic makeup of a malaria-causing mosquito whose bite
kills nearly 3 million people a year worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to build a benign mosquito is considered a scientific
long shot, but the stakes are enormous. As many as 500 million
people a year in tropical Mexico, Central and South American,
Africa and Asia are infected by the Anopheles mosquitoes, according
to the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making progress quicker than we thought we could,'' said
Greg Lanzaro, a medical entomologist at the University of Texas'
Center for Tropical Diseases in Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to recent genetic advances and a discovery by Lanzaro,
some mosquito project scientists say the effort might move out of
the laboratory and into the field by 2003, 15 years sooner than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say if altering mosquito genes to prevent the bugs
from spreading malaria worked in Africa, where Anopheles gambiae _
one of about 60 species of the mosquitoes _ carries the deadliest
form of the disease, the remedy could be swiftly shifted to the
Americas and to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Success not only would eliminate a scourge that's plagued
humanity for thousands of years, but could lead to similar
campaigns against other insects that spread killer diseases such as
yellow fever and dengue.
</P>
<P>
   A major challenge of making Anopheles mosquitoes benign is not
only to find genes to prevent them from transmitting the parasite
that causes malaria, but a mechanism to insure that the
anti-parasite genes can be spread widely among their offspring,
such as transplanting a gene from a mouse's immune system into
Anopheles gambiae to make proteins to kill the parasites. Others
are trying to figure out why the mosquito's immune system doesn't
attack the parasite, and find ways to force it to.

 &HT;    'Anonymous angels' helps Ohio woman
 &HT;    By Dale Huffman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ During this holiday season, Martie Davis said she
is experiencing the joy of being touched by ``anonymous angels.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually I have this special feeling that is hard to put into
words. It's like these angels are picking me up under my arms and
carrying me through so many of my life challenges,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, 50, works for the Combined Health District of Montgomery
County. She said her husband Jim, 51, suffers from ``terminal and
very advanced liver disease, and is homebound.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis added, ``I have been fighting hepatitis, but now I am able
to work. The thing is that few people knew about our family's
medical and financial problems. I just don't complain about things.
I may have said something sometime about how it would be a pretty
bleak Christmas for our daughter.'' Their daughter, Lorena, was 15
on Sunday, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Financial concerns made a nice turn around about two weeks ago
for Davis when she found an envelope in her mailbox at work.
``There were five $20 bills inside,'' she said. ``There was no note
with the money. And whoever had written my name on the envelope
tried to obscure the handwriting.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, on two more occasions in recent days, envelopes have
mysteriously been left in her mailbox, with her name on them, each
holding $100.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said she has no idea who is responsible for helping her
with the $300.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been adopted by these anonymous angels, and it means my
daughter will have Christmas after all. And I can make things nicer
for my husband. It shows that people really care about others and
that they don't always do nice things to get publicity,'' Davis
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I feel like I want to thank those responsible for this
quiet support. It is amazing. We were down, but now my family will
make it because someone cares. This is what they mean when they
talk about Christmas miracles.''

 &HT;    Why the sad, crazy act of binge drinking will never end
 &HT;    By Hank Stuever
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Let's start with singing drunks. Here is Amanda
and here is Vanessa, sitting on the piano, in a barful of singing
drunks. Amanda is wearing a long, black skirt that is slit all the
way up her thigh. Vanessa has on a tight, powder-blue T-shirt and
bell-bottom jeans. Here, also, are the Four Killeen Guys, keeping
the world safe for hockey haircuts, singing along with the piano
player, ``You've Lost that Loving Feeling,'' a song that singing
drunks associate with ``Top Gun,'' a great movie for drunks,
testosteronic and sonic and moronic, feeling the need for speed,
highway to the danger zone, the love anthem by the Righteous
Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Piano bars are for binge drunks. The beery and varnished and
Polo-cologne smell of it all, wedged shoulder to shoulder in the
Ivory Cat Tavern at 300 E. Sixth St.on a chilly December Friday
night. Listen to the awful, awful songs that we love so much, when
we're drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Walk in and find a seat, andthey're all sing-shouting Bob
Seger's ``Turn the Page.'' Then they sing ``Santa Claus Is Coming
to Town.'' Then they sing ``Amarillo by Morning.'' ``I need a
volunteer, a female one,'' shouts the piano player, Kenny Luna, a
cheese log in a blazer, summa cum laude from Lounge Singer U. ``Who
wants a free drink? Make some noise.'' The drunks scream and wave
their hands. He needs a volunteer to stand behind him and hold his
harmonica. He is going to play ``Piano Man.'' The Four Killeen Guys
offer up one of their women, vault her onto the stage. ``It's a
so-so crowd for Friday,'' he sings, mangling the lyrics for fun.
``It's a kick-ass crowd for a Friday ...'' And they holler and sing
back, ``La da-diddy-da. La da-diddy-da-aa-aa-ah,'' and he gives the
woman volunteer the signal to put the harmonica in front of his
mouth and what can he possibly be thinking, deep down, except look
at all the drunks making me sing ``Piano Man'' again. The volunteer
wins a free tequila shot and the crowd erupts for her to drink it.
``Drink! Drink! Drink! ... ''
</P>
<P>
   A long time ago I gave up drinking like this (I get drunk so
differently now, so much more slowly), and maybe you gave it up,
too. It doesn't matter how long it's been, when you walk in you
feel it going on around you, you smell it. Binge drinking smells
like it always did.
</P>
<P>
   The angry drunks
</P>
<P>
   ``What the hell are you looking at?'' says one boy in an
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch ball cap to another boy in an Abercrombie &AMP;
Fitch ball cap, but a bouncer _ the ever-present, self-important
street steak in a black T-shirt _ gets in the five or so feet
between them, gives them both the bouncer-look, as if to say, hey,
guys, simmer down, we've all got nice ball caps, we're all young
and drunk here in the land of Never Too Much. ``Dollar wells,
dollar drafts, dollar-fifty shots,'' yells a doorman, like a chant.
</P>
<P>
   What the hell are we ever looking at, on Sixth Street _ the
tourism jewel of Austin _ if not the drunks? The free show, the
tastelessness, the rowdy anger of the overserved. Drunks,
interrupted
</P>
<P>
   She watches while the police officer makes her boyfriend stand
on one foot.
</P>
<P>
   Put the right foot out, the hokeypokey of Friday nights. Oops,
he slips. (You were sort of rooting for him. Ace the test, dude,
and win the right to get back in the car.)
</P>
<P>
   ``How are we going to get home?'' she whines loudly. The Sixth
Street crowd watches her boyfriend go away in handcuffs. There are
many exclamations of the word ``dude,'' in both sympathetic and
taunting inflections. It's boozer foxhole mentality: ``Dude'' says
Poor sucker and ``dude'' says Better him than me. ``Dude, he's had
like, six beers at least,'' says one onlooker, who is enjoying the
misery of it. ``He's gonna be hurtin'. They tow your car, you gotta
pay bail, you gotta go to court. I mean, do the math.''
</P>
<P>
   Drunks say ``do the math'' all the time now. It's a trendy line,
like ``show me the money'' was a couple years ago. Have a cigar and
do the math. Do the math for drunks and make sure you get yourself
on the lucky side of the equal sign.
</P>
<P>
   Studying drunks
</P>
<P>
   Do this math. The notoriously no-fun Centers for Disease Control
and the U.S. Surgeon General's Office and the National
Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information, who seem to always
be releasing studies, all define binge drinking as having more than
five drinks in a row (four for you, ladies), on more than two
nights a week. More algebraically, you can define ``problem''
imbibing as 10 drinks a week in any order. Ten a week? Translation,
or equal sign: We're all drunks.
</P>
<P>
   The overworked office assistant having margaritas after work,
griping and drinking, is bingeing. Or the bottle of wine opened
while waiting for water to boil for the pasta, followed by the next
bottle of wine with the pasta: It's classy with the lights low, but
whosoever drinks of it to the bottom is bingeing. Grownups are
binge drinkers _ even the grownups who are non-Sixth Streeters,
non-lap dance receivers, non-gay bar queens. We binge at the
mention of football. We binge whenever we hear it's free.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly we are reminded of this when someone dies in a
drunk-driving car wreck that is, by some evocative detail (baby) or
plot point (Christmas Eve) or level of gore (duration of road
closure divided by number of lanes closed), deemed more sad than
all the ones recently detonated before it. There is tsk-tsking, as
if hearing about somebody stepping on avoidable, clearly marked
land mines.
</P>
<P>
   When a college kid drinks himself to death (it happens about 12
times a year, nationally), especially if he was in a
gender-restricted organization that includes secret peer-group
spankings as an unofficial fringe benefit, then the admonishing
finger really wags. People drink themselves to death all the time
in this town, mostly people who take 30 or 40 years of drinking to
do so, instead of one night. (People drink themselves to death
plainly on the sidewalk in front of your Starbucks every day of the
year, when you think about it.)
</P>
<P>
   But aren't fraternity boys America's binge-iest drinkers, at
least in our drinking lore? For who else, in the modern era, has so
rambunctiously stepped up to the piano?
</P>
<P>
   A recent autopsy report by the Travis County Medical Examiner's
Office of Jack Lyndon Ivey Jr., a 23-year old son of a Plano doctor
and a member of the Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity at the University of
Texas, shows he had a 0.4 percent blood-alcohol level when he died
on Nov. 11 on the floor of his apartment on West 25th Street, right
in the boozy, populated middle of Binge Drinkingland. Ivey's
roommate apparently thought he was sleeping it off all day. The
university is still investigating the death to see to what extent,
if any, groupthink and other peer pressure played out that night.
(A school night, the city's mother-conscience would add.) He or
someone else had scrawled Greek-looking alphas and epsilons in
black marker pen on his torso and the sole of his left foot, his
thighs. There was residue from tape around his wrists.
</P>
<P>
   Zero-point-four is a profound level of alcohol in the body. It
is nearly a dozen more drinks ``off the chart'' past the
``potential health risk'' of the 11-drink limit for a man who,
measured and weighed in the morgue, was 69 inches tall and 195 1/2
Pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Off the chart. Remember the chart? Anyone who ever went to
college or a prom has seen the chart, which is posted on almost any
counseling office bulletin board. (It is always on the wrong
bulletin board; it is never tacked above the men's room urinating
trough.)
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's School of Public Health, clearly and fussily
concerned, did this math four years ago, to much acclaim and
organizing of anti-drinking crusades: Twelve million undergraduates
drink around 4 billion cans of beer a year, the report said,
averaging 55 six-packs per undergrad. Annually, they spend $446 on
alcoholic beverages, which was, it was also noted, more than they
paid for textbooks and Diet Cokes combined.
</P>
<P>
   And yet no one stopped. They'll never stop. The studies and
coalitions pile on top of one another: One study suggests that
21-and-over drinking laws actually increased binge drinking.
Another suggests that fewer teen-agers are drinking today than
teen-agers who drank 10 years ago, only with a punch line: The ones
who are drinking now are drinking more.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, two dozen Boston-area colleges and universities
announced a new battle plan to confront binge drinking. They'll
have seminars and rules and pamphlets and the students will exhibit
only a surface intention of stopping. Just like the grown-ups, like
history. In this century we have looked at our drinking and
confronted it in several ways: Prohibition brought ruin and
shootouts; Just Say No brought youth groups and pizza parties.
``We're not looking to come down on young people like a ton of
bricks here,'' the president of Boston's Northeastern University
said. ``We're looking to educate them to take a more adult and
mature stance toward behavior that may have been acceptable 30 or
40 years ago, but no longer is because a lot has changed and the
consequences of drinking are far scarier.''
</P>
<P>
   Something else is behind binge drinking, something seminars
don't cover: It is fun.
</P>
<P>
   Fun drunks!
</P>
<P>
   Because you forgot how spectacularly hilarious you are. (And
smart.)
</P>
<P>
   Because you forgot how sexy it feels.
</P>
<P>
   Because you forgot how hard we laughed when you fell off of that
street- light pole. (Why were you climbing that pole anyway? I
can't remember.)
</P>
<P>
   Because when you drink a lot of drinks all at once, you become a
singer. And a dancer. And how thoughtful of them to put Aretha's
``Respect'' on at just this moment. The world changes after five
drinks: People want to hear you sing.
</P>
<P>
   Because it's not about work anymore, or exams, or the little
arguments, or the NASDAQ.
</P>
<P>
   Because it's about how much I really, really love you. You more
than anyone else. Really. I'm not just shaying that.
</P>
<P>
   Exemplary non-drunk: George W. Bush
</P>
<P>
   Lately, we seem obsessed with just how much George W. Bush drank
in college, and after. This is thus far the sole skeletal anything
in his potentially presidential closet, at least anything
interesting, that has to do with Who He Is. Until his last sip 12
years ago, drinking excessively was Dubya's vice, which he is
careful to distinguish from alcoholism. He is candid to reporters
about the ritual of it, the boys-will-be-boys storyboard of
fraternal Yale drunkdom, the missing years, the life-changing
resolve to not be a drunk again. And how well it's working for him,
this fun un-partying gubernatorial go-go-go.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston plastic surgeon, Gregory Gallico, told the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram last month that he and Bush and the other Delta Kappa
Epsilon brothers at Yale ``Drank a ton in college. It was
absolutely off the wall. It was appalling. I cannot for the life of
me figure out how we all made it through.''
</P>
<P>
   In GQ magazine, over a non-alcoholic beer, Bush said: ``I had
more than my fill of the real stuff. Ask the guys who used to hang
with me back then. It wasn't pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't pretty, but hasn't the governor always struck us as
the kind of guy who wouldn't want to ruin a party? You can't
envision him walking into corporate parties or political galas _
these glorious times we live in _ and frowning, asking that the
metaphorical keg, mostly champagne flutes and name-brand longnecks
these days, be put away. He is our favorite frat brother. He's done
the math and it didn't equate for him, but ya'll go on ahead.
</P>
<P>
   A toast, a prayer
</P>
<P>
   Last call. You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here.
Stand sometime in the middle of the Sixth Street around 2 o'clock
in the morning, sober if you can. Stand there, especially if it's
been a thousand years since you left college or had a fake ID.
Understand that binge drinking is a club that can never fully be
disbanded, and you belong even if you stopped drinking long after
any of the characters say ``Hi, Bob!''
</P>
<P>
   A toast, a prayer: To the battling Abercrombie boys and the
singing gals in the split skirts; to the woman who has just fallen
off her bar stool at Treasure Island; to the kids still hoping to
get into Bob Popular; to the officers out there busting them for
fake IDs; to the band (badly) playing a Cure cover song in Maggie
Mae's, and to all the people wildly dancing to it; to everyone who
has to say, at some point tonight, ``No, I'm not drunk,'' and then
has to say, ``Well, OK, I'm a little bit drunk.'' To all the
mothers who spend their Friday nights praying. To the researchers
at the Harvard School of Public Health, and the coalitions and task
forces. To the screaming girls. To the hollering boys. To the face
in the mirror, what the hell are you lookin' at? Oh, and to the
vomiters out there, whose bodies are telling them they've had
plenty for tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Sir, step out of the car . . .
</P>
<P>
   The night ends perfectly when I get in the car, drive about 100
feet, and get pulled over by the police. The red-and-blue lights
flashing in the rear-view mirror, the stellar brightness. Yes,
officer. How much have I had to drink?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, officer. Honest. (In the land of Never Too Much I only
watch the drunks, for a night anyway. I had a Diet Coke.)
</P>
<P>
   But there I am, shivering on the sidewalk, doing the best Friday
night hokeypokey I have ever done. Right foot out.

 &HT;    Flower show uplifting roots
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_The Southeastern Flower Show has a nice problem: It's
outgrown its container.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, the region's largest juried horticultural event plans
to move from its home in Midtown's City Hall East Exhibition Center
to the Atlanta Exposition Center, south of downtown at I-285 and
Jonesboro Road.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be people who'll say, `Don't take it out of
town,' but when we move to the Perimeter, it also will help
surrounding counties feel like they can get there easier,'' said
Doug Moody, the show's director.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which benefits the Atlanta Botanical Garden, has long
sought more space than the 133,000 square feet it rents at City
Hall East, where the next exhibition will be held Feb. 17-21.
Parking also is a problem in the neighborhood, between Ponce de
Leon and North avenues, because of redevelopment activity.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Expo Center, known for its Scott Antique Market,
offers an additional 30,000 square feet and more than two acres of
parking. The extra room will provide more space for selling garden
products _ a large revenue producer _ and for expanding exhibits
and competitions, said Moody, who expects to complete an agreement
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Though the show is a regional one, drawing 20 percent of its
visitors from outside the metro area, the event is considered a
local treasure, said Susan Mendheim, president and CEO of the
Midtown Alliance business association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hate to see any important event like the flower show leave
the central area, whether it's downtown, Midtown or Buckhead,'' she
said. ``We plan to (look into) this because there are other
exhibitions that have special requirements like them that we are
losing to facilities outside the city.''
</P>
<P>
   In its case, the flower show requires a facility for two weeks,
allowing time to set up before the five-day event opens. That much
rent can be expensive, Moody said.
</P>
<P>
   Leasing the new space over the next five years will cost about
the same as it does for City Hall East, he said, declining to be
specific. But the show expects to incur an additional $20,000 in
expenses for marketing the new location and for storage.
</P>
<P>
   This year's attendance, at 35,000, was off from previous shows,
so for the 1999 event organizers have secured a marketing coup _ a
rarely shown display of Disney topiaries from the Epcot
International Flower and Garden Festival at Walt Disney World
Resort. Mickey Mouse and 16 other Disney favorites, towering more
than 10 feet, will greet visitors inside a specially designed
2,700-square-foot facility built outside City Hall East. Volunteers
plan to spend several days plugging thousands of carnations and
greenery into the forms, which are mechanized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will be mobbed this year because of Disney,'' show
Chairman Pat Tuff said.

 &HT;    Tangled history of the tango begins in brothels of South America
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It was my first tango lesson, and I
wasn't holding instructor Emily Jo Russo with the proper arrogance
of a flashing-eyed South American rake.
</P>
<P>
   She gently disengaged and said: ``In tango, the man is dominant.
He dictates his partner's moves, and she must follow to please
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Please me? I was already thrilled to think someone could tinge
my porridge-sodden, Scots-Irish soul with any amount of tango.
</P>
<P>
   One thing I never understood is why tango dancers look so
hostile. So I asked Russo, the dance director of Maloney's Dance
Sport U.S.A. in Delray Beach: Is tango the Latin version of makeup
(after you break up) sex?
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn-born Italian-American explained that indeed, there
is a subtext of anger and alienation to the dance. I was keen to
learn this _ and fast _ because my introduction to tango soon would
be followed by a second lesson from Miriam Larici, a cast member of
Forever Tango, which begins a two-week run at the Royal Poinciana
Playhouse today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tango came out of the bordellos of South America,'' Russo
explained. ``In the late 1800s, thousands of impoverished European
men left their families in Italy, France, and Spain to work in the
meatpacking industry of South America.''
</P>
<P>
   Denied the companionship of women, nights would find these men
drinking cheap wine and singing songs of their homelands.
Loneliness drove them to the fleshpots.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the bordellos,'' Russo continued, ``they would find
passion, but a sadness in the fleeting physical act of love. There
was lust, but with it, anger and alienation. These themes emerge in
the tango.''
</P>
<P>
   Wow. So, if I understood, lonely, angry men went to the
bordellos for dance lessons?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, that's not it, entirely,'' she said patiently. She
explained that single, lonely men developed the dance among
themselves _ and then took it to the bordellos.
</P>
<P>
   Men tangoing with men? I could see how a man reduced to dancing
the night away with drunken gauchos might become testy. Now I
understood the visits to the brothel.
</P>
<P>
   That Renalto, he reeks of the pampas and cannot tango for sour
manzanas. When he raked me with his spurs, I struck him with my
quirt. That's him sulking in the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Russo said we'd better return to the dance floor for a basic
tango lesson because Larici's plane from Mexico had landed, and the
performer was expected momentarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can teach you a basic gringo tango step,'' she said, ``but I
don't think an American can experience tango. It must come from the
blood, the soul. I have that soul.''
</P>
<P>
   I said I would try not to get oatmeal on her soul and that if
she could show me a couple of gringo steps, that would be fine.
</P>
<P>
   She taught me a sideways walking step punctuated by the right
toe hooking the left heel, followed by a side step-and-close, then
several aggressive forward steps. (OK, so Groucho Marx looked
better pumping Margaret Dumont across the floor, but still it was
neat.)
</P>
<P>
   Then, during a pause, Russo warned me not to move. She spun
behind me, executed a deft back kick between my legs, then lunged
into my body, her thigh entwining my own, and slid langorously down
to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was that murderous little kick that just missed my
groinal area?'' I gasped.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gancho _ the hook,'' she smiled.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, Larici arrived and, in excellent English, recapped
the dance's South American origins, adding to what I had learned
from Russo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is much sad feeling in the tango,'' the Argentinian
said. I took her in my arms and attempted a vacant look that
bespoke nights in the reeking abattoirs of Montevideo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the instrument is sad, the bandoneon, an accordion
brought over from Germany,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And then we did the gringo tango. Not well on my part. Even so,
Larici was muy agradable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were taught well.''
</P>
<P>
   I nodded gratefully in Russo's direction.
</P>
<P>
   But alas, my follow-the-pictures-on-the-floor technique left
little room for Larici to improvise. I released her and took up my
notebook.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the underclass association, tango was frowned upon by
South American society, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Only after the scandalous dance migrated to France, where it
raged in Paris nightclubs, and then returned, clothed in French
approval, did South Americans claim it as their own.
</P>
<P>
   I wondered if Larici and Russo would favor me with a
demonstration. Con mucho gusto! With Russo leading, the women moved
together like a polished duo, and, for the first time, I saw the
slides, the langorous glides, the crisp ganchos, the smoldering
gazes, the caressing leg embraces, all executed entirely without
gringoness.
</P>
<P>
   I was hooked. Or ganchoed _ however you want to say it.

 &HT;    Swiss firm chosen to design UT art museum
 &HT;    By Michael Barnes
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Casting across the Atlantic for an architect to
design its $40 million art museum, the University of Texas has
chosen the enterprising Swiss firm of Herzog &AMP; de Meuronto plan its
new Blanton Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for somebody with a great deal of museum
experience and very high standards,'' said UT President Larry
Faulkner. ``(Jacques) Herzog and his partners are very well suited
to this project.''
</P>
<P>
   Known for austere yet tactile buildings that serve the pragmatic
needs of their owners, Herzog &AMP; de Meuron designed the recent
extension of the Tate Gallery of Modern Art in London, as well as
museums and galleries in France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The Blanton, scheduled to open in late 2002 at the intersection
of Speedway and Martin Luther King Boulevard, will be the firm's
first museum project in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a place for dialogue about art,'' said Jacques
Herzog, the most public member of the firm, based in Basel,
Switzerland. ``It will not be elitist.''
</P>
<P>
   Herzog's best-known American building, designed with business
partner Pierre de Meuron, is a winery of enmeshed rocks in
California's Napa Valley. It won high praise from international
critics and this week was named one of Time magazine's 10 Best of
1998 Design.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal was to find an architect with creative methods and a
willingness to collaborate,'' said Jack S. Blanton, the former UT
regent and head of the Houston Endowment. ``We have found precisely
these qualities.''
</P>
<P>
   The Houston foundation gave $12 million to the museum, and since
then, the Blanton family has pledged an additional $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The new building will showcase UT's respected collections of
20th century American and Latin American art, its encyclopedic set
of prints and drawings, and the recently acquired $35 million
Suida-Manning collection of Old Masters.
</P>
<P>
   Currently split between two campus locations _ the Art Building
to the east and the bottom floors of the Ransom Center to the west
_ the Blanton collections will sit southwest of the Jester
Dormitory and across Martin Luther King Boulevard from the planned
Texas State History Museum. Speedway will be closed and rerouted to
an exit astride the multistory garage southeast of Jester.
</P>
<P>
   Herzog wants to capitalize on the odd angles of the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a site that needed a building more than this
one,'' he said. ``It will not be just a box. It will have open
spaces, public spaces and possibly a walk-through.''
</P>
<P>
   UT planners see the museum as a gateway, encouraging the flow of
pedestrian traffic to and from campus. Herzog has already suggested
making the museum a true entryway by routing walkers through the
building, or more likely, through a museum courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great opportunity to make this museum the hinge
between the university and the city,'' Faulkner said.
</P>
<P>
   On previous visits to Austin, Herzog has expressed interest in
the way Texans have used brick, stone, terra cotta and especially
the tiles that decorate some older UT buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel as if there is almost a South American influence
here,'' Herzog said. ``It has to do with the very hot climate. We
can deal with that through canopies and courtyards with water and
light filtering through.''
</P>
<P>
   UT's building advisory committee, which included Architecture
Dean Lawrence Speck, recommended Herzog's firm as early as August,
but the selection required the approval of Faulkner and Chancellor
William Cunningham, along with the completion of business
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Speck, who was particularly impressed with Herzog's design for
the Dominus Estate winery in California, supported the selec- tion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They create an architecture of substance and timelessness, not
just of the moment,'' Speck said.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss firm will collaborate with Booziotis &AMP; Co. of Dallas,
responsible for the Hamon expansion of the Dallas Museum of Art and
the exhibition pavilion for the Margaret and Trammell Crow
Collection of Asian Art in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to get a sensational museum,'' said Bill
Booziotis. ``It will be appropriate for the campus, but it will
based on classic ideas, not fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, UT has raised $37 million toward its original $42
million goal to build and endow the Blanton, although some
observers suggest that the final price could go higher.
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner said the museum might not rise all at once, but he
wanted a full design from Herzog soon.
</P>
<P>
   Across town at the Austin Museum of Art, contract negotiations
are still under way with New York-based architect Richard Gluckman,
who will design the municipal museum, either on West Third Street
or West Fourth Street, depending on the outcome of a proposed
development deal that would include a new City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it means we'll have two great museums and two great
works of architecture in the city,'' said Elizabeth Ferrer,
director of the Austin Museum of Art. ``People will start looking
at Austin as a destination, in the way that they look at Houston as
one today.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrer said that Gluckman, who designed museums in Santa Fe, New
York and elsewhere, plans to stay in touch with Herzog, but that
the two buildings will be very different. ``The Blanton is going to
be a contemporary building, but one that fits into the rest of
campus,'' said Blanton director Jessie Hite. ``People from all over
the world will come to see this.''

American-Statesman, Austin, Texas.

 &HT;    The inspiration for `A Visit from St. Nicholas
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The poem that starts with that famous
first line `` 'Twas the night before Christmas'' was first
published 175 years ago, under no one's name.
</P>
<P>
   Clement Moore was a bit ashamed of it, actually. He was a writer
and a professor, with a doctorate from Columbia University. He put
together a dictionary of the Hebrew language.
</P>
<P>
   Take credit for lines such as ``His cheeks were like Roses, his
nose like a Cherry''? It wouldn't do.
</P>
<P>
   But ``A Visit from St. Nicholas,'' showed up in the Troy (N.Y.)
Sentinel on Dec. 23, 1823 and spread from newspaper to newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in 1844, Moore included it in a volume of his work.
</P>
<P>
   He had composed it for his six children for Christmas 1822. A
friend visiting the Moores in New York City heard him read the poem
_ or one of the children gave it to her _ and she went home to Troy
and gave it to the Sentinel editor.
</P>
<P>
   Moore apparently was inspired to write the poem on a trip to
upstate New York in 1822. He was visiting a cousin, Mary McVicker,
whose husband had died. McVicker and her four children lived in a
house called Constable Hall. Every room had a large chimney.
(``Down the chimney Saint Nicholas came with a bound.'') The
windows had shutters that opened to the inside. (``Tore open the
shutters and threw up the sash.'') There was porch, 125 feet long.
(`` `To the top of the porch! To the top of the wall!' '')
</P>
<P>
   And tending the garden was a Dutchman named Pieter. As the story
goes, he was rather plump. And downright jolly. Pieter was Moore's
inspiration for Santa Claus, says John Constable, 82, the last of
the family to live in Constable Hall. So the modern description of
Santa was born.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Constable, who now lives in Watertown, N.Y.,
never remembers the place having a problem with mice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I barely remember them talking about Clement Moore,''
Constable says. ``I was about 7 or 8 years old. I guess he was very
thoughtful, a family man.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore sent the family a hand-written copy of the poem, but
Constable doesn't know what happened to it. (The original sold at a
Christie's auction for $255,000.) But a chess set the writer sent
is still at the house.
</P>
<P>
   Every Christmas Eve, Constable says, the family would read
Moore's poem.
</P>
<P>
   But not anymore. Constable Hall _ now a museum on the state and
national historic registers _ is closed for the winter.

 &HT;    Coaching carousel spins on
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was 1989 when Steve Spurrier first realized that being a
lame-duck coach was for the birds.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before leading Duke into the All-America Bowl, Spurrier
told his players that he had accepted an offer to return to
Florida, his alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mistake,'' Spurrier said. ``A big mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   During the game, Spurrier caught one of the Blue Devils loafing
and gave the guy an earful.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just looked at me and smiled,'' Spurrier said. ``I could
see it in his eyes. `Hey, I don't have to listen to you. You're not
my coach anymore.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Spurrier gave Gators assistant coaches Bob Stoops and
Carl Franks his blessing earlier this month when they were hired as
head coaches at Oklahoma and Duke, respectively. They offered to
remain longer and contribute to Florida's preparation for the Jan.
2 Orange Bowl against Syracuse, but Spurrier said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told them that they needed to concentrate on their new
teams,'' he said. ``We have plenty of good coaches around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier's problem has become an all-too-familiar one in college
football this time of year. The bowl preparation time of December
is also the time of greatest movement of coaches from one job to
another. With less than a month before a bowl game, schools find
themselves without key assistants or, in some cases, no head coach.
It puts both the schools and the coaches in an uncomfortable
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches, at least most of them, want to do right by their old
employer, particularly if that school is playing in a big bowl
game. But the new employer usually is offering a significant salary
increase and wants the new coach on the road recruiting and
rebuilding the program.
</P>
<P>
   In this season's national championship game, No. 1 Tennessee
(12-0) plays No. 2 Florida State in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 4
without its offensive coordinator. David Cutcliffe resigned after
the SEC championship game on Dec. 5 to become the new coach at
Mississippi. Running backs coach Randy Sanders, 33, has received
the job on a permanent basis. Having to replace a coordinator on
the eve of one of the biggest games in school history should be a
stressful proposition, but coach Phillip Fulmer insists that it
will not be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy played quarterback at Tennessee and has been coaching
running backs and wide receivers ever since, so he knows our
system,'' Fulmer said. ``I may get a little more involved in
special situations now, but I have complete confidence in Randy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer was a little miffed that Ole Miss hired Cutcliffe on the
eve of the SEC championship game, but he understood that he would
not have his good friend for the Fiesta Bowl. It is the nature of
the profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that sooner or later David would become a head coach,
because he was ready,'' Fulmer said. ``We will miss him, but in
this case all we can do is wish him well.''
</P>
<P>
   Big Orange fans might not be so gracious should Tennessee be
unable to move the ball against Florida State, which wields the
nation's No. 1 defense. Tulane (11-0) will not be playing for a
championship when it takes on BYU in the Dec. 31 Liberty Bowl. But
the Green Wave will be going for its first undefeated season since
1931, which is a big deal for a school that has struggled as much
as Tulane. But Tulane will be without Tommy Bowden, who left to
become coach at Clemson. Assistant head coach Rich Rodriguez, the
offensive coordinator, was the choice of players and some boosters,
but athletics director Sandy Barbour picked Georgia assistant head
coach Chris Scelfo, a native of New Iberia, La.
</P>
<P>
   Since being tapped for the job on Dec. 7, Scelfo has been
scrambling to assemble a staff, get them out recruiting and prepare
the current team to play one of the biggest games in school
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been tough, because our kids have been through a lot in
just a few days,'' said Scelfo, whose brother, Frank, already was a
member of the Tulane staff. ``There's no question that this whole
thing is disruptive, and the ones who get hurt the most are the
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The recruiting calendar is one of the pressures causing coaches
to move in December. Coaches can begin direct contact with recruits
on Dec. 1, and the pressure is tremendous on new coaches to hit the
road recruiting for the new school immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Once a new coach is in place, it creates a domino effect
throughout the coaching profession as he tries to assemble a staff.
</P>
<P>
   Help may be on the way. Grant Teaff, the executive director of
the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA), says his group is
working on a plan that would keep coaches on campus more in
December, when their teams need them most. The AFCA hopes that the
result will be that schools won't feel pressured to hire a new
coach immediately. The goal is for schools to wait until after the
bowls before raiding the staffs of other schools. ``There's too
much pressure on the school and certainly too much pressure on the
coaches,'' Teaff said. ``It's not healthy for the profession. We
hope to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Teaff's group plans to submit its proposal to the NCAA early
next year. Given the current legislative structure of the NCAA, any
meaningful change is probably a year away.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the coaching merry-go-round continues. Each
opening filled creates an opening somewhere else, where another
group of players will be disappointed and maybe even disillusioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's part of the profession, but sometimes our players
get caught in the shuffle in this thing,'' Scelfo said. ``All of us
need to remember that.''

 &HT;    The world unfolds to a child reading a pop-up book
 &HT;    By Ricardo Gandara
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The world unfolds to a child reading a pop-up
book.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Circus'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $18.95), the greatest show on
Earth springs to life as Aunt Julie, who takes Buster and Emile to
the big top, mysteriously disappears. Later, they see her tumbling
from the high wire.
</P>
<P>
   In ``ABC Disney'' (Disney Press, $22.50), Dumbo almost flies off
the page, Hercules' biceps enlarge, Pinocchio's nose really grows
and Snow White raises the poisoned apple to her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The action is the result of 3-D paper sculpture that's crushed
on a page and unfolds or ``pops up'' when the page is opened.
Pop-up books _ generally aimed at children in elementary school _
bring a surprise on every page, sometimes with kids lifting a flap
or pulling a tab. It's a popular concept that engages children
because it's interactive.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Wheels on the Bus'' (Dutton Children's Books, $16.99),
the wipers on the bus go swish, swish, swish. In ``Snappy Little
Numbers'' (Millbrook Press, $12.95), the puppy's tongue dangles out
of his long snout. In ``Circus,'' Aunt Julie goes head first into
the cannon. In ``Guess How Much I Love You'' (Candlewick Press,
$17.99), Big Nutbrown Hare rocks Little Nutbrown Hare in his arms.
</P>
<P>
   Children's pop-up books are better than ever. Paper engineers,
the people behind the design, are wonderfully creative and skilled
at their craft. The big publishing houses are gobbling up the work
of people like Robert Sabuda, the celebrated paper engineer and
illustrator behind ``ABC Disney,'' ``Cookie Count,'' ``The 12 Days
of Christmas'' and ``The Christmas Alphabet.'' Sabuda, 33, doesn't
just make his characters pop, fly, wave and dance. For example, in
``ABC Disney,'' the genie in Aladdin uncoils from his lamp into a
cloud of smoke. In ``Cookie Count,'' a pinwheel twirls as the page
is opened.
</P>
<P>
   Movement happens because paper engineers work with the ``torque
and friction of the paper,'' says Sally Blakemore, the creative
director at Arroyo Projects in Santa Fe, N.M., the ``pop-up
packager'' for ``Circus.'' The packager is the company that does
everything but print and assemble the book. That is done in China,
Thailand and Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   The process of a pop-up book is complicated. ``Circus'' was
written by Meg Davenport and Lisa Werenko and illustrated by
Davenport. They took their story idea to Blakemore, who designed
the book. She worked with Andrew Baron on the paper engineering.The
book took three years to make, going through four stages of
approval before Simon &AMP; Schuster's Little Simon children's book
division published it this fall. Blakemore spent a month in China
overseeing the printing and assembling of the book.
</P>
<P>
   Pop-up books are an adventure to kids, says Sabuda, who is
working on a Mother Goose pop-up book for Simon &AMP; Schuster that
will be out next fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I hear more from children is that every page is a
physical surprise. Movement intrigues children. Movement adds to
the mystery of the book,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He's pleased that his work is interactive. ``It's nice to see a
child interact with a book in a non-electronic way. They learn and
have fun. Teachers have told me they use my books to teach
structures and how something collapses and stands,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Sabuda is self-taught. He had been writing and illustrating
children's books in 1993 when he decided to do a Christmas book.
Publishers told him he had to do something unique. Having enjoyed
pop-up books as a child, he bought several and tore them apart to
see how they worked. A year later, ``The Christmas Alphabet'' was
published. His books since then have won several awards.
</P>
<P>
   Blakemore says Sabuda is the most innovative paper engineer in
the industry. ``He certainly has an artistry with paper. We look at
his books to get ideas on how he's using the paper,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Sabuda says his work is fulfilling. ``It's selfish, too. I try
to come up with books that I would love as a kid,'' he says. ``A
lot of this is the child within me. I'm lucky it translates to a
larger audience.''

FINDING THE FREEBIES AT CHRISTMAS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The man burst into the store, one of those that smell of sugar
and spice and things so ambrosial that your eyes burn. He needed a
gift for his 80-year-old grandmother, he told the clerk who
suggested a number of things.
</P>
<P>
   Soap, candles, maybe a sachet, she said, explaining it's
something to put in your undies drawer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do grannies have an undies drawer?'' he inquired. She informed
him that all women have an undies drawer. He looked defeated, but
she pushed on and finally scored with a Victorian styled frame for
the great-grandkids' school photos and a lace doily to put the
frame on.
</P>
<P>
   Bravo, I told her, after he left.
</P>
<P>
   A few doors down at a book store, a flute quartet played
something that sounded like Bach. The musician in the middle wore a
Santa hat. A woman shopper had on brown felt reindeer antlers.
</P>
<P>
   Lovely odd things happen around Christmas. It is not just
Hallmark and Disney who know how to whip up the magic. Everyday
human beings are quite capable of creating warm fuzzies for
themselves and each other.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the Christmas setting is like being in a musical
comedy. People will suddenly burst into song walking down the
street, encouraged by some sidewalk violinist playing ``White
Christmas.'' People wear flamboyant costumes they would never
consider the rest of the year, appearing in red sweaters with giant
snowmen on their chests. They imagine there will be a party that
requires them to wear sequins. They sometimes are
uncharacteristically pleasant to each other.
</P>
<P>
   A San Francisco crowd poured out from a matinee performance of
``A Christmas Carol'' and were met by three men assembled in the
street and singing ``Ain't Gonna Study War No More.'' Some of the
people hurried off, but many lingered with big smiles on their
faces until the song was over and the men took their applause.
</P>
<P>
   It is not true that Christmas costs more than it gives back.
There are many holiday freebies. Most of the lights, music and the
smells are free. You just have to be out there and paying
attention.
</P>
<P>
   To get into an instantly festive mood, I recommend checking out
the elegant decorations in hotel lobbies. City hotels have giant
trees that are as tall as the chandeliers and old-fashioned
miniature villages and train sets. The trick is to walk in like you
belong, shrugging off your wool scarf as if it were made out of
animal pieces. You can sip one overpriced drink for a long time in
the lobby, look at the parade of cashmere coats and feel like you
are Myrna Loy waiting for William Powell.
</P>
<P>
   Go to a hotel where they serve a Christmas tea. Take your
daughters. Wear a hat. Eat tiny sandwiches. On the way out stop in
the glittery gift shop and buy one single ornament, a golden pear,
perhaps, which the store will wrap with the same artistry as if it
were a Faberge egg.
</P>
<P>
   I also like the daylong, non-shopping shopping trip. Go after
most of your required buying is completed. The idea is to be part
of the holiday horde but not hassled by it. A bunch of my friends
take the ferry to San Francisco. This way we don't have to worry
about parking. There's usually a free concert by carolers going
over and on the return, the city's skyline outlined in tiny white
lights. In between we eat, drink, eat again, make merry, look in
the windows, spray ourselves at perfume counters and browse without
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to be a kid again at Christmas has nothing to do with
age but letting yourself be dazzled over and again.
</P>
<P>
   A friend who used to be a school teacher said her favorite part
of Christmas was the last day of school before it let out for the
holidays. Everyone was nicer to each other, she said. Spirits were
genuinely up and it wasn't just because they were getting out of
school for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has their favorite things. I know a dedicated Grinch
who avoids most Christmas preliminaries but admits there's
something about Christmas morning that always sucks him in.
</P>
<P>
   For me it's Advent calendars, sugar cookies with sprinkles and
the snow scene in ``The Nutcracker.''
</P>
<P>
   A church choir in burgundy robes singing ``O Holy Night.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope in Rome on public television after midnight on
Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Getting out our own personal Christmas musical collection and
hearing Ray Charles sing ``Silent Night'' for the first time in a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Hot drinks with cinnamon sticks.
</P>
<P>
   Men in earmuffs carrying silver wrapped boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Pickup trucks with wreaths on front and construction sites with
Christmas trees on top.
</P>
<P>
   Going to a Sing-Along Messiah with the same friend each year and
hoping the people standing behind us know the alto part and sing
loud.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the tree at a place where they have an old potbelly
stove going and a sales person who can identify each tree by how
long its smell will last.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on neighbors for Christmas lights at night and fireplace
smells in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   A Christmas cactus blooming in December, the first time it's
been on schedule in five years.

IMPEACHMENT FRENZY STARTED WITH ATTACKS ON JUDGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the 
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.) 
(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   c. 1998 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   House
Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, began fomenting the current
impeachment madness two years ago. His earlier target was the
federal judiciary, later he elevated his sights _ to the
presidency. DeLay is acknowledged to be the force behind lining up
Republican votes to impeach President Clinton. He has cajoled,
threatened and pulled in favors in order to fuel a radical
revolution aimed at overturning democracy as we know it.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In mid-March of 1997, DeLay proclaimed, ``As part of our
conservative efforts against judicial activism, we are going after
judges.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay took his script from James Dobson of Focus on the Family,
Pat Buchanan, Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council, right-wing
activist David Barton, Pat Robertson and the Christian Coalition.
They all bemoaned what they called ``judicial tyranny'' and the
``imperial judiciary.''
</P>
<P>
   In May 1997, DeLay targeted three federal judges for impeachment
_ Harold Baer Jr. of the U.S. District Court of Manhattan, Fred
Biery of the U.S. District Court in San Antonio and Chief Judge
Thelton Henderson of the U.S. District Court in San Francisco _
because DeLay didn't like decisions they had handed down. He
claimed that ``articles of impeachment are being written right
now'' against Judge Biery.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative National Legal Foundation endorsed DeLay's call
for impeaching federal judges.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL even urged Congress to impeach the six U.S. Supreme
Court justices who had voted against Colorado's anti-gay amendment
in 1996, ruling it was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay promised more federal judges would be added to his hit
list. ``We have a whole big file cabinet full. We are receiving
nominations from all across the country of judges that could be
prime candidates for the first impeachment.'' DeLay made this
statement even before he had any evidence of impeachable crimes
against these judges. And then Clinton fell into his lap.
</P>
<P>
   It should be no surprise that Bob Barr, R-Ga., is the other
member of the U.S. House who caught the impeachment fever early.
He, too, has been a major voice behind the scenes orchestrating the
GOP impeachment of the president. Last year he was making speeches
in favor of impeaching judges, claiming that just the threat of
impeachment would keep the federal judiciary in line.
</P>
<P>
   We can expect these same voices to clamor for the heads of
judges as soon as the presidential impeachment has been played out.
</P>
<P>
   The ramifications of this impeachment madness are likely to be
profound. If Congress can impose its will upon the judiciary, the
system of checks and balances among the three branches of
government will crumble. An independent judiciary is the foundation
of our constitutional form of government. The judiciary has the
duty to guard the Constitution from legislative and executive
encroachment. It has the duty to protect the civil liberties of
every individual from the tyranny of the majority.
</P>
<P>
   The framers of the Constitution considered the independence of
the federal judges so important to our system of government that
judges hold office for life and their pay cannot be reduced as long
as they serve in ``good behavior.'' Judges cannot be removed for
rendering unpopular decisions. They cannot be legitimately removed
for political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The irony here is that one of the most conservative Chief
Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court, William Rehnquist, stands firm
against the right-wing radicals who would destroy the independence
of the judiciary and the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1991 law review article, ``The Impeachment Clause: A Wild
Card in the Constitution,'' Rehnquist wrote: ``If one were to
select the two major contributions to the art of government made by
the Founding Fathers in Philadelphia in 1778, I think one would
have to select: first, the separation of the executive from the
legislative power, and second, the creation of the independent
judiciary with the power of judicial review. Article II of the
Constitution establishes the President as the Chief Executive in
his own right, without any dependency on Congress such as that of a
Prime Minister in a parliamentary system. This article confers upon
the President powers which Congress cannot take away.''
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist ends the article stating: ``The principle of
separation of powers was not `home free' simply because it was
embodied in the Constitution, so long as the Impeachment Clauses
were also in that document. Battles were to be fought in the
succeeding two hundred years to preserve the principle of
separation of powers, and two of the most important of those
battles were waged outside the courts: the trial of ((U.S. Supreme
Court Justice)) Samuel Chase in the Senate in 1805, and the trial
of ((President)) Andrew Johnson in 1868.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither was convicted of any articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   We see a Congress deeply divided and troubled. There is a
partisan frenzy to impeach and impeach. Conservative GOP members of
Congress have watched their agenda blunted by the federal courts or
fragmented by the president. And now, in frustration, these
short-sighted elected officials are willing to destroy the
foundation of our system of government in order to get their way.
</P>
<P>
   Where are the statesmen who understand what is being done? The
nation needs them desperately.

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ LONDON - It was just past 11:30 p.m. and we
were returning to our hotel after enjoying a performance of Oscar
Wilde's ``An Ideal Husband.'' As we emerged from our tube station,
I spotted an ATM machine. I am drawn to ATM machines as a moth is
drawn to light. This time, however, something turned out the
lights. It is a bleak moment when you realize that you are
thousands of miles and five time zones away from home, your funds
nearly depleted and the card you have carried with you to get more
has been eaten by an alien ATM machine. (Kleinberg, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). MOVED MONDAY.

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ We didn't have support
groups when I was in school, which could explain why I'm ignorant
of the appeal of everybody getting in a heap and wailing. We did
have friends though and we'd complain until they were sick of
listening. Sometimes we told our parents what was on our minds, but
not often because our contrite confessions frequently had a way of
jumping and biting us. Maybe we didn't have any big problems back
then, although all of the elements were there. (Schuett, Cox News
Service) MOVED.

<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ Without question, Clinton has disgraced himself.
He put his presidency and his agenda at risk. He hurt his country
and the people he loves, and he undermined the causes that matter
to him and his supporters. Resignation would have been merciful. So
why haven't the majority of Americans been calling for it? (Young,
Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Make no mistake: this is a partisan coup in
constitutional form. We have entered dangerous political territory,
with potentially grave consequences for our republic. The
impeachment of a president, to be legitimate, must be the child of
necessity. The impeachment of President Bill Clinton is the bastard
of a counterfeit necessity, born of an excuse trying to pass as a
reason. (Teepen, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED MONDAY.

   SIBLEY-COLUMN _ She came to work in the yard and I waved her off
on some pruning she had in mind. I didn't want her to strip the old
log cabin of the bushes and trees that held it to the ground. ``I
love this old house,'' I remarked. ``You do!'' she yelped. ``I
thought you lived in it because you were ... well, trapped. After
she left, I brooded over that statement. (Sibley, Atlanta

<P>
   TWAS-THE-NIGHT _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The poem that starts
with that famous first line `` 'Twas the night before Christmas''
was first published 175 years ago, under no one's name. Clement
Moore was a bit ashamed of it, actually. He was a writer and a
professor, with a doctorate from Columbia University. He put
together a dictionary of the Hebrew language. Take credit for lines
such as ``His cheeks were like Roses, his nose like a Cherry''? It
wouldn't do. (Anna, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   BINGE-DRINKING _ AUSTIN, Texas _ A long time ago I gave up
drinking like this (I get drunk so differently now, so much more
slowly), and maybe you gave it up, too. It doesn't matter how long
it's been, when you walk in you feel it going on around you, you
smell it. Binge drinking smells like it always did. 60''. (Stuever,
Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TANGO _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It was my first tango lesson,
and I wasn't holding instructor Emily Jo Russo with the proper
arrogance of a flashing-eyed South American rake. She gently
disengaged and said: ``In tango, the man is dominant. He dictates
his partner's moves, and she must follow to please him.''
</P>
<P>
   Please me? I was already thrilled to think someone could tinge
my porridge-sodden, Scots-Irish soul with any amount of tango.
``Tango came out of the bordellos of South America,'' Russo
explained. Wow. So, if I understood, lonely, angry men went to the
bordellos for dance lessons? ``No, that's not it, entirely,'' she
said patiently. (Wiggins, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-ARTMUSEUM _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Casting across the Atlantic
for an architect to design its $40 million art museum, the
University of Texas has chosen the enterprising Swiss firm of
Herzog &AMP; de Meuronto plan its new Blanton Museum of Art. (Barnes,

   POP-UP-BOOKS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The world unfolds to a child
reading a pop-up book. In ``The Wheels on the Bus'' (Dutton
Children's Books, $16.99), the wipers on the bus go swish, swish,
swish. In ``Snappy Little Numbers'' (Millbrook Press, $12.95), the
puppy's tongue dangles out of his long snout. In ``Circus,'' Aunt
Julie goes head first into the cannon. In ``Guess How Much I Love
You'' (Candlewick Press, $17.99), Big Nutbrown Hare rocks Little
Nutbrown Hare in his arms. Children's pop-up books are better than

   FERTILITY-REACT _ ATLANTA _ Laura Guest, a 29-year-old metro
Atlanta woman had nothing but sympathy for a 27-year-old Houston
woman who recently gave birth to eight children after taking
fertility drugs. ``Heaven help her,'' said Guest, who gave birth to
twins after taking fertility drugs. ``Two wear me slap out.'' As
the Houston's mother's octuplets fight for their life, their
fragile condition hit uncomfortably close to home for many
Atlanta-area parents who have conceived through fertility drugs.
While most of the parents believe that couples should be allowed to
use fertility drugs, they believe the process should be regulated.
``Before you do it, you know it's a go-at-your-own risk process,''
said Carmen Jones, an Atlanta woman who gave birth to three
children through fertility drugs. (Blake, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). WITH PHOTO.

   GIFTS-PAWNSHOPS (San Francisco) _ Can't find something special
for Christmas for your dotty Aunt Dottie? How 'bout a Wedgewood
china urn? Or a $22,900 cane handle that just happens to be a
diamond-and-ruby Faberge egg? Or a 1994 Jaguar XJS convertible
that's got 24-karat gold plate trim down to its wire wheel spokes.
These and other treasures can be had at pawnshops, where a growing
number of holiday shoppers are finding all sorts of stuff. By
MARIANNE COSTANTINOU.
</P>
<P>
   BODY-GLITTER (San Francisco) _ There is nothing more festive
than the flash of diamonds _ or the seductive shimmer of a
high-lighted cheekbone or the lure of a shoulder swathed in moonlit
splendor. So, if it gleams, glitters, shines or sparkles, and it's
not diamonds, chances are it will show up on cheekbones, eyelids,
collarbones or deep in the decolletage via loose microscopic foil
paillettes, scintillating body gel or shimmer stick. By CYNTHIA
ROBINS.

   COWBOY-CUISINE (San Antonio) _ Fresh meat or sweets of any kind

pushing hard-headed cattle in a direction they didn't want to go.
Here are a few typical recipes used by cowboy cooks _ the lucky
ones, at least _ from Mexico to Montana. By RALPH WININGHAM.

   FBN-MARIUCCI (San Francisco) _ When Steve Mariucci took over as

too nice. But when his style of coaching helped the Niners win 11
straight games and home-field advantage through the playoffs, the
questions went away. Every now and then, though, it would be nice
to see a little swagger from Mariucci, a reminder that he's in
charge. By GWEN KNAPP.

<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Excuse me, but I have to get on
with America's business. That's what I keep hearing from everyone.
What is America's business? Entertainment, that's what. Lately
America has been entertaining only for fans of theater of the
absurd, as performed by the inmates of the asylum of Washington. By
ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ What times these are in the
richest and most powerful Judeo-Christian country in the world.
Hanukkah, Advent and bombs over Baghdad. Family values, moral
absolutism and a Capitol Hill coup d'etat led by adulterers against
an adulterer. Peace on Earth, good will to retail sales and
psychotic scarecrows on the city streets. Happy Birthday, Jesus. By
STEPHANIE SALTER.

<P>
   SAME-SEX-MARRIAGE (San Francisco) _ Here we go again _ just when
you think things are moving in a positive direction for the gay
community, along comes an issue religious conservatives hope will
divide Californians. Enough signatures were recently submitted to
qualify the `Defense of Marriage Act` for the March 2000 ballot.
The initiative would ban same-sex marriages in California. By

   Think back to your most enjoyable vacation in a foreign land.
Now consider what made the trip so special. Was it the exotic food?
The sightseeing? The accommodations? The shopping?
</P>
<P>
   Or was it the exciting new culture you experienced through
meeting and greeting the locals?
</P>
<P>
   If you responded affirmatively to the last question, then you've
been lucky enough to understand one of the most extraordinary
aspects of travel: the chance to learn about the lives and customs
of foreign people from the people themselves.
</P>
<P>
   One travel company that offers just that kind of opportunity is
Servas, a global organization with members in more than 130
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Servas is organized to promote world peace by connecting
travelers and foreign hosts to share their ideas, interests and
lives. It's for those who want to get beyond the Eiffel Tower and
the Louvre, and see a country through the eyes of its people,''
says Joyce Elson Moore, a mature traveler from Inverness, Fla., who
travels extensively through Servas' programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a 60-plus woman traveling alone on my first trip to Europe,
I landed in Paris and caught the TGV (france's high-speed train) to
Arras,'' Moore recalls. Moore was a bit overwhelmed, even though
she knew she would be meeting her first Servas host very shortly.
``I was armed with only a few French phrases and the determination
to see France.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stayed at a hotel my first two nights, then visited my first
Servas hosts who lived five minutes from the Arras train station.
They shared their home with me for two days, guiding me through the
bustling Saturday market in Arras, taking me to the poignant Vimy
Ridge and introducing me to coffee from a bowl, `the French way.'
We shared wine and meals, politics and problems. It was a notable
beginning for my two-week trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore wanted to share with readers of this column some anecdotes
from her most recent Servas adventure. She writes:
</P>
<P>
   ``Another Servas host allowed me to be a part of her busy family
life. Two dogs, a younger sister, a boyfriend and her mother made
up the family unit. Her younger sister asked me to come to her
English class at school, but unfortunately time would not permit
it. I walked to the train station with her mother and rode into
Paris. She spoke no English and I spoke very little French, but we
communicated like two old friends during the ride. Before she left
the train _ a few stops before me _ she kissed me in that endearing
French show of friendship: on both cheeks. Her daughter, my host,
wants to come to the United States, and I hope she does. She will
always be welcome at my home.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Moore's hosts was a lovely lady who, as a young Jewish
girl living in occupied France, had worn the obligatory yellow star
to elementary school. Moore was fascinated and saddened by the
woman's candid stories about living in France during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``She also asked me to see her perform in a Renaissance concert
in a nearby cathedral. Because she was part of the group, I was
invited into the choir room where later, to my surprise, the men
and women undressed down to their underwear to change from street
clothes into their Renaissance costumes. They were completely
unaware of my astonishment. After the concert, I was delighted to
be included in an midnight escapade with these 30 French singers to
a Chinese restaurant for a post-concert celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   Servas members can be travelers, hosts or both. A Servas member
can request host lists for up to five countries. These lists are
updated annually and include names and addresses, family status,
professions, interests and days of prior notice required.
</P>
<P>
   Although some hosts require no advance warning, it is helpful to
the host and traveler to write ahead if possible.
</P>
<P>
   You pay your own expenses through Servas. No money can exchange
hands between hosts and travelers for lodging or anything else.
There is only an exchange of ideas and mutual interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want an air-conditioned shuttle to your modern
Americanized hotel, and a porter to carry your bags, Servas may not
be for you,'' Moore warns. ``Servas travelers frequently have to
manage their own luggage and sleep in accommodations very different
than those to which they are accustomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you are interested in understanding communities on a
deeper level, meeting interesting people and learning about their
culture and traditions, join Servas.''

   Think back to your most enjoyable vacation in a foreign land.
Now consider what made the trip so special. Was it the exotic food?
The sightseeing? The accommodations? The shopping?
</P>
<P>
   Or was it the exciting new culture you experienced through
meeting and greeting the locals?
</P>
<P>

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The Big Apple can demolish a budget faster than the city can
level an old building in Times Square. With hotel occupancy running
more than 84 percent much of the year, New York City room rates now
average $200 a night. That's before paying restaurant prices that
can give plenty of indigestion, and buying $80 tickets to a
Broadway hit like ``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   One solution is to come in January. Sure, it can be cold. But
the Christmas hordes are gone, the city is catching its collective
breath and the cultural and entertainment life for which New York
is justly celebrated is in full swing.
</P>
<P>
   Museums are uncrowded, Broadway tickets are available and it's
possible to find a hotel room that won't break the bank.
</P>
<P>
   January also heralds Tax-Free Week, from Jan. 17 to 24, when
purchases of clothes, shoes and belts less than $500 are exempt
from New York City's brutal 8 1/4 percent sales tax. (That makes
January sales all the more tempting.)
</P>
<P>
   For hotels, start with hotel brokers like Quikbook (381 Park
Avenue South, New York, N.Y. 10016; 800-789-9887; www.quikbook.com)
and Express Reservations (3825 Iris Ave., Boulder, Colo. 80301;
800-356-1123; www.express-res.com). Both companies offer a select
range of popular hotels at discounts of 20 percent to 60 percent
off the published price.
</P>
<P>
   But it still pays to call hotels directly to compare prices. The
following rates are per night, based on double occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   Penny-pinchers should start by looking at the Malibu Hotel (2688
Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10025; 800-647-2227), at West 103rd St.
and Broadway on Manhattan's Upper West Side. It may not be the most
centrally located property in the city, but at $69 per night for a
double it's surely one of the best bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Mid-priced hotels, such as the Fitzpatrick Manhattan Hotel (687
Lexington Ave., New York, N.Y. 10022; 212-355-0100 or
800-367-7701), are offering an executive guest room for $189 per
night and a one-bedroom suite for $219 during January, which the
hotel claims is a savings of more than $100 a night.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Inter-Continental New York (111 East 48th St., New
York, N.Y. 10017; 800-327-0200) has a ``Half-Off New York''
package. Room rates begin at $189 per night or $289 for suites for
guests who book a weekend stay.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, every hotel purchase _ from food and beverage to
parking, phone calls and in-room movies _ are available at 50
percent off. The hotel is throwing in 500 frequent-flier miles per
stay with one of their partners.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who don't want to participate in the program, room
rates begin at $169 per night.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan East Suite Hotels (800-ME-SUITE), the city's largest
all-suite hotel group, has January rates that start at $184 for a
studio suite and $204 for a one-bedroom suite. Among the hotels
participating are the Shelburne Murray Hill (303 Lexington Ave.,
New York, N.Y. 10016; 212-689-5200).
</P>
<P>
   New York's newest boutique hotel, The Avalon (16 East 32 St.,
New York, N.Y. 10016; 888-HI-AVALON) opened in April in a former
office building after a $20 million renovation.
</P>
<P>
   The human-size body pillows that adorn each bed have become the
hotel's signature. In January, chef Larry Forgione, a founding
father of the new American cuisine, will open the Larry Forgione's
Coach House restaurant in the hotel. The hotel's ``Suite Winter''
special starts at $169 per night, including continental breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   January offers discounts even for those who can afford the best.
Take the Peninsula New York (700 Fifth Ave., New York, N.Y. 10019;
800-262-9467), which has just reopened after extensive remodeling.
The 23-story luxury hotel in Midtown has a ``Weekend No Frills''
rate of $370 per night. That's hardly a steal, but it's a far cry
from the normal rate of $535 per night for such luxury.
</P>
<P>
   Le Parker Meridiens (118 W. 57 St., New York, N.Y. 10019;
212-245-5000) ``Holiday Recovery Package'' offers the ultimate New
York indulgence, a guaranteed room with a panoramic view of Central
Park. It comes with breakfast at Norma's, the hotel's acclaimed new
restaurant that serves breakfast day and night, as well as a
massage for two. The price is $365 per room, per night. Extra
nights are $255 per room and include breakfast but not a massage.
</P>
<P>
   As for entertainment in January, jazz is synonymous with New
York and January marks ``Blue Note Takes N.Y.,'' a month-long
celebration of the 60th anniversary of the celebrated Blue Note
jazz label.
</P>
<P>
   Artists such as Max Roach, Lena Horne, Billy Higgins and Ron
Carter are scheduled to appear at such clubs as The Jazz Standard
(116 East 27th St., New York, N.Y. 10016; 212-576-2232), New York's
newest jazz haunt.
</P>
<P>
   Food is usually the least compelling reason to visit a jazz
club, but this club's restaurant, 27 Standard, has been singled out
by the city's food critics for it inventive cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   As for Broadway, Off-Broadway and Lincoln Center performances,
the TKTS (212-768-1818) booth in Times Square offers half-price
tickets to the same-day performances of many shows _ but accepts
cash only.
</P>
<P>
   Alternately, the Broadway Ticket Center, 212-302-4111, in the
new Times Square Visitors Center on Broadway at W. 47th Street
sells same-day and advance performance full-price tickets to
Broadway shows.
</P>
<P>

Bureau, 810 Seventh Ave., New York, N.Y. 10019; 212-484-1222.

   The Big Apple can demolish a budget faster than the city can
level an old building in Times Square. With hotel occupancy running
more than 84 percent much of the year, New York City room rates now
average $200 a night. That's before paying restaurant prices that
can give plenty of indigestion, and buying $80 tickets to a
Broadway hit like ``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   One solution is to come in January. Sure, it can be cold. But
the Christmas hordes are gone, the city is catching its collective
breath and the cultural and entertainment life for which New York
is justly celebrated is in full swing.
</P>
<P>
   Museums are uncrowded, Broadway tickets are available and it's
possible to find a hotel room that won't break the bank.
</P>
<P>
   January also heralds Tax-Free Week, from Jan. 17 to 24, when
purchases of clothes, shoes and belts less than $500 are exempt
from New York City's brutal 8 1/4 percent sales tax. (That makes
January sales all the more tempting.)
</P>
<P>
   For hotels, start with hotel brokers like Quikbook (381 Park
Avenue South, New York, N.Y. 10016; 800-789-9887; www.quikbook.com)
and Express Reservations (3825 Iris Ave., Boulder, Colo. 80301;
800-356-1123; www.express-res.com). Both companies offer a select
range of popular hotels at discounts of 20 percent to 60 percent
off the published price.
</P>
<P>
   But it still pays to call hotels directly to compare prices. The
following rates are per night, based on double occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   Penny-pinchers should start by looking at the Malibu Hotel (2688
Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10025; 800-647-2227), at West 103rd St.
and Broadway on Manhattan's Upper West Side. It may not be the most
centrally located property in the city, but at $69 per night for a
double it's surely one of the best bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Mid-priced hotels, such as the Fitzpatrick Manhattan Hotel (687
Lexington Ave., New York, N.Y. 10022; 212-355-0100 or
800-367-7701), are offering an executive guest room for $189 per
night and a one-bedroom suite for $219 during January, which the
hotel claims is a savings of more than $100 a night.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Inter-Continental New York (111 East 48th St., New
York, N.Y. 10017; 800-327-0200) has a ``Half-Off New York''
package. Room rates begin at $189 per night or $289 for suites for
guests who book a weekend stay.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, every hotel purchase _ from food and beverage to
parking, phone calls and in-room movies _ are available at 50
percent off. The hotel is throwing in 500 frequent-flier miles per
stay with one of their partners.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who don't want to participate in the program, room
rates begin at $169 per night.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan East Suite Hotels (800-ME-SUITE), the city's largest
all-suite hotel group, has January rates that start at $184 for a
studio suite and $204 for a one-bedroom suite. Among the hotels
participating are the Shelburne Murray Hill (303 Lexington Ave.,
New York, N.Y. 10016; 212-689-5200).
</P>
<P>
   New York's newest boutique hotel, The Avalon (16 East 32 St.,
New York, N.Y. 10016; 888-HI-AVALON) opened in April in a former
office building after a $20 million renovation.
</P>
<P>
   The human-size body pillows that adorn each bed have become the
hotel's signature. In January, chef Larry Forgione, a founding
father of the new American cuisine, will open the Larry Forgione's
Coach House restaurant in the hotel. The hotel's ``Suite Winter''
special starts at $169 per night, including continental breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   January offers discounts even for those who can afford the best.
Take the Peninsula New York (700 Fifth Ave., New York, N.Y. 10019;
800-262-9467), which has just reopened after extensive remodeling.
The 23-story luxury hotel in Midtown has a ``Weekend No Frills''
rate of $370 per night. That's hardly a steal, but it's a far cry
from the normal rate of $535 per night for such luxury.
</P>
<P>
   Le Parker Meridiens (118 W. 57 St., New York, N.Y. 10019;
212-245-5000) ``Holiday Recovery Package'' offers the ultimate New
York indulgence, a guaranteed room with a panoramic view of Central
Park. It comes with breakfast at Norma's, the hotel's acclaimed new
restaurant that serves breakfast day and night, as well as a
massage for two. The price is $365 per room, per night. Extra
nights are $255 per room and include breakfast but not a massage.
</P>
<P>
   As for entertainment in January, jazz is synonymous with New
York and January marks ``Blue Note Takes N.Y.,'' a month-long
celebration of the 60th anniversary of the celebrated Blue Note
jazz label.
</P>
<P>
   Artists such as Max Roach, Lena Horne, Billy Higgins and Ron
Carter are scheduled to appear at such clubs as The Jazz Standard
(116 East 27th St., New York, N.Y. 10016; 212-576-2232), New York's
newest jazz haunt.
</P>
<P>
   Food is usually the least compelling reason to visit a jazz
club, but this club's restaurant, 27 Standard, has been singled out
by the city's food critics for it inventive cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   As for Broadway, Off-Broadway and Lincoln Center performances,
the TKTS (212-768-1818) booth in Times Square offers half-price
tickets to the same-day performances of many shows _ but accepts
cash only.
</P>
<P>
   Alternately, the Broadway Ticket Center, 212-302-4111, in the
new Times Square Visitors Center on Broadway at W. 47th Street
sells same-day and advance performance full-price tickets to
Broadway shows.
</P>
<P>

Bureau, 810 Seventh Ave., New York, N.Y. 10019; 212-484-1222.

UN LEADER SEEKS NEW WAY TO MONITOR IRAQI WEAPONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary General Kofi Annan has formed a
high-level task force to consider supplanting the UN weapons
inspection unit in Iraq with a less aggressive arms control entity,
well-placed UN sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi task force, made up of Annan's chief advisers and UN
disarmament expert Jayantha Dhanapala, is studying a proposal to
shift the task of eliminating Iraq's chemical and biological
weapons to the Hague-based Organization for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons, which does not have the political baggage of the
UN Special Commission, or UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative is designed to mend the rifts in the sharply
divided Security Council in the wake of the US bombing campaign.
But it also signals the UN chief's deepening hostility toward
Richard Butler, the chairman of UNSCOM charged with ridding Iraq of
its long-range missiles and its chemical and biological weapons.
Butler has alienated many council members with his combative style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is not helpful that the council is divided,'' Annan
said Monday. ``I would hope that in the weeks ahead we will find a
way of bringing everyone together to that we can carry on the
essential work of the council.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would shift many of UNSCOM's responsibility for
eliminating Iraq's most lethal weapons to other groups. The
International Atomic Energy Agency, which enjoys a cordial working
relationship with Baghdad, would continue to monitor Iraq's nuclear
program. A third ad hoc inspection team would have to be created to
monitor Iraq's long-range missile program.
</P>
<P>
   ``These would continue to be intrusive inspections,'' said a
source familiar with the plan. But the new inspectors would not be
perceived as agents for the ``Anglo-Saxon intelligence club.
Therefore, politically it may be possible for this idea to fly.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior UN official cautioned that the proposal was only one
among at least half a dozen ideas being hashed out by Annan's
advisers. The source said that Annan has not endorsed any one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Several governments say `` `We need a new structure, we need a
new inspection mechanism,' '' said Annan, adding that he was
engaged in a series of high-level discussions with world leaders.
``I don't know what that means. ... But it will emerge after the
discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration said it is too early to consider
UNSCOM's replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's premature to speculate about that,'' said White House
national security spokesman David Leavy. ``We've said that what we
want is for UNSCOM to be able to go back in there, and if it's
effective that would be preferable.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan's political advisers say the UN chief is under pressure to
help formulate a post-bombing Iraq policy and to try to break the
impasse in the 15-nation Security Council, which created UNSCOM in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, China and France, eager to see Butler resign, would also
like to see a less confrontational weapons-monitoring regime return
to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain, while publicly committed to
Butler, have made it clear that they will no longer fight for his
survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see UNSCOM back,'' Britain deputy foreign minister
Derek Fatchett said. ``It would not be productive at this stage for
other countries to start trying to select the next head of UNSCOM.
We still have faith in Butler and we don't see that as a key agenda
item.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, France floated its own proposal to establish a less
intrusive version of the UN Special Commission, free of the
controversial surprise inspections that have offended the Iraqi
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The French proposal, considered a non-starter by American and
British diplomats, also calls for an end to economic sanctions. In
its place, the French envision a system of tight financial controls
designed to thwart the import or export of weapons-related
material.
</P>
<P>
   In its first meeting on Iraq since the American bombing campaign
ended, the Security Council failed to begin even preliminary
discussions on its long-term relationship with Iraq. Instead, the
Council simply released a bland statement pledging its intention to
``pursue this question actively.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz, meanwhile, said Monday
that Baghdad would never let UNSCOM back into the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment America and Britain launched missiles against Iraq
they killed UNSCOM,'' Aziz said. ``I cannot give them another
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler's relationship with the council and the UN chief has
eroded drastically over the current crisis with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and China -- angered by Butler's role in providing a
pretext for US bombing -- charged the Australian diplomat with
producing a distorted account of Iraq's efforts to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   While Butler defended his report as ``fair'' and ``objective,''
he has expressed concern that the missile attack on Baghdad may
ultimately cost him his job. Still, he has refused demands for his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Annan -- the man who appointed Butler to his job but does not
have the authority to fire him -- will not be sad to see him go,
according to UN sources.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Butler's future, Annan Monday responded: ``I think
that is a question I would prefer not to answer today.''

   It is proverbial that old men plant trees as an act of faith,
precisely because they know they won't themselves live to sit under
their shade. In this spirit, we believe the time has come to put
aside political differences and plant seeds of justice and
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   There is precedent for this, for during our presidencies each of
us made difficult and controversial decisions in efforts to heal
national divisions _ the pardoning of President Richard Nixon and
the granting of amnesty for those who had avoided the Vietnam
draft.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of President Clinton's impeachment by the House of
Representatives, America once again suffers from a grievous and
deepening wound. Our people are angrily divided. Our political
institutions are called into question. Public confidence erodes
under waves of personal smearmongering.
</P>
<P>
   Against such a backdrop of inflamed emotions, we are convinced
that the public good requires a prompt and fair resolution of the
impeachment issue. While our acts of pardon or clemency are not
directly analogous to the decision pending before the Senate, how
that body resolves the issue can have similar benefits of healing
and finality.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Senate procedures, through their flexibility and
freedom, provide the means to end this national ordeal in ways that
can uphold the rule of law without permanently damaging the
presidency. Before the senators make history, we hope they will
first turn to history for help in devising what would be, in
effect, a unique punishment for a unique set of offenses.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred and thirty years have passed since the last
impeachment of an American president. At the time of President
Andrew Johnson's 1868 trial, as now, Senate Standing Rules and the
Rules of Impeachment permitted almost all motions and matters of
evidence to be determined by a majority vote.
</P>
<P>
   (By way of example, early in the proceedings, Chief Justice
Salmon Chase, who presided over Johnson's Senate trial, put to a
vote the question of whether to delay the trial for 40 days as
requested by Johnson's lawyers. Members responded by granting only
10 days.)
</P>
<P>
   Most recent impeachment cases involving judges have been
resolved expeditiously by having a trusted bipartisan committee
hear the evidence, either in public or private sessions, before
making a recommendation to the full body for its consideration. How
might all this bear on the current situation? In addition to
immediate dismissal of the charges against Clinton, there are four
alternatives for the Senate to weigh: a trial followed by
acquittal; a trial followed by conviction and removal from office;
a trial followed by censure; or censure without a trial.
</P>
<P>
   As intended by the founders, a two-thirds majority presents a
formidable obstacle for the advocates of conviction and removal.
Moreover, the sharp divisions rending the House, though sincerely
held and based on principle, do not bode well for a quick or clear
decision on either acquittal or removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   However one now supposes a trial may end, it seems inevitable
that by rehashing the lurid evidence of Clinton's misconduct, we
will only exacerbate the jagged divisions that are tearing at our
national fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow we must reach a conclusion that most Americans can
embrace and that posterity will approve. Make no mistake, the
judgment of history does matter. It matters profoundly. And
impeachment by the full House has already brought profound disgrace
to Clinton. Whatever happens in the near future will do little to
affect history's judgment of him.
</P>
<P>
   But he is not alone in standing before the bar of judgment. Our
political system too is on trial. Can we find within ourselves the
will, the vision, the generosity and, yes, the courage to resolve
the present crisis in a way that makes Americans proud of their
leaders, their institutions and themselves?
</P>
<P>
   It is with this in mind that we personally favor a bipartisan
resolution of censure by the Senate. Under such a plan, Clinton
would have to accept rebuke while acknowledging his wrongdoing and
the very real harm he has caused.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional resolution should contain language stipulating
that the president's acceptance of these findings _ including a
public acknowledgment that he did not tell the truth under oath _
cannot be used in any future criminal trial to which he may be
subject. It may even be possible for the special prosecutor
publicly to forgo the option of bringing such charges against the
president when Clinton leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Some may object that a censure can be repealed by a future
Congress, and is thus rendered meaningless. They underestimate the
power of the modern news media to foster indelible images in the
public memory. In any event, no one can undo Clinton's impeachment
by the full House.
</P>
<P>
   It is the genius of our Constitution that its authors provided
us a governing charter whose legal mechanisms permit the nation to
heal itself, so long as the end result is both justice and grace.
Clearly, the American people expect and desire an outcome that is
firm, fair and untainted by partisan advantage. That is the
challenge before us. How we meet that challenge will go a long way
toward healing our divided nation.

   WASHINGTON _ In a controversial and partisan vote, the
Republican-majority House of Representatives has voted to impeach
Santa Claus, aka ``Kris Kringle,'' aka ``St. Nick,'' aka ``Jolly
Old Nick.''
</P>
<P>
   The grounds? Perjury, obstruction of justice, eavesdropping,
mail fraud, operating an illegal monopoly ... and other ``high
crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   It marks the first time in modern history that a fabled holiday
character has been impeached. (Of course, The Grinch Who
 &UR; allegedly &LR;  Stole Christmas would have faced an impeachment hearing
and almost-certain conviction in 1957 had he not experienced a
change of heart and returned an estimated $1.2 million in gifts and
personal possessions to the constituents of Whoville.)
</P>
<P>
   Claus has perennially achieved astronomical approval ratings
with the public, but he has also been the subject of rumors and
innuendo about the way he conducts his seasonal gift-giving
business _ including almost-yearly allegations that his North Pole
headquarters are ``gingerbread sweatshops,'' as one workers' rights
group once put it.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years there also have been pointed questions and
numerous inquiries into the near-total monopoly on business enjoyed
by Claus.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy makes Bill Gates look like a social worker,'' said
Rep. Henry Hyde (R.-Ill.), who led the charge to impeach Claus.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sees you when you're sleeping, he knows when you're
awake!'' cried Rep. Dan Burton (R.-Ind.), who called for the
ambassador to the North Pole to immediately return to the United
States as a safety measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like people seeing me when I'm sleeping, and I sure as
heck don't want 'em to know when I'm awake!'' Burton said. ``Big
Brother is alive and well, apparently.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a day marked by stunning developments, prompting the
cable networks CNN, MSNBC and Fox News to cancel regularly
scheduled programming in favor of nonstop coverage. (The original
Big Three networks provided frequent updates, while Fox TV carried
on with its planned lineup, including a two-hour special, ``When
Animals Attack Criminals Who Are Caught on Tape in the Act of
Stealing From Strippers' Dressing Rooms.'')
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders filled the air with passionate rhetoric. In a
press conference after the vote was held, Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott (R.-Miss.), who is pushing for a Jan. 6 trial date,
thundered: `WHAT did Claus know and WHEN did he know it!!!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a lawyer, but I have questions about this whole
chimney thing,'' said Rep. Mary Bono (R.-Calif.), who tried
unsuccessfully to get colleagues to join her in a rendition of
``Let it Snow'' before the articles of impeachment were voted upon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I don't even have a chimney and I always find gifts
under the tree!'' Bono added. ``What's THAT about?''
</P>
<P>
   Equally stunning was the surprise resignation of Claus' head
elf, Jimmy ``The Fixer'' Spritely, who announced he would be
leaving his post in the wake of an Internet report alleging
numerous extra-elfin affairs over the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot in good conscience ask for Mr. Claus to resign if I
do not lead by example,'' said Spritely. ``As much as it pains me
and my family to admit this, I did indeed stray from the path of
fidelity years ago, indulging in youthful indiscretions with, oh,
about 11 or 12 elfin interns.__ OW!!''
</P>
<P>
   (Spritely's ``Ow!'' remark was apparently in reaction to the
kick in the shins he received from his wife, Lonnie, who was
standing next to him during his announcement.)
</P>
<P>
   The Spritely story was published in the on-line version of
Barely Legal magazine and was then picked up by The Washington
Post. A spokesman for the newspaper said the fact that Barely Legal
had already gone with the story compelled it to do follow-up
reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was already out there for the whole world to see,'' The
Post's spokesman said. ``What are we supposed to do, ignore it?''
</P>
<P>
   Barely Legal's on-line site has a daily readership of
approximately 143, according to a Barely Legal spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   As for Mr. Claus, he issued a defiant statement vowing never to
resign and to continue his job: the business of ``manufacturing
toys for good girls and boys the world over.'' While Congress
debated his fate, Claus and Mrs. Claus followed a business-as-usual
routine. This included ``making a list and checking it twice,''
according to a North Pole spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   When Claus appeared briefly in public to feed his reindeer, he
ignored the shouted questions of reporters _ although some
observers claimed he bellowed a hearty ``Ho ho ho!'' in the
direction of Sam Donaldson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was an editorial comment,'' said the North Pole
spokesman, who refused to elaborate.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It is time to register outraged and principled opposition to the
impeachment charade now going on in Washington.
 &HT;    We know that the huge majority opposes President Clinton's
impeachment. Too often, the press has attributed this irrefutable
fact, which is shown clearly in the public-opinion polls, to some
notion of economic comfort, as if Clinton were being supported only
out of the selfishness created by a good economy.
 &HT;    In fact, those who support Clinton the MOST are those who
benefit from our economy the LEAST.
 &HT;    Opposition to impeachment exists because people around the
country are smart enough to know that ``Impeach Clinton'' and even
``Impeach Hillary'' bumper stickers have been sported and sold ever
since the Clintons entered the White House, by many of the same
right-wing groups who now stand for his impeachment.
 &HT;    People are smart enough to figure out that the Congress members
voting for impeachment have a suspiciously high correlation to
those owned by such obsessed minority lobbies as the tobacco
industry, the National Rifle Association and anti-abortion
organizations _ all sworn enemies of Clinton and his majoritarian
policies.
 &HT;    Do I agree with all of Clinton's policies? Of course not. I'll
never forgive him for signing the welfare bill. I'm proud of the
National Organization for Women and other women's groups who staged
a hunger strike outside the White House in the vain hope of
dissuading him.
 &HT;    But I also know that he has stood for equal economic and human
rights far more than the so-called Republican opponents _ and I
know what interests that angers.
 &HT;    I also know that even if President Reagan or President Bush had
been guilty of the same sexual misjudgment _ and then tried to
conceal it _ I wouldn't have supported their impeachment either.
Indeed, when the right-wing congressman Bob Bauman (of Maryland)
was accused of a sexual episode with a young man, the only question
I and other feminists asked was: Was this welcome sex or not?
Because if it was welcome, then it wasn't sexual harassment. And it
wasn't our business.
 &HT;    My fear is that the right wing is distorting and defeating
sexual-harassment law in much the same way that they have tried to
distort and defeat affirmative-action law.
 &HT;    Remember, these are the same folks who opposed sexual-harassment
law in the first place. Phyllis Schlafly testified in Congress
against it and insisted that if women just dressed and behaved like
ladies, they wouldn't have this problem.
 &HT;    But now, the right wing is trying to use its version of the law
to peacefully assassinate a president. In the process, they have
convinced more than 60 percent of Americans that sexual-harassment
law has gone too far; that it forbids all sex in the workplace, all
sex between unequals, even all sex outside of marriage _ none of
which it does or should do.
 &HT;    In fact, sexual-harassment law has nothing to do with welcome
sex. The use of the word ``welcome'' is an innovation of this law.
``Consent'' can be coerced. ``Welcomeness'' cannot. It's the
religious right wing that is the Ayatollah here, not the creators
and supporters of sexual-harassment law.
 &HT;    Bill Clinton should not have had to testify about Monica
Lewinsky at all. The enjoyment of mutually welcome sex does not
constitute a ``pattern and practice'' of unwelcome sex. Unequal
status may be an index of suspicion, but it is not dispositive, as
lawyers say. We who support sexual-harassment law are not the sex
police. Any idea that this law allows such policing will only
defeat a good and much-needed statute.
 &HT;    We should also call for an end to the humiliation of Monica
Lewinsky. This young woman broke no law, yet found herself
surrounded by FBI agents and denied access to her own lawyer. She
has been forced to reveal the most intimate details of her private
life _ under threat of her own imprisonment, and even the
imprisonment of her mother.
 &HT;    We owe it to her and ourselves to protest against the jokes,
humiliation and ridicule she has suffered. She has the right to
privacy, sexual expression and legal protection _ and if she does
not, neither do we.
 &HT;    We should also admit that we may be projecting our own
experience. For example, I have two women friends who were sexually
abused by their fathers. They have a hard time believing that
Monica could have been there voluntarily. I know another woman who
was done in by a faithless husband. Clinton's example hits a
bruise, and she reacts with pain and anger. I've been lucky enough
to have neither experience, and so can believe that Monica was
there voluntarily.
 &HT;    I don't even believe that power is the ultimate aphrodisiac.
When I was Monica's age, Eisenhower was president. I wouldn't have
gone to bed with Eisenhower, would you? I rest my case.
 &HT;    It's clear that many men and some women in the media hate
Clinton for reasons of the culture wars, even though they agree
with him on issues more than I do. It drives them crazy that
Clinton has won the most powerful position in the world without the
proper ``masculine'' behavior.
 &HT;    For example, his origins were lower-class (the same guys seem to
feel differently about the philandering of President Kennedy or
President Bush); he loved and remained close to his mother; he
married a wife who was at least his equal; he refused to go to war;
and he actually listens.
 &HT;    In other words, Clinton refused to play the usual male game _
and won anyway.
 &HT;    But none of these personal reasons can justify impeachment.
Clinton's behavior _ self-defeating and reckless as it was _ does
not constitute ``treason or other high crimes and misdemeanors.''
 &HT;    The only thing that might be gained here is an understanding
that the religious right wing has won a disproportionate control of
Congress because so few Americans vote. If we get mad enough to
stop being the democracy with the lowest voter turnout in the
world, even this painful charade may have been worth it.

with him on issues more than I do. It drives them crazy that
Clinton has won the most powerful position in the world without the
proper ``masculine'' behavior.
 &HT;    For example, his origins were lower-class (the same guys seem to
feel differently about the philandering of President Kennedy or
President Bush); he loved and remained close to his mother; he
married a wife who was at least his equal; he refused to go to war;
and he actually listens.
 &HT;    In other words, Clinton refused to play the usual male game _
and won anyway.
 &HT;    But none of these personal reasons can justify impeachment.
Clinton's behavior _ self-defeating and reckless as it was _ does
not constitute ``treason or other high crimes and misdemeanors.''
 &HT;    The only thing that might be gained here is an understanding
that the religious right wing has won a disproportionate control of
Congress because so few Americans vote. If we get mad enough to
stop being the democracy with the lowest voter turnout in the
world, even this painful charade may have been worth it.

MAKING A FEAST FIT FOR A COWBOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RALPH WININGHAM  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Nobody argued over a turkey leg or the last piece
of pie at a Christmas meal when cowboys of old were eating trail
dust and pushing hard-headed cattle in a direction they didn't want
to go.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh meat or sweets of any kind were a rare luxury for most
range riders.
</P>
<P>
   If they were lucky, their holiday meal would be SOB (yes, that's
what it stands for) stew with a dessert of vinegar cobbler.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it wasn't much, but it was better than their standard
fare, beans, bacon, bread (normally biscuits) and coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas, birthdays and any holiday were just another work day
for men living in saddle with a horse and a rifle as their only
companions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every cowboy was a cook. They had to be to survive,'' said
Tommy Worrell, a former movie and television actor and current
chuckwagon cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them were better than others. The good ones got to
cook on the trail drives or at the ranch house. Woe be to anyone
who got on the bad side of the cook. He was a very important person
and could make it tough on anyone who crossed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Culinary delights were few and far between for lean, hard men
riding the range in lean, hard times, Worrell added, explaining
that he has done extensive research on the Old West, particularly
on food.
</P>
<P>
   ``During wet weather, they couldn't eat anything because the
cook couldn't build a fire,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Worrell, who operates the Diamond W Longhorn Ranch, Chuckwagon
Supper and Cowboy Show near San Antonio, said unlike scenes from
many western movies, cowboys seldom ate any meat other than salt
pork or bacon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they happened upon some turkey eggs, or a peach tree, or
shot a buffalo, they would take advantage of it. The cattle were
owned by the rancher, and they could only use the crippled ones or
those that died.
</P>
<P>
   Coffee was absolutely necessary because it provided the required
daily intake of liquid.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the water from streams and rivers didn't taste very
good, so they made coffee,'' Worrell explained.
</P>
<P>
   He said most people are surprised to learn about the cowboy's
Spartan fare when he does demonstrations and shows, like the San
Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo in February where he will set up as
many as five chuckwagons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cowboys just worked hard and slept very little. The only thing
they might be able to count on was that a good cook would keep
biscuits and coffee around all the time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Ball, a 79-year-old veteran cook, hunting guide and
part-time historian, said cowboys were hungry all the time ``so
they would eat about anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Potatoes and onions were totally foreign to them and sugar was
about as precious as gunpowder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vaqueros in South Texas and Mexico ate about the same as
other cowboys, except they would make pan de campo or tortillas if
they had the ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Occasionally, they would pass by some place where they could
get dried fruit or canned goods. That was made into a special meal
no matter when it was,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Worrell and Ball said few, if any, spices were available to
turn any cowboy meal into something other than belly filler.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why the trail bosses liked to get Mexican or black
cooks, because they might use different things to spice up a
meal,'' Worrell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read about one trail drive that had a gourmet European cook
who wanted to see the Old West. He brought a box of European stuff
with him, like canned salmon and wine, so he could really make good
meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``For cowboys who were used to just salt and pepper, that was
really a special time,'' Worrell said.
</P>
<P>
   The following are a few typical recipes used by cowboy cooks
from Mexico to Montana.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   SOB STEW
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds lean beef
</P>
<P>
   1/2 calf heart, cleaned

<P>
   1 1/2 pounds calf liver
</P>
<P>
   1 set sweetbreads
</P>
<P>
   1 set brains
</P>
<P>
   1 set marrow gut
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana hot sauce (Tabasco)
</P>
<P>
   Cut up beef, liver and heart into 1-inch cubes. Slice marrow gut
into small rings. Place in a Dutch oven, cover meat with water and
simmer two or three hours. Add salt, pepper and hot sauce to taste.
Cut sweetbreads and brains into small pieces, add to stew. Simmer
another hour, never boiling.

</P>
<P>
   Mix sugar and flour dry, then add other ingredients. Put
everything into a baking dish and dot with butter. Cover with pie
crust and bake at 375 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes. NOTE: Tastes
just like lemon pie, honest.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   PAN DE RANCHE (CAMPO)
</P>
<P>
   5 pounds flour
</P>
<P>
   1 pound shortening
</P>
<P>
   3 tbsp baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1 can evaporated milk
</P>
<P>
   2 cans water
</P>
<P>
   Mix flour, shortening and baking powder together. Set aside. Mix
evaporated milk and water together and slowly add the liquid to the
flour mixture until the dough can be rolled and shaped into round
loaves about one-fourth-inch thick and slightly smaller than the
bottom of a Dutch oven. Grease the bottom and sides of the oven,
and drop in one of the loaves. Cover and place twice as many coals
on the lid of the oven as you have underneath it. Lift the lid and
turn the bread after 15 minutes, allowing it to brown on both
sides. Repeat with other loaves. Recipe makes about 12 loaves that
can be saved and reheated for future use.

<P>
   1 package, dried shrimp
</P>
<P>
   Fill the Dutch oven with water and using the tender, young
leaves of the cactus, which have been chopped into small pieces,
boil the nopalitos for about 15 minutes. Discard the water and
rinse out the oven. Grease the bottom of the oven and add all the
ingredients. Fry the mixture for about 10 minutes, stirring
constantly. Nopalitos can be eaten like this, or the mixture may be
scrambled with eggs.

until gravy thickens, stirring constantly. Sprinkle meat pieces
with paprika and serve with gravy on the side.

   DRY APPLE PIE
</P>
<P>
   Filling: 1 quart sliced, dried apples
</P>
<P>
   1 quart water
</P>
<P>
   1/2 lemon, juiced
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 tbsp cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   1 tbsp butter
</P>
<P>
   Crust:
</P>
<P>
   2-1/4 cups sifted flour
</P>
<P>
   3/4 tsp salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup lard
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup cold water
</P>
<P>
   Mix apple slices and water in a Dutch oven, simmer about 30
minutes until slices are tender but not mushy. Add lemon juice.
Blend 2 tablespoons of sugar with cornstarch, then add to apples
with remaining sugar. Continue to heat and stir about three
minutes. Remove from heat, stir in butter and set aside to cool. To
prepare crust, place flour and salt in a large mixing bowl, cut in
lard until mixture is crumbly (like dry oatmeal). Add water, about
a tablespoon at a time, tossing with a folk, until mixture just
holds together. Divide pastry in half. Roll one half on a lightly
floured board into a circle about 12 inches in diameter. Lay a
rolling pin across center of the circle, gently fold in half over
the rolling pin and ease pastry into a 9-inch pan. Press pastry
lightly over bottom and up sides of the pan, and then spoon in the
cooled filling. Repeat rolling out of the other half of the dough,
place on top of the pan, pinch together the top and bottom into a
high fluted edge. Make several cuts in the top of the crust to
allow steam to escape and bake at 350 degrees for about 45 or 50
minutes until crust is golden brown. Allow to cool for a few
minutes before cutting. NOTE: This dessert would have been the
highlight dish of any three-month cattle drive.

THE CHRISTMAS OF MISSILES AND MAYHEM 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ She was standing about halfway between the
demonstrations: the impeach/don't-impeach Clinton rallies at the
edge of the San Francisco Bay, and the rally against bombing Iraq
near the San Francisco Centre shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   Although her gaunt face was ravaged, I'd guess she was just 30.
She wore a cotton blouse that had shrunk (or never been her size),
baggy teal-colored pants, no socks and flimsy black shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The woman was psychotic. Staring into the ether, she chewed her
lower lip as if it were beef jerky and mumbled in a low monotone.
Her entire face fairly roiled with spasmodic ticks. Her skinny
frame seemed to sway with each person who walked hurriedly by her.
</P>
<P>
   Not 10 minutes before, I had clasped hands with two strangers in
a sea of strangers, and we had all swayed and sung, ``We Shall
Overcome.'' Whatever self-consciousness I felt at resurrecting a
'60s civil rights anthem in the name of a flawed but unfairly
besieged president was outweighed by the need to release a river of
thought and emotion from inside.
</P>
<P>
   I had gone to the pro-Clinton rally, as a citizen, sick of the
garbage pile-up of impeachment opinion (pro and con) that threatens
to smother us all. While it was comforting to chant, cheer and clap
along, it was chilling to have the anti-Clinton protesters at my
back, screaming during a prayer, blowing plastic stadium horns
during the choir's songs and trying to obliterate with mass
choruses of boos the impassioned words of speakers like writer
Richard Rapaport.
</P>
<P>
   So much hate in the cool night air. So much dehumanization. A
nation divided. Into many opposing camps.
</P>
<P>
   I was divided. Instead of ``We Want Bill!'' I'd rather have
shouted: ``Stop the partisan, unconstitutional impeachment of the
president so that I can protest his sanctions and murderous war on
Iraq!''
</P>
<P>
   Some chant.
</P>
<P>
   What times these are in the richest and most powerful
Judeo-Christian country in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Hanukkah, Advent and bombs over Baghdad. Family values, moral
absolutism and a Capitol Hill coup d'etat led by adulterers against
an adulterer. Peace on Earth, good will to retail sales and
psychotic scarecrows on the city streets.
</P>
<P>
   Forcing myself to watch her, I came to see that heart-breaking,
insane woman was the most potent protest demonstration of the
night. She was a demonstration against the hypocrisy of our
Judeo-Christian family values. Against the unavoidable tyranny of a
free-market economy. Against our cruelly imbalanced allocation of
public money.
</P>
<P>
   We easily spend $1 million for every Tomahawk cruise missile
that we launch in the name of freedom _ 79 were used on two
facilities in Sudan and Afghanistan; 400 more were fired last week
against Iraq. But we haggle over and pinch every penny we give to
the poor and complain that we'll never solve the problem by
``throwing'' more money at it.
</P>
<P>
   What would $400 million do for the indigent mentally ill in this
country? What suffering could a mere $79 million alleviate?
</P>
<P>
   All around the psychotic woman, people hurried in and out of
shops and stores, making the most of extended holiday buying hours.
Few of them seemed to notice the poor soul; they were intent on
finding the right presents for the people they loved, loathed or
owed.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas. Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Happy Birthday, Jesus. I hate to tell you, but this year is
going to be like all the rest: You won't get the present you've
been waiting for.

AMERICA'S BUSINESS IS TOO LURID FOR AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Excuse me, but I have to get on with America's
business.
</P>
<P>
   That's what I keep hearing from everyone. Even right-wing pundit
Pat Buchanan wrote, ``Let's get it over with and get on with
America's business.'' He meant after a Senate impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   What is America's business? Entertainment, that's what.
</P>
<P>
   Lately America has been entertaining only for fans of theater of
the absurd, as performed by the inmates of the asylum of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   We've had too much of America's business, a show combining
Springer and Oprah, the National Enquirer and Hustler, ``Wag the
Dog'' and ``Groundhog Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ``Groundhog Day,'' we keep living through the same things
over and over again, but they get worse instead of better. If the
Senate doesn't cancel the impeachment trial, we're in for
thermonuclear ``Groundhog Day'' and we'll never come out from under
Monica's shadow.
</P>
<P>
   Let's get back to business and find some new entertainment.
Outing hypocrites in Washington is as easy as finding bad sitcoms
on television. I don't even care if Hustler has photos of Rep. Bob
Livingston, R-La., in leather scanties.
</P>
<P>
   Even the bombing of Iraq was presented as entertainment. After
showing the press the first video of a laser-guided bomb blasting a
building, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Hugh
Shelton, said: ``Now that I've whetted your appetite ...''
</P>
<P>
   He said it if it were a preview of a coming attraction rather
the end of some Iraqi lives, and the end of ways of dealing with
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``Degrade'' is the Clinton administration's latest word _ when
talking about destroying buildings in Baghdad, not the degradation
of our country.
</P>
<P>
   The airstrikes were perfectly coordinated with the impeachment.
This was bigger and more brazen than ``Wag the Dog.'' More like
``Wag the Elephant.''
</P>
<P>
   There are so many pat phrases. ``It's an issue of conscience.''
``It isn't about sex.''
</P>
<P>
   American political discourse is like a Furby. It's hateful,
unenlightening, unentertaining, and we keep hearing the same
nonsensical programmed sentences over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, though, there were some entertaining moments
during the insanity in Washington. It's a rare asylum that doesn't
provide some fascinating delusions.
</P>
<P>
   There was that great moment when the party of personal morality
got to its feet and applauded a congressman for being a serial
adulterer. However, they said they were applauding Livingston for
admitting it _ you know, just before it was going to be splashed
all over the press.
</P>
<P>
   His actions were different from Clinton's, they said. He didn't
perjure himself.
</P>
<P>
   However, Livingston broke what the right wing should believe is
a more important oath _ one made to his wife and to God.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to that stuff about the primacy of religion and
the sanctity of marriage? I guess you call this situational
sanctity. Make that situational sanctimoniousness.
</P>
<P>
   You can pin that one on Bill and Hillary, too. Talk about the
sanctimony of a marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary called for national reconciliation during the holiday
season of Christmas, Hanukkah and Ramadan. She said this while her
husband's bombs were falling on an Arab country.
</P>
<P>
   After the impeachment, Bill and Hillary held a show of
solidarity in the Rose Garden with all the Democrats who had stuck
up for them, despite the president's abandonment of those
Democrats' issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bill stuck out his lower lip to show contrition. Hillary did her
patented nod as Democrats said Clinton is one of our greatest
presidents. Moments before, the same Democrats were saying he
should be censured for acting ``reprehensibly'' and lying to the
American people.
</P>
<P>
   One of our greatest presidents? Well, Clinton is our most
resilient president. He's rubber and his enemies are glue.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a CNN/Gallup poll showed that Clinton's approval
rating had risen 10 points since the impeachment to 73 percent, a
higher rating than Ronald Reagan ever got.
</P>
<P>
   The approval rating of the Republican Party had sunk to 31
percent, just above Saddam Hussein's.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton is put on trial in the Senate, his ratings will go
higher than motherhood. After the next election, the Republican
Party could be on the side of milk cartons, ruining kids'
breakfasts.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all of them, Republican and Democrat, use the same
cliche. They say they don't govern by ratings, but vote their
consciences.
</P>
<P>
   These are politicians who don't make a move without a poll or a
focus group. If they voted their consciences, all their votes would
be abstentions.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment has been in short supply. But there are still a
few laughs, some nervous.
</P>
<P>
   As president pro tem of the Senate with no speaker of the House,
Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., is next in line for president after Al
Gore. No, Strom can't be president. Strom, 96, wasn't born in this
country. He was born in the Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   Then we have this news item: On Monday, Gore got back to
America's business and presided over the Plain Language Award
ceremonies at the White House, which honors people in government
for using plain English and avoiding double-talk.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wasn't there because it would be, well, inappropriate.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Here we go again _ just when you think things
are moving in a positive direction for the gay community, along
comes an issue religious conservatives hope will divide
Californians.
</P>
<P>
   Enough signatures were recently submitted to qualify the
``Defense of Marriage Act'' for the March 2000 ballot. The
initiative would ban same-sex marriages in California. Not since
the Briggs initiative, which attempted to ban gay and lesbian
teachers, has the gay community encountered a statewide issue with
such divisive implications.
</P>
<P>
   According to its proponents, this law is necessary because
several states could soon legalize same-sex marriages and
California might be required by constitutional law to recognize
those marriages as valid.
</P>
<P>
   Courts in only three states are reviewing the same-sex marriage
issue: Hawaii, Alaska and Vermont. Voters in both Hawaii and Alaska
recently approved initiatives by a 2 to 1 margin to ban same-sex
marriages, rendering moot any court action on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court of Vermont recently heard oral arguments on
the issue. A decision is expected within a few months. Clearly,
members of the religious right believe they have found a winning
issue in their efforts to divide society against the gay community.
</P>
<P>
   But don't get confused. This initiative is not about
``preserving'' the institution of traditional marriage. This
initiative is about crippling the gay community's efforts to
acquire basic rights long held by heterosexual couples.
</P>
<P>
   The gay community is not focused on same-sex marriages, as some
might believe, but has instead focused on the legal recognition of
domestic partnerships. In many communities and companies, domestic
partnerships have provided committed partners with necessary access
to health insurance, bereavement leave, family leave and retirement
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   It's a battle the gay community is winning in small and
incremental steps. Recognition of that fact has forced the
religious right to change the terms of the debate and go on the
offensive.
</P>
<P>
   With the religious right attempting to engage Californians on an
issue few are debating and a concept that many are not ready to
embrace, how should the gay community respond? Should we embark on
an intensive campaign to fight the initiative? Or should we focus
our resources on supporting candidates and legislation that will
lead to equal benefits for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered
people?
</P>
<P>
   The religious right is hoping this initiative will divide and
foster dissension within the gay community in California. We must
look beyond this divisive initiative so that the real work of
providing equal rights to members of the gay community will
continue to advance after March 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The gay community's strengths of resiliency and creativity will
be called upon in the coming months. The struggle for civil rights
is a long road. We have made extraordinary progress. This
initiative will not undo that progress. We must work diligently so
that this initiative does not divide us as its proponents intend to
divide California.
</P>
<P>
   Let us embrace the challenge together, work toward a common
response and speak proudly as one community.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ There is nothing more festive than the flash of
diamonds _ or the seductive shimmer of a high-lighted cheekbone or
the lure of a shoulder swathed in moonlit splendor.
</P>
<P>
   So, if it gleams, glitters, shines or sparkles, and it's not
diamonds, chances are, this holiday, it will show up on cheekbones,
eyelids, collarbones or deep in the decolletage via loose
microscopic foil paillettes, scintillating body gel or shimmer
stick.
</P>
<P>
   For this season's holiday parties and for New Year's Eve,
makeups are about living out your fantasies. Are you Pavlova,
jette-ing through the snow? Or Shiva, shimmering like a goddess in
candlelight? Do you want to twinkle with the exuberance of a
fairy-lit Christmas tree? Or sparkle like a Tiffany treasure?
</P>
<P>
   How you do it is up to you. For subtle shine, try Chanel's
Scintillances, an iridescent all-over body gel that goes where you
want it and stays all evening _ or really glitz it up with Yves
Saint Laurent's Pure Paillette Face Glitter, which captures light
(and attention).
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the eyes, the story is serious moonlight _ all
silvery sheen and glitter. Hard Candy's graphic Techno eyeshadow
has four different ways to gleam and shine with glittery black,
anthracite, iridescent silver and pearlized off-white. Or try
Stila's moon-sparkled single shadows like Moonlight or Starlight.
</P>
<P>
   For far-out fantasy, Yves Saint Laurent has created moonbeams
for the face with three grades of paillettes, ranging from pearly
nacres to silver spangles, brushed onto Blanc d'Argent (a
sparkling, silvery face highlighter). Lancome's micro-paillettes,
meanwhile, add surprise sparkle to the hair.
</P>
<P>
   So you glow, girl. And glitter. And shine. And sparkle all you
like. Maybe your significant other will take the hint and buy you
the real thing.

UN LEADER SEEKS NEW WAY TO MONITOR IRAQI WEAPONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary General Kofi Annan has formed a
high-level task force to consider supplanting the UN weapons
inspection unit in Iraq with a less aggressive arms control entity,
well-placed UN sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi task force, made up of Annan's chief advisers and UN
disarmament expert Jayantha Dhanapala, is studying a proposal to
shift the task of eliminating Iraq's chemical and biological
weapons to the Hague-based Organization for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons, which does not have the political baggage of the
UN Special Commission, or UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative is designed to mend the rifts in the sharply
divided Security Council in the wake of the US bombing campaign.
But it also signals the UN chief's deepening hostility toward
Richard Butler, the chairman of UNSCOM charged with ridding Iraq of
its long-range missiles and its chemical and biological weapons.
Butler has alienated many council members with his combative style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is not helpful that the council is divided,'' Annan
said Monday. ``I would hope that in the weeks ahead we will find a
way of bringing everyone together to that we can carry on the
essential work of the council.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would shift many of UNSCOM's responsibility for
eliminating Iraq's most lethal weapons to other groups. The
International Atomic Energy Agency, which enjoys a cordial working
relationship with Baghdad, would continue to monitor Iraq's nuclear
program. A third ad hoc inspection team would have to be created to
monitor Iraq's long-range missile program.
</P>
<P>
   ``These would continue to be intrusive inspections,'' said a
source familiar with the plan. But the new inspectors would not be
perceived as agents for the ``Anglo-Saxon intelligence club.
Therefore, politically it may be possible for this idea to fly.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior UN official cautioned that the proposal was only one
among at least half a dozen ideas being hashed out by Annan's
advisers. The source said that Annan has not endorsed any one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Several governments say `` `We need a new structure, we need a
new inspection mechanism,' '' said Annan, adding that he was
engaged in a series of high-level discussions with world leaders.
``I don't know what that means. ... But it will emerge after the
discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration said it is too early to consider
UNSCOM's replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's premature to speculate about that,'' said White House
national security spokesman David Leavy. ``We've said that what we
want is for UNSCOM to be able to go back in there, and if it's
effective that would be preferable.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan's political advisers say the UN chief is under pressure to
help formulate a post-bombing Iraq policy and to try to break the
impasse in the 15-nation Security Council, which created UNSCOM in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, China and France, eager to see Butler resign, would also
like to see a less confrontational weapons-monitoring regime return
to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain, while publicly committed to
Butler, have made it clear that they will no longer fight for his
survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see UNSCOM back,'' Britain deputy foreign minister
Derek Fatchett said. ``It would not be productive at this stage for
other countries to start trying to select the next head of UNSCOM.
We still have faith in Butler and we don't see that as a key agenda
item.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, France floated its own proposal to establish a less
intrusive version of the UN Special Commission, free of the
controversial surprise inspections that have offended the Iraqi
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The French proposal, considered a non-starter by American and
British diplomats, also calls for an end to economic sanctions. In
its place, the French envision a system of tight financial controls
designed to thwart the import or export of weapons-related
material.
</P>
<P>
   In its first meeting on Iraq since the American bombing campaign
ended, the Security Council failed to begin even preliminary
discussions on its long-term relationship with Iraq. Instead, the
Council simply released a bland statement pledging its intention to
``pursue this question actively.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz, meanwhile, said Monday
that Baghdad would never let UNSCOM back into the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment America and Britain launched missiles against Iraq
they killed UNSCOM,'' Aziz said. ``I cannot give them another
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler's relationship with the council and the UN chief has
eroded drastically over the current crisis with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and China -- angered by Butler's role in providing a
pretext for US bombing -- charged the Australian diplomat with
producing a distorted account of Iraq's efforts to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   While Butler defended his report as ``fair'' and ``objective,''
he has expressed concern that the missile attack on Baghdad may
ultimately cost him his job. Still, he has refused demands for his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Annan -- the man who appointed Butler to his job but does not
have the authority to fire him -- will not be sad to see him go,
according to UN sources.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Butler's future, Annan Monday responded: ``I think
that is a question I would prefer not to answer today.''

KEEP THE RITES STUFF IN THE RIGHT PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, as Joe DiMaggio lay failing in a Florida hospital, at
least two local TV newscasters reported that the 84-year-old
baseball legend had been read his last rites.
</P>
<P>
   To C. R. Krieger of Lowell, that sounded more like lawyering
than ministering, and he phoned one station, he reports, to take
issue with the wording. God may be willing to hear a deathbed
confession, writes Krieger, but generally He ``does not get into
the technical details of the Last Judgment and what could or could
not be used against one'' in the hereafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this a unique New England way of talking about the
administration of the sacrament of the sick?'' he wonders.
</P>
<P>
   No, this is not a regional oddity, but one that has
international reach, if not yet a firm grasp on the language. It
may have begun, as Krieger obviously suspects, with Miranda, the
1966 US Supreme Court ruling that gave birth to the mandatory
warning to suspects arrested by the police _ ``You have the right
to remain silent,'' and so on. Miranda's brave new world led
straight to the shorthand ``read him his Miranda rights'' (and
thence to mirandize _ now a tongue-in-cheek coinage, but stranger
verbs have come to stay).
</P>
<P>
   Last rites, unlike Miranda rights, were usually given or
administered _ and received, on the other end _ but they were
rarely read until quite recently. The first Globe citation is dated
1982, and it isn't about a person, but about the near-death
experiences of the postal system. (Last rites, it should be noted,
is the common but informal name for the Roman Catholic sacrament of
the anointing of the sick _ known as extreme unction until its
early-'60s name change.)
</P>
<P>
   But how much is Miranda to blame for the spread of reading the
last rites? There's plenty of reading in liturgical language, not
to mention everyday expressions like reading the riot act and
reading his lines; even without Miranda, such a shift might have
come. Some evidence to consider: reading the last rites now appears
in newspapers both in Canada, where suspects are also read their
rights, and in England, where they're more likely to be cautioned
by the arresting officer. There, as in the United States,
figurative uses come naturally: Welsh cricketers ``had to wait
until the final whistle to read the last rites on an Argentina side
that twice mounted fightbacks of ferocious intensity.''
(Fightbacks? I'm only quoting, not endorsing.)
</P>
<P>
   Reading the last rites is not, however, sweeping the
English-speaking nations; it's moving at a creep, and probably
should be resisted, at least when applied to people. Its echo of
law-enforcement lingo _ especially when the phrase is used on radio
and TV, where rites and rights are indistinguishable _ evokes the
image of a dying person being handcuffed and hauled off to jail.
Judgment may be imminent, either way, but on grounds of taste alone
it's worth keeping our rights and rites in their separate realms.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Good and plenty
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the last rites are administered, condolences are often in
order. But some people apparently dole them out grudgingly: Two
correspondents in the past year have objected to the plural form,
insisting that condolence is not only sufficient, but correct.
</P>
<P>
   This was a new one on me. Condolences, like most expressions of
cheer or sympathy, are most often expressed as plurals:
felicitations, congratulations, best wishes, my sympathies, and
many happy returns of the day, that mysterious mantra learned from
``Winnie-the-Pooh.'' Even the aliens say, ``Greetings,
Earthlings.''
</P>
<P>
   So I was glad to find no evidence supporting the
condolence-singular restriction. Yes, you may refer to letters of
condolence, but when you are condoling or congratulating, you need
not stint on amounts. ``Often plural,'' says the dictionary entry
on condolence, and Dickens, among other worthies, did it that way.
If you don't have enough condolences to go around, my sympathies _
but grammar and usage give you no excuse for hoarding them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   'Tis time for a rest
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You'd think it's and its were enough trouble for English
speakers, but every year _ we can't seem to help ourselves _ we
revive the archaic 'tis and make its tired old bones dance for
another season. If you must use it (and journalists are among the
most vulnerable to its charms), remember that it's a contraction of
it is. Do not say, as one national magazine did last year,
``Christmas 'tis the season to be jolly.'' It definitely 'tis not
correct.

`PRINCE' FALLS SHORT OF PROMISED LAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When all was said and done, moviegoers preferred e-mail to the
Book of Exodus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prince of Egypt,'' Dreamworks SKG's first step into
traditionally animated film, could only muster a second-place
finish in its opening weekend, behind ``You've Got Mail,'' starring
Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. The romantic comedy, a cyberspace update of
Ernst Lubitsch's 1940 charmer, ``The Shop Around The Corner,''
earned about $18.7 million, compared to ``Prince's'' $14.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   For most films, that would be a more-than-respectable opening.
But for Dreamworks's three kings -- filmmaker Steven Spielberg,
former Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg, and all-purpose mogul
David Geffen -- it has to be considered a less-than-princely sum.
In yesteday's box office roundup, Associated Press called
``Prince's'' take, ``solid, but unspectacular, business.''
Dreamworks's distribution chief Jim Tharp claimed the studio was
``very satisfied'' with the opening. Still, one has to wonder just
how satisfied they can be, considering it's rumored to be the most
expensive animated film ever, with estimates between $70 million
and $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't possibly be what they hoped for, or even what the
industry expected,'' said Martin Grove, movie analyst for CNN and
the Hollywood Reporter. ``The general buzz has been (Dreamworks)
was looking for about a $25 million opening, and Hollywood people
were talking about a $20 million opening. It was not a disaster,
but this was a very expensive movie, and a very important movie for
Dreamworks, and this has to be viewed as somewhat disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the biblical story of Moses, ``The Prince of Egypt''
was one of the most-hyped and anticipated films of the year. With
state-of-the-art animation, a swarm of stars -- Val Kilmer, Ralph
Fiennes Sandra Bullock, Michelle Pfeiffer, Danny Glover, Patrick
Stewart, Jeff Goldblum, Helen Mirren, Steve Martin, and Martin
Short -- lent their voices to the project. In recent months, it's
been impossible to turn a corner without seeing the golden
silhouette of the man who would be the deliverer of the Hebrews.
</P>
<P>
   The film opened in more than 3,000 theaters, and Dreamworks
offered three different soundtracks, only one with music from the
film _ that one has the dueling divas duet of Whitney Houston and
Mariah Carey performing, ``When You Believe.'' The other two
feature music ``inspired'' by the film: a Nashville CD featuring
such artists as Wynonna, Randy Travis, Vince Gill, and Alison
Krauss; and a gospel CD with, among others, Shirley Caesar, Kirk
Franklin, and Brian McKnight.
</P>
<P>
   The hype machine was in full effect because ``The Prince of
Egypt'' was venturing where no other animated film had gone before
_ a deadly serious topic, the emancipation of Hebrew slaves from
bondage in Egypt. Children are slaughtered or perish in plagues.
Slaves are beaten. Thousands of Egyptian soldiers are swallowed by
the wrath of God, courtesy of the Red Sea. It's a Sunday school
lesson disguised as family entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, with such works as ``Jesus Christ Superstar'' and
``Godspell,'' stories based in the Bible have always been a fertile
ground for popular entertainment, Katzenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think doing something with a sense of respect and
integrity, and making something entertaining as being mutually
exclusive,'' he said recently. ``I didn't see that as a conflict
from the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   This is an ``adult animated film,'' with a PG rating, Katzenberg
said, bucking the trend toward cute singing creatures and catchy
ditties custom-made for kids. There are no singing camels (there
was one, but it got dusted before the final cut), no dancing
Sphinxes sashaying along the Nile. ``The Prince of Egypt'' flies in
the face of seven decades of G-rated film animation, a form Disney
all but created and perfected. Considered that way, the film may
have actually exceeded expectations, Grove said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To open an adult-appeal animated feature to nearly $15 million
is not chopped liver,'' he said. ``Conceptually, they made a movie
which was animated, but not targeted to kids, and that is a radical
departure.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg recently admitted to bouts of ``panic'' concerning
how the film would be received. In a revealing moment, he said,
``To change 70 years' of perception is an impossible, well, almost
impossible task. . . well, I hope it's not completely impossible,
otherwise we're in trouble.'' Given the subject matter, the film
couldn't even be marketed in the traditional ways _ in other words,
no Moses Happy Meals or Rameses coloring books. Said Katzenberg,
``This isn't like most animated films, so it would be wrong to
market it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the main reason Katzenberg, along with such stars as
Kilmer, Bullock, and Goldblum, came to New York himself to promote
the film _ after all, how often do studio heads leave their comfy
Hollywood confines to chat up reporters 3,000 miles away?
</P>
<P>
   If ``Prince of Egypt'' continues to falter at the box office,
Dreamworks won't go belly up _ they also had such hit films as
``Deep Impact,'' ``Antz,'' and ``Saving Private Ryan'' this year.
But Katzenberg bled for this film. He was a Disney bigwig,
overseeing their animation resurrection with such films as ``The
Little Mermaid,'' ``Beauty and the Beast,'' ``Aladdin,'' and ``The
Lion King.'' Several years ago, he had an acrimonious split with
Disney, in particular its chief Michael Eisner, and went on to
found Dreamworks. So make no mistake, Katzenberg wanted to hit his
former employer where they live _ namely, in the animation field.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the film's opening, Katzenberg said he was content that
the filmmakers had ``done our best work, whatever the outcome of it
is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether people like it or not, there's nothing I can do about
it now,'' he said. ``I think we achieved the goal we set up to do,
and I only hope it's a goal that has a happy ending.''

   STOUGHTON, Mass. _ In her basement, the storybook souvenir of
Elizabeth Goffredo's wedding day lies in a rotting heap of warped
album sleeves and eaten images. Swirls of mold crack the poised
faces and crimson dresses of her 1966 wedding party.
</P>
<P>
   The prized memento, broken at its spine, sits among the lifetime
of ruined possessions left behind after water gushed into the house
in 1996 and flooded the Goffredos' family room.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, flooding continued, like a recurring
nightmare. But it was still just water _ nothing compared to the
news the Goffredos got last June, after a curious official at a
town meeting suggested testing the funny-colored liquid in their
home.
</P>
<P>
   Only then did the family learn that the water they had waded in
repeatedly, trying to save their floating belongings, was
contaminated by a cancer-causing toxin. And then the real battles
began.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years after the Love Canal, suburban toxic waste
continues to seep through the suburbs. From Ashland _ where a plume
of contaminated ground water from the Nyanza Superfund site has
swept into the town's Main Street and 33 miles down the Sudbury
River _ to an abandoned 19th-century farmhouse on the banks of the
Housatonic River in Lenox, now uninhabitable because of PCBs,
chemicals continue to unleash toxic elements like silent time
bombs.
</P>
<P>
   In Stoughton, as flooding gave way to contamination in the
Goffredos' basement, the family was introduced to
1,1,1-trichloroethane _ a toxic degreasing solvent that was banned
in 1996 after scientists found that it tore into the Earth's ozone
layer. Tests showed the flood water, apparently contaminated by
waste from a nearby company, contained concentrations 32 times
higher than the state's ``reporting limits.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was more: The chemical had dissipated into the air,
and not just in the basement. Air samples collected there in
November 1998 by the Department of Environmental Protection showed
the solvent at 335 times acceptable state levels, but in the
kitchen, and further upstairs in the bedroom of the Goffredos'
28-year-old son Chris, the levels were higher still.
</P>
<P>
   More samples were taken from the next three houses up the hill
from 383 Canton. The results, all showing high levels of the same
solvent, finally forced the Goffredos and two of the other families
out of their homes and into the Stoughton Courtyard Marriot last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as most people chase down last-minute gifts, the neighbors
of Canton Street are preparing for holidays without homes. And all
the while, as flooding continues, the finished basement that had
sold the Goffredos and their two almost-grown children on the
small, Cape-style house in 1992 slowly becomes a fortress of
filters, looped hoses, and industrial-size pumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically lived and worked for that house. That's the
bottom line,'' said Elizabeth Goffredo, a 54-year-old cook. Her
shoulders, hunched under a drooping cable sweater, hold all the
crushing fatigue and repeated shocks of her family's ordeal.
``There were plans. We did improvements. That house was going to be
the inheritance, the thing we passed along to our children. Now,
we're paying a mortgage on a house that is worth nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, the flooding exhausted them. Every rainstorm
turned their yard into a moat. No matter where they turned _ the
Fire Department, Public Works, Town Hall _ their pleas for help
seemingly went unheard.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier this week, speaking from the beige-colored hotel
lounge they call their living room, William, Elizabeth, Chris, and
Marisa Goffredo said they almost wish they could go back to the
time when a wet basement was their only fret.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we had a flooding problem,'' said Elizabeth
Goffredo. ``Now here we are with blood tests, my son going to
doctor after doctor, my daughter having skin problems she never had
before. And after all the fighting this family has over this, the
bottom line is we are barely capable of being civil to each other.
I spend a lot of time trying to blank it out.''
</P>
<P>
   As they embark on a sluggish, sometimes exhausting effort to
prod state environmental officials and the potentially liable
companies near their homes into action, they face the same
multi-pronged struggle of neighbors across suburban Massachusetts,
who woke up one day to learn decades-old pollution had seeped
through their walls, and found themselves fighting officials,
corporations, and even disease as they lost their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stoughton is a good example of government and companies not
acting until there was a severe crisis,'' said Matthew Wilson,
director of Toxics Action Center in Boston. ``Here is this innocent
family, physically bombarded by this situation and psychologically
saying to themselves, `Have I been breathing this for six years? Am
I going to be able to have kids?' It's debilitating and
frustrating. And then you have to go the extra step and convince
people that something is really wrong and something has to be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials say the Stoughton case cannot be likened to
environmental disasters like the one in Woburn, where contamination
was linked to the deaths of six children from leukemia and led to
an $8 million settlement in 1986 on behalf of eight families. The
flight of the three Stoughton families, officials say, was a
voluntary evacuation, not a mandatory one.
</P>
<P>
   But in at least one respect, officials say, the Stoughton case
is alarming: While trichloroethanes and other synthetic solvents
have contaminated many state wells, rarely have the affected flood
waters led to toxic airborne levels of the chemical inside homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we're not the only family or town going through
this, or that has gone through this,'' said Chris Goffredo, a
consultant for a medical software company who was shocked when he
read a fact sheet on the invisible toxins in his home.
</P>
<P>
   Symptom for symptom, the list of possible health effects matched
his unexplained dizzy spells, loss of balance, and sudden twitching
attacks that began a year after his family moved into the house in
1992. The various illnesses have led Chris Goffredo to undergo a
battery of tests, from liver biopsies to CAT scans, and chasing a
trail of doctors with increasing specialities but little
understanding of what ails him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You almost feel like the system is against you,'' he said,
``because the companies have so much time to come up with a cleanup
plan, and give the plan to the DEP, and have it reviewed and so on
and so on before anything actually happens. And meanwhile you're
sitting there agonizing about how these chemicals may have set
something off inside you, or if they will some time in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials say it is too early to pinpoint which of several
area companies is the source of the contamination. One company,
Brookfield Engineering Laboratories, has been paying the hotel
stays of the three families, though it has said that does not mean
it accepts liability.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, the Goffredos and their two hotel-bound
neighbors, the Syke family and Judy Killday, have retained an
environmental lawyer, hoping for a settlement deal that will allow
area companies to buy their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of whatever they could put in the house to lower
the contamination, we don't want to move back,'' said Chris
Goffredo. ``We want to be relocated, permanently.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for the three families, their fight has been complicated by
the fact that a fourth neighbor, Lawrence Flanagan, a retired Bell
Atlantic technician who has lived on the street for 23 years, has
chosen not to move.
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan, an assuming, ruddy-faced man who lives alone after a
long separation and divorce, accepted a Bell Atlantic buyout option
in January at age 53. He has seen too many of his friends become
sick or die before they could enjoy retirement, he said, and now,
only a forced evacuation could make him leave the home where he
planned to spend the rest of his years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up all my life in Canton, but when I just got married,
I couldn't afford a house there,'' said Flanagan, leaning into the
fraying brown afghan draped his favorite corduroy easy chair. ``So
I did the second-best thing: I bought a house in Stoughton, on
Canton Street. . . . Everyone has a different thing. They want to
get out. I don't. I want to get home and start my retirement. And I
can't do that until this thing is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Local and state officials now believe what the Goffredo family
said they suspected for years: that construction of an access road
built by one of the businesses behind their home triggered the
flooding. The road, ordered by the Fire Department, leveled a
wooded boundary next to the Goffredos that once soaked up
rainwater. And it left a less-than-solid dirt path that eroded into
a bowl-like pond and collected water until it overflowed.
</P>
<P>
   What the Goffredos and their neighbors never suspected was that
the construction would break a storm drain that carried water to a
tributary of the Neponset River, allowing decades-old toxic
chemicals to evaporate into the outside air.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Goffredos say, it is almost impossible for them to
believe that their home could ever be made safe permanently.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, you feel like, what is the point of going on with
this?'' said Chris Goffredo. ``Except that in another way, you also
feel how can you not do anything? That was our home. Until we find
a way to move on, it is our home.''

PAWNBROKERS FIND A NICHE AMONG BARGAIN-HUNTING SHOPPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE COSTANTINOU  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Need a last-minute something special for
Christmas? How about a Wedgewood china urn, half price at only
$1,000? Or a $22,900 cane handle that just happens to be a
diamond-and-ruby Faberge egg?
</P>
<P>
   Need a stocking-stuffer? There's a 1994 Jaguar XJS convertible
that has 24-karat gold plate trim down to its wire wheel spokes.
It's yours for the incredible price of $28K. OK, for you, only
$25K.
</P>
<P>
   These and other treasures can be had at pawnshops in the San
Francisco area, where a growing number of holiday shoppers are
finding all sorts of stuff at prices far less than what they would
pay in a regular retail shop.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most of the items are not exactly brand-new. They've
been around the block a few times.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no such thing as used jewelry,'' said Ken Blumenthal,
42, a fourth-generation pawnbroker who runs Best Collateral.
``Diamonds and gold are already a million years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``A diamond will sparkle no matter who you bought it from,
whether you got it at Best or at Shreve's.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as Neil Bronstein, 45, of Pacific Loan &AMP; Jewelry, tells
novice pawnshoppers: ``With a little jewelers' rouge, a polishing
wheel and a little steam-cleaning, you'd never know it was new or
used. Put it in a nice box, and a gift recipient is not going to
ask, `Is this new or is it from a pawnshop?'''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, shopping on line or by catalog might be more convenient.
And there's something about the hustle-bustle of downtown and the
malls that somehow screams Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, savvy shoppers, from the poor to the
well-to-do, have been turning to pawnshops _ and other secondhand
places, like consignment shops, flea markets, thrift shops and
antiques shops _ not only for bargain prices but for that special,
unique item.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed in the pawnshop business, pawnbrokers say.
Although some still have that woe-is-me, jumbled look, many are
family-run businesses trying to upgrade their image, with the
jewelry lined neatly in velvet trays and the television sets wiped
of dust and oglers' fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   At Express Auto Pawn, the only place to pawn a car in San
Francisco, 57-year-old owner Dan Miller looks like a college
professor in his white button-down shirt, olive corduroy pants,
sweater vest and penny loafers. His whitewashed showroom _
featuring a red 1967 Mustang convertible for $6,388 (Blue Book
retail price $12,000), and a 1962 white Lincoln convertible with
suicide doors for $7,588 (Blue Book $10,100) _ is spotless.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have this old idea of a pawnshop _ you know, everything
is stolen, bars on the window,'' said Allen Notowitz, 60, owner of
Numis International in Millbrae. ``It's not like that. My door's
open. My store is well lit. My son wears a tie.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the seediest thing about many pawnshops is their
environs. As for the shops' reputation for being full of stolen
goods, pawnbrokers point out that everyone who comes in with
something to hock must show valid identification and be
fingerprinted.
</P>
<P>
   The person's name and address, and a description of the item,
including serial and model numbers, are then entered on a computer
and sent to the police.
</P>
<P>
   Few thieves are willing to take that risk, the brokers said. And
neither are they. Michael Krasow, 48, of Pacific Loan, said that if
people walked in with an expensive camera or watch, and he didn't
know a thing about them, they would be turned away, no matter how
tempting the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Jewelry is appraised and electronic equipment is checked out to
make sure it works, pawnbrokers said. And to further calm
customers' fears, many pawnshops offer to give refunds if the
jewelry isn't what they represented or the electronics had a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Most customers are repeat business. Others find them from
word-of-mouth. The owners say happy customers mean more to them in
the long run than a one-time sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``To show you how much the business has changed, we guarantee
everything 100 percent, or your money back,'' said Ralph Kazanjian,
73, of Midtown Loan Office. ``The object is to have the customer
come back, not only at Christmastime.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, have some candy,'' added his wife, Elise, 63, picking up
a tray from the sales counter and offering chocolates to a visitor.
</P>
<P>
   Although most customers are on tight budgets and can't afford to
pay full retail prices, pawnbrokers said it was not unusual to see
men in business suits or women carrying Nordstrom bags check out
the prices on Rolexes and estate jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't one walk of life that I haven't had,'' Miller
said.
</P>
<P>
   Under California law, pawnbrokers must hold onto the goods for
four months and 10 days. By then, if the owner doesn't pay off at
least the interest, the pawnbroker can put the hocked item up for
sale as unclaimed property. Interest rates are regulated by the
state. For example, on a $1,000 loan, interest would be $125.25.
About 10 to 20 percent of all hocked items are forfeited.

SENSIBLE SIGNALS FROM THE SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; -- As baton passes go, House-to-Senate on the
impeachment of President Clinton is one for the ages. It isn't
often, after all, that the fresh runner drops the baton on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   But that is what has happened.
</P>
<P>
   Already a bipartisan consensus has formed in the Senate around
an understandable proposition: that what happened in the House must
not be allowed to happen there.
</P>
<P>
   It is a proposition that shatters party lines and inclinations
about the president's culpability. Its public expression is the
obvious _ that this case in its current condition is incapable of
attracting the 67 votes necessary for conviction and removal and
probably would barely attract 45 Republican votes.
</P>
<P>
   But in private, senators from both parties and both inclinations
believe that the Senate would be embarrassed by a full presentation
of the House case in its current condition and without major new
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the only considerations that would keep the case from
being settled before a trial can begin are a respect for those
members who firmly believe censure is a copout or a bad precedent;
a lack of certainty about any new evidence; and a desire to avoid
institutional humiliation of the House by failing to hear at least
the beginning of its case.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, and directly flouting Majority Leader Trent Lott's
wishes, conversations about quick resolution are already occurring
across the aisle and involving such players as Lott's fellow
Mississippian, Thad Cochran, Utah's Orrin Hatch, and Pennsylvania's
Arlen Specter.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything _ including a stunning batch of polls that
show record Clinton job approval, rejection of the House's action,
the opposite of a groundswell for resignation, and no appetite for
a trial _ the Senate's initial view of the House's case is
negative, for three main reasons:
</P>
<P>
   --In the view of senators, those roll call votes on Saturday
were not some political multiple-choice exercise. In passing two
articles and rejecting two, the House is seen as having greatly
changed the nature of the case presented by Ken Starr and rewritten
by Henry Hyde's Judiciary Committee Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The case presented by Starr and committee lawyer David Schippers
was a seamless web of alleged perjury _ stretching from the Paula
Jones case deposition 11 months ago, through the grand jury
appearance in August and through Clinton's 81 cocky answers to 81
set-up questions from Hyde in November.
</P>
<P>
   On the floor, however, 28 Republicans created a majority that
eliminated the article alleging perjury in the civil suit
deposition; and fully 81 Republicans voted to toss the article
framed around the 81 presidential answers. What was left was a
borderline silly case, lacking a bill of particulars, about
Clinton's state of mind in August and in January and the disputed
details of physical contact. The House in effect rejected the
evidentiary basis of its case and left us with trivia.
</P>
<P>
   --Article III presents the Senate with an even thornier set of
problems. As a case alleging obstruction of justice, each of its
seven elements requires the drawing of inferences on the basis of
circumstantial evidence as opposed to direct, He Did It, testimony.
Worse, each of the major prosecution witnesses on these topics
would make the defense's case on cross-examination because they
agree with it.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is legitimate question about the political
force and meaning of the House vote on the article itself.
Advocates of impeachment note that it would not have passed by its
221-212 margin had not five Democrats voted for it. However, it is
more important that it would not have passed without the votes of
five Republicans and one Democrat whose positions will be taken in
the new Congress by people who would have voted the other way.
</P>
<P>
   The legal issue posed by lame duck actions of such a momentous
nature are for other geniuses to decide. But the political fact is
that Article III arrives in the Senate with but a toe-hold on
political legitimacy, and yet by its complex nature it is the one
sure route to a lengthy trial.
</P>
<P>
   --Few noticed, but in the Senate there also remains doubt over
the next Congress's commitment to the case the expiring House
voted.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, 228 members voted for the ministerial job of naming
managers for the Senate case, hiring staff, and the like. This act
will have to be repeated next month.
</P>
<P>
   Off the top, take away five lame duck Republicans and one
Democrat (Paul McHale). Then, notice that two GOP members who voted
against all four impeachment articles (New York's Peter King and
Maryland's Connie Morella) nonetheless gave their ``leadership'' a
vote on this measure.
</P>
<P>
   Already, you're talking about a vote that could easily be as
close as Article III and is certain to be the object of continued
Democratic resistance because of anger at being denied the right to
vote on a censure alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Senators, in short, are doing much more than displaying their
customary caution, process fixation, and independence. They think
that they are being passed something that is much more like a dead
fish than a baton, and they are right.

IN THE HOUSE, PARTIES WOULD WELCOME LESSONS ON CIVILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the turbulent eve of the impeachment debate, as
American warplanes soared toward Baghdad for the first night of
attack and the Capitol melted into disarray, Representative Ray
LaHood convened a meeting to talk about another topic with
implications far into the next term.
</P>
<P>
   Friendliness.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives, it seemed, was in danger of
becoming nastier in 1999 than it had been the term before, even as
the battle over the president's fate moved on to the Senate. And so
as he prepared to preside over the House impeachment debate, LaHood
spent part of last week planning ``Hershey II,'' the second
Pennsylvania weekend retreat designed to ``promote civility'' on
both sides of the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are probably a lot of hard feelings on both
sides,'' the Illinois Republican said Monday in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   According to some House members, particularly Democrats, the
leftover rancor may in fact be paralyzing.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts described a
``profound'' polarization between the two parties. Representative
Martin T. Meehan of Massachusetts said the mood was ``the worst
I've ever seen it.'' Representative Edward J. Markey of
Massachusetts predicted ``the House will not be able to function,''
primarily because the president may be standing trial nearby in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the partisanship will be at such a heightened level
that the animosity and the bitterness that we saw over the past
weekend will poison the atmosphere,'' Markey said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After months of bitter arguing, culminating in a failed attempt
to block an impeachment vote last Saturday, Democrats appear to be
in no mood to make concessions to the GOP, some lawmakers said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, statistically, the Republican majority can hardly
afford to ignore the Democrats when the time comes to pass
legislation. House Republicans in effect have a majority of only 11
votes _ a margin so small that a six-vote swing could make or break
a bill.
</P>
<P>
   Frank predicted a near-stalemate in the 106th Congress, blaming
the ``extraordinary triumph of ideology'' of the right wing of the
Republican Party in passing two articles of impeachment despite
contrary public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not people who feel they have to make concessions,''
Frank said. ``I don't understand it. I don't know where they think
the votes are going to come from.''
</P>
<P>
   House leaders had hoped former Speaker-designate Robert L.
Livingston might forge bonds with the Democrats, using his
friendships across the aisle to temper the party bitterness that
has ebbed and flowed since Newt Gingrich took the job in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But with Livingston's stunning resignation, and Representative
Dennis Hastert, the apparent new speaker-to-be, a relative unknown,
several lawmakers said they were even less optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still ache with sadness over Bob's decision and what it says
about where we are in American politics right now,'' said David E.
Skaggs, a Colorado Democrat who helped initiate the Hershey retreat
and is retiring after 12 years. ``Bob believed completely in the
need for that kind of'' bipartisan ``work around here, and would
have put his strong personal and enthusiastic backing into it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are scattered rays of bipartisan hope: Meehan said he is
continuing his efforts to work with Republicans toward campaign
finance overhaul and is planning to meet at the White House Jan. 5
with Republican Senators John McCain of Arizona and Christopher
Shays of Connecticut to discuss legislative proposals. The outcome
will mark the ``first real test'' of how badly divided the parties
are, Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   Representative John E. Sununu, a Republican from New Hampshire,
also said he believed legislation could successfully work its way
through the House now that the impeachment vote is over _ but only
if the White House were to drop its resistance to cooperating with
the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he sensed little bitterness, only ``somberness and
seriousness,'' Sununu said Social Security reform would succeed if
President Clinton were able to demonstrate a ``willingness to work
with Congress by putting forward a proposal of principles that he
would like to see behind any reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet most Democrats admitted that true bipartisanship would be
difficult for the duration of a trial in the Senate, which could
begin next month. Only if the trial ended quickly _ and,
presumably, in acquittal _ could the House have a productive
session and a reduction in the tensions that exploded in the last
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Paul C. Light, the former director of Pew Charitable Trusts who
helped arrange the Hershey retreat in 1997, said he expected the
olive branches to begin extending slowly from each party by the
time the next retreat convenes at the end of March. He also said he
expected the lessons on civility to be better attended this time
than last.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody likes the way things are here, from a human standpoint.
It's pretty ugly,'' he said. ``I think there's sort of a basic
political desire to restore equilibrium. I don't think either party
wants to maintain a state of constant siege for the next two
years.''

CLINTON, DOWN FOR THE COUNT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN McGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You're Bill Clinton, and on that Saturday afternoon when destiny
and history meet on the floor of the House of Representatives, you
huddle in the Oval Office with your spiritual adviser, praying for
the country, praying for forgiveness, praying for yourself. And
when there are no more prayers to say, you wander down the hall to
your private dining room, sit with a pair of your most loyal aides,
and solemnly watch as the votes are cast to impeach you.
</P>
<P>
   You're Bill Clinton, and can you really believe it was just six
winters ago when you arrived in Washington in a caravan of buses
loaded with hundreds of your closest friends _ a day when Fleetwood
Mac filled the air, laughter echoed off the monuments, and your
hopes soared beyond even your most daring dreams?
</P>
<P>
   You're Bill Clinton, and you strove to be nothing short of the
seminal figure of your generation, the usher for a new era of
American politics, a leader who planned to bridge the great divides
of age, gender, class, and race, to bring new purpose to a
government stale from 12 years of Republican control.
</P>
<P>
   You're Bill Clinton, and every person you meet, you feel the
visceral need to charm; every moment is an event to seek advantage.
In the remotest village of China, you gladhand a shopkeeper as if
he might have something to give. In a limousine ride with a
reporter, you finish your conversation long after the car has
stopped and aides wait impatiently outside. In the Oval Office, you
excitedly demonstrate how Buddy will jump up and lick your face.
</P>
<P>
   You're Bill Clinton, and you once had a following so legion they
had their own nickname. Friends of Bill, they used to call them,
FOBs, people of prominence and purpose, people who believed in you,
who understood that you possessed gifts other politicians couldn't
even comprehend.
</P>
<P>
   You're Bill Clinton and you always lived for the moment, because
the moment always seemed so easy to live. You rewrote State of the
Union speeches in the car on the way to the Capitol. You ruined
schedules with long conversations. You had relationships with women
you thought would honor your privacy. And always there was someone
willing to protect you.
</P>
<P>
   You're Bill Clinton and you're wondering where all your oldest
friends have gone, why your phone doesn't ring as much anymore. You
once had the post office create your own zip code at the White
House so that friends could correspond privately with you, get
beyond the bureaucracy. Now, those letters of support come from
people you've never met.
</P>
<P>
   You're Bill Clinton and you always did whatever you had to do to
stay a step ahead of those evil and envious forces out to bring you
down. You did it for the nation, for all those people who looked to
you as their agent of change. Sometimes you had to tell lies, but
the lies were always told for the greater good. You lied about
Gennifer Flowers because she didn't matter. You lied about the
draft because it wasn't relevant. You lied about Monica Lewinsky
because the truth hurt and the public loves you.
</P>
<P>
   You're Bill Clinton, and there has been a six-year path of
destruction left in your wake. One friend killed himself. Others
went to jail. Too many aides to count have been saddled with five-
and even six-figure legal bills, hauled before a grand jury
investigating every crevice of your life. But what is it that you
were supposed to do?
</P>
<P>
   You're Bill Clinton and no president has ever had to withstand
the scrutiny you've withstood, has ever been the target of a vast
right-wing conspiracy as you have been.
</P>
<P>
   You're Bill Clinton, and the only cause you represent now is
yourself. There is little time to fight for issues anymore, not for
health care, not for education, not for racial healing. Even your
so-called supporters express shame of you. Your aides have little
to talk to you about. The fight, they say, isn't about you now, but
about the Constitution, and that singular argument carries all your
strategists through these darkest of days.
</P>
<P>
   You're Bill Clinton, and despite all your political gifts, all
your intelligence, you will be linked across the ages with Richard
Nixon and Andrew Johnson, your legacy forever defined by
impeachment. You throw up your hands and blame others for taking
such public advantage of your private indiscretion. Inside the
White House, you have begun telling a joke to anyone who will
listen. There is a man touring the Grand Canyon and he slips on a
rock and falls off a cliff. He grabs hold of a thin branch, and
looks down at the 1,000-foot fall. He bellows, ``God, why me? Why
me?'' And a voice booms from the sky: ``Son, there's just something
about you I don't like.''
</P>
<P>
   You're Bill Clinton, and you can only wonder why.
</P>

`OZ FOR ME IS JUST A MAGICAL PLACE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOIS SHEA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MERRIMACK, N.H._ Pat Matthias &UR;  &LR; has been collecting Wizard of Oz
memorabilia for more than 30 years. It started with the soundtrack,
album, which she memorized. Now, curio cabinets in her home are
bursting with Oz paraphernalia. And Matthias has moved beyond
memorizing the soundtrack. Now, she says, she can recite the entire
film. She estimates she has seen it 500 times.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the 60th anniversary of the 1939 release of the
movie, and the re-release in theatres, Matthias has decked the
halls for the holidays with mementos from the world of Oz. Her
Christmas tree is covered entirely with ``Wizard'' decorations. A
winding yellow ribbon symbolizes the yellow brick road, and
decorations (many homemade) depict scenes from the movie. There is
the tornado, the poppy field, the Glinda bubble, the melted Wicked
Witch of the West. The tree is topped with a sparkling Emerald City
made from test tubes, green Christmas lights and plumbing supplies.
Matthias spoke with Globe Staff writer Lois R. Shea about her
lifelong obsession with ``The Wizard of Oz.'' Following is An
edited version of their conversation follows.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'd have to say, my earliest recollection (of seeing the Wizard
of Oz) was probably 1960. And then I had a dear friend in grammar
school, we have been best friends since kindergarten, and she was
the only child in my class to own a color television set. And back
in the early '60s, ``The Wizard of Oz'' was an annual event. . . .
And she started inviting her friends to come every year and watch
the ``The Wizard of Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   We always got dressed up in party dresses. This was a big thing.
I remember bringing Oreos. And watching the movie and coming home
to a cot that was in my mother's and father's bedroom because the
witch scared me to death. I would have nightmares, and go right
back the next year and watch it again.
</P>
<P>
   The Scarecrow . . . he was the most lovable character. I would
say Dorothy would take second. But the Scarecrow was the one that
really got your heart.
</P>
<P>
   But once I had that album, I memorized the entire soundtrack. I
could sit there and without missing a beat, sing every song, talk
like Dorothy with every inflection, do the Witch of the West. I'll
do a whole scene:
</P>
<P>
   (Uncle Henry): Well, howdy, Miss Gulch.
</P>
<P>
   (Miss Gulch): I want to see you and your wife right away about
Dorothy.
</P>
<P>
   (Henry): Dorothy? Well, what has Dorothy done?
</P>
<P>
   (Gulch): Well, what has she done? Why, I'm all but lame from the
bite on my leg.
</P>
<P>
   (Henry): Oh, you mean she bit you?
</P>
<P>
   (Gulch): No, her dog.
</P>
<P>
   (Henry): Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
</P>
<P>
   (Gulch): No. That dog's a menace to the community. I'm taking
him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   (Dorothy): Destroyed? Toto? Oh, you can't. You musn't. Uncle
Henry, Auntie Em, don't let her take Toto. Don't let her take him,
please, stop!
</P>
<P>
   I had a hard time identifying why I was so passionate about this
film. . . . One of the things, I am a singer. Judy Garland was a
singer. She had an amazing potential as a star and destroyed her
life with alcohol and drugs. And that's the common bond. I am a
recovering alcoholic. I've been sober for seven years. . . . One of
the reasons people drink . . . you know, it's sort of like
alcoholics live in a fantasy world and things are always better
somewhere else other than your life. And Oz for me is just a
magical place.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe subconsciously I was more involved in this movie before I
really knew the reason why . . .
</P>
<P>
   Everything I always had was within myself. I had to go through
the experience of going (on) a journey, thinking this was better,
that was better, meeting evil, making some really not-so-good
choices . . .
</P>
<P>
   I'm finding that all of the answers were within myself, which is
basically the story. (Dorothy) always had the power to get back to
Kansas, but she had to learn that for herself.
</P>
<P>
   I was disappointed in the remaking of the movie for a couple of
reasons. . . . ``The Wizard of Oz'' and ``Gone With the Wind'' were
two of the first movies that were filmed in Technicolor. So the
whole technology of filming in color was very primitive. And by
digitizing the film, they enhanced the differences between scenes.
And . . . it didn't fit the screen. I envisioned this big-screen
``Wizard of Oz.'' And . . . the bigger the screen, you can see
there are places where the Lion's tail is wired. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I feel we're going to lose (the long-held appreciation for the
movie), just by virtue of accessibility to the film. . . . And by
having this media age with videotapes for every movie, all of these
things lose their meaning.

DOCTORS NOT REJOICING AT OCTUPLETS' RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doctors keep promising that it won't happen again. Ethicists
keep insisting that it shouldn't happen ever. But women taking
fertility drugs keep setting new records for multiple births to the
point where, after this week's announcement of octuplets born to a
Houston couple, many are asking if there's any upper limit.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, it seems, is that there isn't _ or if there is, no
one is sure what the number is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any absolute limit, or number, or
anything like that,'' said Dr. Ivan Frantz, chief of newborn
medicine at New England Medical Center's Floating Hospital for
Children in Boston. ``None of us is hoping it goes any further than
eight, but anything is possible theoretically.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laird Jackson, a specialist in prenatal genetics at
Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, also is in awe of
medicine's ability to break barriers it seemed would stand forever.
``It is likely,'' he said, ``that these eight children will be
superseded. . . . It probably won't happen next year, but the
technology may improve to keep babies alive and maybe more will
survive at some point.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Dr. Robert Barbieri, chief of obstetrics and gynecology
at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, suggested the Houston
octuplets are the endpoint of what he sees as a disturbing trend:
``If we could fast-forward 10 years this will be seen as an
historical oddity. . . . This will be the world record and
hopefully it won't be broken.''
</P>
<P>
   For many reasons, doctors and others worry about so many babies
born at the same time to the same parents. When so many fetuses
compete for nourishment, they will be born prematurely, and each
additional fetus makes an even earlier delivery likely. The earlier
the birth, the less likely any baby will survive and thrive. And
with even the ablest parents having trouble handling twins or
triplets, imagine the difficulties with eight babies at once.
</P>
<P>
   Octuplets are ``a disaster,'' said George Annas, professor of
health law at Boston University's School of Public Health. ``No
physician in their right mind would plan to have eight fetuses in
one woman. It's a prescription for almost definite premature birth
and a medical disaster in the intensive care unit, if not in later
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Most doctors agree, which is why those involved in fertility
work are working so hard to prevent such multiple births.
</P>
<P>
   At Massachusetts General Hospital, the in-vitro fertilization
program has succeeded in the last year in reducing the average
number of embryos transferred from 2.5 to 2, which has meant fewer
twins and triplets. That was made possible by advances in medical
therapies as well as in laboratory techniques for supporting embryo
development, said Dr. Thomas Toth, director of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Comparable advances are happening with the administration of
fertility drugs like those taken by Nkem and Iyke Chukwu, parents
of the Houston octuplets. Such drugs increase the number of eggs a
woman has available during a reproductive cycle, which means a
man's sperm will have more chance to connect, fertilize the egg,
and produce a baby. After a woman takes the drugs, doctors can use
ultrasound to monitor her estrogen levels and, if the response in
the ovaries is high enough to run the risk of multiple births, the
cycle can be interrupted before sperm is even introduced, said
Barbieri.
</P>
<P>
   There's always the possibility of mistakes, even with careful
monitoring, Barbieri added, but medicine is getting better at
minimizing that possibility. If there is no intervention, however,
``theoretically you could stimulate the ovaries to produce over 20
eggs,'' said Dr. Seth Katz, assistant professor of reproductive
endocrinology at the University of California at San Diego.
``Whether it's possible for all those eggs to fertilize is
unclear.''
</P>
<P>
   When multiple pregnancies are detected, the issue arises whether
to let them proceed or, early on, end some of them to give the
others a greater chance of proceeding normally. Such eventualities,
Annas said, should be worked out by the patient and doctor as a
precondition of using the new fertility technologies.
</P>
<P>
   What happens when seven babies are born, as they were last year
in Iowa to Bobbi and Kenny McCaughey? Or with the eight born to the
Chukwus, one of whom came 13 weeks early, or after just 27 weeks of
gestation, while the other seven were 11 weeks premature, or 29
weeks into the birth cycle?
</P>
<P>
   The rule of thumb, said Barbieri, is that babies born after 32
weeks almost all do well, while with those born after 28 weeks,
most do well. Between 24 and 28 weeks there's a good chance of
surviving but also a good chance of serious disabilities, he said,
while under 24 weeks there's a ``very, very low rate'' of survival.
</P>
<P>
   But Frantz pointed out that over time, doctors have gotten
better at ensuring that multiple birth babies can remain in the
womb longer. And when they're born, ``we can take better care of
them.''

   People do love their luxury. The Brown Palace Hotel in Denver
recently tracked the purchase of luxury items and services by its
guests, and here's what it found:
</P>
<P>
   --At Churchill, the hotel's cigar bar and restaurant, 23
customers last year spent up to $295 for a pre-Castro 1954 Dunhill
cigar.
</P>
<P>
   --Sales of Dom Perignon champagne, at $195 per bottle, increased
4 percent. Eighteen guests shelled out $300 for a bottle of
Roederer's Cristal Rose champagne, but only three went for Opus
One, at $260 a bottle. Sales of Johnny Walker Blue Label at $35 per
glass were up 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --Sales in the on-site flower shop increased 8.6 percent between
1996 and 1997. In the same time span, guest laundry revenue rose
4.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --And this year, one guest indulged her spouse with the hotel's
Ultimate Experience Package. The cost: a mere $4,500.

AN INSPIRING _ AND SAFE _ TRIP TO THE HOLY CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM, West Bank _ ``O little town of Bethlehem, How still
we see thee lie!''
</P>
<P>
   As we entered Bethlehem a few weeks ago, I couldn't help but
hear those words over and over in my mind. In between, though, I
couldn't help but think that this is no ``little town,'' nor did
the words ``How still we see thee lie!'' ring true on that November
day.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, the first of thousands of Christian pilgrims
will find their way to this town about six miles from the old city
of Jerusalem. Since the date of celebrating Jesus'birth differs
among Christians, Christmas will again be celebrated in Bethlehem
on Jan. 7 by the Greek Orthodox and on Jan. 19 by Armenians.
</P>
<P>
   While the real reason for celebrating Christmas in America seems
to be becoming lost amid the hustle of gift-giving and crowded
shopping malls filled with Santas and their elves, for Christians,
a return to Bethlehem is both good for the soul and a jarring
reminder that in the 2,000 years since Christ's birth, the good
will to mankind has yet to be achieved.
</P>
<P>
   The Bethlehem my wife and I saw along with Rich and Linda,
friends from Seattle, was a far cry from that which inspired
Phillips Brooks to write his memorable carol. Brooks, the famed
rector of Boston's historic Trinity Church, visited Bethlehem in
1866 and wrote the carol during the winter of 1868 while he was
still living in Philadelphia just before coming to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Just as millions wonder how the latest peace agreement of today
between Israelis and Palestinians will work, it is a reminder that
the ``peace'' promised at Jesus' birth has yet to be seen in
Bethlehem and Israel. For Mary and Joseph, their journey from
Nazareth to Bethlehem was mandatory because Caesar Augustus issued
a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world.
Joseph, being of the house of David (David was born here, and the
city is called ``the city of David''), had to return to his
birthplace. And, finding no place in the inn, Mary gave birth to
Jesus in a simple manger.
</P>
<P>
   And so, on a star-filled night, shepherds and others found their
way to that manger.
</P>
<P>
   On an early November Sunday morning, we began a short journey
that ``covered'' Jesus' lifetime. Our driver picked us up after a
simple church service at the Garden Tomb (one of two places said to
be where Jesus was placed after his crucifixion) just beyond the
old city of Jerusalem. Within 15 minutes or so, we arrived in
Bethlehem. Jerusalem's present sprawl is such that if it were not
for a roadblock with jersey??? barriers marking the border of
Bethlehem with Jerusalem, we might not have realized how short a
journey it is between the two biblical places.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Israel handed over Bethlehem to Palestinian control in
accordance with the Oslo II agreement. Today, the city of about
25,000 consists of about two-thirds Muslims, and the remainder
Christian Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Our driver, a Palestinian, points at a lineup of yellow Mercedes
taxis on the Bethlehem side of the border, saying, ``Look at all
those taxis with no customers.'' Economics is a major problem in
negotiations for peace. Our driver, who has lived in Jerusalem all
his life, has a permit to travel throughout Israel, but for the
Palestinians living in Bethlehem to get a permit to visit even
Jerusalem, where hospitals are located, can take weeks. Does that
mean some die, we ask? ``Yes,'' he said, and that is why those
taxis are empty, because the drivers must rely??? on visitors
crossing by foot into Bethlehem. Most arrive by motorcoach.
</P>
<P>
   For Christians arriving in Bethlehem this year, the scene is a
bit chaotic, not because of violence but because of construction.
Manger Square, in front of the fourth-century church built over
what is believed to be the traditional birthplace of Jesus, is one
big construction site as the city prepares both for the Christmas
celebrations and the year 2000. The construction was reportedly to
be finished by Dec. 25, but from our view, less than two months
ago, I doubt it.
</P>
<P>
   The Church of the Nativity is a magnificent church built over
the site where Jesus was born. The site was determined in 324 by
Helena , mother of Emperor Constantine, who sent her to find the
sites associated with the life of Jesus. After being shown the cave
where it was said the birth took place, she ordered a church built
upon the site. In the sixth century, Emperor Justinian replaced it
with the larger structure that now stands. Over the years, the Holy
Lands have been invaded and many sites destroyed, but this church
has essentially remained undisturbed. Some alterations were made
after the church was captured by Crusaders in 1099 (on Christmas
1100, Crusader King Baldwin I was crowned in the church). In the
11th century, the church was spared by Muslims because Jesus is
named in the Koran as one of the Holy Prophets.
</P>
<P>
   We park in the church's courtyard because there is no other
place to stop with all the construction. While our driver argues
with local police over the space, a postcard seller catches my
attention by offering 50 camels for my wife. It's a good offer, but
I decline. I do show faith by buying some cards that I otherwise
would have refused.
</P>
<P>
   Humility is called for to enter the church, which appears more
like a Crusader fortress from the outside. All must bow to enter
through the small doorway, deliberately constructed that way to
prevent Muslims of another era from entering on horseback.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, we see a plain but huge open area with double rows of
limestone pillars supporting an oak ceiling. Our guide pulls open a
wooden cover to reveal the original floor from the days of Helena.
He then leads us past the great Greek Orthodox altar where we can
see a long line of people waiting. ``Quickly, I will show you my
secret entrance to the manger,'' the guide says. It is actually the
exit to the grotto, and he surprises another guide lecturing to
visitors there.
</P>
<P>
   The Grotto of the Nativity is small and lined with marble walls.
At the Altar of the Nativity, a large silver star in the floor
marks the reported site of where Mary gave birth. A few feet away,
we go three steps into the Chapel of the Manger, which is where
Mary is said to have placed Jesus. There are other altars and
chapels here as well as the tomb of St. Jerome. The entire church
site is controlled by the Greek Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
   Adjacent to the Church of the Nativity is a Roman Catholic
church, where Christmas Eve services will be held this Dec. 24.
Many groups who visit the grotto are said to break into hymns or
carols at seeing the site of Jesus' birth. It is an act of faith
for many, considering that the site was not determined for more
than 300 years after Jesus' birth, and the placing of the star
marking the site was not chosen until the 17th century.
</P>
<P>
   While we do not hear any song in the grotto, we do hear the
music and chants of a Mass at an altar above the grotto as we
leave. The priests conduct their service undisturbed by passing
groups of tourists, many of whom are taking flash pictures of the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   We do witness the sudden burst of carol singing when we visit
Shepherds' Field's grottoes and chapel. Here is where the angels
sang ``Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among all
people.'' Within the chapel, a pilgrimage group from England
seemingly without a cue from anyone bursts into singing the First
Noel carol we know so well.
</P>
<P>
   The chapel is beautifully decorated with scenes from the Bible.
An adjacent grotto is believed to be the place ``where shepherds
watched their flocks by night.'' Outside, we view terraced olive
grove fields where the sheep were tended, and while we can hear the
sheep in the distance, only kittens are seen playing about in front
of the chapel. I speak to one, but it obviously doesn't understand
English.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, a Lutheran pastor, schedules a visit to the Christmas
Church, a Lutheran church in Bethlehem that has opened its doors to
the International Center, which offers an Alternative Tourism
Program designed to give a fuller understanding of the history,
culture, society, and people of the Holy Land. Many interactive
programs are offered for interaction between Christians, Jews,
Muslims, and Palestinians. Linda, also a minister who is planning a
future church pilgrimage, is interested in the center's women's
programs for her group.
</P>
<P>
   Since tourism is a major economic factor in Bethlehem's life,
the center also teaches Palestinians to be guides for visitors.
Israel boasts some 2,000 licensed guides, who, based on our
experiences, are well informed on everything in the Holy Land from
archeology to religion. However, fewer than 40 of these guides are
Palestinians. The center's goal is to produce knowledgeable
Palestinian guides who could offer another perspective to a
visitor's experience.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the sites associated with Jesus' birth, Bethlehem also
has other biblical places. King David was born here; there is the
Chapel of the Milk, where it is believed Mary spilled some milk
while feeding Jesus; the Field of Boaz, where Ruth gathered
gleanings left by her future husband; and Rachel's Tomb, where Jews
pray before a large tomb shrouded in cloth where the second wife of
Jacob is believed to be buried.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout our journey in Israel and into Jordan, safety never
seems an issue, except for a brief visit to Rachel's Tomb. Our
driver suggests a visit before we leave Bethlehem. We are greeted
by the site of Jersey barriers around the entrance to the tomb and
armed soldiers at either end. Across the way, I see soldiers atop
nearby roofs, and others slightly hidden behind canvas on open
stairways. It is a holy day for Jews, and the tomb area is crowded
with Hasidic Jews in their black attire. Rich and I have only a
slight problem entering (women are not allowed) because we have no
head covering, and one man simply points to our heads. We get the
message and find some paper yarmulkes provided for the situation
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Our final stop is at a gift shop, where my wife purchases
Nativity scenes, not those depicting a cave but the more
traditional ones carved from olive wood.
</P>
<P>
   While many can question the validity of the biblical sites of
Bethlehem, it is still an inspiring _ and safe _ place to visit.

HANGING OUT WITH MURRAY THE WRENCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGBOAT KEY, Fla. _ Watching two pelicans battling for a fish a
few yards from his sandy hangout on the Gulf of Mexico, Murray the
Wrench, the Buffalo orthodontist, yells, ``Be generous, guys! It's
the `better-to-give-than-to-gulp-selfishly season' again. Right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Darwin didn't see it that way, Murray, honey,'' says his
roomie, Susie the Wench, sunning beside him on the bleached
littoral of the Colony Beach Resort. However, to the grandchildren
circling them, she says, ``But Grumpa is right, kids. Kindness and
generosity is the seasonal theme, absolutely. But, remember, it
should be a 12-month proposition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I could straighten those hungry birds out,'' Murray says.
</P>
<P>
   Mini-Max wonders, ``But, Grumpa, do pelicans have teeth? Maybe
you could help alligators.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Better behaved and friendlier than most of my juvenile
patients, I'll bet.'' He seems absorbed, binocularing a nearby
wedding ceremony, a Michigan-Massachusetts merger of Amy Decker and
his longtime pal, Rob Lacy. ``I would have attended, but the
invitation said black tie and bare feet, and my pedicurist, Anna
Molnar, is out of town.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Jessica is really impatient. ``Come on, Grumps, our
Christmas story . . . now!'' Her cousins chorus, ``Yeah, the
story.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always this way. Murray, known for years as the
Longboat Lothario, used to tell beach stories to ladies that made
diamond-encrusted sugar plums dance in their heads _ and then do
penance by fleeing to Buffalo. We would caucus at the Colony to
play tennis, swim, grab a grappa or two from the bartenders Tommaso
Tahmosh, Roberto Salvato, Kelly Green, eat the Capri-esque salad
and pasta that maitre d'hotel Alberto Mastromano, champ of the
chafing dish, conjures at our table _ generally regirding for the
lurking next year.
</P>
<P>
   But time mooches on and grandchildren march in. ``OK, kids, the
story.'' And he begins:
</P>
<P>
   ``A long, long time ago and a long way away, in what's now
Israel, the hot destination resort is a town called Bethlehem. A
very `in' place, you know. The rent-a-camel agencies run out of
beasts, and some people even walk there. The hotels are more
overloaded than Judge Starr's expense account.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is partying, and the celebrated five-star rock
group, Ebenezer and the Humbugs, is in town for a concert. But a
far bigger star suddenly appears in the sky, lighting up the
universe, and seeming headed for Bethlehem, too. Bigger and shinier
than the moon. It's a fate-changing attraction to a trio of
overweight talent agents with an office in the Orient. They are the
Three Wide Men _ Fats, Fatso, and Fatback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starstruck, excited, they mount their camels as Fats cries,
`Follow that light! It must mean something really big. Maybe bigger
than golden calfburgers.' `Bigger than a fire sale at Burning
Bush?' asks Fatso. `Bigger than the Dead Sea recovering?' queries
Fatback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fats says he thinks so, and they spur the camels over moor and
mountain, field and fountain to the outskirts of Bethlehem. There,
shepherds are quaking, and fearful sheep are counting them, trying
to go to sleep and forget this very strange night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abruptly the great star pauses and hovers above a nondescript
neighborhood. The Three Wide Men dismount and stand in the glow
that illuminates a barn. A boy who says his name is Tinsel Tim
tells them that inside are a humble carpenter and his pregnant
wife. Her time has come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entering, they see the woman called Mary serenely nursing her
newborn son while the father, Joseph, mutters happily, as
carpenters will, about a `chip off the old 2-by-4.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Fats whispers to his partners, `Guys, we should come up with
something for the kid. A birthday gift.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Rustling around in a saddlebag, Fatso finds some coins and
snack food. Gold, frankfurters, and Miracle Whip. The first
Christmas presents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fatback says, `It ain't much, but . . ..'
</P>
<P>
   `` `It's the thought that counts,' Joseph says, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fatback says, `Yeah. Maybe you can exchange them when the
stores open.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside the barn there's music in the air. Tinsel Tim says,
`Hey, it's Ebenezer and the Humbugs _ but these aren't his usual
acerbic lyrics. No . . . listen. . . .'
</P>
<P>
   `` `Joy to the world. . . .' sweeps through the rickety
building. Then in come the musicians with Ebenezer wearing the only
smile anyone has ever seen on his face. Clanging alongside him is
his pal and customary warm-up act, Jacob Marley, a fugitive from a
Baghdad chain gang. Garlanded in manacles, shackles, and irons,
shake-rattling-and-rolling, Marley has made his name with a novelty
hit called `Jingle Chains.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But now he's harmonizing with the Humbugs as they sing, `O,
Little Town of Bethlehem.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The Three Wide Men clap and yell, `Terrific! What's come over
that grouchy tightwad, Ebenezer?'
</P>
<P>
   `` `Well, the Spirit of Christmas, that's what,' says Marley. `I
appeared to him in a dream, warning him to beware of Christmas
Future. Mend your ways or end your days, Ebenezer, I told him.'
</P>
<P>
   `` `What's Christmas?' says Tinsel Tim, looking puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   `` `This. Right here _ the original, the birth of the Christ
child. The message of helping your neighbors and those less
fortunate, opening your hearts to strangers. . . .'
</P>
<P>
   ``Tinsel Tim wants to know, `How long can this last?'
</P>
<P>
   `` `Maybe a couple thousand years or longer,' Marley says.
Evergreen. Like, the trees that will joyfully accompany it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tinsel Tim looks at the young father and pleads, `Say it's so,
Joe.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Joseph nods his head positively, and Tim declares, `God bless
us every one. In this barn is what everyone needs _ a stable
family.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wide Men chime in, `This could be the beginning of a
beautiful idea.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And, kids,'' says Murray the Wrench, ``it is. A fine way to
end one year and start another _ extending a helping hand. Treating
others like you want to be treated.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;

</P>
<P>
   You took the words right off my disk, Murray. And so to you,
treasured reader, my journeying friend, Aurelio, and I wish Holiday
Hurrahs! Plus traveling without unraveling, and the milk of human
kindness whipped into a delicious frappe for you and yours.

HOLIDAY TIPS: UNCERTAINTY OF THE SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SALLY JACOBS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Be honest.
</P>
<P>
   There is at this moment a question plaguing the populace more
vital than the impeachment of the president, the stalled Middle
East negotiations, and the birth of Jesus Christ combined. It is,
of course, whether to give a holiday tip.
</P>
<P>
   In a world of uncertain moral standards, it is a question for
which there is no clear answer. Some people do it because they
think it's the right thing to do. Some do it because they fear if
they do not, the mail, the maid, and the milk will disappear and
the garbage will not. Some do not do it because they regard holiday
tipping, as in that little self-addressed envelope tucked
suggestively in your newspaper, as a mild form of extortion.
</P>
<P>
   What, one wonders, do the manners mavens have to say?
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are people you see regularly or who do things for you
regularly, you should tip them,'' said Karen Grigsby Bates,
co-author of the book, ``Basic Black: Home Training for Modern
Times,'' and a columnist for the Los Angeles Times. ``You know,
these people are not earning a king's ransom, and if you can afford
it, it's a nice thing to say thanks for taking care of me all year
long.''
</P>
<P>
   But what if, like many people, you never see your garbage
collector, or wouldn't recognize your mail carrier in a police
lineup? In gentler, less harried times, people were on a first-name
basis with such folks, and holiday tipping was relatively
commonplace. But at a time when frenetic schedules barely afford
people time to bond with their families, much less their garbage
collector and mail carrier, seasonal tips are, if not a fading
tradition, a profoundly puzzling one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not give holiday tips. We are bad people,'' sighed Tony
Cotrupi, 36, as he piled an armful of Christmas gifts into his car
on Boston's tony Newbury Street. ``I do not know my garbage man or
my mailman. I have no relationship with them. So why would I give
them extra money when they are already paid?''
</P>
<P>
   Cotrupi, an account director for a Boston advertising agency,
thought again. ``OK. The reality is they're doing a thankless job
and it would probably help them out. So now I probably will give.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, many people still do tip a host of people
including their hairdressers and their cab drivers, their doormen
and their baby sitters, their favorite food server and their milk
deliverer. Tom Hileman, a customer service representative of the
Crescent Ridge Dairy in Sharon, Mass., said that about two-thirds
of the 19 delivery people get some form of seasonal tip, although
he is not sure how much. And what happens if they do not get one?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure being human they might get peeved, especially if they
thought they were doing more than required,' said Hileman. ``I've
heard nothing to that effect, but people being people, it wouldn't
surprise me.''
</P>
<P>
   Claire Cassella, 50, tips several people who work for her, just
like her parents did because, ``that's the way I was brought up.''
She gives $20 to her hairdresser, $100 to the lawn man, and $50 to
the newspaper carrier. She does not give to the mail carrier, she
says, because she doesn't know him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, you know, if I got a little note in my mailbox saying,
`Hello, I am your mailman,' I'd probably give,'' said Cassella.
``You know, I am the sucker. A total pushover.''
</P>
<P>
   What, then, is the middle ground between saint and sucker?
What's the right amount to give and to whom? Generally, people seem
to give between $10 and $20 to the newspaper carrier and the
garbage collector. Mail carriers are prohibited from receiving cash
but can accept gifts valued at $20 and under, according to postal
authorities. Household staff, like baby sitters, gardeners,
housekeepers, and the like, are often given a week's pay or a
substantial gift.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ``Basic Black'' suggests holiday tips for several
other categories of service. For the dry cleaner, candy or
something to share. For the doorman, $25 to $50. For the kennel
operator, food or an item that can be shared. And for the maitre d'
at your favorite restaurant, $50.
</P>
<P>
   But are gifts better than cash? Bates's rule of thumb is, ``if
it's someone I know well enough to know their preferences, I try to
give what I know they'd like instead of cash,'' she said. ``People
like presents because they're personal. But cash is good and some
young people would rather have the money, thank you very much.
People do not often turn it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who provide services generally say either one will do just
fine. Arline Murray, a hair stylist at the Richard Joseph Salon on
Newbury Street, gets a $10 tip from many of her regular clients, or
about $200, around the holidays, but she also gets presents. So far
this year she's gotten a candle, body lotion, chocolates, and some
homemade Christmas ornaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I like the gifts best because when I look at them I
think of the client,'' said Murray, a hairstylist for 22 years.
``They're things I probably wouldn't get for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Gilchrist, 46, a mail carrier, is a cash man himself,
the rules notwithstanding. About 20 percent of his 450 customers
give him $20 each around the holidays, although last year he got a
whopping $600 altogether. This year he has a new route that
includes tony Brattle Street, and he's hoping he might top last
year's tally. So far, he's only gotten $80 but he's still hopeful.
``It's still early,'' said Gilchrist. ``Next week is the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Gilchrist, the father of two, is thankful for what
he gets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tips help my kids have a better Christmas,'' said
Gilchrist, turning back to his route. ``And that's what it's all
about, right?''

THE HAS-BEEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember the ``Crash of 98?'' Neither did I _ so much else has
happened recently. So I went back to see what the business
magazines had to say after the Dow Jones industrial average dropped
512 points on Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, I was interested in the circumstances in which
hedge fund proprieter George Soros closed up his new pronunciamento
``The Crisis of Global Capitalism.'' As he says in the preface, it
is ``an instant book'' prepared in the aftermath of the collapse of
the Russian ruble. Fortune's ``Crash of 98'' cover in September led
off with Joe Nocera's ``Requiem for the Bull.'' (``One it looked as
if the miracle market could go on forever.'')
</P>
<P>
   Forbes posed the question _ 1929? or 1987? _ but didn't dare to
make a call, leaving it to ten columnists to go their separate
ways. (Applied economist Steve H. Hanke wrote, ``Russia doesn't
much matter? It may be a small economy, but so was Austria when, in
the 1930s, its Creditanstalt failed, taking down much of Europe's
banking system . . . '' Business Week, as usual, trumpeted on its
cover ``Time to act!''
</P>
<P>
   None reckoned on what has happened since. It took nearly two
years after 1987 for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 to regain its
previous peak; this time it required just four months _ the
shortest recovery of any major correction according to David Wyss
of Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI in Lexington.
</P>
<P>
   Soros, too, clearly was counting on a stormier mood than today
exists when he told a congressional committee on Sept. 15: ``The
global capitalist system which has been responsible for the
remarkable prosperity of this country in the last decade is coming
apart at the seams.'' (The testimony is quoted for six pages in the
book.)
</P>
<P>
   Soros, 68, is an extraordinarily successful speculator in
foreign currencies. His personal worth is said to be about $5
billion. He has made many billions more for investors in his
Quantum fund, one of the world's largest hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
   But Soros hasn't actively managed Quantum since 1989. Instead,
he entrusts the task to a battery of talented subordinates. During
a book tour interview with Clay Harris and Norma Cohen of the
Financial Times, Soros put it this way: ``I think that I've lost
it. I'm like an overaged ballet dancer. I just haven't got what it
takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in anticipation of this moment, Soros for years has been
positioning himself as an elder statesman of finance. But if he's a
money management has-been, he's a never-was as an analyst of
economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier book, ``The Alchemy of Finance,'' postulated a
universal principle of ``reflexivity:'' namely, that received
opinions have a way of turning back on themselves, as mavericks
outguess the herd.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Soros letter to the Financial Times in August that was
widely viewed as having been a contributing factor to the Russian
crisis, which boiled over when the government defaulted on some of
its bonds. His new book offers a blow-by-blow account. He was at
the time Russia's single biggest investor _ a role which was not
widely understood as he offered his advice.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Crisis of Global Capitalism,'' Soros proposes an
international credit insurance company, to guarantee the debts of
emerging nations to investors like him. ``He's like Robert
McNamara, after he had screwed up Vietnam,'' says Peter Brooke, the
international venture capitalist based in Boston. ``First you get
this grandiose technological offensive. When that doesn't work you
get this great mea culpa.''
</P>
<P>
   Happily, one thing at which Soros is indisputably good is giving
his money away. A network of foundations in Eastern Europe are
noted for their modest but quick and highly effective bequests _
such as the underground elctrical power plant that kept the city of
Sarajevo running during its siege.
</P>
<P>
   You can chart Soros' reputation as a guru, however, on the media
bourse. His first book was excerpted in the Financial Times. This
time it was Newsweek. Next? Maybe the Drudge Report.

HIS FORTUNES DECLINE _ BY AN ASTONISHING $546M 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How does it feel to lose a half-billion dollars in five months?
</P>
<P>
   Most of us will never know, but Alan Trefler has found out.
</P>
<P>
   Trefler, the founder and president of Pegasystems Inc., has seen
the value of his personal holding of the Cambridge, Mass. software
company collapse by an astonishing $546 million since July. As
recently as September, a ranking by Forbes ASAP magazine listed
Trefler as Massachusetts's richest technology tycoon, and he and
his wife were continuing to add to the millions they had already
generously doled out to the Boston public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Today Trefler's stock is still worth just under $100 million _
certainly not chump change _ but this onetime chess champion must
know that another false move will spell the endgame for the company
he launched 15 years ago with a loan from his mom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a frustrating and disappointing time,'' Trefler
said Monday. ``I don't know what else to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustrating all the more because Pegasystems' wounds are all
self-inflicted. Widely admired for its technology, Pegasystems has
tripped not once but twice in a year over accounting issues, not
the competition. Wall Street, hardly a forgiving place, gave
Pegasystems a second chance a year ago. It has been different this
time: The stock has fallen from a high of 30 in July to 4 7/16
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Trefler were wearing his board member hat, he would be out
of there,'' says one Wall Street analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Pegasystems develops software that helps automate customer
inquiries at banks, credit card companies, and even the Federal
Reserve. Its big customers include the likes of Citibank, Chase,
and Sears, Roebuck. Revenues have been exploding.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has been bedeviled by the issue of when a sale
is actually a sale _ or revenue recognition, as it is known in the
business. It is an issue that has long been a hot potato in the
software industry, where fast growth and an eagerness to please
Wall Street has often gotten young companies in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen months ago Pegasystems got into a highly unusual public
dispute with its auditors, Ernst &AMP; Young, who wanted the company to
restate its quarterly earnings. Pegasystems objected, Ernst
resigned the account, and the company did eventually restate its
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company is again wrestling with the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Pegasystems' shares fell 35 percent when it
announced disappointing third-quarter earnings because some
customers had delayed orders. A month later, it said it was
delaying finalizing its quarterly report because it was ``reviewing
certain revenue transactions'' with its outside auditors.
Adjustments to the results ``are likely,'' the company said.
Shareholder suits followed, just as they had a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, after the market closed, Pegasystems warned that
revenues for the fourth quarter will likely be ``significantly
below'' analysts' expectations of $33 million to $35 million for
the fourth quarter. The company cited uncertainty caused by the
company's delayed third-quarter report and a slowdown in spending
by its customers. The company offered nothing new on the review of
the previous quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Customers are nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Pegasystems dismisses a link between the two accounting
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a connection, other than they both happened to
us,'' Trefler says.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, however, two strikes are a lot.
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock Mutual Funds, for instance, bought a half-million
shares during the third quarter, increasing holdings to 636,900 by
Sept. 30. It has since dumped the stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have done themselves some serious damage,'' Rob Schwartz,
an analyst for SG Cowen &AMP; Co., said Monday before Pegasystems made
its fourth-quarter announcement. Schwartz says the accounting
issues have obscured the company's underlying technology strength
and given short-sellers _ those who bet the stock will fall _ an
opening big enough to drive a truck through.
</P>
<P>
   Added analyst Robert Austrian of NationsBanc Montgomery
Securities: ``Institutional investors can't know how they're doing
without numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest snafu was uncovered by Pegasystems' new chief
financial officer, Richard Goldman. He is a man who has been here
before.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Goldman arrived as CFO at Sequoia Systems, a
Marlborough software company, just as the company was beginning to
wade through a swamp of revenue-recognition issues that eventually
cost the chief executive and others their jobs. In mid-1997,
Goldman signed on at PictureTel Corp., an Andover maker of
videoconferencing systems, and almost immediately found another
revenue-recognition mess, which sparked another top management
shake-up.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies survived their problems, and Goldman thinks
Pegasystems can, too _ even with two strikes against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be damn sure there is not going to be a third one _ not
while I am here,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   No company needs this. Pegasystems already faces stiff
competitors like Vantive Corp., Siebel Systems, and Clarify Inc.
Giants SAP AG and Oracle Corp. are moving in, too. While the other
companies talk product to their customers, Pegasystems must explain
its accounting problems.
</P>
<P>
   No one has more at stake here than Trefler. He was one of those
rare entrepreneurs who said no when the venture capitalists came
calling with their millions, and he still holds 75 percent of the
stock.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago his stock was worth $643 million. Depending on
how the story ends, Trefler could go down in the books as one of
the great personal flameouts in Massachusetts technology history _
or as one of the great comebacks.

THE GHOST OF FOXBORO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ In American fiction the eyes of Doctor T.J.
Eckleburg stare across the ``vally of ashes'' connecting West Egg
and New York City, haunting Jay Gatsby, Daisy Buchanan, and Nick
Carraway.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston's Kenmore Square the Citgo sign hovers above the city
skyline, a neon god blinking ceaselessly as the Red Sox lose
another ballplayer, another game, another season.
</P>
<P>
   And in godforsaken Foxborough, the Ghost of the Great White Tuna
spooks and stalks all those who work inside the moribund football
stadium alongside Route 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to beat the Jets,'' Patriots linebacker Chris Slade
said Monday. ``That's the only way for the Ghost of Bill to be
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots play the Jets Sunday at the Meadowlands, and at
stake is a home first-round playoff game for New England. The Jets
already have won the AFC East and earned a first-round bye in the
NFL's Super Bowl Tournament, but coach Bill Parcells is not likely
to help the Future Hartfords. Tuna's disdain for New England owner
Bob Kraft runs deep, and Parcells no doubt enjoys making life
difficult for the egomaniacal owner who put out the spin that
Parcells couldn't be trusted to pick players.
</P>
<P>
   Since Kraft decided that he wanted to be the star of his own
team, the post-Super Bowl Patriots are 19-12 over two seasons. The
Jets, a 1-15 team when New England went to the Super Bowl, are
20-11 since Parcells went to New Jersey in exchange for all those
yummy (hello, Sedrick Shaw) draft picks. Kraft, who cites his
``commitment to winning'' as he stuffs his pockets with Connecticut
cash and moves the team to suburban New York, apparently could not
make the commitment to live with the greatest NFL coach since Vince
Lombardi.
</P>
<P>
   And now Patriots-Jets games have become holy wars, pitting
brother against brother, New Yorker against New Englander, and Tuna
against Kraft. New England's owner has enlisted an army of notepad-
and microphone-wielding suckups, but he can't turn the AFC East
standings upside down and (even though the Patriots clearly have
better players) beating the Jets has been almost impossible since
Parcells drove his Cadillac out of town. If not for John Hall's
errant chip-shot field goal in 1997, the Jets would be 3-0 against
the Patriots in the post-Tuna era.
</P>
<P>
   And that is why Sunday's joust means more than home-field
advantage in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Carroll earned a big win against his hometown San Francisco
49ers Sunday, but he won't be secure until he can beat Parcells
with some regularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tremendous coach,'' Carroll said. ``He's a factor. The
coach can be a factor. Until you beat him, I think it's there and
you have a chance to write about it. It's a good little story.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll is good at taking the high road, but his true feelings
slipped in October when he thought he was talking off the record to
a New Jersey reporter and said that everything Parcells says is a
``crock.'' That's not something Carroll wanted in the paper, but
it's a normal response given the unfair situation he faced as The
Man Who Replaced Tuna.
</P>
<P>
   It's been said that Parcells gets into the heads of his former
players. The first three post-Tuna Patriots-Jets games did nothing
to dispel the notion. When he was in New England, Tuna would tease
his players, saying, ``I can't wait until I get to coach against
you someday and exploit your weaknesses.'' This is precisely what
he has done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jets are division champs,'' said defensive back Lawyer
Milloy. ``They kinda took over our title, and we have a lot of
friends on that side of the ball. Bill's probably laughing at our
situation. I really want to whip his butt just because I respect
him so much. It's hard for anybody not to respect him because of
the things he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie McGinest, another former Parcells target, said, ``Bill
had a lot of tricks. He benched me and told me I stunk. He does a
lot of things to get guys going.''
</P>
<P>
   And now Parcells has his new/old guys atop the AFC East, with a
first-round bye, waiting for hungry New England to come to the
swamps of New Jersey. The Patriots need the game to get home field
for the first round. But more than that, they need the game for
their self-respect. They need to exorcise the Ghost of the Tuna.

AN IDEA WE ALL CAN BUY INTO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN LEVINGSTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Give me a big holiday pat on the back. Thank me with a hearty ho
ho ho for being a patriotic American. I don't mean that I stand up
for the constitution _ whatever that means _ in this impeachment
mess. I don't mean that I sashay about in Ben Franklin wigs. I mean
that I go out and spend spend spend _ not only during the holiday
season but happily all year long.
</P>
<P>
   Among the religious objects of this blessed season, I hold as
most holy my Macy's charge card. When I enter Bloomingdales I
genuflect. I honor the name of the Lord, that is, Lord &AMP; Taylor. A
one-day sale causes me to break out in hives. I jump into the car
and slam the accelerator to the floor _ watch out, baby, I'm on the
highway.
</P>
<P>
   I fulfill my life and all my expectations at the mall. I see
beauty, I enrich my soul, I achieve enlightenment. Instead of
reading a book, I go shopping. Instead of prowling the museum, I go
shopping. To hell with helping out at the homeless shelter, I'm
going shopping. I shop when I'm sad to make me happy. I shop when
I'm happy to make me happier.
</P>
<P>
   My income has been declining. But what the heck _ I'm still
spending more than ever. Nothing can stop me. I've got credit, and
I can get more credit. My own little mountain of debt is higher
than it's ever been. Oh, and by the way, I have no savings.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm not alone. Check out the statistics. In October, the
latest month statistics were available, we Americans spent 0.2
percent more than we earned. In other words, the personal savings
rate fell into negative territory _ for the first time since the
1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Am I worried? Are you kidding? I still consider myself rich.
</P>
<P>
   Look at my stock portfolio. We all know that the stock market is
there to keep us going, that is, to keep us spending. The stock
market will save us. It always has in the past 15 years. The stock
market is all the savings I need.
</P>
<P>
   Let me explain it to you. The way things are going makes perfect
sense. Everything's fine. I buy whatever I want _ I keep myself
happy.
</P>
<P>
   And by keeping myself happy, I drive the American economy.
Indeed, I have a patriotic duty to spend as much as I can as fast
as I can. If I didn't give my all to shopping, America would lose
respect and prestige in every corner of the globe. Let's be frank:
I am the reason America dominates the world. Yes, I am a genuine
American hero.
</P>
<P>
   If I get a little squeezed for money, I just sell a few shares.
Then all I have to do is wait a little while and my stocks go up
again, replacing whatever I creamed off the top _ and, I must point
out, often adding to it. And all the while, the American economy
continues to hum.
</P>
<P>
   Don't whisper to me about any stock market reversal. How can you
be so silly? We've all seen what happens when the market goes down
_ it just goes up again, higher than ever. And I get richer and
richer, and I go out and buy something I really need _ for example,
the sofa that ``Friends'' star Lisa Kudrow plunked down on when she
graced ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a steal, at $1500. It's purchases like this that
really keep the old economy humming.
</P>
<P>
   And so to all the worry warts, I say: Bah humbug! How does that
Christmas jingle go? Tis the season for greed and folly.
Fa-la-la-la-la.

GREAT DEBATE BY FOX COMMENTATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fox's often zany football commentators got serious for a moment
Sunday to talk about racism in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Collinsworth wasted little time in getting right to the
point about the punishment handed to Carolina Panther Kevin Greene,
who attacked an assistant coach during a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about a double standard here,'' Collinsworth
said. ``A perception that is out there among black players is that
a Fred Lane, who makes an obscene gesture during the course of a
game, gets a one-game suspension, and that Kevin Greene goes after
a coach, a la Latrell Sprewell, and he gets the same suspension.''
</P>
<P>
   Howie Long had another take. He argued that the key difference
between Sprewell and Greene was that Greene's attack happened
during ``the heat of the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the first time it's happened in football and
certianly will not be the last,'' Long said. ``God forbid if the
NFL allowed cameras at the practice field , then half of the league
would be suspended. I have a harder time explaining to my son why
Fred Lane did what he did than I do explaining what Kevin Greene
did. It has nothing to do with color.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Terry Bradshaw said Greene should have been punished
for more than one game.
</P>
<P>
   But leave it to host James Brown to have the final word.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are distinct differences between the Sprewell and Greene
situations, but the fundamental question is what is acceptable
behavior?'' Brown asked. ``Attacking your coach, no matter what
level it is, is absolutely unacceptable. The Panthers suspending
Greene and no league action taken at all is weak, to say the
least.''

</P>
<P>
   The rivalry between Fox and CBS, especially the networks'
pregame shows, had been relatively civil _ until Sunday. During
Fox's pregame show, Brown talked about Florida coach Steve
Spurrier. ``Despite public denials by Spurrier, we have learned
that he will listen to NFL head coaching offers at the end of the
season,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Later that afternoon, host Jim Nantz said during CBS's halftime
report that Spurrier called the station to deny the Fox report.
</P>
<P>
   Of course Spurrier is going to deny the report.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said as much, and CBS conceded as much later in the day.
During Bears-Ravens, CBS showed a graphic detailing possible
replacements for coaches Ted Marchibroda and Dave Wannstedt.
</P>
<P>
   One of names listed was Steve Spurrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just goes to show that not even their own people are watching

   Sunday, CBS sends Greg Gumbel, Phil Simms, and sideline reporter
Armen ``Our Man'' Keteyian to the Meadowlands for the 1 p.m.
Patriots-Jets game. Hype for Tuna Bowl 4 hasn't reached the
ridiculous level yet but it's still early. Fox has Giants-Eagles at
4, with Kenny Albert and Tim Green. Saturday Fox has Vikings-Oilers
at 12:30 p.m., with Dick Stockton and Matt Millen calling the
action. CBS has the game at 4 between the Chiefs and Raiders. Verne
Lundquist and Randy Cross will be in the booth . . . WILD's
``Coach'' Willie Maye went to the NBA charity game in Atlantic City
and came away with the pulse of the much-maligned locked-out
players. ``They genuinely want to come back,'' Maye said. ``Most of
them are still very optimistic that there will be a season. They
miss playing and the real basketball fans miss not having the
games. Union president Billy Hunter is not as optimistic, but told
me that he was willing to negotiate over the holidays to get a deal
done.''

A ROUGH FALL FROM GRACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cruzeiro Esporte Clube's following is among the greatest in
Brazil, derived from the Italian immigrants who formed the club in
1921, through modern-day successes of the 1976 and '97 Copa
Libertadores winners.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, though, fewer than 200 Cruzeiro fans were in Sao
Paulo's Estadio Morumbi for the second leg of the Brazilian
national championship. Nearly twice that many crowded into a
Southborough, Mass., restaurant for the satellite broadcast of
Cruzeiro's 1-1 tie with Corinthians.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Cruzeiro's support has indeed relocated from Minas
Gerais to New England in recent years, though enough remains for
100,000 to have filled the Governador Magalhaes Pinto for the first
leg of the final.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the presence of players such as Dirceu and Tostao,
Cruzeiro never has won the national championship. And the chances
are slim this year, since Corinthians requires only a tie in the
third leg in Sao Paulo Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The three-game format has not been an aesthetic success,
producing two draws, with the second game opening up only after
Marcelinho Carioca's goal in the 13th minute of the second half.
The series will have been a financial success, witnessed by more
than 200,000 spectators, as Morumbi is expected to be filled
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cruzeiro's hopes were virtually crushed before coach Levir Culpi
brought in two young substitutions, Caio and Marcelo Ramos, who
combined for the tying goal.
</P>
<P>
   But this championship seems destined for Corinthians, though
they were considered only No. 3 in Sao Paulo behind Pele's old
team, Santos, and Portuguesa.
</P>
<P>
   Wanderley Luxemburgo, who has observed Corinthians from the
stands while on suspension, has been juggling this job with
coaching the Brazilian national team, a demanding double.
</P>
<P>
   Luxemburgo has brought out the best in Carioca and Vampeta,
giving them their debuts in the Selecao. He has also collected
talents such as Colombia's Freddy Rincon, Paraguayan defender
Carlos Gamarra, plus ``Indio'' Jose Satirio do Nascimento, 19.
</P>
<P>
   Several Corinthians players likely will be moving on. Edilson, a
reserve, is valued at $6 million. Gamarra and midfielder Vampeta,
both priced at more than $3 million, have been claimed by Athletic
Bilbao in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Vampeta, 24, formerly of PSV Eindhoven, is likely the most
interesting Corinthians player. He recently earned $120,000 for
posing, clothed, for a gay magazine, causing former national team
coach Mario Zagallo to advise him to consult a psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   Pele has praised Vampeta as ``the best, most complete, player in
Brazil,'' which incensed Corinthians fans. They accused Pele of
possibly ``jinxing'' Vampeta, as he did by naming Colombia in the
1994 World Cup and Yugoslavia at France '98 as favorites.

   Fluminense savior?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another great Brazilian club, Fluminense, has fallen to the
third division and is on the brink of virtually disappearing from
the national scene. Only a combination of incredibly bad luck, plus
corruption and/or incompetence could have caused such a demise.
</P>
<P>
   Fluminense is calling on Carlos Alberto Parreira as savior.
Parreira, named coach last week, will have another former
MetroStars member, Branco, plus a strong support group of
assistants. Fluminense is where Parreira began his career as
trainer in the '60s. He then progressed to the national team in
1970 and won USA '94. Parreira has signed some lucrative contracts
since but has not achieved consistent results.

   Another once successful club, SS Napoli, is also sinking fast.
Napoli, champions of Italy in 1987 and '90 with Diego Maradona, was
relegated to Serie B this year.
</P>
<P>
   Napoli fans had been supportive until a 4-2 home loss to Ravenna
last week. The most militant ``supporters'' took their disgust to
ridiculous extents before the next game at Lecce. They ambushed the
Napoli team bus at a toll booth, smashing windows and sending an
iron bar through the windshield. The team then traveled in separate
cars and lost, 3-1, to Lecce to fall near to the relegation zone.
</P>
<P>
   There was similar disappointment in Napoli two years ago. Then,
several fans invaded the Soccavo training site and threatened the
players in what was a crude attempt at motivation. This time,
though, the attack was carried out by about 10 masked thugs whose
message was not as clear.
</P>
<P>
   Napoli had been on the verge of joining the power elite of
European soccer before the departure of Maradona, followed by the
inexplicable fire sale of other top players.
</P>
<P>
   The club still retains a level of sophistication. It has
attracted top sponsors and, wisely, taken out a Lloyd's of London
policy against being relegated again.

   Celtic owners quarrel
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Celtic ownership transition is becoming ugly. After Celtic
took a 5-0 win over Dunfermline, on two Henrik Larsson goals, the
takeover consortium headed by Simple Minds vocalist Jim Kerr
attacked the current ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr and former Celtic great Kenny Dalglish are attempting to
take over from Fergus McCann, who helped save the club with a huge
investment and by modernizing the operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about the great job Fergus has done,'' Kerr said.
``I think a standard job has been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerr said McCann has refused to meet with his consortium, which
is backed by BT Capital Trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``His attitude is encapsulated by his giving a footballing
great, a Celtic great, short shrift _ sheer disrespect,'' Kerr
said.

<P>
   Futbol at Foxboro
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution are anticipating becoming sole tenants of Foxboro
Stadium, according to general manager Brian O'Donovan. The area
could become an all-soccer complex, with practice fields and,
possibly, a small stadium for amateur teams.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1 million fans have attended soccer games at Foxboro
Stadium since the Revolution began operations in 1996. Revolution
regular-season total attendance is similar to the Patriots' in the
early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   This could be a banner attendance year at Foxboro. There will be
three Women's World Cup dates, the MLS Cup championship game, plus
possible exhibitions with European powers Ajax, Benfica, Inter, or
Napoli.
</P>
<P>
   In 16 MLS games, the Revolution drew 304,392, their lowest total
for regular-season games. The total was affected by the World Cup,
and does not count a 35,136 crowd for an exhibition against
Benfica.
</P>
<P>
   If the team could achieve on-field success similar to D.C.
United, it would provide an exceptional return for the Kraft
family's initial $5 million investment.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is to turn the Revolution into a winning, or at least
competent, team.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution are considering several trades, including one to
add MetroStars defender Rhett Harty. They will invite several
prospects to train in Italy from Feb. 10 to March 17, including
forward Ze Rodrigues, formerly of Sparta Rotterdam.

   A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; AMSTERDAM &QL; 
 &UR; Ian McEwan (Doubleday, $21)
</P>
<P>
   Restaurant critic Molly Lane had many lovers, and at least four
of them have come to mourn her passing. At the funeral gathering on
a frigid day in London, we meet Molly's possessive husband, George,
old friends Clive Linley and Vernon Halliday (one a highbrow
composer and the other a newspaper editor), and Julian Garmony, the
right-wing candidate for prime minister who made a life in
politics, McEwan writes, ``with an unexceptional stall of
xenophobic and punitive opinions.'' Molly is dead of a debilitating
disease, but she still manages to stir things up in a most
unexpected way: Not long after the funeral, George discovers among
her things three scandalous photographs of Julian, and he offers
them to Vernon, who is not above using sensational material to
boost the circulation of his failing newspaper. Meanwhile, Clive
suffers his own crisis of conscience when he does not come to the
aid of a woman being attacked by a serial rapist. McEwan tells his
brief story with clear-eyed, mordant humor and an unerring
knowledge of his wonderful characters. This novel was scheduled for
release in the United States next year, but was hurried into
publication when it won Britain's Booker Prize. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; LIFE PHOTOGRAPHERS: WHAT THEY SAW &QL; 
 &UR; John Loengard (Bulfinch, $35)
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Eisenstaedt was shooting photographs for a story on
Harvard University in 1961 when an editor called and said he had a
wonderful assignment for him. ``When is your story finished?'' the
editor asked. Maybe tomorrow or the day after, said Eisenstaedt,
wanting to stretch it out. The editor then told him that the new
assignment involved a trip to Rome to photograph Sophia Loren. ``I
am through in 15 minutes,'' Eisenstaedt said. He became friends
with Loren, who liked him, she confided to a ``Life'' reporter,
``because he reminds me very much of my obstetrician.'' Ernest
Hemingway was a different matter. ``He was the most difficult man I
have ever photographed,'' Eisenstaedt said. ``He used only
four-letter words, beginning to end.'' Here are Loengard's
interviews with 44 ````Lif''e'' photographers about the experience
of making some of the most enduring images of the past 60 years.
Included are Eisenstaedt, George Silk, Andreas Feininger, Cornell
Capa, Gordon Parks and Carl Mydans. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE GREATEST GENERATION &QL; 
 &UR; Tom Brokaw (Random House, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw has written a touching tribute to the men and women of
the World War II generation _ the men and women, he writes, ``who
have given us the lives we have today.'' His book is a series of
miniprofiles of people whose courage and sense of personal
responsibility survived great hardship: Thomas Broderick, who was
left blind after he was shot by a German sniper in Holland; Charles
Briscoe, whose experiences as the son of an itinerant farmer gave
him the work ethic and ingenuity he would need later when he worked
for Boeing and helped develop the B-29, the long-range bomber that
delivered the atomic bomb to Hiroshima; Margaret Ray Ringenberg,
one of the Women in the Air Force service pilots who handled
domestic flying duties so that men could fight overseas, then were
sent home to less-exciting lives when the war was over; Nao
Takasugi, whose Japanese-American family was forced to abandon its
prosperous market in California and move to an internment camp on
the Gila River Reservation; Jeanette Gagne Norton, whose young
husband was killed in action, leaving her with a 17-month-old son
who never had seen his father; and, under the heading ``Famous
People,'' the likes of George Bush, Ben Bradlee, Andy Rooney and
Julia Child. Brokaw says he wanted to write this book before the
men and women of this remarkable generation are gone. ``They have
so many stories to tell,'' he writes, ``stories that in many cases
they have never told before, because in a deep sense they didn't
think that what they were doing was that special, because everyone
else was doing it too.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; GATES OF EDEN &QL; 
 &UR; Ethan Coen (Morrow, $24)
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes _ it's (begin itals) that (end itals) Ethan Coen. The
first character we meet in this collection of stories is Joseph
Carmody, whose literate, reflective narration seems at odds with
the tale he tells. Carmody didn't like the future he saw when he
graduated from college, so he swerved, with a vengeance, and became
a fighter. His skill in the ring, however, is such that he doesn't
use the word ``fight,'' which, he points out, ``implies an (begin
itals) exchange (end itals) of blows.'' Instead, he calls them
``beatings'' and imagines billing himself as The Human Speedbag,
with business cards that say ``Joseph Carmody _ Blows Absorbed.''
Now, Carmody is approached by a low-life mobster, who asks him to
get pictures of his wife in a compromising position with a bitter
rival. Suddenly, the college boy is caught between dangerous men
who happily will slaughter him before he throws a punch. There are
14 stories here. Some are very good and some are not, but their
effect is recognizably similar to that of the movies (``Fargo,''
``Raising Arizona,'' ``Blood Simple'') Coen has made with his
brother, Joel _ funny and odd, with the threat of deep violence
always waiting to overwhelm everything else. &QL;

CALIFORNIA LAWMAKER REINTRODUCES HIV REPORTING BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY DELGADO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A member of the California Assembly has
reintroduced an HIV reporting bill that was vetoed by retiring Gov.
Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would require that any HIV infection be reported to
local health departments using specifications like a person's sex,
age and risk factor rather than a name.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, a Republican, vetoed the bill in September in part
because of the confidentiality clause. The sponsor, Assemblywoman
Carole Migden of San Francisco, said the legislation would have a
better change under the incoming governor, Democrat Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll work to accommodate concerns if (Davis) has them,'' said
Migden, a Democrat. ``We anticipate support. I would assume it will
be a smooth process but I don't want to pre-commit the governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis spokesman Michael Bustamante said the incoming
administration would not comment on pending legislation that hasn't
been reviewed but that Migden's bill would be thoroughly considered
if it is approved by the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would comply with recently announced guidelines from
the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that urged
states not only to report AIDS cases, but HIV cases as well.
California already has a reporting system for AIDS cases but not
HIV.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS is an affliction in which the human immunodeficiency virus,
or HIV, weakens the immune system, subjecting the body to serious
infection. AIDS is most often spread through sexual contact,
sharing contaminated needles and infected blood products.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is unknown how many people in California are
infected with HIV, nearly 37,000 people throughout the state are
known to have AIDS, second only to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Migden said a registry system would be important to provide
enhanced HIV treatment but that a person's privacy should be
protected. Instead, she said, that person would be given a special
number and be classified on the registry based on sex, race, age,
sexual orientation and risk factors for infection like needle use
or unprotected sex.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts and Texas
have either begun reporting cases by similar codes or are
developing such a system.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of a confidential system of reporting contend that it
would prevent health workers from notifying current or former
sexual partners that they may face the risk of infection. But
proponents of the system say that without confidentiality, some
HIV-infected people would be afraid to seek medical help.

SENSIBLE SIGNALS FROM THE SENATE 
</HEADLINE>

 By THOMAS OLIPHANT

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; -- As baton passes go, House-to-Senate on the
impeachment of President Clinton is one for the ages. It isn't
often, after all, that the fresh runner drops the baton on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   But that is what has happened.
</P>
<P>
   Already a bipartisan consensus has formed in the Senate around
an understandable proposition: that what happened in the House must
not be allowed to happen there.
</P>
<P>
   It is a proposition that shatters party lines and inclinations
about the president's culpability. Its public expression is the
obvious _ that this case in its current condition is incapable of
attracting the 67 votes necessary for conviction and removal and
probably would barely attract 45 Republican votes.
</P>
<P>
   But in private, senators from both parties and both inclinations
believe that the Senate would be embarrassed by a full presentation
of the House case in its current condition and without major new
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the only considerations that would keep the case from
being settled before a trial can begin are a respect for those
members who firmly believe censure is a copout or a bad precedent;
a lack of certainty about any new evidence; and a desire to avoid
institutional humiliation of the House by failing to hear at least
the beginning of its case.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, and directly flouting Majority Leader Trent Lott's
wishes, conversations about quick resolution are already occurring
across the aisle and involving such players as Lott's fellow
Mississippian, Thad Cochran, Utah's Orrin Hatch, and Pennsylvania's
Arlen Specter.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything _ including a stunning batch of polls that
show record Clinton job approval, rejection of the House's action,
the opposite of a groundswell for resignation, and no appetite for
a trial _ the Senate's initial view of the House's case is
negative, for three main reasons:
</P>
<P>
   --In the view of senators, those roll call votes on Saturday
were not some political multiple-choice exercise. In passing two
articles and rejecting two, the House is seen as having greatly
changed the nature of the case presented by Ken Starr and rewritten
by Henry Hyde's Judiciary Committee Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The case presented by Starr and committee lawyer David Schippers
was a seamless web of alleged perjury _ stretching from the Paula
Jones case deposition 11 months ago, through the grand jury
appearance in August and through Clinton's 81 cocky answers to 81
set-up questions from Hyde in November.
</P>
<P>
   On the floor, however, 28 Republicans created a majority that
eliminated the article alleging perjury in the civil suit
deposition; and fully 81 Republicans voted to toss the article
framed around the 81 presidential answers. What was left was a
borderline silly case, lacking a bill of particulars, about
Clinton's state of mind in August and in January and the disputed
details of physical contact. The House in effect rejected the
evidentiary basis of its case and left us with trivia.
</P>
<P>
   --Article III presents the Senate with an even thornier set of
problems. As a case alleging obstruction of justice, each of its
seven elements requires the drawing of inferences on the basis of
circumstantial evidence as opposed to direct, He Did It, testimony.
Worse, each of the major prosecution witnesses on these topics
would make the defense's case on cross-examination because they
agree with it.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is legitimate question about the political
force and meaning of the House vote on the article itself.
Advocates of impeachment note that it would not have passed by its
221-212 margin had not five Democrats voted for it. However, it is
more important that it would not have passed without the votes of
five Republicans and one Democrat whose positions will be taken in
the new Congress by people who would have voted the other way.
</P>
<P>
   The legal issue posed by lame duck actions of such a momentous
nature are for other geniuses to decide. But the political fact is
that Article III arrives in the Senate with but a toe-hold on
political legitimacy, and yet by its complex nature it is the one
sure route to a lengthy trial.
</P>
<P>
   --Few noticed, but in the Senate there also remains doubt over
the next Congress's commitment to the case the expiring House
voted.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, 228 members voted for the ministerial job of naming
managers for the Senate case, hiring staff, and the like. This act
will have to be repeated next month.
</P>
<P>
   Off the top, take away five lame duck Republicans and one
Democrat (Paul McHale). Then, notice that two GOP members who voted
against all four impeachment articles (New York's Peter King and
Maryland's Connie Morella) nonetheless gave their ``leadership'' a
vote on this measure.
</P>
<P>
   Already, you're talking about a vote that could easily be as
close as Article III and is certain to be the object of continued
Democratic resistance because of anger at being denied the right to
vote on a censure alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Senators, in short, are doing much more than displaying their
customary caution, process fixation, and independence. They think
that they are being passed something that is much more like a dead
fish than a baton, and they are right.
</P>

THE GOOD MAN OF NANKING: THE DIARIES OF JOHN RABE 
John Rabe, edited by Erwin Wickert, translated by John E. Woods
(Knopf, $26) 
 
 By JON KAMMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They both died in virtual obscurity, but today only one of the
men's names is known worldwide. Oskar Schindler, a playboy Nazi
businessman, seemingly reversed character and saved the lives of
1,300 Jews he employed in a munitions plant in Poland during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   Here then, 61 years after his own acts of heroism and nearly
five decades after his death in poverty and isolation, the name of
another Nazi businessman surfaces for the world to learn and
revere: John Rabe.
</P>
<P>
   A man imbued with decency and courage, along with the naive hope
that Hitler would have ``deep sympathy not only for the distress of
his own people, but for the anguish of the Chinese as well,'' John
Rabe played the leading role in saving 250,000 lives during the
 &UR; other &LR;  Holocaust, the one on the opposite side of the globe during
a horrific period of would-be Japanese conquest.
</P>
<P>
   Far from the Schindler model of a playboy, the bald, thickly
bespectacled Rabe lived and worked in China for most of three
decades, rising to head the Chinese branch of Siemens, the German
industrial and telecommunications giant. He and his wife, Dora,
raised their two children there, and he was an insulin-dependent
diabetic when, at age 55, he found himself at the vortex of
barbarity that would become known, except in Japan, as ``the Rape
of Nanking.''
</P>
<P>
   In his diaries, just published in English as ``The Good Man of
Nanking'' after their German debut last year, Rabe writes of
working tirelessly to establish and maintain an International
Safety Zone to protect non-combatants in Nanking in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   It was to this enclave (the size isn't clear in the book, but
another source describes it as 2{ square miles) that an estimated
250,000 Chinese, too poor to flee, would flock as the rest of the
city became a killing ground.
</P>
<P>
   600 encamp at Rabe's home
</P>
<P>
   With the attack on the city under way, Rabe tells of flinging
open the gates of his home to refugees. More than 600 of them camp
during the 1937-38 winter in his 5,500-square-foot yard, about the
size of a residential lot in central Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   He recounts how, armed with nothing more than bravado and a
swastika armband that was one of the few sobering symbols for
rampaging Japanese troops, he repeatedly ejected invaders from his
and others' property, more than once narrowly averting acts of
rape.
</P>
<P>
   He watches in horror as hundreds upon hundreds of men _ some
former soldiers but many simple laborers _ are rounded up and taken
away to be killed. (At first, most are shot, but within days the
carnage becomes ghastly sport: Many are bayoneted, burned, drowned
or beheaded by sword-wielding officers.)
</P>
<P>
   Rabe pleads with indifferent Japanese military commanders to
halt troops' kidnaping, rape and murder of females of almost any
age, to stop the wholesale looting and burning of the city, to
allow for delivery of food supplies, and even to allow burial of a
Chinese soldier whose body lay rotting just beyond Rabe's door.
Permission was denied for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Mankind at its best and worst
</P>
<P>
   Japan, having taken control of China's northern region of
Manchuria in 1931, grabbed for the rest of the country six years
later and held large areas of China through World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Nanking (now Nanjing), nestled in a bend of the Yangtze River
less than 200 miles inland from Shanghai, had been the nation's
capital for 10 years. After Chiang Kai-shek's government fled
upriver and Chinese troops retreated or deserted en masse, the
city, half emptied of its 1.3 million residents, fell on Dec. 13,
1937.
</P>
<P>
   In betrayal of their own assurances that civilians and soldiers
who surrendered would be treated humanely, the Japanese _ although
widely denying it to this day _ made the city a slaughterhouse,
torture chamber and brothel of brutality for several months.
</P>
<P>
   As documented last year in Iris Chang's surprise bestseller
``The Rape of Nanking,'' at least 200,000 and perhaps upwards of
350,000 noncombatants were slain. (Rabe, with a limited view,
estimated the toll at 50,000 to 60,000.)
</P>
<P>
   One of fewer than two dozen foreigners who did not flee the
attack, Rabe had been a faithful diarist for some years _ not to
court literary recognition but to preserve a record for his family.
</P>
<P>
   But in six months of chronicling the threat to and downfall of
Nanking, he created an indelible portrait of mankind at its best
and worst.
</P>
<P>
   Through a translation by John E. Woods so smooth as to make the
reader forget that any translation was even necessary, ``The Good
Man of Nanking'' presents Rabe's diaries as edited by German
scholar Erwin Wickert, who had visited Rabe in Nanking in 1936 and
later served as German ambassador to China. Interwoven with the
diary entries are letters or official records from other foreign
observers of the atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   Why did he stay?
</P>
<P>
   Months before Nanking fell, Rabe saw what was coming but didn't
budge. With his wife safe in the north and their children in
Germany, he stocked up on insulin, food supplies, gasoline and
other necessities and stood fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a question of morality here, and as a reputable
Hamburg businessman, so far I haven't been able to sidestep it,''
he wrote. ``Anyone who has ever sat in a dugout and held a
trembling Chinese child in each hand through the long hours of an
air raid can understand what I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   It was more than Rabe's personal honor at stake. In one of
several profound ironies permeating not just the book but the times
themselves, Rabe hued to the image of a dedicated Nazi Party
member: ``We do not leave workers _ the poor _ in the lurch when
times are hard!''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese ``have treated me well for three decades now,'' he
wrote on Sept 21. ``The rich are fleeing, the poor must remain
behind. . . . Aren't they in danger of being slaughtered in great
numbers? Shouldn't one make an attempt to help them? Save a few at
least?''
</P>
<P>
   In that spirit, the book soars above what otherwise could be a
too-realistic litany of horrors. It is a gripping, you-are-there
account that ultimately is a story of good, even though the triumph
of good over evil in this case is simply that anything good
survived at all.
</P>
<P>
   No happy ending
</P>
<P>
   When Rabe was ordered by his company to return to Germany in the
spring of 1938, refugees presented him a scroll honoring him as
``the living Buddha for a hundred thousand people.'' His
compatriots recommended him for decorations from both the Chinese
and German governments, medals he eventually would receive without
public ceremony, given Germany's ever-tightening alliances with
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Nanking, Rabe couldn't denounce the atrocities he
had witnessed without making life even more difficult for Chinese
still under Japanese rule. But he tried to speak out to carefully
selected audiences in Berlin, going so far as to screen film
footage that an American missionary had shot. He sent a copy of his
talk to Hitler, who he thought would bring pressure on the Japanese
to act more humanely.
</P>
<P>
   The Gestapo arrested him, and although he was released after a
few hours of interrogation, he was warned firmly not to tell his
story again.
</P>
<P>
   Rabe spent the rest of the war in a low-level position at
Siemens. After Berlin fell to the Russians, he and his wife endured
chronic hunger, repeated displacement and failing health while also
surrounded by incidents of rape and pillaging, albeit a mere shadow
of what Rabe had seen in Nanking.

   ``I am so tired,'' he would write in 1947. ``The `living Buddha
for hundreds of thousands' in Nanking, and a pariah, an outcast
here!''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the book's few flaws, Rabe's death is reported as both
1949 and 1950.
</P>
<P>
   With his wife, he had lived out his life in a room of his
son-in-law's apartment, sometimes receiving food packages from a
missionary family in Nanking that learned of his plight.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese had offered him an apartment and housing in China if
he would testify at Tokyo war-crimes trials.
</P>
<P>
   He declined, telling his grandchildren, ``I didn't want to see
any Japanese hang, although they deserved it. . . . There must be
some atonement, some just punishment; but in my view the judgment
should be spoken only by their own nation.'' &QL;

<P>
   IMPEACH-LAW-FIRM _ WASHINGTON _ If there is a quick solution to
President Clinton's jeopardy in the Senate, it may emerge from the
offices of Verner Liipfert, widely considered the capital's most
influential law firm. The star-studded roster of partners and
associates includes former Sens. Bob Dole and George Mitchell _
already involved in censure discussions _ and former Gov. Ann
Richards of Texas. (Dart, Cox News Service).

<P>
   BAXTER-COLUMN _ Washington _ It came down to that fateful
morning, when it seemed history would finally take precedence over
news. That was the way things felt Saturday, briefly, before Rep.
Bob Livingston got up to announce his resignation and the anxieties
of the moment came rushing back to elbow history aside one more
time. That chaotic, angry moment, when the Democrats began their
chant for Livingston to resign, delaying him for a few seconds from
doing just that, encapsulated as well as any the anguish in a
capital which has come to seem more like a dysfunctional family at
the verge of a breakdown than a two-party government doing the
business of the people. At year's end the toll could be expressed
in this way: Two articles of impeachment, and a permanent scar on
the president's record. (Baxter, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

</P>
<P>
   KIOSK _ As Georgia struggles to balance the increasing cost of
its burgeoning Corrections Department, it is trying a new approach
with people on probation: trust. In metro Atlanta and in Clarke
County, the state is allowing its best probationers to work on the
honor system by reporting to a machine, instead of a person. The
probationer goes to a kiosk, usually in a state building, inserts a
fingerprint card and then responds electronically to a series of
question, such as whether he/she has recently used drugs. Although
the program is in its second year, the state has no accurate
measure of its success because the states tracks probation
recidivism on a three-year cycle. However, the chief probation
officer expects little problems with the 3,000 or so people who
choose this route. Because there is an extra $10 monthly fee for
this type of probation reporting system, the people who do it have
to volunteer. There is reality here, tho. Corrections officials
readily admit that the machines, also being tested in a few other
cities nationwide, can not replace occasional personal contact.

proceeds from bingo, tobacco and tourism. Their opponents are the
state and federal agencies that rule what remains of the
Everglades. And this time, the Indians expect to win. (King, Palm

 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 BY STEVEN T. GOLDBERG 
 ADAPTED FROM ``BUT WHICH MUTUAL FUNDS?'' by STEVEN T. GOLDBERG  
 Copyright 1998 The Kiplinger Washington Editors, Inc. 
 Published by Kiplinger Books  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stock market's turmoil over the past several months has been
unnerving to almost everyone. When is the turbulence going to stop?
Is the stock market safe? What are good funds to buy now?
</P>
<P>
   Such questions beset nearly all investors in times like these.
But investing in mutual funds can be the right choice _ even when
the market is heading down.
</P>
<P>
   And if you invest in fundamentally sound funds that have proven
themselves over the long haul, a market decline is really the best
time to invest, because stocks are cheaper.
 &UR; WHY PUT YOUR MONEY IN THE MARKET? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Given today's market turmoil, many people want to know: Which
way is the stock market headed next, and what can we expect in the
future?
</P>
<P>
   Alas, despite their frequent pronouncements, none of Wall
Street's highly paid analysts have more than a hunch about which
way the stock market will go today, tomorrow or six months from
now. In fact, you're probably better off paying no attention to
predictions about which way the market is going, because nobody
knows.
</P>
<P>
   Just one example of the experts' fallibility: In 1979, Business
Week ran a cover story: ``The Death of Equities.'' The story argued
that the stock market was never again going to offer the kind of
gains it had in the past. Three years later, the biggest bull
market in history began.
</P>
<P>
   While you should ignore the predictions, do bear this in mind:
Through recessions, wars and all other matter of calamities,
stocks, on average, have returned an annualized 11 percent since
1926. That compares to 5.4 percent for government bonds, and 3.7
percent for ``safe'' cash investments such as short-term Treasury
bills, bank certificates of deposits and money-market funds.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, inflation has averaged 3.1 percent. After inflation,
stocks have actually been less likely to lose money over five-year
periods than bonds or cash.
</P>
<P>
   Over all five-year periods since 1926, stocks have outperformed
bonds and cash more than three-quarters of the time.
</P>
<P>
   But before you put all your money into stocks, remember:
</P>
<P>
   _ Stocks are far more volatile than bonds, meaning their returns
bounce around more from month to month and year to year. Cash is
the least volatile investment.
</P>
<P>
   _ In their worst year (1931), stocks plunged 43 percent, while
long-term corporate bonds lost only 8.1 percent in their poorest
year (1969), and the worst return on cash was a minuscule loss of
0.02 percent (in 1938).
</P>
<P>
   _ Stocks have fallen by at least 20 percent about once every
five years since 1926. There's nothing unique about this year's
decline. On average, it has taken two years and five months to
break even for an investor who put money into stocks just before a
20 percent or greater drop.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1929 crash (when stocks lost 86 percent of their value
over three years), though, it took until 1944 to break even. And
after the brutal 1973-74 bear market (when stocks fell 48 percent),
it took more than three years to break even _ and 10 years to break
even after inflation.
</P>
<P>
   You get the idea: Stocks are great long-term investments; bonds
and cash make more sense for shorter time periods. Think of stocks
as a roller coaster, bonds as bumper cars and cash as a carousel.
And tune out prognostications about which will do best in the short
run.
 &UR; BEFORE YOU GET STARTED &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you've decided to invest in stock funds, there are a few
things you should do before getting started.
</P>
<P>
   First, make sure you pay off high-interest debt such as credit
cards. Next, amass a cash cushion equal to at least three months of
your after-tax salary in a bank CD or a money-market account. Or,
if you are bolder, take out a home-equity line of credit that you
can tap in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've taken those steps, there are two things you'll need
to determine about yourself: Can you tolerate fear-inspiring market
declines like the recent one without selling your stock funds? And
how long will it be until you'll need your money?
</P>
<P>
   To find out how much risk you can handle, answer the following
two questions:
</P>
<P>
   1. The news media is filled with stories quoting experts who
predict stocks will lose money in the coming decade. Many suggest
investing in real estate. You would:
</P>
<P>
   a. consider selling some stocks funds and buying real estate
</P>
<P>
   b. be concerned, but stick to your long-term goals
</P>
<P>
   c. dismiss the articles as a sign of unwarranted pessimism over
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   2. Which of the following statements best describes you:
</P>
<P>
   a. I often change my mind and have trouble sticking to a plan.
</P>
<P>
   b. I can stay with a strategy as long as it seems to be doing
well.
</P>
<P>
   c. Once I make up my mind to do something, I tend to follow
through with it regardless of the obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   If you answered ``a'' both times, consider yourself a low-risk
investor. If you answered with one ``a'' and one ``b,'' or two
``b's,'' or one ``a'' and one ``c,'' you're a medium-risk investor.
</P>
<P>
   If you answered with at least one ``c'' and no ``a's,'' you're a
high-risk investor _ able to hold on to stocks no matter how rough
the market gets.
 &UR; HOW MUCH OF YOUR MONEY SHOULD YOU INVEST IN STOCKS? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some stockbrokers and financial planners would have you believe
that figuring out how much to invest in stocks and lower-risk
investments is as difficult as calculus. Not so.
</P>
<P>
   Following are two tables: one for investing for retirement and
the second for investing to meet all other goals.
</P>
<P>
   The table for retirement calls for you to invest a larger
portion of your money in stocks. That's because most people can
expect to live to be 85 or 90 years old _ a long time for your
money to grow, even in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   HOW MUCH OF YOUR MONEY TO INVEST IN STOCKS FOR RETIREMENT OR
WHILE IN RETIREMENT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (The column on the left represents the number of years until
retirement or your age in retirement)
 &UR; .........................TOLERANCE FOR RISK &QL; 
 &UR; ........................LOW...............MODERATE.........HIGH &QL; 
 &UR; More than 15 yrs.........100 percent....100 percent....100 percent &QL;

 &UR; Late retirement (over age 75).30.........40.............50 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HOW MUCH TO INVEST IN STOCKS FOR ALL GOALS EXCEPT RETIREMENT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (The column on the left represents the number of years until
you'll need the money)
 &UR; ....................TOLERANCE FOR RISK &QL; 
 &UR; ....................LOW............MODERATE............HIGH &QL; 
 &UR; More than 15 yrs....80 percent........100 percent.....100 percent &QL; 
 &UR; 10 to 15 yrs........60.................80.............100 &QL; 
 &UR; 6 to 10 yrs.........55.................70..............90 &QL; 
 &UR; 4 to 6 yrs..........30.................40..............60 &QL; 
 &UR; 2 to 4..............10.................25..............35 &QL; 
 &UR; 0 to 2...............0..................0...............0 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Armed with this knowledge, and details that I'll give you on
which funds to buy in the next article, there's no need for you to
buy a fund with a sales charge, or to pay a stock broker or
financial adviser to help you select funds.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, once you become accustomed to the ups and downs of
the market, you may find you're more able to tolerate them. If so,
take the risk test again and see if you should increase the
percentage of your money you put into stock funds.
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR: GETTING STARTED &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to know you need to get started investing _ or
that you need to invest in a more methodical way. It's another
thing to actually pull the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Procrastination is the enemy of investors. You know all the
excuses: Either you don't have enough money, you'd rather spend it
on something else, the market seems too risky just now or you're
already so far behind that starting would be pointless.
</P>
<P>
   You'll feel better about making a move if, instead of plunging
in, you take a tentative step or two. Invest a modest but fixed
amount from your salary in shares of stock funds every month.
</P>
<P>
   Funds often allow a monthly (or quarterly) minimum investment of
as little as $25 or $50, as long as you agree to make regular,
automatic investments via your checking account. Having the fund
company take the money out of your bank account each month is a big
plus.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a 401(k) or 403(b) retirement plan at work, your
employer will similarly invest money straight from your paycheck.
And most companies match at least part of your investment, offering
an instant, substantial return.
</P>
<P>
   Money you don't see is money you won't spend and money you soon
will find you hardly miss. If you have to sit down and write a
check to a mutual fund every month, it's much easier to find
something else you'd rather spend the money on than your future.

   CAVIAR (Undated) _ A caviar connoisseur is someone who relishes
the various. Bursting between the tongue and the roof of the mouth,
caviar never tastes the same. Its flavor varies from fish to fish,
region to region, season to season. That is part of its allure.
This year, however, the wild disparity in caviar prices is more
than matched by incongruent flavor, texture and quality of the roe.

<P>
   CAVIAR-FARM (Davis, Calif.) _ For two decades and more, Mats and
Dafne Engstrom have been working on a project that he compares to
making paper by planting a forest. Their goal is to produce caviar
comparable to that from the Caspian Sea _ specifically the variety
known as osetra _ from the eggs of farm-raised California sturgeon.
The process works well; the problem is that it takes the
slow-growing sturgeon a very long time to reach an age at which
they produce roe. This is the future of caviar now that the Caspian
Sea is almost depleted of sturgeon. By R.W. Apple Jr.

what happened. ``It was astonishing,'' said Gerard Yvernault, who

<HEADLINE>
49ERS COACH NEEDS TO ACQUIRE SOME SWAGGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ About a year ago, an NFL executive explained how
he knew that Joe Bugel couldn't be a successful head coach in the
NFL. He had seen Bugel in operation with the Arizona Cardinals,
obliging the owner, accommodating the players, trying to keep
everybody happy.
</P>
<P>
   Bugel, according to this executive, never fought for anything.
He wasn't arrogant, bullying, manipulative, political or
egomaniacal. In other words, he didn't have a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Bugel spent the rest of that season making this executive look
prophetic, guiding the Raiders into an abyss.
</P>
<P>
   When Steve Mariucci took over the San Francisco 49ers, some
people had the same concerns about him. He was eager to please, a
gusher like Bugel, although obviously brighter and more polished.
Then his style of coaching helped the Niners win 11 straight games
and home-field advantage through the playoffs. The questions went
away.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Niners are at another stage, and there are new
questions. Does the team run enough? Does it run too much? Does it
run just the right amount, but not in the right situations?
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci has heard it all in the last three weeks. He showed
signs of only mild exasperation on Sunday, when the news media
asked him to justify certain plays in the Niners' 24-21 loss to New
England. It was up to Steve Young, under interrogation about one of
the running plays, to say: ``Come on, be fair, you were on us
before about not running enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci had an answer for each criticism, but there was a note
of apology underneath. He seems to know that he has been entrusted
with a revered and beloved franchise, and every loss makes him look
somebody who defaced a national landmark.
</P>
<P>
   This is laudable, just like all of Mariucci's public behavior.
He has defined himself as the man who sends post cards to his
mother from road games, the coach who gripped Bryant Young's hand
tightly and compassionately while they waited together for a
stretcher to cart the big defense tackle away for the rest of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Every now and then, though, it would be nice to see a little
swagger from Mariucci, a reminder that he's in charge.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, it would have taken boundless hubris for him to say:
This is my team. But now, why not? Who would fight back? The front
office is barren. The players need a rudder, need to believe that
their boss is unimpeachable. The news media need to see a coach who
is open-minded but not malleable.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, it's not clear whether Mariucci is following his own
vision for the team or allowing too many lobbyists to influence
him.
</P>
<P>
   After the overtime win against pitiful Carolina two weeks ago,
he admitted he had given up on the running game and vowed to do
better. The news media had chastised him, and the offensive linemen
had pleaded with him. Was he being a good listener, an open-minded
and enlightened coach? Or was he giving in?
</P>
<P>
   Only he knows for sure, but his players will know instinctively.
If he's doing things his way, and has absolute confidence, they
will get behind him. In the NFL, an authoritative coach gets the
most out of his players. A vacillating coach gets the minimum.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that Mariucci needs to be Jimmy Johnson or
Bill Parcells. It's distressing enough that Bill Parcells gets away
with being Bill Parcells, that such a tyrant can be such a winner.
But there's room for other methods, for nice guys to finish first.
Mike Shanahan isn't a bully, and he has flourished.
</P>
<P>
   But Shanahan also projects immense confidence. He seems open to
suggestion but not second-guessing. Mariucci works a little harder
to win over his critics. I appreciate his fundamental decency, but
I wonder if he is trying to keep us all happy all the time. That's
a losing proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'm wrong, and Mariucci hasn't yielded to anyone. If he's
doing what comes naturally, fine. If he's suppressing his
instincts, he's doing himself an injustice.
</P>

   CAVIAR (Undated) _ A caviar connoisseur is someone who relishes
the various. Bursting between the tongue and the roof of the mouth,
caviar never tastes the same. Its flavor varies from fish to fish,
region to region, season to season. That is part of its allure.
This year, however, the wild disparity in caviar prices is more
than matched by incongruent flavor, texture and quality of the roe.

   CAVIAR-FARM (Davis, Calif.) _ For two decades and more, Mats and
Dafne Engstrom have been working on a project that he compares to
making paper by planting a forest. Their goal is to produce caviar
comparable to that from the Caspian Sea _ specifically the variety
known as osetra _ from the eggs of farm-raised California sturgeon.
The process works well; the problem is that it takes the
slow-growing sturgeon a very long time to reach an age at which
they produce roe. This is the future of caviar now that the Caspian
Sea is almost depleted of sturgeon. By R.W. Apple Jr.

 &HT;        CLINTON'S LEGAL DEFENSE FUND GETS STEADY DONATIONS, BUT
LEGAL FEES GROW   By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Dec. 21, -- The impeachment process could not only
cost President Bill Clinton his job, but also a small fortune in
legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons already owe $7 million and counting in lawyer's
bills from the Paula Jones sexual harassment case and Whitewater
land deal investigation, according to Tony Essaye, executive
director of the Clinton Legal Expense Trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anyone with those kind of legal fees would be
incredibly concerned,'' said Essaye, who oversees a trust of
private donations collected to help pay for the Clintons' legal
costs. ``We are doing the best we can to meet this enormous
potential burden to the Clintons. We are cautiously optimistic
about what we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   The trust had raised only $2.2 million as of August, the last
time numbers were made available.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the White House and Essaye said they didn't know
yet how much the impeachment process has cost Clinton in personal
legal fees. They also could not estimate the cost of a Senate
trial.
</P>
<P>
   In his official capacity, Clinton is represented by the White
House counsel, which is paid for by taxpayers, Essaye said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton must pay fees to his private lawyer, David Kendall,
whom he hired to assist the White House counsel in defending him,
Essaye said.
</P>
<P>
   The government will wind up paying most costs related to the
impeachment process. But if the $900,000 the House Judiciary
Committee spent pursuing Clinton in the impeachment inquiry alone
is any indication, he will have to pay plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's insurance policy paid off the $850,000 settlement in
the Paula Jones case, according to a White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the presidential legal bill was $6 million. The trust
had collected $2.2 million dollars and paid out 1.25 million to the
president's lawyers, Essaye said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president would have to pay any amount leftover from what
we could not pay,'' Essaye said. ``Of course, the president could
always make money doing lectures and appearances when he leaves
office. But I think there is a better use of his time.''
</P>
<P>
   During the impeachment process, the trust has received a
``steady flow of donations,'' from individuals allowed to
contribute up to $10,000 a year. Essaye said the trust received
calls from folks concerned with Clinton's bills.
</P>
<P>
   Essaye would not release information about how much money has
been raised since August and said the next figures would be made
available in February.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for the trust, Richard M. Lucas, said he was
confident the donations would ``substantially'' reduce the amount
owed by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's approval rating has been high and people want
to help him,'' Lucas said. ``There have been no peaks or valleys in
donations.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas said he didn't think Clinton's impeachment battle needed
publicity. The direct mailings soliciting donations for Clinton's
legal bills don't mention it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donors are well aware of what they [the Clintons] are going
through.'' Lucas said.

JUDGE BARS PROSECUTORS FROM CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A Superior Court judge disqualified the entire
San Francisco district attorney's office from handling the
high-profile trial in the murder of a city crime boss, saying
prosecutor Terence Hallinan illegally tried to approach the judge
in private.
</P>
<P>
   Judge William Cahill took the highly unusual legal step Monday,
saying Hallinan walked into his chambers Friday and asked him to
review a letter about the prosecution's handling of the case.
Hallinan allegedly tried to speak with the judge about a proposed
letter to the editor to see if the document violated Cahill's gag
order.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill said that under California law, such ``ex-parte,'' or
one-sided, contacts are forbidden. Hallinan should have consulted
with defense attorneys before approaching the judge about a pending
case, Cahill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until the ex-parte events of Dec. 18, this court believed
it was still possible for these defendants to receive a fair trial
with the San Francisco district attorney's office as prosecutor,''
Cahill wrote in his order. ``This is no longer the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Cahill ordered the case be turned over to the state attorney
general for prosecution. The judge indicated that he still intends
to preside over the trial, which has not yet been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill said he may consider sanctions against Hallinan after the
trial, for missteps that have delayed the case, which has been
postponed several times since March and may not begin until
mid-1999.
</P>
<P>
   The recusal order by Cahill is the latest setback for Hallinan
in the murder trial of four men accused of killing convicted crime
boss Cuong Tran in November 1996 in a battle over turf.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 2, Cahill declared a mistrial after jurors admitted
reading Hallinan's published statements linking the four Tran
defendants to a second unsolved killing _ that of attorney Dennis
Natali _ that they are not accused of committing.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill earlier also chided Hallinan about previous public
statements and placed the district attorney under a gag order.
</P>
<P>
   Hallinan was not immediately available for comment Monday night.
His spokesman, John Shanley, said: ``We're very disappointed with
the judge's decision.''

`THIN RED' CROSSES THE LINE STUNNINGLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Can beauty and ugliness be the workings of one
mind, the features of the same face? That's the question at the
heart of Terrence Malick's visually stunning ``The Thin Red Line,''
a movie that mixes philosophical ruminations, heart-pounding battle
sequences and idyllic visions of nature into a thoughtful, though
sometimes meandering mix of abstractions that somehow manage to add
up to a beautifully lyrical cinematic epic.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone familiar with Malick's two previous minor masterpieces _
1973's low-key, killers-on-the-run ``Badlands'' and the sweeping
immigration epic ``Days of Heaven'' (Malick's last film, made 20
years ago) _ will recognize the reclusive writer-director's touches
everywhere in this remarkable new work. ``The Thin Red Line'' is
brimming with biblical allusions, meditative camera work,
perplexing plot lines and a singular vision of the world that can
be as confusing as it is captivating.
</P>
<P>
   Malick focuses that vision here on Guadalcanal Island, loosely
adapting James Jones' 1962 novel about a crack infantry unit
battling the entrenched Japanese in one of the key battles of World
War II. Comparisons to the year's other celebrated war movie,
``Saving Private Ryan,'' are inevitable, but ultimately, rather
pointless. Aside from some complex, expertly filmed battle
sequences, the two films are as distinct as the military theaters
in which they are set.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thin Red Line'' boasts a wide-ranging array of characters,
many of whom are introduced and then discarded, only to be seen
again an hour later. Confusing voice-over work doesn't help with
the story's coherence, either. Sometimes we're not sure which
character is talking; sometimes (mostly in the case of Nick Nolte)
we're not sure just what they're saying. Another problem: Two of
the lead soldiers (Jim Caviezel and Ben Chaplin) look somewhat
alike, and as they wear the same style of uniform and battle
helmet, it's often hard to tell them apart.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, given the way Malick's screenplay and direction often
renders characterization a moot point anyway, such confusion is
almost inevitable. After a 10-minute prologue that features images
of Guadalcanal's Melanesian inhabitants swimming in turquoise
waters and collecting shells, Malick begins to gradually introduce
the movie's sprawling cast. Early scenes focus on the soft-spoken
Kentucky soldier, Pvt. Witt (Caviezel), and his thematic opposite,
Sgt. Welsh (Sean Penn), a cynic trying to harden himself to the
random brutality that war brings.
</P>
<P>
   Welsh is one of the leaders of Charlie company, the army
infantry unit sent to Guadalcanal to displace the Japanese. Other
members of the company include Lt. Col. Tall (Nick Nolte), a career
officer who sees the invasion as a chance to make a name for
himself; Capt. Staros (Elias Koteas), a conscientious commander not
eager to throw his men into a suicide mission; and Pvt. Bell (Ben
Chaplin), a man haunted by visions of the wife he left back home.
(John Travolta and George Clooney appear in brief cameos that are
ultimately more distracting than satisfying.)
</P>
<P>
   Through these men and cinematographer John Toll's striking
island paradise imagery, Malick contemplates evil and love, life
and death, salvation and the way war poisons the soul. Anyone
expecting a straightforward narrative likely will be disappointed
by the way Malick circles his ideas like one of the film's
often-shown birds looking for prey. But the film rarely fails to
absorb, and ultimately proves quite rewarding on a number of
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit for this success belongs to Toll's indelible
photography and Hans Zimmer's excellent score, both of which should
be rewarded with Oscar nominations. Although the movie as a whole
does not consistently achieve such greatness, it dares enough to
try. We can only hope Malick decides to try again before another 20
years pass. &UR;

   Frozen pizza? Chop suey? Corned beef and cabbage? (begin ital)
Reindeer (end ital) ? Those are just a few untraditional dishes
eaten in the Valley of the Sun, as the Phoenix area is known, as
traditional Christmas meals. We also heard from devoted cooks who
make the ethnic meals that have been in their families for decades,
such as Jack and Linda Yearington of Apache Junction, who are
fourth-generation Bohemian-Americans and whose family has been
serving the same thing for 110 years _ duck with potato dumplings
and sauerkraut, barley with mushrooms, and apricot (begin ital)
kolaches (end ital) for dessert.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, the traditional family-based ethnic meals happen
on Christmas Eve _ which is also the night the animals talk among
themselves, according to a Ukrainian/Polish tradition, so they get
a little something extra for dinner, too, explained Cheryle Wood of
Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Wood keeps the foods and customs she grew up with alive every
year for her family and her father, who just turned 89. The unusual
Christmas borscht that her family loves starts with several cups of
raw oatmeal, buttermilk, lemon juice and a slice of black bread,
fermented for three days, then strained, squeezed through a cloth
until thick, and thinned. Mushrooms and fried onions are added, and
it's served in a bowl with mashed potatoes in the middle. Wood
never has seen a similar recipe or even heard of anyone else who
makes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we always have at least 13 chairs at the table _ one was
for the Christ child _ and you put straw under the tablecloth, to
represent the manger,'' Wood explained.
</P>
<P>
   In Scottsdale, Doris Allen's traditional Czech Catholic/Lutheran
meal starts with communion wafers sandwiched together with honey to
symbolize God's blessings, and a clove of garlic dipped in honey
for good health. Wine, soup, roast beef and Polish sausage, fish,
sardines, lima beans and carrots, and (begin ital) opakansi, (end
ital) small bread rolls steamed with poppy seeds and honey, are the
rest of the meal.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Reichmann of Peoria said that on Christmas Eve, her family
enjoys Lebanese food cooked by her 89-year-old (begin ital) sittie,
(end ital) or grandmother. She makes kibbeh (raw twice-ground meat
mixed with wheat, salt, onion and a little cinnamon, served with
melted butter) and (begin ital) yabra (end ital) - grape or cabbage
leaves stuffed with ground meat, rice, clarified butter and lemon
juice with ground round steak instead of lamb.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this year, Reichmann's (begin ital) sittie (end
ital) fell, so other family members hope she can coach them on the
preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching other family members is crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Conway's 92-year-old Italian grandfather, Fred Bove, makes
the lasagna and meatballs for his family's traditional meal in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``His grandkids help,'' Conway said, adding that there's
something about his hands that make the food special.
</P>
<P>
   In Flagstaff, Stacie Zanzucchi's mother-in-law, Sally, makes
hundreds of homemade ravioli, with meat and meatless, enough to
feed 40 to 50 people. They're on the table with other traditional
foods, Zanzucchi said, but that's what everybody goes for first.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tradition started when the grandfather came to this
country in 1903,'' Zanzucchi said.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband has 10 brothers and a sister scattered around the
country, but they come home every Christmas for homemade ravioli.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought it was funny when they started dispersing around
the country and found not everybody ate ravioli on Christmas Day,''
Zanzucchi said.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people do eat Italian, and readers mentioned meals
centered on lasagna, manicotti, stuffed shells, chicken cacciatore,
and, usually, cannoli for dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Terri Harrington of Mesa centers her Christmas on an Italian
soup called (begin ital) cupelette, (end ital) a recipe her French
grandmother got from her Italian neighbors when she immigrated to a
little town in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be 40 and I've eaten it every year for Christmas Eve
since I was 2,'' Harrington said. ``It's a soup with homemade
noodles formed into ravioli, and inside them is veal, beef and
pork. I feed about 45 on Christmas Eve every year, and it takes
about nine hours to prepare. But my family couldn't have Christmas
without it.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her mom and sisters and daughters have a Saturday ``soup
day'' to make and freeze the soup, which is put together the
morning before Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Sallie Ann Gatty and her mother cook an Italian Christmas Eve
dish, too: Seven different fish cooked seven different ways, and
seven vegetables cooked seven different ways. Her family is in the
seventh generation of doing this. Her cousins in other parts of the
country prepare the same meal.
</P>
<P>
   Gatty's is a dressed-up, formal sit-down dinner, this year for
about 27 people. The menu includes shrimp cocktail; baked clams;
spaghetti with either clam sauce or fish sauce with clams, shrimp
and squid; fried calamari; scallops; fried shrimp; either flounder,
grouper or swordfish; and baby smelts or sardines. When she moved
to the Valley 21 years ago, it was impossible to get all this
stuff, Gatty said, and her mother brought it all from New York in
boxes on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The vegetables include asparagus breaded and fried; cauliflower;
broccoli; stuffed artichokes; stuffed mushrooms; and rapini, an
Italian broccolilike green vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, she adds or subtracts something, Gatty said. Since
moving to Arizona, she's added seviche, a Latin American method of
marinating fish.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas meals are labor-intensive, expensive feasts, and
luxury foods are featured in many of the traditions people have
followed or created.
</P>
<P>
   Prime rib (served in the English tradition, or not) and steaks
fall into this category, as does the beef tenderloin that Karen
Robinson of Scottsdale learned to roast from master chef Walter
Leibel years ago when her sisters worked at the Paradise Valley
Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Darlene DeFranze of north Scottsdale said, ``We have fish on
Christmas Eve, because we were raised Catholic,'' referring to the
traditional fast prohibiting meat before midnight Mass. ``We
usually have lobster gravy _ lobster in a red sauce served over
linguine.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Christmas choices are oyster stew, lobster tails, crab
chowder and crab cakes. They sometimes aren't for religious
reasons: Shirley Lineham of Sun City West said her daughter started
the tradition of baked trout stuffed with crab, shrimp and
mushrooms because they didn't want to eat red meat.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Wilson of Fountain Hills said, ``We have jambalaya with
high-quality seafood. We just got sick of the traditional stuff. We
like seafood. That's about it. My husband tried it one year and we
liked it and we've done it ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hobbses in Mesa have lobster with drawn garlic butter
because it's their favorite food _ she's from New York and he's
from Boston.
</P>
<P>
   American regional food traditions are followed for the same
reasons as ethnic ones: to keep tradition alive.
</P>
<P>
   Marrilyn Nowlan, who lives in Sun City Grand, said everybody in
her family makes beef and homemade noodles for Christmas, which
``wouldn't be unusual back in Indiana.'' Thin egg noodles are
cooked in beef broth and served over mashed potatoes. The meal is
such a family favorite that when Nowlan's mother turned 100 and
relatives from seven states visited, that's what they had to eat.
</P>
<P>
   At Arrowhead Ranch in Glendale, Glenda York makes a meal called
Low Country Boil or Frogmore Stew, traditional in the Beaufort,
S.C., area, where her dad was raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad passed away when my son was 6 months old, and instead
of just talking about him to our son, we wanted a way to bring in
things we had been talking about and make him a real part of his
life,'' York said.
</P>
<P>
   The stew is easy, fun and participatory, York explained, and she
does it for 12 to 30 people, many of whom don't know the other
guests. Weather permitting, the stew is cooked outdoors in a giant
pot over propane. Every 15 minutes, ingredients are added to
boiling water: a spice bag, lemons, Vidalia onions, hot spicy
sausage, new potatoes, shrimp, corn on the cob, and crab, if you
want.
</P>
<P>
   The water is drained off and the food tipped out onto picnic
tables covered with butcher-block paper. The first time, ``some
people kind of stand back, shocked,'' York said. ``But by the time
it's over, everybody can go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   John Betka's chop suey meal started as a joke, when he was
telling his eight siblings a few years ago how he remembered their
mother making chop suey a couple of days before Christmas. None of
the others remembered it. Now, in Scottsdale, he makes it for the
holiday, and he writes fake R.S.V.P. letters from celebrities
declining to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of fun with it,'' Betka said. ``We laugh a lot
and it bonds our family pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Cairns home, Christmas smells like corned beef. The
Cairnses started eating it with cabbage at least 20 years ago in
their Pinetop second home, where they always spent Christmas Eve
skiing at Sunrise. They wanted to watch the kids open gifts,
instead of standing around in the kitchen, and they picked a
favorite meal that cooks itself in one pot.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the kids are long gone, and they have Christmas in Gilbert,
``but we've continued to do the same thing,'' Mary Cairns said.
``And, of course, we have to eat early enough, at 1 or 2 in the
afternoon, so we can have corned beef sandwiches on rye bread in
the evening.''
</P>
<P>
   When Janet Cole of Phoenix was a single parent, money was tight
and she was stressing out when she asked her two kids, then ages 12
and 16, what they wanted for Christmas dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `Mom, we really don't like sitting down to a big
fancy dinner. We don't like to see you knock yourself out, like
Thanksgiving. For Christmas, what we really, really want is pizza.'
They like those cheap frozen pizzas, from the supermarket! So
that's our traditional Christmas frozen pizza,'' Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, the money's better, they're grown, but they still come
over and expect frozen pizza for Christmas. My current husband
says, `OK, frozen pizza.' We open presents and then eat pizza. And
later in the day, stepdad and I have a nice meal.''
</P>
<P>
   Finances had no part in the Seftons' decision to feature
reindeer meat at their holiday meal, because it's very expensive.
They eat a lot of game, and they saw it at a game market and
``thought it sounded like a great Christmas entree,'' Becky Sefton
of Scottsdale explained, laughing a little, because she knows how
it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people say, `Oh, you eat deer.' It's not. It's
reindeer. It's from Alaska.'' And it's farm-raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``When our kids were little, they were morbid about it. They
(begin ital) (end ital) love it.''
</P>
<P>
   They had a Christmas village scene complete with Santa and
sleigh, and they put black hoods on the reindeer. This Christmas,
it's just the two of them, so they've ordered a small roast. But
the kids call to make sure their parents are having reindeer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is year number eight,'' Sefton said, ``so if we're
correct, we're eating Donder this year.'' &QL;

LAUGHTER ADDS LIFT TO HOLIDAY GIFT-GIVING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a previous column, I said that I was learning to wrestle by
watching a video called ``Wrestling For Moms'' or ``Hugging With An
Attitude.'' I thought that if I learned to wrestle, I would have a
remote chance of getting closer than arm's length to at least one
of my two sons.
</P>
<P>
   Well, after spending several hours sitting in a hot tub laced
with Epsom salts, I have come to the conclusion that hugging is
highly overrated. In the future, I shall be content with that
handshake of gratitude and affection that they give me on the third
Friday of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Fridays, we've got the big day coming up this
Friday. It's going to be down to the wire for me, but I think I'll
have a gift for everyone I'll see on Christmas Day by tomorrow. I
refuse to go to the mall on Christmas Eve. There's no rational
reason for that deadline except that I just feel like I'm a notch
above a hopeless procrastinator if I cut myself off on the 23rd. As
for the folks I won't see until after Christmas Day, well, I'll
just catch some of those after-Christmas sales for them. It's the
thought behind the gift not the date on the receipt that counts,
right?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I finally managed to come up with the perfect gift for
my good friend Meredith. Every year I agonize over what to get
Meredith, the woman who has everything. Clothes, jewelry, perfume,
gold, incense and myrrh. You name it, she has it. Oh, she's always
very gracious in accepting the gift. She never even admits that she
already has one. It's usually one of her kids or her husband who
says, ``Hey, don't you already have one of those?''
</P>
<P>
   This year I decided to give Meredith a gift that she could add
to her collection. When I handed her the festive green and red
envelope, she looked puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merry Christmas, Meredith,'' I said smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it a gift certificate?'' she asked. ``Did you give up on
trying to select a present for me? I'm really not hard to please.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, Meredith,'' I said. ``It's not a gift certificate.''
</P>
<P>
   She opened the envelope and inside was a personal check from me
to her for $1,000. However, I had written the word ``VOID'' across
the front of the check with a bold red marker.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's this?'' she asked as she raised her eyebrows
quizzically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meredith, when I balanced my checkbook last week, I noticed
that you still had not deposited the check I wrote you two months
ago for the tickets to that concert. You did the same thing last
year when I wrote you a check for the women's retreat T-shirts,
except it took you four months to deposit that one. I figured that
since you keep my checks so long, you would enjoy one that you
never had to deposit at all.''
</P>
<P>
   We both laughed until tears fell from our eyes, and then I gave
Meredith her real gift, a lovely silk scarf that was exactly like
the one she was wearing.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, I tried. It's the thought that counts, right?

NO HAMMING IT UP FOR TRADI TIONAL DINNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE PORTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - This just in, from the Tidings of Great Joy division:
You can eat whatever you want for Christmas dinner. There is no
umbilical link between a kitchen in chaos and the first Noel.
</P>
<P>
   And you do not have to lose your minds like my family did just
to discover this.
</P>
<P>
   We did not figure it out for a long time. Primarily because Mom
quietly, competently carried the burden of getting Christmas dinner
on the table. We helped out here and there, but it was her
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in the middle of the day, the table became magically
full of food, and we ate Christmas dinner, and it was good, and
that was that, other than the conversation about whether it was too
close to Thanksgiving to eat turkey again.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a year when Mom had foot surgery, and my sister and I
took over the controls. We are certified adults (begin ital) and
(end ital) good cooks, but we were overwhelmed. We were attempting
a large-scale dinner in my mother's small kitchen, with pots and
pans we were not accustomed to and ingredients we could not find.
</P>
<P>
   My mother could only direct this doomed operation from the
couch, valiantly trying to instruct us in the ways of raw ham. It
did not help that we were tired from getting up at dawn because
Santa had come. It did not help that the baby was cranky. It
certainly did not help that everyone was starving and that dinner
was two hours late.
</P>
<P>
   It was only when things were finally on the table, in a somewhat
sorry state, that we realized how bizarre it is to be
``traditional'' when it doesn't even make sense. We had gotten all
tired and stressed and somewhat postal over a dinner we didn't even
(begin ital) ``like'' (end ital) that much.
</P>
<P>
   Where did all this come from, this ham and turkey, ham and
turkey, ham and turkey? Who took the vows that said there would be
scalloped potatoes and green beans and pie on Christmas Day, even
though you went to church at midnight and then stayed up until 3:30
a.m. putting together the trike? Hmmm? Who decided this menu? Who
started this mess?
</P>
<P>
   We drew the line. From that day forward, we decided, we would
have spaghetti and meatballs for Christmas dinner.
</P>
<P>
   It is, no contest, our family's most beloved meal. We revere
spaghetti sauce as art, as religion. We believe meatballs and
garlic bread are life necessities. We would give you the recipe,
but then we'd have to kill you.
</P>
<P>
   My dad tinkered with his spaghetti sauce for probably 25 years,
with the utmost attention to detail. We were the direct
beneficiaries. The sauce simmered on the stove for hours and made
the house smell so good _ even upstairs _ that I would sneak tastes
of it all day long.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner-table post-mortem of each batch was of monumental
importance, and I am not exaggerating. Hunt's vs. Contadina, and
later Contadina vs. Progresso, ad infinitum. The basil is too
strong this time, the garlic not strong enough. The sauce is too
thick, the sauce is too thin. The meatballs too this, too that.
</P>
<P>
   None of us truly cared, because it was always great. I think the
real reason behind the spaghetti-sauce think tank was to ensure
that we would carry the significance of sauce with us for life.
Even the littlest Porter kids understand spaghetti as a metaphor,
graduating from the baby world of having it cut up for them to the
big-kid world of twirling it on their own forks.
</P>
<P>
   Spaghetti as Christmas dinner is perfect for us. The sauce
simmers on the stove all day on Christmas Eve, so all we do on
Christmas Day is heat it up, boil water for the pasta and bake the
garlic bread. Dinner is ready whenever we want it to be. The
kitchen is not a mess. The kids are not starving. We are happy
campers to be eating our very favorite family meal. Everyone eats
seconds. My brother has thirds. The whole thing is more ours than
``tradition'' could ever be.
</P>
<P>
   And because our dad died several years ago, this brings him back
to the Christmas dinner table more than we possibly could have
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   We admit there's a risk of the youngest generation growing up
believing they are ham-deprived, turning to friends and therapists
for solace and scalloped potatoes, rolling their eyes in mock abuse
when we discuss the basil. They could grow up and rebel, and decide
that in their homes there will always be roast beef and game hens,
crescent rolls and 16 side dishes. They could complain to their
spouses someday, about how they grew up believing there was garlic
bread in Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   I'm thinking the more immediate risk, however, is that we won't
be able to fit enough chairs at the table for all their friends. &QL;

PAPERS WENT BIG WITH IMPEACHMENT HEADLINES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating from Monday night file to correct name of Las Vegas
paper in penultimate graf.)  (rl) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Headline sizes seen two or three times in a generation were on
display Sunday in the United States' major newspapers, as editors
and reporters strove to make their coverage match, in its sweep,
its depth and its manner, the gravity of the second impeachment of
a president in American history.
</P>
<P>
   And few if any renditions of the stark word ``impeached'' were
larger than the one used by The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, which
featured type 2 3/4 inches deep. Beyond the sheer size of its
typeface, The Post-Dispatch distinguished itself by reserving its
entire front page for a narrative essay written out of St. Louis,
prompting strong objections from all five members of the
newspaper's Washington bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, they objected to the writer's failure to
disclose that he was basing his information largely on televised
coverage of the debate and was not on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The essay, by senior staff writer Harry Levins, began, ``New
York Democrat Charles Rangel rose Saturday to utter one of the rare
sentences on which both sides of the House of Representatives could
agree: `Mr. Speaker, the whole world is watching.'''
</P>
<P>
   In studied contrast to traditional news-writing style, which
calls for the most important information to be billboarded at the
top of an article, the essay did not mention President Clinton's
name until the fifth paragraph, and the actual votes on the four
articles of impeachment were not mentioned until 31 inches into a
34-inch narrative.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Cole Campbell, The Post-Dispatch's editor, said, the
newspaper was following the path laid out by weekly news magazines
by offering interpretation, color and context to a readership
familiar with the basic facts.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two decades, newspapers have been leaning
increasingly on texture and detail in their coverage. But rarely do
they substitute texture and mood for facts in front-page coverage
of historic moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that people would know the outcome of the vote when
they picked up the paper, so we wanted to do a story that conveyed
the historicity of the moment,'' said Campbell. ``We thought a
writer who could capture the feel of the debate would be in a
position to capture something that would be of value to people the
day after'' they learned about the impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essay built toward the vote,'' explained Campbell, who
said that he and three top editors, two design editors and a photo
editor held a Friday night meeting at which they decided on the
unconventional approach. One of the models for Levins' narrative,
Campbell said, was The New York Herald's coverage of the 1871
search for the explorer Dr. David Livingstone, which built toward
the journalist Henry Morton Stanley's discovery of the doctor in
Africa and his words ``Dr. Livingstone, I presume?''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's Washington bureau chief, Jon Sawyer, who covers
Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, wrote an
interpretive article about the president's ability to govern. This
was published as part of a two-page inside spread of articles,
including four from the Washington bureau.
</P>
<P>
   No other major papers took the route of The Post-Dispatch. But
many editors reached deep into the grab bag of layout strategies to
compose front pages as memorable as the ones that announced
President Kennedy's assassination in 1963, Neil Armstrong's moon
landing in 1969 or President Nixon's resignation in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday Oregonian in Portland offered the single word
``Impeached'' in full capitals as a 2-inch headline, with the full
text of the first article of impeachment in smaller type above it.
A picture of Clinton more than a half-page deep dominated the page,
offset by smaller images of four other people: Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel; Monica Lewinsky; Henry Hyde, the chairman of
the House Judiciary Committee, and Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Herald, The San Diego Union-Tribune, The Las Vegas
Review-Journal/Sun and The Times-Picayune of New Orleans all
featured 1- or 2-inch-high headlines, abutted by smaller boxes
reporting the decision on each of the four articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times, traditionally reserved in the size of its
typefaces, ran the headline ``Clinton Impeached,'' roughly
three-quarters the size of its best-known large headlines, ``Nixon
Resigns'' and ``Men Walk on Moon,'' which were both more than an
inch deep.

FOND YULE MEMORIES OF PIZZA, CHOP SUEY  
 (ADV: RESENDING TO RESTORE TYPE IN LEDE) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY WALKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - We knew we'd hear some great stories when we asked
readers to share their non-traditional Christmas meals. And, we
learned, it all boils down to one thing:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's far more than food,'' Terri Harrington said. ``It's
something you bring to your table and with it go a thousand and one
memories.''
</P>
<P>
   Frozen pizza? Chop suey? Corned beef and cabbage? (begin ital)
Reindeer (end ital) ? Those are just a few untraditional dishes
eaten in the Valley of the Sun, as the Phoenix area is known, as
traditional Christmas meals. We also heard from devoted cooks who
make the ethnic meals that have been in their families for decades,
such as Jack and Linda Yearington of Apache Junction, who are
fourth-generation Bohemian-Americans and whose family has been
serving the same thing for 110 years _ duck with potato dumplings
and sauerkraut, barley with mushrooms, and apricot (begin ital)
kolaches (end ital) for dessert.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, the traditional family-based ethnic meals happen
on Christmas Eve _ which is also the night the animals talk among
themselves, according to a Ukrainian/Polish tradition, so they get
a little something extra for dinner, too, explained Cheryle Wood of
Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Wood keeps the foods and customs she grew up with alive every
year for her family and her father, who just turned 89. The unusual
Christmas borscht that her family loves starts with several cups of
raw oatmeal, buttermilk, lemon juice and a slice of black bread,
fermented for three days, then strained, squeezed through a cloth
until thick, and thinned. Mushrooms and fried onions are added, and
it's served in a bowl with mashed potatoes in the middle. Wood
never has seen a similar recipe or even heard of anyone else who
makes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we always have at least 13 chairs at the table _ one was
for the Christ child _ and you put straw under the tablecloth, to
represent the manger,'' Wood explained.
</P>
<P>
   In Scottsdale, Doris Allen's traditional Czech Catholic/Lutheran
meal starts with communion wafers sandwiched together with honey to
symbolize God's blessings, and a clove of garlic dipped in honey
for good health. Wine, soup, roast beef and Polish sausage, fish,
sardines, lima beans and carrots, and (begin ital) opakansi, (end
ital) small bread rolls steamed with poppy seeds and honey, are the
rest of the meal.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Reichmann of Peoria said that on Christmas Eve, her family
enjoys Lebanese food cooked by her 89-year-old (begin ital) sittie,
(end ital) or grandmother. She makes kibbeh (raw twice-ground meat
mixed with wheat, salt, onion and a little cinnamon, served with
melted butter) and (begin ital) yabra (end ital) - grape or cabbage
leaves stuffed with ground meat, rice, clarified butter and lemon
juice with ground round steak instead of lamb.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this year, Reichmann's (begin ital) sittie (end
ital) fell, so other family members hope she can coach them on the
preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching other family members is crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Conway's 92-year-old Italian grandfather, Fred Bove, makes
the lasagna and meatballs for his family's traditional meal in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``His grandkids help,'' Conway said, adding that there's
something about his hands that make the food special.
</P>
<P>
   In Flagstaff, Stacie Zanzucchi's mother-in-law, Sally, makes
hundreds of homemade ravioli, with meat and meatless, enough to
feed 40 to 50 people. They're on the table with other traditional
foods, Zanzucchi said, but that's what everybody goes for first.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tradition started when the grandfather came to this
country in 1903,'' Zanzucchi said.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband has 10 brothers and a sister scattered around the
country, but they come home every Christmas for homemade ravioli.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought it was funny when they started dispersing around
the country and found not everybody ate ravioli on Christmas Day,''
Zanzucchi said.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people do eat Italian, and readers mentioned meals
centered on lasagna, manicotti, stuffed shells, chicken cacciatore,
and, usually, cannoli for dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Terri Harrington of Mesa centers her Christmas on an Italian
soup called (begin ital) cupelette, (end ital) a recipe her French
grandmother got from her Italian neighbors when she immigrated to a
little town in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be 40 and I've eaten it every year for Christmas Eve
since I was 2,'' Harrington said. ``It's a soup with homemade
noodles formed into ravioli, and inside them is veal, beef and
pork. I feed about 45 on Christmas Eve every year, and it takes
about nine hours to prepare. But my family couldn't have Christmas
without it.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her mom and sisters and daughters have a Saturday ``soup
day'' to make and freeze the soup, which is put together the
morning before Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Sallie Ann Gatty and her mother cook an Italian Christmas Eve
dish, too: Seven different fish cooked seven different ways, and
seven vegetables cooked seven different ways. Her family is in the
seventh generation of doing this. Her cousins in other parts of the
country prepare the same meal.
</P>
<P>
   Gatty's is a dressed-up, formal sit-down dinner, this year for
about 27 people. The menu includes shrimp cocktail; baked clams;
spaghetti with either clam sauce or fish sauce with clams, shrimp
and squid; fried calamari; scallops; fried shrimp; either flounder,
grouper or swordfish; and baby smelts or sardines. When she moved
to the Valley 21 years ago, it was impossible to get all this
stuff, Gatty said, and her mother brought it all from New York in
boxes on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The vegetables include asparagus breaded and fried; cauliflower;
broccoli; stuffed artichokes; stuffed mushrooms; and rapini, an
Italian broccolilike green vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, she adds or subtracts something, Gatty said. Since
moving to Arizona, she's added seviche, a Latin American method of
marinating fish.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas meals are labor-intensive, expensive feasts, and
luxury foods are featured in many of the traditions people have
followed or created.
</P>
<P>
   Prime rib (served in the English tradition, or not) and steaks
fall into this category, as does the beef tenderloin that Karen
Robinson of Scottsdale learned to roast from master chef Walter
Leibel years ago when her sisters worked at the Paradise Valley
Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Darlene DeFranze of north Scottsdale said, ``We have fish on
Christmas Eve, because we were raised Catholic,'' referring to the
traditional fast prohibiting meat before midnight Mass. ``We
usually have lobster gravy _ lobster in a red sauce served over
linguine.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Christmas choices are oyster stew, lobster tails, crab
chowder and crab cakes. They sometimes aren't for religious
reasons: Shirley Lineham of Sun City West said her daughter started
the tradition of baked trout stuffed with crab, shrimp and
mushrooms because they didn't want to eat red meat.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Wilson of Fountain Hills said, ``We have jambalaya with
high-quality seafood. We just got sick of the traditional stuff. We
like seafood. That's about it. My husband tried it one year and we
liked it and we've done it ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hobbses in Mesa have lobster with drawn garlic butter
because it's their favorite food _ she's from New York and he's
from Boston.
</P>
<P>
   American regional food traditions are followed for the same
reasons as ethnic ones: to keep tradition alive.
</P>
<P>
   Marrilyn Nowlan, who lives in Sun City Grand, said everybody in
her family makes beef and homemade noodles for Christmas, which
``wouldn't be unusual back in Indiana.'' Thin egg noodles are
cooked in beef broth and served over mashed potatoes. The meal is
such a family favorite that when Nowlan's mother turned 100 and
relatives from seven states visited, that's what they had to eat.
</P>
<P>
   At Arrowhead Ranch in Glendale, Glenda York makes a meal called
Low Country Boil or Frogmore Stew, traditional in the Beaufort,
S.C., area, where her dad was raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad passed away when my son was 6 months old, and instead
of just talking about him to our son, we wanted a way to bring in
things we had been talking about and make him a real part of his
life,'' York said.
</P>
<P>
   The stew is easy, fun and participatory, York explained, and she
does it for 12 to 30 people, many of whom don't know the other
guests. Weather permitting, the stew is cooked outdoors in a giant
pot over propane. Every 15 minutes, ingredients are added to
boiling water: a spice bag, lemons, Vidalia onions, hot spicy
sausage, new potatoes, shrimp, corn on the cob, and crab, if you
want.
</P>
<P>
   The water is drained off and the food tipped out onto picnic
tables covered with butcher-block paper. The first time, ``some
people kind of stand back, shocked,'' York said. ``But by the time
it's over, everybody can go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   John Betka's chop suey meal started as a joke, when he was
telling his eight siblings a few years ago how he remembered their
mother making chop suey a couple of days before Christmas. None of
the others remembered it. Now, in Scottsdale, he makes it for the
holiday, and he writes fake R.S.V.P. letters from celebrities
declining to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of fun with it,'' Betka said. ``We laugh a lot
and it bonds our family pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Cairns home, Christmas smells like corned beef. The
Cairnses started eating it with cabbage at least 20 years ago in
their Pinetop second home, where they always spent Christmas Eve
skiing at Sunrise. They wanted to watch the kids open gifts,
instead of standing around in the kitchen, and they picked a
favorite meal that cooks itself in one pot.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the kids are long gone, and they have Christmas in Gilbert,
``but we've continued to do the same thing,'' Mary Cairns said.
``And, of course, we have to eat early enough, at 1 or 2 in the
afternoon, so we can have corned beef sandwiches on rye bread in
the evening.''
</P>
<P>
   When Janet Cole of Phoenix was a single parent, money was tight
and she was stressing out when she asked her two kids, then ages 12
and 16, what they wanted for Christmas dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `Mom, we really don't like sitting down to a big
fancy dinner. We don't like to see you knock yourself out, like
Thanksgiving. For Christmas, what we really, really want is pizza.'
They like those cheap frozen pizzas, from the supermarket! So
that's our traditional Christmas frozen pizza,'' Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, the money's better, they're grown, but they still come
over and expect frozen pizza for Christmas. My current husband
says, `OK, frozen pizza.' We open presents and then eat pizza. And
later in the day, stepdad and I have a nice meal.''
</P>
<P>
   Finances had no part in the Seftons' decision to feature
reindeer meat at their holiday meal, because it's very expensive.
They eat a lot of game, and they saw it at a game market and
``thought it sounded like a great Christmas entree,'' Becky Sefton
of Scottsdale explained, laughing a little, because she knows how
it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people say, `Oh, you eat deer.' It's not. It's
reindeer. It's from Alaska.'' And it's farm-raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``When our kids were little, they were morbid about it. They
(begin ital) (end ital) love it.''
</P>
<P>
   They had a Christmas village scene complete with Santa and
sleigh, and they put black hoods on the reindeer. This Christmas,
it's just the two of them, so they've ordered a small roast. But
the kids call to make sure their parents are having reindeer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is year number eight,'' Sefton said, ``so if we're
correct, we're eating Donder this year.'' &QL;

HOW KENNETH STARR BECAME THE INDEPENDENT COUNSEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Who appointed Kenneth Starr as independent counsel?
</P>
<P>
   _ J.J., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: On Aug. 5, 1994, Starr was appointed by a three-judge panel
convened to select a prosecutor for investigations of the executive
branch. He was chosen over Robert Fiske, a special counsel
appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno at a time when the
independent counsel law had lapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Starr previously served as solicitor general during the Bush

an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at Cox News Service,
P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Rev. Robert Drinan, a Roman Catholic priest, has been on
TV often lately expressing his opinion about the Clinton
impeachment proceedings. What is his background?
</P>
<P>
   A: Father Drinan, the first Roman Catholic priest to serve as a
regular voting member of Congress, served in the House as a
Democrat from Massachusetts from 1971 until 1981. He also was the
first congressman to call for Richard Nixon's impeachment, and
served on the House Judiciary committee. Drinan's political career
ended suddenly in 1980 when Vatican officials ruled that such
orders as Jesuits could not exempt their members from the general
prohibition against priests seeking public office. As reported by
the Almanac of American Politics, some people suspected that Pope
John Paul II or Cardinal Humberto Medeiros of Boston wanted Drinan
out of Congress because of his refusal to support right-to-life
measures.
</P>
<P>
   Drinan was born in Boston on Nov. 15, 1920. He entered the
Society of Jesus in 1942 and was ordained as a Jesuit priest in
1953. He received a law degree from Georgetown University in 1949
and was assistant dean, then dean, of the Boston College Law School
from 1955 to 1970. After leaving Congress, he joined the staff at
Georgetown University's Law Center, where he continues to teach.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is a videotape version of the old World War II movie ``The
Fighting Sullivans'' available anywhere for rental or purchase?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you can't find it at video stores, try calling Blockbuster
Entertainment's customer service center, 1-800-800-6767.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Author Stephen E. Ambrose suffered a serious fall recently
and was listed in poor condition. I didn't see any follow-up. What
is his condition?
</P>
<P>
   A: At last report, the best-selling historian was undergoing
physical therapy after suffering a concussion and spending more
than a week recovering in a hospital. The accident happened in
early November when Ambrose fell in Madison, Wis., hitting his head
on a marble floor. His son, Hugh Ambrose, who acts as his father's
agent and research assistant, said tests had ruled out a stroke,
aneurism and ``anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear when the 62-year-old author would resume giving
speeches and doing interviews. Hugh Ambrose stressed that his
father is in good spirits, goes on walks and is still writing.
Stephen Ambrose is the author of biographies of Presidents Dwight
Eisenhower and Richard Nixon and several World War II books, among
other subjects. He also was chief historical adviser for the Steven
Spielberg movie ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article about chewing gums that may help fight decay
mentioned a sweetener used overseas as a cavity fighter. I've never
heard of such a thing. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: The dental gums, which first were available overseas, started
to appear on U.S. store shelves this fall. All use xylitol, a
natural sweetener also found in Procter &AMP; Gamble's Crest MultiCare
toothpaste. Xylitol is touted in Europe and Asia as a cavity
fighter, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration didn't
immediately permit marketers to make the claim in the United
States, according to The Wall Street Journal. Sugarless gums, which
have been on the market for more than a decade, can reduce plaque
by 8 percent to 10 percent, gum makers say. The new dental gums
claim to cut plaque by up to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When it was reported that one of the parties in the Roe v.
Wade suit on abortion had changed her stance and was working
against abortion, it also was reported that she wasn't likely to
stick to her decision. What's the upshot of that?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was in August 1995 when Norma McCorvey, known as ``Jane
Roe'' in the landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion
nationwide, did her about-face and joined abortion foes. When she
resigned as marketing director of A Choice for Women in Dallas, a
women's clinic often targeted by abortion protesters, she said she
had grown dissatisfied with an undue emphasis on abortion at the
clinic. She said she had received Jesus Christ and joined the
Evangelical Protestants, and was baptized before national TV
cameras and the Rev. Philip Benham, national leader of Operation
Rescue.
</P>
<P>
   In an article published in October, The (Newark, N.J.)
Star-Ledger reported that ``now, three years later, the Christian
and the anti-abortion commitments have stuck.'' But at age 51, the
newspaper added, McCorvey has left Operation Rescue and has changed
faith to Catholicism, ``this time without hoopla.'' McCorvey told a
reporter that she has cut down to two packs of cigarettes ``on a
good day'' and is free of cocaine and alcohol addictions. She
continues to share a house with friend Connie Gonzalez, but said
it's now a platonic relationship, and she believes same-sex
behavior is wrong. And her anti-abortion stance is firm: ``I'm 100
percent pro-life. I don't believe in abortion even in an extreme
situation. . . . You're not to act as your own God.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Millions of us drink bottled water or home-filtered water
instead of tap water. Both processes remove fluoride, which our
dentists tell us we need. How can we add it back?
</P>
<P>
   A: It can't be added back, said food and nutrition expert Chris
Rosenbloom, a professor at Georgia State University and spokeswoman
for the American Dietetic Association. She applauds you, by the
way, for recognizing that bottled water doesn't have fluoride,
because many consumers apparently are unaware of it. If there are
children in your household, Rosenbloom recommends talking with your
dentist so the dentist can prescribe fluoride supplements. It's
important to consult a dentist, she warned, because excessive
fluoride can cause problems such as mottling the teeth. Even adults
should consult their dentist about fluoride, she added, but they
can safely use toothpaste and mouthwash with fluoride if they wish.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you're in City A and a highway sign says 135 miles to City
B, does that mean it's 135 miles from that point to city limit of
City B, or to the first exit in City B, or to the city center?
</P>
<P>
   A: Interstate highway signs indicate mileage from the point
where the sign is to the city center. Since no city is built in a
perfect circle, the point would not be the exact geographical
center. Rather, the defining point would be the location of the
central business district in that city.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Now that bombing has begun again in Iraq, how can we send
mail to U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf and elsewhere?
</P>
<P>
   A: The ``anonymous mail program,'' in which letters are sent to
``any service member,'' doesn't guarantee that the recipient will
be in the Gulf region, said Capt. Edward Haggerty of the Military
Postal Service Agency in Alexandria, Va. But you can designate
areas of the world to which you want to direct the letters or
postcards.
</P>
<P>
   There are two programs, one year-round for people in Bosnia, and
the other, for troops worldwide, operating through Jan. 15 only.
Because of the threat of terrorism, packages no longer can be sent,
Haggerty said. Both programs are restricted to first-class mail
weighing no more than 11 ounces. These are the addresses:
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia: Any Service Member, Operation Joint Forge, APO AE
09397-0001
</P>
<P>
   Europe and Southwest Asia: America Remembers, Operation Dear
Abby, APO AE 09135

</P>
<P>
   Pacific Basin: America Remembers, Operation Dear Abby, FPO AP

</P>
<P>
   Q: I told some friends that if President Clinton resigns, he
gets his pension for the rest of his life. But if he's impeached,
he loses it. Will you verify that?
</P>
<P>
   A: As Q&AMP;A has noted before, Clinton will be eligible for a
pension if he resigns. But if he is impeached and convicted by
Congress, he forfeits the pension as well as his office allowances,
which can be as much as $650,000 a year, said Pete Sepp of the
National Taxpayers Union in Alexandria, Va. If Clinton is impeached
by the House but the Senate does not vote to convict and remove him
from office, he keeps his pension and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The pension Clinton is entitled to is $151,800 a year. By law,
it would increase any time the salary for a Cabinet-level officer
increases, Sepp said. The National Taxpayers Union estimates that
if Clinton lives to the normal life expectancy of a man his age, he
would collect $6.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I get more information from the Humane Society of the
United States about its investigation into the use of dogs and cats
for fur coats?
</P>
<P>
   A: Call the Humane Society's hotline, 301-548-7799, and leave
your name and address for information to be mailed to you. Or
write: Humane Society of the United States, 2100 L. St. NW,
Washington, DC 20037. And for online information, check the Humane
Society's Web site _ http://www.hsus.org _ and click on Press
Releases. Then go to Dec. 15, 1998, Betrayal of Trust: A Special
Investigation Into the Global Trade of Dog and Cat Fur.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you provide an update on actress Margot Kidder?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 50-year-old Kidder, who played Lois Lane in the four
``Superman'' movies, among many other film, TV and stage roles
dating to 1969, is staying busy. As the whole world knows, in April
1996 the actress was found dazed and confused in Glendale, Calif.,
after being missing for several days. The diagnosis for what she
terms ``the most public freak-out in history'' was bipolar
disorder, or manic depression, which at last report was being
treated successfully.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Los Angeles Times in November 1997,
Kidder talked about her varied current and future projects, which
included playing flamboyant chain-smoking drama teacher Cookie De
Varen on the TV sitcom ``Boston Common''; a dog in ``Sylvia'' on
stage to Toronto; a new-age guru in a film shot in Fiji; and a
police officer in ``Silent Cradle,'' shot in Alberta. She also
portrayed painter Georgia O'Keeffe in the two-person touring play
``Stieglitz Loves O'Keeffe (with Stacey Keach) and a music teacher
in the independent feature ``The Planet of Junior Brown.'' When she
isn't working, Kidder lives in Montana.

52% OF ARIZONANS OPPOSE REMOVING CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Most Arizonans do not believe the Senate should force
President Clinton from office, but they do think he should be
punished for his behavior in the Monica Lewinsky scandal, according
to a new Arizona Republic Poll.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found Clinton continues to enjoy strong public
support in Arizona, even after his impeachment by the House and
four days of military strikes against Iraq by U.S. and British
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-two percent of those surveyed said they approved of the
job Clinton is doing as president, nearly unchanged from the 63
percent rating he received in November. Those are his highest
ratings in The Republic Poll since March of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   An even larger number, 73 percent, said in the weekend poll that
they approved of the strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The statewide poll of 411 voters was taken over the weekend _
shortly after Clinton was impeached by the House on Saturday. It
has an error margin of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that 52 percent of Arizonans were opposed to
Clinton's removal by the Senate. Forty-one percent supported his
ouster, and 7 percent had no opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Among those not supporting Clinton's removal, 76 percent said
they would back a bill to censure and fine Clinton for his role in
the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also suggests Arizonans are highly ambivalent about
Clinton's impeachment: Forty-eight percent approved of the House
vote, while an equal number opposed it. Four percent had no
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like he needs to be punished for lying under oath, but
I don't necessarily think that impeachment is the best thing for
the country,'' said Rita Buffard of Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Republican, but for the most part, I think he's done an
OK job as president.''
</P>
<P>
   Those Arizonans surveyed were asked, ``Do you approve or
disapprove of the way Bill Clinton is handling his job as
president?''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Slezak of Litchfield Park had a blunt response, calling
Clinton ``somewhat of a tramp, and I just don't respect him.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Senate should give Clinton the boot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent almost 30 years in the service, and for any one of my
officers to set an example the way he did, I'd have their (rear),''
said Slezak, a retired Air Force colonel and a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the survey showed the public is highly critical of
Clinton's conduct in the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether they believed Clinton lied about having
sexual relations with a young intern, 85 percent of those polled
said yes. Only 7 percent said no.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most of those surveyed had little interest in seeing
Clinton's presidency come to an early end.
</P>
<P>
   Most, 53 percent, do not think Clinton should resign, while 44
percent said he should step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``His wife is the one who should approve or disapprove of this,
not me or anybody else in the country,'' said Eileen Santello of
Paradise Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any other man who has done this has probably lied,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   Those hungry for Clinton's ouster are equally outspoken.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the most dangerous people we've ever had in
office,'' said Jennifer Edmondson of Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be nice to get him out of office.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the poll's findings of deep public distrust of Clinton,
most Arizonans do not think the attack on Iraq was politically
motivated.
</P>
<P>
   According to the survey, 57 percent agreed with Clinton's
contention that it was in the best interest of the country to
strike, while 28 percent agreed with critics' view that it was
launched to delay the House vote on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Nine percent agreed with both statements, while 6 percent had no
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll found that most Arizonans are also unhappy with the
way independent counsel Kenneth Starr handled his investigation
into the president's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   A solid majority, 55 percent, disapproved of Starr's handling of
the investigation, compared with 39 percent who approved his
methods. The remainder had no opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also suggests that the political futures of Arizona
Republican Sens. John McCain and Jon Kyl could be affected by the
way they vote in a Senate impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is studying a 2000 presidential bid, while Kyl faces
re-election in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six percent said they would be less inclined to vote for
McCain for president if he supports Clinton's ouster, while 28
percent said they would be more inclined to support his
presidential bid if he votes against the president. Twenty-five
percent said McCain's vote would have no effect. Eleven percent
didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   In Kyl's case, 38 percent of those polled said they would be
less inclined to support his re-election bid if he votes to oust
Clinton. Thirty percent said they would be more inclined to support
Kyl if he opposes Clinton, while 22 percent said Kyl's vote would
have no effect on their attitude toward the senator. Ten percent
didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to Arizona's House members, 40 percent of those
surveyed said they would be less inclined to support their
congressman if he had voted to impeach Clinton. All five of
Arizona's House Republicans voted to impeach Clinton, while
Democrat Ed Pastor sided with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-three percent said they would be more inclined to vote
for their representative if he voted for impeachment, while 21
percent said the vote would have no impact on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   In other results, 45 percent said they believe Clinton's
impeachment will lead to more attempts to impeach a president in
the future. Twenty-four percent said it would lead to fewer
impeachment votes, while 31 percent said it would have no effect. &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The world is now digesting the grave consequences of the use of
force by the United States and Great Britain against Iraq. By
arrogating to itself the functions of prosecutor, judge and court
marshal, the United States has dealt a heavy blow to the United
Nations _ and to the hopes of establishing a just and effective
international legal order.
</P>
<P>
   One theme is prominent in Russian comments on the U.S. air
strikes: Russia has been snubbed; its opinion was simply ignored.
Many politicians, even such serious ones as Moscow's Mayor Yuri
Luzhkov, are now saying that as a response to this show of power,
Russia should be rebuilding its own economic, political and
military might.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, by using military force, Washington was not defying
just Russia alone. In the same way, the United States dismissed
curtly the viewpoints of other nations too _ including China,
India, France, Italy and the League of Arab States, all of whom
subsequently objected strongly to the bombing raids. The reaction
in Russia, at this time, is symptomatic. It follows naturally from
what has happened to the country in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   By now, with the close of 1998, the failure of Boris Yeltsin's
political and economic course has been laid bare. One crisis after
another this past year has dramatized the consequences of his
misguided policies. The financial collapse that started last August
has hit even those people _ the 10 percent to 15 percent of the
population _ who actually had benefited from the ``reforms.'' As
for the majority of Russian citizens, even Yeltsin himself has had
to admit that, yes, they live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   And yet these pseudo-reforms, which have done great harm to
Russia's economy, to its health and education systems, to its
science and culture, were applauded by the West. There was pro-U.S.
euphoria in Russia at one point; but today this has given way to
anti-American sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   More and more of our people are wondering: ``Why does the United
States so much like the policies that are so bad for us?''
</P>
<P>
   All too often, Washington's reactions are just wrong. When, for
example, the failure of Russia's previous governments forced yet
another change and the appointment of the cabinet of Yevgeny
Primakov, Washington's response was not right. By freezing the
loans promised to the previous Russian cabinet, the International
Monetary Fund followed suit and made things even more difficult _
all of this at a time when Primakov is desperately trying to
stabilize the situation.
</P>
<P>
   In the West and in the Russian media, his cabinet is often
called pro-Communist and anti-reform. As I have said time and again
_ both in Russia and during a recent lecture tour around the United
States _ this is far from the truth. In fact, the new Russian
cabinet is made of pragmatic, no-nonsense people, with a great deal
of experience. Its leaders are far from being fly-by-night
trend-setters; they are not fooling around. They are wise men who
are concerned about the country's future and understand that there
can be no return to the past.
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely this kind of cabinet that gives Russia a chance
to gradually extricate itself from a post-Cold War crisis that dims
the bright future we envisioned just a short time ago. It is
Primakov's kind of cabinet that will give this country a chance to
integrate into the global economy and establish long-term
cooperation with the West.
</P>
<P>
   Of course we are not going to simply jump on the bandwagon and
support without reservation whatever the United States might do,
nor should the rest of the world expect such thoughtless
endorsement. With a cabinet like Primakov's, Russia is an honest
and reliable partner with which other leaders and nations can deal.
</P>
<P>
   I have no doubt that, but for the U.S. attack against Iraq, the
Primakov government would have secured the Russian parliament's
ratification of the START II treaty. It has collected dust in the
Duma since 1993; after promising work by Primakov, the talks were
likely to resume. Some opponents were won over. The limits of 6,000
warheads under START I would be cut in half. Now, after the battle
was fought, it must be fought again. After what has happened, this
will be an uphill task. Once again, resentment has built up and is
cresting thanks to this aggressive bombing. As it is, one aide to
President Yeltsin has already stated carelessly that ``one may well
give up'' on the arms-control treaty.
</P>
<P>
   How disappointing on the eve of the new century, when peace and
diplomacy are still the right road.
</P>
<P>
   On this issue, as on many others, the Russian cabinet has to
contend with interference from all kinds of quarters. What is
needed is something quite different _ to help this government and
thus help Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Americans often ask me: Why should we help Russia? Often the
question is posed sincerely and in good faith. But other times one
detects the barely submerged tone of a self-proclaimed ``victor''
in the Cold War. There is no victor; I believe it is plain that
moving into the 21st century, we all must stand together.
</P>
<P>
   I think that the illusion of America's omnipotence, now so
common among U.S. politicians, will one day vanish and it will
become clear that in today's boundaryless world NO ONE can have a
monopoly on leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as the bombs rained on Iraq and shortly thereafter, new
centers of economic power and political influence were continuing
to emerge. Alliances may shift; Russia could become a strong and
friendly partner to the West. But today many people regard such a
prospect as highly unlikely, and recent U.S. actions have not
brought it any closer.
</P>
<P>
   It will take a major effort by both sides in the coming year to
put things back on course.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The world is now digesting the grave consequences of the use of
force by the United States and Great Britain against Iraq. By
arrogating to itself the functions of prosecutor, judge and court
marshal, the United States has dealt a heavy blow to the United
Nations _ and to the hopes of establishing a just and effective
international legal order.
</P>
<P>
   One theme is prominent in Russian comments on the U.S. air
strikes: Russia has been snubbed; its opinion was simply ignored.
Many politicians, even such serious ones as Moscow's Mayor Yuri
Luzhkov, are now saying that as a response to this show of power,
Russia should be rebuilding its own economic, political and
military might.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, by using military force, Washington was not defying
just Russia alone. In the same way, the United States dismissed
curtly the viewpoints of other nations too _ including China,
India, France, Italy and the League of Arab States, all of whom
subsequently objected strongly to the bombing raids. The reaction
in Russia, at this time, is symptomatic. It follows naturally from
what has happened to the country in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   By now, with the close of 1998, the failure of Boris Yeltsin's
political and economic course has been laid bare. One crisis after
another this past year has dramatized the consequences of his
misguided policies. The financial collapse that started last August
has hit even those people _ the 10 percent to 15 percent of the
population _ who actually had benefited from the ``reforms.'' As
for the majority of Russian citizens, even Yeltsin himself has had
to admit that, yes, they live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   And yet these pseudo-reforms, which have done great harm to
Russia's economy, to its health and education systems, to its
science and culture, were applauded by the West. There was pro-U.S.
euphoria in Russia at one point; but today this has given way to
anti-American sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   More and more of our people are wondering: ``Why does the United
States so much like the policies that are so bad for us?''
</P>
<P>
   All too often, Washington's reactions are just wrong. When, for
example, the failure of Russia's previous governments forced yet
another change and the appointment of the cabinet of Yevgeny
Primakov, Washington's response was not right. By freezing the
loans promised to the previous Russian cabinet, the International
Monetary Fund followed suit and made things even more difficult _
all of this at a time when Primakov is desperately trying to
stabilize the situation.
</P>
<P>
   In the West and in the Russian media, his cabinet is often
called pro-Communist and anti-reform. As I have said time and again
_ both in Russia and during a recent lecture tour around the United
States _ this is far from the truth. In fact, the new Russian
cabinet is made of pragmatic, no-nonsense people, with a great deal
of experience. Its leaders are far from being fly-by-night
trend-setters; they are not fooling around. They are wise men who
are concerned about the country's future and understand that there
can be no return to the past.
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely this kind of cabinet that gives Russia a chance
to gradually extricate itself from a post-Cold War crisis that dims
the bright future we envisioned just a short time ago. It is
Primakov's kind of cabinet that will give this country a chance to
integrate into the global economy and establish long-term
cooperation with the West.
</P>
<P>
   Of course we are not going to simply jump on the bandwagon and
support without reservation whatever the United States might do,
nor should the rest of the world expect such thoughtless
endorsement. With a cabinet like Primakov's, Russia is an honest
and reliable partner with which other leaders and nations can deal.
</P>
<P>
   I have no doubt that, but for the U.S. attack against Iraq, the
Primakov government would have secured the Russian parliament's
ratification of the START II treaty. It has collected dust in the
Duma since 1993; after promising work by Primakov, the talks were
likely to resume. Some opponents were won over. The limits of 6,000
warheads under START I would be cut in half. Now, after the battle

will be an uphill task. Once again, resentment has built up and is

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: CNN's Wolf Blitzer absolutely owns TV reporting from
Washington, never more so than during the Clinton impeachment
proceedings. What is Blitzer's educational and professional
background?
</P>
<P>
   A: He has a bachelor of arts in history from the State
University of New York at Buffalo, and a master of arts in
international relations from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced
International Studies in Washington. He also has several honorary
doctoral degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Blitzer began his career in 1972 with news agency Reuters. He
joined CNN in 1990, serving as its military affairs correspondent
at the Pentagon from 1990 to 1992. Now CNN's senior White House
correspondent and host of ``Late Edition,'' he is the author of two
books, ``Between Washington and Jerusalem: A Reporter's Notebook''
and ``Territory of Lies'' (about the case of Jonathan Pollard,
former U.S. Navy intelligence analyst convicted of spying for
Israel in the mid-1980s).
</P>
<P>
   Q: If the Clinton impeachment case goes to the Senate for trial,
Chief Justice William Rehnquist will preside. Was the president who
appointed him to the Supreme Court a Democrat or a Republican?
</P>
<P>
   A: Rehnquist was appointed to the Supreme Court by Republican
President Richard Nixon in 1971, and was elevated to chief justice
by Republican President Ronald Reagan in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did any of the cockpit crew survive the recent crash of the
Airbus in Thailand? I saw no mention in news reports.
</P>
<P>
   A: The pilot of the A310-200, identified by Thai Airways as
Pinit Wechsilpa, died of his injuries after the Dec. 11 crash in a
swamp near Surat Thani, 330 miles southwest of Bangkok. The fates
of the other cockpit personnel have not been released. At least one
flight attendant survived. The death toll stands at 101, with 45
survivors. Thai Airways said Wechsilpa was ``well-trained'' and had
12 years of experience before being made a pilot earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has Atlanta ever had a white Christmas?
</P>
<P>
   A: While snow flurries have fallen in Atlanta on Christmas Day
nine times since record-keeping began in 1878, there has never been
an accumulation, according to the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What exactly is the ``Christmas portion'' of Handel's
``Messiah''? I've heard the Hallelujah chorus at Christmas and at
Easter.
</P>
<P>
   A: Composer George Frideric Handel divided his great oratorio
``Messiah'' into three parts, explains Nick Jones, program
editor/annotator of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. Part 1tells the
Christmas story, from the ancient prophesies of the savior's coming
to the midnight appearance of a band of angels to announce the holy
birth to a group of shepherds. Part 2 deals with the powerful story
of the Passion, the events from Christ's triumphal entrance into
Jerusalem on Palm Sunday through his death and resurrection. It
ends with the mighty Hallelujah chorus. Part 3, the shortest
portion, has to do with Christ's ascension and the spreading of the
wondrous story to all people. Parts 2 and 3, therefore, relate
closely to Easter.
</P>
<P>
   Handel composed his oratorios for performance during Lent, when
London's theaters were not allowed to present staged productions.
``Messiah,'' first presented during the year he spent in Dublin,
Ireland, was premiered April 13, 1742. But even during Handel's
lifetime, the work began to be associated with the Christmas
season.
</P>
<P>
   The entire oratorio lasts nearly 2 1/2 hours, not including any
intermission, so for Christmastime performances many musical
organizations present the Christmas story contained in Part 1. Long
ago it became customary to add to this the Hallelujah chorus.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Doesn't Joe DiMaggio have a son? I've seen no mention of him
in newspaper articles or on TV.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, he has a son, born to Joe and his first wife, actress
Dorothy Arnold. But Joe Jr. avoids the public eye. He is rarely
mentioned in articles and books about his famous dad. In the early
'50s, the son was in military school. After that, he apparently
dropped out. In October 1989, Life reported that Joe Jr., then 47,
was a truck driver living east of San Francisco without a
telephone. He was quoted as saying: ``My lifestyle is diametrically
opposed to my father's. I'm not much more than a hobo.'' Joe Jr.
has two daughters, Paula and Kathie, who live in the San Francisco
Bay Area. When Joe DiMaggio's second wife, Marilyn Monroe, died in
1962, the son was photographed with his father at the Los Angeles
mortuary where the actress was taken. Other than that, he has been
about as reclusive as a person can be.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that there's a mention of the ``great speckled
bird'' in the Bible. Do you know where?
</P>
<P>
   A: It comes from a passage in the 12th chapter of the Book of
Jeremiah, in which God laments, ``Mine heritage is unto me as a
speckled bird, the birds round about are against her; come ye,
assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the current Congress, House Republicans outnumber
Democrats 228-206. The House Judiciary Committee is composed of 21
Republicans and 16 Democrats. If committees are supposed to reflect
the exact ratio as the House itself, why aren't there more
Democrats?
</P>
<P>
   A: The standing rules of both the Senate and House are silent on
the matter of party ratios on committees. By tradition, the Senate
has more or less followed the practice of filling standing
committees according to the strength of each party in the chamber.
The House has been less inclined to allocate minority party
representation on committees on the basis of relative strength of
the two parties.
</P>
<P>
   This has caused some problems, according to Congressional
Quarterly's Guide to Congress. When the Democrats were the majority
party, they felt little need to accommodate their political
opposition on important committees. In 1981, Republicans filed a
lawsuit to change the party ratios on four key committees. The case
was dismissed, but in 1985 Democratic leaders agreed to give
Republicans more seats on most major committees. In the case of the
current House Judiciary Committee, staffer Michelle Morgan said the
chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.), has ``made an effort to be
fair'' in the number of Democrats involved.
</P>
<P>
   Q: About the numbering of Interstate highways: Isn't it true
that the even numbers are tied to their relative geographic
position, for example, I-10 has roughly 10 percent of the United
States below it?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's not exactly the way the Federal Highway Administration
puts it. For north-south routes, the lowest numbers simply begin in
the West, said the FHA's Richard Weingroff, while the lowest
numbered east-west routes are in the South. By this method, I-5
runs along the West Coast, while I-10 lies along the southern
border. He attached no land area or population significance to the
numbering system.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent newspaper article described a garden as ``certified
as a National Wildlife Federation backyard habitat.'' What does
that mean? How can other people apply to get their gardens so
certified?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Backyard Wildlife Habitat program was begun in 1973 to
acknowledge and encourage individuals who plan their landscape with
the needs of wildlife in mind. The program is simply a way to
acknowledge those efforts with a national certification program.
The federation says homeowners, schools, businesses and community
groups can take part by using plants that provide seeds, fruits and
nuts for birds and small mammals; providing birdbaths, small ponds
or shallow water dishes for birds, dragonflies, newts and frogs;
planting evergreen trees and shrubs to provide year-round
protective cover from weather and predators; and providing nesting
places for the raising of young.
</P>
<P>
   Habitat Information Kits can be purchased by sending $12.95
(check made payable to National Wildlife Federation) to: NWF,
Backyard Wildlife Habitat Program, 8925 Leesburg Place, Vienna, VA
22184-0001.

</P>
<P>
   Q: The Rev. Robert Drinan, a Roman Catholic priest, has been on
TV often lately expressing his opinion about the Clinton
impeachment proceedings. What is his background?
</P>
<P>
   A: Father Drinan, the first Roman Catholic priest to serve as a
regular voting member of Congress, served in the House as a
Democrat from Massachusetts from 1971 until 1981. He also was the
first congressman to call for Richard Nixon's impeachment, and
served on the House Judiciary committee. Drinan's political career
ended suddenly in 1980 when Vatican officials ruled that such
orders as Jesuits could not exempt their members from the general
prohibition against priests seeking public office. As reported by
the Almanac of American Politics, some people suspected that Pope
John Paul II or Cardinal Humberto Medeiros of Boston wanted Drinan
out of Congress because of his refusal to support right-to-life
measures.
</P>
<P>
   Drinan was born in Boston on Nov. 15, 1920. He entered the
Society of Jesus in 1942 and was ordained as a Jesuit priest in
1953. He received a law degree from Georgetown University in 1949
and was assistant dean, then dean, of the Boston College Law School
from 1955 to 1970. After leaving Congress, he joined the staff at
Georgetown University's Law Center, where he continues to teach.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is a videotape version of the old World War II movie ``The
Fighting Sullivans'' available anywhere for rental or purchase?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you can't find it at video stores, try calling Blockbuster
Entertainment's customer service center, 1-800-800-6767.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Author Stephen E. Ambrose suffered a serious fall recently
and was listed in poor condition. I didn't see any follow-up. What
is his condition?
</P>
<P>
   A: At last report, the best-selling historian was undergoing
physical therapy after suffering a concussion and spending more
than a week recovering in a hospital. The accident happened in
early November when Ambrose fell in Madison, Wis., hitting his head
on a marble floor. His son, Hugh Ambrose, who acts as his father's
agent and research assistant, said tests had ruled out a stroke,
aneurism and ``anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear when the 62-year-old author would resume giving
speeches and doing interviews. Hugh Ambrose stressed that his
father is in good spirits, goes on walks and is still writing.
Stephen Ambrose is the author of biographies of Presidents Dwight
Eisenhower and Richard Nixon and several World War II books, among
other subjects. He also was chief historical adviser for the Steven
Spielberg movie ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article about chewing gums that may help fight decay
mentioned a sweetener used overseas as a cavity fighter. I've never
heard of such a thing. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: The dental gums, which first were available overseas, started
to appear on U.S. store shelves this fall. All use xylitol, a
natural sweetener also found in Procter &AMP; Gamble's Crest MultiCare
toothpaste. Xylitol is touted in Europe and Asia as a cavity
fighter, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration didn't
immediately permit marketers to make the claim in the United
States, according to The Wall Street Journal. Sugarless gums, which
have been on the market for more than a decade, can reduce plaque
by 8 percent to 10 percent, gum makers say. The new dental gums
claim to cut plaque by up to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When it was reported that one of the parties in the Roe v.
Wade suit on abortion had changed her stance and was working
against abortion, it also was reported that she wasn't likely to
stick to her decision. What's the upshot of that?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was in August 1995 when Norma McCorvey, known as ``Jane
Roe'' in the landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion
nationwide, did her about-face and joined abortion foes. When she
resigned as marketing director of A Choice for Women in Dallas, a
women's clinic often targeted by abortion protesters, she said she
had grown dissatisfied with an undue emphasis on abortion at the
clinic. She said she had received Jesus Christ and joined the
Evangelical Protestants, and was baptized before national TV
cameras and the Rev. Philip Benham, national leader of Operation
Rescue.
</P>
<P>
   In an article published in October, The (Newark, N.J.)
Star-Ledger reported that ``now, three years later, the Christian
and the anti-abortion commitments have stuck.'' But at age 51, the
newspaper added, McCorvey has left Operation Rescue and has changed
faith to Catholicism, ``this time without hoopla.'' McCorvey told a
reporter that she has cut down to two packs of cigarettes ``on a
good day'' and is free of cocaine and alcohol addictions. She
continues to share a house with friend Connie Gonzalez, but said
it's now a platonic relationship, and she believes same-sex
behavior is wrong. And her anti-abortion stance is firm: ``I'm 100
percent pro-life. I don't believe in abortion even in an extreme
situation. . . . You're not to act as your own God.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Millions of us drink bottled water or home-filtered water
instead of tap water. Both processes remove fluoride, which our
dentists tell us we need. How can we add it back?
</P>
<P>
   A: It can't be added back, said food and nutrition expert Chris
Rosenbloom, a professor at Georgia State University and spokeswoman
for the American Dietetic Association. She applauds you, by the
way, for recognizing that bottled water doesn't have fluoride,
because many consumers apparently are unaware of it. If there are
children in your household, Rosenbloom recommends talking with your
dentist so the dentist can prescribe fluoride supplements. It's
important to consult a dentist, she warned, because excessive
fluoride can cause problems such as mottling the teeth. Even adults
should consult their dentist about fluoride, she added, but they
can safely use toothpaste and mouthwash with fluoride if they wish.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you're in City A and a highway sign says 135 miles to City
B, does that mean it's 135 miles from that point to city limit of
City B, or to the first exit in City B, or to the city center?
</P>
<P>
   A: Interstate highway signs indicate mileage from the point
where the sign is to the city center. Since no city is built in a
perfect circle, the point would not be the exact geographical
center. Rather, the defining point would be the location of the
central business district in that city.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Now that bombing has begun again in Iraq, how can we send
mail to U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf and elsewhere?
</P>
<P>
   A: The ``anonymous mail program,'' in which letters are sent to
``any service member,'' doesn't guarantee that the recipient will
be in the Gulf region, said Capt. Edward Haggerty of the Military
Postal Service Agency in Alexandria, Va. But you can designate
areas of the world to which you want to direct the letters or
postcards.
</P>
<P>
   There are two programs, one year-round for people in Bosnia, and
the other, for troops worldwide, operating through Jan. 15 only.
Because of the threat of terrorism, packages no longer can be sent,
Haggerty said. Both programs are restricted to first-class mail
weighing no more than 11 ounces. These are the addresses:

   Q: I told some friends that if President Clinton resigns, he
gets his pension for the rest of his life. But if he's impeached,
he loses it. Will you verify that?
</P>
<P>
   A: As Q&AMP;A has noted before, Clinton will be eligible for a
pension if he resigns. But if he is impeached and convicted by
Congress, he forfeits the pension as well as his office allowances,
which can be as much as $650,000 a year, said Pete Sepp of the
National Taxpayers Union in Alexandria, Va. If Clinton is impeached
by the House but the Senate does not vote to convict and remove him
from office, he keeps his pension and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The pension Clinton is entitled to is $151,800 a year. By law,
it would increase any time the salary for a Cabinet-level officer
increases, Sepp said. The National Taxpayers Union estimates that
if Clinton lives to the normal life expectancy of a man his age, he
would collect $6.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I get more information from the Humane Society of the
United States about its investigation into the use of dogs and cats
for fur coats?
</P>
<P>
   A: Call the Humane Society's hotline, 301-548-7799, and leave
your name and address for information to be mailed to you. Or
write: Humane Society of the United States, 2100 L. St. NW,
Washington, DC 20037. And for online information, check the Humane
Society's Web site _ http://www.hsus.org _ and click on Press
Releases. Then go to Dec. 15, 1998, Betrayal of Trust: A Special
Investigation Into the Global Trade of Dog and Cat Fur.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you provide an update on actress Margot Kidder?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 50-year-old Kidder, who played Lois Lane in the four
``Superman'' movies, among many other film, TV and stage roles
dating to 1969, is staying busy. As the whole world knows, in April
1996 the actress was found dazed and confused in Glendale, Calif.,
after being missing for several days. The diagnosis for what she
terms ``the most public freak-out in history'' was bipolar
disorder, or manic depression, which at last report was being
treated successfully.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Los Angeles Times in November 1997,
Kidder talked about her varied current and future projects, which
included playing flamboyant chain-smoking drama teacher Cookie De
Varen on the TV sitcom ``Boston Common''; a dog in ``Sylvia'' on
stage to Toronto; a new-age guru in a film shot in Fiji; and a
police officer in ``Silent Cradle,'' shot in Alberta. She also
portrayed painter Georgia O'Keeffe in the two-person touring play
``Stieglitz Loves O'Keeffe (with Stacey Keach) and a music teacher
in the independent feature ``The Planet of Junior Brown.'' When she
isn't working, Kidder lives in Montana.

CIVILACTION-MOVIE _ John Travolta, etc., on true story turned into
best-selling book and then movie ``A Civil Action.'' The 110-minute
movie is a rather faithful adaptation of Jonathan Harr's complex
500-page work, not the easiest of tasks when you consider Harr's
estimate that it takes most people 30 hours to read the book. By
Glenn Whipp. 
. 
THINRED-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ Can beauty and ugliness be the
workings of one mind, the features of the same face? That's the
question at the heart of Terrence Malick's visually stunning ``The
Thin Red Line,'' a movie that mixes philosophical ruminations,
heart-pounding battle sequences and idyllic visions of nature into
a thoughtful, though sometimes meandering mix of abstractions that
somehow manage to add up to a beautifully lyrical cinematic epic. 3
stars. By Glenn Whipp. 
. 
FLIGHT-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ ``The Theory of Flight'' may be many
things _ uneven, funny, confounding, disarming _ but it is as far
from typical disease movie fare as you can get and still have the
lead character in a wheelchair and struggling with a speech
impediment. Its story can be slight and somewhat obvious at times,
but this rather unconventional romantic comedy has enough
surprises, along with another bravura performance from actress
Helena Bonham Carter, to make for an engaging moviegoing
experience. 3 Star. By Glenn Whipp. 
. 
GENERAL-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ Truth is stranger than pulp fiction
in ``The General,'' John Boorman's enthralling, magnificent look at
real-life Irish crime lord Martin Cahill. With a one-of-a-kind,
force-of-nature performance by Brendan Gleeson, filmed in luminous,
wide-screen black and white because Boorman just wanted to, ``The
General'' is simultaneously a great caper film, a smart and radical
social satire and the most compelling character study you'll see
this season. 4 stars. By Bob Strauss.

AIRSTRIKES END, SADDAM WINS AGAIN  
 (ADV: THIS EDITORIAL APPEARED IN THE DEC. 22 ARIZONA REPUBLIC) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - This past weekend, two embattled presidents stood on
opposite sides of the world, each proclaiming victory. As the dust
cleared and people began sorting through the rubble in Washington,
D.C., and Baghdad, it was Saddam Hussein, not Bill Clinton, who
could stake the better claim to victory.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who on Saturday halted the waves of airstrikes on Iraq,
said the 70-hour assault had severely damaged Saddam's ability to
build weapons of mass destruction. On the home front, Clinton faces
possible removal in the Senate after the House impeached him on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Saddam emerged from his bunker Sunday to declare in a
televised address that Iraq had defeated ``enemies of God.'' Iraq
also has vowed to end all dealings with U.N. weapons inspectors
responsible for dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction _
chemical, biological and nuclear.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Clinton administration acted last week to remove Hussein
from power, few tears would have been shed. Had the Clinton
administration chosen to schedule tough bargaining sessions with
Iraqi diplomats over the problems cited in UNSCOM chairman Richard
Butler's report to the U.N. Security Council, support would have
come from all quarters.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a measure of how little support the U.S. commanded in
this sudden foray, compared to the broad-based coalition put
together by President Bush, that only Britain actively joined in
the attack. Russia, China and France, all members of the U.N.
Security Council, strongly opposed the attack.
</P>
<P>
   So where do the attacks leave us? Pretty much where we were
before, except that we no longer can even pretend to be inspecting
Saddam's arms. While the seven-year inspection program never had
much chance of preventing Saddam from rearming after the Gulf War,
it did provide some information to the United Nations about
Saddam's arms program. Despite firing more than 200 cruise missiles
and dropping bombs on 100 sites, Saddam still retains the ability
to rearm.
</P>
<P>
   What did the United States hope to accomplish? The United States
knew going in that Saddam was able to withstand the far greater
firepower and military strength exerted against him in the Gulf
War. On this incursion, the United States mustered less than
one-tenth of the aircraft launched in the 1991 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain clearly intended for this attack
to be short in duration. The secretary of state said the aim of the
attack was to retard Saddam's capacity for warmaking. That's not
much of a long-range vision for the region.
</P>
<P>
   The attack, which could have been ordered months ago, or even
months from now, was viewed by critics as politically inspired and
having little military purpose. Some former and current government
officials charged that the White House orchestrated a plan to
elicit Saddam's defiance to justify the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has a curious history regarding
Saddam; it gets excited about him only at certain times. When Scott
Ritter, a U.S. member of the UNSCOM team resigned in disgust
earlier in the year, complaining that he got no support from the
administration to fight Saddam's thwarting of the inspection
program, that wasn't what Clinton wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   So the administration unleashed the big guns to trash the
officer's reputation _ something that happens a lot to critics of
Clinton. If the administration saw nothing wrong with Saddam then,
what was so different this time?
</P>
<P>
   Now we are left to assess exactly what was accomplished and, one
more time, deal with Saddam. It is almost certain that the true
victims of the attacks were the Iraqi people, not Saddam. And it is
the Iraqi people we profess to want to help while hating their
leader.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should continue economic sanctions and
maintain tight military controls over Iraq. The United States also
should seek to strengthen diplomatic support for reinstituting
weapons inspections and launching strikes when merited. It is
unlikely these attacks weakened Saddam to any sort of internal
revolt. &QL;

MAKING A CASE FOR `CIVIL ACTION'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In Jonathan Harr's best-selling book, ``A Civil
Action,'' personal injury attorney Jan Schlichtmann outlines his
personal mission in clear, concise terms. ``To become rich and
famous by doing good.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlichtmann repeats it again and again, and the mantra comes to
define him as he takes on two large corporations that, he believes,
poisoned a Massachusetts town's drinking water, leading to the
leukemia deaths of eight children. The case consumes him to the
point where he mortgages his firm's future _ not to mention every
possession he owns _ upon its outcome.
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to transform the book into a movie, Steven
Zaillian (who turned ``Schindler's List'' into Oscar gold for
Steven Spielberg) read Harr's work and decided that Schlichtmann
was a liar. Or at least in a deep state of denial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anyone who says something like that has a problem,''
says Zaillian, who also directed the film adaptation, which stars
John Travolta as Schlichtmann.
</P>
<P>
   ``You either do good or you make money. But you don't try to
combine them. And to get famous, too? It's too many things to go
for at the same time, so one of them you can't be that passionate
about.''
</P>
<P>
   And Zaillian is convinced it's the ``doing good'' part. So, fans
of the book (and there are a lot of them _ ``A Civil Action'' has
been an enduring best seller since it was published more than three
years ago) instantly will realize that Zaillian has made
Schlichtmann into more of a mercenary ambulance chaser than a man
trying to juggle too many conflicting motivations.
</P>
<P>
   It's an obvious change, but not a jarring one. In fact,
Zaillian's 110-minute movie is a rather faithful adaptation of
Harr's complex 500-page work, not the easiest of tasks when you
consider Harr's estimate that it takes most people 30 hours to read
the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, he had to compress a lot of things,'' Harr says.
(Zaillian's first draft was 225 pages. He shot 150 and kept 100 in
the final, finished version.) ``But _ and this kind of surprised me
_ the essence of the book is still there.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth be known, Zaillian is a bit surprised, too. Take away its
best-seller status and ``A Civil Action'' isn't exactly natural
movie material. The trial itself was boring, the details of the
case were mind-numbing and the ending was ambiguous at best,
downbeat at worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't many Hollywood courtroom moments, are there?''
Travolta asks. ``There's nothing along the lines of,'' and here he
adds a little heat to his voice, ``You're out of order! No, YOU'RE
OUT OF ORDER!!! Or: I want the truth! You can't handle the
truth!!!''
</P>
<P>
   Travolta pauses, composing himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. We're a little more low-key here.''
</P>
<P>
   That's fitting, since Zaillian, 45, is a quiet, decidedly
hype-free individual. ``A Civil Action'' is his second film,
following his critically acclaimed, but little-seen 1993 debut
``Searching for Bobby Fischer.'' The five-year gap between movies
certainly can be explained by Zaillian's screenwriting duties.
Although ``Clear and Present Danger'' is his last screenplay
credit, he has doctored several films since then, including
``Saving Private Ryan,'' ``Amistad'' and ``Mission: Impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, Zaillian is a perfectionist, a stickler for
details, however minute they might seem to others. William Macy,
cast as the law firm's despairing financial partner, says Zaillian
will keep shooting ``until someone cries `uncle'.'' Robert Duvall,
who plays Schlichtmann's opposing counsel, recalls seeing Zaillian
so consumed that ``we'd watch him bump into walls four or five
times _ and that was before lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds kind of cute, in an almost absent-minded professor
sort of way, until you hear rumblings from the set that the shoot
was too grueling, that Zaillian filmed different takes just for the
sole purpose of moving an ashtray or push pins on a map and that
Travolta was complaining that Zaillian never bothered to share the
film's overall vision with him.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, Travolta, putting on his best face for an interview,
offers, ``The film took a toll on me. Was it too much? It was
definitely in the ballpark. I couldn't do two `Civil Actions' back
to back. But just like Jan Schlichtmann was asked at the end of the
movie, `If you had to do it all over again, would you?' I would.''
Pause. ``Just not two in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Zaillian pleads guilty _ with extenuating
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes an actor doesn't know the line or understand the
line and I'm going to keep shooting until they do,'' Zaillian says.
``If that's meticulous, that's what it is. But I'm going to keep
shooting until everybody does their job.''
</P>
<P>
   Physically, Travolta looks nothing like the tall, rail-thin
Schlichtmann, a man who became even more gaunt as the long trial
wore on. (``Initially, everyone thought of Jeff Goldblum,'' Harr
says.) Tom Hanks also was considered, much to Harr's dismay.
(``That would have been `Bonfire of the Vanities','' he says.
``Hanks is a good actor, but he cannot play slick, oily
characters.'')
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Zaillian tabbed Travolta because he believed he was
an actor who could tap into the dark side of movie-star charisma.
</P>
<P>
   ``John loves himself, he's rather vain _ not in a bad way _ and
he has a magnetic personality, just as Jan Schlichtmann does in the
early part of the film,'' Zaillian says. ``After that, it's not a
real showy part. In fact, it's probably the most understated
performance John has given in his career.''
</P>
<P>
   And that leads to the tricky part. You have a muted Travolta, a
complex, morally ambiguous legal case totally devoid of courtroom
theatrics and an unsentimental, less-than-dramatic ending where
everyone loses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really kind of remarkable any studio wanted to make this
film,'' Duvall says, chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, the studio that did make the film, has its marketing
team doing its darndest to lure audiences to theaters, stressing
the movie's courtroom setting (a Hollywood staple) and Travolta's
star power. Zaillian, ever the perfectionist, doesn't approve,
bemoaning the way the studio is presenting ``A Civil Action'' to
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trailer doesn't make it look like a smart movie,''
Zaillian complains. ``You know what it looks like _ a Grisham
movie. But they say you need to make it accessible to bring people
in.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what they say. And with a real-life legal case that comes
loaded with a series of messy endings, Disney _ and the filmmakers
_ would like to put a different stamp on the fate of this project.
</P>
<P>
   Happy. &QL;

IT'S EASY TO SALUTE `THE GENERAL'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Our rating: 4 Stars. 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Truth is stranger than pulp fiction in ``The
General,'' John Boorman's enthralling, magnificent look at
real-life Irish crime lord Martin Cahill.
</P>
<P>
   With a one-of-a-kind, force-of-nature performance by Brendan
Gleeson, filmed in luminous, wide-screen black and white because
Boorman just wanted to, ``The General'' is simultaneously a great
caper film, a smart and radical social satire and the most
compelling character study you'll see this season.
</P>
<P>
   It is, without question, one of the year's best films. And
Cahill was the kind of guy no screenwriter possesses the
imagination to dream up.
</P>
<P>
   A congenital thief who was raised in an underclass Dublin
housing project (he's played as an exuberant, felonious lad by
``The Butcher Boy'' himself, Eamonn Owens), Cahill always looked at
life as an us-vs.-them proposition. Us were his neighbors (who, by
extension, were the only people who qualified for membership in his
gang), them being any representative of authority who crossed his
path _ the police, the upper classes, the media, the Church, even
terrorists of the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   Boorman, a determinedly personal filmmaker who has given us such
great movies as ``Point Blank,'' ``Deliverance,'' ``Excalibur'' and
``Hope and Glory,'' is much too smart to portray Cahill as any real
Robin Hood _ except, perhaps, in the mobster's own mind. Indeed,
Cahill once burgled Englishman Boorman's Dublin home; there's a
scene in the movie where he tries to figure out how on Earth to
fence the director's gold-record award for ``Dueling Banjos.''
</P>
<P>
   So, along with Cahill's planning brilliance and abundant
charisma, we're also treated to his every egocentric,
self-destructive, megalomaniacal, sadistic move. The pool-hall
crucifixion should dispel any notion of the General as a class
hero, even if he did personally take his victim to the emergency
room afterward.
</P>
<P>
   That said, this is clearly one wayward genius's tribute to
another. Even as he charts Cahill's emotional and physical decline,
Boorman can't help but celebrate the man's ingenuity and audacity.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill was formidable, no question about it. He could break into
any home and steal anything he wanted, often right under the noses
of its sleeping or lovemaking residents. He engineered one of the
biggest diamond robberies in Irish history, stole the nation's only
Vermeer from a high-tech security gallery, even broke into law
libraries at night to bone up on courtroom defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill would spend whole nights lodging ludicrous complaints at
his local police station, which established airtight alibis while
his mates robbed nearby banks. When the cops put his home and
person under intensive, 24-hour surveillance, he still managed to
commit crimes. Always covering his face in public, he'd deny
anything was wrong while television cameras filmed the two
uniformed cops standing right behind him _ and this in the line
outside the welfare office, where the officially unemployed Cahill
went to collect his monthly government check.
</P>
<P>
   His personal relationships were no less conventional. Hopelessly
devoted to his wife and childhood sweetheart Frances (Maria Doyle
Kennedy), he nonetheless lusted for her younger sister Tina
(Angeline Ball). Both women proved unusually understanding and
accommodating about the situation.
</P>
<P>
   And Cahill's unusual relationship with the detective in charge
of bringing him down _ a fictionalized composite figure played by
Jon Voight here _ is a complex thing, rich with admiration,
exasperation, disappointment and strategic competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Dominating it all is Gleeson, whom you may have caught earlier
this year as another cagey Irish gangster in the wholly fictional
``I Went Down.'' A chunky, pug-nosed guy in his mid 40s, his eyes
dance with intelligence and just the right hint of madness. He
plays Cahill as an unpredictable force of amoral and inscrutable
brilliance, but also as a guy with often phenomenal self-control.
There's a stillness to the performance that's as impressive as its
showier aspects.
</P>
<P>
   Boorman, who's always been interested in the concept of
intelligent anarchy, has found a perfect symbol for his great theme
in Cahill. It's not just their cussed rebelliousness that unites
artist and subject here. The movie is all about the sheer thrill
that each man has in plying his craft to the best of his remarkable
ability. &QL;

`FLIGHT' SOARS AS QUIRKY ROMANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
LOS ANGELES _ ``The Theory of Flight'' may be many things _ uneven,
funny, confounding, disarming _ but it is as far from typical
disease movie fare as you can get and still have the lead character
in a wheelchair and struggling with a speech impediment. Its story
can be slight and somewhat obvious at times, but this rather
unconventional romantic comedy has enough surprises, along with
another bravura performance from actress Helena Bonham Carter, to
make for an engaging moviegoing experience.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bonham Carter stars as Jane, a bright young woman watching her
body disintegrate at the hands of the neurological disease known as
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal condition that
gradually paralyzes the body's muscles while leaving the mind
unaffected. Jane doesn't spend much time feeling sorry for herself,
though. She's fiercely intelligent, loves to laugh and is quite
open about her dreams for adventure, love and, quite especially,
sex. At age 25, Jane is hungry to lose her virginity and eagerly
looking for someone to help her in that department.
</P>
<P>
   Into her life, reluctantly, comes Richard (Kenneth Branagh), a
man-child having trouble facing adulthood. After trying to fly a
homemade glider off the roof of a London high-rise (Peter Pan
syndrome, indeed!), Richard is sentenced to 120 hours of community
service. He flees London and a failed relationship and seeks refuge
in the country, where he fulfills his service duty by taking Jane
on weekly outings. They're the classic mismatched pair: He runs
from adult responsibility, while she would do anything to achieve
adult fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Greengrass, directing from a screenplay by first-time
writer Richard Hawkins, accentuates the story's whimsy and humor
and never lets the film become mired in the mawkish sentimentality
and melodrama inherent in the genre. It's a fine approach, even if
Branagh and (to a lesser extent) Bonham Carter aren't always
successful in achieving the right, light touch. There are plenty of
refreshing, taboo-breaking scenes (Jane using her vocal amplifier
to comic, foul-mouthed effect in a restaurant; Richard
propositioning a gigolo on her behalf) to keep the story
interesting and involving.
</P>
<P>
   Bonham Carter delivers yet another absorbing performance by
letting Jane's eccentric charm come to the fore without obscuring
the seriousness of her quest for meaningful experiences or the
underlying sadness of her condition. For the role, Bonham Carter
has cut her long hair and donned bright, bold clothes such as a
cherry-red Lucky Strike leather jacket and a T-shirt that reads ``I
didn't get this far on looks alone.''
</P>
<P>
   By itself, that sums up this adventurous young woman's attitude,
not to mention the film's perspective of how laughter often can be
the only response to an absurd _ and grave _ situation.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIS, Calif. _ For two decades and more, Mats and Dafne
Engstrom have been working on a project that he compares to making
paper by planting a forest.
</P>
<P>
   Their goal is to produce caviar comparable to that from the
Caspian Sea _ specifically the variety known as osetra _ from the
eggs of farm-raised California sturgeon.
</P>
<P>
   The process works well, and the need is evident given the
critical problems with supplies from Russia. The difficulty is that
it takes the slow-growing sturgeon, the descendants of wild fish
taken from the Sacramento River, a very long time to reach an age
when they produce roe.
</P>
<P>
   While they watched and waited, the Engstroms have for several
years been selling small quantities of California caviar, which
they made from other people's farm-bred sturgeon, to restaurants
like Charlie Trotter's in Chicago and Aqua in San Francisco. The
boys in the back room are thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian osetra has a slightly more pronounced and
concentrated flavor,'' said Michael Mina, the chef at Aqua. ``The
texture may be a tiny bit better, too, but the differences are very
slight. And there are two huge advantages to the California
product: it is affordable and consistent, whereas Russian caviar is
either very unreliable these days or very expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Trotter's verdict: ``Perhaps not quite as opulent, but it has a
lovely creaminess and headiness, and the reliability is vastly
superior.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after endless experiments and adventures, and not a few
failures, the Engstroms, both Swedish-born American citizens, are
on the verge of producing the stuff in quantity at a tank farm they
have almost completed in the wilds of northeastern California.
</P>
<P>
   A second company, Stolt Sea Farms, part of an international
group, is in the same business, already selling caviar under the
brand name Sterling. It grew out of a firm the Engstroms started
but lost after a series of economic reverses, and in which, maybe
for sentimental reasons, they retain a tiny holding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep swimming upstream,'' said Engstrom, whose whimsical
good humor survived both his years at the Harvard Business School
and a fire a few years back that nearly wiped him out. ``By the
start of the caviar harvesting season in February of next year, we
will be ready to take about one ton of caviar from our female
sturgeon.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing could hardly be better. The United States is cut off
from Iranian caviar for political reasons, and quality control has
collapsed in Russia and the other former Soviet republics bordering
the Caspian.
</P>
<P>
   After indicting a New York company called Gino International
last week for illicitly importing caviar from Poland, the federal
government charged that half the caviar brought here is mislabeled,
old, previously frozen or contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Caspian sturgeon, many caught by impoverished peasants,
are being killed for food long before they can produce the
lucrative roe.
</P>
<P>
   The Engstroms' California product, which should be on sale to
the public sometime next year at prices a bit lower than its
Russian counterpart, comes from a fish whose biological name,
Acipenser transmontanus, betrays its close relationship to Caspian
osetra, which is Acipenser gueldenstaedtii. It will carry the brand
name Tsar Nicoulai, like their caviar from the Amur River in China
and from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lived with these fish for 20 years, a third of our
lives,'' Mrs. Engstrom said. ``It's been a very long haul. If you
knew all the hopes and fears and tears ...''
</P>
<P>
   The beluga from the Caspian, generally considered the ne plus
ultra of the caviar world, comes from a fish called Huso huso; the
Amur River caviar, marketed as giant beluga, comes from a close
cousin called Huso dauricus. But many prefer osetra for its
firmness and a slight nuttiness of flavor.
</P>
<P>
   America's lakes and rivers, including the Hudson, once teemed
with sturgeon, whose roe was salted and sold (or in some saloons in
San Francisco, given away). But by 1910, overfishing had done its
ruinous work.
</P>
<P>
   In California, commercial fishing for the white sturgeon in the
Sacramento River, which flows into San Francisco Bay, was outlawed
in 1917.
</P>
<P>
   State authorities allow the capture of a few wild fish each
spring. These are taken into hatcheries where the eggs and milt are
combined, yielding tens of thousands of fingerlings. To induce
spawning, the sturgeon are injected with a hormone taken from a
carp's pituitary gland.
</P>
<P>
   A Caesarean section is performed, the eggs are removed and the
fish is sewn up and released back into the river or kept as a part
of the brood stock. Sometimes a few fingerlings are returned to the
wild, but most of them are kept for aquaculture.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian expert, Serge I. Doroshov, happened to arrive at the
University of California campus at Davis, near Sacramento, just as
the first sturgeon born in captivity were reaching maturity. As the
director of the Aquaculture and Fisheries Program here, he did some
of the pioneering work on how best to produce caviar from farmed
fish.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   U.C. Davis, already known as the fountainhead of winemaking
knowledge in the state, added another distinction.
</P>
<P>
   Engstrom, who is now 61, and his wife, now 60, had begun in
aquaculture by raising crayfish for sale to Sweden, where they are
a traditional late-summer delicacy. But it was a seasonal business,
so the Engstroms hit upon importing caviar instead of exporting
crayfish.
</P>
<P>
   Their company, California Sunshine Fine Foods, started importing
from Russia. Then, one day, a fisherman in California mentioned to
Engstrom that he caught sturgeon. He fed the roe to the family
cats. Engstrom filed that tidbit away.
</P>
<P>
   The Engstroms set up a processing plant in China, in a site so
remote that getting there required a two-day ride in an unheated
train, a Jeep ride and a ferry crossing. They embarked on a Russian
joint venture. At almost every turn, they faced double-dealing and
theft, stonewalling apparatchiks and scheming bureaucrats. Caviar
is big money. Everyone wants a taste.
</P>
<P>
   And overfishing began to deplete the fish that lay the golden
eggs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians are destroying their resource, and the Chinese
are close to the same thing,'' Engstrom said. ``So after a while we
decided that farmed fish were the only answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Doroshov, a sprightly, gray-haired man with the grace of a
ballet master, said he doubted whether there were more than a
handful of beluga sturgeon left in the Caspian, owing to disease
and to overfishing.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether California caviar would ever measure up to the
Russian original, he emphasized that sturgeon aquaculture was still
in its formative stage, that much more time and money would be
needed and that farmed fish like trout, tilapia and salmon never
exactly matched wild fish in flavor.
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``I don't see any reason from a scientific point
of view that California caviar cannot very closely replicate
Caspian caviar. And who is to say that we will have any Russian
caviar left in a few years?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Engstroms cured their first batch of 400 pounds of
California caviar, adapting the techniques they had learned
elsewhere. They salted the roe very lightly, mimicking the Russian
process called malossol, which means ``little salt.'' The eggs came
from fish raised by a Sacramento-area farmer, Ken Beer; by then,
the Engstroms had lost their own original farm.
</P>
<P>
   Like a medieval alchemist intent on preserving his formulas from
rivals, Engstrom is unwilling to disclose to outsiders the precise
location of his big new operation, with 60 tanks, each holding
70,000 gallons of water, or precisely what techniques he plans to
use there. But a small experimental tank farm near here, run by the
university, gives a reasonable idea.
</P>
<P>
   The big, dark fish swim constantly in circles around tanks 4
feet deep and 20 feet in diameter, each filled with rapidly flowing
water. It is recycled to nearby farmlands, not back into the tanks;
when he tried that, Engstrom said, ``the fish hated it, and to
spite us, refused to grow.'' Now, well-acclimated, the fish are fed
24 hours a day by mechanical devices that dispense brown pellets
that resemble dog chow, physically and nutritionally.
</P>
<P>
   In the wild, many sturgeon take as much as 25 years before
reproducing. But with warmer water temperatures _ Engstrom plans to
use geothermal energy from hot springs _ and with a high-protein
diet, the time can be cut to seven to nine years, he believes.
</P>
<P>
   It is an economically crucial point, because every batch of
caviar costs the life of a female sturgeon, so a fingerling must be
raised to maturity to replace it. The shorter the cycle, the
cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Sturgeon meat is delicious both fresh and smoked, and the
Engstroms hope to make a dent in that market, too, which is now
dominated by Atlantic sturgeon.
</P>
<P>
   The fish in the tanks here, about four to five feet long, weigh
about 25 to 30 pounds. With barbels like catfish and five long,
bony ridges called scutes along their backs, bellies and sides, the
sturgeon resemble sharks.
</P>
<P>
   The two fish are not related biologically, but both of them have
blunt noses, widely spaced eyes and skeletons made mostly of
cartilage instead of bone.
</P>
<P>
   Why, I asked Erik F. Hallen Jr., who runs the experimental
station, are the sturgeon called white when they are black?
``Sunburn,'' he said. They are shielded from the sun in the murky
Sacramento River, but the tanks are open to the skies, and the
sunlight turns their skins a much darker color.
</P>
<P>
   They are primitive fish; sturgeon fossils 200 million years old
have been uncovered. They are frightening looking; it is hard to
imagine something as gastronomically aristocratic as caviar coming
from their innards.
</P>
<P>
   But then truffles grow underground, on gnarled old tree roots.

A BOTTLE OF PURE POETRY, SO SELDOMLY SIPPED 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Sherry-Lehmann &AMP; Co., the New York wine merchant,
offered its customers a taste of Taittinger's Comtes de Champagne,
a premium wine from the superb 1990 vintage. Even an experienced
Champagne hand was surprised at what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was astonishing,'' said Gerard Yvernault, who works for
Taittinger's importer, Kobrand &AMP; Co. ``People fought their way to
the counter for a taste, then said, `Delicious. I'll take three or
four.' No one questioned the price, which is $110 a bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the buyers were just caught up in the spirit of the
holiday season. Perhaps they were celebrating a prosperous year. Or
maybe these shoppers had heard the rumors that Champagne will be in
short supply as the 20th century comes to a close and were simply
stocking up _ for next year's New Year celebrations, as well as
this one's.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. There is no shortage of Champagne. Supplies are
abundant now and still will be this time next year. What may be
hard to find are the most expensive wines, the ones the French call
tetes de cuvee and we call super premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Comtes de Champagne, they include Moet &AMP; Chandon's
Dom Perignon, Bollinger's R.D. (for Recently Disgorged), Krug's
Clos du Mesnil, Roederer's Cristal, Pol Roger's Cuvee Sir Winston
Churchill and Veuve Clicquot's La Grande Dame.
</P>
<P>
   While all Champagne prices are expected to increase next year,
some of the prestige labels may climb beyond $300 a bottle. There
is little doubt that such wines will find buyers, especially in
this country. After all, the less consumers know about what's in
the bottle, the more they are willing to pay for the label.
</P>
<P>
   Not that this lack of knowledge about Champagne is entirely the
consumer's fault. Champagne is not an integral part of American
life: most people drink it only a few times a year, at weddings and
holidays. You cannot learn what you like, let alone what is good,
when sipping is so seldom.
</P>
<P>
   What makes a good Champagne? Facile scribblers from Voltaire to
Hemingway, passing through Byron, Kipling and Shaw, have tried to
explain, but when it comes to taste and smell, poetic metaphor is
not much help. So here goes:
</P>
<P>
   Its color, except for rose, should be yellow, though it can
range across the spectrum from pale old ivory to the burnished gold
of a Roman coin. It should be fresh, lively and perfectly clear.
</P>
<P>
   It should offer an array of delightful aromas from citrus to
newly baked bread, but not all at once. It should produce tiny
bubbles that last until the bottle is empty. Its taste can differ
from bottle to bottle, from brand to brand, and in vintage wine,
from year to year.
</P>
<P>
   I look for Champagnes with a nutty flavor, hazelnuts mostly,
that come from older reserve wines in the blend. Beyond that, I too
fall back on metaphor, borrowing a particular one now and then from
old Dom Perignon. Once, after sipping a memorable glass, he is
supposed to have sighed and said, ``I am tasting stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Poetry aside, no wine should be intimidating, and for those
occasional drinkers, here's a tip: It's not necessary to spend a
lot to get a good bottle of Champagne. There are plenty of
excellent ones in the $25 to $40 range.
</P>
<P>
   At that price, of course, you are buying non-vintage Champagne,
made from a blend of grapes that were harvested in different years.
The occasional Champagne drinker will not be disappointed with such
non-vintage wines as Veuve Clicquot's Yellow Label, Lanson's Black
Label, Pommery's Brut Royale, Bollinger's Special Cuvee or Moet &AMP;
Chandon's Brut Imperial.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, to a Champagne devotee, a vintage wine _ one from a
terrific year _ that on the lower end could cost $45 to $65, and
for premium wines in the hundreds of dollars, may be well worth the
money.
</P>
<P>
   These Champagnes are made in limited quantities and can be
scarce at any time. Demand for them has been heightened because the
current vintage for most of them is 1990, one of the finest
vintages in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 1990s are already sold out, and connoisseurs are
looking back to the previous great vintage in Champagne, 1985.
Stocks of 1985, and of 1988 and 1989, both exceptional years, are
small and the prices are correspondingly high. Krug's
all-chardonnay Clos du Mesnil 1989 is $250 or more in good wine
shops.
</P>
<P>
   The next top-quality vintage is 1996, but it will be available
in only limited amounts by New Year's Eve 1999. By law, vintage
Champagne cannot be marketed until three years after the harvest
and, in practice, many of the super-premium wines are held for up
to five years before being released.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, vintage Champagnes are made only in outstanding
years. In the past, most Champagne houses declared no more than two
or three vintages in a decade. Now there can be six or seven.
Better grape-growing and wine-making techniques may account for
some of the increase, but the public's obsession with vintages
certainly plays a role as well.
</P>
<P>
   Is vintage Champagne better than non-vintage? Sometimes, and
from some producers, but, for the occasional Champagne drinker, not
often enough to justify the difference in price. Champagne's
reputation is based as much on skillful marketing as good
wine-making, and the industry is well prepared for the millennium
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Special cuvees in engraved bottles, often housed in elegant
wooden boxes, are already to be found in some markets. They are,
needless to say, overpriced.
</P>
<P>
   I have never drunk a vintage Champagne that was inferior to its
non-vintage counterpart, but I've had more than a few that were not
appreciably better. What's more, there are Champagne makers who
privately scoff at the vintage mania. Skillful blending is the
essence of their trade, and that includes the blending of wines of
different vintages.
</P>
<P>
   More than any still wine, Champagne is a brand product, and the
people who make it pride themselves on the styles that distinguish
their brands. A Champagne producer will set aside as much as a
third of each year's wine as a reserve for making future blends.
</P>
<P>
   A final non-vintage blend from a major Champagne house may
include more than 100 different wines from ten different years and
25 different villages in the Champagne region.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from an occasional foray into the prestige Champagnes,
notably to Bollinger's R.D. and Krug's Grande Cuvee, my own taste
runs more to non-vintage wines like Laurent-Perrier's Brut, which
is often 50 percent chardonnay; Veuve Clicquot's Yellow Label, a
rich, ripe wine with a long finish; Mumm's Cordon Rouge, a round
and fruity Champagne, and Perrier-Jouet's Grand Brut, a wine with
attractive richness and an intriguing biscuit taste on the finish.
These run $25 to $45.
</P>
<P>
   These wines are mostly light- to medium-bodied Champagnes. For a
big bodied, assertive wine, there is no substitute for Bollinger's
Special Cuvee. Someone once described the Bollinger style as
``almost beefy.'' That may be exaggerated, but for serious holiday
toasting, it would be my choice.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and keep in mind that Champagne doesn't benefit much from
aging; it's made to be drunk when it's released. But a year in a
quiet, dark corner can't hurt it, either. Even if it's not packaged
for the millennium.

CAVIAR PALACES: SOLEMN TO AFFABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RUTH REICHL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Caviar at home is a pleasure; caviar in restaurants
is a statement. Eaten in the privacy of your own abode, caviar is a
special treat, a way of being good to yourself and those you love.
But eaten in public, caviar becomes a declaration, and where you
choose to indulge says a great deal about you.
</P>
<P>
   This came to me one afternoon as I watched two women plow
through a small mountain of caviar in the clamorous, prosaic
atmosphere of CAVIARTERIA in the Delmonico Hotel. The women ignored
the people making purchases at the nearby caviar counter.
</P>
<P>
   They seemed oblivious of the banter of the men in the open
kitchen behind them. They paid even less heed to those sitting at
the counter feasting on Caviarteria's best bargain: crepes filled
with broken beluga, a fine treat at a fine price. But they were
clearly not there to save money.
</P>
<P>
   They began with a few ounces of beluga, quickly devouring the
glistening black eggs; if they noticed the excellent quality of the
caviar, they did not say so. Nor did they mention that the blini
were too sweet and the toast too cold as they plunged into an order
of osetra. That pleased them so well that they soon ordered some
more.
</P>
<P>
   In moments, the women had polished off a few hundred dollars'
worth of caviar. They did it with enormous insouciance, as if this
were no more than a coffee shop they were stopping into for a
snack. Having finished, they wiped their mouths, paid their bill,
picked up their shopping bags and sauntered out. Their attitude
made it clear that caviar, to them, is an everyday occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   The patrons of the nearby CAVIAR RUSSE are an entirely different
breed. Intent on savoring every luxurious moment of the experience,
they seek out the small restaurant, hidden away on the second
floor. They revel in the tranquillity of this attractive oasis,
which is dedicated to the proposition that caviar is anything but
ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with its blue and white walls and fanciful murals,
Caviar Russe seems to belong more in a fairy tale than in midtown
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   A fairy godmother waving her wand might come up with something
very like the Caviar Russe specialty: tiny mother-of-pearl spoons
laden with twinkling roe in varied colors. It is jewelry for the
mouth; clearly, the people who patronize Caviar Russe are in search
of an exotic experience. I like tasting my way through the
spoonfuls of caviar, but in the end the most exotic experience is
the hard-to-find golden osetra, with its wonderfully nutty flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Although it, too, is a homage to Russia, FIREBIRD offers caviar
in an entirely different mood. This is a caviar carnival, a place
where people can indulge in caviar for the sheer fun of it. It is a
halcyon experience, pure theater, with waiters rolling caviar into
blini and setting them on your plate. They do it with such panache
that each time it happens, I expect drum rolls.
</P>
<P>
   But to me, PETROSSIAN offers the ultimate caviar experience. In
this dark, hushed cathedral to caviar, solemn waiters approach
their work with reverence. There is gravity in the way they take
your order and begin setting out the ritual objects _ the special
spoons and plates for caviar _ and even more gravity in the way
they carry the caviar in on its silver stand.
</P>
<P>
   Delivering the caviar is only the beginning of the waiter's
responsibility. He must then dance attendance upon the roe. ``More
blini?'' he murmurs softly. ``More toast?'' Cold blini are whisked
away; fresh ones appear under silver domes.
</P>
<P>
   New slices of warm toast come at regular intervals. The effect
is so splendid that even the vodka, in its icy silver flutes, seems
colder, thicker, more delicious than ordinary alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   At Petrossian, it is impossible to be blase about caviar. And it
is not unusual to find diners nodding appreciatively at one another
across the room, as if to say, ``Yes, we are the true connoisseurs
of caviar.''

GLORY OF CHRIST'S BIRTH SHINES IN `NATIVITY' EXHIBIT IN DALLAS

   ``And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in
swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger, because there was no
room for them in the inn.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the
field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And lo, the angel
of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round
about them, and they were sore afraid.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the angel said unto them, `Fear not: for, behold, I bring
you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For
unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is
Christ the Lord.'''

<P>
   DALLAS _ Nary a photograph nor sketch recorded the scene 2,000
years ago, yet each detail endures in collective memory: Mary and
Joseph and the shepherds, the smell of hay, the rustle of cattle,
the vision of baby Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   We know the scene because we have seen it through the eyes of
Rembrandt and Tintoretto, El Greco, Gauguin and Sunday school
coloring books.
</P>
<P>
   Today, we can see it anew through the eyes of artists bent on
interpreting not just the scene but also the symbolism of Christ's
birth.
</P>
<P>
   This Christmas, the Biblical Arts Center in Dallas is featuring
an exhibit called ``Nativity.''
</P>
<P>
   Included is a range of styles in a variety of mediums:
traditional creches, serious-minded oils, exuberant acrylics and
invitingly warm sculptures in ebony and clay.
</P>
<P>
   A few hundred yards east of the gallery, Christmas commercialism
is in full swing at the upscale NorthPark Center. But within the
stone confines of the museum, all is calm and bright.
</P>
<P>
   Curator Susan Richardson calls it her ``Santa-free zone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here you'll find the real reason for celebrating the season,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   For New York artist Ann Kim, the reason for the season
translates into vermilion stick men dancing against a cerulean sky.
Her imposing triptych ``Three Wise Men, Shepherd, Christ the Lord''
dominates the gallery's south wall.
</P>
<P>
   The first panel introduces three featureless figures _ simple
twists of plaster protruding from the canvas _ dancing on a
hillside. The line of the hill leads to the second panel, where
another trio of men dances. The final panel concludes with a lone
figure, much like the first, only smaller and surrounded by a cloud
of light.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very joyful thing,'' Kim said last week from her New
York home. ``The sub-theme is awakening. It's like the beginning of
the second creation.''
</P>
<P>
   The theme reflects the work of God in her own life. Although she
grew up in a Christian home, Kim said she had a ``born-again''
experience four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Christianity, right now it is very small like baby Jesus,''
she said. ``But it will grow eventually.'' Whereas Kim's work is a
joyful shout, the earth-toned oil across the gallery is a
reverently whispered description of the same scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Adoration of the Shepherds'' was painted by Dallas artist
Alberta Newton Bell in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kim, Bell dips her brush into a carefully cultivated
spiritual life.
</P>
<P>
   When she creates, it is rarely just an exercise in technique.
She paints to pass on something of herself.
</P>
<P>
   This you learn when she explains her work.
</P>
<P>
   An African-American, Bell colors her wise men in decidedly brown
hues, but she is quick to correct anyone who calls her brown men
black.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say, `Why are you using all black?' They aren't
all black,'' she said. ``They are neither black nor white ... Jesus
came to save all. He didn't die for only one race, color or
creed,'' she said. ``He said, `Whosoever shall believe in me.'''
</P>
<P>
   For these artists, few images communicate the message of
``whosoever will'' like the birth of Jesus, Immanuel, God with us.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby Jesus seems tiny, small, but it also gives people
hope and comfort in a way,'' Kim said. ``It seems like a childish
kind of event, but people feel more comfortable with that.''

A FAMOUS PORTUGUESE CHEESE WITH AN AMERICAN TOUCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (fb) 
By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the menu it hardly seemed a dish of note: a spot
of cheese, some dried fruits and roasted almonds.
</P>
<P>
   But this combination led three friends and me to wax rhapsodic
as we each took a bite of the most famous of all Portuguese
cheeses, queijo de Serra, with a bit of fig drizzled with balsamic
vinegar. Could it possibly have tasted so luscious? We each took
another bite, then another and another, trying the cheese with some
dates, then with almonds, and then, in complete abandon, with
everything in one mouthful, on a bit of crisped bread.
</P>
<P>
   The buttery sheep's-milk cheese, with the texture of a runny
reblochon but much milder, wraps each piece of fruit in its
sweetness. But it is the 20-year-old balsamic vinegar, syrupy and
sweetly sharp, that makes the dish something that is more than the
sum of its parts _ while allowing the taste and texture of each
element to shine through.
</P>
<P>
   The revelations took place at O Padeiro, a Portuguese bakery in
Chelsea that started serving food in June. While you would not find
a similar pairing of fruit and cheese in Portugal, dried fruits and
almonds are an important part of Portuguese cooking. How typically
American to meld different culinary cultures, creating something
even better than the original. The plate, which can be eaten by one
hungry person or shared by four, is $12.

FOIE GRAS: RICH, SILKY AND SUBTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 This is the third of eight columns by Alfred Portale, the executive
chef and an owner of Gotham Bar and Grill in Manhattan. His
collaborator on these columns is Dorie Greenspan.  
 By ALFRED PORTALE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Foie gras, plump, extraordinarily rich duck liver, is an
expensive, elegant indulgence. It's also surprisingly versatile. I
prepare it year-round, changing its accompaniments with the
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, I paired slices of sauteed foie gras with roasted
peaches and red-wine vinegar; in late fall, its partners were
poached quinces and pomegranate sauce. And for New Year's Eve, I've
created this dish of seared foie gras, roasted pears, honey,
rosemary and aged balsamic vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   In almost all of my foie gras dishes, the warm liver is paired
with sweet fruit and something tart or acidic. The acidity balances
the liver's richness, and the fruit is a supportive companion to
its subtle flavor and silky texture.
</P>
<P>
   When I chose roasted pears to go with the foie gras, I decided
to bolster their sweetness with a touch of honey. The rosemary was
added to pull the dish back to the savory side.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of using balsamic vinegar as the sauce just seemed
natural: pears and balsamic vinegar are served together all over
Italy, and I knew that the vinegar's complex sweet-sharp flavor
would work well against the fatty liver.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a first-time foie gras cook, you're about to learn
that foie gras is the ultimate fast food _ two minutes in the pan,
and it's done. But for it to be done properly, the liver shouldn't
be too cold when it goes into the pan; if it is, the outside will
cook and the inside won't.
</P>
<P>
   To get the temperature right, slice the foie gras and keep it
refrigerated until 15 minutes before you're ready to cook. Then, be
certain that the pan is medium-hot and that the slices get only a
minute of heat on each side.
</P>
<P>
   As long as you're going all out _ and serving foie gras is going
all out _ I urge you to try to finish this dish with a great
authentic aged balsamic vinegar from Modena, Italy. (At my
restaurant, I use rare 25-year-old balsamic, although a fine
12-year-old, still rare and expensive at $75 for six ounces, will
give you the depth and layers of flavor this dish deserves.)
</P>
<P>
   But if your balsamic vinegar isn't the best, don't give up. Just
concentrate the flavor by boiling it down by half, then drizzle it
over the foie gras, and head for the table. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEARED FOIE GRAS WITH CARAMELIZED PEARS AND BALSAMIC VINEGAR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons grape-seed or canola oil
</P>
<P>
   3 large firm Bosc pears, peeled, halved and cored
</P>
<P>
   { cup honey
</P>
<P>
   3 3-inch sprigs fresh rosemary, each sprig cut into 3 pieces
</P>
<P>
   \ cup port, preferably white port
</P>
<P>
   1 fresh foie gras (see note), very well chilled
</P>
<P>
   Coarse salt and freshly ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons aged balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   6 sprigs fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   6 sprigs fresh chervil. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Remove the foie gras from the refrigerator 15 minutes before
cooking. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Place a large oven-proof
saute pan over medium-high heat, and add the oil. When it is hot
but not smoking, add the pears. Immediately transfer the pan to the
oven. Roast the pears, turning often, until they begin to
caramelize, about 10 minutes. Stir in the honey and rosemary, and
continue to roast until the pears are golden and caramelized on all
sides, 6 to 8 minutes more.
</P>
<P>
   2. Transfer the pan to the stove top over medium heat, and add
the port. Stir briefly to scrape the bottom of the pan, and coat
the pears with the syrupy mixture. Turn the pears into a colander
and discard the rosemary and whatever cooking liquids have drained
from the pears. Keep the pears warm until serving time.
</P>
<P>
   3. Using your hands, carefully separate the two lobes of the
foie gras. If there is any fat at the separation point, trim and
discard it. Warm the blade of a sharp, thin knife in hot water. Dry
the blade, and cut each lobe of foie gras crosswise into
1-inch-thick slices. Keep the blade warm as you work, dipping it
again if necessary. (The foie gras may be sliced ahead of time, the
slices then wrapped airtight and refrigerated.)
</P>
<P>
   4. Heat a large nonstick saute pan over medium-high heat. Season
each slice of foie gras with salt and pepper, and working quickly,
slip the slices into the pan. If necessary, work in batches; do not
overcrowd the pan. Saute the slices for 1 minute, then turn and
saute 1 minute more.
</P>
<P>
   5. To serve, arrange one pear half in the center of each of six
warm plates. Top each half with slices of foie gras, and drizzle
with about a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar. Garnish each plate with
a sprig of thyme and a sprig of chervil; serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Fresh foie gras is available by mail order for $48.60 a
pound from D'Artagnan; (800) 327-8246.

RACK OF LAMB: SIMPLE, FESTIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (editors: recipe at end of article) 
(bl) 
By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Restaurants make such a show of rack of lamb that many people
assume there's some trick to cooking it. But all you have to do is
trim the excess fat and roast at extremely high heat. With really
good lamb, all you need for flavoring is salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is buying true lamb. In shopping for racks of lamb,
which are just unseparated rib chops, I've been offered a range
from just over a pound to more than 2 pounds. More weight means a
larger animal, and the larger the animal, the more it approaches
being mutton, not lamb; in heavier cuts, the meat and the fat both
taste gamier, and there's more of the latter. If you want mild
flavor, ask the butcher for a rack that weighs less than a pound
and a half. (You may need to order it.)
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants often offer a whole rack, six to eight ribs, as a
serving, but even a small rack will serve two people; a larger one
can feed three and sometimes four. For more, cook two racks at a
time; they will fit side by side in most roasting pans. I cut each
rack in half before roasting, which makes for slightly more uniform
cooking and relieves the busy host from having to separate the
individual servings at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   The roasting itself is child's play, although it will produce
smoke because of the high heat. I cut most of the way down between
the ribs so that more meat is exposed to intense heat and therefore
becomes crisp. (Frenching the ribs, or scraping the meat off the
bones to make them look neater, is counterproductive; the crisp
meat on the bones is one of the joys of rack of lamb.)
</P>
<P>
   The most reliable way to judge doneness is with an instant-read
thermometer; 125 degrees in the center will be nicely medium rare.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to try to improve on perfection, rub a teaspoon or
more of your favorite spice into the flat, fleshy side of the rack
before roasting. Or rub it with a mixture of two tablespoons of
olive oil, a clove of minced garlic, a cup of bread crumbs and
about half a cup of fresh parsley.
</P>
<P>
   You can also make a quick sauce by removing the lamb from the
pan to a warm platter, pouring off all but a tablespoon of fat and
setting the pan over high heat. Add a cup of good red wine or port
and cook, stirring and scraping, until the liquid is reduced to
about a third of a cup. Stir in any liquid that has accumulated
around the lamb, season to taste and spoon over the meat.
</P>
<P>
   CRISP-ROASTED RACK OF LAMB
</P>
<P>
   Total time: 30 minutes  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 racks of lamb, each about 1\ to 1{ pounds
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees. Strip most of the surface
fat from the lamb (your butcher may already have done this.) Cut
between the ribs, almost down to the meaty eye. Divide each rack in
half down the middle, sprinkle with salt and pepper and place in a
roasting pan.
</P>
<P>
   2. Roast for 15 minutes, then insert a meat thermometer straight
in from one end into the meatiest part. If it reads 125 degrees or
more, remove the lamb immediately. If it reads 120 degrees or less,
put the lamb back for about 5 minutes, no more. Remove and let sit
for 5 minutes; this will give you medium to medium-rare lamb on the
outer ribs, medium-rare to rare in the center. Cook a little longer
for more doneness. Serve, separating the ribs by cutting down
straight through them.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings

   MONEYTALK _ For many of us, the holidays bring spiritual
exaltation, emotional fatigue and economic prostration. We spend
everything we can. We charge the rest. We begin to wonder not how
we can ever get ahead in our financial lives but how we can just
catch up. The truth is, getting ahead is not that hard. What you
have to do to get started is to save money. That's not
overwhelmingly hard, either. What's hard is making yourself do it.

CULINARY INSPIRATIONS IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Haven't finished all your Christmas shopping? You are
in only a little worse shape than the French patissier Pierre Herme
and his frenzied team at Bouley Bakery here.
</P>
<P>
   Just days before Christmas, their buches de Noel, the
traditional French yule log cakes, are finally ready, as their
recipe took a lot longer than expected to fine-tune. The buche goes
on sale Wednesday and will be available through the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer Herme, a pre-eminent French pastry chef who had been
at Laduree in Paris, became associated with David Bouley. Christian
Michalak, who works for Herme at Bouley Bakery, has been overseeing
the buche production.
</P>
<P>
   The cakes come in four flavors: dark chocolate with a hint of
lemon, milk chocolate with hazelnuts and praline, coconut with
salted caramel and mango (iced to look like a bamboo log for those
who want a tropical Christmas), and chestnut flavored with malt and
black currants. The edible Christmas decorations are stylish and
the creamy filling balances against the cake with a touch of acid
fruit to cut the richness. The small size, which serves four to six
people, is $30; the large one, for eight to 10, is $45. To order:
(212) 964-8362.
</P>
<P>
   A Mist of Martini
</P>
<P>
   The new infant Misto, called Misto Martini, is an ideal stocking
stuffer. Unlike the full-size atomizer meant for olive oil, this
one is for spritzing vermouth to keep a martini dry. The Misto
Martini, $19.95 with a tiny funnel, is at Macy's Herald Square in
New York and at Complete Kitchen in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Fruitcake Substitutes
</P>
<P>
   If you like fruitcake for the fruit, not the cake, then the
dense panforte, a solid disk of fruit and nuts made in Siena since
the Middle Ages, is for you. At Balducci's, a one-pound panforte,
is $16.
</P>
<P>
   Also there is a handsome spice cake at Petrossian, a moist
applesauce version with pecans and raisins that serves 12 and is a
delicious far cry from fruitcake. It is $30 at the Petrossian
boutique.
</P>
<P>
   Cordon Bleu in U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Le Cordon Bleu, the chain of cooking schools with locations in
has added a base in the United States. It has entered into
partnership with the Career Education Corporation of Hoffman
Estates, Ill., to open schools in the United States. The
corporation runs 20 schools devoted to business, graphic design,
merchandising and cooking around the country and in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   More Sweet Potato Cakes
</P>
<P>
   Creative Cake Center, a family-run shop that turns out
ultra-creamy cheesecakes in plain and sweet potato flavors, and
other pies and cakes, has opened a store at Striver's Row in
Harlem. Plain cheesecakes are $20 for an 8-inch size and $40 for a
10-inch one; $5 extra for sweet potato.

KUGELHOPF: NOT A CAKE, NOT A BREAD, BUT ALWAYS JUST RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (fb)  
 By MIMI SHERATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Choucroute garni, with its pungent, pale blond sauerkraut
crowned by sausages and rose-pink cuts of pork, is the most famous
dish of Alsace. But Kugelhopf, a high, fluted, circular coffee
bread, is perhaps even closer to the hearts of Alsatians, as I
rediscovered on a late fall visit to that endearingly folkloric
French province on the Rhine. Kugelhopf beckons from every bakery
window the year round.
</P>
<P>
   Dusted with a snowfall of confectioners' sugar (preferably just
when purchased or before being served), kugelhopf is said to go
with everything at any time of day. Its soothingly neutral flavor,
with an even balance of sweet and salt, is as good with morning
coffee as with afternoon tea, evening wine or a midnight beer or,
at any hour, with a shot of icy clear eau de vie like kirsch,
mirabelle or framboise. It seems particularly right at this season,
for holiday brunches or between-meal snacking.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Soltner, the son of Alsace who cooked his way to fame at
Lutece, said that in olden days, a piece of kugelhopf with wine for
men and coffee for women was served before the lengthy marriage
ceremonies held in churches and synagogues. The bride's mother also
baked a kugelhopf for the priest, pastor or rabbi, the mayor and
schoolteacher, the midwife and neighbors, as tokens of good will in
case their help was ever needed.
</P>
<P>
   What was surprising as I talked kugelhopf with chefs and bakers
in Alsace was that something so totally benign could inspire such
heated controversy. First, there is the matter of spelling, with
the last syllable as ``hupf'' or ``hopf,'' preceded by ``kugel,''
``kougel,'' ``gugel'' or, in one edition of Larousse Gastronomique,
``sugl.''
</P>
<P>
   The origin is equally in dispute. In English we call the baking
pan that forms this specialty a Turk's-head mold, which is a clue.
The kugelhopf is as popular in Germany and Austria as it is in
Alsace, and one story says it originated in Vienna when the
Hapsburg forces defeated the Turks at the city's gates. In
celebration, Viennese bakers supposedly made a cake in the shape of
the sultan's turban.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, say Alsatians, who hold to another view partly explained
in ``The Lutece Cookbook,'' by Soltner. It seems that the Magi, or
Three Kings, were walking from Bethlehem to Cologne _ don't ask why
_ and were very tired when they got to the hilly wine village of
Ribeauville in Alsace. There they received hospitality from a
pastry chef, one Kugel. In appreciation, they later baked a cake in
the turban shape and gave it their benefactor's name. In honor of
that event, a Fete de Kugelhopf is held every June in Ribeauville.
It must also be noted that the word ``kugel,'' in German, means a
sphere or a ball, which might also have something to do with the
name.
</P>
<P>
   Other disputes center on the number of eggs and the amount of
sugar and raisins, although most bakers agree that for the driest,
smoothest crust and best-textured result, the baking mold should be
made of terra cotta glazed only on the inside. Throughout Alsace,
souvenir and kitchenware shops display every size and color of
kugelhopf mold, the most basic being the plain earthy brown and the
fanciest having richly colored glazes and hand-painted flowers or
other kitschy decorations. These days, metal molds are widely used,
especially because terra cotta is so fragile.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the truths about kugelhopf, know that the real McCoy is
much closer to bread than to cake, made with yeast, flour, very
little sugar and salt, small amounts of butter and, if it is a
``rich man's kugelhopf,'' a few eggs, an expensive ingredient not
found in a ``poor man's kugelhopf.'' One classic variation,
however, is the savory kugelhopf, enriched with bits of smoky bacon
and crunchy walnuts, which is meant to be served with aperitifs.
</P>
<P>
   Expecting a more golden, sweeter cake, and finding so many
samples of kugelhopf in Alsace to be dry and bland, I had just
about decided that I preferred the richer Austrian-German
interpretation, with its grated orange and lemon peel, candied
fruit and a hint of vanilla. Then I was lured into the elegant
Patisserie Jean at 6 Place de l'Ecole on a quiet, graceful square
in Colmar by a window display of heraldic kugelhopfs, along with
shelves full of intricate, luscious-looking pastries, petit fours,
small savories and jewel-like chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   Because Jean is strictly a patisserie with no table service, my
husband and I bought a small kugelhopf and had it in our hotel room
the next morning, along with room service cafe au lait for a
completely soul-satisfying breakfast. Sliced and spread with
unsalted butter and a touch of orange marmalade or apricot jam, it
was indeed a feast.
</P>
<P>
   Back in New York and thinking of that sensation, I searched for
local versions. Most walked like kugelhopf and talked like
kugelhopf but were more cake than bread, a triumph of form over
content.
</P>
<P>
   ALSATIAN KUGELHOPF Adapted from Patisserie Jean
</P>
<P>
   Time: About 2{ hours
</P>
<P>
   } cup warm milk
</P>
<P>
   \ cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2 envelopes yeast
</P>
<P>
   3{ cups flour, plus more for kneading and yeast
</P>
<P>
   \ cup kirsch, mirabelle or water
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup raisins, golden, black or a combination
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs, lightly beaten
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature
</P>
<P>
   8 to 10 blanched almonds
</P>
<P>
   Confectioners' sugar.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Combine 1/3 cup warm milk, 1 tablespoon sugar, salt, yeast
and 2 tablespoons flour in a bowl, and mix with fork to make a
paste. Cover, and let rise in a warm place until almost doubled in
volume, about 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Warm kirsch, mirabelle or water slightly and pour over
raisins in another bowl. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   3. In still another bowl, combine 3{ cups sifted flour, the
remaining sugar, milk and eggs with yeast paste. Mix to make a
soft, elastic, slightly sticky mass, adding more flour (no more
than { cup) or milk as needed. Using wooden spoon or fingertips,
work in all but 2 tablespoons butter.
</P>
<P>
   4. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured counter top and knead
vigorously, lifting and slamming dough down seven or eight times
until smooth and elastic. Strain raisins though a sieve, reserving
liquid, and work into dough along with liquid.
</P>
<P>
   5. Spread remaining butter generously around the sides and
bottom and into the crevices of an 8-inch kugelhopf mold,
preferably glazed earthenware. Arrange almonds in indentations in
bottom of mold. Gently shape dough into a roll 10 or 12 inches
long; arrange in a circle in mold. Tap mold down firmly on counter
top so dough settles evenly. Cover and let rise in a warm spot
until dough doubles and is level with rim of mold, about 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   6. Heat oven to 450 degrees. Place mold on center rack and bake
10 minutes. Lower heat to 350 degrees and bake 40 to 45 minutes,
until kugelhopf shrinks slightly away from sides and a slim knife
or skewer inserted in cake comes out clean and dry. Cool in mold 5
minutes, then turn out onto a rack and cool at least 4 hours before
cutting. For best flavor, do not cut for 6 hours.
</P>
<P>
   7. Dust liberally with confectioners' sugar just before slicing.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: About 8 servings.

STEW, A HEARTY INSULATION FOR WINTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA KAFKA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even when the weather is warmer than usual, there's something
about December that makes me think of stew. I'm a confirmed soup
aficionado, but this is the time of year when a stew, in all its
density, seems the best defense against even the threat of winter.
</P>
<P>
   When I think of stew, though, I'm not contemplating the
beef-and-carrot standard. A big pot of vegetables can cook into a
superb stew. Short ribs, normally served solo, can be converted
into a fine stew, too, with or without the bones.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to stews lies in the thickening, the same element
that sets a braise apart from a brothy soup. Stews may contain more
solids, or the savory liquid in which they cook may be thickened.
Either way, there is that satisfying density.
</P>
<P>
   Many times, the thickening is added at the beginning of a stew,
as when chicken parts or chunks of meat are tossed in seasoned
flour before being browned. The flour binds with the cooking fat to
make a more substantial broth.
</P>
<P>
   In other instances, the stew is thickened toward the end of
cooking, when a paste of cornstarch and cold water, called a
slurry, is added and simmered briefly. A mixture called a beurre
manie, made by kneading together equal parts of butter and flour,
will also thicken a stew.
</P>
<P>
   But there are sneakier ways. Ingredients like potatoes are
natural thickeners: as they cook, they soften and break down to
dissolve throughout the liquid. Barley will also act as a thickener
by absorbing liquid as it cooks; it continues to thicken if the
stew is allowed to sit and is then reheated.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the gelatin that seeps out of bones as they stew.
As we know from Jell-O, gelatin thickens anything. Okra is the
vegetable kingdom's version of gelatin; as it cooks, it releases a
viscous substance that will bind together the most disparate
ingredients. That's the principle of gumbo, whose name stems from
the Bantu word for okra. In gumbo, a hodgepodge of ingredients
hangs together thanks to okra.
</P>
<P>
   Okra works especially well in the vegetables-only stew recipe at
right, which evokes the Caribbean more than Cajun country in its
seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   It and the other recipe here, for a short-rib stew, are
especially straightforward and easy. There are only a few tips to
note. To season the vegetable stew, add the lime juice before
adjusting the seasoning and adding more salt. Because the stew is
so thick, with barely any liquid, the rice should be cooked
separately and added at the end. The rice also makes the whole dish
taste less spicy, but those with fragile taste buds can reduce the
amount of hot pepper.
</P>
<P>
   If the short ribs are cut in overlarge sections, there will be
fewer than 12 pieces. If so, cook them as described and remove the
meat from the bones before dividing it evenly among the bowls.
</P>
<P>
   WINTER SHORT-RIB STEW
</P>
<P>
   Total Time: 2 hours 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   3 pounds short ribs, cut across and between the bones to form 12
pieces about 2 inches square (The butcher will do the
cross-cutting.)
</P>
<P>
   6 cloves garlic, smashed and peeled
</P>
<P>
   3 cups diced canned or sterile-pack tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   4 1-by-4-inch strips orange zest
</P>
<P>
   1 1-by-3-inch strip lemon zest
</P>
<P>
   } cup pearl barley
</P>
<P>
   1 pound green string beans, tips and tails removed
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons kosher salt, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 large bulb fennel, stalks removed, cut in half, cored and cut
into thin strips
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon coarsely chopped fresh oregano
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon coarsely chopped fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   1 10-ounce package frozen baby lima beans, defrosted in a sieve
under warm running water
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper, to taste.
</P>
<P>
   1. Place a rack in the middle of the oven, and heat oven to 500
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   2. Place the short ribs in one layer in a medium roasting pan,
and roast for 25 minutes. Turn the pieces, add the garlic, and
roast for 15 minutes more.
</P>
<P>
   3. Remove the ribs to a tall, narrow stockpot. Spoon the fat
from the roasting pan, and pour any juices over the bones.
</P>
<P>
   4. Place the roasting pan on top of the stove over medium heat,
and add 1{ cups water. Bring to a boil, scraping any browned bits
off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Pour this liquid
over the bones.
</P>
<P>
   5. Add the tomatoes, 2 cups water, the bay leaf, 2 pieces of
orange zest and the lemon zest. Cover the stockpot, and bring to a
boil. Uncover, lower the heat, and simmer for 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   6. Stir in the barley, the string beans and 2 cups water. Cover,
and bring to a boil. Uncover, lower the heat, and simmer for 30
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   7. Occasionally poke the string beans down into the liquid. Add
2 teaspoons salt, and simmer for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   8. Skim the fat. Add the fennel and the herbs. Bring the pot to
a boil. Lower the heat, and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the remaining
salt, the lima beans, two strips of orange zest and 2 cups water.
</P>
<P>
   9. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer for 5 minutes.
The meat should be falling off the bones.
</P>
<P>
   10. Remove the meat and the bones from the stockpot. Place two
pieces of meat (with or without the bones) in each of six bowls,
and divide the vegetables and liquid evenly over them.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 hearty servings.
</P>
<P>
   VEGETABLE STEW
</P>
<P>
   Total Time: 1 hour 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1 large yellow onion, diced into \-inch cubes
</P>
<P>
   3 medium cloves garlic, smashed, peeled and coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 medium bunches Swiss chard (about 1} pounds), washed well, the
leaves separated from the stems, the stems cut across in \-inch
slices and the leaves cut across in \-inch-wide strips
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   1 large pinch ground allspice
</P>
<P>
   2 medium dried hot red peppers, crumbled
</P>
<P>
   1 medium butternut squash, peeled, seeded and cut into 1-inch
cubes (about 4 cups)
</P>
<P>
   2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes (about
3 cups)
</P>
<P>
   1 pound okra, trimmed and cut across into \-inch rounds
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon kosher salt, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons plus { teaspoon lime juice or to taste
</P>
<P>
   4{ cups white rice cooked in salted water.
</P>
<P>
   1. In a medium stockpot, melt the butter over medium-low heat.
Stir in the onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes.
Stir in the garlic, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes,
or until the onion and garlic are translucent.
</P>
<P>
   2. Stir in the Swiss chard stems and cook, stirring
occasionally, for 3 minutes. Add 3 cups water, the bay leaf,
allspice and hot peppers. Cover, and bring to a boil.
</P>
<P>
   3. Stir in the squash and sweet potatoes. Cover, and return to a
boil. Lower the heat, and simmer, covered, for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   4. Add the Swiss chard greens and the okra. Cover, and return to
a boil, pushing the greens and okra down into the liquid once in a
while to aid the wilting.
</P>
<P>
   5. Lower the heat slightly, cover the pot, and boil gently,
stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, or until the Swiss chard and
the okra are cooked through. There will be very little liquid left
at the end, so be careful not to let it burn.
</P>
<P>

   The New York Times News Service calls your attention to the
following religion features moved during the last week.
</P>
<P>
   For retransmission of these stories, call 888-346-9867.
</P>
<P>
   RABBI-FUTURE-COX _ The next generation of Jews will be
volunteers. The volunteer corps will wrestle with God in an
emerging Jewish life driven by compassion and justice rooted in
authentic spiritual experience. And it will shape a Judaism that
energetically recruits converts, recognizes women fully, welcomes
and ordains practicing homosexuals, presides over same sex unions
and embraces intermarried couples. Rabbi Alexander Schindler thinks
that's what the future holds.
</P>
<P>
   KADDISH-BOOK-REVIEW-NYT (Undated) _ In March 1996 after his
father's death, Leon Wieseltier found himself in synagogue, like
generations of Jewish sons before him, reciting the Kaddish. Unlike
most others in his situation, though, Wieseltier _ the product of
an Orthodox upbringing (though no longer traditionally observant),
a former graduate student of medieval Judaism, now the literary
editor of The New Republic _ was struck by how little he knew about
the ritual he was performing so faithfully even as he realized it
was taking over his life. Stirred by his ignorance and his natural
``bookishness,'' he decided to take upon himself an additional
discipline of grief, which was to search out the history and
meaning of the Kaddish, the mourner's prayer. By David Stern.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-COLUMN-NYT (Undated) _ Early generations of Christian
missionaries from Europe and the United States often fared poorly
in the popular media. They have been depicted in novels and films
as arrogant or, worse, tools of colonial adventurers. This week,
however, the work of missionaries, specifically in education,
received a word of praise from a source widely regarded as one of
the late 20th century's moral leaders, President Nelson Mandela of
South Africa. By Gustav Niebuhr.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-JONES-COLUMN-TEX (Undated) _ One of my favorite
Christmas songs has a verse that begins, ``Do you see what I see _
a star, a star, shining in the night with a tail as big as a kite,
with a tail as big as a kite.'' The song about the Star of
Bethlehem leading the Magi to the place of Christ's birth is one
example of the fascination with the bright light the Gospel of
Matthew says pinpointed the location of a humble manger almost
2,000 years ago. Was the heavenly display a comet with a long tail,
perhaps even Halley's comet? Or was it an exploding star or an
unusual conjunction of planets? By Jim Jones.
</P>
<P>
   MOSES-MANORMYTH-TEX (Undated) _ The name of Moses resounds
through Western civilization, echoing ancient themes of freedom,
faith and the founding of a nation. His image _ bearded and
sometimes horned (because of a tradition grown out of a
mistranslation) _ has inspired great geniuses to paint and chisel.
Words attributed to him have been known and recited by nearly every
person who has lived in Western civilization since Christianity
became the dominant religion. Even in 1998, Moses is deemed worthy
of a mass-market animated motion-picture feature, ``The Prince of
Egypt,'' which opened yesterday after much media fanfare. But did
he really exist? By Wayne Lee Gay.

SANTA SUITS UP TO FIT THE TRADITIONS OF MANY COUNTRIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American idea of Santa has taken hold all over the world _
the roly-poly red-suited one has become a popular figure in
countries as far-flung as Brazil, the Philippines and Ghana. But
many countries have developed their own versions of Santa _ or
maintained other holiday figures _ that better fit their own
traditions. Here's a multinational seasonal sampler:
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   NORWAY: Variation on Santa: ``Julenisse,'' a gnomelike creature
who lives under the barn floor (for those who live on farms).
``Julenisse'' delivers presents to the children in person on
Christmas Eve. ``He's a very charming guy,'' says Eivind Homme,
press counselor at the Norwegian Embassy in Washington. But if
you've been bad, watch out.
</P>
<P>
   Special Christmas decorations: Children make baskets out of
paper to hang on the Christmas tree, which is not lit until
Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Special Christmas foods or snacks left out for Santa: Homme's
family will serve pork ribs, Christmas sausage, spiced cabbage and
cloudberries with cream.
</P>
<P>
   Families leave ``Julenisse'' a large portion of porridge with
butter on Christmas Eve, or else, legend says, he'll wreak havoc in
the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   Popular gifts: ``Just like in the U.S., computer games and so
on,'' Homme says. Sports equipment, such as skis and skates, are
also very popular.
</P>
<P>
   Stocking stuffers: Norwegians fill stockings with sweets the
night of Dec. 23.
</P>
<P>
   When season starts: On the first Sunday in Advent, when families
light the first of four candles. Nobody decorates much before Dec.
23.
</P>
<P>
   How much spent: Homme quotes a recent study that puts the figure
at $133 per child.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE: Variations on Santa: ``Pere Noel'' is much like the U.S.
version of St. Nick, except he is not married. He does have little
helpers called ``Pre Fouettard,'' who keep track of which little
boys and girls have been good or bad.
</P>
<P>
   Special Christmas decorations: Most French are Catholic and
place a creche, or Nativity scene, next to their Christmas tree,
says Veronique Lhemann, the press attache at the French Consulate
in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Special Christmas foods or snacks left out for Santa: Turkey
with chestnuts for the midnight meal on Christmas Eve, called ``La
Reveillon.'' Truffles and champagne are popular during the
holidays, as is lobster, foie gras and oysters. The French do not
leave treats out for Pere Noel's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Stocking stuffers: Instead of stockings, everyone in the family
leaves out a pair of shoes overnight, which are filled with
goodies.
</P>
<P>
   Popular gifts: Spice Girls and Babar merchandise. Adults may
wait and exchange gifts on New Year's.
</P>
<P>
   When season starts: Early December.
</P>
<P>
   How much spent: Lhemann estimates $60 per child.
</P>
<P>
   AUSTRALIA: Variation on Santa: Despite Christmas falling during
the Australian summer, Santa wears the same winter get-up as he
does here. His sleigh, however, is pulled by six kangaroos, or
``boomers,'' as Aussies call them. Some people have suggested
replacing Santa with the Australian mascot Swagman, a country
bumpkin who wears an outback-type hat and spends most of the year
under Ayers Rock, where it's nice and cool.
</P>
<P>
   Special Christmas decorations: Real Christmas trees are in short
supply, but otherwise the Australians decorate like Americans do.
</P>
<P>
   Special Christmas foods or snack left for Santa: Christmas
dinner often consists of cold salads and seafood, along with fruit.
``Follow that with a couple Foster's or some Australian wine and a
bit of a snooze,'' suggests Sandi Logan, public affairs counselor
with the Australian Embassy in Washington. Families near the coast,
he says, often take their dinner to the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Kids put out chocolate milk and biscuits for Santa _ and carrots
for the boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Popular gifts: Whatever is big in the United States. ``It's
certainly not true that every kid gets a jar of Vegemite,''
stresses Logan. Because the school session begins again at the end
of January, school supplies are popular gift items.
</P>
<P>
   Stocking stuffers: The lack of fireplaces in Australia precludes
hanging stockings, but sweets such as Jaffas, a chocolate ball
covered in an orange coating, and Cherry Ripes, a cherry coconut
candy with chocolate coating, are popular.
</P>
<P>
   When season starts: The second week of December.
</P>
<P>
   How much spent: ``Too much,'' Logan declares.
</P>
<P>
   ITALY: Variation on Santa: The Italian Santa, La Befana, is an
old, poor woman who carries a broom. La Befana refused to accompany
the Wise Men to Bethlehem (she was sweeping her doorstep when they
stopped by) and later regretted her decision. Now she travels
endlessly looking for the baby Jesus and bearing gifts for the good
children of Italy. La Befana arrives on Jan. 6, the Feast of the
Epiphany, delivering gifts at night while children sleep. Where
there are chimneys in the north, La Befana enters homes through the
chimney, but in Rome, she delivers gifts through the vent over the
kitchen stove, says Dona De Sanctis, director of research at the
National Italian American Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Special Christmas decorations: Families burn yule logs and place
wrapped gifts in an Urn of Fate. The ``presipio,'' an Italian
nativity scene, is the base of a pyramidlike structure called a
``ceppo.'' Shaped like a Christmas tree and decorated with
ornaments, the ``ceppo'' supports small gifts of fruit, candy and
presents.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Italians have adopted the tradition of
Christmas trees and also exchange gifts on Dec. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Special Christmas foods or snacks left out for Santa: Christmas
Eve dinner, ``Il Cenone,'' is a meatless meal that includes
spaghetti and anchovies and fish dishes.
</P>
<P>
   La Befana receives no special snack.
</P>
<P>
   Popular gifts: Cell phones! Also, when Italians visit friends
this time of year, they traditionally bring ``panettone,'' a large
sweet, bread; and bottles of ``spumante'' sparkling wine.
</P>
<P>
   When season starts: The Catholic Italians begin religious
observances eight days before Christmas. ``What signaled Christmas
for us,'' says De Sanctis, who hails from Naples, ``is when the
shepherds came into the city wearing traditional garb: sandals with
lambskin leggings and felt hats. They walk through the streets,
playing bagpipes.''
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY: Variations on Santa: Christmas Man, or
``Weihnachtsmann'' in German, first shows on Dec. 6, the
traditional date of the Feast of St. Nicholas. He brings good
children sweets and returns with other gifts on Christmas Eve.
Often a relative will don the traditional red-and-white outfit and
pass out the goodies. In some parts of the country, Santa is
accompanied by ``Knecht Rutrecht,'' who punishes bad children, and
``Christkindl,'' who rewards good children. The former is a scary
character in dark heavy clothing, whereas the latter is a beautiful
figure dressed in white robes and shiny accessories (including
wings and crown). Kriss Kringle, by the way, derived from the
American mispronunciation of Christkindl.
</P>
<P>
   Special Christmas foods or snacks left out for Santa: For
Christmas Eve dinner, goose and German dumplings. Throughout the
season, Germans indulge with ``gluehwein,'' a red wine drink spiced
with sugar, cinnamon and orange; and ``Crist stollen,'' a cake with
raisins and spices.
</P>
<P>
   Popular gifts: Stuffed animals, dolls, electronics, cashmere,
sports equipment, according to The Week in Germany, a newsletter
published by the German Information Center.
</P>
<P>
   When season starts: Shopping season officially begins on the
first Advent Saturday, several weeks before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   How much spent: German consumers will spend a projected $11.8
billion on gifts this Christmas, says a recent Week in Germany
story.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO: Variations on Santa: Santa has yet to infiltrate most
Mexican households, where children direct their wish lists either
to ``El Ni$o Dios,'' the Holy Child, or to ``Los Reyes Magos,'' the
Three Kings. The Holy Child brings gifts on Christmas Eve, whereas
the Magi deliver theirs on Jan. 6, ``Dia de Los Reyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Special Christmas decorations//celebrations: Mexicans celebrate
the season with ``Las Posadas,'' nine days of candlelight
processions beginning Dec. 16. Young people re-enact the Holy
Family's search for a place to rest in Bethlehem by walking
door-to-door and singing traditional songs. At the end of the
evening, children break a pinata.
</P>
<P>
   Nativity scenes are the focal point in Mexican homes. Elaborate
ones may occupy an entire room and include ponds, trees and strings
of lights. In Mexico City, Christmas trees have become part of the
celebration, placed next to the Nativity scene.
</P>
<P>
   Special Christmas foods or snack left out for Santa: Following
Christmas Eve mass, families head home for dinners of tamales,
atole (corn gruel), turkey in mole sauce, roast leg of pork or
bacalao a la vizca! (Biscayan cod). ``Noche Buena'' is a dark beer
brewed specifically for the holidays, and ``Rosca de Reyes'' is a
crown-shaped sweet bread decorated with candied fruits.
</P>
<P>
   Popular gifts: On Dec. 24, children often receive clothing, says
Jesus Vargas, press attache at the Mexican Consulate in Dallas. The
Magi normally bring dolls, bicycles and sports equipment.
</P>
<P>
   When season starts: Dec. 16.
</P>
<P>
   How much spent: It can be a very large portion of one month's
income, Vargas says.

WORLDWIDE LAWS OF LIFE:
 GREAT PEOPLE REFUSE TO BE VICTIMIZED BY CIRCUMSTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Sir John Templeton, the Tennessee-born billionaire and founder
of the Templeton funds, built his fortune on his legendary ability
to perceive value that others overlooked. In his column, he urges
us to recognize the value of spirituality in life.)
</P>
<P>
   (``Reverse the word evil and you have the word live.'' --Phinius
P. Quimby)

Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative NIRDI
RELIS in New York at (800) 972-3550 or (212) 499-3333, or fax her

</P>
<P>
   Why do bad or evil things seem to happen to good people? That
question has perplexed artists, philosophers, and religious
thinkers throughout the ages.
</P>
<P>
   When accident, disease, financial misfortune, or other personal
tragedy happens to the morally responsible, it piques our sense of
justice, especially when those with less-than-honorable behavior
often seem to live problem-free lives, at least on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be only fair that those upstanding ones should be
rewarded with an existence unmarked by tragedy? Instead, we hear
repeatedly how some innocents are victimized while some oppressors
go free.
</P>
<P>
   What flaw in the order of the universe, some people ask with no
small amount of bitterness, allows misfortune to plague the
existence of good people?
</P>
<P>
   A story is told about a young seeker who trekked over
treacherous mountain trails to find a particular teacher who, he
had been told, could answer any question he might present. After
several days of walking, asking for directions from local villages,
looking for clues, and depending on little more than intuition, the
pilgrim found the one he sought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Master,'' the earnest young man immediately asked, ``How can I
know what is Real?''
</P>
<P>
   The sage was silent for a few moments, but not because he needed
to think. Then he spoke, ``Young man, if you want to know what is
Real, then you must realize what is the nature of the mind that you
ordinarily use to look at your life.''
</P>
<P>
   The student was somewhat puzzled, ``But how can this
understanding show me what is Real?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because,'' the teacher explained, ``the mind is the slayer of
the Real!''
</P>
<P>
   What did the wise teacher mean? How can the mind slay that which
is Real? Is not the Real impervious to any threat? And what is the
mind anyway?
</P>
<P>
   No, the mind cannot mar one iota of Truth. The Truth is eternal
and unassailable. However, our perceptions of Truth are vulnerable
and easily distorted by the web of ignorance, spun by the spider of
the rational mind.
</P>
<P>
   In the fullness of time, the pain of personal catastrophe can
often give way to new understanding and inner growth. That which is
called ``evil'' may be typically experienced by the victim as a
destructive reversal of fortune that causes unnecessary suffering.
For example, an honest, hard-working political candidate is
undermined by her opponent's slanderous remarks to the media. A
star football quarterback is made a paraplegic in an accident
caused by a drunk driver. These two examples of gratuitously evil
acts may invite the beginning of transformation for the victims.
From these tragedies can emerge the possibility of a deeper, more
meaningful life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evil,'' transformed and reversed, often can indeed spell
``live.'' The passage of a good person through a painful experience
can mobilize inner resources and open doorways into a new and more
expanded and useful life.
</P>
<P>
   In an Old Testament story, Joseph was cast into a pit by his
jealous brothers and abandoned to die. He was saved by traders who
sold him into Egyptian slavery, where again he incurred the wrath
and jealousy of some people he met. He was jailed, once more an
innocent victim; but instead of destroying Joseph, the prison
experience served as a new beginning. He learned to channel his
dreams toward constructive ends, and eventually he was able to
serve the Egyptian people.
</P>
<P>
   To his brothers who sought his forgiveness, Joseph granted it,
telling them, ``You meant evil against me; but God meant it for
good'' (Genesis 50:20).
</P>
<P>
   Seeming evil can multiply and triumph when good people become
resentful and bitter over misfortunes, but, just as surely, evil
may be often overcome when they find it within themselves to
transcend despair, forgive ignorance, heal betrayals, love
everyone, and go on with a life of spiritual growth. In fact, as
was true with Joseph, such transcendence may be the hard road good
people can travel to become great people.
</P>
<P>
   Great people refuse to be victimized by circumstance. Instead,
they often use even the most traumatic event as a springboard for a
creative and helpful response to life. From his wheelchair, the
paralyzed quarterback mobilized his leadership skills to help
handicapped children. The victimized politician spoke her simple
truth, and thus gave an example in humility to millions.
</P>
<P>
   Those who grow in stature through adversity have learned to
reverse the word EVIL to the word LIVE.

REISSUING THE CLASSIC BOOK ON A CLASSIC DRINK 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the early 1980s, a time before Lounge, and the martini
looked to be on its last legs. Undeterred, a martini lover and
classics professor named Lowell Edmunds wrote a treatise on his
favorite drink, exploring its multiple meanings, explaining its
ambiguous messages and tracing its intricate history.
</P>
<P>
   His book, ``The Silver Bullet,'' was a landmark, the first
serious work on America's greatest cocktail, but for years _ the
very years in which the martini has regained its former glory _ it
has been out of print.
</P>
<P>
   Now, revised and updated, Edmunds's labor of love lives again,
outfitted with a new title, ``Martini, Straight Up: The Classic
American Cocktail'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   As before, Edmunds puts the martini on the cultural couch,
teasing out its contradictions. Drawing on Hollywood movies, novels
and journalism to illustrate his points, he looks deep into the
famous conical glass and sees seven messages (the martini is urban
and urbane, for example, not rural or rustic) and four ambiguities
(the drink is both sensitive and tough) concealed within. ``Its
pleasure, which is not voluptuous but astringent,'' he writes,
``can only be expressed by oxymoron: sensuous coldness, opulent
dryness, mysterious clarity, alluring purity.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmunds seems to have unearthed every reference to the martini
since its creation sometime in the 1870s, and by researching recipe
books from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, he has
painstakingly reconstructed the actual history of a cocktail
swaddled in myth.
</P>
<P>
   He tracked down the first shipment of French vermouth to the
United States (from Noilly Prat, in 1851). He got the lowdown on
Sherwood Anderson's unfortunate death-by-toothpick after drinking a
martini. He compiled a list of every martini cartoon ever to appear
in The New Yorker. The martini is the last word on cocktails. This
book is the last word on the martini.

</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-LAW-FIRM _ WASHINGTON _ If there is a quick solution to
President Clinton's jeopardy in the Senate, it may emerge from the
offices of Verner Liipfert, widely considered the capital's most
influential law firm. The star-studded roster of partners and
associates includes former Sens. Bob Dole and George Mitchell _
already involved in censure discussions _ and former Gov. Ann
Richards of Texas. (Dart, Cox News Service).

   IMPEACH-LIST _ The five most powerful lobbying firms in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   BAXTER-COLUMN _ Washington _ It came down to that fateful
morning, when it seemed history would finally take precedence over
news. That was the way things felt Saturday, briefly, before Rep.
Bob Livingston got up to announce his resignation and the anxieties
of the moment came rushing back to elbow history aside one more
time. That chaotic, angry moment, when the Democrats began their
chant for Livingston to resign, delaying him for a few seconds from
doing just that, encapsulated as well as any the anguish in a
capital which has come to seem more like a dysfunctional family at
the verge of a breakdown than a two-party government doing the
business of the people. At year's end the toll could be expressed
in this way: Two articles of impeachment, and a permanent scar on
the president's record. (Baxter, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   NATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   KIOSK _ As Georgia struggles to balance the increasing cost of
its burgeoning Corrections Department, it is trying a new approach
with people on probation: trust. In metro Atlanta and in Clarke
County, the state is allowing its best probationers to work on the
honor system by reporting to a machine, instead of a person. The
probationer goes to a kiosk, usually in a state building, inserts a
fingerprint card and then responds electronically to a series of
question, such as whether he/she has recently used drugs. Although
the program is in its second year, the state has no accurate
measure of its success because the states tracks probation
recidivism on a three-year cycle. However, the chief probation
officer expects little problems with the 3,000 or so people who
choose this route. Because there is an extra $10 monthly fee for
this type of probation reporting system, the people who do it have
to volunteer. There is reality here, tho. Corrections officials
readily admit that the machines, also being tested in a few other
cities nationwide, can not replace occasional personal contact.
(Cook, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 15.

<P>
   PILFEREDMAIL _ ATTENTION VIRGINIA, COLORADO EDS _ Mail pilfered
over the years at Hartsfield is finally delivered, following the
thief's trial. One piece of mail is a Christmas card, designed by a
young Virginia man for the hospital that had treated him for cystic
fibrosis. Sent by his parents after his death in 1992, it arrived
this month at an aunt's house in Colorado, where it had special
meaning: Her kids have recently left the house, and the letter gave
her a sense of connection. (Harris, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   TRITIUM _ For the first time in the history of nuclear weapons,
the U.S. government will allow a civilian nuclear power plant
produce tritium, the trigger ingredient for nuclear warheads. In a
move expected to stir protest from several environmental groups,
the Energy Department on Tuesday chose the Tennessee Valley
Authority's Watts Bar and Sequoyah plants as the nation's first
commercial producer of the bomb material. The other candidates were
the Energy Department's Hanford Site in Washington and Savannah
River Site in South Carolina. React from TVA and environmental
leaders. (Harmon, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

proceeds from bingo, tobacco and tourism. Their opponents are the
state and federal agencies that rule what remains of the

   FILM AND VIDEO

<P>
   CITY-OF-ANGELES-VIDEO (Undated) _ On July 4, a month after
``City of Angels,'' the motion picture, began its inevitable
journey toward videotape, ``City of Angels,'' the soundtrack,
became the No. 1 album on the Billboard chart. Today, more than
five months after the movie disappeared from the theaters, ``Music
From the Motion Picture `City of Angels' '' remains firmly
entrenched among Billboard's top 40 albums. Having earned
quadruple-platinum status (four million units sold) and spawned two
hit singles (``Uninvited'' by Alanis Morissette and ``Iris'' by the
Goo Goo Dolls), it has become the best-selling record to be
released in 1998. By Andrew Essex.
</P>
<P>
   HURLYBURLY-FILM (Undated) _ David Rabe's scathing 1984 play
``Hurlyburly'' about the volatile lives of a group of Hollywood
bottom-feeders, will open Friday in New York and Los Angeles for a
weeklong run to quality for the Oscar race, before a nationwide
release in January. Made a year ago on a puny budget of $4 million,
a sum that no doubt would have had the movie's jaded industry types
in stitches, ``Hurlyburly'' features a powerhouse ensemble that
includes Sean Penn, Kevin Spacey, Meg Ryan, Anna Paquin, Chazz
Palminteri, Robin Wright Penn and Garry Shandling, playing an
assortment of shallow, self-absorbed, cocaine-snorting,
hair-trigger-tempered opportunists alternately indulging in and
resisting their basest impulses. By Peter Marks.

   ROBBINS-DANCE (Undated) _ Among the titans, Jerome Robbins was

   KIRCHSCHLAGER-MUSIC (Undated) _ Ms. Angelika Kirchschlager, at
33, has enjoyed a seemingly meteoric rise in the often ruthless
world of operatic singing. Even more noteworthy, her success comes
at a time when opera houses are flush with excellent mezzos. Yet
thanks in large part to her rapport with audiences, Ms.
Kirchschlager stands out. On Thursday evening, she will make her
New York Philharmonic debut at a New Year's Eve concert to be
conducted by Kurt Masur and telecast live on PBS. By David

   CLASSICAL-MUSIC-SALES (Undated) _ Executives from the major
classical-music recording companies often speak about their work
with a sense of mission. But it is hard to discern much mission at
this time of market glut, as the major labels seem to flail about,
desperately trying to figure out what will sell. The glut comes not
just from further reduplications of the standard repertory by
heavily promoted new performers but also from countless reissues of
almost anything, and gimmicky collections like ``The Best of
Tchaikovsky'' or ``Ten Tenors in Prayer.'' By Anthony Tommasini.

   KENTE-CLOTH-ART (Undated) _ Kente cloth's iconic powers are both
considerable and quite possibly singular. For centuries, Asante and
Ewe royalty in Ghana have worn gloriously colored kente of fine
silk on state occasions. The garments have lent a grandeur to the
festivities, and more important, they have been a means for
chieftains to proclaim their authority and wealth. Small wonder
that kente has become an almost universal totem of black identity.
``Wrapped in Pride: Ghanaian Kente and African-American Identity,''
an exhaustive exhibition at the Newark Museum organized by Doran H.
Ross, the director of the Fowler Museum of Cultural History at the
University of California, Los Angeles, in collaboration with Anne
Spencer, the curator of Africa, the Americas and the Pacific at the
Newark Museum. For the uninitiated and aficionados alike, its 185
examples of traditional and modern kente offer insight into the
fabric's history, evolution and cultural significance. The exhibit
remains on view in Newark through Jan. 3 and then travels to the
Fowler Museum, the National Museum of African Art in Washington and
the Detroit Museum of African-American History. By Fletcher

<P>
   LEVINE'S DVORAK _ The year's striking musical moments often came
during events ostensibly about other things. James Levine's Met
Orchestra concert at Carnegie Hall in mid-November advertised
Milton Babbitt's new piano concerto, but it was a performance of
Dvorak's G major Symphony that made the jaw drop and the heart beat
faster. Here was a locus of points: the sophistication of a
big-time orchestra, the dead-on contact with late 19th-century
style, and a simple sympathy with the dancing and singing of rural
Central Europe.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BEETHOVEN IN CLEVELAND _ The listener went to Cleveland early in
October to hear Charles Ives' newly cobbled ``Emerson'' Concerto
for piano and orchestra but came away with a performance of
Beethoven's ``Eroica'' Symphony that spoke of collaboration onstage
and a sense of community in the audience. Christoph von Dohnanyi
and the Cleveland Orchestra provided a kind of informed fervor not
often encountered in the concert world. The audience at Severance
Hall gave every indication of appreciating just what was happening
before it.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PICKER'S `EMMELINE' _ ``Emmeline'' at the New York City Opera at
the beginning of April gave us a new American opera that might last
awhile. Tobias Picker's modest yet substantial work rises blessedly
above a long line of recent mediocrities from this country, each
having promised much and delivered less. There is a Shaker-like
quality to ``Emmeline,'' a piece that sang handsomely and held
together nicely in Francesca Zambello's sparse production. Patricia
Racette sang the title role.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LIGETI IN LOS ANGELES _ Gyorgy Ligeti's Requiem in late April in
Los Angeles gave New York a lesson in what festivals, large and
small, are meant to do. This big and frightening choral work was
the centerpiece of Esa-Pekka Salonen's brave series with the Los
Angeles Philharmonic based on Ligeti's music. The Requiem is both
chaste and raucous, with a cartoonish approach to the liturgy not
inappropriate to our times. Reacting to a strong performance, a big
audience swallowed hard and took it all in.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CELEBRATING CARTER _ Europeans have carefully choreographed
their 90th-birthday tributes to Elliott Carter, but I like the rich
and disorganized rush of concerts coming from every side of New
York's musical community. Speculum Musicae presented a Carter
program at the Miller Theater in late October, looking back to the
imposing Double Concerto of 1961 but also offering such airy,
light-filled new chamber pieces as ``Luimen'' for six instruments.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CELEBRATING GERSHWIN _ Eurocentric symphony orchestras are
making hardy, if halting, attempts at the Gershwin centenary. But
one of the most interesting pockets of celebration was a weekend
conclave in mid-March at the Library of Congress in Washington.
There practitioners, scholars, family members and friends spent
three days with music of Gershwin and contemporaries like Vernon
Duke. Some of the papers dragged, but Dick Hyman, Alan Feinberg,
Michael Feinstein, Bolcom and Morris, and others were there to pep
things up.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BROOK'S `DON GIOVANNI' _ Mozart's ``Don Giovanni,'' continuously
in the operatic repertory since its premiere just over 200 years
ago, found a friend in the director Peter Brook, whose simple yet
carefully considered production at Aix-en-Provence, France, in July
fixed attention where it belonged. There was a young, strong cast
on an outdoor stage and a correspondingly good band of student
players in the pit, conducted by Claudio Abbado.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KREMER'S VIVALDI _ If it is fashionable to trash Vivaldi's
ubiquitous ``Four Seasons,'' Gidon Kremer and his Kremerata band
reminded listeners of this music's great power and originality with
a concert in early August at Avery Fisher Hall. Every familiar
movement was rethought, sometimes not to my liking but performed
with a concentration and skill that removed these pieces from the
status of elevator music, where they have languished for too long.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AX AND KREMER _ Two items from the ambivalence department:
First, Emanuel Ax in early August at Avery Fisher Hall playing
Chopin's F minor Concerto on an 1840 Broadwood piano with the
Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment. It may have been the wrong
instrument for us today, but what sensitive, graceful musicianship
it was. Remember, too, Astor Piazzolla's tango opera ``Maria de
Buenos Aires,'' again with Kremer and his Kremerata in early
October at the Majestic Theater of the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
Overwhelmed by its own literary ornateness, the work is
nevertheless a window onto the exciting no man's land between
popular and classical cultures.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MET PRODUCTIONS _ We expect so much of the Metropolitan Opera
that when its vast resources fail us, we remember. Reviving
Offenbach's ``Contes d'Hoffmann'' in February was a gratifying
success, but one mourns the sometimes misdirected assets of this
fall's ``Nozze di Figaro'' and the anti-opera self-indulgence of
Franco Zeffirelli's new ``Traviata.'' The Robert
Wilson-meets-``Lohengrin'' experience in March had its opening
night problems, too. Is the labor-intensive Wilson style wrong for
a big, busy repertory house? It may well be.

AS TRIAL LOOMS, CLINTON'S LEGAL EXPENSES CONTINUE TO ESCALATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the White House legal team preparing for an
expected Senate trial, the cost of President Clinton's defense is
continuing to escalate.
</P>
<P>
   Any hopes the president harbored of holding his outstanding
legal defense bills to the $4.5 million he now owes were dashed
Saturday when the House approved two articles of impeachment and
sent them to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   A vote against impeachment wouldn't have ended Clinton's legal
bills because Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation of
him continues until Starr issues a final report. But the price tag
becomes inestimably higher with the matter going to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The legal representation Clinton receives from White House
Counsel Charles Ruff and Special Counsel Gregory Craig is
taxpayer-funded. But the bills of his private lawyer, David
Kendall, are not.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall, of the high-profile Washington law firm of Williams &AMP;
Connolly, bills his clients fees that are in the $400-an-hour
bracket, standard for top-flight legal talent here.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hired Kendall in 1993 at the beginning of his troubles
over his investment in the Whitewater land development scheme.
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, appointed in 1994, failed to
build a Whitewater-related case against Clinton but struck pay dirt
in January of this year as the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal
blossomed.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, Ruff's task is defending the office of the
president while Kendall's assignment is to defend Clinton as an
individual. But often the lines are blurred.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 20, for instance, it was Kendall who grilled Starr
before the House Judiciary Committee on Starr's conduct of the
Lewinsky investigation probe. Kendall provoked Starr by accusing
him of leaking secret grand jury testimony to the media. Starr
denied the charge and accused Kendall of instigating leaks.
</P>
<P>
   But on Dec. 8 and 9 as committee Republicans began drafting
articles of impeachment, it fell to Craig and Ruff to handle
Clinton's last line of defense. Craig told lawmakers Clinton had
been ``evasive, incomplete, even maddening'' but insisted he had
not committed perjury.
</P>
<P>
   And Ruff argued that although Clinton's behavior with Lewinsky
was objectionable, he should not be impeached because it did not
``subvert our system of government.''
</P>
<P>
   A White House official, who asked not to be identified, said
that while Kendall ideally works on Clinton's private matters and
Ruff watches over Clinton's role as president, ``they work together
on many of these issues because they involve the president in both
capacities.''
</P>
<P>
   Payment of Clinton's legal fees has fallen to two successive
trust funds. The first, created in 1993, was hampered by a federal
Office of Government Ethics ruling that it could not solicit funds
since it had been set up by Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It also got caught up in Justice Department and congressional
investigations of the financing of Clinton's 1996 re-election
campaign. Yah Lin ``Charlie'' Trie, a former Little Rock restaurant
owner and Clinton friend, gave the fund $639,000 in checks. Worried
about the source of the donations, fund officials declined to
accept the checks.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the fund were called to testify before
congressional committees and a federal grand jury, forcing the fund
to spend money on its own legal fees. The fund closed last Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Trie has pleaded innocent to charges that he obstructed the 1997
Senate campaign finance investigation and is awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   The second fund was set up last February by former Sen. David
Pryor, D-Ark., in a way that permitted overt fund-raising. Donors
have included several Hollywood celebrities including Barbra
Streisand, Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall has collected close to $2 million from both funds.
</P>
<P>
   As of August, the last reporting period for the Clinton Legal
Expense Trust _ the second fund _ Kendall had submitted bills for
an additional $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bennett, Clinton's lawyer in the now-settled Paula Corbin
Jones sexual harassment lawsuit, has outstanding bills of $2
million, bringing Clinton's current total debt for his legal
defense to $4.5 million. The fund has raised $2.2 million from
17,000 contributors. Its next report is due in February.

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; A caviar connoisseur is someone who relishes the various. Bursting
between the tongue and the roof of the mouth, caviar never tastes
the same. Its flavor varies from fish to fish, region to region,
season to season. That is part of its allure.
</P>
<P>
   But this year the variety is less alluring than it is baffling.
The world of caviar _ from the harvesting to the selling to the
buying and tasting _ has degenerated into chaos.
</P>
<P>
   The market is glutted with stale, substandard caviar shipped
before more stringent import regulations took effect in April,
although fresh, pristine caviar imported since then is also
available. For the first time, a significant amount of caviar is
being imported from China. Add the growing amount of farm-raised
caviar from California, Russia and France, and you get an array of
choices that can be thrilling _ and confusing.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the confusion is mostly a symptom of transition.
The new regulations from the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species, or Cites (the acronym is pronounced
SIGHT-ease), seek to protect the threatened sturgeon by regulating
its harvesting and the taking of its caviar. By April 1999, people
in the industry say, the substandard caviar predating the
regulations will be gone. Labeling will be clearer, quality will be
more consistent and prices will reflect the grade of the eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, buying caviar this season is complicated, and a
mistake can be costly: Beluga is going for as much as $150 an
ounce. ``What's so great about this?'' is a perceptive response to
the taste of most caviar being sold in New York right now.
</P>
<P>
   And if all that weren't enough, last week three distributors
were indicted on federal charges of smuggling illegal caviar into
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   News like this compounds the confusion that has surrounded
caviar since the breakup of the Soviet Union, the source of most
caviar. Before, a central authority controlled the caviar industry
and protected the sturgeon stock and, ultimately, the consumer.
Today the Caspian Sea waters that were regulated are worked by
fishermen from two independent republics (Kazakhstan and
Azerbaijan) and two Russian regions (Astrakhan and Degestan),
producing caviar whose taste and quality are completely
unpredictable. Overfishing and poaching are rife, as are unskilled
handling and processing of the precious roe.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the American trade embargo against Iran, no Iranian
caviar can be legally imported into the country, but some caviar
dealers are nevertheless using the Iranian grading system as a
marketing tool. Triple-zero beluga was the best, double-zero second
best, single-zero runner-up; A-rated osetra was top-grade, B
something less. Sevruga was graded 1 (best) and 2 (second best).
But those grades are not reliable indicators of quality. Even the
Russian term malossol, which means ``little salt,'' is a marketing
tool; the saltiness varies from tin to tin.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to anarchy on the banks of the Caspian, there are
the newcomers. China has developed a caviar industry that is
shipping tons of caviar to the United States this year. Fishermen
along the Mississippi River are landing hackleback sturgeon, and
the roe from those fish is being sold as caviar, along with that of
paddlefish from the Great Lakes. Stolt Sea Farms in Sacramento,
Calif., has developed some excellent caviar from farm-raised
sturgeon, as have five tiny sturgeon farms in France and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Some retailers are trying to wedge these new varieties into the
three traditional classes of caviar _ beluga, osetra and sevruga _
thus diminishing the meaning of those terms. Other retailers are
coining names like Royal Black for the new caviars, which may be
poetic but say little about the taste, quality or provenance of the
roe.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to clarify the meaning of the traditional terms,
and to assess the most serious contenders among the new types of
caviar, I recently convened a panel of six tasters to compare 16
types.
</P>
<P>
   To compose the panel, I surveyed a dozen of Manhattan's top
chefs for the caviar tasters and purveyors they most trusted, and
combined their suggestions with my own experience buying caviar
over 15 years in Manhattan. The panelists were Eric Ripert, chef of
Le Bernardin; Eve Vega, president of American operations for
Petrossian, which has offices in Paris and New York; Hossein
Aimani, owner of Paramount Caviar in Manhattan; Rod Mitchell, an
owner of the Browne Trading Company in Portland, Maine; Florence
Fabricant, who writes about food for The New York Times, and
myself. We sampled wholesale specimens, which are often repackaged
under a retailer's own name.
</P>
<P>
   We found that 1998 is not a good year for sevruga, the scarcest
caviar right now, but is fairly good for osetra and beluga, the top
types, from Kazakhstan. The quality of Astrakhan caviar is
inconsistent. And we were stunned to find the Sterling caviar,
which comes from farm-raised sturgeon in California, comparable to
the best osetra.
</P>
<P>
   But the main object of the tasting was not to rank the samples _
indeed, we tasted only the best caviar that is available. Our
effort was to identify the characteristics of the main types of
caviar being sold in New York City today, and to compile a sort of
Baedeker of caviar _ a guide to buying, selecting and enjoying the
season's ultimate indulgence.
</P>
<P>
   Buying Techniques
</P>
<P>
   Would you buy a diamond without seeing it? Don't buy caviar
without sampling it first, and don't be intimidated _ it is
customary to ask for a taste. And if you don't like what you taste,
don't buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh caviar should glisten; upon close inspection, the eggs
should be luminous, pert-looking and consistent in size and color.
If they look noticeably different, different grades of caviar may
have been mixed together and the offering inaccurately labeled and
overpriced. Smashed or misshapen eggs are likely to have been
mishandled or frozen.
</P>
<P>
   Caviar should not smell fishy. The grains should be firm, but
not rubbery or tough. Hard grains usually mean that the caviar has
been pasteurized, which destroys its integrity.
</P>
<P>
   For higher-priced caviars, the purveyor should be able to show
you a copy of his Cites permit, which includes a detailed account
of where the fish was harvested and processed. (The fish will be
identified by its Latin name _ Huso huso instead of beluga, for
instance). If you are spending top dollar, you are paying for
freshness; you want evidence that it was harvested last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Tasting Techniques
</P>
<P>
   Use small spoons made of bone or mother-of-pearl, which do not
affect the flavor of caviar. (Most metal spoons impart unpleasant
metallic notes; even plastic is preferable.)
</P>
<P>
   Before tasting, inhale the aroma; there should be very little.
Then slip the caviar into your mouth. As it sits on your tongue,
pull a little air into your mouth, close your eyes and, without
hesitation or any attempt at delicacy, crush the eggs by forcing
them against the roof of your mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate taste should be oceanic. The middle sensations
should evoke earthier things: fruit, nuts, even truffles. The final
sensation should be a slight brininess, tinged with the sort of
coppery nuance of a Belon oyster. The overall impression is the
balance of the disparate sensations in the mouth. This final
equation lingers; don't rush to a conclusion.

   The Varieties
</P>
<P>
   BELUGA (Huso huso, $50 to $150 an ounce). The king of the 27
varieties of sturgeon that produce edible roe, beluga has a snub
nose and the appearance of a pit bull. It can grow 20 feet long and
weigh a ton. It takes 15 to 20 years to reach maturity, lives about
150 years and can contain up to 15 percent of its body weight in
roe.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions in the Caspian Sea, where temperatures can become
tropical in the day and freezing at night, seem to produce the most
succulent beluga.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, beluga caviar is pale to steel gray; the eggs are
the largest, and perhaps the most tender. The texture is buttery,
and the flavor is the most delicate of all caviar; it should taste
less salty than oceanic. Beluga can have hints of nuts or fruit and
can finish with a subtle copper taste or a delicate herbaceous
flavor, depending on its origin.
</P>
<P>
   This year's beluga from Kazakhstan, a seat of the caviar
industry from the days of the czars, has a nice bead that tends to
be quite large. The flavor is very buttery; the texture creamy; the
overall impression sultry and deep.
</P>
<P>
   Beluga from Astrakhan can be the most pronounced in flavor, yet
most subtle of all. But production difficulties have made the
supply inconsistent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Russian beluga is almost always from the old Guryev fishery and
is milder and mushier this year than beluga from Kazakhstan or
Astrakhan. While the fruitiness is pronounced, it tastes more
acidic than delicate.
</P>
<P>
   Beluga from the Sea of Azov is very mixed in quality this year.
It tends to have a small egg, closer to black than gray. While it
can have a mild, creamy taste, the muddy flavors of the egg tend to
overpower all other nuances.
</P>
<P>
   Beluga from the Amur River, which forms a part of the
Russian-Chinese border, is not impressive. The eggs vary and tend
to be smallish and very separate, with a greenish hue. They have a
sharp, herbaceous taste that is not unpleasant, but not buttery,
either. If the taster were not expecting the rich creaminess of a
Caspian beluga, Amur River caviar might represent a whole new
tasty, affordable world.
</P>
<P>
   OSETRA (Acipenser gueldenstaedti, $14.50 to $75 an ounce). The
fish has an elongated jawbone like a swordfish and can grow to 7
feet long and about 400 pounds. It reaches maturity in 12 years,
lives about 40 years and can contain nearly 3 pounds of roe. Chefs
tend to prefer osetra to beluga: the egg is firmer, and the color
varies from gold to dark brown. Osetra is rich and nutty tasting.
</P>
<P>
   Kazakhstan has produced a large quantity of osetra this year. It
has a large, light-colored bead, often tortoise-shell in tone, with
a rich hazelnut flavor and a clean, smooth, oceanic taste.
</P>
<P>
   Russian osetra from Guryev comes in two distinct types this
year. One has a smaller bead, with a pronounced briny flavor and
tart finish. It tastes peppy and young, but doesn't have its usual
voluptuousness. The other has a big, voluptuous bead, a tawny color
and a rich, almondy taste.
</P>
<P>
   Osetra from the Amur River is very mixed in quality but has been
steadily improving as China's processing improves. Caviar labeled
Amur River most likely comes from China, and like the beluga, the
osetra grade is typically fresh and sprightly. It's a nice,
easy-eating caviar _ good but very different from its Caspian Sea
cousins.
</P>
<P>
   FARMED AMERICAN STURGEON (Acipenser transmontanus, $35 an
ounce). Domestic caviar has come into its own this year. Virtually
all of it comes from Stolt Sea Farms in Sacramento, whose top grade
is called Sterling caviar and is comparable to Kazakhstan osetra in
both quality and price. The bead is small and firm, with a lively
pop, a subtle hint of the sea and a deep, pronounced hazelnut
flavor. The color ranges from violet to a nearly cream-colored
gold, touching all the steely and tawny points between.
</P>
<P>
   SHIP (Acipenser nudiventris, $12 to $23 an ounce). The ship, a
Caspian Sea sturgeon, is being most closely monitored because its
numbers are dwindling. It is traditionally mixed with osetra or
sevruga. This year, with mixing illegal, some ship caviar is being
sold on its own. It falls between osetra and sevruga in appearance,
but has a flavor like that of sevruga _ intense, but with an odd
and indefinable musty, dusty aftertaste. The bead tends to be quite
dark and small.
</P>
<P>
   SEVRUGA (Acipenser stellatus, $7 to $25 an ounce). This is the
smallest of the three sturgeon that produce luxury caviars, at a
little over 5 feet and 70 pounds. It matures in seven years but
produces precious little caviar, an average of a little over 11
pounds per fish. Because it matures young, sevruga sustained the
most damage from overfishing after the breakup of the Soviet Union
and is therefore the most likely to be mixed with ship caviar, or
roe from American hackleback or paddlefish.
</P>
<P>
   The best comes from Russia this year: tiny, glittering, nearly
black eggs with a characteristically intense flavor, deep on the
briny side, with a dark, dangerous sexiness as opposed to the
languid sensuality of both beluga and osetra. Very, very little
good sevruga is available.
</P>
<P>
   KALUGA (Huso dauricus, $15 to $25 an ounce). This sturgeon is
harvested from the Amur River; if it is landed on the eastern
banks, it is Chinese; on the western banks, Russian. The eggs are
firm, large and beautiful; they seem to glow a deep olive green and
tortoise. Their taste is less breathtaking: lighter, fresher and
younger than Caspian beluga. Kaluga shares part of its Latin name
with beluga and is often mislabeled either beluga or osetra,
depending on the size of its egg.
</P>
<P>
   PRESSED CAVIAR (About $15 an ounce). A jammy confection made of
broken beluga, osetra and sevruga, this can be very good indeed. If
you plan to cook with it _ in an omelet, as a topping for potatoes,
as a filling for crepes or even blini _ pressed caviar is an
economical option. Unfortunately, very little good-quality pressed
caviar is available this year.

 &HT;    Sweet Apple's like intriguing friend
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ She came to work in the yard, and I waved her off on
some pruning she had in mind. I didn't want her to strip the old
log cabin of the bushes and trees that held it to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this old house,'' I remarked, unnecessarily, I thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do!'' she yelped. ``I never heard you say that before. I
thought you lived in it because you were . . . well, trapped. You
have it; you're stuck with it.''
</P>
<P>
   After she left, I brooded over that statement for a while. A
house is like a person. Maybe you should say you love it once in a
while. I must have forgotten. Looking at the log walls and
listening to the rain on old time-silvered shakes and tin, didn't I
ever say, ``Sweet Apple, I love you''?
</P>
<P>
   For, of course, it's true. A television interviewer leaving my
house once turned and said, ``You'd just as soon live here as in a
real house?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a real house!'' I protested, and the TV man gallantly
hid his chagrin and departed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I've lived in all kinds of houses _ big two-story houses
with stairs, apartments, fishing camps, one especially loved
sawmill shanty. I guess I've loved them all, but this one is best.
</P>
<P>
   A house is like a person: It's not very interesting if it
doesn't have a past. A new house? I might admire the conveniences
and, my Princeton friend Ann Aldron assures me, I would be crazy
about the spacious closets.
</P>
<P>
   But you can make do without most conveniences if you've never
had them, and my Gainesville(Ga.) friend Margaret Castleberry
solved the closet problem for me. She, too, lived in an old house _
with a church pew on the front porch and a whiskey still in the
back yard, as she told everybody. It lacked closets so she stacked
up stuff and covered it with a clean sheet. An efficacious system,
I have found.
</P>
<P>
   I love my cabin's history. It was built in 1842. It must have
seen some of Sherman's men go through to Roswell(Ga.), not
considering it important enough to burn. It housed a big family,
some of whom went on to become valued Atlanta citizens. When it was
no longer needed as a home, it became a schoolhouse and a lot of my
old-time neighbors learned to read there. I found in an old trunk a
1914 contract for a young man named Charlie Stow to teach there _
``a white school in Milton County,'' for $25 a month, ``if it is in
the county treasury.'' Both the county and its treasury were
short-lived, and I believe the young man died in World War I. I
think of him often and hope that some of his scholars did him proud
with their book learning.
</P>
<P>
   The floors slant to the west, there are cracks in the walls that
admit vines and winter winds, and it creaks and whispers in the
night. I love the land it stands on, once cultivated by good
farmers, who planted trees that bore fruit and shaded me for a long
time after I stopped being a newcomer from the city.
</P>
<P>
   We made accommodation with the jet planes that shatter the
pre-dawn quiet, and I finally did the same with the thunder and
lightning that sometimes explode over rooftop and chimney and
rattle the windows. The cabin has been on this little hill longer
than any storms and tumults, I tell myself, pulling up a quilt. And
when harsh winds blow it might tremble a little, reminding me that,
unlike newer, sturdier houses, it has a heart.
</P>
<P>
   But when firelight and candlelight lay fingers of gold on the
old walls, my heart lifts with love for the place, which has
sheltered me and most of the people I love through the years.

 &HT;    Many answer the call for TBS Trumpet gala
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TV's Bryant Gumbel, opera diva Jessye Norman and R&AMP;B master
Smokey Robinson will be among those feted in January during TBS'
seventh annual Trumpet Awards, honoring African-American
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Also getting a posthumous award will be Frank Sinatra, who
championed the careers of such entertainment greats as Sammy Davis
Jr., Diahann Carroll, Ella Fitzgerald and Nat ``King'' Cole.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Gumbel, Norman and Robinson, official Trumpet
honors will be given to Ford Motor Co. staffer Matel Dawson Jr.,
whose more than $500,000 in cash contributions to universities
includes a $100,000 donation to Louisiana State University, and to
Eunice W. Johnson, producer and director of Ebony Fashion Fair, the
world's largest traveling fashion show.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Sinatra will accept her late husband's award for
humanitarian service. Dorothy Height, chairwoman of the Leadership
Conference on Civil Rights, will receive the Living Legend Award,
and U.S. Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) will get the Pinnacle Award.
</P>
<P>
   New to the Trumpet Awards will be the Circle of Athletes,
honoring sports figures for positive impact. The 1999 trio of
winners are Jackie Joyner Kersee, baseball's John ``Buck'' O'Neil
and football coach Eddie Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   The awards, started in 1993 by TBS corporate consultant Xernona
Clayton, will be held Jan. 11 at an invitation-only dinner at CNN
Center's Omni Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   TBS will televise the event at 7 p.m. Feb. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Hosts and scheduled presenters include Debbie Allen, NAACP
President Kweisi Mfume, model Tyra Banks, gospel singer Kirk
Franklin, radio host Tom Joyner and actresses Tia and Tamera Mowry.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years the Trumpet Awards have risen in importance and
become a glitzy, star-studded affair. Past recipients include
Muhammad Ali, Maya Angelou, Kenneth ``Babyface'' Edmonds, Evander
Holyfield, Whitney Houston, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Quincy Jones,
Coretta Scott King, Gladys Knight, Justice Thurgood Marshall, Terry
McMillan, Rosa Parks, Gen. Colin Powell and Andrew Young.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 21 when the awards are televised, TBS will also air nine
films about African-Americans, including 1972's ``Sounder,''
``1967's ``In the Heat of the Night,'' 1989's ``Glory,'' 1997's
``Miss Evers' Boys,'' 1995's ``The Tuskegee Airmen'' and 1978's ``A
Woman Called Moses.''
</P>
<P>
   SEEN AND HEARD
</P>
<P>
   Sounds of the season with Robert Shaw
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of the new _ and better _ entrants in this year's
decking of holiday programming is GPTV's ``Atlanta Symphony:
Christmas With Robert Shaw'' (9 tonight E.T. on WGTV ).
</P>
<P>
   Taped last season, this is a 90-minute national show for PBS and
one in particular that metro Atlantans should be proud of. After
all, Shaw is probably this city's greatest treasure. One wonders
why Andrew Young speaks in the show's prologue mainly about Shaw's
place in America in classical music. Frankly, Shaw is of world
importance in choral music.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually no one anywhere leads singers toward angelic heights
like this charming, bespectacled, gray-haired man.
</P>
<P>
   On this show, he commands the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, the
Atlanta Symphony Chorus, the Morehouse College Glee Club and the
Gwinnett Young Singers through a thoroughly enjoyable stitching of
secular and sacred music, including a segment of Vivaldi's ``Four
Seasons'' and, of course, Handel's ``Messiah.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the show's greatest moments: a perfectly placed camera
capturing an energized Shaw with clenched fist as he coaxes
eloquent female voices through Kopylov's ``Heavenly Light'' and the
choruses' brisk rendition of the difficult ``This Little Babe''
with the Gwinnett Young Singers.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Morehouse's Glee Club throws in a show
stopper: Olatunji and Whalum's ``Betelehemu.'' It's a rousing
rendition surpassing this group's performance of the same song on
that other great GPTV special, ``Carols From Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   If you can't catch ``Christmas With Robert Shaw'' tonight, it
will be repeated on WGTV and WPBA in the coming days, but perhaps
no better time than Thursday when WGTV bookends it at 8 p.m. with
the stunning ``Carols'' at 7 p.m. and GPTV's solid new holiday show
``Jessye Norman: A Holiday Homecoming'' at 9:30 p.m. .
</P>
<P>
   Grades: A- (``Christmas With Robert Shaw''); A- (``Carols From
Atlanta''); B+ (``Jessye Norman: A Holiday Homecoming'')
</P>
<P>
   CNN ratings rise
</P>
<P>
   CNN more than tripled its 1998 average ratings during coverage
of the Clinton crisis and impeachment. Overall coverage of the
Clinton crisis for the year scored a 1.8 rating, well above CNN's
24-hour average rating of 0.5. Live coverage involving
Clinton-Lewinsky peaked Aug. 17 for the president's speech, which
garnered a 7.3 rating, or roughly 5.4 million households. CNN also
says its average 24-hour household viewership grew from 332,000 in
1997 to 396,000 this year.

WORLDWIDE LAWS OF LIFE:
 GREAT PEOPLE REFUSE TO BE VICTIMIZED BY CIRCUMSTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

of the Templeton funds, built his fortune on his legendary ability
to perceive value that others overlooked. In his column, he urges
us to recognize the value of spirituality in life.)

</P>
<P>
   Why do bad or evil things seem to happen to good people? That
question has perplexed artists, philosophers, and religious
thinkers throughout the ages.
</P>
<P>
   When accident, disease, financial misfortune, or other personal
tragedy happens to the morally responsible, it piques our sense of
justice, especially when those with less-than-honorable behavior
often seem to live problem-free lives, at least on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be only fair that those upstanding ones should be
rewarded with an existence unmarked by tragedy? Instead, we hear
repeatedly how some innocents are victimized while some oppressors
go free.
</P>
<P>
   What flaw in the order of the universe, some people ask with no
small amount of bitterness, allows misfortune to plague the
existence of good people?
</P>
<P>
   A story is told about a young seeker who trekked over
treacherous mountain trails to find a particular teacher who, he
had been told, could answer any question he might present. After
several days of walking, asking for directions from local villages,
looking for clues, and depending on little more than intuition, the
pilgrim found the one he sought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Master,'' the earnest young man immediately asked, ``How can I
know what is Real?''
</P>
<P>
   The sage was silent for a few moments, but not because he needed
to think. Then he spoke, ``Young man, if you want to know what is
Real, then you must realize what is the nature of the mind that you
ordinarily use to look at your life.''
</P>
<P>
   The student was somewhat puzzled, ``But how can this
understanding show me what is Real?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because,'' the teacher explained, ``the mind is the slayer of
the Real!''
</P>
<P>
   What did the wise teacher mean? How can the mind slay that which
is Real? Is not the Real impervious to any threat? And what is the
mind anyway?
</P>
<P>
   No, the mind cannot mar one iota of Truth. The Truth is eternal
and unassailable. However, our perceptions of Truth are vulnerable
and easily distorted by the web of ignorance, spun by the spider of
the rational mind.
</P>
<P>
   In the fullness of time, the pain of personal catastrophe can
often give way to new understanding and inner growth. That which is
called ``evil'' may be typically experienced by the victim as a
destructive reversal of fortune that causes unnecessary suffering.
For example, an honest, hard-working political candidate is
undermined by her opponent's slanderous remarks to the media. A
star football quarterback is made a paraplegic in an accident
caused by a drunk driver. These two examples of gratuitously evil
acts may invite the beginning of transformation for the victims.
From these tragedies can emerge the possibility of a deeper, more
meaningful life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evil,'' transformed and reversed, often can indeed spell
``live.'' The passage of a good person through a painful experience
can mobilize inner resources and open doorways into a new and more
expanded and useful life.
</P>
<P>
   In an Old Testament story, Joseph was cast into a pit by his
jealous brothers and abandoned to die. He was saved by traders who
sold him into Egyptian slavery, where again he incurred the wrath
and jealousy of some people he met. He was jailed, once more an
innocent victim; but instead of destroying Joseph, the prison
experience served as a new beginning. He learned to channel his
dreams toward constructive ends, and eventually he was able to
serve the Egyptian people.
</P>
<P>
   To his brothers who sought his forgiveness, Joseph granted it,
telling them, ``You meant evil against me; but God meant it for
good'' (Genesis 50:20).
</P>
<P>
   Seeming evil can multiply and triumph when good people become
resentful and bitter over misfortunes, but, just as surely, evil
may be often overcome when they find it within themselves to
transcend despair, forgive ignorance, heal betrayals, love
everyone, and go on with a life of spiritual growth. In fact, as
was true with Joseph, such transcendence may be the hard road good
people can travel to become great people.
</P>
<P>
   Great people refuse to be victimized by circumstance. Instead,
they often use even the most traumatic event as a springboard for a
creative and helpful response to life. From his wheelchair, the
paralyzed quarterback mobilized his leadership skills to help
handicapped children. The victimized politician spoke her simple
truth, and thus gave an example in humility to millions.

ANGELIKA KIRCHSCHLAGER: COMMON-SENSE MEZZO AND STAR IN THE MAKING
</HEADLINE>
 David Mermelstein lives in Los Angeles and writes about the arts.  
 (For release Sunday, Dec. 27) 
(bl) 
By DAVID MERMELSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an era when charm is a virtue too much lacking in the arts,
it is no wonder that the Austrian mezzo-soprano Angelika
Kirchschlager has caused heads to turn. She is, after all, a
beguiling presence. With her sparkling persona and fresh good
looks, she has delighted audiences throughout Europe and the United
States. Yet her success stems from more than just beauty and
breeding. She is a singer with the right stuff: a sumptuous, rather
light-toned voice, which she uses intelligently and judiciously.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kirchschlager, at 33, has risen rapidly in the often
ruthless world of operatic singing. Even more noteworthy, her
success comes at a time when opera houses are flush with excellent
mezzos. Yet thanks in large part to her rapport with audiences, Ms.
Kirchschlager stands out.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday evening, she will make her New York Philharmonic debut
at a New Year's Eve concert to be conducted by Kurt Masur and
telecast live on PBS. But Cassandras who fear that fame has arrived
too suddenly for Ms. Kirchschlager need not worry. In choosing her
repertory, she shows an instinctive flair for what is right. A
mezzo whose voice is more in the mold of a young Anne Sofie von
Otter than a Jennifer Larmore, Ms. Kirchschlager mixes
adventurousness with common sense when selecting projects.
</P>
<P>
   During the Mostly Mozart Festival at Lincoln Center last summer,
she took part in a concert version of Mozart's ``Idomeneo'' in a
seldom-heard reworking by Richard Strauss, which is sung in German
rather than Italian.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very strange,'' she said of the project at the time.
``It's 100 percent confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Her performance was anything but, earning praise from critics
and a rapturous response from the audience. But it was especially
her appearance at the festival's opening-night concert, a few days
earlier, that inspired unusual accord among the critics. Both The
New York Times and the Daily News described her singing of Mozart
arias and Strauss songs as first rate.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard Schwarz, the festival's artistic director, conducted on
those occasions and recently described Ms. Kirchschlager's
performances as ``tremendous.'' She displayed a ``warm, rich,
beautiful sound,'' he said, but her greatest gift was a natural
musicianship that ``just feels right.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz also conducted Ms. Kirchschlager's American operatic
debut, as Octavian in Strauss' ``Rosenkavalier'' at the Seattle
Opera in 1997. A trouser role requiring both tonal beauty and
winsomeness, the part is becoming widely associated with Ms.
Kirchschlager, who in September made her Geneva Opera debut as
Octavian. Soon, she may find herself in the company of such
renowned interpreters of the role as Christa Ludwig and Frederica
von Stade.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz, having spent two months with Ms. Kirchschlager as she
rehearsed and performed the part, called her ``the most
extraordinary Octavian I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's her role,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers now have the chance to judge for themselves. The
first half of the Philharmonic program consists of excerpts from
``Der Rosenkavalier,'' with Ms. Kirchschlager joined by the
sopranos Deborah Voigt, as the Marschallin, and Noemi Nadelmann, as
Sophie. Ms. Kirchschlager sings an aria from Johann Strauss'
operetta ``Wiener Blut'' in the second half of the program, which
she called ``light with some substance.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a formula she tends to favor. In November, in Lausanne,
Switzerland, she portrayed the Composer in Richard Strauss'
``Ariadne auf Naxos'' for the first time, and she has just finished
her first Hansel in Humperdinck's ``Hansel und Gretel'' in Graz,
Austria. (She will perform the role at the Seattle Opera in 2001,
with Schwarz conducting.)
</P>
<P>
   But Mozart remains Ms. Kirchschlager's favorite composer, and
not only because they were both born in Salzburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fascinating thing about his music is that you have a view
up to heaven,'' she said recently. ``It's perfect. It's so simple,
so direct. He shows us how mankind is.''
</P>
<P>
   Her Metropolitan Opera debut, as Annio in Mozart's ``Clemenza di
Tito'' last year, was acclaimed by critics, and she will return to
the Met in 2002 to sing the amorous page Cherubino in ``Le Nozze di
Figaro,'' another trouser role in which she has been justly
celebrated. She has also sung two roles in ``Cosi Fan Tutte,''
Dorabella and, perhaps more surprising, the saucy maid Despina.
</P>
<P>
   A budding opera star needs to keep her repertory growing, and
Ms. Kirchschlager is trying hard. She took on six new roles last
year and three this year. She will tackle two more next year:
Valencienne in Lehar's ``Merry Widow'' and Silla in Pfitzner's
``Palestrina.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kirchschlager is careful in choosing her parts, never
tackling anything that might compromise her voice, but she is
determined not to become predictable. She insists on artistic
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just do Verdi your whole life, even if you are
fantastic, it would be boring,'' she said. ``The fascinating thing
is to experience new things.''
</P>
<P>
   In time, Ms. Kirchschlager affirmed, she would like to be
involved in premieres of new works, but no such projects loom. She
is content for now to add Kurt Weill's hard-edged ``Seven Deadly
Sins'' to her repertory; she will sing it for the first time in
April, in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Kirchschlager, there are myriad connections to be made
in music. ``When you do Weill, you profit in Mozart,'' she said.
``And when you do folk songs, you profit in Schubert.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Ms. Kirchschlager has adopted an expansive approach in
the opera house and on the concert stage, she has followed a
different course in the recording studio. Unlike many of her peers,
she has a tiny discography, though she signed an exclusive contract
with Sony Classical in 1995. She has recorded no operas and only
one recital album, a well-received disk of songs by Korngold,
Mahler and Alma Mahler.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although conventional wisdom holds that a singer cannot have too
many CDs before the public, Ms. Kirchschlager will not record her
second Sony album, a potpourri of songs inspired by motherhood,
until the spring. ``The Seven Deadly Sins'' is to be recorded in
2000, the centenary of Weill's birth, and Ms. Kirchschlager hopes
sometime to record songs by Wolf, Berg and Schoenberg as well as
French repertory.
</P>
<P>
   She has no qualms about her spare recording schedule. In fact,
she argues that the absence of a glut may make listeners appreciate
her minuscule catalog all the more. ``I don't mind how many records
other singers bring out in a year,'' she said. ``It doesn't affect
me.''
</P>
<P>
   That determination to go her own way artistically is a
reflection of Ms. Kirchschlager's confident, sensible demeanor,
says her friend the pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet, who has
accompanied her in some 20 recitals during the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is such an anti-diva person,'' Thibaudet said. ``She is
utterly natural, and she sings the way she is. Her whole approach
is very organic, the way music should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Thibaudet, who sometimes travels great distances just to hear
Ms. Kirchschlager perform, says that working with her is a constant
pleasure and that the two of them easily find common musical
ground. ``I probably shouldn't tell people this, but most of the
time, we rehearse a program just once, because we never fight,'' he
explained. ``Also, that leaves an incredible spontaneity to the
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kirchschlager lives in Vienna with her husband, Hans-Peter
Kammerer, a baritone, and their son, Felix. Although she and
Kammerer will appear together in a production of ``The Merry
Widow'' in February at the Vienna State Opera, Ms. Kirchschlager
finds working with him nerve-racking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so nice to sing together,'' she said, ``because each
of us has to worry about the other as well as ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Given her sweet, unaffected personal manner, to say nothing of
her obvious and abundant talents, it is hard to imagine that Ms.
Kirchschlager has a dark side. Yet a secret lurks beneath her
friendly bearing and glowing tan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it would not be wise for me to do something like
crossover, but I love that stuff,'' she said, almost guiltily.
Then, as if unable to stop herself, she gushed, ``I would love to
sing with Michael Bolton.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, nobody's perfect.

VIEWERS TUNE IN FOR CLINTON VOTE 
BROADCASTERS OF TOMORROW 
SOMETHING DIFFERENT FOR KIDS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Ga., N.Y.)   (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The impeachment vote on Saturday morning, one of the most
extraordinary news days of at least the decade, drove up viewing
levels for virtually every television news outlet that covered it,
but not to the extent that some other major news events of recent
vintage did, including the death of the Princess of Wales, or the
verdict in the O.J. Simpson trial.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures released Tuesday by CNN, the impeachment
events on Saturday had the highest ratings of any single day in
1998. Fox News and MSNBC, the other all-news cable channels, also
reported sharply higher ratings on Saturday, including the highest
single day ever in the two-year history of the Fox News channel.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC's ratings were the fourth-highest in its 2 1/2 years of
existence, the highest draw being the funeral of Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Increased numbers were also reported in the nation's 44 largest
cities for all the broadcast networks that covered the voting
process on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's network coverage was complicated by CBS' obligation
to cover the Jets-Bills football game, which drew ratings that
dwarfed those of any channel covering the impeachment vote. CBS'
football number, which surpassed 12 million viewers at its peak,
more than doubled the ratings for NBC and ABC, and may even have
beaten out those for all the channels in impeachment coverage at
that time, 2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   CNN, for example, averaged about 1.8 million households for the
day's coverage, with MSNBC at just under 400,000 households and Fox
at about 275,000 households. Added to NBC and ABC, that still
probably would not add up to more than 12 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   But CNN's coverage did reach a high point at 4:15 when the
president spoke. Then the channel was reaching about 5.3 million
households.
</P>
<P>
   That is about as many households as CNN reached at the high
point of its coverage of the Clarence Thomas nomination to the
Supreme Court in 1991, though it does not approach the 6.6 million
figure it hit for the O.J. Simpson verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The network evening news broadcasts recorded about 15 percent
more viewing last week, with much of the increase going to NBC's
``Nightly News,'' which has regained supremacy among the three
network news programs over the past month.
</P>
<P>
   NBC was up 6 percent for the week, but the biggest reason was
not the impeachment story: It was the bombing of Iraq. On
Wednesday, the day the bombing was initiated, NBC's news had a 10.2
rating, far above the network's usual daily average, which is about
an 8. (Each rating point represents 994,000 homes.)
</P>
<P>
   Some CBS news staff members were stunned that the network cut
away not only for the football game itself but also for a pregame
show.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Student Journalists
</P>
<P>
   Those wondering what teen-agers think about the impeachment
debate might ordinarily rely on polls, surveys or the occasional
newspaper story. CNN, however, is letting some high school students
tell part of the story on national television this week, in an
unusual outgrowth of a program that it has designed with Turner
Learning to help young people learn to be television journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon's edition of CNN's ``Inside Politics'' is
scheduled to include a report produced, shot, written and edited by
students in the Maynard High School radio and television program,
in Maynard, Mass., one of 34 schools in a pilot program called CNN
Student Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   They will cover a forum being held Wednesday at Maynard High,
where Rep. Marty Meehan, a Democrat from that district, will answer
students' questions about the Clinton case and about why he favors
censure rather than impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., and students in Marietta, Ga.,
were to be part of the report, but the scheduling didn't work out.
``The idea came quite naturally since two of our very good pilot
schools are the ones in Massachusetts and in Marietta, and their
respective members of Congress were both on the House Judiciary
Committee, on opposite sides on this issue,'' said Alan Duke,
managing editor of the CNN Student Bureau, which started up in
September.
</P>
<P>
   From Atlanta, where Turner Learning is based, Duke assigns
stories, then edits and fact-checks the finished reports and helps
decide where they might appear _ on the Turner Learning Web site,
on CNN Newsroom (a daily newscast for in-classroom use), on cable
affiliates' local-access channels or, in rare cases, on regular
CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Maynard High School, supported by Cablevision of Massachusetts,
has had a radio and television curriculum for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an impressive program,'' said Duke, a 10-year veteran of
CNN, most recently its national news desk. ``These kids run the
cameras, the audio, everything. The reporter will write a script
and record it there, then I'll bring the tapes back to Atlanta for
editing _ just like we'd do if our Boston bureau was covering this
event.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hannon, CNN's political director, who oversees ``Inside
Politics,'' said he expected the report to run unless another major
news development pops up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It being Christmas Eve,'' he said, ``we anticipate the world
will be a little more tranquil than it has been in recent weeks.''
</P>

   An Alternative Special
</P>
<P>
   Are the children in the family tired of having the same old
Christmas ``classics'' forced on them this time of year? A little
bored with Rudolph, Frosty and the Grinch?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that is what inspired many public television stations to
schedule a weirdly wonderful alternative this year: Joseph Jacoby's
one-hour television film of ``Davy Jones' Locker,'' starring the
original Bil Baird Marionettes. (In New York, it's being shown by
WLIW on Channel 21 at noon on Christmas Day.)
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby began his career as a puppeteer, and worked for the late
Bil Baird, but went on to become a filmmaker. In 1993, he visited
Peter Baird, Bil's son, at his home. Baird took him to the
basement, where, Jacoby said, he found about 200 marionettes, ``all
these gems, sitting in old brown shoebox-style boxes that Bil had
made for them in the '50s, now coming apart at the seams and an
inch thick with dust.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby Entertainment bought them, and Jacoby set off on his
personal entrepreneurial quest to make quality videos for children
that are also entertaining. ``I'd been at Blockbuster, and there
was so little for children,'' he said. ``Mostly `Sesame Street'
retreads. I thought, I'll take my film knowledge, and go back to my
roots.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Davy Jones' Locker,'' made last year, he filmed the
marionettes as if they were actors. ``The camera can go behind,
around, even above the puppet, because you don't have to worry
about seeing the puppeteer underneath,'' he said. ``I told the
cameramen, `Think of these not as puppets but as people who happen
to have strings over their heads.'''
</P>
<P>
   But he still doesn't quite know why so many stations have seized
on his film as a holiday offering. Pirates, mermaids, buried
treasure?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very uplifting story,'' he said, groping for words,
``and it's a change of pace from the usual Rudolph? And it's a
musical.''

 &HT;    FIRM'S LEGAL 'ROCK STARS' KEY TO CENSURE DEAL?
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ From the flashing lights of the office Christmas
tree to the bright red braces holding up the tailored trousers of a
founding partner, seasonal good tidings fill the high-rent space at
Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand.
</P>
<P>
   After a year in which the law firm was generally acclaimed as
the most powerful and profitable influence broker in the nation's
capital, President Clinton has turned to two of the group's best
known members for advice in dealing with the Senate after his
impeachment by the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The worldwide publicity generated by such public service is one
of the reasons that Verner Liipfert recruited Republican Bob Dole
and Democrat George Mitchell _ the former Senate majority leaders
that Clinton has sought out to help in achieving a censure
resolution rather than a trial.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly four decades, ``we've been a good general service law
firm and pretty well connected in Washington life and politics and
legislation,'' partner Berl Bernhard said in an interview Tuesday.
``But we were kind of like a flower blooming in the desert. Unless
you were there and saw it, you never knew about it.''
</P>
<P>
   So Verner Liipfert set out ``to elevate our profile,'' Bernhard
explained.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, no other Washington law firm has made a harder
pitch to bring in nationally known former politicians. In addition
to Dole and Mitchell, the growing firm now includes former Texas
Gov. Ann Richards, a non-lawyer; Lloyd Bentsen, a former Democratic
senator from Texas and former Treasury Secretary; retiring Sen. Dan
Coats, R-Ind.; and former governors James Blanchard of Michigan and
John Waihee of Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Within Verner Liipfert, these high-profile members have been
dubbed the ``rock stars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Only in Washington could a group of people who look like a
reunion of Lawrence Welk's band be referred to as 'rock stars',''
Richards has joked.
</P>
<P>
   But the strategy seems to be paying off.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Fortune Magazine ranked Verner Liipfert at
the top of its list of ``Kings of K Street'' _ the lobbying firms
with the most power and access in the business. Many of these firms
are located near the intersection of K Street and Connecticut Ave,
not far from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Verner Liipfert has become a lobbying powerhouse, agrees Allan
Shuldiner, who studies the industry for the Center for Responsive
Politics, a non-partisan congressional watchdog group. Their income
from lobbying alone is impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1997, they ranked number one _ receiving the most income of
any lobbying firm, a little over $18 million,'' said Shuldiner.
``They have a lot of name politicians which increases their
visibility and appears to have increased their business. They were
the favorite of tobacco companies. Five major tobacco companies
paid them over $2 million apiece.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``federal affairs'' _ or lobbying _ branch only accounts for
15 to 18 percent of the firm's income, Bernhard pointed out. With
about 185 attorneys and consultants, the ``full service'' firm is
involved in practically all aspects of the law, he said. The
Washington-based firm has offices in Austin, Houston, Miami,
Honolulu, McLean, Va., and Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The clients include The Walt Disney Co., Brown &AMP; Williamson
Tobacco Corp., RJR Nabisco, Conrail, McDonnell Douglas Corp.,
Motorola, and Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to paying Dole a reported $600,000 a year and
Mitchell a reported $500,000 a year, the firm promised them the
freedom to continue to do public service projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, it's free advertising for the firm,'' said David
King, who teaches a course on lobbying at Harvard's Kennedy School
of Government. ``It's why they hire the big guns.''
</P>
<P>
   The publicity for the firm is priceless when a member like
Mitchell helps broker a peace deal in Northern Ireland or when Dole
bails out Newt Gingrich with a $300,000 loan to pay a congressional
fine _ or when they both advise the president on the censure
negotiations, the professor explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere down the pike we begin to get some financial reward
for their involvement,'' Bernhard conceded.
</P>
<P>
   Formed in 1960, the roots of Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard,
McPherson and Hand were planted in the Democratic administrations
of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Baines Johnson. Berl Bernhard worked
for both JFK and LBJ and later managed the presidential campaign of
Sen. Edmund Muskie, D-Me. Harry McPherson was LBJ's special counsel
from 1965 to 1969. Lloyd Hand was a staffer when Johnson was Senate
majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Dole and Coats were recruited to make the firm more bipartisan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed reach to all spectrums of political commitment,''
said Bernhard.
</P>
<P>
   However, the revolving-door perception of former lawmakers going
to Capitol Hill to persuade their former colleagues is not entirely
accurate. Dole has made it plain, for instance, that he considered
such ``hat in hand'' lobbying as ``demeaning.''
</P>
<P>
   For former majority leaders like Dole and Mitchell, ``it would
be unseemly to go to Capitol Hill,'' agreed King. But their advice
is valuable because they know the personalities of the key players
and the ways and means of getting things done in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   So Dole and Mitchell sit in when other Verner Liipfert attorneys
present their plans to help clients with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of times, George will say something like 'I think
that's a smart thing, but you might want to think about doing it in
a different way, a little more practical.' And Dole , in his unique
way, will say 'That's not going to work'.'' explained Bernhard.
``It's very helpful. They've been there. ... That's a unique
talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor King said the ``great strength'' of Verner Liipfert is
not its rainmakers like Dole, Mitchell and Richards but rather its
associates in their mid-20s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The firm's genius is that they've gone to the nation's top law
schools and recruited the best graduates ... and convinced them
that politics is a noble profession,'' he said. As lobbyists,
``they speak the same language'' as the young congressional
staffers who actually compose the legislation on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It runs together,'' said Bernhard. Bringing in the
high-profile former politicians has helped in recruiting better law
school graduates.
</P>
<P>
   In deciding to add the so-called senior statesmen to the firm,
Bernhard said, ``My biggest concern was 'Is this going to be like a
retirement home?' It's been the opposite. ``
</P>
<P>
   The firms aging ``rock stars'' have ``incredible energy'' and
have proven to be ``working people rather than kind of monuments
from the past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in welcoming Dole to the firm in 1997, Richards jokingly
warned him about the workload.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably fed you some line about how your name alone
would do wonders for the firm ...,'' she said. ``Reality is, they
work us like dogs. 'Show me the billable hours. Show me the
billable hours'.''

SPAGHETTI-XMAS-FOOD (Phoenix) - This just in, from the Tidings of
Great Joy division: You can eat whatever you want for Christmas
dinner. There is no umbilical link between a kitchen in chaos and
the first Noel.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And you do not have to lose your minds like my family did just
to discover this. By DIANE PORTER. Story moved in the ``D''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
ETHNIC-XMAS-FOOD (Phoenix) - We knew we'd hear some great stories
when we asked readers to share their non-traditional Christmas
meals. And, we learned, it all boils down to one thing: ``It's far
more than food,'' Terri Harrington said. ``It's something you bring
to your table and with it go a thousand and one memories.'' By JUDY
WALKER. Story moved in the ``D'' category. &QL; 
 &QL;

worldwide. Now, ``The Good Man of Nanking: The Diaries of John
Rabe'' introduces another Nazi businessman who was imbued with
decency and courage. By JON KAMMAN. Story moved in the ``E''

EDIT-CLINTON-IRAQ (Phoenix) - This past weekend, two embattled
presidents stood on opposite sides of the world, each proclaiming
victory. As the dust cleared and people began sorting through the
rubble in Washington, D.C., and Baghdad, it was Saddam Hussein, not
Bill Clinton, who could stake the better claim to victory. Story
moved in the ``K'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NOTARO-COLUMN (Phoenix) - I understand that the holidays sometimes
bring out the worst in people. But I've grown to enjoy our family
holidays and even look forward to them, despite the fact that they
now include medical procedures, as was demonstrated at Thanksgiving
when my mother hauled a high-blood-pressure machine to the dining
room table and made all of us roll up our sleeves. By LAURI NOTARO.
Story will move in the ``L'' category. &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since early November, the vast majority of
the nation will be unseasonably cold. Only southern Florida will
average above normal temperatures. The core of the frigid air will
be over the northern Plains with another mound of gelid air trapped
in the valleys of the central Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure stretching from the Northeast coast to the
interior Northwest will sponsor dry weather for most sections.
Winds will be much gentler in New England. A push of fresh polar
air across the Great Lakes will trigger more snow squalls on
eastern shores of Lakes Michigan, Erie and Ontario. The heaviest
snow should fall on the Tug Hill plateau of central New York.
Flurries will continue in the mountains of New England.
</P>
<P>
   Jet stream winds from the Southwest will direct a disturbance
from the western Gulf States toward the Middle Atlantic region. A
veil of clouds will stream northeast into the Ohio Valley and
across the central Appalachians. Patches of light snow will develop
from the northern Ozarks to central West Virginia. Accumulations
should be less than two inches. A swath of icy rain will lead to
hazardous travel from northeast Texas across the Tennessee Valley
and into central Virginia and North Carolina. A chill rain will
dampen parts of the Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Winds ascending the southern Rockies will produce light snow in
the Four Corners region, otherwise the West will be bright and very
cold. Clouds will arrive in the Northwest as a warm front
approaches from the North Pacific. Showers will develop along the
coast later on.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Clockwork
</P>
<P>
   Within the first two hours of astronomical winter, two records
were established in the middle of the nation. At Indianapolis, snow
began falling at 9:44 p.m. on Monday evening, marking the first and
latest occurrence of snowflakes in that city. In fact, the previous
latest date was December 7, 1994. An hour later in Little Rock,
Ark., the mercury fell to freezing for the first time since March
13, ending the longest growing season in that area at 283 days.
Both events just happened to coincide with the traditional
beginning of the new season and both cities will remain locked in
wintry chill Wednesday with well below seasonal readings.

FEDS AWARD WEAPONS PROJECTS TO TENNESSEE, SOUTH CAROLINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Energy Department announced Tuesday it would
produce tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen that boosts the
destructive power of nuclear warheads, at civilian nuclear power
plants in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson also announced that the
department awarded another defense-related nuclear project to a
plant in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson told a news conference that the department would
produce tritium at the Tennessee Valley Authority's Watts Bar
nuclear plant southwest of Knoxville, while TVA's Sequoyah plant
outside Chattanooga would serve as a back-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watts Bar-Sequoyah is our best option for our national
security. It is a proven technology. It's the best deal by far for
the taxpayer,'' he said. ``It has the flexibility to meet our
present and future tritium needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Richardson declined to give details about the cost, he
said the department's choice was ``by far, the least expensive
option.'' He said that the project's estimated cost would be
released in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A Congressional Budget Office report released in August found
that using existing nuclear reactors such as Watts Bar and Sequoyah
would cost approximately $1.1 billion over 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   The two plants are part of TVA's network of nuclear plants, dams
and other facilities that produce electricity for commercial and
home use. The nuclear plants are expected to continue producing
electricity while they make tritium.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the House approved legislation that would
have prohibited the use of a commercial nuclear reactor to product
tritium, but the measure failed in the Senate. Supporters of the
House-passed measure argued that using a commercial reactor would
breach the long-standing separation of commercial and defense uses
of nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson also announced that the federal government's Savannah
River Site in Aiken, S.C., which last produced tritium in 1988,
will be the site of a plant crucial to the disposal of the nation's
dangerous stockpile of plutonium, a key ingredient in nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   At the Aiken plant, workers would take apart the radioactive
cores of nuclear weapons and convert the pure plutonium metal
inside into a powered oxide.
</P>
<P>
   The new output of tritium will allow the Defense Department to
update and maintain the nation's nuclear arsenal, even as the
pit-conversion plant works to dismantle older nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's decisions ended months of lobbying by politicians
from several states intent on recovering thousands of jobs lost in
post-Cold War cutbacks in the defense industry.
</P>
<P>
   On a tour of prospective sites in August, Richardson was met by
governors, members of Congress and state officials to discuss his
pending decisions.
</P>
<P>
   During a trip to Texas, state officials pushed Richardson to
locate the plutonium processing plant at the Pantex site near
Amarillo. Texas Sens. Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, both
Republicans, also lobbied for the Pantex site.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Senators Gramm and Hutchison, I'm sorry I couldn't
accommodate,'' Richardson said during his Tuesday news conference,
adding that ``Pantex will have a future at energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington state pushed to place the tritium plant at the Fast
Flux Test Facility, a reactor in the Hanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``A decision like this required difficult choices, and I
understand that the decisions are especially difficult for the
communities not chosen,'' Richardson said.

 &HT;    Politicians missing Christian spirit of Christmas
 &HT;    By Ana Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week, most of the people who live in the United States will
celebrate
</P>
<P>
   Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   The day marks the birth in humble circumstances of the man
Christians
</P>
<P>
   believe to be the son of God, a man who changed the world. For
the past four weeks, many of those same Christians have marked the
season of Advent, a time of preparing to celebrate the birth of
Jesus through prayer, meditation, family activities and religious
services.
</P>
<P>
   Many have not.
</P>
<P>
   Most people prepare by spending money.
</P>
<P>
   Our president has been trying to save himself from being removed
from office for having had an affair with an intern, for lying and
for trying to get others to lie.
</P>
<P>
   He also has dispatched bombers to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Our Congress has been practicing vengeance, trying to disguise
it as justice.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Livingston, in line to become Speaker of the House, received
a standing ovation from his colleagues after acknowledging he was
unfaithful to his
</P>
<P>
   wife several times. (He said Saturday he will not serve as
Speaker and plans to resign from Congress.)
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances surrounding these activities in our government
have been and will continue to be explained and re-explained,
touched up and re-delivered, but no matter what spin they are
given, the picture that results is ugly.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been looking a lot like Christmas in these United
States, this country which bills itself as a Christian nation
claiming, ``in God we trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you think we missed the message that was delivered some 2,000
years ago?
</P>
<P>
   Or will it all be OK on Friday when we wish each other peace on
earth?

`THE THEORY OF FLIGHT': MEETING MR. RIGHT BEFORE THE REAPER 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes are at the end of the review.) 
(rl) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Her head twisted painfully to one side, her dark brown eyes
casting defiant sidelong glances at the world, and speaking in
dragged-out syllables delivered in semi-intelligible moans and
groans, Helena Bonham Carter gives what may be the stunt
performance of the year as Jane, a feisty young woman dying of Lou
Gehrig's disease in ``The Theory of Flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane, who wears her hair in a just-hatched-baby-bird look nested
beneath a baseball cap, dresses like a race-car driver (in a jacket
printed with the words ``Lucky Strike'') and navigates aggressively
in a motorized wheelchair. When too exhausted to speak, she resorts
to a voice machine that translates her typed messages into
electronic speech. Both her spoken and typed communications abound
in profanities. For Jane has a proudly dirty mind. Much of her
spare time is consumed watching videos of hard-core pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Sad to say, but Jane is the only person resembling a full-scale
character in the film, which might be described as a
disease-of-the-week movie with comic and mythic pretensions.
Directed by Paul Greengrass from a screenplay by Richard Hawkins,
``Theory of Flight'' imagines itself an inspirational romantic
comedy, a sort of elevated late-90s variation of ``David and Lisa''
tricked out with antic humor. But because Richard (Kenneth
Branagh), Jane's partner in mutual salvation, is such a hollow
contrivance and Branagh's performance too bland to arouse any
feeling, the movie seems hopelessly lopsided and empty.
</P>
<P>
   Richard is really more an allegorical construction than a human
being. A failed painter who builds primitive flying machines, he is
an overgrown adolescent dreamer who may be more than a touch
cracked in the head. Richard gets in trouble with the law after he
attempts to lift off from the spire of a London office building
wearing a pair of wings and lands on a rescue squad's giant
cushion. For the expense and trouble of saving his life, he is
sentenced to do social-service work. His first assignment is to be
the companion of Jane, whose bad temper has driven away every other
caretaker hired so far.
</P>
<P>
   After some initial skirmishes, Jane takes a liking to Richard.
And it isn't long before she pops the big question: will he help
her lose her virginity before she dies? She doesn't expect him to
be the lover, she adds hastily. In fact, she would prefer someone
more like Richard Gere in ``American Gigolo.'' Goaded by Jane,
Richard reluctantly undertakes the search for Jane's erotic
deliverance, starting with employment agencies, moving to a topless
club whose patrons are disabled, and finally settling on a suave
professional escort he and Jane spot squiring around older women at
a fancy hotel. To subsidize Jane's pricey journey into ecstasy,
however, Richard decides he must rob a bank.
</P>
<P>
   While the search for a sexual partner is going on, Richard, who
has moved to a shack in the countryside, is putting together his
latest aeronautical contraption, a crude biplane that represents a
last-ditch attempt to fly. For a man obsessed with invention, he
exhibits an extraordinary lack of enthusiasm. Playing down any
eccentric traits, Branagh ambles through his role with a suave
detachment that suggests Michael Caine on Valium.
</P>
<P>
   The novelty of hearing Ms. Bonham Carter spew four-letter words
fades quickly. So does the sight of Branagh elaborately rehearsing
how to rob a bank. This versatile actor has many strengths, but as
his wooden turn in ``Celebrity'' has already demonstrated, comedy
isn't one of them.

TALLAS TELLS IT TO THE COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Rob Tallas hadn't played since Nov. 24 _ the longest
stretch he had ever sat on the bench. So on Sunday the Bruins
goalie paid a visit to coach Pat Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Tallas was in the net the next night, and he chalked up a 3-2
victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning.
</P>
<P>
   Part of his inactivity had to do with how well starter Byron
Dafoe was playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did have a lot of time off and not a lot of games,'' Tallas
said. ``It was hard to look at what game I was going to get in. But
the Tampa Bay game was a challenge, both physically and mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   Tallas has played well against the Lightning, as he raised his
record against Tampa Bay to 5-0 with his 24-save performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those teams you have a lot of luck (against), and
you have the bounces that go your way,'' said Tallas, who has a 4-2
record and a 1.88 goals against average (.926 save percentage).
</P>
<P>
   ``You just build up your emotions and you always play well
against a certain team a certain way,'' said Tallas. ``The team
plays well against them. It's not just me. Our defense was good. We
take control of teams that are below us. It's nice to have a team
that you're 5-0 against. You like to play against certain teams.''
</P>
<P>
   In his meeting with Burns, Tallas learned he was getting the
start and guaranteed the coach a win. ``He wanted to make it clear
to me and let me know the importance of the game, that's why he let
me know rather than telling me later on the ice,'' Tallas said.
``We were speaking on the same level, and I knew the importance of
the challenge that I faced.''
</P>
<P>
   Tallas had stated how much he wanted to get in the lineup again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guaranteed a game last year, too,'' the netminder said.
``Coach had to make a decision. Byron has been playing so well and
we had a couple of days off. The coach knew it would be a tough
game. The guarantee was more of a promise of how I would go out and
get the win, to just have him give me a chance. I didn't want to
sit any longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was a tough decision, the way Byron's been playing.
He wanted to keep the ball rolling before the Christmas break. It's
something I had to say to him, that I still have the confidence in
myself. It certainly wasn't an easy game, they have a better lineup
and plus there was the emotional level.''
</P>
<P>
   Tallas' biggest concern was that he might be a little tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the period (the Bruins trailed, 1-0), I tried to settle
down a little and control my rebounds,'' he said. ``There were
extra shots that could have really cost us and it would have been
my fault. Fortunately, I came up with some saves. (The Lightning)
were a hungry team that first period, playing with a lot of
emotion, throwing the puck at the net and looking for the
rebounds.''
</P>
<P>
   And Tallas was there at the end, including when Tampa Bay pulled
its goaltender and he blocked two tough shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing was as the game went on I felt
stronger and I was happy it wasn't a blowout,'' he said. ``I felt
better as the game went on. I rose to the challenge. It was the
type game I wanted to be in. It was physicially challenging.''
</P>
<P>
   Tallas isn't sure when he'll get his next start, but he will
stay ready, waiting for the word from Burns.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's strictly up to the coach,'' said Tallas, who woke up
with some back soreness. ``The way Byron is playing, I don't want
to take anything away from him or anything away from me. We're
happy to see each other succeed.''

DESPITE CEASE-FIRE, ANGOLA'S LONG DORMANT WAR REAWAKENS
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By SUZANNE DALEY  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUENA, Angola _ In this small town in eastern Angola, there is
little doubt that a war that was dormant for nearly four years has
begun again.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees from the countryside have been streaming in for
months now, huddling around their smoky coal stoves in the
crumbling, leaky sports stadium, in a former school building, in
the abandoned railway station.
</P>
<P>
   They are by the river, too, where thousands including Lino
Paulino have managed to build small grass huts to crawl into during
this rainy season. Paulino, 67, said he came here after rebels of
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola invaded his
village six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was the village leader, he said, the rebels stripped
him and tied him to a tree. Then, he said, they forced his wives to
strip and paraded them before their neighbors, saying these were
women ``who had given birth to government supporters.'' In a few
terrifying hours they beat others who resisted their will, took the
food and supplies they wanted and kidnapped 15 youngsters to turn
them into soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The peace treaty that gave Angola, a country rich in diamond and
oil deposits, its longest cease-fire in 30 years is in shambles.
Since June the Unita rebel forces have retaken more than half the
countryside, engaging the Angolan Army in hundreds of places and
flushing more than 200,000 Angolans from their villages.
</P>
<P>
   The fiercest fighting came this month, when the government
decided to attack two rebel strongholds, bombing the central towns
of Andulo and Bailundo for three days.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks, however, underestimated Unita's strength and the
army was pushed back, United Nations officials say. They added that
Unita then laid siege to two much larger government-controlled
cities in the central highlands, Huambo and Kuito. It downed a
government transport plane and shelled Kuito by night and attacked
the town of Malanje to the north.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent peace effort in Angola, the second attempt this
decade to bring an end to a long and bloody war, has already cost
the United Nations more than $1 billion. Earlier this year many
thought it was almost complete and the United Nations was scaling
down its presence here.
</P>
<P>
   Despite frequent delays, most of the requirements of the 1994
agreement, known as the Lusaka Protocol, had been achieved, at
least on paper. But analysts now say that key provisions of the
pact, including the disbanding of Unita troops, never really
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 71,000 Unita soldiers who reported to demobilization
camps, about half simply left a few months later. Of those who
remained, many were too old or too young to have ever been
guerrillas and were clearly sent just to collect the tools, food
and cash that demobilized soldiers were entitled to.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, few weapons were collected. Though the accord said
all demobilized soldiers were supposed to turn in a working weapon,
more than half brought nothing and others brought only broken
weapons. Few large weapons and no telecommunications equipment were
ever seen. But the United Nations and the three countries
shepherding the process _ the United States, Russia and Portugal,
the former colonial power _ turned a blind eye.
</P>
<P>
   Peace began breaking down when the government started taking
over the administration of former Unita areas, installing local
governments and police officers, many of whom began a campaign
against Unita supporters, arresting, beating and sometimes killing
them. Unita began retaliating and hostilities grew. One factor that
no doubt contributed to the decline of the peace effort was the
death of its overseer, the U.N. special envoy Alioune Blondin Beye,
who was killed in a plane crash in June. It took months to replace
him.
</P>
<P>
   Also complicating matters has been instability nearby. Angola
sent troops to intervene in civil wars in Congo Republic and Congo,
the former Zaire. Some analysts say that gave the government
delusions of grandeur and diverted its attention from its own
problems. Diplomats in Angola and military analysts in South Africa
say that the government has brought thousands of troops home in the
last few weeks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Luena, once a major agricultural center but now a collection
of bullet-pocked houses and overgrown weeds, the fear is palpable.
Every time a plane lands on the potholed runway, dozens of
residents gather with their luggage hoping to bribe their way out
of town when the plane takes off again.
</P>
<P>
   A recent effort to distribute food to the refugees was a tense
affair. Fights broke out constantly as mothers squabbled over whose
turn it was and the amounts being handed out. Police officers
flailed with sticks and waved machine guns to drive them back.
</P>
<P>
   Most were afraid that the town would be invaded soon and that
aid workers would be evacuated. Dozens of children hovered,
clutching tin cans, looking for chances to race in and steal
handfuls of salt or grain. When a bit of corn spilled on the grass,
they fell to the ground scrambling for every kernel until the
police whipped them. One boy, perhaps 7 years old, who managed to
steal a cup full of grain was shot at by three officers, but
escaped across a field.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are worried that this is it _ they won't get more,''
Maria Flynn of the World Food Program said. ``That's why it is so
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   At night, gunshots ring out all over the town. Last week
government soldiers drove through the streets in trucks rounding up
young men of fighting age and taking them to the airport. Witnesses
said that sobbing, screaming mothers and wives followed behind,
begging for information about where their men were going.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the countryside see Angola's capital, Luanda, as a
haven. In the last week more than 1,200 families arrived at the
airport from Kuito alone. Aid workers said that among the refugees
were 60 unaccompanied children, some as young as 4, with no
relatives in Luanda. Their parents had decided that they had a
better chance to survive alone in the capital than in Kuito. For
the time being, they are in orphanages.
</P>
<P>
   But fear runs high in Luanda, too. The government has also been
rounding up young men in the miles of slums that surround this
decrepit city, where electricity and water are erratic and police
officers known as ninjas patrol in groups of a dozen packed into
the back of small pick-up trucks, their machine guns at the ready.
Travel agencies are flooded with families trying to get their
children, particularly army-age boys, out of the country. Most pay
bribes of more than $300, a fortune to many Angolan, for exit
visas.
</P>
<P>
   Information about the fighting is sketchy. Military hospitals
are off-limits and the government shuts down the airports whenever
it lands its planes. It has also been running a propaganda
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have lashed out at the United Nations,
accusing it of failing to disarm Unita. It excuses its recent
military setbacks by saying that Unita has sophisticated weaponry.
It also accuses Unita of restarting the war, saying it wanted a
showy victory in time for anniversary celebrations of Unita's
founding on Dec. 25.
</P>
<P>
   But U.N. officials say the government began the latest wave of
fighting. Political analysts say Angola's president, Jose Eduardo
dos Santos, is having difficulties with his own party and wanted to
capture Andulo and Bailundo in time to impress the yearly party
congress convening Dec. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Dos Santos has been facing criticism because after nearly four
years of relative peace, and despite huge oil revenues, his
government has accomplished very little. Squalid hospitals run
short of drugs, schools do not function and prisoners die of
starvation in jails.
</P>
<P>
   Angola gained its independence from Portugal in 1975 after 14
years of fighting. No sooner had the Portuguese left than a civil
war began, fueled by the Cold War. On one side was dos Santos'
party, the Marxist Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola,
backed by the Russians and the Cubans. On the other was Unita,
headed by Jonas Savimbi, part anti-Communist, part personality
cult, supported by the United States and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 a peace treaty was brokered and elections held. However,
when Savimbi lost, he quickly went back to war. On the verge of
defeat, he agreed to a new peace treaty in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United Nations has a new representative in place,
Issa Diallo, it is unclear whether the peace effort can be put back
together again. In September the government cut off all
negotiations with Savimbi, and it has refused to let Diallo meet
with him. Diallo says there is hope because neither side has
completely rejected the Lusaka Protocol. But others say talks have
all but collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is very little going on,'' said one diplomat
close to the negotiations. ``The question is whether we can get it
going again. But right now there is very little talking going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say that the only real incentive to peace is the
understanding by both sides that neither can annihilate the other.
Unita's guerrillas can take ground, but cannot hold it. The
government forces are said to be underpaid, undertrained and far
from enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   Among the refugees in Luena it is hard to find anyone who
understands what the war is about or cares who wins, as long as it
stops. ``I cannot explain it,'' said Rita Anita, 26, who was
dressed in rags and nursing a rash on her face. ``The war was going
on when I was born.''

`THE SWINDLE': IN CHABROL'S 50TH FEATURE, WHAT ARE HIS SCAM ARTISTS
DOING?
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(fb) 
 By JANET MASLIN  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Claude Chabrol devotes his 50th feature, ``The Swindle,'' to the
suave trickery that has been so alluring throughout his long
career. It centers upon the wily teamwork of Isabelle Huppert and
Michel Serrault, who play veteran con artists with a most cryptic
connection.
</P>
<P>
   During the course of the story, questions arise about whether
these longtime partners in crime are trying to hoodwink each other,
but the story's duplicitousness reaches further than that. While
the principals play their tricks, Chabrol (who weaves in allusions
to some of his earlier work here) keeps busy fooling you.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Huppert plays Betty, the kind of femme fatale whose long red
talons can be found pouring a dose of sleeping potion into the
drink of an unsuspecting lawn mower salesman she has picked up in a
hotel. Betty excels at parts of this job like calling herself the
director of an insurance company or sitting seductively in a black
slip waiting for the man to pass out so Serrault's character can go
through his wallet. And her partner brings just as much zest to
such larcenous situations.
</P>
<P>
   Chabrol wrote the film with precisely these two actors in mind
and told Serrault (making his 127th film appearance) to think ``he
enjoys himself'' while playing the role. As to who Serrault's
character actually is, that is more of a mystery. He favors
pseudonyms like ``Col. Emmanuel Victor'' and plays an officer and a
gentleman with panache. But what exactly does he have to do with
Betty? One of the film's most interesting gambits is to keep the
essence of their connection out of reach. The two stars play their
roles with such coy agility that they can seem to be lovers or
father and daughter or merely longtime colleagues, all at the same
moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Swindle'' entertainingly observes the two in action for a
while, until they embark on a scam that proves bigger than both of
them. Betty changes names and wigs and heads for the Swiss resort
Sils Maria, near St. Moritz, to wreak havoc on a dentists'
convention. But when he arrives a bit later, the so-called colonel
finds something amiss. Betty, now impersonating a Russian blonde
named Sissi, has latched onto a handsome businessman (Francois
Cluzet) who is either a perfect target or an uninvited third
partner in crime.
</P>
<P>
   All it takes is a briefcase full of money, which the businessman
is scheduled to bring to Guadeloupe, to bring treachery into this
menage. Exactly how and why it happens, with Serrault registering
comic chagrin and Ms. Huppert relishing each chance to confound
him, is at the heart of this film's considerable charm.
</P>
<P>
   Even when it threatens to sink into the familiar mechanics of a
double-dealing heist story, Chabrol keeps curiosity piqued, the
actors delightful and the outcome in sufficient question. The
performances are so winkingly adroit that ``The Swindle'' becomes
as much a character study as a caper story. Thanks to the sleek,
psychologically astute direction that has been Chabrol's hallmark,
it glides gracefully as both.

HAND IT TO HILLARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Time magazine made a mistake in passing over First
Lady Hillary Clinton for its annual ``Man of the Year'' cover in
favor of her faithless husband and his scary, self-righteous
persecutor, Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The two men are pitiful examples of officials in a democracy
granted high public trust abusing their legal and political power.
Hillary Clinton, by contrast, has displayed incredible strength of
character by carrying on all year under enormous stress with
dignity, common sense and purpose.
</P>
<P>
   She too has power, all the more significant for being unusual in
an undefined female role that has traditionally been subordinate
and silenced. But she has used it wisely and carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Time insists that its criteria for the honor is merely to
recognize the individual or individuals who have most affected the
news and our lives during the year, not to glorify presumed
greatness or goodness. The magazine has indeed picked some
certifiable louses, including Adolf Hitler in 1928 and Josef Stalin
in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine also picked House Speaker Newt Gingrich in 1995
even though Gingrich had already become a liability for his party,
increasingly unpopular for his extreme views and laboring under an
ethics cloud for using tax-exempt money for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   So singling out a couple of bozos is not meant to send any
particular message except that they have destroyed each other's
reputations, shredded respect for the presidency and the law and
dominated the media, for better or worse. What impact their titanic
struggle is supposed to have on our own lives is murky, aside from
turning our stomachs and making sex into a national guffaw.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton's impact, however, is easier to quantify. She
has revolutionized the nation's concept of how a president's wife
should behave. Barbara Bush is the last first lady who will get
away with squandering her years in the White House posing as a
simple housewife who refuses to get directly involved in public
issues.
</P>
<P>
   By becoming a political combatant, Mrs. Clinton has become
almost as controversial as her husband. This, of course, has the
perverse effect of making her more newsworthy then her
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   She was blamed for the defeat of the administration's first big
legislative effort, reform of the health care system. She was a
prime target of Independent Counsel Starr, who probed her legal
practice in Arkansas, sent her close associate Webster Hubbell to
jail and hauled her before a grand jury for hours of humiliating
questioning.
</P>
<P>
   She was even criticized recently by the Wall Street Journal for
appearing on the cover of Vogue in a sedate velvet gown looking
entirely too glamorous for the paper's taste. Incredibly, the
Journal's crabby, 19th century editorial found it incongruous that
a woman the newspaper finds as sneaky as her husband could also
look serenely at home in elegant clothes. Apparently sackcloth and
ashes would be the preferred garb.
</P>
<P>
   But Hillary Clinton is demonstrating that a woman can remain
very much a woman while being as tough-minded as a man and maybe
more so. No female wimp she. This is an important message for
American women, who are still importuned by right-wing purists to
stay at home and defer to male superiority in the marketplace of
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   She is a popular symbol among women and a major reason that the
president retains high job-approval ratings among them despite his
miserable affair with a White House intern. If she can stand by
him, no matter how complicated their relationship, so can they.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning nonstop across the country, she was also a prime
force in turning around what had seemed like a certain Democratic
disaster in the November elections. She raised gobs of money,
energized the troops and delivered an upbeat message that worked.
The president himself could not campaign without generating
additional news stories about his legal problems.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other single person, she was responsible for the
surprisingly successful Democratic surge at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   And more than any other single person, Hillary Clinton, in her
public conduct during this trying period, has set the standard by
which the president will ultimately be judged by most voters.
According to insiders, she has in turn been stunned, angry,
disappointed, stoic and chilly.
</P>
<P>
   She has not tried to pretend that she can ignore what he did,
any more than the country can. But in recent days, as House
impeachment loomed, she carefully indicated that she still believes
in his presidency and supports it, as the polls indicate most
voters do. She returned to the hand-holding and the glowing words
about his leadership that had vanished, and she lobbied for him
with House Democrats before the impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows whether she is following the instincts of the country
to rally behind him or the country is following her. But certainly
they are in synch, moving in tandem. It has not always been true,
but she has the pulse of the nation now.
</P>
<P>
   The president and Starr have guaranteed that in the future
neither will play a larger role on the national stage than they did
when they began their mad grapple of mutual destruction. Hillary
Clinton alone has a bright, unlimited future. Time may yet have to
name her ``Man of the Year'' one day.

COOLING THE PASSIONS IN THE BAVARIAN ALPS 
(FOR RELEASE SUN., DEC. 27) 
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 - 2TAKES(1,135) - NYT By ROGER COHEN  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service 
  With its gabled homes and its gracious setting beside a river,
the town of Oberammergau in the foothills of the Bavarian Alps
gives an initial impression of idyllic simplicity. A place to walk,
ski, breathe and dine on local game and fish. But in Oberammergau,
history, fantasy and religious fervor intertwine to complicate
prettiness with myth.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The town is home to the Passion Play, performed almost every 10
years since 1634. At that time, much of Europe had done a fair job
of wiping itself out in wars between Catholics and Protestants, and
plague accompanied the devastation. To ward off the advancing
disease, villagers in Oberammergau prayed; when their prayers were
answered and their town largely spared, they were true to a vow
that every 10 years they would retell the story of the death and
resurrection of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   A simple enough saga, on the face of it: suffering vanquished by
the force of faith. But the Passion Play has become a focus of
other tales in which Hitler, feminist battles, accusations of
anti-Semitism and intense theological debate have all played a
part. A lot, one might think, for a town of just 5,000 souls to
digest. But, Oberammergau and its Passion Play have thrived.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that a vast Passionspielhaus (Passion Play Theater) is
now covered in scaffolding as it undergoes an $8 million
renovation. The work _ including the installation of under-floor
heating and 4,700 wider seats (necessary, says Harald Rettelbach, a
spokesman, to accommodate ``ample American girths'') _ is designed
to offer comfort to the half-million spectators expected in the
year 2000 to watch the 40th staging of the play.
</P>
<P>
   The first of 100 scheduled performances, on May 22, 2000, is
still 17 months away, and the cast _ drawn from the townspeople and
picked at a meeting of the town council _ not yet chosen. But
Oberammergau is already full of a excitement at the approach of the
millennial play and offers, in the quiet before the crowds come, an
unusual combination of tranquil charm and passionate debate.
</P>
<P>
   The charm is easy to find. Stroll past stores filled with an
astonishing variety of woodcarvings; visit houses adorned with the
elaborate trompe l'oeil paintings of Franz Seraph Zwinck and his
18th-century school; see the later images of Hansel and Gretel that
decorate the orphanage; cross-country ski along the banks of the
River Ammer and range as far as the Linderhof Castle of King Ludwig
II with its lavish expressions of the Bavarian monarch's fantasies;
return to steaming bowls of potato soup served in cozy inns.
</P>
<P>
   The walks are unspoiled. One of them takes you down the valley
to the small town of Ettal, whose Benedictine monastery, built in
the 18th century by Joseph Schmutzer, boasts an imposing
white-and-ocher courtyard and a rococo church that is a riot of
gilt and pinkish marble.
</P>
<P>
   The parish church in Oberammergau, also built by Schmutzer, is
similarly ornate, offset only by a Gothic cross. It is at the foot
of this crucifix that the villagers are said to have made the vow
in 1633 that led to the Passion Play.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the play's the thing. What distinguishes
Oberammergau is the way a day of hearty relaxation inevitably
collides, at some point, with the passions and controversies of the
town's most renowned attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the middle-aged woman running the bookstore is quite
likely to be a former Virgin Mary with strong views on the place of
tradition; the lady at the crafts shop a campaigner for women's
rights in the production; the man downing beer in the tavern an
erstwhile Pontius Pilate grappling with adaptations of the text
designed to insure that offensive stereotypes are removed.
</P>
<P>
   All of these people have their opinions and one result is that
discussions here tend to eschew real-estate, politics, sports or
the best trekking trails in favor of questions such as the meaning
of the sacrifice of Jesus for humanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that Jesus died for us is a very exacting one,'' said
Otto Huber, a schoolteacher, as he sipped a riesling in his
book-lined home. ``Life from death _ a vast subject. You know, my
father was a Nazi, nothing important, he was just an ordinary party
member, like so many Germans. I was born in 1947, and I remember
him, when I was 15, telling me how important it was to respect the
Jews. He was a Nazi and he was also, I have to say, a good father
to me. Life is full of mysteries.''
</P>
<P>
   Huber and the play's young director, Christian Stueckl, have
been working for several years to modernize costumes and a
19th-century script that have long provoked charges of
anti-Semitism. The process began before the 1990 play but it has
now been taken further.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation of Jews as traitors interested only in money
and often wearing hats in the form of devil's horns _ a mise en
scene that delighted Hitler when he visited Oberammergau for a
special 300th-anniversary performance in 1934 _ has been
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   A scene where a crowd of Jews would come forward and taunt Jesus
on the cross, asking why he did not descend if he was indeed the
son of God, has been refashioned to include Roman soldiers in the
mob. Modern direction, with a sharper focus, is now intended to
give the play its impetus.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the story of Jesus, you can look at the love or you can
dwell on the violence,'' Huber said. ``I think we should now look
more at the love.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, a delegation from the American Jewish Committee and
the Anti-Defamation League held three days of talks with town
officials, including the mayor, Klement Fend. The discussions
appear to have been fruitful.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi A. James Rudin, the interreligious affairs director of the
American Jewish Committee, said it was clear that the ``reform
movement'' in the town now had the upper hand, adding that
``enormous progress has been made in putting an end to anti-Jewish
stereotypes.''
</P>
<P>
   While Rabbi Rudin said that a final judgment would have to await
the play itself in 2000, he expressed the hope that ``the
grandparent of many other passion plays, particularly in the United
States, will now set an appropriate example.''
</P>
<P>
   Fend, the Mayor, said: ``When I look back at German deeds this
century, I am very ashamed. If we can do anything to promote
understanding, that is our job.'' Such statements are quite new in
Oberammergau, long a deeply conservative town.
</P>
<P>
   Talks about the play's content have been held between senior
Catholic and Protestant churchmen. Although the play began in a
village that was then completely Catholic, like much of southern
Germany, it has come to be celebrated as much or more by
Protestants, who visit Oberammergau in large numbers from the
United States and Britain.

 UNDATED: and Britain.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the keenest admirers of the play was King Ludwig II, who
ascended the Bavarian throne in 1864 and later had a crucifix
erected on a hill above Oberammergau to show his admiration for the
town. Ludwig was an eccentric, solitary dreamer who never married,
devoted much of his energy to building fairy-tale palaces and
drowned in still-mysterious circumstances at age 41.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most outlandish of his castles is at Neuschwanstein,
about a 45-minute drive from Oberammergau. But closer at hand, is
his Schloss Linderhof, a retreat inspired by the Petit Trianon at
Versailles. The King liked to ride there in a golden rococo sleigh.
</P>
<P>
   Linderhof stands in the midst of the Graswang Valley on
sprawling grounds. Objects of beauty abound _ fireplaces of lapis
lazuli, a hand-carved ivory chandelier, delicate Meissen and Sevres
porcelain, malachite tables presented by the Russian czar _ but it
is the strange unity of a singular man's fantasy, rather than
individual pieces, that is most compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the King in the Room of Mirrors, alone by candlelight,
watching his reflection receding endlessly. Or sitting down to a
solitary meal in the crimson dining room awaiting a dinner served
on a table raised and lowered by a dumbwaiter system so that he was
never seen as he ate. Or alone in his vast bedroom gazing at a
ceiling fresco of a king in a chariot being swept through the sky
by angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ludwig was an eccentric,'' said Hubert Bansch, one of the
dedicated castle staff. ``But there is absolutely no proof that he
was actually mad. Where, after all, does eccentricity end and
madness begin?''
</P>
<P>
   Food in town is not elaborate, but portions are huge and service
friendly. Perhaps the best restaurant is the Boeld, which has a
fine variety of game, including venison, pheasant, wild boar and
wild duck, in season. Try them with spaetzle, Bavarian homemade
pasta. Pork is a staple, and most restaurants offer a splendid
variety of potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping inevitably begins at the woodcarvers' stores and
workshops. The union of woodcarvers is known as the St.
Lukasverein, and their work is on display in the center of town.
The head of the union is Christian Wagner, who has his own store,
distinguished by some very attractive wooden bowls and plates.
Crucifixes, crypts and studies of the Virgin and Child abound.
</P>
<P>
   In a different vein, brightly painted spindly wooden toys known
as Jumping Jacks are on sale at Monika Lang's charming store behind
the central Alte Post restaurant. The attractive toys, made from
the stem of a single spruce, are at a minimum of about $100.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lang is well known in town because she led a campaign to
overturn the rule that any woman in the Passion Play had to be
under 35 and unmarried. This Diktat, which stood for over 300
years, was scrapped in 1990, when the Virgin Mary was played by a
mother of two.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lang's sister, Barbara Lampe, has a workshop adjacent to the
store where she carries on a family tradition as a potter. The two
women's grandfather, Anton Lang, played Jesus in 1900, 1910 and
1920. His intense gaze, caught in a photograph, stares out over the
pottery shop, where Ms. Lampe likes to serve herbal tea to a hip
crowd.

   Steven Holl's new museum of contemporary art in Helsinki takes
its name from a neurological configuration that links perception
and conception. That's a good point of departure for an art museum,
and Holl has turned his into a major urban event. He has carved a
set of powerfully sensuous galleries within a curving shell that
animates what was formerly a dead zone in the Finnish capital's
core. &QL;

   HOUSE IN BORDEAUX &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A physically disabled client has inspired Rem Koolhaas to create
a shelter from shelter: a house of concrete, glass and steel that
evades conventional ideas of refuge, comfort and normalcy. The
building's central feature, a 12-foot-square moving platform,
enables the client to move freely among the house's three levels as
it alters the flow of space inside. &QL;

<P>
   Phyllis Lambert, founding director of the Canadian Center for
Architecture, in Montreal, has begun a program aimed at urban
revitalization. Every three years, she will sponsor a juried
competition in a different city. The first, to be held in New York
next year, will invite six architects to develop ideas for the west
side of midtown Manhattan, a district dominated by tunnels,
highways, overpasses and other fragments of urban infrastructure.
If ultimately approved, this would be the first wide-ranging urban
project New York has seen in 30 years. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PAPER PLANT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Think how much fun it would be to read the newspaper if you knew
that the paper it was printed on had been made in a plant designed
by the brilliant young architect Maya Lin. Ms. Lin's plan, as yet
unrealized, would draw on the most advanced recycling technology
and could produce about 50 percent of the newsprint consumed in New
York City. Also, you would be able to look down on the plant from
the Triborough Bridge and see a fountain, using the water required
by the recycling process, glinting in the sun. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ZAHA HADID &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Zaha Hadid's design for the Cincinnati Museum
of Contemporary Art brings further glory to a city already enriched
by recent buildings by Peter Eisenman, Frank Gehry, Michael Graves
and Harry Cobb. Hadid's design recalls one of Klee's magic-square
paintings rendered into three dimensions. A broad ramp-way
switch-backing up one side of the building will convey visitors
past a honeycomb of galleries, while quirky cuts in the floor will
punctuate the 10-story structure with exclamations of light and
space. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GRAND CENTRAL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The great mother of infrastructure, back in all her Beaux-Arts
glory. But with all the fuss being made over the Grand Concourse
and its jade-green astrological ceiling, let us not overlook that
architectural and gustatory gem, the Oyster Bar. With its beautiful
ceiling of vaulted tiles, designed and built by the Guastavinos,
this spot is second only to the Four Seasons in architectural
distinction. James Bond thought it the best restaurant in New York.
Here he first uttered his immortal instruction to the barman:
``Shaken, not stirred.'' Or was it the other way around? Bless the
architects of the restoration, Beyer Blinder Belle, for uncovering
the ramps that lead the weary traveler down to a warming, briny
dish of oyster stew. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ELLSWORTH KELLY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The best architecture show of the year was Matthew Marks'
presentation of ``Sculpture for a Large Wall,'' a 65-foot piece
designed by Ellsworth Kelly in 1957 for the Transportation Building
in Penn Center, the massive urban-renewal project in downtown
Philadelphia. Kelly was paid $200 for his services, and when Marks
encountered the piece, some 40 years after its creation, the
Transportation Building was boarded up. The work represents a
moment when Kelly was committed to an entirely Utopian idea of
collaboration between artists and architects. And even wrenched
loose from its architectural setting, the sculpture retains Kelly's
optimistic view of the power of abstract art. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JENNIFER RAAB &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The low point of this and many other years was reached when
Jennifer Raab, chairwoman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission,
instructed the developer Donald Trump to build a 1930s skyscraper
on the site of the St. Moritz Hotel on Central Park South. A person
who could say such a thing has no business being in landmarks
preservation, because she has no sense of history. She is unable to
distinguish between a landmark and an ersatz version of one, and
she evidently conceives of architecture as a practice tantamount to
arranging throw pillows on a sofa. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   COLISEUM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Skidmore, Owings, Merrill's design for the Coliseum site on
Columbus Circle perfectly epitomizes the architecture of denial.
Modeled after the Majestic and the Century, Irwin S. Chanin's great
apartment towers on Central Park West, this design represents an
utter lack of awareness that New York today differs dramatically
from the city in the 1930s, and that this difference demands
architectural interpretation. In particular, the design denies the
extent to which the city is now governed by congestion, density and
bulk. Should this building rise in its present form, we will all
hate ourselves for tolerating structures so flagrantly out of touch
with the imagination we came here to exercise. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CITY HALL PARK &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the discourse of architecture revolves around the
issue of public space, the mayor of the world's greatest city has
seen fit throughout this year to turn New York into a demonstration
project of anti-public space. Giuliani Stadium has a nice ring, but
the likelihood is that this mayor will be remembered for the
barricades, bollards and fences that he and his police
commissioners have caused to be placed around the town.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane fences, the dirty concrete barricades that now
surround City Hall, do bristle with a certain Gehryesque charm. But
this is no Bilbao. Thick walls and thin skins: this is the driving
sensibility emanating from a public official who had, and lost, the
opportunity to create great public works. In reviewing the record
of this sorry administration, one is tempted to paraphrase
something Edmund Wilson once wrote: There is something going on, on
the higher plane, that halfway compels his respect, but he does not
know what it is, and in any case he can never get up there himself.

   Percussion can be thrilling. Ask anyone who has seen ``Bring In
da Noise, Bring In da Funk,'' Savion Glover's Broadway paean to tap
dancing. Or ``Stomp,'' which consists basically of performers
pounding big sticks on the stage floor. And a movie about a
musician on tour can be fascinating. See Barbara Kopple's ``Wild
Man Blues,'' which follows Woody Allen, clarinetist, on his
European travels. So ``Zakir and His Friends,'' a 90-minute
percussive travelogue with the tabla player Zakir Hussain, had
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie, which begins its two-week run at the Film Forum
Wednesday, has all too few thrills. Lutz Leonhardt, the writer and
director, has chosen to go with the artistic, or what he sees as
artistic, at the expense of clarity.
</P>
<P>
   The result is like a book of photographs without captions _ very
good-looking at times, and thought-provoking, but it raises a
million questions that are never answered. Are we in the Caribbean
now or South America? What's the meaning of the African dance in
which women push and shove their way into the circle in order to
bounce up and down? And in the one truly exciting performance, by a
bare-chested man wielding a drumstick the size of a baseball bat,
is he in Bali or Japan? What's the instrument called? Maybe people
who already can tell a kodo drum from a bongo will have no problem,
but the everyday moviegoer may be a little lost.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's interesting to observe that there's percussion in
everyday life _ laundry being slapped against rocks, the sound of a
machete cutting through jungle greenery, the clack-clack of a
child's wagon on a village street _ but after a few demonstrations,
the point is made, thank you. It's cute to watch little boys create
percussion with just their cheeks, mouths and hands too, but a
little goes a long way.
</P>
<P>
   Hussain himself is another story. He is the Bombay-born son of
Alla Rakha, one of the Indian percussionists. Hussain, who is
baby-boomer age, now lives in California, and his stage
performances in the film establish that his reputation as a player
of tabla, the paired drums of northern India, is well deserved. But
in the end, the film leaves us wanting to know more about him.
</P>
<P>
   In a scene on a train, Hussain tells the story of his first
booking. A letter came to the house offering a concert date to his
father. Zakir wrote back saying that Rakha would not be able to
accept the engagement but that his son was available. Zakir didn't
mention in the letter that he was only 13. It worked, and his
musical career was under way. A self-starter like that probably has
a lot more to say.

 &HT;    Trust and honesty will be put to the test in GeorgiaBy Rhonda
Cook
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As Georgia struggles to balance the increasing cost of
its burgeoning Corrections Department, it is trying a new approach
with people on probation: trust.
</P>
<P>
   In metro Atlanta, Athens and Albany, the state is allowing its
best probationers to work on the honor system by reporting to a
machine, instead of a person.
</P>
<P>
   The probationer goes to a kiosk, usually in a state building or
a county courthouse, inserts a card something like an ATM card and
places his hand on the machine so his fingerprints can be verified.
The parolee then responds electronically to a series of question,
such as whether he or she has used drugs recently. Although the
program is in its second year, the state has no accurate measure of
its success because the states tracks probation recidivism on a
three-year cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Not all members of the criminal justice system think the kiosks
are a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have really hands-on supervision of these folks,''
said Fulton County Superior Court Judge Cynthia Wright.
</P>
<P>
   ``The personal contact is very critical because all the kiosk
can tell you is the offender is still in town and checking in,''
said Marc Mauer of The Sentencing Project in Washington. ``They
could be selling drugs day and night and still be smart enough to
check in with the kiosk. Just like a parent talking to a kid can
pick up on signals that there is a problem, it's the same for a
probation officer. You just can't get that through an electronic
system.''
</P>
<P>
   However, probation officials expects little problems with the
3,000 or so people who choose this route. Because there is an extra
$10 monthly fee for this type of probation reporting system, the
people who do it have to volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Wicklund, executive director of the American Probation and
Parole Association, said New York City had been using the kiosks
successfully for a few years. A few other cities and states are
considering it. As is the case in Georgia, New York City selects
only those most likely to succeed, so there are virtually no
revocations of probation, Wicklund said.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on their answers to the electronic questions,
probationers either are cleared and told to report back at the next
scheduled time or required to meet with a probation officer.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Georgia gets tougher on sentencing inmates and
requiring them to serve more of their sentences, probation rolls
continue to swell. Some researchers have said the rise is simply a
result of demographics, the large numbers of young men in the prime
crime years of the mid-teens to late 20s.
</P>
<P>
   While officers supervising high-security probationers have
relatively lower caseloads, those with only standard cases, which
require probationers to report monthly, supervise an average of
250-300. In Atlanta, the caseload is more than double, with one
officer supervising an average of 650 men and women.
</P>
<P>
   By using the kiosks, the Department of Corrections is taking
some of the pressure off the officers, so they can pay more
attention to those who need a bit more watching.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing prison population and the number of probationers
has sent the Department of Corrections budget from $525.5 million
five years ago to a proposed $952 million for next year. That
increase, in turn, has made state officials look harder at
controlling costs in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Hanness, chief of the Atlanta probation office, said all the
answers are verified, so if probationers lie, their probation is
revoked and they are sent to prison. The probation officer calls to
verify the information, such as employers and residence, so a false
answer will be discovered, Hanness said. For probationers whose
court order requires random or regular drug testing, the office
likewise would be notified if a person did not report for the
testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great,'' said Hanness. ``It's the only way we can
manage the size of the caseload we have. The probationer doesn't
report to the officer unless there's a reason to do so. We were
looking for ways to manage our standard caseloads because that's
the only caseload we don't have a cap on.''

 &HT;    Anderson: Leftover to entree
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Now that you look back upon it, Jamal Anderson is not
the kind of ball carrier a National Football League team expects to
find still hanging around in the seventh round of the college
draft. Twenty-four other running backs had been picked off before
him. Two hundred other players. I can't say how many are still in
the league, but the bottom line is, none is more a treasure to his
team than the Ute from Utah is to the Falcons. Sure to be far
better remembered for something more than the ``Dirty Bird,'' a
sort of ungainly end-zone prance.
</P>
<P>
   He hits like a cement truck. He has the rebounding resilience of
a racquetball. He can cut and he can shimmy. And if he can't make
it that way, he can somehow root out yardage like a burrowing
animal.
</P>
<P>
   You have to stand off at a distance to get a perspective on just
who Anderson was and how far he has come. Looking at it another
way, the Falcons had just traded away their sixth draft choice to
deal with Eric Dickerson, who has Hall of Fame possibilities.
Dickerson never played a down in a Falcons suit.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson had to spend two seasons in the oversized shadow of
Ironhead Heyward and in the ``suicide'' role of returning kickoffs.
If anyone saw such an offensive giant in him, it was a quietly
guarded secret. He leads the National Football Conference in
rushing yards. He has gone toe to toe this season with three of the
ball-carrying union who came out of college with full scrapbooks,
and he has decisioned them all, Garrison Hearst, Marshall Faulk and
the latest, Barry Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Modestly, though, he says, ``It's Barry Sanders and then the
rest of us. But when people talk about the best backs, I don't want
to be left out,'' he told our Curtis Bunn.
</P>
<P>
   It is amazing that he managed to retain his anonymity at Utah,
even when he one-upped Faulk, then at San Diego State, in a bowl
game. To be left hanging there after six rounds of draft? Was he
hiding some mysterious ailment? He surely had connections, for his
boyhood was spent on the inside of Muhammad Ali's entourage. His
father, who has been a New Jersey policeman, became one of Ali's
security force, and Jamal came to know ``The Greatest'' as no other
kid did.
</P>
<P>
   He came out of that relationship with a sense of public
relations. He even understands newspaper people, reads their work,
is delightfully engaging. Not one of those who brassily claims, ``I
never read the papers.''
</P>
<P>
   He shares himself with others, from Shiloh Middle School in
Lithonia to the Project Youth Conference in Los Angeles. He grew up
in the region, went to high school in El Camino, and while there
may be question as to how actively he was recruited, he found his
place in Utah, still has a restaurant in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   His running strength is in his powerful legs and thighs, and a
not-to-be-denied attitude. They say he can lift 670 pounds and
bench press 465 pounds, all of which is impressive only on a body
with quick feet and a runner's attitude. He has become the greatest
running back who ever wore a Falcons uniform, and suffice it to
say, paid one of the richest returns on a seventh-round draft
choice in the history of the NFL. Now, give us a quick ``Dirty
Bird,'' Jamal, as we take our leave.

`THE VINTNER'S LUCK': A RANDY ANGEL MEDDLES, LITERALLY, IN EARTHLY
AFFAIRS
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
 (fb) 
By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The setting and the spare stylistic precision with which
Elizabeth Knox begins ``The Vintner's Luck'' promise an unusual and
savory historical feast. Very quickly, Knox, a New Zealand author
of four previous books, establishes her authority as she evokes the
Burgundian landscape in which her story is set. Her erotically
charged intrigue, which involves an earthbound wine grower named
Sobran Jodeau and a winged visitor from heaven named Xas, promises
a kind of sophisticated, supernaturally tinged mystery embedded in
the fateful soil of 19th-century France.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Knox displays considerable talent throughout this
book, the first of her novels to be published outside New Zealand.
Her early chapters especially have a grainy intensity. A young
woman is murdered, prompting indignation and fear among the local
farmers, including the Comte de Vully, the lord of the nearby
manor. Sobran follows his best friend, a youth named Baptiste
Kalmann, to war with Napoleon, and he experiences the destruction
of the French Army in Russia and the wintry death march home. He
returns to find the angel waiting for him, angry about Sobran's
two-year absence.
</P>
<P>
   But then ``The Vintner's Luck'' seems to lose its momentum, even
as the years in Sobran's life and his ever more successful vintages
pass into decades. Knox seems not to know exactly what to do with
her several themes, the life and loves of Sobran, the several
gruesome murders and the theological symbolism of Xas, who turns
out to be a complicated angel, a kind of compromise emissary from
both God and Lucifer. Knox uses the fermentation of the grapes on
Sobran's hillside vineyards as a metaphor for the ferment of
history and character. The idea is a good one, but the passions of
her characters never seem quite persuasive enough to give her story
the strong and clearly defined aromas she intends.
</P>
<P>
   Knox structures her story over single dates in a long stretch of
years beginning with 1808, which she labels ``Vin Bourru,'' (``New
Wine'') and ending half a century later. We first encounter the
young Sobran, disappointed in love and solacing himself with two
bottles of the family vintage a week after midsummer on a ridge
that marks the border between his and his neighbor's vineyards.
Sobran, who is upset over his failed courtship of Celeste, a maid
in his great-aunt's household with a history of family madness,
sees that somebody has placed a statue on the ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Sobran swoons when he sees that the object is not a statue, and
he falls ``against a warm, firm pillow of muscle,'' the angel Xas'
sheltering wing: ``pure sinew and bone under a cushion of feathers,
complicated and accommodating against his side, hip, leg, the
pinions split around his ankle.'' Xas drinks some of the vin bourru
and tells Sobran to put some aside, so they can drink it together
when it gets old. After giving Sobran some advice about winning the
hand of Celeste, Xas promises to return every year on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Sobran's life thus acquires a secret annual ritual, the descent
from the skies of his angelic partner. He marries Celeste, who
gives birth to one child after another. His business flourishes,
and he becomes well known and respected in his region. When the old
count dies, and his niece, Aurora, takes over the manor, Sobran
becomes not only her estate manager but also her confidant.
</P>
<P>
   Other characters enter the scene, including Sobran's troubled
brother, Leon, and his eldest son, Baptiste. Passion flares between
Sobran and Xas, who quarrel and even wrestle, like the biblical
Jacob and the angel. ``The Vintner's Luck'' is slowly transformed
from a darkly mystical and theological fable into a saga of several
families and an angel, with marriages, betrayals, illnesses, deaths
and tortured on-again, off-again love affairs, both homosexual and
heterosexual, following one another in dizzying but also somewhat
numbing succession.
</P>
<P>
   Knox remains stylistically in command throughout, and she
remains master of the historical circumstances as well, her
evocation of rural life in Burgundy never losing its authentic
feel. What weakens her novel is its drift into a romantic and
sexual melodrama that is supposed to involve towering passions but
seems strangely plodding and contrived. Unlike Xas, Knox's dialogue
sometimes fails to take flight, partly because the characters often
seem to be expressing a motiveless quarrelsomeness that is
portentous in form but is unjustified by the action of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Finally there is the presence of Xas himself, an interesting
device but one that never rises to any dramatic purpose that would
warrant Knox's insertion of a fanciful, supernatural character into
what is otherwise a very earthbound, naturalistic setting. At times
Xas, involved in some murky way in the great conflict between God
and Lucifer, seems a sardonic commentary on the Christian
iconography of Milton or Dante. At other times, he appears as a
Roman-god version of a Christian saint, not a figure of grandeur or
wisdom but a meddler in human lives who becomes hopelessly
entangled in them.
</P>
<P>
   Xas, whose role in the second half of the story bears almost no
connection with his supernatural origins, becomes an earthly
wanderer and a figure in a menage a trois that is not made
especially gripping by the presence of a semiheavenly participant.
</P>
<P>
   Knox clearly can fabricate a strange tale, but in this one she
has not succeeded in exploiting the interesting possibilities
present at the beginning.

`THE THIN RED LINE': MALICK ON BEAUTY AND WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A thrilling sense of deja vu accompanies the lush Edenic images
that provide ``The Thin Red Line'' with its prologue in paradise.
Even if they could be watched without knowledge of their
provenance, they would be instantly identifiable as the work of
Terrence Malick, whose 1970s ``Badlands'' and ``Days of Heaven''
were the most beautiful and elusive films of their time. Malick's
subsequent two decades in cinema limbo may have turned him into a
figure of hype-inviting mystery, but it's immediately obvious that
they have not dimmed his visual genius. It's as if a familiar voice
had never left off speaking as, at long last, Malick's huge new
opus begins.
</P>
<P>
   His intoxication with natural beauty, fused so palpably and
strangely with the psychic sleepwalking of his human characters,
remains exactly as it was. So does the innate momentousness that
has always come so easily to Malick's filmmaking. Here is a
visceral reminder of all that made his past work so hauntingly
majestic, even if this movie's difficulties will soon announce
themselves with equal clarity. Intermittently brilliant as it is,
``The Thin Red Line'' shows why being a great film director and
directing a great film are not the same.
</P>
<P>
   Having envisioned an adaptation of James Jones' famous
Guadalcanal novel since at least 1988, Malick has had time to drift
far afield of his original idea and into something hazier. Though
its starting point was a book full of gut reactions and detailed
particulars, Malick has moved the material to a different plane.
Disjointed poetic effects and ravishing physical beauty now
supplant the nuts and bolts of wartime experience, even if this
film _ like ``Saving Private Ryan,'' with which it happens so
bizarrely to overlap _ depicts a military landing on a beach and a
terrifying assault on a hillside bunker. For all their surface
similarities, Steven Spielberg's film was about character and
Malick's is about spirit.
</P>
<P>
   As ``The Thin Red Line'' contemplates mankind's
self-destructiveness, the oneness of a company of soldiers, the
rape of nature and the emptiness of Pyrrhic victory on the
battlefield, it leaves behind any ordinary opportunities for
individuals to emerge from the fray. Actors here, whether famous or
unknown, are concealed behind helmets and grime as they move _
often wordlessly _ through the initially unspoiled landscape of
this Pacific island. As filmed magnificently by John Toll (with the
Daintree rain forest in Queensland, Australia, doubling for the
actual site), ``The Thin Red Line'' seems to capture every blade of
grass gloriously while also reminding the audience over two and
three-quarter hours how very many blades of grass are here.
</P>
<P>
   Though the U.S.-Japanese battle played out here was one of
pivotal importance during World War II, its strategic value is not
really the heart of the matter here. Indeed, the fury of battle
often fades away as this film's indistinct principals venture into
their own private thoughts. Hence the married man (Ben Chaplin) who
faces battle thinking of his bride and reciting in typically dreamy
voice-over: ``Why should I be afraid to die? I belong to you. If I
go first I'll wait for you on the other side of the dark waters. Be
with me now.'' Malick can accompany even the most sentimental
reveries with lofty phrasings and lovely imagery, like this man's
visions of his sweetheart in summer dresses. She has purity,
sensuality and lightness that would be rare in any film.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thin Red Line'' will as easily fascinate those attuned to
Malick's artistry as it disappoints anyone in search of a plot. For
all the marquee power of its stellar cast and the story's potential
for high drama, remarkably little happens. As in ``Saving Private
Ryan,'' violence erupts with shocking randomness for soldiers at
the battle site, but it is interspersed with meditative passages,
glimpses of the island's indigenous life, and near-wordless
passages propelled by the eloquent forboding of Hans Zimmer's
score. The way light filters through the canopy of the rain forest
means at least as much here as the specifics of battle.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Nolte, giving yet another ferocious performance in his own
personal banner year (he can be seen to devastating effect in next
week's ``Affliction''), joins Sean Penn, Elias Koteas and Woody
Harrelson (whose death scene here is among the film's most
accessible, wrenching moments) as stars who manage to emerge with
strong personalities intact. But no one here has a role with much
continuity, since the film's editing shows off the performers to
such poor advantage. ``The Thin Red Line'' is one more film that
could have been helped by excising repetition and focusing
performances, but it wanders almost randomly instead. The
heart-piercing moments that punctuate its rambling are glimpses of
what a tighter film might have been.
</P>
<P>
   Among the unfamiliar actors in a position to make their marks
here, James Caviezel supplies a handsome, beatific countenance to
suit his character's fervent meditations on flawed humanity. (``How
did we lose the good that was given us? Let it slip away.
Scattered. Careless. What's keeping us from reaching out, touching
the glory?'') Red-haired Dash Mihok, as the private named Doll,
provides the film's strongest visual sense of battlefield chaos.
And Adrien Brody plays one of the novel's major figures, Cpl. Fife,
virtually without a peep. Like the film's leading Johns _ Cusack as
a captain, Savage as a crazed sergeant and Travolta, believe it or
not, as a brigadier general _ Brody simply gets lost in the hubbub
that surrounds him.
</P>
<P>
   The glorious Melanesian scenes that provide both the film's
divine serenity (and its signs of destruction) amount to nature
photography as exquisite as it is redundant. Brilliantly colored
birds, greenery in silhouette, shards of light and idyllic
underwater swimming _ not to mention a soundtrack layered with
sounds of the rain forest _ are among reasons to admire ``The Thin
Red Line'' despite its habits of meandering. As was surely Malick's
intent, those sensations matter as much as life or death here, to
the point where they are inextricably intertwined. He brings that
simple, essential message on his long-overdue return.
</P>

   UTA! &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One name is enough to identify the incomparable Uta Hagen, the
star who gives brilliance to the revival of Donald Margulies'
``Collected Stories'' at the Lucille Lortel Theater. She made her
Broadway debut in ``The Seagull'' with the Lunts in 1938 and has
been gathering momentum ever since in such roles as Desdemona
(opposite Paul Robeson), St. Joan, Blanche Dubois and Martha (in
``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'').
</P>
<P>
   In ``Collected Stories,'' she plays a writer whose life is
stolen through a betrayal of trust. How to describe this woman of
the American theater? Iconic is too fancy. Maybe, earthy, elegant,
funny and fiercely intelligent, someone as sensitive as new skin,
who has the force of a tornado.
</P>
<P>
   HAIL JULIE TAYMOR
</P>
<P>
   The director and designer's vision turned ``The Lion King'' (at
the New Amsterdam Theater) into a seminal Broadway event, a musical
that ennobles its animated film source and expands the
possibilities of the living theater. When next you hear anyone rail
against government support of the arts, remember that Ms. Taymor's
talents were shaped and refined during her long apprenticeship in
the nonprofit theater.
</P>
<P>
   `WIT'
</P>
<P>
   Death is proud in Margaret Edson's very fine play at the Union
Square Theater, but it is met head-on in the text and in Kathleen
Chalfant's rich, gutsy performance. She plays a Donne scholar who
is dying of ovarian cancer and not giving up ground without a
fight. Here is a one-of-a-kind experience: wise, thoughtful, witty
and wrenching.
</P>
<P>
   `ON THE TOWN' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Joseph Papp Public Theater revival of the classic 1944
musical (at the Gershwin), directed by George C. Wolfe, brings the
show back to Broadway in grand style. A joyous feast of bountiful
proportions, with its score by Leonard Bernstein and book and
lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green.
</P>
<P>
   The new choreography may not be the equal of the original by
Jerome Robbins, but it keeps the dancers aloft much of the time
without benefit of wires. The cast is headed by Lea DeLaria, a
powerhouse new personality who clearly comes from the same galaxy
as the legendary E. Merman.
</P>
<P>
   EVERETT QUINTON
</P>
<P>
   Let's hear it for the director and co-star (with Stephen DeRosa)
of the revival of Charles Ludlam's spoof of Hollywood kitsch ``The
Mystery of Irma Vep,'' at the Westside Theater. Low comedy of high
order. Though Quinton often plays women's roles, he is not a
conventional female impersonator. There is never any mistaking the
man behind the heaving bosom for a woman. He is a superb comic
actor and the results are priceless.
</P>
<P>
   NATASHA RICHARDSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The actress has long since left the Roundabout Theater Company's
excellent revival of ``Cabaret'' (now at Studio 54). Yet her
performance as Sally Bowles, the young Englishwoman on the loose in
Weimar Berlin, remains vivid as one of the highlights of this
calendar year. Ms. Richardson is a complete stage performer: she
can act, she can sing and she possesses a stage presence that
dazzles. From now on, I hear only her distinctively sweet-husky,
edge-of-the-abyss voice singing Sally's sarcastic, self-defining
Fred Ebb and John Kander songs.
</P>
<P>
   MAN OF THE YEAR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the alternate universe that is the theater, Garth Drabinsky
takes the title, though not in the way he might have planned. In
the 1980s, the Canadian entrepreneur put together a huge chain of
movie theaters, in part by promising patrons real butter on their
popcorn. When he lost that business, he decided to conquer the
stage by creating his own shows for his own theaters, like an
oldtime movie tycoon.
</P>
<P>
   In January, he opened his new Ford Center for the Performing
Arts on Broadway with ``Ragtime,'' which is still doing good
business. Yet cash flow problems developed. His new partners
charged that the books had been cooked. Before the year's end,
Drabinsky's Livent company was in bankruptcy and he was ousted.
With lawsuits filed by all sides, the future is in doubt. Much
drama, but most of it offstage. Can one say Happy New Year?
</P>
<P>
   `THE CHAIRS' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The best, most satisfying, funniest revival of a straight play
on Broadway this year: Eugene Ionesco's 1951 absurdist comedy, in
the London production directed by Simon McBurney and starring
Geraldine McEwan and Richard Briers. I saw it three times and would
go back again if it were still available.
</P>
<P>
   `ART' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The best, most satisfying, funniest new play on Broadway this
year: Yasmina Reza's French comedy, beautifully translated by
Christopher Hampton, about three middle-aged, middle-class
Parisians whose friendship unravels when one of them buys a $40,000
painting to which the other two object. The subject is not art but
the politics of friendship, which are more brutal than those of
nation-states and are understood everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   `THE CAPEMAN' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remember the show? Don't forget its Paul Simon score, the most
original, melodic and evocative words and music to be heard on a
Broadway stage this year. Yet Simon the musician was hopelessly
sabotaged by Simon the not-so-knowing man of the theater, who
oversaw all aspects of the messy production and found collaboration
a difficulty. That score still exists. Someday it could possibly
make a great show. Hope.

   MEXICO-DRUGS (Washington) _ An ambitious United States effort to
help train and equip Mexico's armed forces to pursue drug smugglers
is in a shambles, officials of both countries say, souring American
relations with an ally that Washington has worked intensely to
court. By Tim Golden. With graphic. 1,400 words.
</P>
<P>
   ANGOLA-WAR (Luena, Angola) _ In this little town in eastern
Angola there is little doubt that a war, which had been dormant for
nearly four years, has begun again. The peace treaty that gave
Angola, a country rich in diamond and oil deposits, its longest
cease-fire in 30 years is in shambles. Since June the Unita rebel
forces have retaken more than half the countryside, engaging the
Angolan Army in hundreds of places and flushing more than 200,000
Angolans from their villages. By Suzanne Daley. With map. 1,654
words. (MOVED)
</P>
<P>
   ELDERLY-SEX (Clearwater, Fla.) _ The dating game never stops.
For couples who move to retirement communities, it abruptly resumes
after a decades-long hiatus as soon as one spouse dies. The need
for companionship, tenderness, love and, yes, sex, remains as
important as ever, but the rules of the game have changed. One
woman described her dream man: ``I would like a note from his
doctor stating that he's healthy _ or if he isn't, that he only has
six months to live.'' She paused. ``And he has to drive at night.''
By Sara Rimer. 1,800 words.

<P>
   IMPEACH-POLL (Undated) _ In virtually every major poll taken in
recent weeks, the people who believe that President Clinton should
be removed from office show up in the minority. But they are
clearly resolute in their opinion, with most saying that the
president lied both under oath and in his famous early
pronouncement to the nation that he ``did not have sexual relations
with that woman,'' and that such lies are automatic grounds for
dismissal. By Sam Howe Verhovek. With graphic.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ If there was anything that brought unity to the
fractious Israeli Parliament, it was bringing down Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu in the overwhelming majority vote on Monday to
dissolve the government two years early.
</P>
<P>
   There was no clearer image of a leader alone than Netanyahu on
the floor of parliament, with a single colleague, Justice Minister
Tsahi Hanegbi, sitting stone-faced by his side. Nearby, legislators
gathered in big, voluble groupings, crossing party lines in
spirited conversation, even bonhomie.
</P>
<P>
   When the prime minister rose to deliver his 11th-hour pitch for
a unity government, members of parliament laughed loudly and
mockingly. Sinking back into his seat, Netanyahu tore paper into
confetti-like shreds, his face frozen in a pallid smirk as the
leader of the opposition Labor Party, Ehud Barak, turned him down.
</P>
<P>
   A newspaper opinion poll published Tuesday showed the prime
minister facing certain defeat in new elections next spring.
</P>
<P>
   In general the newspapers, which Netanyahu constantly maligns
and says he does not read, buried him with unrestrained glee that
he had finally gotten his comeuppance.
</P>
<P>
   ``His hubris, his paranoia and his arrogance have proved to be
his downfall,'' Yoel Marcus wrote in a column in the daily Haaretz.
``He finds himself without partners, without friends.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet. Although the political body came together in the vote
on Monday night, it is expected to splinter now onto one of the
broadest playing fields in the country's electoral history, where
no outcome is predictable.
</P>
<P>
   The columnists and the pollsters were certainly clueless the
last time, in 1996. Until the final moment, they underestimated the
shrewd and charismatic campaign skills of Netanyahu. An outsider,
he stirred together a stew of those outside the corridors of power
long controlled by the Ashkenazic elite: the strictly Orthodox, the
Sephardic working class, the Russian immigrants and the far-right
ideologues.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is one thing that can be said with certainty about
the prime minister, it is that always, but always, it is too early
to eulogize him,'' Hemi Shalev, a political analyst, wrote in the
newspaper Maariv.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, before the vote, Netanyahu had given up lobbying. His
office was empty except for security guards. He met only with
Hanegbi and Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, who not only remained by
his side but sometimes out in front of him, the stern father figure
of the right, scolding the unfaithful deserters.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu appeared utterly isolated within the political
establishment. But he still may prove adept as ever at wooing a
workingman in a development town or a Jewish settler in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Playing to their fears, he appears ready to hammer home the same
themes he struck during the 1996 election: only Netanyahu will
protect Israel from the Palestinians, save Jerusalem from being
divided, keep the terrorists at bay.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, after having signed a peace agreement in
Washington in October promising to turn over to the Palestinians a
significant chunk of the West Bank, his campaign is tinged with
what some see as a cynical pragmatism: Where else are they going to
turn?
</P>
<P>
   In a rush to provide alternatives, his former allies, like his
opponents, are quickly splintering. Parliament, now made up of 11
parties, may include 19 by the time elections are held.
</P>
<P>
   Having alienated many among the right wing and within his own
party, both on ideological principle and personally, Netanyahu
faces defections from a host of former supporters and from within
his own Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   It is a surge that could prove to be the undoing of the old
Likud, which defined itself as the party opposed to territorial
compromise until it ended up backing the land-for-security peace
plan this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Scions of the old Likud aristocracy are jumping ship.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Netanyahu's former finance minister, Dan Meridor, quit
the Likud and announced his intention to run for prime minister,
scathingly denouncing his former boss for what he called
``cynicism, manipulation and cockiness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The lie has become a system,'' he said, using what for him is
unusually strong language. ``Truth has disappeared and broken
promises have become the norm.''
</P>
<P>
   Another former minister, Benny Begin, son of the late Prime
Minister Menachem Begin, is expected to form a new right-wing party
and also go up against Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Within Likud, Communications Minister Limor Livnat is expected
to battle Netanyahu for leadership, as will Uzi Landau, a former
supporter and hard-line member of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In a radio interview Tuesday, Netanyahu derided the bustle among
his former allies to replace him, seeming as cocksure as ever.
``The fantasies and ambitions of all those who want to be prime
minister _ please,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It does not escape his notice that the left may start out as
fragmented as the right. Barak, a former general, is forced to
confront a significant challenge from another former general, the
popular Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, who is expected to declare his
candidacy for prime minister as the leader of an as of yet
undeclared, unnamed centrist party.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that center party merges with Meridor's center party or
remains separate is still unclear. But what is clear is that not
only Likud but Labor too risks hemorrhaging support into a new
undefined center. Lipkin-Shahak was said to be willing to join
forces with Barak; both are former proteges of the late Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin. But Lipkin-Shahak was reportedly unwilling
to align himself with Labor because he considers the party tired
and disconnected from voters.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Russian immigrants are expected to split, with some
remaining behind Natan Sharansky, the trade minister, and others
aligning behind the Soviet-born Avigdor Lieberman, Netanyahu's
former chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``So long as we continue down this road, it will be difficult to
build a stable government,'' said Shlomo Ben Ami, a historian and
Labor Party member of parliament. ``The big parties will further
disintegrate, and we will end up with either personality politics
or special interest politics or both.''
</P>
<P>
   Some blame Israel's peculiar election reforms, which brought
Netanyahu to power in the first direct popular election for a prime
minister here. The members of parliament were elected on a separate
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu cobbled together a coalition of parties to insure what
ended up as his razor-thin majority in parliament, but the small
parties were able to hold major votes hostage to their
constituents' demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole issue of governance is almost down the tubes,'' said
Arye Carmon, a historian and president of the Israel Democracy
Institute. ``It's a fragmentation that is terrible for Israeli
democracy. Instead of struggling for the benefit of the nation,
members of Parliament are thinking narrowly, in terms of, say,
money for Orthodox yeshivas or housing for the Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   Before voting to dissolve the government on Monday, parliament
also voted to overturn the direct elections law in a preliminary
bill. As of now, however, the bill will not affect this spring's
elections, when the two major parties could be put to a real test.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is very fluid now,'' said Michael Eitan, a Likud
stalwart in parliament. ``It's a new dimension of Israeli politics,
more personal, less ideological and less partisan. Who will
benefit? Time will tell.''

 &HT;        CLINTON'S LEGAL DEFENSE FUND GETS STEADY DONATIONS, BUT
LEGAL FEES GROW   By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Dec. 21, -- The impeachment process could not only
cost President Bill Clinton his job, but also a small fortune in
legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons already owe $7 million and counting in lawyer's
bills from the Paula Jones sexual harassment case and Whitewater
land deal investigation, according to Tony Essaye, executive
director of the Clinton Legal Expense Trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anyone with those kind of legal fees would be
incredibly concerned,'' said Essaye, who oversees a trust of
private donations collected to help pay for the Clintons' legal
costs. ``We are doing the best we can to meet this enormous
potential burden to the Clintons. We are cautiously optimistic
about what we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   The trust had raised only $2.2 million as of August, the last
time numbers were made available.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the White House and Essaye said they didn't know
yet how much the impeachment process has cost Clinton in personal
legal fees. They also could not estimate the cost of a Senate
trial.
</P>
<P>
   In his official capacity, Clinton is represented by the White
House counsel, which is paid for by taxpayers, Essaye said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton must pay fees to his private lawyer, David Kendall,
whom he hired to assist the White House counsel in defending him,
Essaye said.
</P>
<P>
   The government will wind up paying most costs related to the
impeachment process. But if the $900,000 the House Judiciary
Committee spent pursuing Clinton in the impeachment inquiry alone
is any indication, he will have to pay plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's insurance policy paid off the $850,000 settlement in
the Paula Jones case, according to a White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the presidential legal bill was $6 million. The trust
had collected $2.2 million dollars and paid out 1.25 million to the
president's lawyers, Essaye said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president would have to pay any amount leftover from what
we could not pay,'' Essaye said. ``Of course, the president could
always make money doing lectures and appearances when he leaves
office. But I think there is a better use of his time.''
</P>
<P>
   During the impeachment process, the trust has received a
``steady flow of donations,'' from individuals allowed to
contribute up to $10,000 a year. Essaye said the trust received
calls from folks concerned with Clinton's bills.
</P>
<P>
   Essaye would not release information about how much money has
been raised since August and said the next figures would be made
available in February.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for the trust, Richard M. Lucas, said he was
confident the donations would ``substantially'' reduce the amount
owed by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's approval rating has been high and people want
to help him,'' Lucas said. ``There have been no peaks or valleys in
donations.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas said he didn't think Clinton's impeachment battle needed
publicity. The direct mailings soliciting donations for Clinton's
legal bills don't mention it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donors are well aware of what they [the Clintons] are going
through.'' Lucas said.

FLOOD OF GIFTS OFFERED FOR HOUSTON OCTUPLETS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK LYMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ As the eight babies born to a Houston woman on Sunday
struggled to survive as the first known living octuplets, donors
from around Texas and across the country pledged money and goods to
help the new family.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been no significant changes in the babies'
conditions,'' said Leonard Weisman, chief of neonatalogy at Texas
Children's Hospital, where the six girls and two boys remain under
sedation and on a diet of sugar and water. ``In these cases, no
news is good news.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Texas Children's Hospital, where the babies
remained in critical but stable condition, and at the adjacent St.
Luke's Episcopal Hospital, where the octuplets' mother, Nkem
Chukwu, 27, is described as alert and excited following surgery to
correct internal bleeding, say they have received a steady stream
of calls and packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gotten a lot of interest, though I think some people
around the country are waiting to see how the babies do,'' said
Katy Gill, director of development at Texas Children's Hospital.
``In this case, because the babies are so critical, a lot of people
may be waiting to see if they survive.''
</P>
<P>
   A Houston-based food chain, Randall's Food Markets, has donated
a year's worth of groceries for the Chukwus. A national company,
Drypers, has donated a lifetime supply of baby wipes and disposable
training pants. Another company, which asked to remain anonymous,
donated a lifetime supply of diapers. Mead Johnson Nutritionals
donated a year's worth of infant formula.
</P>
<P>
   The producers of Maury Povich's television show, ``The New Maury
Show,'' have arranged to provide eight cribs to hold the Chukwu
children. Holt Educational Outlet, manufacturers and distributors
of educational toys, say they will donate a full array of toys as
soon as it is clear what products best fit the children's needs.
Foley's, the department store chain, called the hospital (``as they
always do in these cases,'' Ms. Gill said) and said they would
provide what the family needed in baby car seats or infant clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The most unusual call, said Mari Anne Dwyer, assistant director
of hospital philanthropy at St. Luke's, came from Excalibur Tire
and Wheel, a Houston chain of auto supply stores, offering the
Chukwus a lifetime supply of tires and oil changes. ``It's so
sweet,'' Ms. Dwyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chukwu, who had been trying to have children for several
years and had miscarried triplets earlier this year, learned 12
weeks into her pregnancy that she was carrying multiple embryos,
but declined for religious reasons to allow doctors to reduce the
number of embryos.
</P>
<P>
   The sensational nature of the case _ marking the fifth known
time in the world that more than seven children were delivered and
the only known time that all have survived _ has revived the debate
among doctors over the ethical use of fertility drugs when
so-called high order multiple births, triplets or more, most often
end in tragedy for at least some of the children.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials said Tuesday that many of the calls came from
individuals who wanted to give money to the new family. Ms. Dwyer
said that St. Luke's Hospital would accept checks made payable to
the Chukwu Family Fund until a more permanent fund for the family
can be set up in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Chido Nwangwu, the Houston-based publisher of two
national magazines and two Internet sites aimed at Africans and
black Americans, said he was trying to rally support in the black
community for the octuplets' parents, both American citizens born
in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our thought is to stimulate the spirit of community service
and volunteerism for all people, regardless of race or culture,''
Nwangwu said. ``And we want particularly to make certain that these
children get the same kind of support, regardless of their culture,
that have been given to other multiple-birth babies in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chukwu and her husband, Iyke, a respiratory therapist in
Houston, have asked hospital officials to shield them and their
babies from the dozens of reporters and television crews camped
outside the hospitals and they have allowed no pictures and given
no interviews.

U.S. PLAN TO HELP MEXICAN MILITARY FIGHT DRUGS IS FALTERING

<TEXT>
<P>
   An ambitious U.S. effort to help train and equip Mexico's armed
forces to pursue drug smugglers is in a shambles, officials of both
countries say, souring U.S. relations with an ally that Washington
has worked intensely to court.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after the Pentagon began donating dozens of
helicopters to the Mexican army and training hundreds of Mexican
soldiers in the United States, officials have seen only a handful
of the anti-drug operations intended in the program. The helicopter
fleet has been grounded by mechanical problems, and angry Mexican
generals are sharply cutting the number of troops they will send to
train.
</P>
<P>
   According to U.S. intelligence reports, the drug flights that
the plan was designed to combat have virtually ceased. But that
appears to be because the traffickers turned to smuggling schemes
like containerized shipping before the enforcement strategy ever
got off the ground. The flow of drugs into the United States has
continued apace.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions over the failed strategy, the faltering equipment and
continuing reports of Mexican military corruption have grown
serious enough, U.S. officials said, that they have asked Mexico's
commanding generals to reassess the program altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question, basically, is: How do we get out of this box?''
a Clinton administration official said. ``We will talk about the
plan that they come up with, and we will talk about whether we want
to support that plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflict underscores the competing agendas that the Pentagon
and the CIA have encountered in Latin America as they have tried to
use the fight against international drug traffickers to remake
their old alliances with military forces in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Like its counterparts in Colombia and Peru _ and like the
Pentagon itself _ the Mexican military seized on the drug fight as
a mission of growing importance and as a way to protect its budgets
after the Cold War. But the Mexican commanders have pursued the
effort with secrecy and independence, raising questions about
whether the United States is strengthening powerful and sometimes
autonomous military forces at the expense of civilian institutions
like the courts and the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer here is that there is no silver bullet,'' said Jan
Lodal, who, until his recent retirement as the principal deputy
undersecretary of defense for policy, oversaw the Pentagon's
anti-drug cooperation with Mexico. ``You are going to have to build
an effective civilian law-enforcement structure, and you're going
to have to build it from the ground up.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Administration officials contend that despite the tensions, the
United States' relationship with the Mexican armed forces is better
than it was several years ago. They say that the CIA's
collaboration with a small drug-intelligence unit of the Mexican
army, while largely secret, has been reasonably successful. And
they emphasize that they turned to the Mexican military only after
President Ernesto Zedillo did so himself, giving his generals a new
public security role because the corrupting influence of the drug
trade had so paralyzed the federal police.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials are still quick to say any
long-term solution to Mexico's criminal-justice problems must focus
on civilian institutions. But they also continue to spend
considerably more on anti-drug training for the military than they
have on court officers and the police, and they have largely
approved as the Mexican armed forces have steadily expanded their
influence over a range of law-enforcement programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the start, all of us have believed that if you don't have
a judicial system and a police force that are responsive to the
elected civilian leadership, you're in trouble,'' the White House
drug policy director, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, said in an interview.
But he added, ``You don't produce the Swiss police in a year.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said that when they first offered to support the
Mexican military's drug-enforcement efforts in early 1995, they
imagined a narrower role. Colombian drug traffickers had begun
flying huge loads of cocaine into Mexico on stripped-down passenger
jets, easily outrunning Mexican police aircraft, and U.S. officials
started by asking Mexican commanders to use their small fleet of
F-5 fighter jets to intercept the smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   The F-5 plan was unsuccessful, but Pentagon officials soon
proposed a more elaborate one. That October, when William Perry
became the first defense secretary to visit Mexico in years,
Mexican generals agreed to begin U.S. training for special-forces
troops that would chase traffickers to clandestine air strips and
remote safe houses.
</P>
<P>
   To transport the soldiers on their raids, the Pentagon
eventually donated 73 aging UH-1H helicopters, part of an equipment
transfer worth about $58 million. The United States also gave
Mexico's air force four C-26 surveillance planes and sold the
Mexican navy two Knox-class frigates. Finally, the two militaries
agreed to consider further cooperation in areas like disaster
relief, education and force modernization.
</P>
<P>
   Since late 1995, however, U.S. officials say they have not
detected a single jetload of cocaine flying into Mexico. In fact,
they say, drug flights into Mexico have stopped altogether as the
traffickers have shifted to maritime shipments through the Gulf of
Mexico, into the Yucatan peninsula and up the Pacific coast, and to
overland transportation, mainly by truck.
</P>
<P>
   With no planes to chase, Mexican commanders have used the
helicopters for everything from troop transport to spraying
herbicides on drug crops. But the Vietnam-era aircraft have been
plagued by mechanical problems and a lack of spare parts, and
Mexico announced in March that it would ground the entire fleet
after the U.S. Army found engine problems in all the UH-1H models.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials have complained privately that they were given
scrap. Pentagon officials say the problems stem from excessive and
improper use of the helicopters by the Mexican army.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials also complain that the frigates they bought
two years ago for $7 million have been unusable until recently
because they were delivered without needed equipment. A
long-promised system set up to share the Pentagon's drug
intelligence directly with the Mexican military has been kept
off-line because of lingering U.S. fears that sources of the
information might be compromised.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And despite U.S. hopes that anti-drug programs would bring the
two militaries closer together, Mexican generals have told the
Defense Department that they are no longer interested in other
joint projects like disaster-relief planning.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Pentagon officials have questioned the Mexican
army's use of the special-forces troops they helped to design and
train. In September, the attorney general's office announced the
arrest of nine special-forces soldiers after an investigation
linked them to alien-smuggling and other crimes. While their unit
was not trained in the United States, U.S. officials were
nonetheless critical of its mission: they had been seconded to the
federal drug-enforcement police, to check luggage at the Mexico
City airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's certainly not what we're training them for,'' a
Pentagon official said.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials say that there is no practical way they can
monitor how Mexican troops trained by the United States are
deployed, although such a plan has been required in Colombia to try
to keep U.S. aid and training from going to counterinsurgency
troops or human rights violators.
</P>
<P>
   But the greatest frustration for U.S. officials may be the way
that Mexican commanders have responded to the difficulties in the
program and the public scrutiny that has come with it.
</P>
<P>
   Saying they do not need or can no longer afford training for
many of the helicopter mechanics, sailors and special-forces troops
they had planned to send to U.S. bases, Mexican military officials
have said they will cut the flow of troops by about 40 percent over
the next year. Mexico's only cost for the program is a meal
allowance for each soldier of $25 a day, U.S. officials said.

ETHICS INQUIRY HOLDS UP HOLBROOKE'S U.N. NOMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ With the opening here this week of a debate
that could change the way the world does business with Iraq, the
Clinton administration's choice to lead the U.S. delegation is
still under investigation by the Justice Department and unlikely to
take up that post in the foreseeable future, officials said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, who has yet to be formally nominated by the
White House, would have to be confirmed by the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, and the Senate has now begun the
time-consuming issue of impeachment. Congressional aides predicted
that the nomination process could take months.
</P>
<P>
   A. Peter Burleigh, a career diplomat of ambassadorial rank, has
been filling in since August.
</P>
<P>
   Burleigh, an expert on Asia and the Middle East who nearly
became ambassador to Baghdad before the Persian Gulf War broke out,
has been piloting the U.S. mission here through a season of
multiple crises _ in Iraq, Kosovo, Congo and Libya, to name a few.
The deputy to Bill Richardson, who left the top U.N. job in August
to become energy secretary, Burleigh was expected to fill in
briefly until Holbrooke's nomination cleared the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But an anonymous letter to the State Department's inspector
general last summer set off a federal ethics inquiry into charges
that Holbrooke had benefited illegally from contacts with former
State Department colleagues after he left the foreign service in
1996 to become vice chairman of Credit Suisse First Boston, a New
York investment bank. Holbrooke's lawyer, Richard Beattie, said he
expected Holbrooke to be cleared of all charges.
</P>
<P>
   The chief American representative at the United Nations, a
position that always carries the rank of ambassador and often
includes membership in the president's Cabinet, routinely goes to a
political appointee, often someone with close ties to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Other ambassadors are of two minds about the political nature of
the relationship. It can mean that the U.S. representative is often
away in Washington and not attending to U.N. issues. At the same
time, diplomats say, it is useful to know immediately and directly
through the U.S. representative what an administration in
Washington is thinking.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to political ties, Holbrooke has had a long and
distinguished foreign career. A former ambassador and high-ranking
State Department official, he has most recently been President
Clinton's troubleshooter in the Balkans, responsible for
engineering the Dayton accord that ended the war in Bosnia and for
persuading President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia to relax the
siege of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Burleigh said in an interview last month that there are
advantages to being a career diplomat here. Most other nations,
including all four permanent members of the Security Council _
Britain, China, France and Russia _ are represented by career
foreign service officers for whom the United Nations is one of the
best ambassadorial jobs.
</P>
<P>
   When the press criticized the Clinton administration for leaving
the top U.S. diplomatic post open after the departure of
Richardson, Burleigh said, his colleagues on the Security Council
rallied to his defense.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, through the biggest crisis of all, Iraq, Burleigh
has had the advantage of having worked a decade ago with Nizar
Hamdoon, Iraq's U.N. representative. Hamdoon, who is about to
return to Baghdad, was Iraqi ambassador in Washington during
critical years of the Iran-Iraq war, when Burleigh was the deputy
assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern and South Asian
Affairs, and the United States was backing Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   He said he remembers Hamdoon as ``an excellent ambassador.'' But
they had not spoken for a decade when they were suddenly thrown
together in mid-November. Burleigh, as president of the Security
Council, had to persuade the Iraqis to write a series of
conciliatory letters that ultimately allowed the United States to
call off an earlier round of military attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Hamdoon, who is normally frozen out of all contact with U.S.
officials, became Burleigh's willing conduit to Baghdad.

UN THREATENS VETO IF IRAQI SANCTIONS EASED 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The United States threatened to use its veto
power in the UN Security Council to thwart a series of diplomatic
initiatives aimed at easing economic sanctions and dismantling the
UN weapons inspection unit for Iraq. But in an attempt to win
international support for its containment policy, Washington said
it would allow Iraq to sell more oil to buy food and humanitarian
goods.
</P>
<P>
   The US move was designed to quash attempts by Russia, China and
France to lift sanctions on Iraq in the wake of the American
bombing campaign. And Washington aims to head off proposals from
the United Nations and France to replace the UN Special Commission
for Iraq with a less confrontational arms inspection entity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly oppose any effort to dismantle the sanctions
regime, and if it means using the veto, we would,'' White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Pickering, the undersecretary of State for political
affairs, meanwhile, provided the most detailed outline yet of
America's diplomatic strategy in the wake of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering, in a 45-minute press conference at the State
Department, stopped short of pledging to use military force to
compel Iraq to allow the UN inspectors back. But he demanded that
Iraq submit to inspections by the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) or
endure economic sanctions ``into perpetuity.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickering said that the United States would only bomb Iraq again
if it attacked the Kurdish minority, threatened its neighbors or
tried to reconstitute its nuclear, chemical or biological weapons
program.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Pickering traveled to New York to warn UN, Russian
and French diplomats that they would be ``wasting their time'' if
they tried to dismantle UNSCOM or ease the eight-year-old economic
embargo imposed on Baghdad after it invaded Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Following a closed-door meeting of the Security Council Tuesday,
Russian Ambassador Sergei Lavrov lobbied the council to engage UN
Secretary General Kofi Annan more directly in managing the UN
relationship with Iraq. Russia has long favored a stronger role for
Annan, who is more sympathetic to the Iraqi case than UNSCOM
chairman Richard Butler.
</P>
<P>
   Lavrov also pressed the council to ask Annan to assess the
impact of the American bombing campaign. He also proposed convening
a meeting of the 22 political UNSCOM commissioners to consider the
inspectors' future.
</P>
<P>
   In a show of flexibility, Pickering said he would consider the
Russian proposals. And the White House said Tuesday that Washington
would consider longstanding Russian and French proposals to ease UN
scrutiny of Iraq's nuclear weapons program if it resumes
cooperation with the UN Special Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering also pledged to respond quickly to Iraq's humanitarian
needs.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Washington was willing to expand the so-called
oil-for-food deal, which currently permits Baghdad to sell more
than $10 billion of oil each year to purchase humanitarian goods.
It remained unclear whether expanding the program would make a
difference. Falling oil prices, a battered infrastructure and
bureaucratic snags have prevented Baghdad from meeting its current
ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``United Nations humanitarian workers are returning to Iraq
today,'' Pickering said. ``If they report there are humanitarian
need that are unmet, the Security Council will address the issue on
an urgent basis.''
</P>
<P>
   But Peter Burleigh, the acting US ambassador to the United
Nations, said Washington opposes a Russian request for a council
statement expressing ``regret'' over the US and British military
action in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, the chief UN inspector, appeared emboldened by
Washington's tough line, insisting that a Russian call for his
resignation is a ``red herring.''

TEXAS MEN PLAN TO APPEAL SODOMY CASE AFTER PLEADING NO CONTEST 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE BREWER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Two men challenging Texas' 119-year-old sodomy law
were fined $200 each after pleading no contest to misdemeanor
charges of engaging in homosexual conduct Tuesday and immediately
announced an appeal to the next level.
</P>
<P>
   John Geddes Lawrence, 55, and Tyrone Garner, 31, appeared in
front of Harris County Criminal Court-at-Law Judge Sherman A. Ross
and entered the pleas after he ``respectfully'' denied defense
motions to quash the charges on constitutional grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Ross agreed to continue the $332 appeal bonds they had posted
last month in a justice of the peace court, where they had entered
the same plea so they could appeal to county court.
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday's hearing, their attorneys served notice of appeal
to the Texas Court of Appeals in Houston. If that appeal falls
short, the case will then go to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   If denied there, attorneys say they will take the case to the
U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now high time for Texas to join the majority of states
in this country, which have dumped their homosexual conduct
statutes on the trash heap of unconstitutional laws,'' said Suzanne
Goldberg, a staff attorney for the Lambda Legal Defense and
Education Fund Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg's organization, a national gay rights advocacy group,
is working on the defense of two men with local attorneys Mitchell
Katine and David Jones.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 17, sheriff's deputies entered Lawrence's private
residence and allegedly found the two men engaged in consensual
sex. They were charged with ``deviant homosexual'' conduct, a Class
C misdemeanor punishable by fine of up to $500.
</P>
<P>
   The officers entered the apartment after a third man falsely
reported an intruder on the premises with a gun. That man was later
convicted of making a false report.
</P>
<P>
   Gay activists have tried for years to have the law, which was a
felony until 1974, struck from the books.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the men argue that the law violates privacy rights
and is unconstitutional, discriminatory and ``criminalizes``
homosexual behavior that heterosexuals would not be jailed for.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Supreme Court ruled in 1994 that it did not have
jurisdiction over a civil challenge to the state's sodomy law
because plaintiffs in that action had never been prosecuted under
it. So there's never been a challenge to it in a criminal court
before now.
</P>
<P>
   Katine said appealing the cases will mean that the
constitutionality of the law will be seriously examined for the
first time, something not done at the trial court level.
</P>
<P>
   Both Lawrence and Garner said at a news conference after
Tuesday's hearing that their case was important.
</P>
<P>
   Garner said it's an old law that needs to be changed and that he
and Lawrence did nothing wrong and did not deserve to be arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence echoed those sentiments and said: ``I believe in the
Constitution of the United States and I believe in equal rights for
all citizens. Would you like someone busting into your house? It's
as simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the challenge, local Republican leaders have
defended the law and said the local case might have been staged
solely for the purpose of attacking the law.
</P>
<P>
   But Katine scoffed at that and said: ``We've said over and over
again that this was not staged. Anyone looking at the facts can
clearly see this was not a staged event. It was real, and it was
terrible for these men. It (the late-night arrests) were not a
pleasant experience to go through.''
</P>
<P>
   The law is rarely enforced. Only a handful of such sodomy cases
have been prosecuted in Harris County in the last three decades,
prosecutors have said, and those have mostly been linked to sexual
conduct in public jails. Similar cases have traditionally been
linked to public performance of sex acts.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County, which includes most of Houston, has 3.1 million
people and is the largest county in Texas. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Eighteen states have similar laws, but only Texas, Arkansas,
Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma have anti-sodomy laws that apply only
to homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the Georgia Supreme Court struck down that state's
sodomy law, saying it was a violation of privacy rights. Goldberg
and Katine have said that decision bodes well for their attempt to
challenge the Texas law.

JUDGE THROWS OUT CHALLENGE TO DEMOULAS JUDGMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL LANGNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Putting a stake through the heart of a case that many
said would not die, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court
effectively ended an acrimonious, eight-year legal battle by
throwing out the last major challenge to the billion-dollar
judgment for one branch of the Demoulas supermarket family against
the other branch.
</P>
<P>
   Two rulings issued Tuesday terminate the major portion of the
case, while ordering the judge in it to oversee limited, final
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which has been going on since April 1990, has
pitted the heirs of the two founding brothers of the Demoulas
supermarket empire against each other in fratricidal bitterness
over the division of a fortune estimated at $1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves the heirs of the late George Demoulas who sued
George's brother Telemachus and his four children, charging they
defrauded George's widow and children of their share in the fortune
that consists of the Demoulas supermarket chain, real estate
trusts, and other entities.
</P>
<P>
   A jury awarded George Demoulas' heirs more than $800 million,
and in later jury-waived proceedings Judge Maria I. Lopez awarded
another $206 million. The case also went before federal juries
twice when the Telemachus Demoulas faction accused George's son
Arthur S. Demoulas of wiretapping. Both juries acquitted Arthur S.
Demoulas.
</P>
<P>
   In their latest attempt at overturning the awards by jury and
judge, the attorneys for the Telemachus Demoulas branch had tried
to get the presiding state judge to step down.
</P>
<P>
   But in one of two unanimous rulings Tuesday the justices curtly
dismissed charges that Judge Lopez should have recused herself
because she allegedly had had improper contact with Robert C.
Gerrard, the lead attorney for George Demoulas's heirs.
</P>
<P>
   However, the case is not completely closed. The ruling that
upholds Lopez in her refusal to step down also orders her to hold
further hearings on whether Demoulas Supermarkets is entitled to
get some money from the winning party to pay outstanding taxes and,
if so, how the payment shall be made.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a second ruling, which runs over 56 pages, deals with
the complicated question of how the four children of Telemachus
Demoulas came by their 400 shares of the fortune.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is whether Telemachus's children obtained the shares
as ``bonafide purchasers,'' or whether they knew that their father
gave them the shares from assets George Demoulas's heirs should
have shared in.
</P>
<P>
   The court ordered Lopez to hold evidentiary hearings on the
question and it dissolved a trust that the SJC established to hold
those 400 shares while the matter was pending.
</P>
<P>
   However, Justice John M. Greaney, writing for the unanimous
court, suggested the SJC's view on the matter when he said that
``it appears that the defendant children could have a difficult
task in proving their claim.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerrard Tuesday said that his clients ``are absolutely
delighted'' about the SJC ruling, and added that the attack on
Lopez's impartiality was ``wholly without merit, a grasping at
straws.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerrard said that the heirs of George Demoulas are now entitled
to about $800 million in stock and $250 million in cash that the
losing side must pay within 28 days.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the Telemachus Demoulas faction could not be
reached for comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   They had charged that witnesses had seen Gerrard frequenting a
restaurant owned by Stephen Mindich, Lopez's husband, and that some
witnesses had seen Gerrard and Lopez have drinks together and
engage in long conversations in that restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gerrard and Lopez denied improper contacts and said the
colloquy amounted to nothing more than a brief exchange of
greetings.
</P>
<P>
   Richard K. Donahue, the lead attorney for the Telemachus
Demoulas faction, formally complained about the alleged improper
contact shortly after the SJC upheld the jury award in March 1977.
</P>
<P>
   He said then that he was filing his complaint because the SJC
did not know of it when it upheld the jury verdict and, he implied,
they might have ruled in his clients' favor had they known.
</P>
<P>
   The case took a bizarre turn when Lopez's former law clerk Paul
M. Walsh told the FBI that he had been offered a
``once-in-a-lifetime job,'' and that during discussions about the
job with Donahue and another attorney for the defendants, Gary C.
Crossen, he was quizzed about Lopez. One question they asked him,
according to published reports, was whether he or Lopez had written
the opinion that awarded one of the Demoulas enterprises, Market
Basket, to the descendants of George Demoulas.

CELLUCCI PICKS TOUGH COP FOR PUBLIC SAFETY POST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: N.Y.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ At first glance, Jane Perlov, appointed Tuesday to
become the next secretary of public safety, seems an unlikely cop.
</P>
<P>
   She's just over 5 feet tall, soft spoken, and grew up on New
York's Upper West Side in what has been described as a sprawling
apartment ``filled with oil paintings, Oriental rugs, bookcases,
and overstuffed armchairs that make reading Victorian novels in one
sitting easy.''
</P>
<P>
   But look closer.
</P>
<P>
   In that same apartment, where her parents still live and where
she married a fellow New York City police officer in 1996, there
hangs a picture of her maternal grandmother in 1916 wearing a
three-piece men's suit in a gangster pose.
</P>
<P>
   Perlov, whose first real job was organizing swank fund-raisers
for the Metropolitan Opera in the required uniform of a cocktail
dress, made her mother cry when _ on a dare _ she took the civil
service test, passed, and was on her way to becoming a beat officer
in Harlem, circa 1981.
</P>
<P>
   However, Beacon Hill observers watched Governor Paul Cellucci's
announcement Tuesday with great interest for other reasons, as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Perlov, 42, is a Democrat who believes in the death penalty and
is against ticket quotas. She beat out two political insiders
angling for Massachusetts' top law enforcement post. Furthermore,
she was hand-picked by Lieutenant Governor-elect Jane Swift after
the two met at a conference at Harvard last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of making this a political appointment he (Cellucci)
went with a cop who knows how to clean up the streets,'' said Kevin
Sowyrda, a Republican political consultant. ``It also shows the
influence of Jane Swift on this administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Swift, the youngest woman ever elected to the Massachusetts
Senate, Perlov is accustomed to breaking ground in her career.
</P>
<P>
   After walking the streets of Harlem, getting her nose broken by
a woman on angel dust, and kicking in a drug den's metal door after
being egged-on by her fellow male officers, she eventually became
the commanding officer in August 1995 of that 30th precinct in the
midst of a corruption scandal that marked the station as the
``Dirty 30.''
</P>
<P>
   By the summer of 1997, Perlov had seen crime drop 26 percent in
Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   As commanding officer, she personally joined cops on raids, and,
in an effort to boost morale, once led the precinct officers in a
memorable Macarena dance during a Night Out Against Crime.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being the first cop in her family, she was the first
woman to command that Harlem precinct. Before that, she was the
first woman to command the 20th Precinct on the Upper West Side.
And last year, she became the first woman to command an entire
borough of investigators _ as chief of (500) detectives in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jane Swift told me about Chief Perlov. We interviewed her. I
was very impressed with her record in New York City and we believe
we've made the best choice for this department,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   She beat out Senator James P. Jajuga, a Methuen Democrat and
former state police officer, who supported Cellucci for governor;
and Norfolk District Attorney Jeffrey A. Locke, a Republican
loyalist who was voted out of his job in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff Locke is someone that I hope will come to work for our
administration,'' Cellucci said. ``Senator Jim Jaguga is someone we
offered a major position to _ not this one, but a major position.
He has indicated he would like to continue to serve in the state
Senate, where he has been a very key ally of mine . . . But in the
end we made a decision that we thought was in the best interest of
public safety and the people of this state.''
</P>
<P>
   Perlov said Tuesday she took a pay cut from her $100,000-a-year
position and accepted the job overseeing police, fire, and
corrections in Massachusetts because it is ``a challenge of a
lifetime.'' She also has family here _ a sister and brother-in-law
who live in Norwell. Her husband, Detective Sergeant Robert Maas,
will remain in New York for now, and they will commute to see each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Perlov will succeed Kathleen O'Toole, who left the position in
May and now heads the Boston College Alumni Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being in the job I am in now, obviously I'm one who dares to
be different, I guess, and likes to challenge myself,'' Perlov
said. ``I'm coming someplace where I don't know exactly what it is
I'm walking into . . . I can improve more than I had a chance to as
a police officer. I can take it a step further.''

   Two rulings issued Tuesday terminate the major portion of the
case, while ordering the judge in it to oversee limited, final
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which has been going on since April 1990, has
pitted the heirs of the two founding brothers of the Demoulas
supermarket empire against each other in fratricidal bitterness
over the division of a fortune estimated at $1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves the heirs of the late George Demoulas who sued
George's brother Telemachus and his four children, charging they
defrauded George's widow and children of their share in the fortune
that consists of the Demoulas supermarket chain, real estate
trusts, and other entities.
</P>
<P>
   A jury awarded George Demoulas' heirs more than $800 million,
and in later jury-waived proceedings Judge Maria I. Lopez awarded
another $206 million. The case also went before federal juries
twice when the Telemachus Demoulas faction accused George's son
Arthur S. Demoulas of wiretapping. Both juries acquitted Arthur S.
Demoulas.
</P>
<P>
   In their latest attempt at overturning the awards by jury and
judge, the attorneys for the Telemachus Demoulas branch had tried
to get the presiding state judge to step down.
</P>
<P>
   But in one of two unanimous rulings Tuesday the justices curtly
dismissed charges that Judge Lopez should have recused herself
because she allegedly had had improper contact with Robert C.
Gerrard, the lead attorney for George Demoulas's heirs.
</P>
<P>
   However, the case is not completely closed. The ruling that
upholds Lopez in her refusal to step down also orders her to hold
further hearings on whether Demoulas Supermarkets is entitled to
get some money from the winning party to pay outstanding taxes and,
if so, how the payment shall be made.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a second ruling, which runs over 56 pages, deals with
the complicated question of how the four children of Telemachus
Demoulas came by their 400 shares of the fortune.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is whether Telemachus's children obtained the shares
as ``bonafide purchasers,'' or whether they knew that their father
gave them the shares from assets George Demoulas's heirs should
have shared in.
</P>
<P>
   The court ordered Lopez to hold evidentiary hearings on the
question and it dissolved a trust that the SJC established to hold
those 400 shares while the matter was pending.
</P>
<P>
   However, Justice John M. Greaney, writing for the unanimous
court, suggested the SJC's view on the matter when he said that
``it appears that the defendant children could have a difficult
task in proving their claim.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerrard Tuesday said that his clients ``are absolutely
delighted'' about the SJC ruling, and added that the attack on
Lopez's impartiality was ``wholly without merit, a grasping at
straws.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerrard said that the heirs of George Demoulas are now entitled
to about $800 million in stock and $250 million in cash that the
losing side must pay within 28 days.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the Telemachus Demoulas faction could not be
reached for comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   They had charged that witnesses had seen Gerrard frequenting a
restaurant owned by Stephen Mindich, Lopez's husband, and that some
witnesses had seen Gerrard and Lopez have drinks together and
engage in long conversations in that restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gerrard and Lopez denied improper contacts and said the
colloquy amounted to nothing more than a brief exchange of
greetings.
</P>
<P>
   Richard K. Donahue, the lead attorney for the Telemachus
Demoulas faction, formally complained about the alleged improper
contact shortly after the SJC upheld the jury award in March 1977.
</P>
<P>
   He said then that he was filing his complaint because the SJC
did not know of it when it upheld the jury verdict and, he implied,
they might have ruled in his clients' favor had they known.
</P>
<P>
   The case took a bizarre turn when Lopez's former law clerk Paul
M. Walsh told the FBI that he had been offered a
``once-in-a-lifetime job,'' and that during discussions about the
job with Donahue and another attorney for the defendants, Gary C.
Crossen, he was quizzed about Lopez. One question they asked him,
according to published reports, was whether he or Lopez had written
the opinion that awarded one of the Demoulas enterprises, Market
Basket, to the descendants of George Demoulas.

BOSTON'S DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION HOPES RISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The tumult of impeachment and a recent stumble by Los
Angeles have cast doubts on that city's presumed lock on hosting
the 2000 Democratic National Convention, fueling hopes for Boston's
bid.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the mayors of finalist cities Boston and Denver
trekked to Washington to tout their cities' treasures one more time
for Vice President Al Gore, who apparently is taking a commanding
role in the site decision.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles' star has dimmed due to issues that arose during an
early December visit by a DNC panel, including its relative lack of
organization and vague financial commitments, several political
insiders said.
</P>
<P>
   The same DNC panel brought horror stories of Los Angeles
smugness to Boston, while praising Boston's consummate organization
and its pile of $32 million in financial commitments from the city,
state, and business community, say people familiar with the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's impeachment also has renewed image concerns
involving Los Angeles, hometown of Monica S. Lewinsky and the
Buddhist Temple where Gore accepted controversial campaign
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never believed it was a done deal for LA, not so much
for the money but for the symbolism,'' said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a
political scientist at Claremont Graduate University in Claremont,
Calif. ``Can you imagine the media field trips to Brentwood and the
Buddhist temple?''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Boston is a Democratic Party stronghold without
Hollywood baggage.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's bid has been knocked by those who say Massachusetts is
too liberal at a time when Clinton and Gore have been trying to
move the Democratic Party more to the center. But as the Lewinsky
scandal has dragged on, Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino has
repeatedly shrugged off such criticisms, asking: ``Where else can
they go?''
</P>
<P>
   ``National politics may be playing right into the region's
hands,'' said Lou DiNatale, a political science professor from the
University of Massachusetts at Boston. ``The importance of Boston
and New England to the Clinton administration can't be
underestimated.''
</P>
<P>
   The DNC is not scheduled to choose the convention site until
February.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, the DNC maintains that Los Angeles, Boston, and Denver
are all still in the race. ``This is just one point in the process.
There's a lot of talk about who's up, who's down,'' said Melissa
Ratcliff, DNC communications director.
</P>
<P>
   But privately, city officials and political insiders marvel at
how much more appealing Boston's deep pockets for political
fund-raising and the state's ironclad support for the Democratic
Party appear in the impeachment milieu.
</P>
<P>
   And DiNatale points out that the six Republican senators from
New England are ``essential'' to any deal that can be struck to
avert Clinton's impeachment over the next 90 days. Senator Edward
M. Kennedy, a key Clinton defender, could help persuade his
Republican colleagues on the impeachment issue, said DiNatale.
</P>
<P>
   After months of dissing Los Angeles' freeway jams, gang
violence, and anti-immigrant legislation, Boston officials have
retreated and are now pinching themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could actually get this. Wouldn't that be shocking?'' asked
Menino press secretary Jacquelyn Goddard.
</P>
<P>
   The longstanding policy of the DNC to declare a moratorium on
fund-raising in the host city for 12 months, including the months
before and after the convention, also breaks in Boston's favor,
observers said. Since President Clinton has had to tap Hollywood
luminaries for support for his legal defense fund, they said, he
may need to return to that well in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes down to money, Boston is ahead with a $32 million
bid that includes $8 million from the city (compared to $6 million
in city funds in Denver) and another $8 million from the state.
Neither Colorado or California has come close to the pledge by
Governor Paul Cellucci and the legislative leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles has assured the DNC that Hollywood moguls will come
up with any amount of cash needed, without being more specific.
</P>
<P>
   And since the DNC's convention plans are already three months
behind, Boston's readiness to sign a contract, with guarantees of
police and other services, may be a point in the city's favor. Los
Angeles' Republican mayor may be a strike against that city's bid.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Los Angeles representatives cling to sunny forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We remain extremely optimistic,'' said Andy Spahn, a
DreamWorks movie studio executive. ``The city is going to make
assurances, whatever is necessary, to cement the bid.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston's convention point man, Howard Leibowitz, is more
cautious: ``If one takes seriously the LA problems, we were among
the next in line.''
</P>

FEDERAL RESERVE HOLDS INTEREST RATES STEADY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Reserve voted Tuesday to hold interest
rates steady, judging that three previous rate reductions this fall
had given the economy a big enough kick to keep it growing at a
healthy pace into the new year.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank's decision to shift monetary policy into
neutral is the latest sign that the sense of crisis felt by
economic policy-makers in the United States and around the world
over the summer is easing.
</P>
<P>
   Although analysts still expect the American economy to slow
substantially in 1999, perhaps enough to require further rate cuts
next year, the nation's long expansion no longer appears to be in
any immediate danger.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the impeachment of President Clinton nor the military
attack on Iraq dented the confidence of either investors on Wall
Street or shoppers in the malls. Growth in the current quarter
appears robust. Fears of a credit squeeze in the bond market have
abated. And while manufacturers and farmers continue to suffer from
exports lost, as a result of the global financial turmoil of the
last year and a half, the latest trade figures suggested that the
worst may be past, even for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they reviewed all the factors _ the domestic economy,
credit availability and the foreign situation _ it is noteworthy
that the Fed concluded this time that those factors did not look as
worrisome as they had looked,'' said Maury Harris, an economist at
PaineWebber. ``It's significant that in such a short period of time
the world improved enough that they didn't feel the need to ease
any further.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's decision leaves the federal funds target rate on
overnight loans among banks at 4.75 percent and the discount rate
on loans from the Fed system to banks at 4.5 percent. The decision
to stand pat, after reducing the federal funds rate by
three-quarters of a percentage point in three autumn rate cuts, had
been widely anticipated by economists and investors, and it
provoked little reaction on Wall Street. As usual, the Fed provided
no details of its deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 55.61 points to close at
9,044.46. Bond prices and the dollar fell.
</P>
<P>
   Looking into 1999, the situation abroad remains unsettled at
best, creating considerable uncertainty as to the outlook for the
American economy and for monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   Japan in particular has proved unable to reverse its long
economic decline. Russia's debt crisis is intensifying. Emerging
markets from Thailand to Brazil are still vulnerable to a return of
the financial seizures that wounded their economies over the last
year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, economists said, the Fed will be watching closely
for any renewed threats to stability at home and abroad, and could
well begin cutting rates again in the first half of 1999. With
inflation dormant and oil prices low, the Fed will have
considerable leeway to cut rates to keep economic growth from
falling below the level most economists think it can sustain over
the long run, roughly 2.5 percent. This year the economy is likely
to grow at nearly 4 percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The feeling of an uncontrolled spiral in international capital
markets as well as in economies in Asia and Latin America has
abated a good bit,'' said Stuart Hoffman, an economist at PNC Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hoffman said, there is a good chance that the Fed could
cut rates again by spring. The policy-making Federal Open Market
Committee is scheduled to meet next on Feb. 2 and Feb. 3, and then
on March 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy will be slowing,'' Hoffman said. ``The consumer
inflation rate will remain low and be accompanied by continued
declines in basic commodity prices. And there will still be some
mildly unsettled conditions in financial markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed cut rates three times by a quarter of a percentage point
between Sept. 29 and Nov. 17, citing the potential impact on the
United States of the financial problems that had battered economies
from Thailand to Brazil. After its last rate cut, though, the Fed
had signaled that it would probably take a time out, saying it
expected financial conditions ``to be consistent with fostering
sustained economic expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then most indicators have pointed toward faster economic
growth than was anticipated a few months ago, when the financial
markets were in turmoil and economists were beginning to predict
the demise of a business expansion that is now almost eight years
old.
</P>
<P>
   The strong stock market and solid wage gains have bolstered
consumer confidence and spending, more than offsetting the weakness
in manufacturing. Despite a wave of corporate layoff announcements,
job growth has remained strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Combined with the surprising narrowing in the trade deficit, a
full accounting of the data thus far for the current quarter
suggests that GDP is moving up in the range of 3 percent to 4
percent,'' economists at Salomon Smith Barney said in a recent
report.
</P>
<P>
   But problems abroad _ including signs of economic weakness in
Europe _ are likely to leave Fed policy-makers wary, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against this backdrop, the U.S. economy remains much more
vulnerable than the latest consumer and external trade data
imply,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Given the economy's remarkable resilience and its recent history
of defying predictions of an imminent slowdown, a few forecasters
are even predicting that the Fed might have to raise rates during
1999 to pinch off growing inflationary pressures. But that view
remains very much in the minority.

TOO LITTLE SPENT TRAINING SKILLED LABOR, GROUP DECLARES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Despite an increased demand for skilled labor, only a
fraction of a $700 million training fund is spent in Massachusetts
on preparing workers for high-skilled jobs, according to a report
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were reported by the Massachusetts Business
Roundtable a year after a commission formed by the business
community and the state AFl-CIO asked a Northeastern University
economist to assess current training efforts and trends in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Economist Paul Harrington said Tuesday although the
Massachusetts Jobs Council was created to help boost the state's
skilled labor pool, training and development actually account for
less than 25 percent of its $700 million annual budget. Moreover,
almost half of the total budget is being spent on programs that
have little or nothing to do with developing a skilled work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``By just examining the top 10 programs funded by the
Massachusetts Jobs Council budget, a strong argument could be made
to exclude half of them,'' said Harrington, an associate director
of the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern. He found
that the five programs, which provide everything from vocational
training and student loans for college students to sheltered
workshops for the developmentally disabled, account for $300
million of the training and work force development program's total
budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``These programs may have merit, but they will not help
Massachusetts solve its labor supply problems,'' said Harrington.
The five programs, he added, should be funded by the state
education system, not by a work force training program whose
primary goal is to prepare low-wage, unemployed, and underemployed
workers for high-skilled jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lumping together a diverse range of programs designed to serve
youngsters, adults, the (developmentally disabled), and the
physically challenged does little to help guide public
decision-making on work force development issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other concern is that there is no funding available for
the general incumbent worker training programs that are so
essential to the development of a more skilled work force in
Massachusetts,'' Harrington continued.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the report, State Representative Stephen LeDuc, a
Marlborough Democrat who sits on the roundtable, has filed a bill
requiring that a survey be conducted each year to determine job
vacancies and unemployment across the state. A second survey would
be conducted annually to assess joblessness and training in
disadvantaged communities. Data from the surveys would determine
how and where job training funds should be spent, LeDuc said.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the report, the roundtable said it would recommend the
state's training program be revamped to include a skills training
program. Under that program, companies would pay 50 percent of the
cost to upgrade employees' training and the state would pay the
rest. Additionally, community colleges would work directly with
local companies to develop programs to suit employers' future
needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to identify specific areas where job training is
needed, and then follow up to see how the training is going,'' said
Alan Macdonald, executive director of the roundtable. ``Training
would be across all lines of industry, which should create momentum
and serve as a model in years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   How best to decrease the wage gap, boost the economy, and
prepare workers for the skilled jobs of the future has long been
hotly debated by employers, unions, and economists.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, at a meeting attended by more than 100 employers
and academics, economist Andrew Sum, director of the Center for
Labor Market Studies, reported that although New England
outperformed the nation in the 1980s, future economic growth was
not assured.
</P>
<P>
   He found that even though unemployment had fallen dramatically,
much of the reduction was due to the loss of thousands of workers
who had simply fled the region, possibly in search of better job
opportunities elsewhere.

EDUCATED IRAQIS TRY TO COMPREHEND THEIR LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With IRAQ-FRANCE, IRAQ-OPPOSITION) 
(rl) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ In his spare time, Dhia al-Quasi still likes to
recall the night in 1986 when an audience of actors, directors and
theater professors from around the world greeted his production of
``King Lear'' with a rapturous standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, Quasi doesn't have much spare time. He
rises early for his first class at the Academy of Fine Arts here,
teaches until midafternoon, grabs a quick lunch and then begins his
work as a taxi driver. Without his taxi income, he said, he could
not support his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we had fulfilling lives, but now we have dropped out of
the world,'' he mused after his last class today. ``Everything has
changed, and we really don't understand why. All we can do is
accept it. There is no alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Until 1990, when President Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait
turned this country into an international pariah, Iraqis were known
as some of the most sophisticated people in the Middle East.
Students from across the Arab world flocked to universities here,
and cultural figures like Quasi attracted large and enthusiastic
followings.
</P>
<P>
   But eight years of crushing economic sanctions have turned that
Iraq into a distant memory. Thousands of educated Iraqis have fled
in search of normality abroad. The most resilient remain, but like
King Lear himself, they cannot quite comprehend how they lost so
much that was so good.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and British governments have a simple explanation. They
say that Saddam has built a terrifying arsenal of chemical and
biological weapons, and that foreign powers have no choice but to
limit him in any way possible, even if it means imposing sanctions
and dropping bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Because the political climate here does not permit dissent, it
is hard to gauge what Iraqis really think. But in conversations
after last week's bombing campaign, several sophisticated
professionals said they blame the United States for destroying
their way of life and shredding the prospects of an entire
generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am educated, I know what's happening, and still I blame the
United States and Clinton,'' said Yania Attala, a retired
schoolteacher with a degree in literature. ``If they want to
penalize someone, let them do it, but not the Iraqi people. Doesn't
Israel have a nuclear bomb? Doesn't India? Every country needs
weapons to defend itself. We could be attacked by Iran at any
moment. Why single us out and bomb us?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to live very well,'' Ms. Attala continued. ``I
traveled, I bought whatever I wanted and was quite prosperous. Now
I am reduced to a kind of poverty. Last week I spent four days at
home not knowing if I was going to be hit by a bomb. We gave my
mother Valium to calm her down, but they didn't help. So how do you
think I feel? How would you feel?''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. aid programs have eased the most acute suffering here, but
levels of health, nutrition and education are still nowhere near
what they were a decade ago. After the bombing and Iraq's
subsequent announcement that it will no longer permit monitoring of
its weapons program, a solution seems further off than ever.
</P>
<P>
   In a small office above a busy Baghdad street, Dr. Ahmed
Mahbobu, a pediatrician educated in Glasgow, treats more people in
a day than he used to in a week, he said. Most are unable to pay
and cannot afford to fill the prescriptions he writes. He cannot
even treat his own advancing case of Parkinson's disease because
the medicine he needs is not available here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most common problem I see is underweight and malnourished
fetuses,'' he said as he tried to control the palsy in his right
arm. ``Mothers don't get enough to eat, so their children are
permanently damaged and will not develop normally, either
physically or psychologically. Our rate of children born
underweight used to be under .01 percent. Now it's over 10
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of his reputation, Mahbobu counts some of Baghdad's
wealthiest mothers-to-be among his patients. Without the fees they
pay, he could not survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know how they get their money, but they
certainly seem to get it,'' he said. ``They're in some sort of
business, I guess. Of course people resent it, but that is what
life has become here.''
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq, as in Serbia and other places where economic sanctions
have been imposed, opportunities open up for wheeler-dealers.
Sanctions have turned this country into a sea of poverty, but
sanctions-busting has created verdant islands of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Most Iraqis who live the life of the mind are swimming in the
dark sea as the islands recede ever farther into the distance. They
seek refuge in their intellects and emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could afford good paints again, but other than that,
I don't think about the embargo,'' said Hamid al-Mahal, one of
Iraq's most prominent artists, who studied in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``My painting has nothing to do with politics, and neither do
I,'' Mahal said. ``Of course I want the embargo to end soon, even
today if that is possible. But I keep telling myself that even an
embargo cannot stifle art and creativity. I have to believe that,
or else everything is lost.''

JUDGE THROWS OUT CHALLENGE TO DEMOULAS JUDGMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL LANGNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Putting a stake through the heart of a case that many
said would not die, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court
effectively ended an acrimonious, eight-year legal battle by
throwing out the last major challenge to the billion-dollar
judgment for one branch of the Demoulas supermarket family against
the other branch.
</P>
<P>
   Two rulings issued Tuesday terminate the major portion of the
case, while ordering the judge in it to oversee limited, final
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which has been going on since April 1990, has
pitted the heirs of the two founding brothers of the Demoulas
supermarket empire against each other in fratricidal bitterness
over the division of a fortune estimated at $1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves the heirs of the late George Demoulas who sued
George's brother Telemachus and his four children, charging they
defrauded George's widow and children of their share in the fortune
that consists of the Demoulas supermarket chain, real estate
trusts, and other entities.
</P>
<P>
   A jury awarded George Demoulas' heirs more than $800 million,
and in later jury-waived proceedings Judge Maria I. Lopez awarded
another $206 million. The case also went before federal juries
twice when the Telemachus Demoulas faction accused George's son
Arthur S. Demoulas of wiretapping. Both juries acquitted Arthur S.
Demoulas.
</P>
<P>
   In their latest attempt at overturning the awards by jury and
judge, the attorneys for the Telemachus Demoulas branch had tried
to get the presiding state judge to step down.
</P>
<P>
   But in one of two unanimous rulings Tuesday the justices curtly
dismissed charges that Judge Lopez should have recused herself
because she allegedly had had improper contact with Robert C.
Gerrard, the lead attorney for George Demoulas's heirs.
</P>
<P>
   However, the case is not completely closed. The ruling that
upholds Lopez in her refusal to step down also orders her to hold
further hearings on whether Demoulas Supermarkets is entitled to
get some money from the winning party to pay outstanding taxes and,
if so, how the payment shall be made.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a second ruling, which runs over 56 pages, deals with
the complicated question of how the four children of Telemachus
Demoulas came by their 400 shares of the fortune.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is whether Telemachus's children obtained the shares
as ``bonafide purchasers,'' or whether they knew that their father
gave them the shares from assets George Demoulas's heirs should
have shared in.
</P>
<P>
   The court ordered Lopez to hold evidentiary hearings on the
question and it dissolved a trust that the SJC established to hold
those 400 shares while the matter was pending.
</P>
<P>
   However, Justice John M. Greaney, writing for the unanimous
court, suggested the SJC's view on the matter when he said that
``it appears that the defendant children could have a difficult
task in proving their claim.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerrard Tuesday said that his clients ``are absolutely
delighted'' about the SJC ruling, and added that the attack on
Lopez's impartiality was ``wholly without merit, a grasping at
straws.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerrard said that the heirs of George Demoulas are now entitled
to about $800 million in stock and $250 million in cash that the
losing side must pay within 28 days.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the Telemachus Demoulas faction could not be
reached for comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   They had charged that witnesses had seen Gerrard frequenting a
restaurant owned by Stephen Mindich, Lopez's husband, and that some
witnesses had seen Gerrard and Lopez have drinks together and
engage in long conversations in that restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gerrard and Lopez denied improper contacts and said the
colloquy amounted to nothing more than a brief exchange of
greetings.
</P>
<P>
   Richard K. Donahue, the lead attorney for the Telemachus
Demoulas faction, formally complained about the alleged improper
contact shortly after the SJC upheld the jury award in March 1977.
</P>
<P>
   He said then that he was filing his complaint because the SJC
did not know of it when it upheld the jury verdict and, he implied,
they might have ruled in his clients' favor had they known.
</P>
<P>
   The case took a bizarre turn when Lopez's former law clerk Paul
M. Walsh told the FBI that he had been offered a
``once-in-a-lifetime job,'' and that during discussions about the
job with Donahue and another attorney for the defendants, Gary C.
Crossen, he was quizzed about Lopez. One question they asked him,
according to published reports, was whether he or Lopez had written
the opinion that awarded one of the Demoulas enterprises, Market
Basket, to the descendants of George Demoulas.

<P>
   At the Container Store, a Dallas-based chain that specializes in
storage products and closet organizers, employees do far more than
ring up sales. They are trained to think of themselves as
counselors or problem-solvers _ whether the issue is a shared
closet that must house one spouse's 34 pairs of shoes or a child's
room spilling over with an unmanageable number of toys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had customers come up to us and say, `This is better
than a visit to my shrink,''' said Garrett Boone, the chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has 19 stores around the country, considers
customer service a ``core competency,'' not a frill, and trains
sales clerks for 185 hours the first year; the industry average is
below 10. And the company often hires its best customers,
maintaining that people who are not actively looking for a job turn
out to be great employees.
</P>
<P>
   But the Container Store's approach, alas, is a rare exception.
For most of America, customer service frequently remains an
oxymoron, though there are signs that some stores are paying more
attention to the problem. Staffs have been cut in the heat of
competitive battle, and sales clerks who remain are often less than
stellar _ since with joblessness down, good workers have
higher-paying options.
</P>
<P>
   And while this is a year-round problem, it is especially acute
in the frenzied holiday season. At this time of year, hordes of
shoppers confront temporary sales clerks, who may be the least well
trained of all.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from shoppers' stories, many encounters with sales
``help'' turn decidedly sour. When customers do have a good
experience, it must seem like a rarity, for they often feel
compelled to remark on it.
</P>
<P>
   As gauged by a University of Michigan index, customer-service
satisfaction has dropped steadily the last few years. The rate of
satisfaction among the 200,000 shoppers interviewed remains far
below what it was in 1994, said Claes Fornell, a professor of
business administration who oversees the American Customer
Satisfaction Index. ``You have fewer people serving more
customers,'' he said, adding that he has had his own run-ins with
airlines and cable companies, ``and the result is usually worse
service.''
</P>
<P>
   Some stores that have had cutbacks have little to offer workers
in terms of training or pay. Others have apparently failed to
anticipate what customers might need.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at one store that had good service, to the point that
the guy kind of hovered around me,'' said Inna Hagen, an actress
and lawyer in New York City, ``but then they didn't have gift wrap,
which was annoying when you're shopping for Christmas presents.
They charged me $6 for a ribbon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect good service,'' she added, ``but I think you don't
get it a lot of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Container Store, ``We know we are just wild-eyed fanatics
when it comes to human resources and training,'' said Kip Tindell,
the chief operating officer, who founded the company with Boone 20
years ago. ``It is the most difficult and the most joyous part of
the retail business, and most people avoid it like the plague.''
The company says it makes a hefty profit, too, though it is
privately held and does not make such information public.
</P>
<P>
   Service Intelligence, an Atlanta consulting firm that is hired
to place spies _ or ``mystery shoppers,'' as they prefer to call
them _ in stores to see how well managed everything is, has a Web
site (www.serviceintelligence.com) stocked with horror stories sent
in by consumers. Some of the most outrageous incidents occurred in
retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``While visiting a department store, I was amazed at how the
only sales clerk in the area was chatting on the telephone,'' a
consumer reported. (Neither shoppers nor stores are named on the
Web site.) ``I roamed around the department near the counter trying
to catch her attention. This didn't work. Finally, I approached the
counter and stood directly in front of her. She refused to make eye
contact and actually turned away from me. At this point, I stormed
out of the store, vowing never to return.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the deterioration is the result of price wars, which
prompted one executive after another to zero in on customer service
as an expendable luxury. ``It's been a huge mistake for many of
these retailers,'' said Leonard L. Berry, a professor at Texas A&AMP;M
University's Center for Retailing Studies, who is about to publish
a book, ``Discovering the Soul of Service,'' which examines
businesses that have effective customer service.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   `They cut costs in order to cut prices, in order to compete with
the Wal-Marts of the world,'' he said. ``But they're not competing
with the Wal-Marts anyway, and they'd be better off serving their
particular customers. Price is price, but value is the total
experience, and the best companies compete on the total experience
shoppers have.''
</P>
<P>
   Many customers said they would often be satisfied with a little
basic information, such as having a sales clerk tell them fairly
quickly how soon they are likely to be waited on.
</P>
<P>
   Some stores manage to maintain their islands of civility. At
Saks Fifth Avenue, sales clerks have been known to write thank-you
notes to shoppers after they make purchases _ even if the purchases
are less than spectacular. Nordstrom maintains a sterling
reputation for going out of its way to satisfy customers.
</P>
<P>
   But those are the exceptions. In many cases, the nation's low
unemployment rate has propelled would-be retail workers into
higher-paying jobs elsewhere, leaving few options for stores that
are hiring. ``The big story this year is the employment crunch,''
said Bruce Van Kleeck, vice president of the National Retail
Federation. ``It's been challenging for three years, but this year
is by far the worst, because this terrific economic situation the
United States has been enjoying has been a double-edged sword for
retailers.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not make shoppers any more sympathetic to sales
clerks. ``The great majority of them are either totally incompetent
or they need complete attitude adjustment because they think they
are better than the customer,'' said Anne Goldrach of New York
City, whose experiences made shopping on the Internet that much
more attractive this year.
</P>
<P>
   Joy Johnson, a Brooklyn College student, has seen the issue from
both sides this month. As a part-time cashier at a Sears store in
New York City, she received four hours of training, which she says
she considered enough for that job. But as a shopper, she has not
always been treated kindly. After buying a set of glasses for her
mother at Macy's and discovering that one was broken, she brought
them back. ``He gave me a hard time,'' she said of the sales clerk,
who eventually agreed to exchange them. ``He said maybe I had
broken it. But I had had it only two days.'' Even so, Johnson rates
her shopping experience this year ``so far, so good.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Macy's, part of Federated Stores, said the
clerk was probably trying to determine whether Johnson wanted a
refund or an exchange. ``We certainly do not train our associates
to tell our customers that they are not being trustworthy,'' said
the spokeswoman, Ronnie Taffet, adding that the main store at
Herald Square has been getting ``some very positive results'' in
its year-old effort to improve customer service.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Gurney, a vice president of Service Intelligence's
research center in Seattle, blames the tight labor market for some
problems but says training is essential, no matter who is brought
aboard. And he thinks companies are starting to realize the need
for better customer service.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a ground swell for bringing it back,'' he said, ``but
a controversy about what people should be doing. Companies can
absolutely differentiate themselves with it. But you can also spend
millions without getting any return.''
</P>
<P>
   Fornell points out that replacing human workers with technology
has helped manufacturing and promoted growth. ``But if you take the
same idea and apply it to the service sector, which is so dependent
on human interaction, it is much more difficult to do,'' he said.
``It's not impossible. It is a question of education and of making
technology better.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the products seems to be one of the biggest challenges.
Kurt Barnard, who publishes Barnard's Retail Trend Report, based in
Upper Montclair, N.J., cited an encounter he witnessed in a
suburban mall between a sales clerk and a shopper. ``The lady
wanted to buy one watch, a digital watch, which was $70 or $80,''
he said. ``The salesperson did not know how to set that watch. And
the salesperson did not know the difference between that watch and
another watch that was less expensive, that the customer also
liked.Third, the salesperson didn't know how to light the dial on
the watch. The customer got a little frustrated and said, `Can
anyone help me here?' The sales clerk said, `Let me call my
supervisor,' and then disappeared, never to return. Generally
speaking, this is not unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   But companies that have decided to make sure employees
understand what they are selling say it is a worthwhile investment.
At Peet's Coffee, a chain based in Berkeley, Calif., employees are
taught the subtle differences between various types of coffee and
tea so they can explain them to customers. ``We teach them so that
they can discuss this intelligently,'' said Gerald Baldwin, the
company's founder. ``And our store volumes are much higher than
anyone else's. We like to think it's the way we treat the
customers.''

<P>
   CLEARWATER, Fla. _ ``So, you want to know about my love life?''
said Sophie Silverman, 85 years old and twice a widow, climbing out
of the pool and settling into a lounge chair at her retirement
community, On Top Of The World. She pushed her oversized purple
sunglasses halfway down her nose. ``It stinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that she isn't trying. Mrs. Silverman is out there, as they
say in the singles world. Here is her latest personal ad in the
monthly Senior Voice: ``JWWF (Jewish white widowed female), honest,
attractive, ISO (in search of) happy, healthy and physically fit
soul mate, 65-75 to give me back my life. I like going out dancing,
dining, travel, and would like a pleasant, romantic man for LTR
(long-term relationship).'' Mrs. Silverman is an optimist as well
as a romantic.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of men respond to her ads. They call, she puts on her
best smile and meets them for coffee at the Burger King on U.S. 19
and Sunset Point Road, a prime first-date spot, and she never hears
from them again. It seems that they, too, want someone younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want me, I'm old and gray,'' said Mrs. Silverman,
who happens to be a bottle blonde who works out at the gym and
looks a trim 75.
</P>
<P>
   Where do bald men with arthritic knees get off acting like this?
It's a universal lament among single women that all the good men
are taken. At On Top of the World, the women add, ``Or dead.''
After age 65, according to the census, there are three single women
for every single man.
</P>
<P>
   The dating game never stops. Indeed, for couples who move to
retirement communities, it resumes after decades on the sidelines
after one spouse dies _ just when the survivor is looking his or
her age. The need for companionship, tenderness, love and, yes,
sex, remains as important as ever, but the rules of the game have
changed. Not only women, but men, too, are racing the clock.
</P>
<P>
   At On Top Of The World and other Florida retirement communities
in Clearwater, St. Petersburg and Tampa, it is clear that as always
in matters of love and sex, there is a tremendous range in opinions
and desire. But men generally want younger women more than ever,
and can get them because of the sharp disparity in their numbers.
Plenty of women, like Mrs. Silverman, want younger men, but only
rarely do they succeed.
</P>
<P>
   At Bringing People Together, a Florida dating service that
specializes in senior citizens, a woman who answered the phone said
that while they helped men into their 90s, they tried not to take
women over 78.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while men who got the cold shoulder from the girls back in
high school may fare better in their 70s and 80s, that lasts only
until they lose their driver's license _ no one takes the bus on
dates down here _ or lose their health. No one is eager to be stuck
with someone who has to be nursed six months down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is vulnerable. How does someone go on a date after
being married to the same man or woman for half a century? Kathy
Beck, who founded Senior Connection, a South Florida newspaper that
publishes personal ads, says her office is barraged with questions
by nervous clients: What should they say? How should they act? When
do they sleep together?

   Kenneth Bruwelheide, 79, made his way to the Senior Connection
office in Brandon, near Tampa, five years ago, shortly after the
death of his wife, Betty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very awkward,'' recalled Bruwelheide, a retired plumber.
``I broke down and cried right in front of them. I felt like I was
cheating on my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruwelheide placed an ad modestly describing himself as a
widowed male, in his mid-70s, in search of a companion who likes
bingo and short trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got 57 answers,'' he said. ``There's a lot more widows than
widowers. I think it's a shame. The men died too young, the women
sit there sorry, hurting, nobody to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   One letter he answered was from May McCulloch, a widow four
years his junior. A year and a half ago, Mrs. McCulloch moved in
with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call her Dear,'' Bruwelheide said. ``I have somebody to talk
to, somebody to say, `What are we going to have for supper?' I cook
half the time, she cooks half the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it love?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little slow on that,'' he said. ``When I say `love,' I'm
thinking of Betty.''
</P>
<P>
   Every Wednesday afternoon in St. Petersburg, hundreds of men and
women, many in their 70s and 80s, gather at the tea dance at the
Coliseum, which bills itself as the finest climate-controlled
ballroom in the South. As couples fox-trotted to the music of an
orchestra. Charlene Speaker, in a long flowered skirt, lacy blouse
and pearl earrings, waited to be asked to dance. Her husband died
five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want a marriage, just a companion,'' said Mrs.
Speaker, who allows only that she is past 65. ``Someone who's
loyal.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't seem like a lot to ask, especially for Mrs. Speaker,
a vivacious, striking brunette who can whirl gracefully around the
dance floor for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Speaker has been dating someone, but she is well aware that
she does not have her pick of men the way she did in her youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The men want younger women,'' she said, ``but what are they
going to do with them?''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, short, solicitous, smooth-stepping Neil Oliviero has
come into his own at 82. Oliviero, the former owner of a dress
factory, is one of the most popular men on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trouble is, I won't commit,'' Oliviero, who is divorced,
said with genuine sadness.
</P>
<P>
   He is still trying to work through his last serious
relationship, with a woman named Dorothy, who died nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I love Dorothy?'' he mused aloud. ``What is love?''
</P>
<P>
   The Coliseum is a long way from Evander Childs High School and
the Bronx, where Oliviero failed miserably with the opposite sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``To date a little runt like me, they'd be embarrassed,'' he
said, taking a break after the tango. ``My social success is a
vengeance against everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The Singles Club at On Top Of The World is a poor place to meet
men: Its 200 members are overwhelmingly women. But some women, of
course, do beat the odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I moved to Top of the World six years ago, I said to my
friend Irene, `What about men?''' said Sally Pearl, 63, a retired
junior high school teacher from Long Island who is divorced. ``She
said, `Don't even think about it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yet both Mrs. Pearl and her friend, Irene Hartwell, 83, found
companions.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Pearl was talking about men and dating over fruit and
chicken salads at a restaurant the other afternoon with Joyce Wohl,
a past president of the On Top Of The World singles club, and three
other women.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wohl, a retired social worker who declined to give her age,
said she had been on one date since her husband died nearly seven
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yech, it was a bummer,'' she said. ``The movie was
interesting. He was a drip.''
</P>
<P>
   Florence, a widow who revealed her age (77) but asked to be
identified by only her first name (she thought her family might
deem it inappropriate for her to be discussing such matters),
recalled the humiliation of her dinner with an 83-year-old man who
told her ``all about how he wanted to date this younger woman.''
</P>
<P>
   What would be her idea of the perfect man at this point in her
life?
</P>
<P>
   Florence said she had taken care of her husband for 14 years
before he died. She had loved him, but it is not something she
wants to go through again. She smiled slyly, then said, ``I would
like a note from his doctor stating that he's healthy _ or if he
isn't, that he only has six months to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Her companions whooped with laughter. They could have been any
group of women anywhere, indulging in a favorite pastime: trashing
men. They giggled over the single men at On Top Of The World: ``All
they want is a nurse with a purse.'' But behind the brave and
brittle wisecracks, they were serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to fall in love again,'' Nancy Nazar volunteered.
</P>
<P>
   Florence nodded, and said. ``So would I.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not that they necessarily want to remarry. Indeed, after
years of taking care of husbands and children, the widows of On Top
Of The World and other retirement communities make it clear that
they relish their independence.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them mention marriage and cooking in the same breath,
and say they would not want to cook for a man again. They have
plenty to do without cooking, they say. They stay in shape with
brisk walks in the morning, they go out to lunch, they take trips,
they join clubs, they volunteer, they keep up with their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent my whole life taking care of people,'' said Joanne
Golder, 62, who moved to On Top Of The World with her husband,
Mort, and was widowed nearly two years ago. ``This is my time to do
what I want for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Tucker, a 76-year-old widower, has been dating a widow
four years younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even my mother and my daughter say she's too old for me,''
Tucker said over breakfast at the Family Restaurant on Sunset Point
Road, around the corner from On Top Of The World.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like a woman 55 to 68,'' said Tucker, a retired
mechanical engineer who excels at ballroom dancing. ``It will make
me feel good. I feel they'll be more lively.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he realize that in this market he is a hot commodity? ``Oh,
absolutely,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he has his own insecurities. He, too, feels compelled to lie
about his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can get away with 65 to 68,'' he said. If he owned up to 76,
he said, ``I feel I'd be rejected.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Beller was at the pool at On Top of the World, talking
about his continuing argument with his friend Sophie Silverman _
and they are just friends, both say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't make her understand the difference between love and
companionship,'' Beller said. ``In my opinion, companionship is
more important than love.''
</P>
<P>
   Beller is 80; his wife of 46 years, Florence, died 15 months
ago. She had Alzheimer's disease, and for six years he took care of
her. Now, he wears her wedding ring on his pinky finger, and tells
strangers how much he loved her.
</P>
<P>
   But meanwhile Beller, who still works as a consultant in
industrial physics and has a condo full of books by Vladimir
Nabokov and Thomas Mann, says he enjoys the company of women,
taking them to dinner and classical music concerts and yes, to bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister, who's 72, says to me, `Get some condoms,''' he
said. ``I said, `OK,' but I haven't yet.''
</P>
<P>
   What about AIDS? ``I'm 80 years old. What's going to happen to
me? Am I going to die at 140?''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Silverman said later: ``Jack gets all the women. He can
drive at night.''

 &HT;    TVA contracted to make tritium
 &HT;    By John Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Energy has selected two atomic power
plants in Tennessee to provide essential materials for nuclear
bombs, a move that critics say violates a decades-old U.S. policy
of not mixing atoms for peace with atoms for war.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing his long awaited decision Tuesday, Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson said the nation's bomb-making agency will
contract with the Tennessee Valley Authority to manufacture tritium
at its Watts Bar commercial reactors near Spring City, Tenn., while
using the Sequoyah station near Chattanooga as a backup.
</P>
<P>
   In his action, Richardson skipped over two more expensive
alternatives that have considerable political support as public
works projects in Alabama and South Carolina. He also turned down a
plan to upgrade the government's bomb-making plant in Hanford,
Wash.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, hope was high that Richardson would choose to
build a $4.5 billion linear accelerator at the Savannah River Site
to avoid the concerns over the use of civilian reactors for
weapons. Richardson announced that SRS, where tritium was last
produced for the nation's warheads in 1988, will get a $500 million
plant to disassemble the plutonium cores of nuclear bombs.
</P>
<P>
   While TVA has won the tritium contract, the decision was a a
blow to managers of the federal utility who hoped Richardson would
have opted to assist TVA in the $2 billion completion of its
moth-balled Bellefonte Plant near Hollywood, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would have provided 800 jobs in the area and helped TVA
salvage a critical asset from its beleaguered nuclear power program
that has plunged the agency into some $23 billion in debt. In
return, the Energy Department would have shared in the revenue from
the sell of power from the plant to reimburse it for the program.
</P>
<P>
   Expressing disappointment for his home state, U.S. Sen. Jeff
Sessions (R-Ala.) said, ``There was a window of opportunity where
we could have solved a critical national defense need while
providing a catalyst to bring the Bellefonte nuclear power plant
on-line.''
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the choice of Watts Bar, where tritium production
already is being tested, Richardson declared, ``It is the only
option that doesn't require a large capital expenditure.''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-nuclear groups had lobbied against the project, contending
that using a commercial reactor would fuel the arms race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bad decision at the wrong time,'' said Arjun
Makhijani, director of the Institute for Energy and Environmental
Research. ``This is the wrong message to send the Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   Activists apparently now have an ally in U.S. Sen. Strom
Thurmond, outgoing chairman of the Armed Services Committee, whose
state was passed over in the tritium decision.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared public statement, the South Carolina Republican
declared, ``I have expressed grave concern that such an approach
would only encourage other nations to convert their civilian
nuclear facilities into weapons production sites, and I will
continue to raise these concerns with the administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Makhijani also argued that the government should have waited
until it completes a test at Watts Bar to determine the feasibility
and safety of using a commercial reactor. The Energy Department and
TVA last year began a test to examine the technology for making
tritium at Watts Bar. The test is not scheduled for completion
until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson argued that TVA is a government agency whose charter
includes preserving national security.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us the maximum arms control flexibility. It allows us
to produce tritium when we need it,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   Final costs and a production start-up date have not been set.
The plan to use Watts Bar, which employs about 755 people, still
must be reviewed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
</P>
<P>
   An August report by the Congressional Budget Office estimated
using an existing reactor such as Watts Bar would cost $1.1 billion
over 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter signed Tuesday to Richardson, TVA Chairman Craven
Crowell reluctantly agreed to the decision. ``TVA remains willing
to support the national defense in the coming years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The H in H-bombs, tritium is an isotope of hyrdogen which
greatly enhances the destructive force in nuclear weapons. It would
be produced in the reactors while they are also being used the
generate electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other bomb ingredients_plutonium and uranium_trititum
decays fairly rapidly. Government experts predict the nation's
nuclear arsenal will soon need to be replenished with tritium.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton had ordered that the Energy Department produce
tritium by 2005, and Congress had mandated that Richardson report a
decision by the end of this year.

JUDGE QUESTIONS TEXAS CLEMENCY PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA TOLLEY  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas' clemency process was questioned Tuesday
as attorneys for two death-row inmates insisted that the state's
pardons and parole process unjustly denies mercy in virtually every
capital case brought before it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In cases of innocence, it's is a fail-safe. In others, it's a
grant of mercy,'' Rita Radostitz, one of the lawyers challenging
the process, said when a federal judge asked her to define
clemency.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in Texas, it's neither,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Stanley Faulder, a Canadian citizen, and Danny Lee
Barber have asked U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks to order Texas to
hold public hearings on clemency requests in capital murder cases
and to list the criteria an inmate must meet to get a death
sentence commuted to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks, who earlier this month halted the two inmates' scheduled
executions, did not issue a ruling Tuesday. But he did express
concern about the way the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles
handles clemency cases for condemned inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find the state so silly in insisting on this secret
process,'' Sparks said.
</P>
<P>
   A death-row inmate's request for clemency is reviewed by the 18
board members, who vote by fax or phone and don't publicly explain
their decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush can only grant clemency to a death-row
inmate if he gets a recommendation to do so from the board. Twelve
board members testified that the information they receive by mail
is enough to make a decision and none has seen the need to hold a
public hearing on a request or talk about it by phone, even though
by law they are allowed to if they feel it's necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is incredible to me that in 70-plus cases ... that no
person has ever seen an application for clemency important enough
to hold a hearing,'' Sparks said. ``I find that testimony very
troubling, but that's not my job.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge's job is to decide if the state clemency system meets
the U.S. Constitution's requirement of due process of law.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, who asked many of the questions during the two-day
hearing, wanted to know how attorneys for the state could defend a
system that does not allow a citizen to ask board members why they
voted a certain way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must be some reason for clemency. What is it?'' he
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Dewey Helmcamp, a lawyer with the Texas Attorney General's
office, acknowledged that the process ``probably is not perfect,''
but he insisted it does pass constitutional muster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did these two men get due process?'' Helmcamp asked. ``We
respectfully suggest, absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulder, 61, was convicted of killing an East Texas woman in
1975. His case has generated controversy in Canada, where there is
no death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Barber, 43, was sentenced to die for the beating death of a
woman more than 19 years ago in Balch Springs, a Dallas suburb.

FIVE HOUSE REPUBLICANS URGE SENATE TO CENSURE CLINTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Five House Republicans who voted to impeach
President Clinton have broken ranks with their colleagues and
called on the Senate to censure him rather than remove him from
office.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., four
congressmen _ Reps. Sherwood Boehlert and Benjamin Gilman of New
York, Mike Castle of Delaware and Jim Greenwood of Pennsylvania _
urged that censure be considered along with other options short of
conviction on impeachment charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We urge you to allow the Senate to consider strong censure as
a remedy,'' they wrote, adding that it would be wrong for senators
to interpret their votes last week ``to mean that we view removal
from office as the only reasonable conclusion of this case.''
</P>
<P>
   A fifth Republican lawmaker, Rep. Bob Franks of New Jersey,
called for censure Tuesday. But Franks stressed that the president
would have to admit lying under oath for a censure resolution to be
an acceptable way out of the constitutional crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The five legislators were among a small group of moderate
Republicans who joined with Democrats before the historic votes on
impeachment last Saturday to urge the House GOP leadership to allow
a vote on censuring the president as an alternative to impeachment.
That request was denied, and the House ended up approving two
articles of impeachment against Clinton charging him with perjury
and obstruction of justice in the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not backpedaling on my vote,'' Castle said Tuesday in an
interview with Cable News Network. ``I was for censure originally,
(but) when we got to our actual vote we had no choice. We had to
vote for impeachment or we had to vote to let the president go
altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House said the call for censure from the Republicans
``adds important voices to the call for a bipartisan solution to
this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it does ... put an asterisk on the actions taken by
the House in the sense that it underscores the wrong decision that
the House leadership made in not offering their members a choice,''
said Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls continued to indicate strong support for
the president Tuesday, with job approval ratings of more than 70
percent in most surveys. But a poll by the Pew Research Center for
the People &AMP; the Press found that only one-third of Americans have
been following the impeachment proceedings with any interest.
</P>
<P>
   According to the the Pew poll, impeachment didn't even make it
as a top story this year for most Americans, who seemed more
interested in the weather, the bombing of Iraq last week and the
Jonesboro, Ark., school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the poll found that 67 percent of those who have been
following the impeachment process believe that Republicans voted to
impeach Clinton for purely political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't like it. They see it as an exercise in
partisanship,'' said Pew Research Center Director Andrew Kohut.
</P>
<P>
   The favorable polls are one reason the White House is continuing
its push for censure or some other compromise to avert a full-blown
trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lockhart denied that the president and his team of
aides and lawyers are trying to directly influence the Senate, he
said the Republican calls for censure represent ``a growing sense
that we should find some quick bipartisan solution to this
situation that falls short of a long, protracted trial.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Lockhart said, Clinton's legal team will
prepare to defend him in the event there is a trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that there's a compelling and persuasive case to be
made, and they are preparing to make that case if the Senate moves
forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has been busy trying to engage the help of
former Senate Majority Leaders Bob Dole, a Republican, and Democrat
George Mitchell to explore what it would take to reach a negotiated
settlement. Former ambassador to Russia Robert Strauss, a Texan who
has served both Democratic and Republican presidents, has also been
sought out, as has former White House counsel Lloyd Cutler.
</P>
<P>
   White House Communications Director Ann Lewis, however, does not
view reaching out to friends and political associates on both sides
of the aisle as an effort by the White House to influence the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about lobbying,'' she told CNN. But she did not
rule out a continued White House effort to advise and comment as
the impeachment process moves forward.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the White House does, some senators believe that there
will have to be at least some semblance of a trial before a
solution other than removal from office can be offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's our duty to hold the trial,'' said Sen. Robert
Bennett, R-Utah, who has said in the past that he would likely
favor censure as an appropriate punishment for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But like his GOP colleagues in the House, he said Clinton will
have to at least acknowledge that he broke the law by lying under
oath to a federal grand jury about his relationship with Lewinsky,
a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a trial, a simple majority of 51 votes would be
needed in order to halt it with no action being taken. Bennett said
that could happen fairly quickly, but only if Clinton indicates
that he would be willing to submit to ``a very public
humiliation,'' such as standing in the well of the House or Senate
to be reprimanded in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is going to be put behind us, it's going to have to be
put behind us in a rather dramatic way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It will take a two-thirds vote by the Senate to convict Clinton
and remove him from office. But Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.,
said there seems to be consensus emerging to censure Clinton rather
than convict him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that is the case, then it seems to me that it's in the best
interest of the Senate to move to that result, sooner rather than
later,'' Dodd said.

 &HT;    Atlantans back fight against infertility
 &HT;    By Diane Lore and John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Giving birth to eight babies might be playing medical
roulette, but some Atlanta parents who have faced infertility said
couples should have the right to try for children _ regardless of
the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   And it's unlikely that insurance companies, politicians or even
doctors will move to regulate reproductive technology because no
one wants the backlash that would likely result from stepping into
American bedrooms, a medical ethicist said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's going to take this on?'' said Arthur Caplan, director of
the Center of Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania.
``Nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's the way it should be, said parents who have had
difficulty conceiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really comes down to an individual decision,'' said Scott
McDonald, 41, of Atlanta, whose wife has undergone fertility
treatments. ``I don't really think there's any middle ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Many, however, voiced reservations about the tremendous burden
of the world's first known surviving set of octuplets, seven of
whom were born Sunday in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heaven help her,'' said Laura Guest, a Roswell(Ga.) mother who
struggled with infertility until she gave birth to twins last year.
``Two wear me slap out.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Dore of Norcross(Ga.) also said the births left her with
mixed feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to judge someone when you haven't been in their
shoes,'' said Dore, who has a biological child and one adopted from
South Korea. ``But it is going to be a tremendous drain on the
parents and on the system.''

   The octuplets' mother, Nkem Chukwa, had been receiving a double
punch of the fertility drug FSH, which stimulates ovulation, and
HCG, or human chorionic gonadatropin, which is normally produced by
a healthy placenta to maintain pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald said such results are why he and his wife decided to
try in vitro fertilization, in which eggs and sperm are fertilized
outside the womb and implanted, so they had more control over the
outcome. With in vitro, doctors decide how many fertilized eggs
should be returned to the mother's uterus. Typically, physicians
pick no more than five in the hopes that one or two will implant
and become babies.
</P>
<P>
   The first time the McDonalds tried, it worked. They have a
2-year-old, Frances Anne.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to mess around with Mother Nature,'' McDonald
said.
</P>
<P>
   But, despite the increasing rate of multiple births, insurance
company officials said it is unlikely that the industry would
attempt to regulate such events. Already, many have backed away
from policies that covered some fertility treatments _ instead
paying only for the lab tests and the medical diagnosis of
infertility.
</P>
<P>
   And although insurers are often stuck with the bill generated by
babies born in multiple sets, who cost hundreds of thousands of
dollars as they mature in neonatal wards, they say it is still not
a hot issue for the industry _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something that the Blues have looked at from a
national perspective,'' said Laura Ryan, spokeswoman for the Blue
Cross/Blue Shield Association in Chicago. ``And, frankly, I doubt
they ever would.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at both Aetna-U.S. Healthcare and Kaiser Permanente
also said they don't see any changes in their policies.
``Obviously, this (birth of eight babies) is not an ideal
outcome,'' said Walter Cherniak, spokesman for Aetna-US
Healthcare's Southeastern division. ``But this is really more of a
medical debate than a coverage issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid, the government health insurance plan for the poor,
also does not see multiple births as a financial risk.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Taylor, chief deputy commissioner of the state's
Department of Medical Assistance, said there's a far larger, more
chronic, problem of single babies still being low-birthweight _ a
key indicator of future health problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any reason to believe that there are a large
number of multiple births draining the system,'' said Taylor, whose
agency oversees Medicaid. ``In our case, the low birthweight
problem (and the expense) is far more common with single births.
That's why one of our main goals is strong prenatal efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   And with all of those concerns in mind, Caplan said unregulated
fertility treatments and advances _ that could result in seven,
eight, or more infants - will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are very loathe to say no to babies,'' he said. ``We
are very resistant to having third parties _ whether it's Congress,
insurance companies or bioethics busybodies _ tell them what they
can't do.''

   When state legislators in North Carolina were debating charter
schools two years ago, some feared a re-emergence of the
white-flight academies that had sprouted in the South a generation
earlier in response to school desegregation. So lawmakers threw in
a clause requiring the schools to ``reasonably reflect'' the
demographics of the school districts they serve.
</P>
<P>
   Today, at least 22 of the state's 60 charter schools appear to
violate the diversity clause, according to estimates, but for
reasons no one had expected. All but one are more than 85 percent
black, populated mostly by children whose parents wanted to flee
failing schools and enroll them in small academies that have
unusual freedom to pick their own curriculums and staffs, bypassing
local bureaucracies.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a debate that reflects the national divisions over
charter schools, the teachers union and some legislators, including
a number of members of the black caucus in the North Carolina
Legislature, are calling for the schools to diversify within a year
or be closed, while Republicans in the Legislature have strongly
backed them as an alternative to the school bureaucracies. The
heated debate places the ideals of parental choice against the
quest for diversity in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a real tightrope for us to walk to be true to
the charter school movement and at the same time not re-segregate
the schools,'' said Mike Fedewa, chairman of the North Carolina
Advisory Commission on Charter Schools.
</P>
<P>
   Around the nation, nearly two-thirds of the states have
permitted charter schools, but the laws governing them vary widely.
Some states give control to local school districts; others, most
recently New York, allow independent agencies to grant charters,
bypassing local districts and in some cases, local union rules. The
New York legislation passed last week and would permit up to 100
charter schools to begin opening in fall of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen of 34 charter schools that opened in the state in 1997
were disproportionately black, compared with their districts,
according to the Office of Charter Schools in North Carolina. The
state Board of Education has not released figures for the current
year, but the nonprofit North Carolina Education Reform Foundation,
which has helped to start charter schools, says at least nine of
the 26 schools that opened this year violate the diversity clause.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina passed legislation permitting charter schools two
years ago, when Republicans controlled the General Assembly. But
the last election brought Democrats to power, and this energized
calls to force schools to comply strictly with the diversity
clause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want my tax dollars to pay for an all-white system or
an all-black system,'' said Rep. Mickey Michaux, a Democrat. ``My
whole belief is the only way you are going to have racial harmony
in this country is for people to know each other, and schools are a
means to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the politically potent state teachers union plans to
push the Legislature to force the State Board of Education to close
schools that remain segregated. ``They knew the laws when they
opened,'' said John Wilson, executive director of the North
Carolina Association of Educators, which is affiliated with the
National Education Association. ``They let the whole issue of
diversity play a minimal role in their values. In North Carolina,
we have worked very hard to try to have integrated schools and they
have used charter schools to undermine what we have done.''
</P>
<P>
   The national association, which represents more than 2 million
teachers and other school personnel, has expressed reservations
about charter schools nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has produced unusual alliances. The Healthy Start
Academy in Durham, a charter school that is 99 percent black, has
joined forces with the North Carolina Foundation for Individual
Rights, a conservative organization that has challenged affirmative
action in the state's public colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Any individual or organization in North Carolina can apply for a
charter. Charter schools, which are now legal in 34 states, receive
state financing based on enrollment and are self-governed, which
makes them free to adopt different curriculums or teaching methods.
Most pick students by lottery.

 &HT;    Message of a Christmas past finally delivered
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Christmas card to Linda and Donald Gooley from
their nephew Brent arrived almost four years late. But in some
ways, it was right on time.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the Gooleys, who live in Colorado Springs, Colo.,
figured the U.S. Postal Service had simply lost the card. But the
reason for the delay was far more complicated, and bizarre, than
that.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Gooley, who lived near Norfolk, Va., was 22 when he died
in November 1994. He had created a Christmas card to raise money
for the hospital where he and his sister had undergone treatments
for cystic fibrosis, the disease that eventually claimed his life.
</P>
<P>
   He put a snowman on the front, family members say, because it
represented his own mortality. The card also included a short poem
he wrote. The last line was: ``The sun came up, he melted away,
only to be built again someday.''
</P>
<P>
   The metaphor _ a snowman who brings joy, then disappears _
became part of Brent's eulogy. His parents mailed copies of the
card to close relatives, including his aunt and uncle out West.
</P>
<P>
   That was in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``They promised to send us a card right after his funeral and we
never got it,'' Brent's Aunt Linda says. ``I was wondering what
happened, and I thought maybe it was lost or they had forgotten to
send it because it was such a painful time. I didn't want to press
them on it.''
</P>
<P>
   That was before the Gooleys heard about Thomas Lamonde, a
40-year-old Fayette County(Ga.) resident. This August, Lamonde was
sentenced to 15 months in federal prison and fined $15,000. His
crime: stealing about 100,000 pieces of mail, bound for cities all
over the country, from a postal transfer point at Hartsfield
International Airport(Atlanta, Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   While working for a Postal Service contract airline from 1994 to
1997, Lamonde systematically stole mail _ mostly brightly colored
greeting card envelopes _ hoping to find cash inside. He hoarded
the stolen mail at a rental storage unit in Riverdale(Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   ``We received a phone call from a merchant who ran the storage
facility, who said one of the tenants hadn't paid his rent. So he
cut off his lock and found all this mail,'' says postal inspector
Glenn Falkner. ``We found a half-million dollars in unnegotiated
checks. You had to see it; the mail was up to your waist. It filled
up a truck.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamonde was apparently using cash from the stolen greeting cards
to play the Georgia Lottery. When he was caught, he confessed,
saying he needed the money to raise his two children, who are
mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   The pilfered mail was held for evidence, then sent to its
intended recipients along with an explanation about Lamonde's scam.
The addressees include a young girl whose grandmother had sent her
a birthday card before she died and a man who was a
manic-depressive whose family was trying to send him letters of
encouragement. He later committed suicide, Faulkner says.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the Gooleys of Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got it on the first Saturday of December,'' Brent's aunt
remembers. ``It kind of made my Christmas. . . . It's a reminder
that he was here, once upon a time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gooleys' children are about the same age Brent would be.
This year they have holiday plans of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife called me at work when the card came to the house and
she was pretty emotional,'' says Donald Gooley. ``The kids aren't
coming around for Christmas, so this is the first year we'll be
alone. My wife wasn't feeling very Christmassy.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Gooley says the card is the perfect way to remember his
nephew. Brent often spent his spare time cheering up younger cystic
fibrosis patients in the same hospital where he was treated while a
child.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just like Brent to come out of nowhere and perk you
right up,'' he says. ``This is probably the neatest gift we've had
all season.''

UNDATED: by lottery.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In North Carolina, many offer smaller classes, with lessons
organized around a theme. Healthy Start Academy, for example, uses
phonics to teach reading. The Explorers Middle School in Raleigh
concentrates largely on new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The schools in North Carolina have attracted widespread interest
among African-Americans, which some politicians and educators say
reflects the dissatisfaction among many blacks with traditional
public schools. More than half of all students attending charter
schools are African-American in a state where blacks make up 30
percent of public school enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were always discipline problems at the other schools,''
said Quinton Holmes, 51, who lives in Winston-Salem, N.C. Holmes is
the legal guardian of his grandson, John, 10, a fourth-grader who
had already been to four different schools before enrolling in the
Carter G. Woodson Charter School last year. ``This is the first
school where he has really been able to learn anything,'' Holmes
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jo Anne Woodard, who is now executive director of the Sallie B.
Howard charter school in Wilson, N.C., had never heard of charter
schools until two years ago. She associated the term school choice
with white Republicans. ``I didn't trust it at all,'' said Woodard,
a Democrat. ``I thought anything that came from Republicans
couldn't lead to anything good for black folks.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the state's charter-school law took effect, Woodard
received a call from Vernon Robinson, a Republican city councilman
in Winston-Salem, who directs the North Carolina Education Reform
Foundation. Robinson, who is black, canvassed the state for
potential sponsors of charter schools and has ushered 20, including
Woodard, through the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not for charter schools, private schools or public
schools, I'm for schools that work,'' said Robinson, who has also
worked to help black churches start private schools.
</P>
<P>
   The State Board of Education has begun a study of state's
charter schools on the diversity issue. ``The state board should
take an aggressive position in saying to the schools they have a
year to develop a proactive recruitment plan and to demonstrate
their schools are open and diverse,'' said Wilson, who accused the
state of ``dragging its feet'' on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the state teachers union is using diversity as a
means to undermine the charter schools, whose teachers have not
flocked to join the association. ``There's no doubt in my mind that
NCAE is using diversity to go after charter schools,'' said Kay
Daly, a spokeswoman for the North Carolina Foundation for
Individual Rights.
</P>
<P>
   But Wilson, the union leader, said the association supported
charter schools that were diverse, citing the Explorers Middle
School. The school, in downtown Raleigh, is conveniently near both
predominantly white and black neighborhoods, and minorities make up
25 percent of its students. The school achieves the balance by
maintaining two lists for its lottery, one for minority students
and another for whites. ``We first pull from our minority list and
then we place the minority students who are not selected into the
general pool,'' said Pam Hartley, executive director of the school.
</P>
<P>
   Charter schools that are in predominantly black neighborhoods
are at a disadvantage in achieving diversity since few white
parents want to send their children to schools in those areas, many
educators say. ``I have been to white churches,'' Woodard said.
``I've been to shopping centers in white neighborhoods and did not
get any applications.''
</P>
<P>
   Healthy Start Academy has a multiracial board, a white principal
and 30 white parents initially signed up for the lottery in initial
stages of the application process last year. But when the school
announced its location in a black neighborhood, all but two white
applicants dropped out of the process.
</P>
<P>
   Roxane Premont, a board member whose daughter is one of two
whites at Healthy Start, said she was committed, despite some
awkward moments. ``I'm not going lie to you and say it does not
test my comfort zone,'' she said. ``But I knew enough about the
school to overcome any comfort level issues that I had.''
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter, she said, gets more attention now than she did at
her previous school. ``She's been to preschool in a predominantly
white, middle-class school,'' Premont said. ``So I know and I have
some basis to make comparisons. I do know as a matter of fact she's
getting a better education and that's the bottom line for me right
now.''

MALLS INTRODUCE SHOPPING INCENTIVES TO BUILD CUSTOMER LOYALTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CUSTOMER-SERVICE-NYT)

 By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Malls around the country, in a growing move to stem shopper
defections to the Internet, catalogs and their competitors down the
highway, are enticing customers this season by giving them
something new: a reward for shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a cue from frequent flier programs, long distance
telephone companies and the like, many shopping malls are now
seeking to build brand loyalty, retain customers and track spending
patterns by offering shoppers extra rewards. These range from
prepaid calling cards, magazine subscriptions, a year's supply of
soft drinks, to health club discounts, Caribbean vacations and new
cars. Even credit card companies such as Visa have cards linked to
shopping malls.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping better track of shoppers and their preferences can give
retailers an edge over a growing number of rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The retail industry is getting extremely competitive,'' said
John Konarski, vice president of research at the International
Council of Shopping Centers, a trade group. ``Malls are trying to
cultivate a relationship where customers will shop at their
centers.''
</P>
<P>
   Profits also can get a kick from higher spending levels of loyal
customers, said Mike Hand, president of apparel services at the NPD
Group, a market research firm based in Port Washington, N.Y..
``It's easy to raise prices with loyal customers.''
</P>
<P>
   At 15 malls operated by the Wellspark Group, customers can show
their receipts and receive a card tallying their shopping points.
The new program offers instant prizes _ gift certificates, store
discount coupons and compact discs. Depending on how much is spent,
shoppers can earn free tickets to sporting events, and weekend
trips.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, customers earn a point for every dollar spent. For
programs linked to credit cards, usually shoppers earn points
totaling about 2 percent of their bill when shopping at a
participating mall; they earn about 1 percent on all other card
purchases. The points are then redeemable in the form of gift
certificates, which can be used in any mall store.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know who our top 10 shoppers are and where they go,'' said
Adrienne Davis-Brody, senior vice president of marketing at
Wellspark.
</P>
<P>
   Kellie Piche, a schoolteacher in North Providence, R.I., has
already redeemed about $12,000 worth of points, exchanging them for
several $40 prepaid Mobil gasoline cards and a weekend hotel stay
in Newport, R.I..
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just nice to get something back,'' said Ms. Piche, 28.
``We had to buy these things anyway,'' she said of the new carpet,
appliances and furniture she and her fiance bought to remodel their
condominium.
</P>
<P>
   While the rewards program did not spur Ms. Piche to shop at the
mall, it will keep her going back, she said, adding that she hasn't
yet redeemed the points she earned for her Christmas shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Various spending levels can qualify shoppers at the Newport
Center mall in Jersey City to receive discounts at the J.C. Penney
optical center or for car rentals, Broadway theater tickets or
Caribbean cruises.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Christmas season is really important,'' said Jim Roberts,
regional marketing director for the Simon Property Group, which
operates the mall. ``That's when a lot of people are looking for
incentives and rewards.''
</P>
<P>
   At other malls around the country, shopping incentives can range
from free parking to special VIP rooms, to entertainment to keep
children amused while parents shop.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1987, the number of malls in the United States has jumped
about 40 percent, to almost 43,000, according to the International
Council of Shopping Centers. New malls average more than 1 million
square feet of space, about 70 percent larger than a decade ago.
With their mix of restaurants, multiplex cinemas, carousels and
virtual-reality arcades, they are being billed as entertainment
centers and tourist attractions. Shoppers are expected to spend
about $1 trillion at malls this year, 53 percent of all non-auto
retail sales.
</P>
<P>
   And the stakes are higher than ever. The retail industry has
been buffeted by unseasonably warm temperatures, stock market
gyrations, and political tensions, which has dampened some
spending. Although many Wall Street analysts still expect about a 4
percent to 5 percent increase in holiday sales this year, at least
one firm has lowered its forecast for department stores.
Discounters will continue to gain this year. But analysts at
Salomon Smith Barney believe department stores will remain under
pressure, and now forecast sales at those chains to increase about
1.5 percent, down from an estimate last week of an increase of 2.4
percent. And some department store executives are already looking
to the after-Christmas sales to buoy lackluster holiday profits.
</P>
<P>
   In the retail industry, Neiman Marcus is generally credited with
introducing the first customer loyalty program in 1984. Customers
who spend at least $3,000 on their Neiman Marcus card are eligible.
Higher spending totals _ much higher _ qualify customers to receive
Hawaiian or European vacations, a lifetime supply of Salvatore
Ferragamo shoes or a new Jaguar sedan.
</P>
<P>
   Mall programs have not reached that level _ yet.

THE LOOK OF EUROPE'S NEW CURRENCY PROVES A STICKY QUESTION
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Will the pope be on the euro?
</P>
<P>
   The question is hardly academic, for while the European Central
Bank's directors gathered in Frankfurt, Germany, on Tuesday to
discuss ranges for interest rates, European Union officials met in
Brussels, Belgium, to figure out how to spread the new single
currency into Europe's nooks and crannies and to distant holdovers
from the days of imperial ambition.
</P>
<P>
   At issue on Tuesday were French-controlled islands _ Mayotte, in
the Indian Ocean, with a French-speaking population upward of
105,000, and St. Pierre and Miquelon, rocky outcroppings off
Newfoundland, population 6,900, mainly fishermen and their
families. Technically, the islands are not part of the European
Union, but the officials proposed that when France adopts the euro
in January, they should be allowed to do likewise.
</P>
<P>
   Trickier was the question discussed on Monday regarding three
tiny independent lands _ Monaco, the principality on the French
Mediterranean that is twice the size of Hoboken, N.J.; San Marino,
a republic in central Italy whose area is half that of Boston, and
the Vatican, the papal domain whose 108.7 acres on the western
outskirts of Rome make it an eighth the size of Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   European officials dealing with the euro have long puzzled about
how to treat these ministates. Under an agreement with the French
central bank, Monaco has long minted francs for use on its
territory. Similarly, San Marino and the Vatican use Italian lire
and mint lire coins, though not notes, including Vatican coins with
the image of the pope. Unlike Monaco's francs, which are not legal
tender in France, the lire of San Marino and the Vatican are good
throughout Italy.
</P>
<P>
   But in 2002, when euro notes and coins are introduced, lire and
francs will disappear, and European officials in Brussels must
decide whether to allow these three states to adopt the euro, even
though they do not belong to the European Union. Moreover, since
the lire of San Marino and the Vatican are now good throughout
Italy, should their euro coinage be allowed to circulate in the
future in all 11 euro countries?
</P>
<P>
   The question got sticky in October when French officials
suggested that Paris looked askance at having coins with the image
of the pope as legal tender in France.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, European Union officials proposed to freeze the
status quo. Thus, Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican would use the
euro, though without the right to issue their own money, which
would have to be done by France and Italy, albeit with distinct
local designs. As now, Monacan francs and San Marino and Vatican
lire would only be accepted in Monaco and Italy, respectively. The
15 European finance ministers are expected to confirm the proposal
at a meeting on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   So will the pope show up on the euro?
</P>
<P>
   Joaquin Navarro Valls, his spokesman, was evasive. Italian
newspapers reported that perhaps the Vatican would have to make do
with neutral themes, like images of St. Peter's Basilica, on future
coins. ``We will have to negotiate all the details of this new
reality,'' Navarro Valls said.

 &HT;    Miami Valley escapes nasty ice, but not the cold
 &HT;    By Brandon Peterson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Car batteries may need an extra jolt today as the
temperature in the Miami Valley is expected to plummet to this
year's record low.
</P>
<P>
   Morning temperatures are expected to be around 5 degrees and may
reach a high of 20 degrees today, according to Accuweather
meteorologist Mark Tobin. The average temperature in the Miami
Valley during winter months - December, January and February - is
29 degrees. While the temperature fell drastically overnight, many
residents were surprised when they didn't see the icy roads that
weather forecasters predicted for Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said the Miami Valley didn't get the ice and the snow
predicted for today because dry air came in behind the cold front
and pushed the precipitation off to the east.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists said the inch of snow that was expected to
blanket the Miami Valley today likely will move south into
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's winter storm warnings spurred motorists to prepare for
the worst. Mark Joefreda, plant manager at Grismer Tire Co. said
the company had three times as many people as usual come in to buy
tires to prepare for hazardous driving conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of preparation for the icy roads, but it (the
ice) didn't come,'' Joefreda said.
</P>
<P>
   Road crews from AAA Miami Valley also were busy on Tuesday,
according to vice president Ray Keyton. Keyton said AAA responded
to more than 1,300 calls between 5 p.m. Monday and 5 p.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tremendous amount of rain and wind we had caused us to
have our busiest day of the year,'' Keyton said.
</P>
<P>
   He said most of the call outs were for frozen car door locks.
Keyton said he expects similar problems today. He advises motorists
not to use hot water to unfreeze car door frames because the sudden
temperature change may shatter the windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have your car parked outside, it's going to be hard to
get into unless you want to use a hair dryer,'' Keyton said.

BANGALORE VENKATA RAMAN, 86, RESPECTED ASTROLOGER IN INDIA, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., New York) (fb) 
By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bangalore Venkata Raman, one of India's most respected
astrologers, died on Sunday, suffering a heart attack as he edited
The Astrological Magazine, the monthly publication he founded 62
years ago. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   In India, where a widespread belief in Vedic astrolology
dictates the timing of both private and public occasions, from
marriages to inaugurations, Raman was widely regarded as an honored
scientist.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote about 200 books on the impact of celestial bodies on
human destiny and world events and crusaded to gain international
respect for traditional Indian beliefs and practices that Western
encyclopedias discuss under the heading of occultism.
</P>
<P>
   In India he was addressed as ``Doctor,'' and at his death
political leaders in his home state of Karnataka and in New Delhi
offered public condolences.
</P>
<P>
   In its obituary, the national newspaper, The Hindu, noted
without any qualification that Raman ``made several outstanding
predictions relating to the Second World War, fates of Hitler,
Mussolini, Hirohito and others, Indian independence, the Chinese
invasion of India, Nehru's death, Indo-Pakistan conflicts, the
Vietnam War, the Declaration of Emergency in India, the
assassination of Indira Gandhi and other events through his column
in The Astrological Magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   The obituary also cited Raman as a researcher in
``astro-psychology, weather and political forecasts and
disease-diagnosis.''
</P>
<P>
   From his home in Bangalore, a city that is one of the centers of
Indian science and computer technology, Raman often challenged the
Western scientific view of astrology as a pseudoscience whose
methodology was distinctly opposed to its own findings and
theories.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Astrology in Forecasting Weather and
Earthquakes,'' he declared, ``There is a need on the part of the
seismologists and meteorologists to shed their prejudices and
embark on the investigation of the ingenious methods used for
thousands of years with such success.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere he lashed out at those who paid no heed to Vedic
astrology, which links astrological lore from Greek and Chaldean
sources to the notions of karma and the aims of life described in
ancient Hindu texts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government's supine ignorance to the tremendous potential
of astronomy is indigestible, especially so since those
forewarnings can save lives and sufferings,'' he wrote, citing the
10 months' advance notice he gave in his column of the earthquake
that struck Iran on Sept. 18, 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Raman traveled widely, addressing conferences and university
meetings. In 1970 he lectured at the United Nations on the
``Relevance of astrology in modern times.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1959 he came to New York to address a congress on astronomy,
leading him to write ``A Hindu in America,'' in which he said he
had no difficulty in surviving on a diet of vegetables, fruit, milk
and cornflakes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 he delivered the keynote address at the first
international symposium on Vedic astrology, in San Rafael, Calif.,
where he was given a lifetime achievement award. In his travels
abroad he would often cite such Western scientists as Max Planck,
George Wald and Bertrand Russell, and their reservations about the
possibilities of science, as proof that Indian disciplines of
thought and faith deserved respect alongside the dominant canons of
science.
</P>
<P>
   He was was born in a village near Bangalore on Aug. 8, 1912.
</P>
<P>
   He studied in Bangalore, specializing in homeopathy. He started
his magazine in 1936, building it into a publication read in India
and 20 other countries. The magazine's Internet site declares that
he received an honorary directorate from the Pythagorean University
in 1947 and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society
in London. It also says that while he did not draw up charts for
money, he was regularly consulted by ``saints, scientists,
political leaders and heads of governments.''
</P>
<P>
   In his writings and publishing, Raman was helped by his wife,
Rajeswari, who is the director of an institute of yoga for women.
He is also survived by his daughter, Gayatri Devi Vasudev.

THREE TENORS' PROMOTER SENTENCED IN GERMANY FOR TAX EVASION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ireland)  (mk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Matthias Hoffmann, the German promoter who turned the Three
Tenors concerts into a worldwide extravaganza, was sentenced
Tuesday to five years and eight months in prison for tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   A court in Mannheim, Germany, found Hoffmann guilty of evading
close to $10 million in taxes and said it was pursuing
investigations against the tenors _ Luciano Pavarotti, Jose
Carreras and Placido Domingo _ for possible complicity in tax
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Pavarotti recently canceled two Berlin concerts, one with the
Berlin Philharmonic on New Year's Eve and another with Deutsche
Oper on Jan. 25, after lawyers advised him that it was unwise to
come to Germany while the investigation continued. When they
informed German organizers of the cancellations earlier this month,
lawyers for Pavarotti said he would make up for his absence as soon
as the case was resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Carreras and Domingo could not be reached Tuesday for comment.
In New York, Pavarotti's manager, Herbert Breslin, said neither he
nor his client had any comment. ``I'm not privy to the problems
Hoffman has with the German tax authorities,'' Breslin said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffmann, who organized the tenors' world tour in 1996, which
included stops in the United States, Europe and Asia, was arrested
in Germany in July 1997 and has since been held in prison. The
court said Tuesday that the 17 months he had already served would
be deducted from his sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman, 47, dropped out of Mannheim University in 1970 to
present a rock festival that became known as the German Woodstock.
He set up his first concert agency in 1971, and initially focused
on rock music, including concerts by the Rolling Stones and Queen.
By the 1980s, he was also working with Carreras and Domingo,
enjoying what he later described as ``incredible international
success.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s he linked up with the Three Tenors, who had
enjoyed a stunning success with their 1994 sellout concert at
Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles. A dozen more concerts were organized
and beamed to television audiences of hundreds of millions. Audio
and video recordings of the concerts became the best-selling
classical recordings ever.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffmann paid the tenors well: Each received $1.5 million a
concert, German prosecutors said. In 1996 Pavarotti commented:
``Good money, eh? By God, it's good money.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contended at the trial that Hoffmann avoided paying
taxes by illegally splitting the payment for each concert into
$500,000 in salary and $1,000,000 in licensing income, and paying
the latter sum into a front company based in Ireland that
prosecutors believe was controlled by the three tenors.
</P>
<P>
   Under German law, Hoffman should have deducted German taxes from
the salary portion _ something he failed to do _ and should have
explained to the tax authorities why such a large portion of the
overall fee to the artists came in the form of licensing income. He
was also accused of avoiding taxes on a number of other concerts
and events with no link to the tenors.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Hoffmann grew out of the imprisonment of a
Munich concert promoter, Marcel Avram, who was also accused of tax
fraud. Lawyers for Hoffmann, who once described his partnership
with the tenors as ``a winning team,'' had pleaded for a sentence
of less than five years, while choosing not to contest several of
the charges.

 &HT;    Message of a Christmas past finally delivered
 &HT;    (ATTENTION, VIRGINIA, COLORADO EDITORS)
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Christmas card to Linda and Donald Gooley from
their nephew Brent arrived almost four years late. But in some
ways, it was right on time.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the Gooleys, who live in Colorado Springs, Colo.,
figured the U.S. Postal Service had simply lost the card. But the
reason for the delay was far more complicated, and bizarre, than
that.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Gooley, who lived near Norfolk, Va., was 22 when he died
in November 1994. He had created a Christmas card to raise money
for the hospital where he and his sister had undergone treatments
for cystic fibrosis, the disease that eventually claimed his life.
</P>
<P>
   He put a snowman on the front, family members say, because it
represented his own mortality. The card also included a short poem
he wrote. The last line was: ``The sun came up, he melted away,
only to be built again someday.''
</P>
<P>
   The metaphor _ a snowman who brings joy, then disappears _
became part of Brent's eulogy. His parents mailed copies of the
card to close relatives, including his aunt and uncle out West.
</P>
<P>
   That was in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``They promised to send us a card right after his funeral and we
never got it,'' Brent's Aunt Linda says. ``I was wondering what
happened, and I thought maybe it was lost or they had forgotten to
send it because it was such a painful time. I didn't want to press
them on it.''
</P>
<P>
   That was before the Gooleys heard about Thomas Lamonde, a
40-year-old Fayette County, Ga. resident. This August, Lamonde was
sentenced to 15 months in federal prison and fined $15,000. His
crime: stealing about 100,000 pieces of mail, bound for cities all
over the country, from a postal transfer point at Atlanta's
Hartsfield International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   While working for a Postal Service contract airline from 1994 to
1997, Lamonde systematically stole mail _ mostly brightly colored
greeting card envelopes _ hoping to find cash inside. He hoarded
the stolen mail at a rental storage unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We received a phone call from a merchant who ran the storage
facility, who said one of the tenants hadn't paid his rent. So he
cut off his lock and found all this mail,'' says postal inspector
Glenn Falkner. ``We found a half-million dollars in unnegotiated
checks. You had to see it; the mail was up to your waist. It filled
up a truck.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamonde was apparently using cash from the stolen greeting cards
to play the Georgia Lottery. When he was caught, he confessed,
saying he needed the money to raise his two children, who are
mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   The pilfered mail was held for evidence, then sent to its
intended recipients along with an explanation about Lamonde's scam.
The addressees include a young girl whose grandmother had sent her
a birthday card before she died and a man who was a
manic-depressive whose family was trying to send him letters of
encouragement. He later committed suicide, Faulkner says.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the Gooleys of Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got it on the first Saturday of December,'' Brent's aunt
remembers. ``It kind of made my Christmas. . . . It's a reminder
that he was here, once upon a time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gooleys' children are about the same age Brent would be.
This year they have holiday plans of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife called me at work when the card came to the house and
she was pretty emotional,'' says Donald Gooley. ``The kids aren't
coming around for Christmas, so this is the first year we'll be
alone. My wife wasn't feeling very Christmassy.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Gooley says the card is the perfect way to remember his
nephew. Brent often spent his spare time cheering up younger cystic
fibrosis patients in the same hospital where he was treated while a
child.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just like Brent to come out of nowhere and perk you
right up,'' he says. ``This is probably the neatest gift we've had
all season.''

FRANCE PROPOSES LETTING IRAQ SELL OIL, WITH NEW MONITORING SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: With IRAQ-OPPOSITION, IRAQ-SCENE) 
(rl) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ In the wake of the British and U.S. bombing of Iraq,
France proposed Tuesday that the United Nations set up a new system
for monitoring Iraq's arms programs and let it export oil, but make
sure none of the revenue is used to buy weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said: ``We
think that seven years of monitoring by the U.N. Special
Commission, plus the strikes that have taken place, have created a
new situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The objective we all have in the Security Council is for Iraq
not to become a danger again, and with everything that has been
inspected and monitored, and all that has been destroyed, we think
we can move from inspecting the past, so to speak, to making the
future safer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that should be done by the Security Council because
its authority and its role have been put at a disadvantage,'' he
said, echoing criticism by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin in
parliament of the way the British and U.S. bombing had bypassed the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States itself speaks of unity being necessary in
the Security Council,'' Vedrine said. ``If we really think the
Security Council is important, we have to make it the key player
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain French ideas for a new system of U.N.
monitoring, first called for by President Jacques Chirac on Sunday
after the bombing ended, Vedrine said:
</P>
<P>
   ``First, we need a system of surveillance of arms, to verify
that Iraq doesn't have more arms than it is allowed and doesn't
embark again on a policy of acquiring weapons of mass destruction.
We don't pretend to have a detailed plan worked out, and we'll have
to talk with all our partners in the Security Council. But there
should be both technical means, cameras, etc., and on-the-spot
inspections, but we think that can't be done by the U.N. Special
Commission in its present form the way it has been done in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether, like Russia, France believed that the
commission's head, Richard Butler, should be replaced, Vedrine did
not answer directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question of personalities has been posed by several
members of the Security Council, particularly by Russia, quite
clearly, but I think you have to consider the question of
personalities as a function of the job that has to be performed,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second,'' he went on, ``our thinking is that if we can agree
on an effective system of continuous monitoring, one that provides
adequate guarantees, we should be able to lift the embargo on Iraqi
oil sales _ I'm not saying lift all the sanctions, there are other
sanctions besides oil, and that's another problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``The oil embargo has already been modified with
the petroleum-for-food program. What happens to revenue from those
sales is quite closely monitored, making sure they are used for the
population and not for buying arms, for example. It shouldn't be
that much more complicated to monitor the revenue from sales if the
oil embargo is lifted. That's a sensitive issue, it's not something
the Iraqis want.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't made detailed proposals, we're simply in the
process of discussion,'' said Vedrine, who has been on the
telephone in the past two days with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have expressed some ideas, but we think it has to be
discussed with our Security Council partners,'' he said. Other
French officials said controls could include monitoring Iraqi ports
of entry to make sure that foreign goods bought with oil revenues
were only those permitted by U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether France disagreed with the U.S. view that
international sanctions would not work as long as President Saddam
Hussein remained in power, Vedrine said even the United States
seemed to have little political leverage inside Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   But he dismissed Iraq's public rejection of the French proposals
as premature. ``It's too early for discussions with Iraq,'' he
said. ``We know what Iraq wants, the lifting of all the sanctions,
without anything in return. Nobody supports that idea, not even the
Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   And he said France did not believe diplomacy would be cut short,
at least not immediately, by renewed American bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two approaches are mutually exclusive,'' he said. ``But
more bombing doesn't seem about to happen now. Why would it? What
would be the objective? What we're dealing with is a political
posture taken by the United States, which always insists that it
has the right to take action if it decides to do so, but it's not
something that seems likely again at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a period of reflection, in all our capitals. Everybody
should develop their own ideas about what to do. I think after
that, we need bilateral consultations among various members of the
Security Council, and later a more formal discussion in the
Security Council.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he concluded, ``Iraq is not a bigger risk today than it was
in 1990, or five years ago. It's impossible to believe that.''

 &HT;    Ohio Mayor defends declaration of 1999 the 'Year of the Bible'
 &HT;    By Charlise Lyles
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Miamisburg Mayor Dick Church said Tuesday he
``never dreamed'' that signing a city proclamation which declares
1999 ``The Year of the Bible'' would ``cause this kind of uproar.''
</P>
<P>
   But his action became front-page news Monday as the American
Civil Liberties Union urged Church to rescind the Dec. 10
proclamation or face legal action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make all kinds of proclamations for things I feel are good
for this community,'' Church said Tuesday. ``I never dreamed it
would cause this kind of uproar. I don't see anything wrong with
it. It doesn't mean everyone has to read the Bible. Everyone has
their choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Church said he received about 50 telephone calls in support of
the proclamation, some from as far as North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But the Miamisburg Bible proclamation marks the third time in
less than two years that Miami Valley public officials or
institutions have been accused of blurring the line between church
and state.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the Brookville School District agreed to explore the
use of an ``educational chaplain'' in the schools. On Dec. 14, the
Brookville school board tabled the plan, saying it would likely be
challenged in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1997, Dayton Mayor Michael R. Turner hosted the Mayor's
Prayer Breakfast, planned by conservative Christian churches.
Members of the Jewish community complained that the Turner excluded
non-Christians. This year, Turner reportedly considered changing
the name of the event to the Dayton Prayer Breakfast. It is not
city funded.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on religion and church-state separation say such
incidents may be caused by lack of awareness on the part of public
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be ignorance or lack of reflection,'' said the Rev.
James Heft, University of Dayton chancellor and professor of faith
and culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an effort to assert a value without really thinking
about the consequences,'' Heft said. ``Anybody in public office who
begins to promote or do something that seems to promote a specific
religion, given the tradition of separation of church and state,
needs to consider that there is bound to be opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul McMasters, First Amendment ombudsman at the Freedom Forum
at Vanderbilt University, agreed that often officials are
well-intentioned but misguided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things like the mayor's proclamation are quite often a very
sincere and good-hearted attempt to recognize the religious
sensibilities of what is the majority group in any community,''
McMasters said. ``I wouldn't call it ignorance. I would say it's
something that's not on their radar screen that anything as
well-meaning could be offensive to some people in the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Church signed the proclamation at the request of local members
of the New-York based American Bible Society and the all-Christian
Miamisburg Ministerial Association. Proclamations do not have to be
approved by the city council.
</P>
<P>
   McMasters said that the wording of the proclamation would
determine whether it actually violates the First Amendment
insistence that the government ``shall make no law respecting an
establishment of religion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If indeed the proclamation seems to advocate the particular
Christian view of the world, it would be tough to see where any
court would uphold his right to do that,'' McMasters said. ``If the
proclamation just declares the year as it would declare 'pickle
day,' then it has got a little more chance of being acceptable as
far as the Constitution is concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   The proclamation states in part that ``renewing our knowledge of
and faith in God through the Holy Scripture, the Bible, can
strengthen us as a nation and as a people.'' It urges Miamisburg
residents to read the New Testament at least five minutes each day.
</P>
<P>
   The Miamisburg proclamation comes at a time when awareness of
religious freedom is heightened as Americans celebrate a
multiplicity of religious faiths with Christmas, Hanukkah and
Ramadan occurring within the same month.
</P>
<P>
   Experts added that in making gestures such as Church's, public
officials sometimes fail to consider the country's growing cultural
and religious diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Tarif Hourani, a Muslim and board of directors member of the
Islamic Society of Greater Dayton, had no qualms with Church's
effort to encourage religious study.
</P>
<P>
   However, said Hourani, ``I would rather see a 'year of the holy
book' where people of different faiths are encouraged to go back to
whatever source they believe in and read from that book. I have no
problem with Christians going back and reading their book. But I
would also like to see a call honoring the Quran for the Muslims.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Awakening a sense of religious values'' is a noble goal, said
Rabbi Shmuel Klatzkin at the Chabad Center of Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   But Klatzkin said while Jews consider the earlier Hebrew
scriptures _ known to Christians as the Old Testament _ to be holy,
the New Testament ``doesn't ring a bell for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be more of a sense of inclusion,'' he said.

COMMENTARY: LARRY AND LUCY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those who just can't wait for Larry Flynt to expose the sex
lives of some more GOP ``big fish'' in the next Hustler, there's a
titillating tidbit in the ``Men of the Year'' issue of Time. In an
interview, Lucianne Goldberg laughingly recalls a tell-all book
proposal from the ancient, pre-Monica past in which a ``very famous
Republican name'' would not take off his glasses ``even when he was
buck naked, performing a particular sex act ... '' Time deletes the
Republican name Ms. Goldberg merrily provided, but surely someone
will pass her dish on to the rest of us soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   In the few days since Bob Livingston's resignation, not even
Yuletide good will can slow the sludge. On the right, CNBC's
``Hardball'' trumpets secret congressional documents ``accusing the
president of actual forcible rape.'' On the left, Salon magazine
uncovers still more sleaze from Dan Burton, the congressman who has
previously admitted to fathering a child out of wedlock. And don't
expect an end once Bill Clinton leaves office. ``After this thing
is over,'' Ms. Goldberg tells Time, ``we'll move on to the next
thing. There's always more to come. Especially now that I know
how.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's a moral distinction between Ms. Goldberg, a fierce
partisan on the racy fringe of the publishing world, and Flynt, a
fierce partisan on the racy fringe of the publishing world, it's
visible only to William Bennett, who actually told Larry King on
Monday that he knew of no conservative counterpart to the
``Democrats and liberals'' prying into private lives. Bennett
apparently hasn't heard either of Ms. Goldberg, who urged Linda
Tripp to tape Monica Lewinsky and then sped the results to
Newsweek, or of Richard Mellon Scaife, who funneled some $2 million
to The American Spectator, which hired private detectives to dig up
dirt on the president. Flynt so far has offered only up to $1
million to smoke out hanky-panky, though he seems to be getting
more bangs for his buck in the capital than Scaife did even in
Clinton's all-too-fertile Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Partisans can and perhaps will argue forever whether the left or
the right has the grosser slime machine. (Lucy or Larry _ now
there's the choice from hell.) But it's certain that the greater
casualties will be on the right, since it's the right that has
ratcheted up sexual misbehavior as a bar to public office. It was
Bennett who in February declared: ``Notice to Republican
candidates: If you committed adultery, I don't think you are going
to get the nomination.'' It was Jerry Falwell who announced after
the revelation of Livingston's affairs (but before his resignation)
that he ``should have withdrawn himself'' when initially offered
the job. It was congressmen like Zach Wamp, Steve Largent and Don
Manzullo _ favorites of the Christian Coalition all _ who warned
Livingston on impeachment eve that his ``indiscretions'' could cost
him right-wing GOP votes essential to elect him speaker in January.
</P>
<P>
   By never promising us Boy Scouts in the Rose Garden or Rotunda,
the Democrats have little to lose in this ugly game. If what we
know about Bill Clinton's sex life by now hasn't leveled him, what
further revelation could? The Republicans, meanwhile, have handed
Larry Flynt the ammunition to mow them down. The only way
disarmament will come is if the GOP now takes that ammunition away
_ if someone within the Republican Party has the guts to stand up
to its powerful religious wing and say that private sexual behavior
(whether that of a heterosexual congressman or a gay ambassadorial
nominee) is really, truly not a criterion for public office.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Livingston could have been just the heroic Joseph Welch
required, but by inaccurately likening his plight to the
president's and then resigning, he botched his historic opportunity
and handed the culture warriors of his party the very victory they
crave. Unlike Clinton, who was supposedly impeached for the illegal
act of perjury, not sex, the fallen speaker-to-be resigned for sex
alone, not perjury _ thereby ratifying the religious right's
position that sex in itself can drum a sinner out of public office.
Far from inspiring the presidential resignation he intended,
Livingston has in one disastrous act empowered both his own party's
zealots and Flynt. Our ``Crucible'' may have only just begun.

COLOMBIA, REBELS PREPARE FOR FIRST PEACE TALKS IN NEARLY SEVEN
YEARS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN OTIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA MACHACA, Colombia _ Like a barnstorming politician in a
winning campaign, Jorge Briceno stopped his silver pickup on a
dusty country road to embrace fellow guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The burly Briceno, who wore camouflage fatigues and a black
beret, had reason to swagger. As the top military strategist of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, Briceno has
directed a series of devastating attacks over the past six months
that have left the Colombian army reeling.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a key figure as the government and the FARC prepare
for their first peace talks in nearly seven years. Some analysts
contend that the FARC is undergoing a power struggle between
veteran rebels who favor negotiations and more militant commanders,
like Briceno, who still dream of Marxist revolution.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, observers say, the Colombian government is
wracked by divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-liners want to overhaul the poorly trained 120,000-man army
and press their war against the FARC, while President Andres
Pastrana, who was elected in June, has staked his reputation on
reaching a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, there are growing concerns that the talks, which
are scheduled to begin Jan. 7 with a meeting between Pastrana and
FARC commander Manuel ``Sureshot'' Marulanda, could bog down and
that the 34-year-old conflict will rage on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that both sides are more interested in consolidating a
strategy for war than a strategy for peace,'' said Alfredo Molano,
a sociologist and guerrilla expert.
</P>
<P>
   But in southern Caqueta state where the peace talks will be
held, people are more optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FARC has repeatedly stressed their desire for peace,''
said Omar Garcia, the mayor of San Vicente del Caguan, a farming
town 170 miles south of Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   Local residents are getting an up-close look at the guerrillas.
Police and army troops have left the area because Pastrana agreed
to demilitarize a 16,216-square-mile swath of territory for 90 days
starting Nov. 7 in order to lure the rebels to the bargaining
table. That allows the guerrillas to move about freely.
</P>
<P>
   At a roadblock in the hamlet of La Machaca, two young insurgents
stopped every car, truck and motorcycle to question the drivers.
Although he is wanted by the state for terrorism, Briceno
confidently drove through the region as he led a convoy of pickups
filled with rifle-toting rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The elusive Briceno, who is better known in Colombia by his nom
de guerre ``Mono Joyjoy,'' greeted two foreign reporters but
refused to make any comments about the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite initial fears that the area would descend into anarchy
once the demilitarized zone went into affect, the crime rate has
gone down, Garcia said. Security is provided by the guerrillas and
by an unarmed civilian police force.
</P>
<P>
   In San Vicente del Caguan, there used to be one or two murders a
week. But none have been reported since the neutral zone was
established.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone commits a crime, the guerrillas will go after
them,'' said Oscar Tellez, a lay church worker. ``At night, people
go out to dance, to dine, or to play soccer. Before, after 8:30 or
9, there was no one on the streets except for a few drunks.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the military withdrawal, appliance salesman Carlos
Rincon feared that the rebels would scare away clients. Instead, he
said, sales have increased.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels call the demilitarized zone a ``peace laboratory''
and analysts say they are on their best behavior in an effort to
impress the nation and the world as more attention is focused on
the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrilla commanders hold frequent meetings with local
politicians, business people and students to discuss their 10-point
platform, which includes agrarian reform, a top-to-bottom
restructuring of the army and police, and economic demands, such as
dedicating half of the federal budget to health and education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FARC is not going to negotiate for just simple things,''
Molano said. ``They want to reform the entire political system.
From these points, they are not budging.''
</P>
<P>
   A former government official involved in the peace process said
that even though the guerrillas have the upper hand in the war,
they have several reasons to strike a deal.
</P>
<P>
   They include international condemnation of the rebel practices
of terrorism and kidnapping and their involvement in the drug
trade.
</P>
<P>
   They also face the threat of U.S. military intervention in
Colombia, an offensive by right-wing paramilitary groups that has
killed hundreds of suspected rebel supporters, and flagging popular
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost 80 percent of the people believe that the guerrillas
are delinquents without any ideals,'' wrote Enrique Santos, a
columnist for the Bogota daily El Tiempo, citing a poll published
last week by his newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels ``realize that an armed revolution would be very
difficult and would come at an extremely high cost,'' added Javier
Munera, director of a Bogota research center. ``Even a bad deal is
better than no deal at all.''
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, Marulanda, the legendary 69-year-old FARC
leader, backs the peace process. But Leonel Narvaez, a Roman
Catholic priest in San Vicente del Caguan, warns that Briceno and
other young FARC commanders are preparing to step up their attacks
if negotiations fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a generational fight,'' Narvaez said of the two guerrilla
factions.
</P>
<P>
   Molano said the guerrillas, who number about 15,000, may move
from their customary hit-and-run attacks on remote jungle villages
to targeting larger Colombian cities. Three weeks ago, Briceno
insinuated that the FARC was about to bomb five towns in central
Colombia, which provoked an exodus of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Narvaez, the priest, claims that the rebels are using the
demilitarized zone to brief FARC commanders from other regions, to
test new methods of terrorism, and to train and recruit fighters.
He added that families in the zone have been asked to provide a son
or a daughter to the rebel cause.
</P>
<P>
   The demilitarized zone, he said, ``will either be a laboratory
for peace or a laboratory for war.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that Pastrana lacks a consensus within his
own government on how to deal with the rebels. Defense Minister
Rodrigo Lloreda, for example, has called the FARC's peace
initiative ``a game and nothing serious.'' The entire process was
almost derailed before it began due to the army's refusal to remove
130 unarmed troops from the military base in San Vicente del Caguan
until earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   With U.S. backing, Lloreda plans to transform the largely
conscript Colombian army into a professional fighting force with
better mobility and intelligence capabilities. The idea is that an
improved battlefield performance would give the government a
stronger bargaining position in future negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   According to Molano, the government has pressed the rebels for a
cease-fire in recent months in order to buy time to reform the army
_ a task that would be much easier under a truce. So far, the
rebels have refused and have been attacking almost constantly.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the views of many Colombian business people, Jorge
Visbal, president of the powerful National Ranchers Federation,
recently told El Tiempo: ``We must search for peace but prepare
ourselves for war.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most fundamental problem is that Colombia's
ruling class seems unwilling to consider the wholesale reforms that
the guerrillas are proposing, according to Francisco Leal, dean of
the faculty of social sciences at the University of the Andes in
Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   ``The establishment isn't even considering ceding economic or
political power,'' Leal said. ``Without crossing this barrier, you
won't have a peace pact.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ACTEAL, Mexico _ For six days, only the dogs and chickens were
left living in Union Progreso, a nearby village at the foot of a
mountain in the southern state of Chiapas. But this week, the
farmers, their wives and their children _ 163 people in all _ came
out of hiding, even though they feel terrified that their neighbors
are going to sneak into town and kill them in their sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not stand living in the forest any more,'' said
Mario, a community leader who refused to give his full name and
covered his face with a blue bandanna. ``We feel that if we are
going to die, it would be better to die in our homes than in the
mud, like animals.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his hostile neighbors, Mario said: ``There have
been many threats. They want to kill us, like what happened in
Acteal.''
</P>
<P>
   One year ago, 45 people, most of them women and children, were
killed as they prayed in a church here. The massacre, the deadliest
single attack in Chiapas since the Zapatista rebellion began in
January 1994, touched off outrage around the world. President
Ernesto Zedillo promised to identify and punish all those
responsible and to step up efforts to bring peace to the
strife-torn region.
</P>
<P>
   Today, some 97 people, including 11 police officers, are being
detained on charges that they took part in the attack. The former
governor, Julio Cesar Ruiz Ferro, resigned over the scandal and
several high-level officials, including the state attorney general
and the state director of public security, have been barred from
holding public office for at least eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as some 2,000 people gathered Tuesday at the graves of
the dead from Acteal to commemorate the first anniversary of the
massacre, there were few expressions of reconciliation and healing.
About 300 residents of the village _ many of them survivors of
those killed _ entered the ceremony waving a banner that read,
``Welcome to Acteal, an Open Wound.''
</P>
<P>
   Zapatista rebels, their faces covered with black ski masks,
chanted ``Death to President Zedillo, Assassin of the 45 Martyrs of
Acteal!''
</P>
<P>
   And another group of Acteal residents put on a re-enactment of
the massacre, complete with men wearing police uniforms, women and
children falling over as if dead and firecrackers set off to
reproduce the sound of gunfire. The re-enactment was interrupted by
a military helicopter that circled overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Such demonstrations, people here said, and the plight of
communities like Union Progreso show that the kind of tragedy that
shattered this nation one year ago could happen still today.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Carlos Morfin Otero, a Jesuit priest who serves Acteal,
said that many in the community were still afraid of attack because
the high-level police officers involved with the massacre remained
free. And the military presence, he said, has been increased around
Acteal, with one soldier for every 12 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is exactly the same as it was a year ago, or
maybe worse,'' Morfin said. ``Despite what the government says,
there is still no security. People have no faith in the police, and
their distrust creates a tense atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Indigenous communities across the Chiapas highlands have been
torn by violence since the uprising, in which some 145 people were
killed. Talks between the government and the rebels remain stalled,
and efforts to obtain a true cease-fire have failed.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights observers said that some 200 people have been
killed in conflicts between pro-government paramilitary groups and
armed Zapatista sympathizers. And, the observers report, more than
15,000 indigenous people have been forced to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis in Union Progreso offers a look at how people get
driven away. The community of farmers, which sits at the of a
mountain so high that clouds crash against its cliffs, supports the
Zapatistas. On the ridge above is the community of Los Platanos,
whose 2,800 residents are largely members of the PRI, the governing
party.
</P>
<P>
   The two villages have been fighting for months over issues like
land, control of a new water system and politics. Men in both
communities have been killed. In June, hundreds of police officers
_ helped by residents from Los Platanos _ raided Union Progreso to
execute several arrest warrants. Five young men _ between the ages
of 16 and 22 from _ Union Progreso were killed in the gunfight that
ensued.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, tensions flared again when a convoy of trucks from
Los Platanos was ambushed by four gunmen wearing masks. An
11-year-old boy was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors spread that the boy's family blamed residents of Union
Progreso and vowed to avenge his killing. Residents of Union
Progreso fled in the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   They spent six days hidden in a forest, about a two-hour walk
from their village. The residents said it rained most nights. Their
children began suffering high fevers and many developed severe
rashes on their faces, feet and ears. They ate mostly dried
tortillas.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday, their suffering became intolerable, they said. And
they decided, by unanimous vote, to return to their homes. Carrying
babies, knapsacks and potato sacks of clothes on their backs, many
people smiled during the entire two-hour journey back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are scared, but it's better to be home then out in the
cold,'' said a village resident named Ramon, who did not want his
last name used. He walked slowly, he said, because he had been
suffering a high fever and his words were interrupted by a hacking
cough.
</P>
<P>
   The resident returned home with no police escort, and with no
promises of protection from government officials. They were
thankful, they said, that their return was being recorded by the
press.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the press to tell the world the truth about our
situation,'' Mario said, upon arriving back at his home of cinder
block and tin. ``If there is a massacre here, the government will
be responsible. They have not offered to help us.''

STUDENT CRITICAL AFTER KNIFING IN HIGH SCHOOL BATHROOM 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON _ A South Boston High School junior was repeatedly
stabbed in a school bathroom allegedly by three schoolmates
Tuesday, setting off a tense daylong stand by authorities to
prevent any further violence.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, Billy Niedzwiecki, 16, of South Boston, was in
intensive care at Boston Medical Center after undergoing more than
three hours of surgery for five stab wounds to the back and
buttocks, including one that punctured his rectum.
</P>
<P>
   Niedzwiecki told police three teenagers robbed and attacked him
as soon he walked into a first-floor bathroom at 7:50 a.m. during
first period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I send my kid to school, I think he is going to be safe, and I
get a call 20 minutes later saying he's stabbed,'' said Cathy
Niedzwiecki, Billy's mother. ``I can't believe this.''
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested a 16-year-old freshman from Mattapan on assault
and battery charges and are expected to issue arrest warrants for
the two other students Wednesday, including one believed to be the
stabber.
</P>
<P>
   All of the suspects are 16 and freshmen at South Boston High. At
least one of the suspects has recently been released from
Department of Youth Services custody.
</P>
<P>
   Several possible motives are being explored, including robbery
because Niedzwiecki had a gold chain ripped from his neck. The
chain was later recovered by an emergency medical technician.
</P>
<P>
   Niedzwiecki is white, and the three suspects are black, but
police said they have ruled out race as a motive.
</P>
<P>
   However students Tuesday said they feared tensions between some
groups of black and white students that have been brewing for
several weeks may erupt in violence.
</P>
<P>
   School officials said students who felt threatened or fearful
could leave school early. Dozens did. Others had parents pick them
up at the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been on edge lately,'' said a 15-year-old female
student who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Two dozen uniformed police escorted students to school buses
after the last bell at 1:40 p.m. to stave off possible
retaliations. Street workers counseled scared students and warned
them not to linger on Southie's streets.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a groggy Niedzwiecki told his mother that as soon as
he walked into a first-floor bathroom, three classmates took $5 he
had and started ``stomping'' on him. ``They busted his glasses,''
Cathy Niedzwiecki said. The three students then ripped the gold
chain _ given to Billy by his grandfather who died two years ago _
off his neck.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and family said Billy either witnessed or was involved
in a fight between South Boston High School students last week. His
mother Cathy said she believed the three students were ``stalking''
her son.
</P>
<P>
   The three allegedly followed Billy into a convenience store
Monday, his aunt said. Described as quiet by friends Tuesday, Billy
Niedzwiecki plays center for the South Boston High School hockey
team.
</P>
<P>
   School officials pledged to beef up security at the school. The
stabbing comes at a time when some parents and students are calling
on schools increase security. The number of school police citywide
has dwindled from 105 in 1985 to 67 this year, according to
sources.
</P>
<P>
   The school will be open Wednesday, and police presence is
expected to be heavy on the last day of school before Christmas
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   While unclear if the incident was racially motivated, students,
parents and community officials commented that it almost didn't
matter: With South Boston's long history of turmoil surrounding
desegregation, almost any incident involving blacks and whites
triggers old memories and strong emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Since the busing crisis of 1974, South Boston High has been
plagued with recurring racial incidents, including brawls in 1977,
1980, and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent incident, racial tensions that had been
smoldering for a month erupted into a melee that involved more than
200 students that sent two students, two police officers, and
then-Mayor Raymond L. Flynn to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday, many students said it was sad that the incident _
racial or not _ could mark another entry in South Boston High's
ledger of pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was racial, but everyone is going to say it
is,'' said one freshman girl who asked not to be identified.

<P>
   With a tense marathon of diplomatic maneuvers behind them and a
fair wind at their backs, the three crew members of the ICO Global
Challenge balloon floated over China Tuesday, more hopeful than
ever of becoming the first balloonists to circle the world nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   After beginning their trip last Friday from Marrakesh, Morocco,
the balloonists were rapidly approaching the halfway mark Tuesday.
Many attempts have been made by balloonists to circle the earth,
but none so far have come close to surmounting the gigantic
obstacles, both diplomatic and technical.
</P>
<P>
   For a time Monday, China denied the big balloon permission to
enter Chinese airspace north of the 26th parallel. Forbidden to
proceed, unwilling to make a suicidal landing in the towering
Himalaya Mountains and unable to change course or turn back,
Richard Branson and his crew mates, Per Lindstrand and Steve
Fossett, faced a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But after the intercession of Britain's prime minister, Tony
Blair, and the British ambassador to China, Anthony Galsworthy, the
Chinese government relented. The balloonists were permitted to
continue, even though that meant traveling north of the 26th
parallel, on condition that they would agree to leave Chinese air
space as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   This the balloonists cheerfully agreed to do.
</P>
<P>
   But the balloon's ground control team at Uxbridge, England,
reported that the delay in crossing China had cost the balloon a
day's time and fuel for its hot-air burners, which might prove to
be critical when and if the balloon nears its goal.
</P>
<P>
   However, Robert Rice, the team's chief meteorologist and a
veteran adviser to many long-distance balloon teams, said in a
telephone interview that wind speeds and direction would probably
improve markedly. He said he expected the ICO Global Challenge to
cross the Chinese coast of the Yellow Sea by nightfall Wednesday,
and then to fly quickly over South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Branson, the billionaire chairman of the Virgin Group in
Britain, was jubilant. He said he hoped his team would be over
America on Christmas Day and would land in Britain (or somewhere in
western Europe) by New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Fossett, a wealthy Colorado commodities broker and sportsman,
has made the round-the-world attempt four times before, each time
flying solo and setting two distance records. A former rival of
Branson's team, he agreed to join it this time.
</P>
<P>
   Fossett made his last try last August, starting from Mendoza,
Argentina. But a ferocious storm hit his balloon while flying over
the Coral Sea, ripping the big gas bag and hurling Fossett's
capsule into the water. He escaped serious injury and was later
rescued by a yacht, but the experience left him shaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I'm scared,'' he said before the launch of the ICO
Global Challenge, ``but the odds look good this time.''

BYRD'S RULES EXPERTISE PUTS HIM AT CENTER OF DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While the White House continues to press its case
for swift punishment rather than a lengthy impeachment trial in the
Republican-led Senate, the key to President Clinton's fate may lie
in the hands of a fellow Democrat: Robert C. Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   The former majority leader from West Virginia is known as the
unofficial parliamentarian of the Senate, holder of the rules book,
a political scholar to whom even Republicans defer on
constitutional matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``All indications are that the Senate is going to take its cues
from Senator Byrd,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican
of Kentucky who is chairman of the Rules Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Some senators are privately worried that the silver-haired
orator _ no friend of Clinton's and a stickler for the rules in any
case _ could impede any attempt to reach a speedy bipartisan
conclusion to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd is expected to insist on proper procedure, just as he did
last year when he refused to allow a blind legislative fellow to
bring her guide dog into the Senate chamber because the rules did
not permit it. (A compromise was eventually reached.)
</P>
<P>
   If anyone knows how to slow Senate proceedings to a crawl _ or
bring them to a complete halt _ it is Byrd, whose deft tactical
maneuvers and marathon speeches led former majority leader Bob Dole
to coin the phrase ``Byrdlock.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Byrd's influence will make itself felt,'' said one senator who
asked for anonymity. ``There will be great deference to Byrd and an
effort to satisfy his concerns. If he becomes obstructionist or
difficult, we know there are 51 senators who also have a vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House, desperate to avoid the public spectacle of a
trial, is trying to arrange a meeting with Byrd to ``sound him out
on his thinking,'' according to a Senate Democratic aide.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into his fifth decade in the Senate, the 81-year-old
senator who wrote the definitive four-volume history of the chamber
has an allegiance as much to the ``the prerogatives and
prerequisites of the Senate'' as much as to his party.
</P>
<P>
   As for the president, one Democratic senator close to Byrd said:
``In his heart of hearts he would like to see a trial. He believes
Clinton has no understanding or appreciation of the role of
Congress. He wants to see the Senate's role protected, and frankly,
he doesn't care what happens to the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokespeople for Byrd did not comment, instead referring
reporters to Byrd's Monday statement.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd said it is up to the Senate, and no one else, to come up
with a bipartisan solution, and he declined to affirm the
conventional view that the Constitution requires the Senate to hold
a trial, however brief, of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether there is a trial or whether there is some other
solution, that decision must be made by senators, and it must be
bipartisan or it will have absolutely no credibility with the
public,'' he said in his written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's pronouncement leaving open the possibility of no trial
was considered so important inside the Beltway that it made the
front page of the Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   But Senator John Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, said that
although he respects Byrd's role in developing the rules, Byrd
should not be able to call the shots _ especially if he prolongs
the process when most other senators want to end it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the greatest respect for Robert Byrd, but I don't think
we ought to overplay his influence in this situation,'' Chafee
said. ``I know he will be sticky about rules, but he is but one
voice out of 100.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Senators Patrick Leahy of Vermont and John F. Kerry
of Massachusetts have said they believe the Senate is reaching
consensus on the need for speedy disposition of the impeachment
charges against the president. But they believe a trial is
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   As for White House preparations for a trial, the office of the
White House counsel, said spokesman Jim Kennedy, was not commenting
on specific meetings or discussions with any politicians. Kennedy
said only that Clinton ``continued preparations for a Senate trial
while looking for a bipartisan solution.''
</P>
<P>
   But it appears the president, buoyed by the highest public
approval ratings of his term, is winning at least some senators to
his side.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats like Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut and
Republicans such as Judiciary Committee chairman Orrin Hatch of
Utah already have come out against a trial if there are not enough
votes to convict the president at the outset.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever senators decide, Republicans and Democrats alike will
have to consider Byrd, who may yet deliver the final say on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Byrd believes in something with strength, he can be
relentless,'' Leahy said. ``He is a force to be reckoned with.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd is a child of the Depression educated in a two-room West
Virginia schoolhouse. Byrd put himself through law school while in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Known for his fiery speeches and exhaustive filibustering
efforts that often run past the midnight hour, Byrd has literally
maneuvered and talked many important bills to death, including a
balanced budget amendment.
</P>
<P>
   In his filibusters, Byrd has been known to recite the names of
all US presidents and British monarchs in order. The King James
Bible, the Magna Carta, the framers of the Constitution and the
meaning of life are also subjects he has explored on the Senate
floor, mixing spicy Appalachian aphorisms with classical
Greco-Roman references as he talks.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the Senate, say his colleages, plays a meaner fiddle
or talks a better game.

<P>
   In virtually every major poll taken in recent weeks, the people
who believe that President Clinton should be removed from office
are in the minority. But they are clearly resolute in their
opinion, with most saying that the president lied both under oath
and in his famous early pronouncement to the nation that he ``did
not have sexual relations with that woman,'' and that such lies are
automatic grounds for dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   And many of these people seem genuinely bewildered that more
people do not see it their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I don't even understand what country I'm living
in,'' said Jim Heller, a computer resource specialist in
Sacramento, Calif. ``Are we saying you can have sex with a young
intern in your office, and lie about it, under oath, and it's OK,
your poll numbers are going to go to 70 percent? ''
</P>
<P>
   Others are angry as well. ``Of course he should be out of
office,'' said Marilyn Velardi, a bookkeeper in Hendersonville,
N.C. ``He's not only undermined our judicial system; he's belittled
it.'' Said Gene Morin, a retired truck driver in Lakeland, Fla.:
``As far as someone lying, and expecting me to have their trust
afterward, it doesn't work. When you take the oath of office, you
swear to uphold the law.''
</P>
<P>
   And still others, including some who support much of what the
president has done in office, are distressed to conclude that he is
morally unfit to serve. ``I voted for him twice and it grieves me
to see his behavior,'' said Barbara, a research analyst and
registered Democrat from central Kansas who declined to give her
last name. ``I feel anguished about all of this. But he should not
be in the Oval Office.''
</P>
<P>
   With the prospect of an impeachment trial looming in the Senate,
Clinton's Republican opponents strongly hope that more Americans
will come to make the same bottom-line judgment. But for now,
strong majorities say they disapprove of impeachment and want the
president to finish out his term.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clinton's having become on Saturday only the second
president ever impeached, his job-approval ratings, as measured in
a New York Times/CBS News poll this weekend, climbed 6 points from
the week before, to 72 percent, among his highest ratings ever in
office.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people interviewed for this article, who were in the
random group of Americans selected for that poll, concede that they
have never liked Bill Clinton. ``From the get-go, I've thought he's
a draft-dodger, leftist, liar, slick,'' said Gary Holzhauser, a
58-year-old computer programmer in Tebbetts, Mo. ``Just hearing him
makes me mad.'' And the group of impeachment supporters is
overwhelmingly white, slightly more male than female and heavy with
people who describe themselves as Republicans and conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many who disapprove of many aspects of the president's
conduct in office say they are bothered that, in the end, the
question of his fitness has been boiled down to the matter of his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those contributions from the people in China, that bothers me
more than the Monica stuff,'' said Tracy Hubbard, a 36-year-old
homemaker in New York City. ``That should have been the issue, not
Monica.'' (To be sure, at least one Clinton critic said he did not
care ``how they get him,'' likening the president to Al Capone and
other mobsters who were brought down on tax-evasion charges rather
than the more-deadly crimes they were accused of.)
</P>
<P>
   But the group is also represented by people of all political
persuasions who say they have struggled with what message the
country would send to its children by allowing Clinton to remain in
the top office in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty hard to explain to young people why it's OK for
the leader of your country to lie, but not for anyone else,'' said
Raymond Bohn, a 34-year-old public school teacher from Brownsville,
Texas, and a new father as of 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are the young people going to read in the history
books?'' asked Karla O'Rourke, 60, a herbalist from Ramsey, N.J.,
and self-described political independent. ``It's the man's
integrity. He lied. If I cannot trust him to uphold the values that
we instill in our youth, how can I trust him in any other issue?
</P>
<P>
   Sunny Pak, 42, a psychological counselor in San Diego, also said
she thought Clinton had lost all moral authority to lead, and
should be forced from office. ``He lied,'' she said. ``He pointed
his finger and bit his lip and narrowed his eyes and said he didn't
have a sexual relationship, and he's a bald-faced liar.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

</P>
<P>
   Sammy Paul, 52, a home contractor in Seattle, recalled that he
had once had to cancel his son's ski trip because of an incident in
which his son was untruthful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, it was a very hard thing to do,'' said Paul. ``As
a father trying to raise a son, it would be real easy for me to
just pretend I didn't find out about that and let him go off and
have a good time? But what kind of father would I be if I did that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, Clinton is the highest law-enforcement officer in the
land,'' Paul continued. ``He took an oath. He swore to uphold and
defend the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many others interviewed, Paul also felt that Clinton had
never even repented for lying to the nation. ``I've listened to all
his apologies, and they've turned me more against him,'' he said.
``The only thing he's apologizing for is, `Gee, I'm sorry I got
caught,' and `Gee, I'm so sorry you have to see me this way.' I
still haven't heard him say, `I lied.'''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those interviewed say they well understand the legal
distinction between saying something under oath and saying it
before television cameras while not under oath. But in general,
they said they believed that Clinton deserves removal for lying in
either instance, and said that they believed that such lies
amounted to a ``high crime,'' the standard set for impeachment
under the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the precise definition,'' said Dan Hinchen, 39, a
civil engineer in Cherokee, Iowa (and, in fact, the Constitution
doesn't offer one). ``But he let down the American people by lying
to them. When he lies like that to the people, that's a high crime
right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Some seemed almost more offended by the one major public
statement, unsworn, that the president made at the outset of the
Lewinsky controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he stood there wagging his finger, it was like he was
speaking right to all of us,'' said Ms. Hubbard, of New York. ``He
was so sincere, and I find it a little frightening that he could
just lie like that. We just can't have a president doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether other U.S. presidents had lied to the nation, many
said yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think ever quite as directly as this one does,''
said Marilyn Rinker, who helps to run a Christian summer camp in
central Florida. ``Maybe lying has occurred when lives were in
jeopardy, but not with something as blatant and as unnecessary as
this whole thing was. Sheer arrogance.''
</P>
<P>
   Teri McBrien, 38, an aerospace defense specialist in San Diego,
said she also thought that Clinton's dalliance raised ``national-
security kinds of problems as well, which haven't been brought out
very well. I mean, he was having these conversations on the
telephone with high officials, doing presidential business while
Monica Lewinsky was, you know, with him.''
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, though, those who want the president removed
came back to the issue of what they describe as his dishonesty.
Said Heller, in Sacramento: ``I have two children, a 14-year-old
girl and a 13-year-old boy, and I tell them, I only want two things
from you, and I'll give you the world. Honesty and respect.
President Clinton can't even give the country honesty and respect,
and he should not be our leader.''
</P>
<P>
   And, these people say, they genuinely do not understand why so
many other Americans don't seem to see share their views.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a couple of guys I play golf with, and all of us feel
exactly the same way,'' said Holzhauser, in Missouri. ``We just
can't see where this 70, 75 percent approval thing comes from. We
can't figure out why we're so far out of the mainstream on this.''

SENATE MINORITY LEADER SAYS THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH VOTES FOR REMOVING

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a few days of sounding out sentiment among
his colleagues, Sen. Tom Daschle, the minority leader, said flatly
on Tuesday that the Senate did not currently have the votes to
convict President Clinton and remove him from office. But he said
he thought there was bipartisan support for censuring the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle, D-S.D., made his assessment as a flurry of phone calls
and conversations took place behind the scenes among senators of
both parties searching for a compromise that would bring the
impeachment proceedings expeditiously to a close next year.
</P>
<P>
   While many lawmakers have assumed the Senate would not have the
votes to convict the president, Daschle was the first prominent
figure to canvass sentiment after the House voted Saturday to
impeach Clinton for perjury and for obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said he had reached out to the 45 Senate Democrats and
that he and other Democrats had sounded out some Republicans.
``There isn't support today for conviction,'' he said. ``I do think
there is a great deal of sentiment for a meaningful censure
resolution on both sides.'' He said, ``There's a great deal of
sentiment for some expeditious resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle's comments were echoed on Tuesday by Rep. James
Greenwood, R-Pa., who along with three other moderate House
Republicans have sent a letter to Sen. Trent Lott, the majority
leader, urging the Senate to consider censure over impeachment. ``I
don't know of two people in the country who think you will get 67
senators to remove the president from office,'' Greenwood said in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a fifth Republican, Rep. Bob Franks of New Jersey
who, like the others, voted for impeachment, also endorsed a
censure plan outlined by former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   The president's press secretary, Joe Lockhart, said on Tuesday
that White House officials were not not lobbying senators or trying
to negotiate the terms of a censure proposal. But Lockhart said the
White House is prepared to provide whatever information senators
seek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the White House is willing to work with the Senate,
and to the extent the Senate is interested in knowing what our
position is on this case, what the president's views are, we will
be happy to engage in discussions,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   But officials and senators familiar with the search for some
solution said that Daschle had been working as an unofficial
liaison between the White House and Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Several congressional aides said that there was even sentiment
for censure among Senate conservatives who think that option would
be preferable to simply failing to convict Clinton. ``The Senate is
going to have to do something for true blue conservatives once the
charges are dismissed,'' said one conservative Republican staff
member.
</P>
<P>
   While many Republicans have insisted that the Senate must begin
a trial, it is conceivable that the trial could be ended in just a
few weeks. One option, several officials said, would be to take no
new evidence but simply let the White House and the House managers
make their conflicting legal arguments about whether the offenses
committed by Clinton amount to high crimes and misdemeanors that
warrant his removal from office. The Senate could then take a quick
vote.
</P>
<P>
   One key variable in how things proceed in the Senate is what
route the president ultimately chooses. The White House has adopted
a two-track approach to the pending trial, preparing to mount a
vigorous legal defense while at the same time seeking a compromise
on a censure resolution. A major question, according to several
senators, is whether the president tries to tough it out and win
acquittal in a trial, or whether in the interest of avoiding a
lengthy trial, he bows to censure.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The debate in the Senate comes as a small but growing group of
House Republicans who voted for impeachment are beginning to speak
out in favor of censure in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the time has come ``to heal the nation's wounds,'' Franks
endorsed on Tuesday a censure plan proposed by Ford and Carter that
would require Clinton to admit lying under oath, while also
stipulating that his admission could not be used in any future
criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the letter to Lott signed by Greenwood and
three other Republicans _ Reps. Michael Castle of Delaware,
Sherwood Boehlert of New York and Benjamin Gilman of New York _ is
circulating among about three dozen moderate House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwood said he thought many House Republicans who voted for
impeachment also support censure, but have been unwilling to sign
the letter because they were concerned about ``being accused of
trying to have it both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews on Tuesday, Boehlert, Greenwood and Castle all
said they wanted to spare the country a paralyzing trial. But they
also said they wanted the president to receive some punishment _
such as being required to admit he lied and to pay a fine _ rather
than simply being acquitted after a Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that case, he might go unpunished for a very serious
offense: lying under oath,'' Boehlert said. ``What then would I say
to a cadet at West Point who says, `When I lie, I get expelled.
What about our commander in chief?'''

GRATEFUL PARENTS OF OCTUPLETS STILL A LITTLE STUNNED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LEIGH HOPPER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In their first public statement since they made
history Sunday by becoming parents of the first known set of
surviving octuplets, Nkem Chukwu, 27, and Iyke Louis Udobi, 41,
came across as grateful _ and a little stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very appreciative of the worldwide support ... (and) of
the excellent care Nkem and the children have received. ... It has
been incredible,'' they said in a family statement issued through
Texas Children's Hospital and St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital in
Houston. ``As you can imagine, while we are overwhelmed, all of our
concerns at this time are (for) Nkem and the babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the third day of life for the eight newborns passed
relatively quietly, a fact their doctors took as a good sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, there's been little change. No news is good news.
We do not like to see dramatic changes,'' said Dr. Leonard Weisman,
chief of neonatology at Texas Children's.
</P>
<P>
   Chukwu, who had surgery Monday for abdominal bleeding, showed
marked improvement throughout the day, said her physicians, who
described her as ``alert, happy and excited.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If she continues to improve at this rate, we expect that she
will be released later in the week,'' said Dr. Brian Kirshon, her
doctor at St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital. Weisman said Chukwu has
not seen her babies since she delivered them.
</P>
<P>
   The record-setting births, conceived with the help of fertility
drugs, began shaping up as major media event Tuesday, with a long
line of television trucks idling in front of the hospitals.
ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' broadcast in front of St. Luke's
at daybreak. Representatives of talk-show host Maury Povich called
to donate eight cribs.
</P>
<P>
   Wes Yoder, the Nashville, Tenn.-based agent who represents Bobbi
and Kenny McCaughey, parents of the world's first surviving set of
septuplets, was spotted in the lobby of St. Luke's, which is
connected to Texas Children's. It is not known whether he will be
representing the Houston family.
</P>
<P>
   All eight babies, known as babies A through H because their
parents have not yet named them, remained in critical condition at
Texas Children's.
</P>
<P>
   Weisman defined critical condition as ``life-threatening'' but
``stable,'' neither improving nor deteriorating. The seven babies
who were surgically delivered Dec. 20 are still on ventilators to
help them breathe. Their intravenous diet of sugar and fluids was
bolstered Tuesday with a combination of proteins, fats,
electrolytes, glucose, vitamins and minerals.
</P>
<P>
   Baby A, delivered vaginally Dec. 8, is breathing on her own and
is being fed formula through a nasogastric tube. In addition, she
received an ultrasound that revealed no bleeding in her cranial
area. The bleeding, common in premature infants, can cause cerebral
palsy.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the octuplets were examined by cardiologists at Texas
Children's. Baby E, the smallest infant, was diagnosed with a heart
abnormality, also common to preemies, that can be treated with
medication.
</P>
<P>
   All eight were responding to sound and light, doctors reported.
The babies, who had a combined weight of just over 10 pounds at
birth, have not been weighed since so they can remain as
undisturbed as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Baby E, described as being smaller than a Beanie Baby, is the
hospital's tiniest-ever survivor, weighing just 10.3 ounces, or 320
grams, at birth. Weisman said the smallest survivor ever discharged
from the hospital weighed a good deal more at birth, 444 grams.
</P>
<P>
   The mother's sister-in-law, Leslie Chukwu of Orange, Conn., said
the parents' extended family would help take on the burden of
raising the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way Nkem and her family in Texas can do this by
themselves. It's going to take a village, like they say in
Africa,'' she told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

Hospital Web site at www.texaschildrenshospital.org or the St.

DEADLINE PASSES WITH 400,000 UNDERGROUND TANKS OUT OF COMPLIANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Alaska, Colo., Fla., Iowa, Maine, Md., N.Y., Okla.,
Vt., W.Va., Wyo.)  (rl) 
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thousands of gasoline stations and thousands more
school districts, fire departments and trash collectors that store
fuel in potentially leaky underground tanks now face fines of up to
$11,000 a day unless they shut them down.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline for compliance, midnight Tuesday, was no surprise.
The Environmental Protection Agency set it 10 years ago to permit
owners of the nearly two million tanks then in existence to cope
with the cost of replacing them or equipping them to prevent spills
and leaks into the underground water supply. Congress authorized
the agency to regulate the tanks 14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Browner, EPA administrator, said that a million tanks had
been closed or replaced and that 600,000 others had been equipped
to prevent leaks.
</P>
<P>
   But at least 400,000 tanks subject to leaks remain. Most, Ms.
Browner said, are in small and rural places and handle much lower
volumes of gasoline than big operators. ``The smaller operators are
not the lion's share of the problem,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the ubiquitous logos of the highway, like Mobil, Exxon,
Chevron, Shell and the chains that own service stations and
convenience stores, were prepared for the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   But the companies are peeved by an EPA announcement two weeks
ago that it would tread lightly on small operators for six more
months and concentrate initially on the remaining large operators,
with four or more tanks, that have not yet complied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we can say 86 percent of the tanks owned and operated by
our members are in compliance,'' said Dan Gilligan, executive vice
president of the Petroleum Marketers Association of America, which
represents 9,000 businesses, primarily gasoline wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people had 10 years to get it done, and they've gotten it
done,'' he said. ``The others are probably going to be closed. Now
that we're in compliance, we want the marketplace to be even.''
</P>
<P>
   For small operators, however, even the decade allowed them to
comply has been tough to meet. That goes, too, for those who elect
to go out of business, or in the case of municipal tanks, to close
them down and buy fuel from stations in compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Closing a tank, which requires filling it with dirt or removing
it, costs $5,000 to $11,000, the EPA reports. Upgrading a tank
costs $12,000 or more, and installing a new tank costs around
$30,000. The plunging oil prices of recent years have eroded many
service stations' profits, making it harder to meet such costs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, compliance varies widely from state to state, largely
because the EPA relies heavily on the states to enforce its
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Some states, notably New York, Alabama, West Virginia, Alaska,
Colorado and Oklahoma, have a long way to go to meet the standards,
according to surveys by the EPA and the Petroleum Equipment
Institute in Tulsa, Okla., which gathered the records from state
environmental agencies.
</P>
<P>
   New York has 52,475 underground fuel tanks, of which 78 percent,
or 40,931, do not meet the standards, the surveys show. Only
Alabama, with 80 percent out of compliance, is higher. By contrast,
Florida, Wyoming, Vermont, Maine, Iowa and Maryland are close to
complete compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compliance in Florida is virtually seamless,'' said Stephen
DeLuca, president of Delco Oil in Deland, which owns convenience
stores and sells fuel to government agencies, churches and other
institutions for their vehicles. Only 12 percent of Florida's tanks
do not comply.
</P>
<P>
   ``But EPA's flip,'' as DeLuca called it, in deciding to delay
strict enforcement for small operators, has confused the
marketplace in many other states, he said. Small businesses that
have taken on the cost of compliance are now at a disadvantage in
competing with those that have not, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials said they have adopted two enforcement
strategies. One, with fines of up to $11,000 a day, ``is for
federal facilities, larger businesses and owners of more than four
tanks,'' said Nina Habib Spencer, spokesman for the agency's New
York-New Jersey regional office.
</P>
<P>
   Small operators will be treated more gently. John Mason, chief
of the underground storage tank section at the regional office in
Atlanta, said investigators would issue them citations, impose
fines of up to $1,000 and allow 30 days to make repairs.

STOCK PRICES ARE MIXED AS TREASURY PRICES DECLINE SHARPLY
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks were mixed in fairly light trading Tuesday,
but Treasury prices posted their biggest decline in six weeks,
pushed down by a flow of money from bonds to stocks and a selloff
of Japanese bonds.
</P>
<P>
   With Christmas and New Year's fast approaching, analysts were
reluctant to attribute much significance to the recent swings in
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices, which had moved higher the last three sessions,
were mixed Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrial average edged above
9,000, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index inched to a new
record.
</P>
<P>
   But profit-taking in technology stocks dragged down the NASDAQ
composite index. And small company shares were weaker. Trading
volume on the New York Stock Exchange was relatively light, at just
more than 680 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow rose 55.61 points, or six-tenths of a percent, to
9,044.46. The blue-chip gauge was helped by gains in big consumer
stocks like Procter &AMP; Gamble and Coca-Cola, drug stocks like Merck
and another big jump in the price of IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the S&AMP;P 500 gained 0.73 point, or less than one-tenth
of a percent, to 1,203.57, eclipsing a record set on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Profit-taking in technology stocks like Intel and Microsoft led
the NASDAQ index lower. At the close, the NASDAQ had dropped 17.05
points, or eight-tenths of a percent, to 2,120.98. And the Russell
2000 index of smaller companies declined 1.59 points, or
four-tenths of a percent, to 400.24.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are coasting on our own momentum into the holidays,'' said
Bill Allyn, head of listed trading at Jefferies &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``For now, stocks and bonds appear somewhat uncoupled,'' he
added. ``But bonds have had such a good rally that you would expect
a bit of a pullback.''
</P>
<P>
   In the credit markets, Treasury prices recorded their largest
drop in six weeks. While a sharp selloff in the Japanese
fixed-income market may have contributed, analysts in New York said
the decline just as likely reflected the decision by money managers
to shift money into stocks from bonds.
</P>
<P>
   By late Tuesday, the price of the benchmark 30-year bond had
fallen 1 7/32, to 101 24/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite
direction from the price, rose to 5.13 percent, from 5.06 percent
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds reached their lows late in the day after the Federal
Reserve, as expected, decided not to lower short-term interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bond yields are in a trading range of 4.75 percent to 5.25
percent,'' said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst for Chase
Asset Management. ``That is where we have been and where we will be
until the Fed cuts rates again. No one expects that to happen
anytime soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the consumer stocks that are part of the Dow average,
Coca-Cola rose 1 11/16, to 67 7/16; Merck was up 3 5/16, to 147],
and P&AMP;G gained 2}, to 90.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, which rose to a record on Monday, hit another high Tuesday,
closing at 182\, up 5~.
</P>
<P>
   However, profit-taking hurt other large technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   Intel dropped 3|, to 199 1/16. And Microsoft lost 2, to 138
7/16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since early October, many of the biggest tech stocks have
doubled in value,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at
the First Albany Corporation. ``It was encouraging to see a round
of profit-taking there that the market absorbed very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Discouraging earnings forecasts pushed down prices of some
industrial companies.
</P>
<P>
   Case Corp., the nation's second-largest farm equipment
manufacturer, and Hercules, a big specialty chemicals company, both
fell after warning that profits will not meet expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Case fell 11/16, to 19 13/16. And Hercules dropped 2 7/16, to 26
3/16.

THREE TENORS' PROMOTER SENTENCED IN GERMANY FOR TAX EVASION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ireland)  (Duplication warning: Also moved in `e' category) 
(mk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Matthias Hoffmann, the German promoter who turned the Three
Tenors concerts into a worldwide extravaganza, was sentenced
Tuesday to five years and eight months in prison for tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   A court in Mannheim, Germany, found Hoffmann guilty of evading
close to $10 million in taxes and said it was pursuing
investigations against the tenors _ Luciano Pavarotti, Jose
Carreras and Placido Domingo _ for possible complicity in tax
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Pavarotti recently canceled two Berlin concerts, one with the
Berlin Philharmonic on New Year's Eve and another with Deutsche
Oper on Jan. 25, after lawyers advised him that it was unwise to
come to Germany while the investigation continued. When they
informed German organizers of the cancellations earlier this month,
lawyers for Pavarotti said he would make up for his absence as soon
as the case was resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Carreras and Domingo could not be reached Tuesday for comment.
In New York, Pavarotti's manager, Herbert Breslin, said neither he
nor his client had any comment. ``I'm not privy to the problems
Hoffman has with the German tax authorities,'' Breslin said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffmann, who organized the tenors' world tour in 1996, which
included stops in the United States, Europe and Asia, was arrested
in Germany in July 1997 and has since been held in prison. The
court said Tuesday that the 17 months he had already served would
be deducted from his sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman, 47, dropped out of Mannheim University in 1970 to
present a rock festival that became known as the German Woodstock.
He set up his first concert agency in 1971, and initially focused
on rock music, including concerts by the Rolling Stones and Queen.
By the 1980s, he was also working with Carreras and Domingo,
enjoying what he later described as ``incredible international
success.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s he linked up with the Three Tenors, who had
enjoyed a stunning success with their 1994 sellout concert at
Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles. A dozen more concerts were organized
and beamed to television audiences of hundreds of millions. Audio
and video recordings of the concerts became the best-selling
classical recordings ever.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffmann paid the tenors well: Each received $1.5 million a
concert, German prosecutors said. In 1996 Pavarotti commented:
``Good money, eh? By God, it's good money.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contended at the trial that Hoffmann avoided paying
taxes by illegally splitting the payment for each concert into
$500,000 in salary and $1,000,000 in licensing income, and paying
the latter sum into a front company based in Ireland that
prosecutors believe was controlled by the three tenors.
</P>
<P>
   Under German law, Hoffman should have deducted German taxes from
the salary portion _ something he failed to do _ and should have
explained to the tax authorities why such a large portion of the
overall fee to the artists came in the form of licensing income. He
was also accused of avoiding taxes on a number of other concerts
and events with no link to the tenors.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Hoffmann grew out of the imprisonment of a
Munich concert promoter, Marcel Avram, who was also accused of tax
fraud. Lawyers for Hoffmann, who once described his partnership
with the tenors as ``a winning team,'' had pleaded for a sentence
of less than five years, while choosing not to contest several of
the charges.

N.Y. HIGH COURT VOIDS PORTIONS OF DEATH PENALTY LAW
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ALAN FINDER   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the first major test of New York's reinstituted
death penalty, the state's highest court struck down most of the
law's plea-bargaining provisions Tuesday, saying that they were
unconstitutional because they encouraged defendants to plead guilty
rather than risk a death sentence by going to trial.
</P>
<P>
   A defendant can be executed in New York only after being found
guilty at trial and then sentenced to death by a jury. But
defendants who plead guilty to capital murder cannot be executed;
the maximum penalty on a guilty plea is life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals ruled, in a unanimous decision, that the
plea-bargaining arrangement unfairly burdened defendants who decide
to exercise their constitutional right to a trial.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision left intact the rest of the state law that
reimposed capital punishment in 1995, but prosecutors and defense
lawyers said it would give them much less leeway to negotiate plea
bargains, which would be permitted only in limited circumstances.
More immediately, defense lawyers said, the ruling would make it
extremely difficult for 12 defendants in the state who are awaiting
trials in capital cases to reach plea arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the Court of Appeals repeatedly cited a
30-year-old ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court, which found
unconstitutional a section of a federal kidnapping law that carried
a lower maximum penalty for a guilty plea _ life in prison _ than
the maximum penalty for being found guilty at trial, which was
execution.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Judge Judith Kaye, who wrote the Court of Appeals
decision, said New York's death penalty statute contained the same
flaw that the Supreme Court found in the federal law. ``Only those
defendants who exercise the Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination and the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial
put themselves at risk of death,'' Judge Kaye wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Kaye noted that courts in five other states had
invalidated similar plea-bargaining provisions in death penalty
laws for the same reason. ``By statutory mandate,'' she wrote,
``the death penalty hangs over only those who exercise their
constitutional rights to maintain innocence and demand a jury
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   In nearly all of the 39 states with the death penalty, a
defendant accused of capital murder can plead guilty and still face
execution. That seldom if ever actually happens, though, because
defendants generally negotiate arrangements in which they plead
guilty and receive less than the maximum sentence for any crime.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Kaye said in a footnote to the seven-page decision that
New York was now the only state whose death penalty law carries a
different maximum punishment for a plea bargain and for being found
guilty at trial.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals appeared to be suggesting that the state
Legislature could fix the constitutional flaw in the statute by
rewriting it to contain the same maximum penalty whether a
defendant is found guilty by a jury or pleads guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki said in a statement that he would ``consider
legislation to address the court's concerns.'' The governor also
urged some of those in the complex lawsuit _ which involved two
murder cases, one in Brooklyn and another in Rochester _ to appeal
the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, to see whether it would
reconsider its 1968 ruling that was the basis of the Court of
Appeals' decision.
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes, said he would appeal
the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. Hynes' office had
negotiated a plea arrangement in one of the two cases, which
involved Michael Shane Hale, who was charged with killing his
companion, Stefan Tanner, in October 1995 and cutting up his body
with a saw. Hale had agreed to plead guilty to murder and to serve
at least 50 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Albert Tomei of state Supreme Court in Brooklyn
rejected the settlement, ruling that the plea-bargaining provisions
were unconstitutional because ``the possibility of death only
arises from the defendant's exercise of his right to a jury
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   A state appeals court overturned the judge's decision last year,
saying that there were important differences between New York's
law, in which a defendant cannot plead guilty without a
prosecutor's consent, and the federal kidnapping law, in which a
defendant could choose to plead guilty on his own.
</P>
<P>
   In striking down the plea provisions, the Court of Appeals
reversed the appellate decision _ just as it did in the Rochester
case _ and argued that the constitutional flaws in the New York and
federal laws were indistinguishable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our reversal in these cases may well have an ironic twist in
that capital defendants will have fewer opportunities to avoid the
possibility of the death penalty,'' Judge Kaye wrote. Hynes and
several defense lawyers agreed, saying that their discretion to
negotiate plea arrangements would be limited by the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   But the Court of Appeals said that there were still several
circumstances in which plea arrangements could be negotiated. For
example, New York's prosecutors have 120 days after indicting
someone on a charge of first-degree murder to decide whether to
pursue the death penalty. A district attorney could negotiate a
plea arrangement after indicting a murder defendant _ but before
formally deciding to seek the death penalty in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Doyle, the state's capital defender, said the only
defendants directly affected by the court's decision were the 12
people in the state who have been indicted for first-degree murder
and been told that prosecutors would seek capital punishment. All
12 defendants are awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruling will make it extremely hard for these
defendants to negotiate plea arrangements, Doyle said. A prosecutor
would have to be willing to reduce the charges to second-degree
murder, which does not carry the possibility of execution _ a
prospect that Doyle and other lawyers in his office considered
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The winner here is the federal Constitution, and certainly
neither defendants nor prosecutors,'' Doyle said. ``No benefit
redounds to defendants or prosecutors from this.''

SPORTS COLUMN: NURTURING THE DREAM OF VALVANO  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By IRA BERKOW    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Pam Valvano took her husband Jimmy's pants to the dry
cleaners, she would often find index cards on which he had written
notations, or the cards might be scattered here or there in their
home. Some had to do with recruiting he planned as head coach of
the North Carolina State basketball team in Raleigh. Others may
have been about a speaking engagement, or a play he had devised, or
a saying he had run across and wished to share.
</P>
<P>
   One index card, written perhaps in late April 1993, was found in
the desk drawer of his hospital room. It read: ``Learn to paint.
Learn to play the piano. Find a cure for cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was probably the last card he ever wrote,'' said Pam
Valvano. ``And that was Jimmy, optimistic, trying to live life to
the fullest, and still trying to laugh through the pain _ he knew
he'd never paint or play the piano again.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Valvano died of bone cancer on Wednesday morning, April
28, 1993, at the Duke Medical Center in Durham, N.C. He was 47, and
left Pam and their three daughters, Nicole then 24, Jamie, 21, and
LeeAnn, 13.
</P>
<P>
   Valvano is perhaps remembered best for that stunning moment when
his underdog N.C. State team beat Houston in the 1983 NCAA
championship final on a last-second shot, and the gap-toothed coach
burst onto the court, his dark hair flying, the tail of his sport
jacket flapping, searching for anyone, or everyone, to hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the national champions!'' he exulted that night in a
hotel lobby in Albuquerque, N.M.. ``We're on top of the world! It's
unbelievable. I feel terrible.'' He was suffering from the flu;
under the circumstances, however, it was inconsequential.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years to the month after that, in the hospital bed, Valvano
knew the end was near, that there was no cure for his deadly
disease. He had lost hair from chemotherapy, was underweight and
pale, and understood he'd have no need for an easel or sheet music.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he really thought he could help fight the disease _ for
others,'' said Valvano's friend and rival basketball coach, Mike
Krzyzewski, of Duke. Coach K regularly visited Valvano in the
hospital. ``He wanted to have experimental drugs tried on him. He
knew he was beyond their helping him, but maybe the experiments
would help someone else. And then there was the foundation he
wanted to organize to assist cancer researchers. He studied this.
He told me that the U.S. government gives grants to only one out of
five or six research groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Jimmy told me, `Mike, maybe there's some good young
doctors and researchers out there like some good young basketball
coaches who just aren't getting a chance.'''
</P>
<P>
   And Valvano did establish a foundation for cancer research _ The
V Foundation, in Cary, N.C. _ which since its inception in 1993 has
awarded 28 grants totaling more than $4 million. And one of the
ways the foundation raises money is by putting on the annual Jimmy
V Basketball Classic, which was played for the fourth year, Tuesday
night, in the Meadowlands. One of four teams competing in the
doubleheader was, of course, Krzyzewski's Duke, which played
Kentucky. Purdue played South Carolina in the other game.
</P>
<P>
   Valvano encountered some problems in his coaching days, when he
was pilloried by critics because of low test scores of incoming
basketball players, because of the low number of his players
graduating. That he occupied a lower rung on the ladder of those
who can have a hand in the abuses in big-time college sports _
school presidents, trustees, admissions directors, among others,
are hardly innocents _ paled in contrast to the attention the coach
receives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember that he cared about his players very much,'' said
Pam Valvano, ``and he'd always try to prepare them for, as he used
to say, `When the cheering stops.'''
</P>
<P>
   Pam _ who, as are her daughters, is deeply involved in the
Foundation _ met Jimmy when both attended Seaford High School on
Long Island. Jimmy took her to the junior prom. She said she fell
in love with his wit, his humor, his warmth. They were married for
25 years. And, yes, she said, he had some regrets: of perhaps
pursuing his basketball success too hard, of running too fast to
realize his dreams, of missing important family moments.
</P>
<P>
   Once, after losing a game on Dec. 19, he was so depressed he was
going to cancel Christmas with his family. ``We gave him some
perspective on that,'' she said, meaning there was a Christmas at
the Valvano home that year.
</P>
<P>
   Did Pam Valvano remember her husband's last words to her?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she said. She paused. ``He said, `I love you.'''

INQUIRY INTO FRITO-LAY FINDS NO WRONGDOING IN MARKETING
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Texas) (fb) 
By DANA CANEDY   
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Justice Department has closed its investigation into the
competitive practices of the Frito-Lay unit of Pepsico Inc. with no
finding of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two years, the government had been looking into
possible anti-competitive practices within the salty-snack
industry, centering largely on Frito-Lay, the dominant company.
Smaller competitors had complained that Frito-Lay was buying huge
blocks of space on supermarket shelves and securing exclusive
promotions as a way of locking out smaller makers of snacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department confirmed a report in The Wall Street
Journal on Monday that the investigation had been closed.
Frito-Lay, which had revenue last year of $10.4 billion, said that
it had never engaged in unlawful trade practices. ``We are very
pleased with their decision,'' said Lynn Markley, a spokeswoman for
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimate that Frito-Lay, the maker of Fritos and
Doritos, controls well over half the salty- snack business. Its
share has steadily grown as it has introduced successful new
products. The unit has also gained as several competitors, like
Anheuser-Busch and Borden Inc., left the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our standpoint, there never has been any mystery as to
how we've been successful over the years,'' Markley added. ``Our
commitment to the business and growing in our business have allowed
us to stay ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Frito-Lay was known for its aggressive industry
practices but that the government's decision to end the inquiry
without a finding of wrongdoing bolstered the company's position
that it was not breaking the law with its heavy-handed marketing
practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is Frito-Lay is kind of damned for being so big,
but big doesn't necessarily mean bad,'' said George Thompson, an
analyst who follows the company and the supermarket industry for
Prudential Securities. ``I'm sure they are very aggressive, but my
experience has been that they are also very aware of what their
position is relative to everyone else and they have to be very,
very careful.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that although small competitors might feel overwhelmed
by Frito-Lay's dominance, supermarket operators devote big blocks
of shelf space to the company's products because, like soft drinks,
popular snacks drive store traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he said, Frito-Lay is a leader in efficiency and passes on
part of its cost savings to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supermarkets develop their brand franchises in large part
based on the value they provide a consumer with,'' Thompson said.
``Supermarkets are going to be much more inclined to give
promotional space to the leading brands.''

SUHARTO SON-IN-LAW GETS JORDANIAN CITIZENSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ A son-in-law of former President Suharto
has been given honorary citizenship in Jordan, the official Antara
press agency reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, 11 Indonesian soldiers once commanded by the
son-in-law, Prabowo Subianto, are to go on trial on charges of
abducting and torturing political dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   Prabowo, a former lieutenant general and commander of the
Kopassus commando force, was honorably discharged on Dec. 10, after
having accepted responsibility for the kidnapping and torture of
Suharto's political opponents. He has been living in Amman, Jordan,
for four months, said his brother Hashim Djojohadikusumo, who added
that Prabowo had several ailments, including malaria and liver and
kidney disease.
</P>
<P>
   The trial of the commandos, in connection with the abduction and
torture of 24 people this year, will be in a military court. One
victim was found dead and 13 are missing.
</P>
<P>
   Prabowo and two other senior officers may face a court-martial
if evidence is shown to link them to human rights abuses, the
military says. Prabowo has said he is willing to return here to
testify if required, his brother said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, State Secretary Akbar Tangjung said the government
was about to wrap up its investigation. ``The process will be aimed
at ascertaining the extent of retired Lt. Gen. Prabowo's
involvement in the case,'' Tangjung said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Minister Muladi _ who like many Indonesians uses only
one name _ warned Prabowo Tuesday not to accept Jordanian
citizenship. ``We do not recognize dual citizenship,'' Muladi said.
``Once someone accepts another citizenship he loses Indonesian
citizenship.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, President B.J. Habibie pledged that the government
would continue to investigate the role of the military in the
rioting, arson and looting in May that left 1,200 people dead and
ended the 32-year autocratic reign of Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Tangjung also said the government would ``soon finalize the
judicial process'' in the case of a fatal shooting by the military
of six Trisakti University students in the days before the riots.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, in the face of widespread opposition, the
government decided to postpone the creation of a 40,000-member
civilian militia. The idea for the militia was put forward by the
armed forces chief, General Wiranto, as a way to increase law and
order, especially before elections scheduled for June 7.

REEBOK TO TAKE $10M CHARGE IN 4TH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reebok International Ltd., the athletic footwear giant, plans to
take a fourth-quarter charge of $10 million that is partly related
to laying off about 100 employees at its Stoughton, Mass.
headquarters over the past three months.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the layoffs, the staff at headquarters now numbers
about 1,800 employees. Layoffs were ``across the board,'' from the
executive suite to administrative help, said a company spokesman
who declined to identify any of the names of those who lost their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been making the necessary adjustments to address the
current business climate, and we are prepared to do what is
necessary to return the company to greater profitability in the
future,'' said Reebok chairman and chief executive Paul Fireman in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Reebok's troubles stems from industrywide woes. Demand
has softened for many styles of sneakers, and the lockout of the
National Basketball Association has made matters worse.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in problems with the Asian and Latin American economies, a
fashion cycle that seems to have shifted a bit in favor of hiking
boots and so-called brown shoes, and a glut of athletic apparel
stores, and 1998 is a year most sneaker companies would like to
forget.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Nike Inc., the number one athletic footwear company,
said last week quarterly earnings had fallen 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is definitely going through some difficult
times,'' noted Fireman, who recently brought in Carl Yankowski from
Sony Electronics and Angel Martinez from the company's Rockport
subsidiary to help move the Reebok brand forward.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok said problems in Brazil and its Scandinavian
distributor's declaration of bankruptcy were among the reasons for
plans to take a fourth-quarter charge that works out to 18 cents a
share.
</P>
<P>
   At First Call Corp., the average fourth quarter earnings
estimate of analysts polled was 4 cents a share. In the fourth
quarter of 1997, Reebok earned 32 cents a diluted share before
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Black, an analyst with Black &AMP; Co., said Reebok's
announcement was hardly unexpected, given the context of
industrywide problems that makes the fate of smaller players such
as Fila and Converse uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environment is `What can go wrong will go wrong,' '' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Black had high praise for Reebok's new line of DMX sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're great shoes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But great shoes may not be enough in this environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is it will turn around someday,'' Black said of the
athletic footwear industry as a whole. ``But are we seeing signs of
a turnaround right now? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Reebok made its announcement after the market closed. On the New
York Stock Exchange, share were up 1/8 to close at 14 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok shares have lost more than half their value this year.

MARKET PLACE: SEC CHARGES GRACE AND 6 FORMER EXECUTIVES WITH FRAUD
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Fla., Mass.)  (fb) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal securities regulators on Tuesday charged W.R. Grace &AMP;
Co. and six of its former executives with fraud, saying the company
had deceived shareholders over five years by falsely reporting
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The move was part of a larger plan by the Securities and
Exchange Commission to crack down on the growing number of
companies, including some of the nation's largest, that break
accounting rules so they can manipulate earnings and meet Wall
Street's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear from companies that say, `Everybody is doing it, so why
can't we,' '' said Richard H. Walker, the SEC's director of
enforcement. ``This is an area of great concern.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a civil complaint filed in U.S. District Court in
Miami, Grace, a large chemicals company based in Boca Raton, Fla.,
was blessed with unexpected revenue in the early 1990s. But instead
of reporting all that revenue, the complaint said, executives moved
$10 million to $20 million to later years when business was not as
good.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators said that by using the false accounting, the company
was able to report that revenue was on the rise for its health care
group from 1991 to 1993, even though actual revenue was declining.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the amount of revenue involved, the SEC said in
the complaint, Grace management had misled investors just by not
disclosing that it ``was engaged in an ongoing scheme to
fraudulently manipulate its reported earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Grace said Tuesday that it would
``vigorously contest'' the accusations. The statement said the
company believed its accounting in past years was proper and that
the litigation should not have a significant impact on current
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The company said none of the executives involved in the
questioned accounting still worked for the company. And, it said
that its outside auditing firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, was aware
of the accounting and had not raised any objections.
</P>
<P>
   David Nestor, a spokesman for PriceWaterhousecoopers, said that
the accounting firm did not comment on client matters. ``But we
stand behind our work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's share price fell $1.5625, or 9.65 percent, to
$14.625, after the SEC's announcement on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators said Grace executives had declined to report $10
million to $20 million in revenue that the company had received in
the early 1990s from a change in the Medicare reimbursement rules
because the executives believed that it would not help the
company's stock price. At the time, the company was already
reporting revenue at a rate that Wall Street was expecting. So
instead, according to the complaint, the executives set aside the
unexpected Medicare revenue in another account and then gradually
used it to increase revenue from 1993 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you manipulate earnings to show what you want to show and
to not show the actual results,'' Walker said, ``shareholders are
deceived.''
</P>
<P>
   Regulators are continuing their investigation into Grace's
accounting, he said, and plan to file similar complaints against
other companies.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint filed on Tuesday in Miami seeks civil penalties
and asks for an injunction restraining the company and its
executives from further violations of federal securities laws.
</P>
<P>
   The revenue that the SEC is questioning was earned by a Grace
subsidiary, National Medical Care Inc. of Waltham, Mass. The
company sold National Medical Care, which operates kidney dialysis
clinics, to Fresenius AG of Germany in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators said Grace executives used the unexpected revenue
received by National Medical Care for ``profit planning purposes.''
The amounts, which were improperly deferred in the accounting books
by setting up reserve accounts, were used later to boost revenue of
the health care group to meet Wall Street's expectations and to
increase the company's earnings reported in its consolidated
financial statements.
</P>
<P>
   For example, for the fourth quarter of 1994, Grace senior
managers asked executives at National Medical Care to report an
additional $1.5 million in income, the regulators said, because
Grace needed that amount to increase its consolidated earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators also filed an administrative complaint against the
former Grace executives, including J. P. Bolduc, who had been chief
executive, charging that they helped issue the financial reports
that the regulators say are false.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Walpin, a lawyer for Bolduc, said that his client would
contest the charges and ``expects to be vindicated.'' He said the
charges ``are an attempt to punish a chief executive for performing
his responsibilities exactly as a responsible CEO should.'' &QL;

   ROME _ At its last meeting before the adoption of a single
currency, the European Central Bank signaled Tuesday that there
would be no immediate cuts in interest rates when the euro is
introduced next month.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting on Tuesday of its central council in Frankfurt, the
bank set a narrow one-month interest rate corridor around its main
lending rate of 3 percent, apparently aimed at smoothing money
market operations and avoiding rate volatility in the infancy of
the new currency.
</P>
<P>
   Wim Duisenberg, the Dutch president of the central bank, said
Tuesday's decisions were intended to demonstrate that the bank
``does not want to give any signal for a further easing in the
foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   The moves came less than three weeks after 10 of the 11 nations
in the euro zone simultaneously cut their main refinancing rate to
3 percent. The 11th, Italy, dropped its rate to 3.5 percent.
Duisenberg said Rome could theoretically remain out of step until
Dec. 31, when the Italian central bank loses its autonomy within
the European Central Bank system.
</P>
<P>
   From Jan. 4, when money markets reopen after the New Year's
holiday weekend, through Jan. 21, the bank's marginal borrowing
rate, its most expensive, will be set at 3.25 percent, and the
deposit rate, the least expensive, at 2.75 percent, creating a
narrow corridor around the central refinancing rate of 3 percent
set on Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   At its next meeting, on Jan. 21, it said it would change this
rate range, lifting the marginal rate to 5.5 percent and lowering
the deposit rate to 2 percent, in a move perhaps intended to assure
the flexibility required to deal with any global economic slowdown.
This would be done without budging the key refinancing rate, which
would stay at 3 percent. These rates are used by the central bank
to limit the interest rates charged each day by commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
   The 2 percent deposit rate is even lower than the German central
bank's comparable discount rate, of 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Duisenberg said the narrow interest corridor for money market
rates aimed at ``smoothing the adaptation for the participants in
the euro money market during the initial days of monetary union.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing signs that recessions in emerging-market economies were
beginning to dampen European growth, economists said the decisions
left the bank room to maneuver if conditions worsened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a conservative range of interest rate targets,'' said J.
Paul Horne, chief European equity market economist at Salomon Smith
Barney in London, describing the interest rate environment as
``extraordinary and without precedent,'' given the extremely low
levels of inflation and dangers of global slowing.
</P>
<P>
   Horne said that the market meltdown in Russia last summer was
having a ``fairly serious'' slowing effect on European economies,
most notably in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to leave themselves lots of leeway to react
credibly and appropriately,'' Horne said of the central bankers.
</P>
<P>
   But Duisenberg, speaking at a news conference after the bank's
last meeting before it assumes rate-setting control for the
countries embracing the single currency, was at pains to discourage
expectations of any further rate cuts soon. He noted that the 3
percent key rate set early this month was ``very low by historical
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   The key rates are comparable to the Federal funds rate in the
United States, the target rate for overnight loans between banks,
which is now 4.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The European bank will set monetary policy for Germany, France,
Italy, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Belgium, Finland,
Luxembourg, Ireland and Austria in January, after these countries
lock their exchange rates together to form a common currency.
</P>
<P>
   Coins and banknotes will not be introduced for three years, but
all interbank transactions, as well as the pricing of equities and
bonds within the zone, will be done in euros.

STANDARD &AMP; POOR'S DOWNGRADES TOSHIBA LONG-TERM DEBT RATING
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Standard &AMP; Poor's lowered its long-term credit ratings
Tuesday on Toshiba Corp.'s debt, saying the company's efforts to
strengthen itself financially will likely be hurt by a swift
erosion in cash flow and adverse global market conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The downgrade was sobering because Toshiba, which manufactures
everything from batteries and household appliances to power
generation equipment and sophisticated computer chips, is regarded
here as having gone further than most corporations to overhaul
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Under its president, Taizo Nishimuro, the company has exited
less profitable businesses, streamlined corporate governance and
adopted a plan to reduce jobs. The company also intends to reduce
the number of affiliates _ and therefore obligations to them _ to
300, from 1,000, by April 1999, and to whittle its labor force to
60,000, from 66,000, by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But Standard &AMP; Poor's was apparently unswayed, pushing the
company's long-term ratings to triple-B-plus from A-minus.
``Although these actions will help the company improve its
performance over the next several years, the scale and timing of
the benefits of restructuring are uncertain,'' the ratings agency
said.
</P>
<P>
   It pointed to weakness in the semiconductor market, a slowdown
in capital investment among Japanese electrical companies and the
uncertain demand for personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Toshiba shares, which had risen 50 percent over the last three
months on the company's restructuring efforts, fell 4 percent, or
28 yen, on the downgrade news to 677 yen, or about $5.84.
</P>
<P>
   A lowered credit rating can make it more expensive for
corporations to borrow by issuing bonds, because investors demand a
higher rate of return on securities considered more risky. But
Toshiba said through a spokesman that the company did not expect
the ratings change to significantly increase its borrowing costs.  &QL;

 UNIT OF RJR NABISCO PLEADS GUILTY IN CIGARETTE SMUGGLING SCHEME 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: The second take is scheduled to move by 9:30 p.m. ET) 
(sw) 
 By CHRISTOPHER DREW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A unit of the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. pleaded guilty on
Tuesday to federal criminal charges stemming from a scheme to
smuggle cigarettes into Canada through an Indian reservation in
upstate New York and agreed to pay $15 million in penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said the guilty plea, filed in Federal District
Court in Binghamton, N.Y., marked the first time that a tobacco
company has been convicted of complicity in the shadowy and growing
world of international cigarette smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   Experts estimate that nearly one-fourth of the billions of
American cigarettes sold overseas pass through smuggling rings set
up to evade taxes and sell major brands at a discount. Critics have
long contended that this trade could not go on without the
industry's knowledge and support.
</P>
<P>
   But while previous criminal investigations have led to charges
against several mid-level managers, top executives at the large,
multinational tobacco companies have always denied allegations that
they encouraged or condoned any dealings with the contraband rings.
</P>
<P>
   In entering the guilty plea, the RJR Nabisco subsidiary,
Northern Brands International Inc., admitted that it helped
distributors evade $2.5 million in U.S. excise taxes on shipments
that, the authorities said, were ultimately smuggled into Canada to
avoid high taxes on cigarettes there.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's plea also could have sweeping repercussions in
Washington, where Congress has debated whether to raise the taxes
on domestic cigarette sales to discourage smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives have argued that any significant increase in
the taxes would immediately create a black market for cigarettes in
the United States, much as it did in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   But the guilty plea ``shows that the emperor doesn't have any
clothes in making that argument,'' said Gregory N. Connoly, the
director of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' Tobacco Control
Program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies have always said that they are not directly
involved, and they have used the threat of smuggling to dissuade
Congress from raising the taxes,'' he said. ``But now we have
evidence that the industry is complicit with organized criminals
when it comes to smuggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas J. Maroney, the U.S. attorney in Syracuse, N.Y., said the
four-year-old investigation was continuing. But he declined to say
whether any high-level officials at RJR Nabisco's main tobacco
operation, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., or other tobacco companies
were under scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Top executives and spokesmen at R.J. Reynolds, based in
Winston-Salem, N.C., could not be reached for comment on Tuesday
night. But Maroney said that the company had agreed to cooperate
with investigators and had taken steps to insure that similar
violations do not happen again.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg News quoted a R.J. Reynolds lawyer, C. Stephen Heard
Jr., as saying that the company ``regrets this episode.'' According
to the news service, Heard said that Northern Brands' actions were
``inconsistent with the way Reynolds does business'' and that
Reynolds had closed Northern Brands.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Northern Brands arose from an investigation
that has led to guilty pleas by more than 20 people involved in
smuggling hundreds of millions of dollars worth of alcohol and
cigarettes into Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents released during the investigation showed that
R.J. Reynolds, the second-largest American cigarette maker next to
the Philip Morris Cos., sponsored trips to a luxury Canadian
fishing resort for several distributors who lived in upstate New
York and smuggled cigarettes into Canada. One R.J. Reynolds sales
manager even joked with the dealers about the smuggling, the
documents said.
</P>
<P>
   The smuggling took off after Canada raised taxes in the 1980s
and the early 1990s to discourage cigarette consumption, one of the
first countries to try this approach. The taxes did not apply to
exports, and affiliates of the three biggest companies _ Philip
Morris, R.J. Reynolds and BAT Industries PLC _ started shipping
large amounts of Canadian brands, like Players and Export A, to the
United States even though few Americans smoke them.
</P>
<P>
   Maroney said that without paying either the Canadian or the
American taxes, distributors then moved the cigarettes back into
Canada through the St. Regis Mohawk Indian Reservation in upstate
New York, with the help of some Indian leaders who also have been
convicted in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's guilty plea, R.J. Reynolds' Northern Brands unit
admitted to participating in one crucial part of the scheme.

SEATTLE SCHOOLS BAN LASER POINTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH TEICHROEB  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Penlike laser pointers, the latest high-tech fad among
teenagers, have been banned in Seattle schools following a rash of
complaints about pranksters aiming the red beams of light at human
targets.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Superintendent Joseph Olchefske said that both safety
concerns and students' disruptive behavior with laser pointers
prompted the district to ban the devices for students.
</P>
<P>
   ``These laser pens can be everything from a distraction to a
real danger,'' Olchefske said. ``We see them as a real problem and
want to get them out of the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   School districts around the country, from New York City to
Chicago, also have banned the hand-held laser pointers in the wake
of complaints from teachers, students and even school bus drivers,
who reported near-accidents after having the beam flashed in their
eyes on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo this month, the Seattle School District's legal
counsel advised principals to notify parents that possession and
use of laser pointers by students is prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   Students who aim laser pointers at another person could face
charges of disruptive conduct. If the device is deliberately shone
in someone's eyes, the offender could be charged with assault, the
memo warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told principals to look at the intent of how it's used,''
Olchefske said. ``If it's used as a malicious weapon, you have to
look at far more serious sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   Olchefske said he hadn't heard about any incidents where laser
pointers had been used as a weapon in Seattle schools.
</P>
<P>
   Warning labels on the product tell consumers not to shine the
devices in their eyes, retailers say.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say the beam will only cause damage if shone directly
into the eyes for about 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that if they are used properly, there's no
risk,'' said Dr. Robert Kalina, a opthamology professor at the
University of Washington. ``If you stared into it for more than 10
seconds, I think there would be some damage to the retina. But
you'd have to work at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people would instinctively blink and turn away from the
light before that, Kalina said. Still, there's no harm in being
cautious, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never underestimate what teenagers will do,'' Kalina said.
``There may be someone who would deliberately try something like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The most inexpensive laser pointers emit a low-intensity beam of
red light for about 100 yards and were originally designed to
highlight text during classroom or business presentations.
</P>
<P>
   As the gadgets became cheaper and smaller, their popularity with
teenagers took off. Stores sell laser pointers for $30 to $100,
said Dennis McCrae, Radio Shack's district sales manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very popular,'' he said. ``Most kids don't have $70 to
buy them, but their parents do because the kids want them.''
</P>
<P>
   At South Shore Middle School in South Seattle, Principal Bihoa
Caldwell said the main problem has been male students using the
pointers to highlight girls' breasts and other body parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the latest toy,'' she said. ``We've told students we'll
not only take them away, but if they're shining it in someone's
eyes, we'll treat it as an assault.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the Broadway revival of Leonard Bernstein's ``On
the Town,'' there's a hilarious sendup of a pretentious, boozy
voice teacher called Madame Maude P. Dilly, played with gusto by
Mary Testa. In the scene, the character Ivy Smith, who works as an
exotic dancer at Coney Island but harbors higher aspirations, has
come for her lesson. Madame Dilly puts Ivy through the whoops,
shouts and scales that constitute the vocal warm-up regimen of
opera singers. For good measure, she throws in a stern admonition
about dedication to art:
</P>
<P>
   Do do re do
</P>
<P>
   Love life must go,
</P>
<P>
   If you'd be a nightingale
</P>
<P>
   instead of a crow.
</P>
<P>
   The lyrics are by Betty Comden and Adolph Green, who also wrote
the book for this 1944 show, their first. This would not be the
only time the celebrated team of lyricists poked fun at opera. In
``Two on the Aisle,'' a 1951 collaboration with the composer Jule
Styne, they wrote a duet called ``Catch Our Act at the Met,'' in
which Bert Lahr, as a fur-clad Siegfried, and Dolores Gray, as a
leggy chorus line Bruennhilde, fantasize about bringing some
show-biz verve to the citadel of opera.
</P>
<P>
   Opera always has been fair game, and a pretty easy target, for
Ms. Comden and Green, both 83 and professional partners for 54
years. But they never expected to actually enter the inner sanctum
of the opera house.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, however, David Kneuss, the executive stage director
at the Metropolitan Opera, approached them with an operatic idea
that seemed right for them. The result can be seen Thursday night
when the Met presents ``Die Fledermaus,'' the popular operetta by
Johann Strauss, with a new book and spoken dialogue by Ms. Comden
and Green.
</P>
<P>
   There is precedent for musical theater people trying to make
Strauss' familiar operetta zippier and up to date. When the work
returned to the Met's repertory in 1950, after an absence of four
decades, the production was directed by the screenwriter and
playwright Garson Kanin, with irreverent new dialogue by the
Broadway lyricist Howard Dietz.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the problems in preparing new dialogue for this 1874
operetta are built in, as Ms. Comden and Green have found out.
``The dialogue has to fit Strauss' score,'' Green said. ``It's very
difficult. We had to find a way to get in and out of every aria and
ensemble, and keep it consistent with the existing music.''
</P>
<P>
   The original version of the opera, with lyrics and spoken
dialogue by Carl Haffner and Richard Genee, was based on a French
comedy by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halevy, the librettists of
``Carmen.'' The humor in the original is cynical. Set in the Belle
Epoque years of Vienna, the story takes place on one long,
inebriated night.
</P>
<P>
   When it begins, Rosalinde, the young wife of Gabriel von
Eisenstein, a well-to-do Viennese citizen, is being serenaded
outside her window by a former lover, a tenor, Alfred. The song
comes at a dangerous time, for Rosalinde has a weak spot for
tenors, and her husband is about to report to prison to serve five
days for assaulting a police officer. Eisenstein bursts into the
room, furious that his incompetent lawyer, named Blind, has somehow
managed to get his sentence increased to eight days.
</P>
<P>
   But Eisenstein's friend, Dr. Falke, shows up with a plan. Prince
Orlofsky, a bored, wealthy Russian eccentric, is throwing a masked
ball, and Falke wants his friend Eisenstein to have one last fling,
without his wife, at the prince's party. Dr. Falke is getting even
for being the butt of a practical joke: Eisenstein, Rosalinde and
Adele, their maid, are being manipulated by Falke to appear at the
ball, where infidelities will be revealed and scores settled.
</P>
<P>
   In their new book, Ms. Comden and Green have the Dr. Falke
character call the little domestic comedy he is arranging ``She
Knew but He Didn't Know She Knew That He Didn't Know That She
Knew,'' which is a pretty good summation of the entire plot.
</P>
<P>
   The operetta was an immediate success at its 1874 premiere, and
from the start a tradition developed, sanctioned by Strauss, of
allowing some tomfoolery into the show. During the prince's ball,
surprise guests usually show up to entertain the revelers. In
Strauss' day, the guests were usually singers performing songs from
other Strauss works.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years at the Met, Prince Orlofsky's guests have been
entertained by Enrico Caruso offering Neapolitan songs, Birgit
Nilsson singing ``I Could Have Danced All Night'' and, in 1994, the
soprano Harolyn Blackwell doing a mock striptease. The other scene
where broad comedy has been encouraged involves the drunken jailer
Frosch, a nonsinging role that has been a vehicle for Victor Borge,
Sid Caesar, Jack Gilford, Dom DeLuise and others.
</P>
<P>
   But with the fun has come a problem: Audiences now expect
Strauss' wry operetta to be a gagfest, and this has led to
inclusion of lame humor and dumb sight gags. So the task faced by
Ms. Comden and Green, as they explained, was to spice up the
dialogue without resorting to bawdy jokes and topical humor.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest chance they took, Green said, was changing Dr. Falke
into Sigmund Freud. But since they have shifted the date of the
story, as a nod to the millennium, to New Year's Eve of 1899, they
felt it made sense. In another change, Eisenstein is made a
newspaper editor who is going to prison for punching a music critic
who dared to write negatively of his wife, Rosalinde, in this
version an opera singer.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the jailer Frosch's drunken scene has been eliminated.
``Drunk scenes are done to death,'' Ms. Comden said. ``We rewrote
the character, made him an out-of-work actor and introduced him in
Act II.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a staggering drunk routine, Frosch entertains his
prisoners with a one-man play called ``The Bell Ringer of Notre
Dame,'' which turns out to be a setup for a series of intentionally
bad puns: lowbrow comedy in the tried-and-true theater tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss' operetta will be performed in the original German (with
title translations available), but the new dialogue will be spoken
in English.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in many years, these veteran show people will
hear a work of theirs performed without any amplification.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, audiences worked harder,'' Ms. Comden said.
``They leaned forward and paid attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Green added, ``Now they expect to be spoon fed.''
</P>
<P>
   They seem happy with the cast, which includes Carol Vaness as
Rosalinde; the Danish baritone Bo Skovhus in his Met debut as
Eisenstein, and the American conductor Patrick Summers, also in his
Met debut.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Ms. Comden and Green have worked in an opera house,
they are willing to try it again. After all, Ms. Comden said,
``it's still the theater.''

ANGER RISES OVER PLANS FOR RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN ONTARIO
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Canadians live in a big country graced with an
abundance of unspoiled places. And many of them want to keep it
that way.
</P>
<P>
   That is why tempers have flared over a far-reaching attempt by
the province of Ontario to control what happens in a territory of
publicly owned woodlands the size of Sweden. The plan will
determine how much land should be preserved as parks and how much
would be open to logging, mining and other commercial uses.
</P>
<P>
   The draft plan so far is a balancing act that increases park
lands while providing more diverse opportunities for industry. But
neither side is satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem lies in the fact that for many people in
Toronto and other urban areas, the sparsely populated region above
the Great Lakes represents both the cherished Canadian ideal of a
wilderness frontier and a favored vacation area. In conversation
and weather forecasts it is called ``cottage country'' because so
many city dwellers own second homes there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty humble cottage country,'' said Nancy Jack, an
environmental lawyer at the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources
who lives in Toronto but owns a small house on a lake about two and
a half hours north of the city. She opposes the broad opening of
land to commercial interests, especially near her getaway. ``The
area was badly logged 100 years ago and now has recovered somewhat
to poor quality forest. But we love it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the dispute are the logging and mining
industries that see any attempt to restrict commercial activity as
a threat to jobs and a way of life favored by many of the 800,000
full-time residents of the area, which covers roughly half the
province.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southern Ontario is very heavily developed. Everything's been
paved over for suburbia and shopping malls,'' said C. David Comba,
director of issues management for the Prospectors and Developers
Association of Canada, which represents mining interests in
Ontario. ``Southerners have essentially ruined their own
environment and now they think they can assuage their conscience by
creating parks and telling people in the north that they have to
accept a lower standard of living.''
</P>
<P>
   About 83 percent of the land in the province is publicly owned,
and environmentalists had hoped that the current planning process
would have increased the amount of protected land substantially.
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative government, led by Premier Mike Harris, does
plan to increase the percentage of public land set aside for parks
and conservation in the Lands for Life area to about 9.5 percent of
the total, up from 7.9 percent. But creating jobs is an even higher
priority and the government wants to substantially enhance mining
and logging opportunities while also protecting tourism, hunting
and fishing interests.
</P>
<P>
   Logging and mining are two of the most important industries in
Ontario, directly employing more than 80,000 people, according to
industry figures. Tim Gray, head of the Wildlands League, an
environmental group, said that under the proposed plan, Ontario
will end up ceding nearly all control over the land to private
logging and mining companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this government is proposing is the most fundamental
change in land use and public management of the land since
confederation,'' Grey said, referring to the formation of Canada as
a separate country in 1867.
</P>
<P>
   But John Snobelen, minister of natural resources, called such
charges ``nonsense.'' He said the recommendations now being
considered contain no provision that ``would give that kind of
control,'' but simply continue the renewable licenses now widely
used for such contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The Ontario government has spent more than a year discussing the
development plan. It has received more than 14,000 public comments
from people, including Elizabeth R. Tanner, the reeve, or mayor, of
Burleigh-Anstruther-Chandos Township, in cottage country near
Peterborough.
</P>
<P>
   The rural municipality forwarded a recommendation to the
province to designate the area a conservation zone, where logging
and mining would be prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the draft proposal, the township is considered
an enhanced management area, which allows seasonal residents,
snowmobiles and hunting, along with logging and mining. ``What it
actually means,'' a dissatisfied Tanner said, ``is status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   Snobelen said he plans to issue a report by the end of January
giving the final draft of the northern lands plan. No legislation
is needed for the plan to be adopted.

 &HT;    Cold weather arrives in Central Texas
 &HT;    By Jason Spencer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Consider Tuesday's sub-freezing temperatures and
steady 20 mph winds a warmup of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   Weather forecasters predict that even lower thermometer readings
coupled with freezing rain this morning could turn Central Texas'
roads into an icy ballet of twirling commuters. And the threat of
nasty driving conditions could stick around, because temperatures
are expected to stay below freezingthrough Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be pretty ugly if you don't like ice,'' said Jeff House,
a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., a private weather service in
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters, however, are uncertain whether that rain will stay
frozen after it hits the ground. Residual heat from the warm
temperatures that preceded the arctic cold front that rolled
through the area Monday may keep ice from accumulating on local
roads, House said.
</P>
<P>
   State highway crews on Monday began covering well traveled
overpasses and bridges with chemicals that should prevent ice
sheets from developing, said John Hurt, spokesman for the Texas
Department of Transportation's Austin District, which includes the
11-county area surrounding the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think ... the next 24 to 48 hours will probably be the
diciest,'' Hurt said Tuesday. ``We certainly don't want to be
working Christmas Day, but we will if we have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Williamson County Road and Bridge Department crews loaded trucks
with sand Tuesday to brace for icy conditions, said Greg Bergeron,
road superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Although Tuesday's temperature in Austin bottomed out at 28
degrees, that number should drop to 23 degrees this morning and
remain at or below freezing through Thursday, House said. For
Christmas Day, WeatherData meteorologists expect thermometers to
peak at the 36-degree mark.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters with the National Weather Service, however, believe
the frigid weather should be gone Friday, with Austin possibly
warming to a toasty 50 degrees, said David Schumacher, a weather
service forecaster stationed in New Braunfels.
</P>
<P>
   Central Texas wasn't the only place affected by the first big
cold wave of the season. The first day of winter saw frost warnings
for Southern California citrus growers and a foot of new snow in
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The arctic air flooded out of Canada and into the northern
Rockies and Plains over the weekend. Montana got the worst of it,
with a low of 39 below zero Monday in Butte and 45 below at West
Yellowstone.
</P>
<P>
   Butte's low Tuesday was almost mild by contrast at 18 below, as
the nation's cold spot shifted southward to Craig, Colo., where the
low was minus 31.
</P>
<P>
   The weather should not affect air traffic at Austin's Robert
Mueller Municipal Airport, said Al Gallardo, airport operations
chief. ``We go through this every year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   City utility workers were put on stand-by Tuesday in case
weather conditions disrupt electrical service. ``At a moment's
notice, we can roll a dozen crews instantly,'' said Ed Clark,
spokesman for Austin Energy.
</P>
<P>
   The cold weather also has created plenty of work for Austin's
Salvation Army center, which housed 440 homeless people Monday
night and expected at least that number again Tuesday night.
Because the shelter is built to hold 310 people, many slept on
mats, said Major Robert Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, at 501 E. 8th St., still needs blankets and food
donations to get through the week, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shelters also are open at St. George's Episcopal Church and
Trinity United Methodist Church, said Gene Golden, a client service
specialist with the Austin Resource Center for the Homeless. The
organization, located at 411 W. 2nd St., needs adult coats and
socks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the prolonged freezing weather does have its benefits,
said Ronnie Leps,Williamson County extension agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some good things that come out of cold weather,'' he
said. ``Last year, we had some plants that should have been killed
by the cold weather thatstayed green all the way through. ...
That's not normal or typical for the area that we live in and
that's not good.''
</P>
<P>
   The freeze also should put a dent in next spring's insect
population, Leps said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason we weren't overrun by fire ants last summer
was because it was very hot and dry,'' he said. ``We need seasons
and those seasons are here for a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Some area merchants also cashed in on the cold weather.
</P>
<P>
   Business has been steady at P&AMP;R Butane in Liberty Hill ever
since Monday, when people found out the low temperatures were
coming, said Mary Parker, who dispatches butane trucks to
customers' homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually we work eight to five,'' she said. ``Last night one of
our boys was out until after nine.''
</P>
<P>
   Cash registers at Burlington Coat Factory on Middle Fiskville
Road have stayed warm all week, according to store manager Patricia
Leal. ``All our coats, gloves, scarves _ anything to do with
accessories for a coat are moving very well,'' she said.

JUDGE PUTS TIGHTER RESTRICTIONS ON INDICTED CLINTON FRIEND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark.)  (mk) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A U.S. judge on Tuesday placed tighter restrictions
on the movements of Yah Lin Trie, an Arkansas restaurateur who has
been indicted on campaign fund-raising charges, after it was
learned that Trie had applied for a Taiwanese passport.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Paul Friedman of U.S. District Court ordered that Trie,
also known as Charlie, report twice a week in person to a court
officer in Norfolk, Va., and that until his trial date he be
subject to a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. The curfew will be enforced
by random calls to the home in Virginia Beach, Va., where he is
living with his sister.
</P>
<P>
   Trie, a Taiwanese-born naturalized citizen and a longtime friend
of President Clinton, was indicted in November on a charge of
obstructing a Senate investigation into accusations of campaign
fund-raising abuses during the president's 1996 re-election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Trie left the United States in late 1996 rather than testify
before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, but returned
voluntarily last February and pleaded not guilty to federal
campaign finance charges.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his return, Trie had surrendered his American and
Taiwanese passports. But in December, without telling the Justice
Department, the court or his own lawyers, he applied for a new
Taiwanese passport, telling officials in Taiwan that his was lost.
</P>
<P>
   An assistant U.S. attorney, Geoffrey Hobart, said this could
have been a step in preparation for fleeing the country, and he
urged Friedman to revoke Trie's bail.
</P>
<P>
   Trie's lawyer, Reid Weingarten, said that since his client's
return from Taiwan in February, Trie had scrupulously adhered to
the conditions of his bail, even traveling back and forth without
incident to Taiwan twice to visit his ailing wife, who subsequently
died.
</P>
<P>
   ``His actions are not indicative of a man who is about to
flee,'' Weingarten said. ``It's indicative of a man whose life has
been shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   In a court ruling involving another Democratic fund-raiser,
another federal judge here on Tuesday ordered John Huang, the
former Commerce Department official and fund-raiser, to give more
testimony in a four-year-old civil case brought by a conservative
public interest group that accuses the department of selling seats
on its trade missions in exchange for donations to the Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
   The department has denied the accusations, which were made by
Judicial Watch Inc. as part of a lawsuit it filed seeking documents
from the department under the Freedom of Information Act.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Judge Royce Lamberth of U.S. District Court found
that the department had engaged in a pattern of misconduct,
including the ``destruction of potentially responsive documents''
in the office of the late Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown ``and
elsewhere,'' the ``illegal withholding of responsive documents in
the removal of such documents from'' the Commerce Department, and
``a great deal of misconduct during the litigation, which the court
leaves for another day's decision.'' Lamberth also scolded the
department for failing to investigate its own misconduct.

TVA PLANTS CHOSEN TO PRODUCE TRITIUM FOR NUCLEAR WARHEADS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.C., Tenn., Wash.)  (rl) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Facing a shortage of a crucial component of nuclear
warheads, the Energy Department announced today that it will use
three of the Tennessee Valley Authority's civilian reactors to make
the material, tritium.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson acknowledged Tuesday that the
arrangement with the TVA, which is subject to congressional
approval, breaks down a longtime distinction in the nuclear world
by using a civilian reactor for military purposes.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, lining up the TVA's reactors encouraged
nuclear nonproliferation because it eliminated the need for the
United States to break ground on an expensive new military plant.
Such a plant to produce tritium might be far larger than ever
needed, if new arms control agreements are signed.
</P>
<P>
   The department's last reactor for making tritium was shut down
for safety reasons 10 years ago. For the past 10 years, weapons
decommissioned under arms accords have been the military's source
of tritium, and until now, the pace of weapons retirements has been
faster than the pace of tritium decay. But unless Russia approves a
new arms control agreement soon, the United States will need new
tritium in six years to sustain its arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said the Energy Department had used provisions of a
60-year-old law, the Economy Act, to require the TVA to sell
tritium at cost. Department officials said that if they had not
been able to strike a deal, they would have asked the Navy
requisition the reactors under national security provisions.
</P>
<P>
   In a test that began 15 months ago, the Energy Department is
already making tritium at Watts Bar, near Knoxville, Tenn.
Technicians loaded metal rods into the reactor containing an
isotope of lithium metal; when these are struck by the neutrons
that sustain the chain reaction, the lithium breaks up into tritium
and helium. In February 1999, when the plant shuts for refueling,
technicians will remove the rods to extract the tritium.
</P>
<P>
   The rods take the place of neutron-absorber rods that are used
to control the reaction. They do not reduce power output, engineers
say, and they expect to persuade the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
quickly that they pose no additional risk.
</P>
<P>
   The TVA had asked for $85 million a year to make tritium at
three of its reactors. Richardson did not say Tuesday what the cost
would be. But he said using the reactors, Watts Bar 1 and Sequoyah
1 and 2, near Chattanooga, is ``the best option for our national
security.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a proven technology, it is the best deal by far for the
taxpayer, and it has the flexibility to meet our present and future
tritium needs,'' he said. If he had chosen a dedicated military
plant, or a linear accelerator, construction would have had to
begin soon, he said. By relying on reactors already built, the work
would be done only as needed. ``We may not need to exercise this
option for many years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The department says it needs about 5.5 pounds of tritium a year
to maintain the current arsenal, beginning in 2005, and 3.3 pounds
if the strategic arms reduction talks, or Start 2, agreement is
approved, beginning in 2011.
</P>
<P>
   The decision drew mixed reactions. Some arms proliferation
specialists said it would undermine the U.S. position in asking
other countries not to divert material from their civilian nuclear
programs into bombs. The Energy Department contends, though, that
unlike plutonium, which is made in reactors and is the heart of a
bomb, tritium is not controlled by law and cannot be used by itself
to make a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance for Nuclear Accountability, a coalition of 28
environmental and peace groups, mostly around Energy Department
weapons plants, said the decision is ``unnecessary, undermines
nonproliferation efforts, wastes taxpayer dollars, and threatens
public health.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Nuclear Control Institute, a Washington-based group
advocating nonproliferation, Paul Leventhal, the president, said
using existing reactors was ``the cheapest, most assured method of
producing tritium on an as-needed basis.'' But he said the use of
civilian reactors should be reserved for national emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress from South Carolina wanted Richardson to
build a linear accelerator at Savannah River, and some officials
near Hanford, the nuclear reservation in central Washington state,
wanted Richardson to use the Fast Flux Test Facility, a plutonium
reactor there. Richardson said Tuesday that he would decide next
year whether to permanently shut that plant, which began life as
part of a research program for plants that would make plutonium.
</P>
<P>
   But Richardson also announced Tuesday that the department will
build a plant at Savannah River, near Aiken, S.C., for converting
plutonium from warheads into a powder, an intermediate step toward
destroying the plutonium.
</P>
<P>
   The TVA was also disappointed. It wanted to supply the
department with tritium in exchange for a payment of $2.3 billion,
which it would have used to complete its Bellefonte reactor in
northern Alabama. It stopped work on the reactor in 1988 because of
cost overruns and slack demand for power.

   STOCKS MIXED, BUT PRICES OF BONDS FALL SHARPLY
</P>
<P>
   Stocks were mixed in fairly light trading, but Treasury prices
posted their biggest decline in six weeks, pushed down by a flow of
money from bonds to stocks and a selloff of Japanese bonds. The
yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury rose to 5.13 percent. The
Dow Jones industrials rose 55.61 points, or six-tenths of a
percent, to 9,044.46, and the S&AMP;P 500 edged up 0.73 point, to
1,203.57, eclipsing a record set on Monday. But profit-taking in
technology stocks dragged down the Nasdaq index by 17.05 points, or
eight-tenths of 1 percent, to 2,120.98.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, the No.1 online service, will replace Venator
Group in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index effective after the
close of trading on Dec. 31.

   CIGNA MAY SELL UNIT FOR $3 BILLION
</P>
<P>
   Cigna, a leading health insurer, is in talks to sell its
commercial insurance business to Ace Ltd., a fast-growing Bermuda
insurance company, for $3 billion or more, the companies said.
Analysts said such a sale would enable Cigna to focus on its core
business and would vastly increase the size and geographic reach of
Ace. Shares of both companies rose after they confirmed the talks.
Ace advanced $1.38, to $28.95. Cigna rose $1.50, to $79.13.

<P>
   ICAHN CALLS FOR SPINOFF OF NABISCO
</P>
<P>
   The financier Carl Icahn has raised his stake in RJR Nabisco
Holdings to 5.6 percent and renewed his call for the No.2 U.S.
tobacco company to spin off its Nabisco cookie and cracker
business. Shares of RJR, which have fallen 20 percent over the last
year, rose $1.75, or 6.2 percent, to $30.
</P>
<P>
   Paul E. Cohen, the president of Stratosphere Entertainment, an
independent film company he founded with Icahn, announced that he
had resigned.

   EUROPEAN BANK SIGNALS NO RATE CUT
</P>
<P>
   At its last meeting before 11 nations adopt a single currency,
the European Central Bank indicated that there would be no
immediate cuts in interest rates when the euro is introduced on
Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   European Union officials met to figure out how to spread the new
single currency into Europe's nooks and crannies.

   INQUIRY INTO FRITO-LAY IS CLOSED
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has closed its investigation into the

finding of wrongdoing. The Government had been looking into
possible anti-competitive practices in the salty-snack industry for
two years.

   JAPANESE BANK DEFENDS STRENGTH
</P>
<P>
   Fending off weeks of criticism that the Japanese central bank's
financial strength is eroding, the governor of the Bank of Japan
said that it had one of the world's safest pools of assets, second
only to that of the United States Federal Reserve.
</P>

   DEBT DOWNGRADE FOR TOSHIBA
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's lowered its long-term credit ratings on
Toshiba's debt, saying efforts by the Japanese electronics company
to strengthen itself financially will likely be hurt by a swift
erosion in cash flow and adverse global market conditions. The
downgrade was sobering because the company is regarded as having
gone further to overhaul itself than have most large corporations
in Japan.

COMMENTARY: SEND OUT THE CLOWNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was a good night to feel sorry for Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The impeached president was throwing a big Christmas party for
his tormentors in the press. It seemed too much to ask, after the
December he has endured, that he should have to entertain the
people who have brought to the world's attention all his flaws and
felonious behavior. A White House party in this season of peace,
good will and impeachment seemed too strange to miss.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday The Times printed the recollections of Mark Twain, who
went, as a 32-year-old journalist, to a reception at Andrew
Johnson's White House on the eve of that president's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I confess I went out of a thoughtless curiosity to see how the
Chief Magistrate bore himself under these untoward circumstances,''
Twain wrote. ``I never saw a man who seemed as friendless and
forsaken.''
</P>
<P>
   Still thoughtlessly curious 130 years later, 6,000 journalists
piled into a long line at the White House gate on Monday night.
Once in a while a clown _ I mean, a real clown _ pranced by.
Waiting, I mused how odd it was that a president who seemed so
cuddly and eager to please had ended up creating so much chaos.
</P>
<P>
   There is something about him _ maybe the feeling that he's
always getting away with something _ that drives people crazy. In
Washington, we refer to this polarizing effect as ``Clinton
poisoning.'' He drove Ken Starr crazy. He drove the Republicans
crazy. He drove pundits crazy. He drove his staff crazy. He drove
the country crazy; even if you don't want Clinton impeached, it
doesn't make sense for him to have such celestial approval ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside, we were greeted by the saturnine portrait of Andrew
Johnson, and two rooms down there was Andrew Jackson, the only
president to be censured. After another hour of standing in line to
stand in another line, we finally reached a huddled mass of
humanity waiting on the South Lawn to jam itself into an overheated
tent. Inside there were only more clowns and wilted cookies.
</P>
<P>
   I waited in still another line, trying to snag an eggnog while a
singer on stage warbled badly about putting on ``your bright red
jammies.'' I couldn't help but dream of the giant buffet tables of
White House Christmases past, those platters heaped with shrimp and
succulent lamb chops, and agree with my friends that this party was
the Clintons' revenge on us.
</P>
<P>
   Feet aching and deprived of sustenance, I thought about all the
other things that have gone crazy this year.
</P>
<P>
   Feminism is ruined. That was clear once again when that
self-styled feminist iconette, Geraldine Ferraro, pitched in to
help the president on the impeachment vote by lobbying Republican
women in the House. Calling Tillie Fowler of Florida, Ms. Ferraro
made her pitch: ``Tillie, a man is a man is a man.'' And when the
matriarch of feminism, Betty Friedan, lobbied for the president by
saying, ``Even if he did what he is alleged to have done, what's
the big deal?''
</P>
<P>
   Journalism is ruined. Now Larry Flynt, Matt Drudge and Salon are
running the show, dishing the dirt, while the rest of us try to
figure out where that slippery little line between private and
public is.
</P>
<P>
   Sex scandals are ruined. Like ``The Blue Room,'' the Oval Office
was all about sex without being sexy. If only David Hare could be
impeached, and Bill Clinton could get bad reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Socializing is ruined. Nobody can go to dinner here anymore
without getting into a screaming match over Bill Clinton's sex
life.
</P>
<P>
   Contrition is ruined. The Clinton confessions lose in
authenticity as they gain in frequency. The only thing he's really
sorry about is that he got caught. And then, the minute things
start to go well for him, he becomes overconfident and slips up. At
a White House party for supporters on Sunday, he once again
compared himself to Nelson Mandela, telling an L.A. Times reporter
that the South African hero had advised him not to give his heart
and mind to his adversaries. If he means that he should not become
vindictive, then the lesson is the right one. If he means that he
can paint himself as a political martyr, then here we go again.
</P>
<P>
   I fled the stuffy tent without laying eyes on the president to
see if he looked ``friendless and forsaken.'' But I still felt
sorry for the guy. He must drive himself crazy too. (BOX)

 &HT;    Texas Board of Pardons &AMP; Paroles reviews clemency process
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In a first-ever glimpse into how Texas considers
clemency for its condemned criminals, members of the Texas Board of
Pardons and Paroles detailed for an Austin federal court Tuesday
how they routinely decide that most everyone should die.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Sandie Walker said she ``can't get away from the
crime they committed.'' And while Paul Prejean considers the job of
deciding clemency cases a ``very emotional . . . gut wrenching . .
. an awesome responsibility,'' he could not explain how he arrives
at his decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Tauss said she generally looks at guilt or innocence,
two things courts already have ruled upon. For John Escobedo, who
has never voted for clemency in nearly nine years on the board, it
just means voting no over and over.
</P>
<P>
   ``How I decide is difficult to explain,'' explained board member
Daniel Ray Lang, who has only voted once for clemency in three
years. ``It's like justice and mercy. I can't really define it, but
I'll know it when I see it.''
</P>
<P>
   The unusual hearing was sparked by legal challenges raised by
Joseph Stanley Faulder and Danny Lee Barber, both convicted killers
facing execution, who persuaded U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks
three weeks ago to block their dates with Texas' lethal needle by
raising questions about whether Texas' secret clemency system is
legal or fair.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony Tuesday, board members defended the system _ which
operates without written criteria for reviewing or deciding
clemency cases, and without public hearings or public votes on each
case. Most other states require such procedures be followed.
</P>
<P>
   One by one Tuesday, 10 members of the 18-member public board
that is Texas' last hope for execution-bound convicts tried to
explain the secretive system by which they make decisions _ a
system in which, testimony showed, the thousands of public pleas
filed in are never forwarded to the board, in which letters from
convicts' family and friends are not considered, in which some of
the few written rules are oftentimes not followed.
</P>
<P>
   It is a process in which some board members vote against
clemency after spending less than a day, perhaps just a few hours,
reviewing hundreds of pages of documents related to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the case of convicted serial killer Henry Lee Lucas, who
last summer became the first death row convict approved for
clemency in years, board members were unable Tuesday to give
specifics for their decision to reduce his sentence to a life term.
</P>
<P>
   ``In cases of innocence, it's a fail-safe. In all other cases,
it's about mercy. In Texas, it's neither,'' Rita Radostitz, an
attorney for death row convict Danny Lee Barber, said at the end of
Tuesday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks, who now must decide whether Texas' secretive clemency
system meets legal muster, appeared almost as exasperated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though this board represents the public, there is nothing
_ absolutely no way the public, even the governor, can know the
reason for their vote without asking each of them,'' Sparks said.
``And I find that appalling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I find the state so silly in this secretive process,'' he
said. ``They've got to have a reason for why they vote, but no
record is made of it . . . It is incredible to me that on an
18-member board, that no one has ever seen fit to ask for a hearing
_ even so much as a telephone conference call _ on any of 76 cases.
I find that to be very troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, state officials argued Texas' system is both legal and
fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a strength of the system in the way that it
operates,'' Assistant Attorney General Dewey Helmcamp told Sparks.
Even so, he suggested that changes may be forthcoming to resolve
the lingering questions. ``But in our view, the process works and
(Faulder and Barber) received full and fair consideration of their
requests for clemency.''
</P>
<P>
   While they insisted they should not be required to hold hearings
in death-penalty clemency cases, fearing convicts might use them to
re-try a case or to jockey for further court delays, most board
members said they would have no problem with providing a written
reason for their votes.
</P>
<P>
   Board Chairman Victor Rodriguez, though, said no procedural
changes are planned.
</P>
<P>
   As proof of the board's bent to rubber-stamp executions,
Radostitz noted that while the parole board opposes public hearings
in death-row clemency cases, it routinely holds hearings on parole
revocations of convicts facing lesser sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board is hiding behind this cloak of secrecy,'' said
Sandra Babcock, Faulder's attorney. ``They are pretending that
inmates are receiving meaningful considerations of clemency when
they are not. The reason people are entitled to more is because the
U.S. Constitution requires it.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the testimony, these (board members) apparently don't
have much mercy in their hearts,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Ward writes for the Austin American-Statesman, Austin,
Texas.

MOUNT RAINIER AS MUSE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 
 
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Mount Rainier's snowy peak lends its spectacular
beauty to Seattle but also adds a touch of Northwest noir to the
landscape. She is, after all, a volcano. Rainier has such a
presence that when the city's famous clouds lift, people offer this
simple report to one another: ``The mountain is out.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus it is not surprising that the awesome mountain also has
loomed large in the artistic consciousness, so much so that a group
of students and teachers at the University of Washington once
declared that an art student ``should not graduate from the
university without dealing with the image of Mount Rainier in some
way.'' But while everyone sees Rainier, many artists clearly find
it far from easy to take their own measure of this familiar icon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so massive and reverence-inspiring that at first I
thought it was part of the clouds and that it wasn't a real
mountain,'' said Joel A. Lee, one of the artists whose work is on
display here.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's acrylic on poplar wood is one of the works in ``The View
From Here: 100 Artists Mark the Centennial of Mount Rainier
National Park,'' a show at the Seafirst Gallery in the public
atrium of the Columbia Seafirst Center, Seattle's tallest building.
Some of the pieces evoke the mountain's majesty, some are
whimsical, while others explore its potential for destruction.
</P>
<P>
   They include everything from a 19th-century oil painting to a
sculpture carved from Rainier's glacial ice (to be diligently
returned after the show is over, since nothing is supposed to be
taken permanently from a national park).
</P>
<P>
   A few of the artists know the mountain from having climbed to
its 14,410-foot summit. One, Chet Edward Hanson, a photographer,
went for a hike on Rainier's Angel Trail 13 months ago and
disappeared; his body has never been found. Others only know it, as
most people here do, as a powerful landmark in the distance. Two of
the artists, creators of photographs from early this century, are
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The show and its title would seem to have been inspired by
Hokusai's famous ``100 Views of Mount Fuji,'' the woodblock print
masterpieces that the Japanese artist created more than a century
and a half ago. It is to travel, in between its display here and
elsewhere in Washington State, to Japan to help celebrate the
establishment of an official ``sister mountain'' relationship
between Fuji and Rainier. That designation was agreed to by the
national park services of both nations.
</P>
<P>
   But in reality the idea for the exhibition had much more prosaic
origins, concedes Peggy Weiss, the show's curator and the director
of the Seafirst Gallery, a nonprofit arm of the Bank of America.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago she was struck by a photograph by Alan Berner
titled ``Supermall,'' which depicts the opening of a shopping mall
near here. A group of businessmen is seen celebrating the event;
the mall's entrance is adorned with a kitschy cutout image of
Rainier, fireworks blazing from the volcano's peak, one of
thousands of ways that Rainier is used commercially. ``It just got
me thinking about all the ways that Rainier gets depicted,'' said
Ms. Weiss, who found the photograph both amusing and provocative
and included it in the show. She also has solicited music and
poetry. ``The point here is to get not just the beauty shot of
Rainier, but the unique view that artists have on this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There are 100 unique views in the show, which will continue
until Jan. 15 at the Seafirst Gallery, before part of it will be on
display at the Seattle-Tacoma airport. While there are plenty of
beauty shots, including Sanford Gifford's 1874 ``Mount Rainier,'' a
landscape that Ms. Weiss borrowed from the Seafirst Bank chairman's
office, many other pieces are wildly fanciful or spring from
fascination with the mountain's darker side.
</P>
<P>
   In Andrew Keating's ``Mount Rainier Mona Lisa,'' a 1974 sketch,
Rainier is an ornamental hat on a woman's head.
</P>
<P>
   For a work titled ``Out of Sight, Out of Mind,'' Lou Cabeen, an
art professor at the University of Washington, assembled 100
postcards of Mount Rainier, the sort of tourist shots taken at
sunset on clear summer days. But most of the year here, the weather
interferes with views of Rainier. So Ms. Cabeen humorously posted
circular white stickers, with words like ``rain,'' ``clouds,''
``fog'' and ``haze'' over the summit in 70 of the 100 postcards.
</P>
<P>
   The dark side is explored in a 1980 cut-wood assemblage by Bill
Whipple titled ``Mount Rainier's Revenge.'' In one panel, dozens of
Seattle icons _ Boeing jets, the Space Needle, the Kingdome,
skyscrapers, fish, trees _ fit snugly inside the mountain. In the
next, the mountain explodes, blasting everything skyward.
</P>
<P>
   Whipple finished his work two days before Rainier's downstate
neighbor, Mount St. Helen's, began rumblings leading to a
full-scale eruption.

ENERGY DEPT. PICKS TENNESSEE OVER HANFORD TO PRODUCE TRITIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson decided Tuesday to keep
Washington state's Hanford Nuclear Reservation out of the bomb
business and to select sites outside the state to produce
radioactive material used to boost atomic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department instead will use commercial nuclear
reactors in Tennessee to produce tritium, a radioactive isotope of
hydrogen. Tritium decays rapidly, forcing the U.S. government to
find a new source for the isotope by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial reactors offer the cheapest and most flexible
solution, Richardson said at news conference in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Deparment officials still hold out the possibility that
Hanford's Fast Flux Test Facility, which backers hoped would be
restarted to begin making tritium, might be put into production for
other uses.
</P>
<P>
   The fast flux reactor, built and operated from 1983 to 1992 for
research and development purposes, has been in standby mode since
1993. Supporters had argued that using it for tritium production
would have meant more jobs and a new humanitarian mission for the
nation's bomb factory.
</P>
<P>
   An Energy Department task force will report to Richardson by
April on possible missions for the reactor, after which he will
decide whether it should be used for civilian purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of using the Hanford reactor said attention must now
be focused on finding peacetime uses for the facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I'm disappointed by Secretary Richardson's decision, we
must now move forward to identify other possible uses for the
facility,'' said U.S. Rep. Doc Hastings, the Eastern Washington
Republican whose district includes Hanford.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Gov. Gary Locke also expressed disappointment and
said it remains to be seen whether the reactor will be used.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of starting the fast flux reactor said Richardson's
decision should mean that the facility be closed once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that rescued it from a shutdown was the
possibility of tritium production,'' said Bruce Hall of Peace
Action, a national disarmament group. ``Now that the tritium issue
is resolved, there is no reason for it. It should be shut down.''
</P>
<P>
   The move to use commercial nuclear reactors owned by the
Tennessee Valley Authority to produce tritium to enhance atomic
weapons is a marked departure for U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Carter administration, the United States has opposed
using commercial reactors to produce weapons material and has tried
to persuade the rest of the world to follow its lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Richardson said the TVA is a government organization whose
charter includes supporting national security. He also said the TVA
plants could be open to international inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson selected the TVA's Watts Bar plant near Knoxville as
the primary producer of tritium and called it the cheapest option.
The TVA's Sequoyah plant near Chattanooga will be used as a backup.
</P>
<P>
   Both plants already produce electricity. The TVA is a federal
corporation and will be able to provide tritium at cost, Richardson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Hanford, building an accelerator at South Carolina's
Savannah River plant was under consideration. It would have cost $2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The TVA wanted Richardson to select one its nuclear plants under
construction in Alabama for tritium production, which would have
allowed the government to help pay for construction.
</P>
<P>
   Starting up the fast flux reactor at Hanford would cost an
estimated $371 million and running it would cost $120 million a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Using TVA's nuclear power plants will give the Energy Department
needed flexibility since arms-control agreements could change the
nation's need for tritium, which has not been produced in the
United States since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``This allows us to produce tritium when we need it,''
Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   He said using the fast flux Hanford reactor raises concerns
about violating agreements on nuclear non-proliferation. He didn't
elaborate at the news conference, which reporters monitored around
the country via telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Washington state's political leadership pushed for
using the fast flux at Hanford to produce tritium. Radioactive
isotopes created at the facility also could be used for medical
research and to treat certain cancers.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents, including environmental and peace groups, said
the move would have been a broken promise at Hanford, where weapons
production ended in 1989 and the government pledged to clean up one
of the worst-polluted sites on earth. They said resumption of
weapons production would simply produce more waste.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., expressed disappointment at
Richardson's decision and the ``missed opportunities of allowing
the FFTF (fast flux reactor) to provide the nation with new medical
breakthroughs and cancer therapies through medical isotopes.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that an evaluation of the reactor's merits will
lead to an environmental-impact study.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash and another supporter, said she hopes
the Energy Department will make production of medical isotopes.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents were pleased with Richardson's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Heart of America Northwest, a Hanford watchdog group, saw it as
a ``commitment to move forward with the desperately needed cleanup
at the Hanford site,'' spokeswoman Paige Leven said.

AMERICAN BASKETBALL LEAGUE, UNABLE MATCH POWER OF THE NBA, FOLDS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   They snuck in and nabbed the majority of gold-medal players
fresh off the 1996 Olympic podium and handed out six-figure
salaries for their stars. They savored the coup of being the first
to capitalize on women's basketball as it hit the pop chart and
defied gravity by launching a dunk contest.
</P>
<P>
   But for all their muscle and skill and daring, the American
Basketball League was marketed with Polaroids and magic markers
next to the glossy product the Women's National Basketball
Association put on as summertime family entertainment. The ABL
flailed for attention, corporate dollars and television deals until
its money ran out. Deep in debt, the ABL folded Tuesday one-third
of the way through its third season and announced that it will file
for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league is out of money,'' ABL co-founder Gary Cavalli said
in a statement. ``While this was an extremely painful decision, we
had no choice but to shut down. Ultimately, we exhausted every
option and pursued every lead, but could not generate the revenues
or financing necessary to sustain operations. And our lack of
television had a lot to do with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``TV exposure is critical to sponsors, licensees and investors.
This year, we offered millions of dollars to the TV networks for
air time, but couldn't obtain adequate coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became clear that, although we had the best product, we
could not find enough people willing to confront the NBA and give
us the major sponsorships and TV contracts we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA posed too ominous a mountain for the little engine
pushing the ABL. Now, the NBA-backed WNBA, which would never
entertain merging with the ABL, will likely capitalize from the
fall of the league. Although some players, including the star Dawn
Staley, recently defected to the WNBA, many argued that the best
players _ like Jen Rizzotti of the New England Blizzard _ were
still on the rosters of the ABL.
</P>
<P>
   Along with college players like Tennessee's Chamique Holdsclaw _
who has no American option but to play in the WNBA _ the elite ABL
players could end up lifting the level of the WNBA via free agency
or a draft pool although there was no clear answer on these issues
Tuesday. WNBA officials said it was too premature to determine what
will happen. And Cavalli, declining to comment on the advice of
legal counsel, was limited to his released statement and the
information provided on a telephone recording at the league's
headquarters in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   There were hints of problems in the ABL, with a franchise in
Long Beach, Calif., folding last month. But there was no
foreshadowing to indicate a league near doom. As the day unfolded,
shocked players listened to a recorded message telling them that
the league is working on a plan to pay players ``as much as
possible for the month of December.''
</P>
<P>
   Just Tuesday morning, the coach of the New England Blizzard,
K.C. Jones, was watching film in his office in Hartford around 2
p.m. when he received a call from the league's player personnel
director, Tracey Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call from Tracey saying that the league was closing
down,'' said Jones, whose Blizzard team road the coattails of
UConn's popularity and drew a league-high average crowd of 7,000
with fan favorites Rizzotti and Kara Wolters on the team. ``It was
a shocker.''
</P>
<P>
   Most believed the ABL had a chance to survive for another year,
but the league could not find a way to use the NBA's six-month old
lockout to its advantage. It was never viewed as an alternative to
the void left by the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the NBA lockout, the ABL still has been unable to buy
TV time,'' Cavalli stated.
</P>
<P>
   It was a grim way to end for the enthusiastic Cavalli. The ABL
came onto the scene as an unpolished but scrappy league that
intended to use its good timing to attract attention and find
momentum. A year earlier, the UConn women's basketball program,
complete with its wholesome appeal and loyal fans, helped catapult
the game onto the national landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the Olympics. With exposure courtesy of the NBA's
marketing machine, the women were thrust into the mainstream as
national darlings who captured audiences on their way to a
feel-good gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the ABL pounced on the game, sneaking onto the court
ahead of the NBA-backed WNBA. It was clear the NBA had nothing but
disdain for the ABL and thought of it as second-class rivals.
</P>
<P>
   But the WNBA never sweated the ABL's existence. While the
nine-team ABL was a winter league lost in the fray of college
basketball and saddled with an average attendance of 4,333 fans,
the WNBA was soaring in merchandise sales as an average of 10,869
people filled NBA arenas in the summer. While only spare television
coverage from Fox Sports Net and BET put the league into
households, the WNBA had deals with NBC, Lifetime and ESPN to
televise several games a week.
</P>
<P>
   The ABL did not have glamour as a lure for players, so it
reached deep _ perhaps too deep _ into its pockets to land talent
with high salaries. Last year, Kate Starbird, a star from Stanford,
opted for the ABL after Portland dangled a $150,000 salary in front
of her.
</P>
<P>
   Starbird and Wolters, also paid $150,000 a year, were the
top-paid players. Others faired well, too, tapping into the
league's disappearing well for an average salary of $80,000 for a
five-month season. Meanwhile, the WNBA could offer more endorsement
opportunities but only a $40,000 average for a shorter, six-week
season.
</P>
<P>
   More than cash, the WNBA had much more promise than the ABL from
the start. As much as the WNBA shoved the ABL aside _ and likely
pushed it toward a collapse with its hold on the market _ the
league was not publicly gloating Tuesday. It took a more diplomatic
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unfortunate setback for the women's sports
movement,'' WNBA commissioner Val Ackerman said in a statement.
``We applaud the efforts and passion of the ABL players and all the
league personnel that labored so hard to sustain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the ABL's basement-like operations were no match for
the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are proud of what we accomplished as a pioneer in women's
professional sports,'' Cavalli said. ``We put a great product on
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave it our best shot; we fought the good fight, and we had
a good run.''

SEATTLE SCHOOLS BAN LASER POINTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH TEICHROEB  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Penlike laser pointers, the latest high-tech fad among
teenagers, have been banned in Seattle schools following a rash of
complaints about pranksters aiming the red beams of light at human
targets.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Superintendent Joseph Olchefske said that both safety
concerns and students' disruptive behavior with laser pointers
prompted the district to ban the devices for students.
</P>
<P>
   ``These laser pens can be everything from a distraction to a
real danger,'' Olchefske said. ``We see them as a real problem and
want to get them out of the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   School districts around the country, from New York City to
Chicago, also have banned the hand-held laser pointers in the wake
of complaints from teachers, students and even school bus drivers,
who reported near-accidents after having the beam flashed in their
eyes on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo this month, the Seattle School District's legal
counsel advised principals to notify parents that possession and
use of laser pointers by students is prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   Students who aim laser pointers at another person could face
charges of disruptive conduct. If the device is deliberately shone
in someone's eyes, the offender could be charged with assault, the
memo warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told principals to look at the intent of how it's used,''
Olchefske said. ``If it's used as a malicious weapon, you have to
look at far more serious sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   Olchefske said he hadn't heard about any incidents where laser
pointers had been used as a weapon in Seattle schools.
</P>
<P>
   Warning labels on the product tell consumers not to shine the
devices in their eyes, retailers say.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say the beam will only cause damage if shone directly
into the eyes for about 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that if they are used properly, there's no
risk,'' said Dr. Robert Kalina, a opthamology professor at the
University of Washington. ``If you stared into it for more than 10
seconds, I think there would be some damage to the retina. But
you'd have to work at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people would instinctively blink and turn away from the
light before that, Kalina said. Still, there's no harm in being
cautious, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never underestimate what teenagers will do,'' Kalina said.
``There may be someone who would deliberately try something like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The most inexpensive laser pointers emit a low-intensity beam of
red light for about 100 yards and were originally designed to
highlight text during classroom or business presentations.
</P>
<P>
   As the gadgets became cheaper and smaller, their popularity with
teenagers took off. Stores sell laser pointers for $30 to $100,
said Dennis McCrae, Radio Shack's district sales manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very popular,'' he said. ``Most kids don't have $70 to
buy them, but their parents do because the kids want them.''
</P>
<P>
   At South Shore Middle School in South Seattle, Principal Bihoa
Caldwell said the main problem has been male students using the
pointers to highlight girls' breasts and other body parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the latest toy,'' she said. ``We've told students we'll
not only take them away, but if they're shining it in someone's
eyes, we'll treat it as an assault.''

 &HT;    Fugitive escapes across Mexican border
 &HT;    By Bob Banta
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A suspected murderer who was the target of an
extensive manhunt south of Austin escaped into Mexico on Tuesday,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   James Edward Tillis was being chased by U.S. Border Patrol
officers when he jumped into the Rio Grande at Laredo shortly after
8 a.m. and swam to safety on the Mexican side of the border river.
</P>
<P>
   Tillis, 30, is wanted for murder in West Helena, Ark., and for
rape and kidnapping in Tennessee, according to the Texas Department
of Public Safety.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas manhunt began about 1 p.m. Monday, when a DPS trooper
stopped to help Tillis, whose car was parked by the side of
Interstate 35 near Buda. Tillis told the trooper he had locked the
keys inside his car, according to DPS spokesman Mike Cox.
</P>
<P>
   During a routine license plate check, the officer learned of the
rape and murder warrants, but Tillis ran, taking cover in the rural
land west of the interstate.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Tillis made his way to the Manchaca community
near the Travis-Hays county line, where he threatened resident Paul
DeBarro, 64, with a shovel and made DeBarro give him his clothes.
Tillis then stole DeBarro's 1994 Ford pickup truck, investigators
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cox said the pickup was found alongside of I-35 about 2 a.m.
Tuesday about nine miles north of Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Border Patrol officers were alerted to a man attempting to
cross the border by a sensing device on Bridge No. 2 on the Texas
side of the Rio Grande, Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officers told him to stop, but he jumped into the Rio
Grande, swam about 75 yards downstream, came out of the water, and
disappeared into the brush on the Mexican side,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Cox said the Border Patrol officers identified Tillis as the man
they chased into the river from photos shown to them by DPS
officers. He said the officers' description of the clothes the
fugitive was wearing matched the clothes taken from in Manchaca.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Rangers will work with Mexican law enforcement officials
in an effort to catch Tillis, Cox said.

ANALYSIS: U.S. HAS NO PLAN FOR OUSTING SADDAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also IRAQ-FRANCE, IRAQ-SCENE) 
(sw) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of the major themes of American policy toward
Iraq has been the increasing sentiment in Congress and the White
House that Saddam Hussein should be overthrown. Yet there is deep
division between congressional Republicans and President Clinton
over how aggressively Washington should pursue that goal.
</P>
<P>
   So despite Clinton's insistent calls for a new government in
Bagdhad, little is now being done to achieve that objective.
Consequently, the United States does not have a specific plan
underway to overthrow Saddam, according to U.S. government
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision to launch a four-day bombing campaign against
Iraq was not coordinated with any new effort to mount a clandestine
coup against Saddam, and American officials acknowledge that
Congress has refused to permit the CIA to begin Clinton's covert
campaign to topple the Iraqi regime. Every covert action of this
sort requires a presidential finding, which is typically secret.
Then it must be authorized and funded by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has led to a prolonged stalemate between the Clinton
administration and Capitol Hill over the future role that the CIA
should play in Iraq policy.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say that the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
has blocked a CIA plan to subvert Saddam's government, because key
Republican lawmakers are not convinced that Clinton is serious
about overthrowing Saddam. In the middle of last week, Sen. Richard
Shelby, R-Ala., the committee's chairman, joined five other
Republican leaders in a letter to the president complaining of ``a
perceived drift in U.S. policy toward Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lack of leadership in the administration on this
issue,'' a congressional official said. ``How was the bombing
related to a strategy for an overthrow of Saddam? And what is the
administration doing to get us there? Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials counsel patience, saying there is no
quick fix available to overthrow the Iraqi leader. But officials
acknowledge that the Clinton administration is not yet willing to
undertake the aggressive military and intelligence actions they
believe would be essential to support a coup against Saddam anytime
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody that I know of has a strategy that they think will get
rid of Saddam in the next six months or year, unless you are
willing to put in a large U.S. ground force there,'' said one
administration official.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials believe that last week's bombing
campaign, which targeted the Iraqi Republican Guards and other
critical elements of Saddam's regime, did erode his ability to
control his country.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration has never shown a willingness to link
such aggressive military actions against Iraq directly to a coup,
officials acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Iraqi opposition groups and others in the region
have proposed that the United States pledge to provide air support
for potential coup plotters who might rise up from within the Iraqi
military in Bagdhad, officials said. They said that the United
States could support coup plotters by extending the no-flight zone
to cover Bagdhad and central Iraq. It is not publicly known whether
there are any current Iraqi military leaders willing to mount a
coup.
</P>
<P>
   Dissatisfied Iraqi military officers have made it clear that
they would need protection from Saddam's attack helicopters before
they would be willing to take on the regime, government officials
in the Middle East and people knowledgeable about American
activities in the region say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military units, the tribes, have always said they are
afraid of what Saddam would do with his helicopters,'' said one of
these officials. ``They say 'we need protection from that.'''
</P>
<P>
   The current no-fly zones, which are maintained under the
authority of the United Nations, bar Iraq from flying military
aircraft in the areas. They apply only to fixed-wing aircraft, and
so would have to be modified to protect a military uprising from
Iraqi helicopter forces.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States, which now maintains no-fly zones over
northern and southern Iraq, has never agreed to impose a
countrywide no-fly zone. One administration official said the idea
was briefly considered in 1996, when the United States expanded the
southern no-fly zone slightly further north. But the official said
that Washington could not generate enough support from other
countries in the region and abandoned the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Such a plan would strain U.S. air resources in the region,
posing logistical nightmares that would make it difficult to
maintain for long. ``Extending the no-fly zone is an option we have
looked at from time to time, but it has serious logistical
constraints,'' one administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet officials acknowledge that, short of a U.S.-led ground
invasion, providing air support could be one of the most important
things the United States could do to support an anti-Saddam coup.
In fact, U.S. air support for coup plotters has often surfaced as a
key issue in past conflicts around the world.

 WASHINGTON: the world.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the administration has not determined how to
transform the fractured Iraqi opposition into a legitimate
alternative to the current regime. Under congressional pressure,
the administration has been moving to increase its support for
opposition groups, even though most U.S. officials acknowledge that
those groups have little hope of gaining enough support within the
Iraqi Sunni Muslim elite to overthrow Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the weakness of the Iraqi opposition today, to rely only
on them to overthrow Saddam now would be a recipe for disaster,''
said one administration official. But Congress is criticizing the
administration for failing to take the opposition more seriously,
despite the president's rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's decision last month to embrace those groups
represented a significant policy shift.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the State Department and the CIA effectively abandoned
the opposition groups after the Iraqi regime had infiltrated and
then rolled up two groups linked to U.S.-backed covert action
programs. In June 1996, dissident Iraqi military forces with links
to the Iraqi National Accord, a CIA-backed opposition group based
in Amman, Jordan, were arrested by the regime. In August 1996, the
Iraqi military moved into a northern Iraqi enclave to decimate the
Iraqi National Congress, another CIA funded group that sought to
unite Kurdish and some Shia dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials and dissident leaders agree that administration
officials felt burned by the collapse of those covertly-backed
organizations, and for the next two years was reluctant to invest
much time or resources in rebuilding the opposition. Critics in
Congress also complain that the administration allowed the
opposition groups to atrophy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the administration focused on its policy of
containment, under which the United States sought to work through
the United Nations to try to keep a lid on Iraq's ability to
develop weapons of mass destruction while also maintaining
international support for economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   But in November, after his last-minute decision to pull back
from a bombing campaign against Iraq, Clinton announced a change in
policy. After opposing a congressional plan to provide $97 million
in U.S. funds to Iraqi opposition groups, he changed his mind, and
the administration struggled to come up with a new policy
initiative. The money has been approved by Congress but the law
gives Clinton until the end of January to decide which groups might
receive it. State Department and Pentagon officials had previously
dismissed the legislation as unrealistic, but since Clinton
embraced the plan, officials have been scrambling to find a way to
fit the opposition groups into the administration's Iraq policy.
Officials acknowledge that will take time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not ready,'' said one administration official,
referring to the opposition. ``They need lots of work.''

<P>
   SEATTLE _ For the online shopper at Amazon.com, it all looks so
easy this holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Easy for the customer, sure,'' said Todd Bradley, a
27-year-old cart runner threading through the maze of shelves at
the company's vast distribution center here. ``You just kick back
at home and wait.'' Cedric Ross, 29, the training manager, added:
``There's nothing virtual about it for us. We've got books to get
out the door here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle-based company has transformed the world of Internet
commerce, offering millions of book and compact-disk titles at
discount prices and generally tax-free, all just one click of a
computer mouse away. With 4.5 million customers in 160 countries,
and with orders coming in around the clock at the rate of more than
$20 a second, the three-year-old company and its 34-year-old
founder, Jeffrey P. Bezos, are already a marketing legend.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, though _ or at 5 a.m., which is when
Bezos and many of the company's other top executives have shown up
recently to help at the distribution warehouse, bleary-eyed and all
but oblivious to outside events like the impeachment crisis
engulfing the White House _ somebody has to put books in boxes. The
orders course through the electronic ether, but on the other end of
the transaction a human being still needs to fill them.
</P>
<P>
   For all the attention paid to the remarkable technology and
sophisticated software involved in electronic commerce, a glimpse
at this company in action during the frantic pre-Christmas rush
suggests that an online store like Amazon.com still needs plenty of
old-fashioned elbow grease to compete in the virtual marketplace.
Here, amid stacks and shelves and hundreds of old wooden library
carts, the company is engaged in an all-hands alert to fill holiday
orders on time.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the 1,600-employee business is computerized, a
worker still has to walk to a shelf and retrieve a book. And the
stock itself is arranged in a numbering system that would drive an
old Dewey-decimal librarian crazy. One case here in the warehouse
holds copies of ``Taxes for Dummies,'' ``The Tao of Sex,''
Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, the ``Goosebumps'' children's book
series and Immanuel Kant's ``Critique of Pure Reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally the orders that come in here are handled smoothly by an
energetic army of largely 20-something ``associates,'' who have
fast become a literally colorful part of company lore. Many dye
their hair in hues that range across the full spectrum, and adorn
an impressive number of pierced body parts with jewelry. All have
the good fortune to receive stock options in Amazon.com in addition
to their hourly wages.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks the company has been so thoroughly deluged
with holiday orders that it has hired hundreds of temporary workers
here and at its other big distribution center, in New Castle, Del.,
and brought executives from the downtown Seattle headquarters to
the warehouse in an industrial neighborhood here.
</P>
<P>
   Not that those executives are buttoned-down types themselves: at
the headquarters, it is far easier to find dogs, which are welcome
to hang out there with their masters, than neckties, which appear
to be distinctly frowned upon. In any event, some of the company's
brainiest talent, people who are usually found designing new Web
pages or researching other products for potential sales online, can
now be found taking the merchandise off the shelves one book at a
time, or pitching in at the loading docks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With Christmas now at hand, the company says it has largely met
its commitment to ship any book in stock out the door within 24
hours. That is a commitment that holds the key to an online
company's success, and Amazon.com's ability to expand and keep
meeting it is the subject of fervent debate among stock analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Although the company has yet to actually report a profit, its
stock has continued to soar, reaching $329 a share today, its
highest level ever, before closing at $322.375. Some analysts say
the price still has far to go. Henry Blodget of CIBC Oppenheimer
said last week that he expected it to hit $400 within a year, and
pronounced the company ``in the early stages of building a global
electronic-retailing franchise that could generate $10 billion in
revenue and earnings per share of $10 within five years.'' (Sales
in the most recent quarter were $153.7 million.)
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts remain skeptical. Jonathan Cohen, a senior
analyst at Merrill Lynch Global Securities, called the current
trading price ``truly outrageous'' and said the company should be
valued at $50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Like all employees of Amazon.com, Bezos _ who so named his
company because the image of a huge volume of water tracked his
goal of dealing in a huge volume of books _ refuses to comment on
the stock price for the record. Its officials say the company is
focused solely on developing its customer base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Underpromise and overdeliver,'' said David Risher, the
32-year-old senior vice president and himself a book stocker in
recent days. ``It's completely what drives us. In this business,
the real power is in the hands of the customers. They're always one
click away from another store.''
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who registers as an Amazon.com customer, the
company's software makes it astoundingly easy _ literally one click
of the ``add it to your shopping cart'' icon _ to buy a book.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Risher puts it, ``it takes a lot of work to make it look
easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Koberg usually picks books for the company in her
position as an editorial director for its Web site, deciding which
titles to highlight in cyberspace. But the other day found her
helping out in the warehouse, picking books in a very different way
_ physically, off the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a collective effort,'' she said, gesturing toward the
teams of cart runners, gift wrappers and box packers that filled
the warehouse. ``It's a big job. So we just keep doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, the company was all but finished with the Christmas
rush. Officials were waiting for a flood of last-minute orders for
electronic gift certificates, but those, at least, require no heavy
lifting at all. They are ordered online, and automatically sent to
the recipient via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they're a procrastinator's dream,'' said Risher, warming
to a salesman's pitch. ``If it's 11:59 p.m. on Christmas Eve, you
can still order, and they'll arrive at 12:01 a.m. on Christmas
Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the millions of titles available and the bedlam in the
warehouse, a visitor cannot help noticing one paradox: no one can
actually come here and buy a book. This summer, Ross recalled with
a laugh, one woman with cash in hand managed to slip past the
security guards, and she started wandering around, looking at the
shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't know what to say to her,'' Ross said. ``I mean,
I had no frame of reference for what she was asking. So I just had
to say: `Lady, you can't buy a book in here. The CEO of the company
can't buy a book here, unless he goes online.' ''

 NBA ENTERING 11th HOUR FOR A DEAL   By MIKE WISE   c. 1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fearing that it will hurt negotiations with the players union,
Commissioner David Stern has steadfastly refused to issue a
so-called drop-dead date that would signal the cancellation of the
entire 1998-99 National Basketball Association season. But as the
league's contentious labor dispute motors toward its sixth month
without resolution, it appears that such a date is within days of
being announced.
</P>
<P>
   League officials are considering a date for a special Board of
Governors meeting to be convened the first week of January in New
York. The main item on the agenda: a vote of representatives from
the 29 teams on whether to terminate what is left of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, we'll have to have a board meeting to cancel
the season,'' Russ Granik, the league's deputy commissioner, said
Tuesday night. ``I don't know if you would call that a drop-dead
date, but I guess some people will take it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Granik refused to release the date of the meeting or say when
the season will be canceled if the two sides cannot negotiate a new
collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The final decision rests with Stern, who is vacationing in
Aspen, Colo., and is not planning to return until next week. Billy
Hunter, the union's executive director, returned home to Oakland,
Calif., to spend the Christmas holiday with his family.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days after the last bargaining session, no new talks have
been scheduled, though Hunter was planning to speak to Stern over
the next couple of days, a union official said. As the owners and
players battle over how to share $2 billion in revenue, the first
three months of the season is about to be lost. Given that the
season cannot start until the last week of January, at the
earliest, more than $400 million in player salaries will be lost as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kevin Willis of the Toronto Raptors became the second
player in four days to publicly support an owners' proposal
forwarded to the players last week by Stern. In an interview with
The Associated Press, Willis called for players to vote on the
proposal by secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority would vote for the owners' latest proposal, just
to start playing ball again,'' Willis said.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Karl Malone of the Utah Jazz said on Saturday that he
thought the deal was fair, though he added that it needed some
``minor adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   Willis' comments weren't surprising, given that his agent,
Steven Woods of Atlanta, has harshly criticized Hunter; Patrick
Ewing, the union president, and the union itself the past few
months. In October, he was escorted by security guards from a
players meeting in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We conducted conference calls over the last two weeks with
more than 120 players on each call,'' said Dan Wasserman, the
union's communications director. ``At least a dozen players on each
call specifically told us they will wait for the negotiating
committee to recommend a deal that is worthy of putting to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every player is entitled to his opinion, although we have not
heard from Kevin Willis directly. But the vast majority of players
support the authority of the negotiating committee to recommend a
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   With both sides still trying to hash out key economic issues
relating to how the league will do business the next six to seven
years, union and league officials are beginning to acknowledge that
time for a settlement is running out.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter has said that the two sides are not as far apart as many
observers believe, and that a deal can be struck within 24 hours if
the parties show a willingness to compromise. But getting lawyers
and the chief negotiators into a room for that meeting is another
story. The next meeting will most likely not take place before
Monday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two union officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
said that if a deal cannot be struck between Jan. 5 and 10, at the
latest, they believe Stern will cancel the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in the right time frame,'' Granik said. ``We don't
want this to be a fatalistic situation. Frankly, I'll be surprised
if we don't have another meeting before canceling the season. But
right now, I don't have any reason to be optimistic about the
results.''

FOR ITS DIRECTOR, `HURLYBURLY' WAS ALL ABOUT ACTING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It all started when Anthony Drazan decided to find
out how the other half learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to study acting,'' Drazan recalled recently, easing
into a long conversation in the dark lobby cafe of a hotel on
Manhattan's Central Park South. After directing two well-received
films, ``Zebrahead'' and ``Imaginary Crimes,'' in the early 90s, he
felt a need for a deeper understanding of what transpired on his
set as the camera rolled, a desire to puzzle out the meaning of the
moment when an actor lets down his guard and begins to speak in
other people's words.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1995, Drazan, a thoughtful, gregarious man who carefully
ruminates over his own words, enrolled in a Los Angeles acting
class. ``And the first scene I did,'' Drazan said, ``was from
`Hurlyburly.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A performer wasn't born that day _ ``I did that scene about as
poorly as I could,'' he said _ but a movie was. Once the director
became immersed in David Rabe's scathing 1984 play about the
volatile lives of a group of Hollywood bottom-feeders, he couldn't
let go. Within months, he was on a plane to see Rabe in northwest
Connecticut and try to get his consent to make ``Hurlyburly'' the
movie, an idea the playwright had twice rejected in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal by Drazan, however, seemed more heartfelt to the
leery Rabe. ``The key thing was I could feel his personal
involvement with the movie,'' Rabe recalled. ``I said yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   After an exhausting three-year odyssey comes the all-star
``Hurlyburly'' that opened Friday in New York and Los Angeles for a
weeklong run to qualify for the Oscar race, before a nationwide
release in January.
</P>
<P>
   Made a year ago on a puny budget of $4 million, a sum that no
doubt would have had the movie's jaded industry types in stitches,
``Hurlyburly'' features a powerhouse ensemble that includes Sean
Penn, Kevin Spacey, Meg Ryan, Anna Paquin, Chazz Palminteri, Robin
Wright Penn and Garry Shandling, playing an assortment of shallow,
self-absorbed, cocaine-snorting, hair-trigger-tempered opportunists
alternately indulging in and resisting their basest impulses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurlyburly'' is not your typical shimmering Christmas flick:
The story, filled with moments of acidic humor, is a withering
depiction of male friendship, and a fairly brutal portrait of the
ways men use and abuse the opposite sex. Analyzing the original
stage version in 1984, Frank Rich of The New York Times called it
``shocking in its refusal to observe any recent cease-fires in the
war between men and women.''
</P>
<P>
   The script, written by the playwright and the director, may have
been an actor's delight, but it was a producer's albatross. Even
after the signing of the formidable Penn, who appeared in a
production of the play in 1988 at the Westwood Playhouse in Los
Angeles, and the expression of interest by the Oscar-winning
Spacey, Drazan and Rabe still had little luck finding financial
backing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I decided to form a partnership with Tony to make the
movie, my lawyer was saying, `Why are you becoming a partner with
him?' '' said Rabe, a protege of the Public Theater impresario,
Joseph Papp, and the author of several hit plays in the 1970s and
80s, among them ``Streamers'' and ``Sticks and Bones.'' ``But my
thought was, if this ever will be a movie, Tony will have earned
his money.''
</P>
<P>
   Backing was eventually obtained through the sale of foreign
rights and the actors worked for minimal salaries. Fine Line
Features later bought the domestic rights to the finished film,
completed in 30 days of shooting in the Hollywood Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulties the filmmakers encountered may say something
about the treacherous climate in Hollywood these days for movies
that attempt, even in the broadest ways, to portray the darker
aspects of the film business. At least superficially,
``Hurlyburly'' deals with images of itself that the movie industry
probably prefers not to have advertised, particularly drug-taking;
the coke in ``Hurlyburly'' flows as freely as, well, Coke.
</P>
<P>
   Some advance viewers have already been made profoundly
uncomfortable by the portrayal of women. Ms. Paquin's Donna, for
instance, a young drifter who survives on her precocious knack for
pleasuring men, is handled by her minders as a valueless object.
She is brought by Artie, played by Shandling, to the house in the
Hollywood Hills that Penn's Eddie shares with his friend and
partner, Spacey's Mickey, and offered as a gift. ``You can keep
her,'' Shandling tells them. ``Like a CARE package.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rabe, his thick, snow-white hair virtually aglow in the dim
hotel cafe, laughed wearily at how literally his characters were
taken by some famous actors he and Drazan approached with parts in
the film. It seemed as if some mistook ``Hurlyburly'' for a
documentary expose.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was one turndown where the guy said: `I used to treat
women this way; I don't anymore,' '' Rabe recalled. A potential
investor said no, too, because of the depiction of drug use. ``He
didn't want to take it on because his boss' son was in rehab.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer and the director profess bewilderment at the
defensive reaction to ``Hurlyburly.'' Rabe's characters,
principally Eddie and Mickey, have all of what the outside world
views as the trappings of industry insider-dom: countless cellular
phones, obscure European sports cars, undiscoverable sources of
income. And yet show business is only a backdrop for the story,
which focuses more intensively on the interior struggles of Rabe's
troubled men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurlyburly'' is no attempt to outdo ``The Player,'' Robert
Altman's highly specific back-lot-and-front-office satire; in fact,
audiences never even learn what exactly Eddie and Mickey do in the
business (there's one brief office scene, in which Penn and Spacey
inscrutably pore over actors' 8-by-10 glossies).
</P>
<P>
   Still, Drazan said, he and the film's production designer,
Michael Haller (who died shortly after filming), were determined to
be meticulous about conjuring the humdrum surfaces of movieland. In
a film so much concerned with facades, they made their motif ``the
everyday L.A. that the people in the Hills experience _ the dry
cleaners, the for-sale signs in front of every house.''
</P>
<P>
   A scene in a cemetery, where one of Eddie's and Mickey's friends
is being laid to rest, is shot so that the Paramount studio water
tower is visible in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   Rabe's play has been artfully reimagined. Haller's gadget-filled
Los Angeles interiors and unflattering exteriors _ never have the
Hollywood Hills looked so unglamorous _ skillfully illuminate
Rabe's sleazy types; it's as if someone had torn away the shiny
tile and exposed the roaches crawling in the plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   This is the territory of hungry men on the make, sloppy in their
household affairs and even more careless in their handling of other
people. Their cars and cell phones, in which and on which they
virtually live, define the limited range of their imaginations; in
one witty sequence, Eddie and Mickey begin an argument (over a
woman) in the ugly house they share and seamlessly continue it on
their car phones as they zig and zag on winding roads to the office
they also happen to share.
</P>
<P>
   Drazan's introduction to ``Hurlyburly,'' that scene in acting
class, provided him with a window into Rabe's work. ``It was the
French-Chinese restaurant scene,'' he said, referring to a fight
between Eddie and his wavering girlfriend Darlene (played in the
movie by Penn's wife, Robin Wright Penn), over whether to have
dinner in a French or Chinese restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Darlene says she has no preference, she likes them both, but
Eddie, in the perfect irrationality of couples' confrontations,
turns her fence-straddling into an emotional opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they're different,'' he screams. ``One is French, and the
other is Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   Darlene is unmoved. ``Not in my inner emotional subjective
experience of them,'' she shouts back.
</P>
<P>
   It was through the humor and the universal truths uncovered in
that interlude _ ``There was no bottom in that scene,'' he said
admiringly _ that Drazan fell in love with ``Hurlyburly.'' Now, he
and Rabe have their fingers crossed that audiences, too, will see
in their movie worlds beyond the twists and turns of Mulholland
Drive.

IS THAT A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At best, it's one of the most bizarre incidents in
years involving an athletic director defending his basketball
coach. At worst, Washington State's Rick Dickson may have tarnished
his reputation forever.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, while trying to defend coach Kevin Eastman, Dickson
told the Spokane Spokesman-Review that at the 1998 Final Four, two
coaches told him that no one has been able to win ``the right way''
in Pullman since Marv Harshman nearly three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   The subtle implication, of course, was that ex-Cougars coaches
George Raveling and Kelvin Sampson won the wrong way, although
Dickson did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson then told a radio station that Kansas' Roy Williams and
Oklahoma State's Eddie Sutton were the coaches at the Final Four.
However, when contacted, Williams denied meeting _ or knowing _
Dickson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't know him if he walked into my office,'' Williams
reportedly said.
</P>
<P>
   Did Dickson lie? Well, he quickly called Williams and
apologized, but he did not reach Raveling, who told the
Spokesman-Review: ``I think I was immensely loyal (to Washington
State). For Rick Dickson to come in and put a cloud over us like
that is shameful.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickson is well regarded within Pacific-10 circles, a solid
businessman with a quality sorely lacking among many league
administrators: vision. He did not like Sampson and never worked
with Raveling, but there's no excuse for this mess.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that Washington State is the big loser. If
Dickson indeed fires Eastman after the season, who would want to
work there?
</P>
<P>
   The circus continues: Schea Cotton's journey began two years
ago, when he committed to Long Beach State. He tried to attend UCLA
but was denied admission because of an illegal, untimed entrance
exam. He spent a year at a prep school in Connecticut, then was
denied admission to North Carolina State.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after all that, he's back where he started _ living with
his parents in Long Beach while attending Long Beach City College.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton is averaging 28.8 points and shooting over 50 percent
from the field and from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the outcome of his lawsuit against the NCAA _ the
Cottons believe his SAT score should be waived because of what they
claim is a learning disability _ he may enroll in a four-year
school (doubtful), spend another year at LBCC (perhaps) or apply
for the NBA draft (likely).
</P>
<P>
   ``We look for the worst and hope for the best,'' said Cotton's
mother, Gaynell. ``We were more optimistic before we went through
all this.''
</P>
<P>
   Strange lineup: Not many elite programs would bother to schedule
an Ivy League opponent not named Princeton or Pennsylvania, much
less play an Ivy League opponent on the road gym. But North
Carolina has always scheduled to its own beat, which explains its
trip to Dartmouth last week.
</P>
<P>
   Former coach Dean Smith often scheduled games in the hometowns
of his seniors and always tried to play former assistants once they
became head coaches. Smith controls UNC's schedule in retirement,
and his traditions continue.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, North Carolina played Appalachian State and Middle
Tennessee State, which are coached by former Tar Heels Buzz
Peterson and Randy Wiel, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Smith scheduled a three-game series with Buffalo,
of all teams, because its assistant coach, Eric Eisenberg, was
point guard Ed Cota's high school coach.
</P>
<P>
   It's refreshingly unusual approach.
</P>
<P>
   Around the nation: Fresno State coach Jerry Tarkanian got his
696th victory last week, but No. 700 may take a while. The Bulldogs
have Wisconsin, Temple and New Mexico in coming weeks.... Yes,
Auburn is for real, with its best start in 40 years and a super
newcomer, forward Chris Porter, a transfer from Chipola J.C. in
Marianna, Fla. He's averaging 16 points and 7.7 rebounds....
Kansas' loss to Iowa two weeks ago means Murray State has the
nation's longest home-court winning streak (33 games)....
</P>
<P>
   Louisville's 27-point victory over talented DePaul doesn't bode
well for UCLA, which plays at Louisville Jan. 23. Both the Bruins
and Blue Demons rely heavily on freshmen... Whatever happened to
Georgetown?...
</P>
<P>
   Tickets are available for Jim Harrick's Dec. 29 return to L.A.
(a.k.a. Rhode Island at Pepperdine).
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Around the Pac-10:!off! Arizona freshman (and Bell-Jeff
grad) Ruben Douglas was banished to Tucson _ and missed the Iowa
State game _ after he ran through hallways, banged on doors and
broke lights at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas....
</P>
<P>
   Washington senior guard Donald Watts sprained his right ankle at
Boise State on Dec. 5 and hasn't played since. He ran Monday and is
questionable for Thursday's matchup with New Mexico. Washington
lost to Boise State and Gonzaga without him....
</P>
<P>
   Oregon forward A.D. Smith may be the most improved player in the
league, but 7-foot center Mike Carson is the key to a breakthrough
season....
</P>
<P>
   In case you missed it: Arizona State forward Mike Batiste had 23
points and 18 rebounds in his debut Saturday, a triple-overtime win
at Texas A&AMP;M....
</P>
<P>
   Get ready for four good games when the Arizona schools visit USC
and UCLA on Jan. 2-4. If the Bruins and Trojans hope to contend for
the league title, they must win both.

   The New York Times' computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is a fairly large
difference between Minnesota (no. 1) and the Jets (2), but very
little difference between San Francisco (4) and Denver (5).

 UNDATED: the scheme.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It acknowledged that from August 1994 to June 1995, its
officials falsely told the U.S. Customs Service that 26 loads of
its Canadian cigarettes were passing through the United States
solely for export to Russia or the Republic of Estonia, thus
helping the distributors evade the $2.5 million in American excise
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But in truth, Maroney said, the Northern Brands officials knew
that the cigarettes were destined to be smuggled back into Canada.
``Certainly, the whole business was done with the knowledge and
assistance on their part,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian officials, who also are investigating possible
violations of Canadian law, said that the smuggling by these and
other rings became so intense that the Canadian government
ultimately had no choice but to start rolling back the cigarette
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   David T. Sweanor, an antismoking advocate in Canada, said the
smuggling cost Canada even more than the United States in lost
taxes. He also said that the popularity of smoking among young
people declined while the taxes were high but had since risen
again.
</P>
<P>
   After Northern Brands made the guilty plea, Federal District
Judge Thomas McAvoy imposed a $5 million fine on Tuesday and
ordered the company to pay $10 million to the U.S. Treasury Asset
Forfeiture Fund.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, two sales managers for the Brown &AMP; Williamson
Tobacco Corp., BAT's subsidiary in the United States, also have
pleaded guilty to aiding smugglers who slipped cigarettes into
Canada in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities in Spain, Italy and China have also begun major
investigations into cigarette smuggling. But while they have
occasionally caught low-level operatives, they rarely have been
able to bring charges against a large corps of middlemen who often
buy cigarettes from the manufacturers and then resell them to
smugglers _ and thus insulate the major companies from the
contraband operations.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: EXTENDED-STAY HOTELS EXPAND IN NEW YORK CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Also moved in ``t'' category.)

 By JANE LEVERE

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The extended-stay hotel segment is growing in
Manhattan, with two new hotels opened since last spring, and
several more under development.
</P>
<P>
   The two newest hotels are the Marmara-Manhattan which opened in
April, and the Envoy Club, which opened last month; the Envoy Club
also plans to build two additional hotels. Other extended-stay
hotels in Manhattan include the Bristol Plaza, the Sutton and the
Phillips Club. Nine Manhattan East Suite hotels offer
accommodations to both transient and extended-stay guests.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations often lease apartments in these extended-stay
hotels for their employees' use. In most cases, the apartments
contain business services, like fax machines and multiline
telephones. Amenities like concierge and daily maid service and
health club access are also available. Most have full kitchens and
range in size from studios to three bedrooms. A minimum stay of 30
days is usually required.
</P>
<P>
   Extended-stay hotels in Manhattan generally feature more
sophisticated furnishings and services, and charge higher rates
than those in other parts of the country. According to
PricewaterhouseCoopers, extended-stay hotel companies like
Residence Inn, owned by Marriott International, and Homewood
Suites, owned by Promus, charge an average rate nationwide of
between $600 and $700 a week, and usually require a minimum stay of
seven days; this compares with the 30-day minimum stay required in
Manhattan, at a minimum monthly rate of close to $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Hennessey, the director of the PricewaterhouseCoopers
hospitality and leisure consulting practice in New York, said New
York could support more expensive extended-stay hotels than other
cities because guests tended to be high-level executives who are
more demanding and willing to pay more for the hotels' services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of Manhattan, extended-stay properties often cater to
mid- and junior-level relocations, or members of an auditing team,
but here you have a lot of headquarters-type people,'' Hennessey
said.
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the most popular extended-stay hotels in
Manhattan:
</P>
<P>
   _The Bristol Plaza, which opened in 1988 and is owned by
Milstein Partners, has 167 apartments. There is also a rooftop
health club with a 50-foot swimming pool. Monthly rates range from
$5,200 to $14,000.
</P>
<P>
   _The Envoy Club, which has 58 apartments, occupies five floors
of a 23-story apartment building owned by RFR/Davis. The hotel has
a health club, roof-deck solarium and a private screening room that
can be rented. Monthly rates start at $4,800 and go up to $11,500.
</P>
<P>
   _The nine Manhattan East Suite Hotels, owned by the Denihan
family, offer monthly rates that range from $4,950 to $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   _The Marmara-Manhattan, owned by Kiska Developers Inc., has 107
apartments and is in a building that was once condominium
apartments. The hotel has an exercise room and offers a daily
buffet breakfast, priced at $15 a person. Monthly rates go from
$3,750 to $13,000.
</P>
<P>
   _The Phillips Club, whose 96 studios and one- and two-bedroom
apartments occupy four floors of a 30-story apartment building,
offers guests a membership at the nearby Reebok Sports Club for
$165 a month. Rates at the Phillips Club, which is owned by
Millennium Partners, range from $5,500 to $17,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   _The Sutton, which opened in 1992 and is owned by Hong Kong and
Shanghai Hotels Ltd., has its own health club and 55-foot pool.
Monthly rates range from $4,800 to $14,000.

VIKINGS ROLL, BRONCOS STUMBLE INTO PLAYOFFS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Several thoughts floated around the Denver Broncos after
Monday night's loss in Miami: ``It was the Dolphins fighting to
make the playoffs and the fact we've already got home-field
advantage in the bag, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost to Pittsburgh and San Francisco in consecutive games
late in the year last year and then didn't lose again, all the way
to the Super Bowl _ so this is OK, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``True, there is a little funk, we've lost a little edge, but we
can recapture it, right? We won 13 straight. We've lost two
straight. What's the panic?''
</P>
<P>
   Right?
</P>
<P>
   After Denver's 31-21 loss, there was plenty of speculation among
the Broncos afterward about fires, putting some out and lighting
others, within their ranks. There was talk of having one of those
players-only meetings for later in the week. There was pressure.
There was doubt. There was confidence. There was doubt again. This
has to be their greatest fear: &UR;  &LR; Goodness, have we peaked already?
</P>
<P>
   Mike Shanahan, Denver's head coach, told his players they were
not making the plays they had made all season. He told them they
had become accustomed to winning and maybe now they took it for
granted. He warned them that mistakes would result in losing their
edge for good.
</P>
<P>
   So, Denver tries to get it right. To peak at the right time. Not
September. Not November. But in the playoffs. There is one
regular-season game left for each team. For those that are already
in the playoffs, how do you do it? How do you get there on a roll _
minus a flat tire?
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched some of the Denver-Miami game, and I saw a Miami
team that felt like they had let a couple of games get away and
they weren't going to let it happen again and turned up the
intensity,'' said Dennis Green, the Minnesota Vikings' head coach.
``Denver is not running the ball well right now. Miami took
advantage of that and really looks like a team that plays good
defense and can be dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Green talked about some of the teams that were peaking, getting
hot at the right spot. Playoff time: ``The Jets have a running
game, and they've only given up 256 points and they have the No. 2
home-field position in the AFC. The Jets are peaking. Green Bay is
coming. They've got Dorsey Levens back and Brett Favre is back on
track. They don't like what we're doing. They've got an attitude.
Atlanta can run that ball.''
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to peaking, Green's Vikings lead the pack.
</P>
<P>
   With a 14-1 record and a final regular-season game left Saturday
at Tennessee, the Vikings have been peaking all season. A victory
over Tennessee would enable Minnesota to match the 1984 San
Francisco 49ers and the 1985 Chicago Bears as teams with 15-1
records. The Vikings are fast and quick on defense, especially on
artificial turf. They can stretch offenses with long, big gains on
the ground with running back Robert Smith and in the air with
rookie receiver Randy Moss. With 12 more points, they will break
the record for points in a season _ 541 _ set by Washington in
1983.
</P>
<P>
   They have followed Green's plan for peaking in the playoffs to a
tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked at the very start of training camp about breaking
the season into five phases,'' Green said. ``Our guys responded.
And now that we are where we are, I don't want us to shut it down
and try to save ourselves for the playoffs. Denver did that in '96.
Kansas City did it in '97. Both of them never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to be 15-1. I think what's helped us late in the
year is we've played our final three games against AFC teams. We'll
have played Baltimore, Jacksonville and Tennessee to end the
regular season. We don't know those teams well. Our players know
they have to pay attention because they aren't familiar with them.
It's kept it interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Green has kept it interesting. At the beginning of the year, he
contemplated walking away from the Vikings. The team's ownership
was in turmoil, and _ with a season left on his contract _ the old
ownership wanted Green to decide in January if he would stay or go
and refused Green's demand for a contract extension. Green said he
changed his mind ``four or five times'' before deciding on Super
Bowl day, when Denver beat Green Bay for the championship, that he
would stay.
</P>
<P>
   Later came new Vikings ownership in Red McCombs. A new contract
for Green followed. Moss fell from the sky in the draft. Randall
Cunningham dropped in at quarterback and soared.
</P>
<P>
   Green had a good thing. How would he keep it going, especially
come playoff time?
</P>
<P>
   ``You adapt,'' Green said. ``You take it phase by phase. You
know your team. You have short goals, but you keep big goals in
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the old scheme of planning your work and working your
plan. It is having the right players not only in talent but also in
mindset. It is focus. It is luck.

<P>
   ``Even if we get to 15-1, there are a lot of good teams out
there that won't be 15-1,'' Green said. ``There are some teams
right now peaking that are making it good for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver thinks it can get back on track. Miami is hot for now.
The Jets deserve a look. Green Bay and Atlanta are hitting their
stride. Others plan a playoff peak and to surprise. But if Green's
Vikings make it all the way, win the whole show on Super Bowl day,
it would be a year to the day that he decided to stay in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Timing is everything.

NASDAQ   PLANS   TO OFFER   EARFUL WITH EARNINGS REPORTS BROADCAST
ONLINE
</HEADLINE>

   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Talk about access.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in January, investors can listen to earnings conference
calls on the Internet from some or all of the top 100 companies on
the Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq is kicking off a pilot program that will allow investors
to listen to broadcasts live or replayed at www.broadcast.com or
www.nasdaq-amex.com.
</P>
<P>
   Investors will be able to listen for free to management's
discussion of earnings and the company's outlook that historically
were made available only to analysts and institutional investors.
That means small investors won't have to just rely on analysts to
interpret earnings. They can make up their own minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's somewhat of a watershed event,'' said Sherry Manno,
spokeswoman for Broadcast.com in Dallas. ``It's leveling the
playing field for all investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq hopes its top 100 companies will join the voluntary
program. There's considerable interest thus far, officials said,
but Nasdaq still has to get firm commitments from the companies.
Nasdaq is paying the program's fees for a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is new ground,'' said Susan Arthur, director of
interactive services at Nasdaq. ``It's a new medium for companies
to reach a broad audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast.com, an Internet site that airs free radio and video
spots, said it has been putting on earnings conference calls even
before the Nasdaq program.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, Yahoo!, America Online, Nike, Dell and Motorola are
some companies that conduct conference calls on the site. It also
replays shareholders meetings of IBM, AT&AMP;T and other businesses, as
well as the NationsBank-BankAmerica merger press conference.
</P>
<P>
   By letting investors directly listen to, but not participate in,
the calls themselves, they bypass any spin that analysts might put
on it, said Bob O'Hara, vice president of development at the
National Association of Investors Corp., an investment club
association in Madison Heights, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   It also gives the information to individual investors at the
same time analysts get it. In fact, Securities and Exchange
Commission officials recently said that analyst-only earnings
conference calls could be interpreted as illegal since companies
are required to fully disclose any material issues which may affect
the value of their shares. Discussing earnings with only analysts
isn't full disclosure, officials said. &QL;

COMPUTER PROBLEMS MAY DELAY JOBLESS BENEFITS IN SOME STATES
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ariz., Del., Hawaii, Ill., Kan., Mass., Mo., Mont., N.H.,
N.M., Vt.) (fb) 
By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At least 11 states will miss next month's deadline
to fix computers used to pay unemployment insurance, but the states
are making stopgap arrangements to avoid any interruption of
benefits, federal officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The computer problems with unemployment insurance are similar to
those that threaten many federal and state government programs and
business activities of corporations in the next two years, but the
effects could come sooner in offices that send checks to unemployed
workers.
</P>
<P>
   A person filing a claim for jobless benefits typically has a
year to draw all the checks to which he or she is entitled. The
last day of this ``benefit year'' is recorded when an application
is received. So computers must be able to handle dates with the
year 2000, starting next month.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy secretary of labor, Kathryn O. Higgins, said the
states lagging behind schedule were Arizona, Delaware, Hawaii,
Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire,
New Mexico and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said, Connecticut and Louisiana are not yet
ready, but have told federal officials that they will make the
necessary changes in their computers within 10 days. In the
District of Columbia, problems are so severe that the Labor
Department has assigned some of its employees to the city to make
sure jobless benefits are paid next year.
</P>
<P>
   John A. Koskinen, a White House official who supervises
preparations for the year 2000, said unemployment insurance was one
of the first government programs that could be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins said it was a test case, showing what would happen when
``the New Deal meets the new millennium.'' Many of the computer
systems used to pay jobless benefits are more than 30 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem arises from early computer programmers
often using a two-digit format to express the year. In such
computer programs, 2000 is often indistinguishable from 1900. If
the problem is not corrected, experts say, computers could produce
inaccurate data or shut down.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey of the states by the General Accounting Office,
an investigative arm of Congress, found that many were behind
schedule in renovating their computers. Only one-third of the 421
computer systems used for seven major health, welfare and nutrition
programs were ready for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins said there would inevitably be ``glitches'' in the
payment of jobless benefits next year. ``For the system to work
perfectly, states would have to anticipate every chip, every piece
of code that's in the system,'' she said. ``Everybody expects that
there will be some states where they don't catch everything.''
</P>
<P>
   But Koskinen, the chairman of President Clinton's Council on
Year 2000 Conversion, an interagency group, said: ``There is no way
to guarantee that your testing has been thorough and deep enough to
catch all the problems. People ought to expect that there will be
individualized small problems and errors.''
</P>
<P>
   Some state contingency plans call for checks to be issued by
hand. Under other plans, people would be certified as eligible for
benefits through Dec. 31, 1999, even if they were actually eligible
for a longer period running into the year 2000. Alternatively, a
state having difficulties could seek help from other states with
extra computer capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment insurance program, created by the Social
Security Act of 1935, is administered mainly by the states, but the
federal government provides most of the money for benefits.

CRAFT'S RENDEZVOUS WITH ASTEROID IS RESCHEDULED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)  (mk) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An errant spacecraft that was to be the first to
orbit an asteroid will instead fly past its intended target on
Wednesday, but scientists said Tuesday that they still held hopes
of completing the original mission in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The robot spacecraft, called NEAR, for Near Earth Asteroid
Rendezvous, is apparently healthy after a 27-hour blackout that
began late Sunday after a series of rocket firings to move the
craft toward an orbit of the asteroid 433 Eros.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics
Laboratory in Laurel, Md., which built the spacecraft and is
managing the mission, said NEAR would fly past Eros at 1:43 p.m. ET
on Wednesday, coming as close as 2,480 miles. During the flyby, the
craft is to photograph about 500 images and search for possible
tiny moons orbiting the asteroid.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Andrew Cheng, the project scientist, said it might still be
possible for the spacecraft to enter orbit around Eros in May 2000,
when orbits of the spacecraft and asteroid again coincide. Before
then, engineers have to resolve problems associated with firing the
craft's rocket engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears our spacecraft has not yet used up all its lives,''
Cheng said. `We still have a good chance of getting into Eros
orbit.''
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft was to have gone into orbit around Eros on Jan.
10, after a number of rocket burns to slow the craft so it could
settle in around the asteroid. Eros is a potato-shaped object
measuring 25 miles by 9 miles by 8.8 miles. No spacecraft has ever
orbited an object so small.
</P>
<P>
   Plans called for the spacecraft to survey the asteroid with its
six instruments, determining things like its mass, chemical
composition and density. After about a year, the craft was to have
descended into orbits so low it would hover just a few hundred feet
above the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Farquhar, a Johns Hopkins University scientist and
the mission manager, said at a briefing last week that researchers
hoped to end the mission with a landing, preceded by a series of
tricky maneuvers in which the craft would graze the surface and
then pop back up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be possible to land softly and then go back up
again,'' Farquhar said. ``We want to sort of test the waters.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists want to learn more about asteroids because they may
contain material from which the solar system was formed more than 4
billion years ago. In addition, they said, some asteroids may be
pieces of larger bodies or planets that formed early in the solar
system's history and later collided with other objects and broke
apart.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the nature of asteroids also is important because
they occasionally collide with Earth, sometimes with disastrous
effects. An asteroid six miles across is thought by many to have
smashed into Earth 65 million years ago, causing the extinction of
the dinosaurs and thousands of other species.
</P>
<P>
   To protect Earth in the future, scientists say people need to
know the density and composition of asteroids so they can determine
how to shatter or divert them with explosives or other means.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The spacecraft was launched in February 1996. Last June, the
craft flew within 753 miles of another asteroid, Mathilde. It took
500 photographs and made measurements that determined that Mathilde
was a low-density object, probably what some astronomers described
as a ``pile of rubble,'' instead of a solid piece of rock.
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft's problems arose on Sunday when its main engine
fired for the first time since July 1997, while it was 220 million
miles from Earth. Engineers said the engine briefly exceeded its
thrust tolerance and shut down. Less than a minute later, the
spacecraft lost its orientation because of a software problem and
began tumbling.
</P>
<P>
   The craft then went into a ``safe mode,'' with most of its
instruments shut down, and kept its solar power panels directed
toward the Sun while it awaited orders. NASA then ordered its Deep
Space Network of giant radio antennas to sweep the sky for the
spacecraft's faint signal, and NEAR was finally located on Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Weary project engineers, elated that the spacecraft was safe and
had not blown up, re-established communication and were able to
download enough data Tuesday to diagnose the problems and look for
alternative ways to complete the mission.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Worth, a program spokeswoman, said the craft appeared to
be fully functional and that scientists and engineers were
optimistic about achieving the program's goals.
</P>
<P>
   NEAR is one of the first NASA interplanetary spacecraft built
under its new Discovery Program, which emphasizes ``cheaper,
faster, better'' ways of exploring the universe. The spacecraft
cost $129 million to build, and the mission has so far stayed
within its planned budget of $211.5 million.

KOTITE SEES A SUPER BOWL `UP FOR GRABS'  (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALD ESKENAZI 
 
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ The Jets have been winning so decisively, Rich
Kotite was saying, that the Super Bowl ``is up for grabs.''
</P>
<P>
   Kotite hasn't talked about the Jets since he stepped down as
their coach two years ago after a franchise-worst 1-15 record. The
Jets were 4-28 in his two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But now, from his home on Staten Island, Kotite spoke with
admiration about the job Bill Parcells has done since taking over
in 1997. Over the weekend, the Jets became a division champion for
the first time since 1969 when they played in the old American
Football League. They then earned a bye week in the playoffs when
Jacksonville lost to Minnesota on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called Steve Gutman Monday morning to congratulate him,''
Kotite said, referring to the team's president.
</P>
<P>
   Of Parcells, Kotite said: ``Bill, who's been a friend of mine
for many years, has done a magnificent job. He's a neighborhood guy
from New Jersey, and I'm a neighborhood guy from Brooklyn.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, meanwhile, described Kotite as ``a guy I've always
liked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not buddy-buddy, but I had him over to my club two years
ago,'' Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has presided over a remarkable transformation: the
first time in league history that a coach has inherited a
one-victory team and turned it into a division winner in two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Kotite sounded genuinely happy for his former team. ``I have a
history with the Jets,'' he explained. ``I go back to the 1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   Kotite was the club's tight ends coach, as well as receivers
coach and then offensive coordinator under Joe Walton. ``Steve
Gutman and Leon Hess, they're part of my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Kotite's first victory as head coach of the Jets, in 1995, came
over Jacksonville, a club the Jets may face in the playoffs after
the bye week.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Kotite would not make any comparisons to his Jets' tenure
and Parcells', but he did concede that Parcells had a lot to
overcome, including the team's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to crunch time, I'll take Parcells,'' Kotite
said about the playoffs. ``He knows how to handle it. For so many
years, not just the two years preceding it, the team hadn't known
success.''
</P>
<P>
   He was reminded about some of the players he helped bring to the
Jets, who have blossomed, such as the free agents Wayne Chrebet and
Chad Cascadden.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of the current Jets joined the team during Kotite's
troubled tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Chrebet is one of football's top receivers and Cascadden has
become a key linebacker in various situations, while remaining a
major component of the special teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see a lot of those kids doing well, I feel great for
them,'' Kotite said. ``The coaching staff has done a great job. I'm
so happy for their day in the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   In assessing the Jets' playoff chances, he noted how the team
had won on the road, won 11 of 13 games after starting out 0-2, and
suggested that the Jets ``just kept getting tougher and tougher.
They're doing it so decisively, it's up for grabs. They've got a
great blend on the football team. That comes from leadership. And
that bye week is invaluable.''
</P>
<P>
   He concluded: ``It's great. It's a long time coming.''
</P>
<P>
   As for what the future holds for Kotite, he said that he was
considering some opportunities that are related to sports and
business. The 54-year-old said he would not go into college
coaching _ which he did many years ago _ and said he was not
interested in going to Hollywood, although he plays a basketball
coach in an as-yet-to-be-released film, starring Kelsey Grammer.

CREDIT CRUNCH:   STAYING ON TOP OF BILLS KEY TO CLEAN RECORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ OK, you're a rather disorganized sort whose mail
piles up and up and up on your desk, kitchen table and every other
available surface for days or even weeks before you get to it.
</P>
<P>
   When you finally decide to do some cleaning you find, stuck
between a magazine and a mailer for a dating service, a credit card
bill that turns out to be overdue. You don't worry much _ after
all, it was only for $54.73 _ and pay it. And when you decide to
clean your house or apartment you find, scrunched under a sofa
cushion, a months-old bill that was never paid.
</P>
<P>
   Still not particularly alarmed, you promise yourself to be more
organized in the future. As for that second, unpaid bill, well, it
was the creditor's fault for not sending a second notice _ or at
least, not one that you ever found in your piles of mail.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's time to start worrying.
</P>
<P>
   These incidents can make their way to your credit report,
resulting in bad credit that can harm your ability to finance a new
car, obtain loans, or cause you other problems that you'd be smart
to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   And once the negative information makes its way to your credit
report, it stays there for years, according to Maxine Sweet, vice
president of consumer education for credit reporting service
Experian. Chapter 7 bankruptcies will remain on your report for 10
years from the date of filing. But Chapter 13 bankruptcies _ that
is, those in which a consumer files a repayment plan _ will be
deleted after seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are some ways that you can in effect whitewash your
report. By establishing a subsequent credit record demonstrating
your financial responsibility, you could obtain credit or loans
despite the prior stain on your file.
</P>
<P>
   In these instances, the creditor will look at three things,
Sweet said: How long ago you were delinquent in your payment, the
number of times you didn't pay your bill and the severity of the
incidents _ that is, was it just one or two nonpayments, or did the
creditor have to write it off as a bad debt?
</P>
<P>
   Here's what to do:
</P>
<P>
   _ Bring your payments up to date and keep them current.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make sure all subsequent payments arrive on time, which should
counter the list of late payments on your record.
</P>
<P>
   _ After about two years of maintaining that record of on-time
payments, order a copy of your credit report and discuss it with
creditors who may look kindly on the new, improved fiscal you and
ignore the previous negative information.
</P>
<P>
   _ In general, stay away from ``credit repair clinics,'' which
can charge up to $1,000 for services that you can do for yourself
for free, and which have been known to engage in practices that may
not be entirely legal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, here are some things you can do to establish a
positive credit history and to minimize your problems if financial
difficulties force you to fall behind in your payments:
</P>
<P>
   _ Print clearly when applying for credit and always use your
complete name, which minimizes the chances of your file getting
mixed up with someone else's.
</P>
<P>
   _ Again, pay your bills on time.
</P>
<P>
   _ Review your credit report two to three months before making a
major purchase and immediately notify the reporting service about
any potentially harmful inaccuracies. Information that is proven
inaccurate or that cannot be verified as accurate with the source
will be removed from your record.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you fall behind in your payments, notify the lender who may
be willing to alter your payment schedule or interest rate.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pay off any overdue bills or debts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Consolidate your credit card debts into one manageable
account.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't use any more credit until you've got your finances under
control. Do not cut up all your credit cards, because doing so
won't help you establish a good record. Instead, keep one or two
accounts open _ and use them wisely. &QL;

 IN POLL, PUBLIC SAYS CLINTON SCANDAL WASN'T '98's MOST COMPELLING (See also IMPEACH, IMPEACH-POLL) 
(DW) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER    
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first impeachment of a president in 130 years was the stuff
of monster headlines, followed intensively by a mesmerized segment
of the population, but the public at large found President
Clinton's impeachment less compelling than a dozen other news
events in 1998, a survey has found.
</P>
<P>
   A new poll by the Pew Research Center, which measured the
intensity of public interest in news events, showed that those
surveyed said they cared less about impeachment than they did about
the school shootings in Arkansas and Oregon, the shootings in the
Capitol, the November elections, the summer heat wave and the
military strikes against Iraq, Afghanistan and the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   The findings cut against the grain of other evidence indicating
that, especially among viewers of cable television news, readers of
the three major news magazines and visitors to Internet news sites,
there has been an avid appetite for major news developments
stemming from Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But results of the survey, which was taken from Dec. 9 to Dec.
13 and from Saturday to Monday, were more consistent with the
Nielsen measurements of television audiences on Saturday as the
House of Representatives voted on impeachment. Viewers did flock to
CNN for Saturday's House votes; an average of 1.8 million
households watched, with the audience peaking at 5.3 million
households when President Clinton addressed the country between
4:15 and 4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS audience showed different tendencies. When CBS cut from
the impeachment hearings to the National Football League game
between the New York Jets and the Buffalo Bills, its viewership
quadrupled to about 12 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the People
and the Press, said Tuesday that his findings reflected the
disconnect between the public at large and the close watchers of
politics, government and scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a serious news segment and a political news segment
and a tabloid news segment, and all of them have a high interest in
this story,'' Kohut said.
</P>
<P>
   The intense interest among those groups, he said, drives news
magazine sales and the ratings of cable news shows. But, he added,
``if you talk about the larger public, which has said consistently,
`Enough of this,' there's not tremendous interest.''
</P>
<P>
   For Stephen G. Smith, the editor of U.S. News &AMP; World Report,
the survey findings simply demonstrate the desire of people in
surveys to put their best foot forward, rather than be
straightforward about their interest in subjects like sex and
scandal. The survey response on the impeachment events are ``a
classic case,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the nature of the story, because it involved sex
and other tawdry things,'' he said, ``people give the socially
desired response to pollsters: `Oh, God, I'm not interested in
that.' But when we have been forced to put Clinton on the cover
because of the news, those covers have done very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The verdict is still out on the sales of this week's news
magazines, which carry the story of the impeachment. But over the
past 11 months, three of Time Magazine's top-selling covers have
focused on the Clinton-Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   The issue with a cover article on the Arkansas school shooting _
the event that was ranked the most interesting of the year in the
Pew poll _ ranked 11th among best-selling issues of Time.
</P>
<P>
   For Newsweek, the Feb. 2 issue, featuring groundbreaking
coverage of Ms. Lewinsky's relationship with President Clinton, was
the year's best-selling issue at the newsstands.

DEAL REACHED TO KEEP STOCK EXCHANGE IN CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With a holiday cheer that belied six months of
sometimes tense negotiations, city and state officials announced
Tuesday that they had reached an agreement with the New York Stock
Exchange to build a trading complex and office tower just east of
the market's historic home on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which includes $900 million in cash, tax breaks
and other subsidies, would be the largest in city history to
prevent a business from leaving town. It is expected to bring an
end to threats by the stock exchange to move to Jersey City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Although many real estate executives, stockbrokers and urban
planners had doubted that the exchange would cross the Hudson
River, city and state officials feared that its departure would
lead to the breakup of the city's financial district.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani described the long-awaited deal as a
``Christmas gift to the city'' that would allow New York to remain
the financial capital of the world well into the next century.
Critics, on the other hand, described the subsidies as a form of
corporate welfare that shifts the tax burden to small and
medium-sized companies.
</P>
<P>
   City and state officials had originally offered the exchange
about $380 million in subsidies, but as the exchange continued to
play the New Jersey card, the value of the cash and incentives
jumped dramatically. Even after the two sides reached agreement on
the major elements of the deal in November, one city official said
the stock exchange spent the last month quibbling over details.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, the city and the state are to
buy an entire block bounded by Wall Street and Exchange Place,
between Broad and William streets, that is now occupied by a
450-unit apartment house and office buildings owned or controlled
by J.P. Morgan. The city and state would then build a
650,000-square-foot trading complex at a cost of at least $400
million.
</P>
<P>
   The complex would include two 50,000-square-foot trading floors,
as well as space for offices and computers. The stock exchange will
also receive $160 million in tax breaks and low-cost electricity. A
landmark building at 23 Wall St. would be incorporated into the new
structure.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the New York Stock Exchange, which has long been
cramped in its 96-year-old building at 11 Wall St., would pay rent
starting at $10 million a year and invest about $350 million in new
equipment for the trading complex. The stock exchange's existing
building would be used for executive offices and a police
substation.

<P>
   It had promised to be a sensational divorce case, with the
yuppette accused of incredible escapades. Testifying before her own
attorney, she projected an image of sweet innocence, and told a
tale of wifely fidelity and sacrifice, and was quite believable.
</P>
<P>
   When it was time for cross-examination though, the husband's
lawyer said, `Isn't it true on the night of June 12th, in a driving
rainstorm, you made love with a certain circus midget on the handle
bars of a careening motorcycle that passed through Columbia at
speeds in excess of seventy-five miles per hour?`
</P>
<P>
   The yuppette turned pale, but retained her remarkable
self-control and composure. Her voice was almost serene in its
innocence as she asked, `What was that date again?`

</P>
<P>
   `I have good news and bad news,` the owner replied. `The good
news is that a gentleman inquired about your work and wondered if
it would appreciate in value after your death. When I told him it
would, he bought all 15 of your paintings.`
</P>
<P>
   `That's wonderful,` the artist exclaimed. `What's the bad news?`

Saturday night, I stood outside ``The Lion King'' and flashed a
small scribbled sign that read ``Need one ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Instantly, a couple approached, saying: ``Our friend has an
extra ticket. And he paid $225 for it.'' They held out a bona fide
ticket for orchestra center. We quickly negotiated a very modest
price, and in minutes I was happily seated next to the man who was
stuck with the extra ticket and the financial loss. Feeling that I
at least owed him pleasant company, I said, ``Gee, this is lucky
for me, but what happened to the person who was supposed to have
this ticket?''
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I had to buy these so far in advance that while we
were waiting, we got a divorce,'' he said. ``The show ran longer
than the marriage.''

   Marvin Heffner and his wife, Anita, of Manakin-Sabot, Va., were
recently on a Shop Till You Drop bus trip to Manhattan. After doing
all the stores, Mrs. Heffner and a friend strolled on Fifth Avenue
and stopped in front of a Tiffany's window, where they stood beside
a ``very young thing arm in arm with an older gentleman.'' Mrs.
Heffner was delighted with the exchange she overheard.
</P>
<P>
   ``That bracelet is what I've always wanted,'' said the very
young thing.

   ``Try something not so expensive,'' the older gentleman said.

visage. A tall, gray-haired man came up to the officer and held out
his hand. ``I'm sorry for your loss,'' he said. ``We all cared for
Bobby Simone,'' he added, referring to the character that had been
played by Jimmy Smits on the television show.

</P>
<P>
   After a few minutes, an announcement came over the loudspeaker:
``This is your bus driver. I apologize for the tardiness. This bus
has made 46 runs today, and now it only seems to make red lights.
Most of you are going home to your wives, husbands, children, pets
or other loved ones. I know you must be tired, frustrated, annoyed,
angry, hungry or thirsty. Let me offer you a suggestion. When you
leave the bus, hand me your bad feelings. When I get to the Hudson
River, I'll throw them in the water. Have a pleasant evening and a
nice ride.''
</P>

   People were reanimated. Talk among us resumed and passengers
left the bus smiling.

   Future generations of school children at least can be grateful
they won't have to memorize much about Bob Livingston Era.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, too, have proposed censuring Mr.
Clinton to end impeachment proceedings. For what he did, wouldn't
this set a vice precedent?
</P>
<P>
   Polls show most Americans think politics in Washington is out of
control. Odd. We didn't know that many folks were paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Invoking the solemn power of impeachment in the cause of
partisan politics is wrong,'' says Al Gore. But do two articles of
wrong make a right wing?
</P>
<P>
   Post-impeachment polls show nearly three out of four Americans
approve of how Mr. Clinton is doing his job. Yes, but we bet some
of those supporters are single men who hope he can introduce them
to Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The president spent part of this week volunteering in a soup
kitchen. The impeachment vote and this proves he can both take it
and dish it out.
</P>
<P>
   If Mr. Clinton can be impeached, shouldn't his dog Buddy worry,
too? We mean about impoochment?
</P>
<P>
   It seems as if Rep. J. Dennis Hastert will become House speaker
now. It must be comforting to him that he'll have small shoes to
fill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stand ready to use force again if Saddam takes threatening
action,'' Mr. Clinton says. Really. He said Saddam, not Ken Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have inflicted significant damage on Saddam's weapons of
mass destruction programs,'' says Mr. Clinton. And on Christiane
Amanpour's sleep schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Four Republican House members who voted to impeach Mr. Clinton
now say they prefer censure. Aren't you glad these folks aren't
executioners?
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important gifts we give are those that we give to
those who need it the most,'' the president says. That's why
someone should send the president a copy of ``Crime and
Punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   JFK's daughter Caroline says Mr. Clinton should be censured, not
removed from office. Censure, in this case, would be the slam-a-lot
option.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore says he hopes the Senate will ``be the voice of reason,
deliberation and healing that America needs.'' Won't we first have
to elect Dr. Laura?
</P>
<P>
   What the kids on Santa's lap are saying: ``If Rudolph gets in
trouble, please don't impeach him. Just censure him.''
</P>
<P>
   Before entering politics, Denny Hastert, soon to be House
speaker, was a wrestling coach. Does Washington really need a
leader now who knows how to put a full Nelson on someone?
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Republicans nationally are at a low ebb in
popularity. Given high ratings for the president, maybe they should
think about becoming the Grand Old Partyers.
</P>

   A State Department spokesman says ``it's only a matter of time''

That's about 10 times better than Ken Starr's staff did.

   A new poll shows about 60 percent of Americans say Christmas is
their favorite holiday. How could you vote? Yes, no and, uh,

<P>
   Paddy and his two friends are talking at work.
</P>
<P>
   His first friend says, `I think my wife is having an affair with
the electrician. The other day I came home and found wire cutters
under our bed and they weren't mine.`
</P>
<P>
   His second friend says, `I think my wife is having an affair
with the plumber. The other day I found a wrench under the bed and
it wasn't mine.`
</P>
<P>
   Paddy says, `I think my wife is having an affair with a horse.`
</P>
<P>
   Both his friends look at him with utter disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   `No, I'm serious. The other day I came home and found a jockey
under our bed.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TOUGH YUP &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It had promised to be a sensational divorce case, with the
yuppette accused of incredible escapades. Testifying before her own
attorney, she projected an image of sweet innocence, and told a
tale of wifely fidelity and sacrifice, and was quite believable.
</P>
<P>
   When it was time for cross-examination though, the husband's
lawyer said, `Isn't it true on the night of June 12th, in a driving
rainstorm, you made love with a certain circus midget on the handle
bars of a careening motorcycle that passed through Columbia at
speeds in excess of seventy-five miles per hour?`
</P>
<P>
   The yuppette turned pale, but retained her remarkable
self-control and composure. Her voice was almost serene in its
innocence as she asked, `What was that date again?`

   &UR; GOOD NEWS/BAD NEWS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An artist asked the gallery owner if there had been any interest
in his paintings on display at that time.
</P>
<P>
   `I have good news and bad news,` the owner replied. `The good
news is that a gentleman inquired about your work and wondered if
it would appreciate in value after your death. When I told him it
would, he bought all 15 of your paintings.`
</P>
<P>
   `That's wonderful,` the artist exclaimed. `What's the bad news?`
</P>
<P>
   `The guy was your doctor.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CITY STREETS  &LR;  Ten minutes before curtain on a sold-out
Saturday night, I stood outside ``The Lion King'' and flashed a
small scribbled sign that read ``Need one ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Instantly, a couple approached, saying: ``Our friend has an
extra ticket. And he paid $225 for it.'' They held out a bona fide
ticket for orchestra center. We quickly negotiated a very modest
price, and in minutes I was happily seated next to the man who was
stuck with the extra ticket and the financial loss. Feeling that I
at least owed him pleasant company, I said, ``Gee, this is lucky
for me, but what happened to the person who was supposed to have
this ticket?''
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I had to buy these so far in advance that while we
were waiting, we got a divorce,'' he said. ``The show ran longer
than the marriage.''

   The painless New York way to do Christmas cards: The woman sat
at a table by the window in a Rockefeller Center cafe, with a
perfect view of the tree about 30 yards away. On the table in front
of her were four boxes of Museum of Modern Art cards, two sheets of
self-adhesive stamps, her address book and a large coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Hollenberg was strolling along Second Avenue with a
friend who is a lawyer. A boy of about 14 on a bicycle was trying
to hitch a ride by grabbing on to the rear of a moving truck. The
friend whipped out his card and handed it to the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to do that, you may need this,'' he said.

   Five-year-old Adam finished eating his chocolate cake at dinner.
His mother, Susan Kushner, told him she was proud of him. ``Why are
you proud of me?'' he asked. ``It isn't even healthy.''

   The class at Marymount College was discussing aesthetics, and
Lewis Burke Frumkes, who teaches critical thinking, asked the

   Marvin Heffner and his wife, Anita, of Manakin-Sabot, Va., were
recently on a Shop Till You Drop bus trip to Manhattan. After doing
all the stores, Mrs. Heffner and a friend strolled on Fifth Avenue
and stopped in front of a Tiffany's window, where they stood beside
a ``very young thing arm in arm with an older gentleman.'' Mrs.
Heffner was delighted with the exchange she overheard.
</P>
<P>
   ``That bracelet is what I've always wanted,'' said the very
young thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try something not so expensive,'' the older gentleman said.
``We just met last week.''
</P>
<P>
   It was late afternoon before the tree-lighting ceremony at
Rockefeller Center when the real NYPD Blue merged with the
fictional.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was large and good-natured, the weather was balmy, and
Stanley Adelman was standing next to a large policeman, stern of
visage. A tall, gray-haired man came up to the officer and held out
his hand. ``I'm sorry for your loss,'' he said. ``We all cared for
Bobby Simone,'' he added, referring to the character that had been
played by Jimmy Smits on the television show.
</P>
<P>
   The officer broke up laughing as he shook the man's hand. The
older man went on to repeat his condolences to another officer,
with the same results.
</P>
<P>
   We had been waiting a long time, several of us lamenting the
dearth of M14 crosstown buses. When one finally arrived, it was
crowded. We settled into available seats, lowered our eyes and kept
our once talkative mouths shut. An eerie silence fell.
</P>
<P>
   After a few minutes, an announcement came over the loudspeaker:
``This is your bus driver. I apologize for the tardiness. This bus
has made 46 runs today, and now it only seems to make red lights.
Most of you are going home to your wives, husbands, children, pets
or other loved ones. I know you must be tired, frustrated, annoyed,
angry, hungry or thirsty. Let me offer you a suggestion. When you
leave the bus, hand me your bad feelings. When I get to the Hudson
River, I'll throw them in the water. Have a pleasant evening and a
nice ride.''
</P>
<P>
   People were reanimated. Talk among us resumed and passengers
left the bus smiling.

   Don Dellair was on an M104 bus seated next to two young Asian
women. One was telling the other a long story in Japanese. The
second woman continued nodding as her companion droned on,
seemingly interminably. After five or six minutes, she looked up.
``Whatever,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The box-office personnel at the 47th Street Theater Development
Fund TKTS booth were flummoxed recently when a woman asked for a
ticket to ``the Princess Di show.'' It took a minute for them to
decipher the request. She had seen an advertisement for ``Dinah
Was,'' the musical about Dinah Washington, and immediately made the
broad jump to British royalty. Diana/Dinah _ whatever.

   &UR; BILL'S WORLD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   (Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star)
</P>
<P>
   Future generations of school children at least can be grateful
they won't have to memorize much about Bob Livingston Era.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, too, have proposed censuring Mr.
Clinton to end impeachment proceedings. For what he did, wouldn't
this set a vice precedent?
</P>
<P>
   Polls show most Americans think politics in Washington is out of
control. Odd. We didn't know that many folks were paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Invoking the solemn power of impeachment in the cause of
partisan politics is wrong,'' says Al Gore. But do two articles of
wrong make a right wing?
</P>
<P>
   Post-impeachment polls show nearly three out of four Americans
approve of how Mr. Clinton is doing his job. Yes, but we bet some
of those supporters are single men who hope he can introduce them
to Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The president spent part of this week volunteering in a soup
kitchen. The impeachment vote and this proves he can both take it
and dish it out.
</P>
<P>
   If Mr. Clinton can be impeached, shouldn't his dog Buddy worry,
too? We mean about impoochment?
</P>
<P>
   It seems as if Rep. J. Dennis Hastert will become House speaker
now. It must be comforting to him that he'll have small shoes to
fill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stand ready to use force again if Saddam takes threatening
action,'' Mr. Clinton says. Really. He said Saddam, not Ken Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have inflicted significant damage on Saddam's weapons of
mass destruction programs,'' says Mr. Clinton. And on Christiane
Amanpour's sleep schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Four Republican House members who voted to impeach Mr. Clinton
now say they prefer censure. Aren't you glad these folks aren't
executioners?
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important gifts we give are those that we give to
those who need it the most,'' the president says. That's why
someone should send the president a copy of ``Crime and
Punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   JFK's daughter Caroline says Mr. Clinton should be censured, not
removed from office. Censure, in this case, would be the slam-a-lot
option.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore says he hopes the Senate will ``be the voice of reason,
deliberation and healing that America needs.'' Won't we first have
to elect Dr. Laura?
</P>
<P>
   What the kids on Santa's lap are saying: ``If Rudolph gets in
trouble, please don't impeach him. Just censure him.''
</P>
<P>
   Before entering politics, Denny Hastert, soon to be House
speaker, was a wrestling coach. Does Washington really need a
leader now who knows how to put a full Nelson on someone?
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Republicans nationally are at a low ebb in
popularity. Given high ratings for the president, maybe they should
think about becoming the Grand Old Partyers.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department spokesman says ``it's only a matter of time''
until Saddam Hussein leaves power. Yes, but we can't think of a
leader of whom that's not true.
</P>
<P>
   The general who oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle
East says airstrikes in Iraq hit 85 percent of their targets.
That's about 10 times better than Ken Starr's staff did.
</P>
<P>
   A new poll shows about 60 percent of Americans say Christmas is
their favorite holiday. How could you vote? Yes, no and, uh,
present?

   Marvin Heffner and his wife, Anita, of Manakin-Sabot, Va., were
recently on a Shop Till You Drop bus trip to Manhattan. After doing
all the stores, Mrs. Heffner and a friend strolled on Fifth Avenue
and stopped in front of a Tiffany's window, where they stood beside

   The crowd was large and good-natured, the weather was balmy, and
Stanley Adelman was standing next to a large policeman, stern of
visage. A tall, gray-haired man came up to the officer and held out
his hand. ``I'm sorry for your loss,'' he said. ``We all cared for
Bobby Simone,'' he added, referring to the character that had been
played by Jimmy Smits on the television show.

   We had been waiting a long time, several of us lamenting the
dearth of M14 crosstown buses. When one finally arrived, it was
crowded. We settled into available seats, lowered our eyes and kept
our once talkative mouths shut. An eerie silence fell.
</P>
<P>
   After a few minutes, an announcement came over the loudspeaker:
``This is your bus driver. I apologize for the tardiness. This bus
has made 46 runs today, and now it only seems to make red lights.
Most of you are going home to your wives, husbands, children, pets
or other loved ones. I know you must be tired, frustrated, annoyed,
angry, hungry or thirsty. Let me offer you a suggestion. When you
leave the bus, hand me your bad feelings. When I get to the Hudson
River, I'll throw them in the water. Have a pleasant evening and a
nice ride.''
</P>
<P>
   People were reanimated. Talk among us resumed and passengers
left the bus smiling.

   Don Dellair was on an M104 bus seated next to two young Asian
women. One was telling the other a long story in Japanese. The
second woman continued nodding as her companion droned on,
seemingly interminably. After five or six minutes, she looked up.
``Whatever,'' she said.

   The box-office personnel at the 47th Street Theater Development
Fund TKTS booth were flummoxed recently when a woman asked for a
ticket to ``the Princess Di show.'' It took a minute for them to
decipher the request. She had seen an advertisement for ``Dinah
Was,'' the musical about Dinah Washington, and immediately made the
broad jump to British royalty. Diana/Dinah _ whatever.

</P>
<P>
   (Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star)
</P>
<P>
   Future generations of school children at least can be grateful
they won't have to memorize much about Bob Livingston Era.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, too, have proposed censuring Mr.
Clinton to end impeachment proceedings. For what he did, wouldn't
this set a vice precedent?
</P>
<P>
   Polls show most Americans think politics in Washington is out of
control. Odd. We didn't know that many folks were paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Invoking the solemn power of impeachment in the cause of
partisan politics is wrong,'' says Al Gore. But do two articles of
wrong make a right wing?
</P>
<P>
   Post-impeachment polls show nearly three out of four Americans
approve of how Mr. Clinton is doing his job. Yes, but we bet some
of those supporters are single men who hope he can introduce them
to Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The president spent part of this week volunteering in a soup
kitchen. The impeachment vote and this proves he can both take it
and dish it out.
</P>
<P>
   If Mr. Clinton can be impeached, shouldn't his dog Buddy worry,
too? We mean about impoochment?
</P>
<P>
   It seems as if Rep. J. Dennis Hastert will become House speaker
now. It must be comforting to him that he'll have small shoes to
fill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stand ready to use force again if Saddam takes threatening
action,'' Mr. Clinton says. Really. He said Saddam, not Ken Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have inflicted significant damage on Saddam's weapons of
mass destruction programs,'' says Mr. Clinton. And on Christiane
Amanpour's sleep schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Four Republican House members who voted to impeach Mr. Clinton
now say they prefer censure. Aren't you glad these folks aren't
executioners?
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important gifts we give are those that we give to
those who need it the most,'' the president says. That's why
someone should send the president a copy of ``Crime and
Punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   JFK's daughter Caroline says Mr. Clinton should be censured, not
removed from office. Censure, in this case, would be the slam-a-lot
option.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore says he hopes the Senate will ``be the voice of reason,
deliberation and healing that America needs.'' Won't we first have
to elect Dr. Laura?
</P>
<P>
   What the kids on Santa's lap are saying: ``If Rudolph gets in
trouble, please don't impeach him. Just censure him.''
</P>
<P>
   Before entering politics, Denny Hastert, soon to be House
speaker, was a wrestling coach. Does Washington really need a
leader now who knows how to put a full Nelson on someone?
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Republicans nationally are at a low ebb in
popularity. Given high ratings for the president, maybe they should
think about becoming the Grand Old Partyers.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department spokesman says ``it's only a matter of time''
until Saddam Hussein leaves power. Yes, but we can't think of a
leader of whom that's not true.
</P>
<P>
   The general who oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle
East says airstrikes in Iraq hit 85 percent of their targets.
That's about 10 times better than Ken Starr's staff did.
</P>
<P>
   A new poll shows about 60 percent of Americans say Christmas is
their favorite holiday. How could you vote? Yes, no and, uh,
present?

   After a few minutes, an announcement came over the loudspeaker:
``This is your bus driver. I apologize for the tardiness. This bus
has made 46 runs today, and now it only seems to make red lights.
Most of you are going home to your wives, husbands, children, pets
or other loved ones. I know you must be tired, frustrated, annoyed,
angry, hungry or thirsty. Let me offer you a suggestion. When you
leave the bus, hand me your bad feelings. When I get to the Hudson
River, I'll throw them in the water. Have a pleasant evening and a
nice ride.''
</P>
<P>
   People were reanimated. Talk among us resumed and passengers
left the bus smiling.

``Whatever,'' she said.

   The box-office personnel at the 47th Street Theater Development

decipher the request. She had seen an advertisement for ``Dinah
Was,'' the musical about Dinah Washington, and immediately made the
broad jump to British royalty. Diana/Dinah _ whatever.

   Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, too, have proposed censuring Mr.
Clinton to end impeachment proceedings. For what he did, wouldn't
this set a vice precedent?
</P>
<P>
   Polls show most Americans think politics in Washington is out of
control. Odd. We didn't know that many folks were paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Invoking the solemn power of impeachment in the cause of
partisan politics is wrong,'' says Al Gore. But do two articles of
wrong make a right wing?
</P>
<P>
   Post-impeachment polls show nearly three out of four Americans
approve of how Mr. Clinton is doing his job. Yes, but we bet some
of those supporters are single men who hope he can introduce them
to Monica Lewinsky.

<P>
   The president spent part of this week volunteering in a soup

   ``We stand ready to use force again if Saddam takes threatening
action,'' Mr. Clinton says. Really. He said Saddam, not Ken Starr.

   ``We have inflicted significant damage on Saddam's weapons of
mass destruction programs,'' says Mr. Clinton. And on Christiane
Amanpour's sleep schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Four Republican House members who voted to impeach Mr. Clinton
now say they prefer censure. Aren't you glad these folks aren't
executioners?
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important gifts we give are those that we give to
those who need it the most,'' the president says. That's why
someone should send the president a copy of ``Crime and
Punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   JFK's daughter Caroline says Mr. Clinton should be censured, not
removed from office. Censure, in this case, would be the slam-a-lot
option.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore says he hopes the Senate will ``be the voice of reason,
deliberation and healing that America needs.'' Won't we first have
to elect Dr. Laura?
</P>
<P>
   What the kids on Santa's lap are saying: ``If Rudolph gets in
trouble, please don't impeach him. Just censure him.''
</P>
<P>
   Before entering politics, Denny Hastert, soon to be House
speaker, was a wrestling coach. Does Washington really need a
leader now who knows how to put a full Nelson on someone?
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Republicans nationally are at a low ebb in
popularity. Given high ratings for the president, maybe they should
think about becoming the Grand Old Partyers.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department spokesman says ``it's only a matter of time''
until Saddam Hussein leaves power. Yes, but we can't think of a
leader of whom that's not true.

   The general who oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle
East says airstrikes in Iraq hit 85 percent of their targets.
That's about 10 times better than Ken Starr's staff did.

CLEMENS WITHDRAWS DEMAND FOR TRADE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roger Clemens, the elite pitcher who had demanded that the
Toronto Blue Jays trade him and then have his new team extend his
contract for huge dollars, backed off Tuesday, more or less.
</P>
<P>
   The only five-time winner of the Cy Young award had contended
that he had an oral agreement with the Blue Jays requiring them to
trade him if he felt they were not going to be pennant contenders.
But Tuesday, he withdrew his demand for a trade and said he would
report to spring training with the Blue Jays in February.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the 36-year-old pitcher also indicated he did
not want to play for Houston _ the team apparently most interested
in acquiring him _ because of his anger at Astros President Tal
Smith and General Manager Gerry Hunsicker.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hunsicker who called a news conference during baseball's
recent winter meetings to denounce Clemens' request for a $27.4
million one-year contract extension if the Astros acquired him in a
trade. Clemens was already due to be paid $8 million in 1998 and
$8.1 million in 1999, and Hunsicker termed the request for the
$27.4 million ``mind-boggling'' and said he was ``stunned and
really outraged.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith was not happy, either, and Tuesday Clemens answered back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very upset about what Smith and Hunsicker said and how
they directed things toward me as a person,'' the pitcher said
during a news conference that was held at the offices of his agents
in Houston, where Clemens lives. ``I don't know them personally,
and they don't know me as a person. The disappointment I feel is
that I have no interest in playing for two individuals like that
who would make a statement like that and don't know me.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens added: ``This is my community, my foundation is here. I
know at one point we were very close to getting something done. You
are disappointed, but you move on.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether Clemens truly shut the door on the Astros on Tuesday
and truly committed himself to remaining with the Blue Jays remains
to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens' agents, Randy and Alan Hendricks, would not rule out a
future deal with the Astros, even though they complained that
Hunsicker's comments had made Clemens appear to be a greedy player,
which was indeed the consensus that began to emerge in the baseball
world.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Randy Hendricks praised Astros' owner Drayton
McLane for being ``diligent and courteous'' in his pursuit of
Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto General Manager Gord Ash, who had been trying to find
someone willing to deal for Clemens and then give him additional
money, took the whole day's events in stride and said he would
probably try to resume Clemens trade talks after Christmas.

AMERICAN BASKETBALL LEAGUE, UNABLE MATCH POWER OF THE NBA, FOLDS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)   By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   They snuck in and nabbed the majority of gold-medal players
fresh off the 1996 Olympic podium and handed out six-figure
salaries for their stars. They savored the coup of being the first
to capitalize on women's basketball as it hit the pop chart and
defied gravity by launching a dunk contest.
</P>
<P>
   But for all their muscle and skill and daring, the American
Basketball League was marketed with Polaroids and magic markers
next to the glossy product the Women's National Basketball
Association put on as summertime family entertainment. The ABL
flailed for attention, corporate dollars and television deals until
its money ran out. Deep in debt, the ABL folded Tuesday one-third
of the way through its third season and announced that it will file
for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league is out of money,'' ABL co-founder Gary Cavalli said
in a statement. ``While this was an extremely painful decision, we
had no choice but to shut down. Ultimately, we exhausted every
option and pursued every lead, but could not generate the revenues
or financing necessary to sustain operations. And our lack of
television had a lot to do with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``TV exposure is critical to sponsors, licensees and investors.
This year, we offered millions of dollars to the TV networks for
air time, but couldn't obtain adequate coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became clear that, although we had the best product, we
could not find enough people willing to confront the NBA and give
us the major sponsorships and TV contracts we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA posed too ominous a mountain for the little engine
pushing the ABL. Now, the NBA-backed WNBA, which would never
entertain merging with the ABL, will likely capitalize from the
fall of the league. Although some players, including the star Dawn
Staley, recently defected to the WNBA, many argued that the best
players _ like Jen Rizzotti of the New England Blizzard _ were
still on the rosters of the ABL.
</P>
<P>
   Along with college players like Tennessee's Chamique Holdsclaw _
who has no American option but to play in the WNBA _ the elite ABL
players could end up lifting the level of the WNBA via free agency
or a draft pool although there was no clear answer on these issues
Tuesday. WNBA officials said it was too premature to determine what
will happen. And Cavalli, declining to comment on the advice of
legal counsel, was limited to his released statement and the
information provided on a telephone recording at the league's
headquarters in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   There were hints of problems in the ABL, with a franchise in
Long Beach, Calif., folding last month. But there was no
foreshadowing to indicate a league near doom. As the day unfolded,
shocked players listened to a recorded message telling them that
the league is working on a plan to pay players ``as much as
possible for the month of December.''
</P>
<P>
   Just Tuesday morning, the coach of the New England Blizzard,
K.C. Jones, was watching film in his office in Hartford around 2
p.m. when he received a call from the league's player personnel
director, Tracey Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call from Tracey saying that the league was closing
down,'' said Jones, whose Blizzard team road the coattails of
UConn's popularity and drew a league-high average crowd of 7,000
with fan favorites Rizzotti and Kara Wolters on the team. ``It was
a shocker.''
</P>
<P>
   Most believed the ABL had a chance to survive for another year,
but the league could not find a way to use the NBA's six-month old
lockout to its advantage. It was never viewed as an alternative to
the void left by the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the NBA lockout, the ABL still has been unable to buy
TV time,'' Cavalli stated.
</P>
<P>
   It was a grim way to end for the enthusiastic Cavalli. The ABL
came onto the scene as an unpolished but scrappy league that
intended to use its good timing to attract attention and find
momentum. A year earlier, the UConn women's basketball program,
complete with its wholesome appeal and loyal fans, helped catapult
the game onto the national landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the Olympics. With exposure courtesy of the NBA's
marketing machine, the women were thrust into the mainstream as
national darlings who captured audiences on their way to a
feel-good gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the ABL pounced on the game, sneaking onto the court
ahead of the NBA-backed WNBA. It was clear the NBA had nothing but
disdain for the ABL and thought of it as second-class rivals.
</P>
<P>
   But the WNBA never sweated the ABL's existence. While the
nine-team ABL was a winter league lost in the fray of college
basketball and saddled with an average attendance of 4,333 fans,
the WNBA was soaring in merchandise sales as an average of 10,869
people filled NBA arenas in the summer. While only spare television
coverage from Fox Sports Net and BET put the league into
households, the WNBA had deals with NBC, Lifetime and ESPN to
televise several games a week.
</P>
<P>
   The ABL did not have glamour as a lure for players, so it
reached deep _ perhaps too deep _ into its pockets to land talent
with high salaries. Last year, Kate Starbird, a star from Stanford,
opted for the ABL after Portland dangled a $150,000 salary in front
of her.
</P>
<P>
   Starbird and Wolters, also paid $150,000 a year, were the
top-paid players. Others faired well, too, tapping into the
league's disappearing well for an average salary of $80,000 for a
five-month season. Meanwhile, the WNBA could offer more endorsement
opportunities but only a $40,000 average for a shorter, six-week
season.
</P>
<P>
   More than cash, the WNBA had much more promise than the ABL from
the start. As much as the WNBA shoved the ABL aside _ and likely
pushed it toward a collapse with its hold on the market _ the
league was not publicly gloating Tuesday. It took a more diplomatic
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unfortunate setback for the women's sports
movement,'' WNBA commissioner Val Ackerman said in a statement.
``We applaud the efforts and passion of the ABL players and all the
league personnel that labored so hard to sustain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the ABL's basement-like operations were no match for
the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are proud of what we accomplished as a pioneer in women's
professional sports,'' Cavalli said. ``We put a great product on
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave it our best shot; we fought the good fight, and we had
a good run.''

ABL WAS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TOO SHORT, WITH NO NETWORK AT THE DOOR
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The failure of the American Basketball League was foretold
almost from the beginning: it never had enough money, investors,
marketing or television exposure to compete with the better
capitalized Women's NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, the league is out of money,'' Gary Cavalli, the
co-founder and chief executive of the ABL, said in a statement
posted Tuesday on the league's Web site. The league's board of
directors made its decision last week.
</P>
<P>
   The ABL joins other nonsurvivors like the World Football League
and the United States Football League, the North American Soccer
League, the Major Indoor Soccer League and the United Baseball
League, which hoped to challenge Major League Baseball but was
never launched.
</P>
<P>
   It is never easy to start a new league and even harder to keep
one going. The ABL made it one-third through its third season, but
the marketing power of the Women's National Basketball Association
and the failure to get a major television contract doomed it. To
gain a broadcast deal with CBS Sports (two games) and a cable deal
with Fox Sports Net (16 games), the ABL had to pay the networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year we offered millions of dollars to the TV networks
for air time, but couldn't obtain adequate coverage,'' Cavalli
said. ``During the NBA lockout, the ABL still has been unable to
buy TV time.''
</P>
<P>
   The ABL began operations in 1996, with games carried by the
Sportschannel regional networks (now part of Fox Sports Net) and
the BET network. In the second season, 36 games were carried by Fox
Sports Net and BET.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the WNBA was shepherded onto NBC, ESPN, ESPN2 and
Lifetime, and was launched with the sort of fanfare associated with
the marketing-oriented NBA, which owns it. All WNBA teams play
during the summer in NBA arenas, while the ABL played in the fall
and winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame,'' said Vince Wladika, a Fox spokesman. ``The ABL
provided us with high-quality women's programming, both nationally
and regionally.''
</P>
<P>
   The ABL was also hamstrung by limited national sponsorship; only
Reebok and the Phoenix Home Life Insurance Co. were enlisted over
the three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Most leagues begin with high hopes, as the ABL did, but run up
against reality. The league said it planned to file for Chapter 11
bankruptcy.

</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - GROWING A BUSINESS   Scout Your Competition Honestly 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Q: I am starting a new business and want to check out the &LR; 
 &UR; competition. Any suggestions? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Your first impulse might be to pose as a customer to get prices
and wheedle other information out of a competitor. But San
Francisco business consultant Paul Terry suggests that it's best to
be straightforward, not sneaky.
</P>
<P>
   This approach, he suggests, is designed to open a dialogue and
develop a collegial relationship with the competing business owner.
``Most of the time they will cooperate if they don't feel
threatened by you,'' he said. ``In the consulting business, for
example, you might suggest collaborating or giving them business
overflow and vice versa.''
</P>
<P>
   Flattery can often yield useful information. At the very least,
be tactful. That might mean seeking general information about such
matters as the best selling season or their preference of vendors.
Instead of specific questions about the cost of materials or
pricing information, you might ask about annual sales growth or
profit margins in percentage terms rather than in dollars.
</P>
<P>
   To make yourself less threatening, consider calling or visiting
competitors in nearby cities or similar regions.
</P>
<P>
   You also can get a lot of information from just observation. For
example, if you plan to open a restaurant, Terry suggests dining at
places that are similar in concept. Note the number of tables,
customer traffic and turnover, what they order and typical prices,
number of employees, size of restaurant and location. From this
information you can probably estimate revenues and expenses to
arrive at a rough approximation of profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Besides studying competitors directly, Terry advises doing
plenty of secondary research. Check out information in the library
and on the Web. Attend industry meetings, join professional
associations and scour trade publications, which often detail
business trends and provide data on profit margins, sales per
square foot and other ratios.
</P>
<P>
   Do not step over the ethical and legal line by going through a
competitor's trash looking for invoices and other inside
information. And do not pose as someone you are not, like a student
working on an MBA research project. That can land you in court or
jail. With corporate spying on the rise, Congress approved the
Economic Espionage Act two years ago. There also have been dozens
of civil suits and prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Q: What is the best way to extract money from customers who don't &LR; 
 &UR; pay on time? This seems to be a particular problem after the &LR; 
 &UR; Christmas shopping season. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; A: Begin your collection effort on the first day the money is
past due, recommends Deborah Jacobs, author of ``Small Business
Legal Smarts'' (Bloomberg Press, $16.95). Start with a phone call
indicating payment is late and determine whether there was any
problem with your product or service. Ask when you can expect to be
paid and follow up with another call in 10 days or two weeks if
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs offers these additional do's and don'ts when dealing with
deadbeats:
</P>
<P>
   _Don't harass. Don't call repeatedly or let the phone ring
incessantly. Never use insulting, sarcastic or obscene language.
Restrict your calls to the office when collecting from a business
unless the party consistently ignores your calls and messages. And
if you contact people at home, do so during reasonable hours (8
a.m. to 9 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   _If calls don't work, send certified letters with an urgent
demand for payment. Send three or four letters at regular intervals
over several months. The letters can be used as evidence of your
collection effort. Specify the merchandise or service you haven't
been paid for, sum owed, and date the obligations were fulfilled.
Mention phone calls when the customer acknowledged debt and
promised to pay. Later letters can be more forceful. For example,
you can list steps you are prepared to take, such as turning over
account to collection agency.
</P>
<P>
   _Don't use deceptive tactics. Don't impersonate lawyer or debt
collector or send documents simulating court papers or letters that
look like telegrams.
</P>
<P>
   _Conduct yourself in a businesslike manner. As angry as you may
be, don't take it personally, and don't let it show.
</P>
<P>
   _Don't take legal action until you evaluate if it's worth it.
Going to a lawyer or small claims court may be your only recourse,
but first determine what the debt is worth. Your time, energy and
money might be better spent generating new business.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Q: Can you define the concept of ``goodwill'' and explain what &LR; 
 &UR; sort of value I should place on it in buying a business? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: Unlike plant, property and equipment, goodwill doesn't
show up on most company balance sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes known as ``name brand recognition,'' goodwill includes
the the value of a company's reputation and its customer and
business relationships, said financial consultant and author Eric
Tyson (``Small Business for Dummies,'' IDG Books, $19.99).
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy to put a price tag on such ``intangible'' assets
in this situation, which usually arises when a business is being
acquired. If a company has a net worth (assets minus liabilities)
of $2 million and the purchase price is $3 million, the extra $1
million is considered goodwill. This goodwill then becomes an
asset, says  &LR; Tyson said, which like equipment can be depreciated
(or amortized) over time.
</P>
<P>
   There is no simple business barometer to figure the value of a
company's goodwill. Tyson recommends assessing the company's
customer and supplier relationships as well as the balance sheet
and checking out the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like buying a house, you have to look at comparables,''
he said. ``There's no magic formula but try to find out what
companies in the same or similar industries are selling for.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that real estate transactions are a matter of
public record while small-business sales are not. However, there
are plenty of consultants, appraisers and publications that can
assist you in your analysis. Check out the following:

3COM'S EARNINGS REPORT BEATS EXPECTATIONS  &HT;     BY DEBORAH SOLOMON
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON -3COM   &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Networking giant 3Com Corp. reported higher than expected quarterly
earnings yesterday based on strong sales of PalmPilots, switches
and other networking gear.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Clara company reported second quarter earnings of
$132.9 million (36 cents per share), compared to net income of
$4.0 &LR;  million, (1 cent) in the same quarter of last year. The
company barely beat estimates of Wall Street analysts, who had
expected earnings of between 34 cents and 35 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for 3Com, which makes products that run computer
networks, increased 29 percent to $1.54 billion, up from $1.2
billion in the second quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Benhamou, 3Com's chairman and chief executive, said the
higher earnings were a result of strong sales across most of the
company's product lines. While the popular PalmPilot was again the
highest growth product, Benhamou said sales of other products, such
as modems, also grew in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growth this quarter was very broad-based,'' Benhamou said.
``We had more growth from switching products, modems grew faster
than networking interface cards and overall we had a more
homogenous growth profile.''
</P>
<P>
   Benhamou said he expects 3Com to grow in 1999 through new
partnership agreements, as well as increased demand for 3Com's home
networking, wireless connectivity and voice-over-internet products.
</P>
<P>
   ``While 3Com is substantially stronger operationally, we know we
are still far below our potential,'' Benhamou said. He predicted a
slowdown in sales for the third quarter, however, because that's
when 3Com traditionally experiences its slowest growth.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were impressed with 3Com's earnings, saying the company
exceeded most estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their earnings were amazing,'' said Scott Heritage, an analyst
with Warburg Dillon Read LLC in New York. ``What was most
surprising was how strong their gross margins were.'' Heritage said
the company far surpassed his estimate of 28 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   The networking industry is expected to grow about 14 percent in
1999 and is attracting more players every year. 3Com faces an
aggressive challenge from other companies such as Cisco Systems,
Lucent Technologies and Nortel Networks.
</P>
<P>
   3Com beat out one rival, I &LR; ntel Corp., &LR;  yesterday in a bid to
supply network interface cards to Hewlett-Packard Co.'s entire line
of personal computers. The cards connect computers to the Internet
and officials with 3Com said the agreement will boost the company's
55 percent share of the network interface card NIC &LR;   &LR; market.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Claflin, 3Com's president and chief operating officer,
said the company would continue to defend its turf with new
products, an aggressive investment strategy and more research and
development in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will begin to see more of an aggressiveness to our
investment strategy,'' Claflin said. ``Our gross margins have
improved and are stable so we're now going to spend more money in
research and development to grow our top lines.'' He mentioned Palm
products and home networking as two areas where 3Com plans to
concentrate its efforts.

ANOTHER TOP BOFA EXECUTIVE MAY QUIT  &HT;     BY SAM ZUCKERMAN
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - BOFA   &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The new BankAmerica is soon likely to lose one of the few
top-ranking executives left from San Francisco's old BofA.
</P>
<P>
   Michael O'Neill, the highly regarded president of the new bank's
asset management and investment operations, is a finalist for a
senior post at a major financial institution and could quit as
early as March, bank insiders and people close to the bank said.
Reached by telephone, O'Neill declined to identify the institution
or comment on his status.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the job falls through, O'Neill, 52, will probably leave
BofA within a few months. People close to him said he feels he
doesn't fit into the close-knit culture of the new bank's top
leaders and has other job opportunities available to him.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the new BofA's senior executives come from North
Carolina's NationsBank, which bought the old BofA three months ago
and took its name.
</P>
<P>
   If he left, On leaving,  &LR; O'Neill could would be able to &LR; 
 &LR; collect a golden parachute package that provides providing &LR;   &LR; three
years of salary and bonuses, stock and other benefits. The package,
triggered by NationsBank's purchase of the old BofA, would be worth
tens of millions of dollars over time.
</P>
<P>
   The exact timing of O'Neill's departure will depend on how soon
he finds a suitable position, people close to him said.
</P>
<P>
   Executive recruiters said O'Neill is capable of running a large
financial institution.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``He comes up on the radar screens of senior executive
recruiters across the country,'' said John Wilson, a San Francisco
partner with the search firm Korn/Ferry International.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's someone who could rise to the CEO spot of a moderate- &LR; 
to- &LR;  large institution very easily. He's smart and capable _ I've
only heard good things about him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike has no current plans to leave the bank,'' BofA spokesman
John Keane said. ``If he is interviewing, it is not a process he
initiated.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of BOFA23 (33519 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The departure of O'Neill would further solidify NationsBank's
control of the combined bank, underscoring that the combination of
the two institutions was a corporate takeover, not a merger of
equals, as originally advertised.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of high- ranking executives from the old BofA have jumped
ship as NationsBank put its own people in key positions.
</P>
<P>
   At the old BofA, O'Neill held the critical post of vice chairman
and chief financial officer, making him the bank's most powerful
figure after Chairman and Chief Executive Officer David Coulter.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank tapped O'Neill him  &LR; as one of three old BofA
executives to sit on the combined bank's six-member policy
committee, the bank's highest executive decision-making body.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hugh McColl
forced Coulter out in October, three weeks after the acquisition
was finalized, blaming him for risky trading and investment
strategies that resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in
losses.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill's resignation would leave just one veteran of the old
BofA among the top executives of the new bank: Michael Murray, 54,
president of the bank's worldwide corporate and investment banking
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Both O'Neill and Murray were themselves relative newcomers at
the old BofA. They joined the San Francisco bank in 1994 when BofA
bought Chicago's Continental Bank. O'Neill had been chief financial
officer and Murray corporate banking chief of Continental.

LIVER SPECIALIST TO LEAVE BOSTON HOSPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM AND RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Less than two weeks after a team of surgeons performed
New England's first adult-to-adult liver transplant involving
living donors at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, the leader
of that team plans to leave the Boston hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The move by Dr. Roger Jenkins, confirmed Tuesday by Beth Israel
Deaconess officials, is the latest in a string of high profile
departures that have rocked the teaching hospital in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Three surgeons resigned from Beth Israel Deaconess &UR;  &LR; two weeks
ago. And earlier this year, a group of anesthesiologists left to
form an independent practice.
</P>
<P>
   While other members of Beth Israel Deaconess' transplant team,
which includes three other physicians, did not comment on whether
they would also resign, health care observers note that transplant
groups tend to be extremely cohesive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's certainly pressure for the team to move together,''
said Stephen Weiner, a health care attorney at Mintz Levin Cohn
Ferris Glovsky &AMP; Popeo in Boston. ``It's not easy for somebody to
replicate a whole new team.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins was performing surgery Tuesday and could not be reached
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been informed that Dr. Roger Jenkins, chief of
transplantation, has decided to accept an opportunity at another
hospital and will be leaving the medical center,'' said Antony
Swartz Lloyd, senior vice president of Beth Israel Deaconess.
</P>
<P>
   Swartz Lloyd would not say when Jenkins will leave Beth Israel
Deaconess or where he will go.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of hospitals in the country perform liver
transplants, which are considered to be one of medicine's most
complex procedures. In New England, liver transplants are performed
by a consortium of centers that includes Beth Israel Deaconess,
Massachusetts General Hospital, Children's Hospital, New England
Medical Center, UMass-Memorial Medical Center, and Yale-New Haven
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   In October, dissatisfaction among the transplant surgeons
prompted a series of meetings with Dr. Mitchell P. Fink, chief of
surgery at Beth Israel Deaconess. Sources said the meetings did not
resolve differences between Jenkins and Fink over who would
ultimately lead the department of surgery. Industry observers say
the power struggle between Jenkins and Fink is just one among many
resulting from a 1996 merger between Beth Israel and Deaconess
hospitals. Under the merger, departments were forced to combine,
leading to shifts of authority with long-lasting effects.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anthony P. Monaco, director of the Beth Israel Deaconess'
transplant center and Jenkins' supervisor, tried to downplay the
effect of his departure on the institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a superb transplantation service that has developed
its reputation over the years because of the many surgeons who have
served here,'' Monaco said. ``It will not rise or fall because of
any individual or individuals at a particular point in time.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month the Beth Israel Deaconess program made news
when it carried out the first transplants in New England in which a
living adult donor gave part of a liver to an adult recipient.
Those two transplants went well, and made Beth Israel Deaconess one
of only a handful of programs in the country offering the surgery,
which has been gaining ground because far too few livers are
donated by brain-dead patients to fill the demand.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, there were 121 liver transplants in the region served
by the New England Organ Bank, which includes all or part of the
six New England states. Currently, there are 900 people waiting for
livers in hospitals in the NEOB's area, a spokeswoman said. A total
of 163 livers were recovered from donors, with those not implanted
locally being sent outside the region.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,000 liver transplants are performed annually in the
United States at a cost of about $500,000 each for the surgery and
the first year of treatment. The five-year survival rate following
a liver transplant is about 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The liver, the body's largest organ, has hundreds of functions
including converting food to energy, regulating the breakdown of
food nutrients, producing clotting factors for the blood, and
eliminating toxic substances.
</P>
<P>
   Most liver transplants in children are needed because of a
congenital abnormality. In adults, most transplants currently are
done in patients whose own organ has been damaged by hepatitis C.
Because of the large number of people infected with hepatitis C who
are yet to become seriously ill, the need for donor livers is
expected to grow substantially in the next few decades.
</P>
<P>
   A liver transplant requires a large team of surgeons,
hepatologists (physicians who specialize in liver diseases),
nurses, and psychiatric specialists, among others.
</P>
<P>
   The transplant team at Beth Israel Deaconess includes three
surgeons, a hepatologist and two nurses. Drs. Elizabeth Pomfret and
David Lewis, surgeons on the team, did not return calls Tuesday
seeking comment. Dr. Fred Gordon, the team's hepatologist, also did
not respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not been informed that any other transplant surgeons
plan to leave,'' said Swartz Lloyd, Beth Israel Deaconess'
spokesman.

TWO BRUINS FIND HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA freshman forward Jerome Moiso joked last week
that he and center Dan Gadzuric would spend Christmas sleeping on
the streets of Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   Although they'll celebrate with a warm bed and good meal _
courtesy of teammate Todd Ramasar _ Moiso and Gadzuric will be
thousands of miles from home during the Christmas break.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso is a native of Guadeloupe, in the Caribbean. Gadzuric is
from Holland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected this to happen, but it's still tough,'' Gadzuric
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really mind,'' Moiso added. ``I'm used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moiso was educated in France and Milford (Conn.) Academy and
hasn't been home for Christmas in years. Gadzuric did go home for
the holidays while attending Gov. Dummer Academy in Byfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for those guys, they're a long way from home,''
said Ramasar, a Riverside native who also entertained the Bruins
for Thanksgiving. ``I'll take them shopping and show them around
Riverside. But Jerome told me he wants to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Working his way back: Back strengthening exercises and extra
shooting before practice have helped freshman forward JaRon Rush
regain his preseason form.
</P>
<P>
   Rush hit 2 of 3 3-point shots against Cal State Northridge and
has made 11 of 21 field goals in the past two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``My back's fine, and I'm feeling good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Uniforms update: Coach Steve Lavin said there's been a dramatic
change in the response to UCLA's black uniforms: for the past three
weeks, the mail has been positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``What surprised me was how grim and grave people were,'' Lavin
said of the initial outrage. ``I kid people that Ted Koppel was
going to do a town-hall meeting about it.... If every decision I
make is based on what coach (John) Wooden thinks, or what (former
Bruin) Mike Warren thinks, I'd be paralyzed.''
</P>
<P>
   Wooden and Warren criticized the black uniforms after their
debut against Maryland on Nov. 27, but Lavin said Wooden recently
called and apologized.
</P>
<P>
   Still sputtering: Young teams often struggle with consistency,
and the Bruins are no exception. They played well for the first
five minutes and the final 13 minutes against Nevada-Las Vegas. And
they played well in the final 10 minutes of the first half against
CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like a quarter-horse,'' forward Rico Hines said. ``We're
good for a half. Sometimes, we look like All-Americans for
stretches. It's a mental thing. We have to learn to put people
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight and day: Sophomore guard Billy Knight thought his nagging
groin injury had healed enough for him to play last week against
CSUN. Then he felt a twinge in warmups and decided rest was best.
</P>
<P>
   Because he played in the exhibition games, Knight would have to
apply for a medical redshirt if he choose to sit out the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say it takes six or eight months to heal, and I've had it
since June,'' said Knight, who described the injury as a cartilage
problem resulting from the strain of offseason running.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's six months of trying to play through it. Unless I
can get back in the next couple weeks, it doesn't make any sense to
try to play in February.''

SAN FRANCISCO GROUP TRAINS PEOPLE TO RUN BUSINESSES  &HT;     BY PETER SINTON 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - RENAISSANCE   &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Kimbyl Edwards, owner of Zen Again Productions, got the idea for
her indoor fountain business during the last California drought
when she hooked up a little pump to transport used bath water to
her garden.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime biker Hal Heller decided to buy a motorcycle safety
training school that was on the financial skids after observing it
for 16 years as a part-time instructor.
</P>
<P>
   Whether sudden flash or long simmer, the inspiration to become
an entrepreneur is often the easy part. The hard part is turning
the vision into a business plan and the plan into a successful
product or service.
</P>
<P>
   Many entrepreneurs learn the ropes at someone else's company or
try the trial and error route. Others spend years and thousands (or
tens of thousands) of dollars getting a master's degree in business
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards and Heller, who are both 42, chose another path. They
took a crash course in business planning offered by San Francisco's
Renaissance Entrepreneurship Center at 275 Fifth St. cq &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Since 1987, about 1,000 people have graduated from Renaissance
training programs, about half of them business owners and half of
them aspiring entrepreneurs. Claudia Viek, executive director of
the 275 Mission Street  &LR; nonprofit organization, measures success
not just by testimonials but the fact that 85 percent of graduates
who have businesses are still operating after four years.
</P>
<P>
   When friends of Edwards recommended that she apply for the
14-week program, she said, ``I thought I knew everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Since running away from home in the San Joaquin Valley town of
Ceres at the age of 16, Edwards was used to acting on impulse.
After learning paper making and a stint driving a pickup truck for
Sunset Scavenger, she got into making lamps with hand-crafted
papers. Then in 1993, she designed a mini- &LR; fountain using
pint-sized pumps, copper tubing and piles of pebbles and slate.
</P>
<P>
   There was a great reception for the fountains, which wholesale
for $49 to $107. Edwards ended her first year with sales of $13,000
a month. But after taking the Renaissance course, Edwards realized
realizes  &LR; that her early know-it-all stance ``was the height of
insanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking the course was ``very humbling,'' she said. says.  &LR; But it
also gave her essential information about reading financial
reports, understanding product placement, identifying the
competition, listening to the customer and other key business
concepts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Renaissance program is not book learning; it's not
theoretical,'' Edwards said. ``It's hands-on and that's the way I
learn. They bring in bankers to explain loans, real estate people
to explain leases, accountants to explain book- &LR; keeping and
demystify the terminology.''
</P>
<P>
   Zen Again now has 30 employees, more than 1,000 retail
customers, including Gump's, Nordstrom, Dayton-Hudson and the
Chicago Art Institute. and  &LR; Zen sells more than 20,000 fountains
and 4,000 lamps a year. Annual sales top $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Heller was not hit by an idea for a nifty new product but a
way to do things better.
</P>
<P>
   Like many entrepreneurs, Heller got tired of working for someone
else. After years repairing sophisticated blood analysis equipment
for a big company, he started his own laser printer repair business
and took the business planning course at Renaissance in 1991. But
his true love was cycling and in 1994, when the owner of Bay Area
Motorcycle Training was dying, Heller agreed to buy the San
Francisco business even though it was losing $17,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, the operation is running smoothly. Heller
expanded the training to Napa, more than doubled the number of
students from 800 to nearly 2,000 a year and revved up revenues
from $120,000 to $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   After expenses, Heller nets about $40,000, which is not a
fortune. But he said, says,  &LR; ``Working with motorcycles is
wonderful. How many people get to make a living doing what they
love?''
</P>
<P>
   He also has the time and energy to have a marketing consulting
business on the side and stays involved with Renaissance, where he
helps judge student business plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Renaissance taught me how to be an entrepreneur,'' says &LR; 
 &LR; Heller said. ``By taking the course, I was able to eliminate most
of the mistakes in operating a business.''
</P>
<P>
   He started by streamlining the business to cut costs. This meant
focusing on saving big money, not pennies. He stopped requiring
applicants for the training program to send in stamped,
self-addressed envelopes and instead simplified the paper flow.
Heller also moved the office from a warehouse to his home and
rented a shipping container to store the motorcycles at the
training site rather than hauling them across town to and from
lessons by trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Adopting Renaissance tips about ``relationship marketing,''
Heller placed brochures in motorcycle shops, insurance agencies and
the Department of Motor Vehicles, which requires that everyone
under the age of 21 take a training program before they get a
license to drive motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we teach more people to ride,'' Heller reasoned, ``you sell
more bikes, insurance and people ride safely.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Renaissance Programs
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many MBA programs, which focus on the academic and
arcane, Renaissance offers practical instruction including writing
a business plan, pricing your product and knowing when you can go
to a bank for a loan, and when you can't. ``Some have called our
courses a mini-MBA,'' said  &LR; Viek said.
</P>
<P>
   Renaissance offers three courses:
</P>
<P>
   _``Introduction to Business'' is an eight-week class designed to
help develop the personal and business skills needed to start a
business.
</P>
<P>
   _``Business Planning'' is a 14-week (85-hour) program that helps
100 students a year create a practical, effective business plan.
</P>
<P>
   _``Advanced Business Action Plan'' is a 10-week class designed
to help aimed at helping  &LR; those who are already in business explore
new markets, add staff and grow their companies.
</P>
<P>
   Renaissance charges an application fee of $25 for its extremely
 &LR; popular courses and gives priority to San Francisco &LR;   &LR; minorities,
women, and low- to moderate-income residents of San Francisco. The
real cost of its its business planning course is $3,000, but thanks
to financing from the San Francisco Mayor's Office of Economic
Development and private companies and foundations, it charges
students $100 to $500 based on their income.
</P>
<P>
   The courses are taught by those who run their own businesses and
experts from different fields. San Francisco small-business
consultant Paul Terry, who designed the curriculum, said says &LR; 
 &LR; drafting a business plan is crucial to success. It includes
defining the business, its products and services, the target
market, sales strategy, competitive advantages and distinctions,
management and operations, start-up and expansion costs, growth
plans and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, at the final three-hour evening class of the latest
Business Planning course last week &LR; , each of Terry's 30 students
talked excitedly about their business plans and shared what they
learned in the previous three months.
</P>
<P>
   Ruta Kahate said that she decided to test her recipes and
business skills by starting a catering business before opening a
costly Indian restaurant. ``Everyone has big dreams but it doesn't
hurt to start small,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Aungst, who runs Romaine Photography, said the course
helped her calculate her break-even point and assess her
competitive advantage. ``I will go anywhere to take a photo,'' she
said. ``Most people would charge extra.''
</P>
<P>
   Waheed Ghilzai said the course and discussions with his teachers
and classmates provided important tips for commercializing his
invention _ an orthopedic back support system for mechanics who
spend their days leaning over car engines.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its oversubscribed  &LR; courses, Renaissance offers
an office space incubator to select micro-businesses, a support
network of graduates and a financing resource center.
</P>
<P>
   Several other organizations in the Bay Area provide similar
assistance to budding entrepreneurs:

INSOLVENCY FORCES ABL TO FOLD IN ITS 3D SEASON 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   ``I think the ABL is all about hopes and dreams and
opportunities,'' said Gary Cavalli, a founder and chief executive
officer of the American Basketball League, as the new women's
league began in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. It also needed to be about TV contracts and gate
receipts and deep pockets. Tuesday, just one-third of the way into
its third season, the league _ which included the popular New
England Blizzard _ abruptly folded.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, the league is out of money,'' Cavalli said in a
statement. The league plans to file for protection under Chapter 11
of the federal bankruptcy laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am shocked,'' said a stunned Jennifer Rizzotti, a key player
for the Blizzard since the league's inception. ``I never saw it
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA, which has loomed as a threat to the ABL's survival,
thus becomes the only women's professional basketball league.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sad day for our fans, employees, players, and
coaches, and for women's basketball in general,'' Cavalli's
statement continued. ``We are proud of what we accomplished as a
pioneer in women's professional athletics. . . . We gave it our
best shot; we fought the good fight, and we had a good run.''
</P>
<P>
   The league office in Palo Alto, Calif., simply had a recorded
message saying they had ``closed our entire operation and suspended
the 1998-1999 game schedule.'' Spokespeople did not return phone
calls. Players and staff reportedly would be paid through the end
of this month.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA offered a statement calling the demise ``an unfortunate
setback for the women's sports movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Val Ackerman, president of the WNBA, said in the statement: ``We
applaud the great effort and passion of the ABL players and all the
league and team personnel who labored so hard to start and sustain
the league.''
</P>
<P>
   The New England Blizzard, which settled in Hartford, conn.
full-time this fall after two seasons in which it played some of
its home games in Springfield, Mass., led the league in attendance
from the outset. Of the top 10 crowds in league history, seven were
logged at the Hartford Civic Center, including the largest ever of
15,418.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, an average of 10,400 fans turned out for the 16
Hartford games. In its eight home games this season, in which the
team was 3-10 overall, the Blizzard had averaged 7,330.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am thankful for all of the loyal fans throughout this trying
season,'' said Rizzotti. ``It's a shame this happened. I'm still
trying to figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Hartford, the league included teams in Chicago,
Columbus, Nashville, Philadelphia, Portland, San Jose, and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The Blizzard did manage to win their last game, a dramatic
come-from-behind victory last Saturday over the Nashville Noise in
Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Blizzard spokesman Steve Raczynski said the league's general
managers were informed of the decision, made late Monday night, at
about 1 p.m. Tuesday, and the rest of the Blizzard staff was told
in midafternoon that they were out of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had had any inkling of the league's demise, he
replied: ``None. None whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Pam Batalis, who became ABL vice president for marketing this
year after two seasons as Blizzards' GM, was still reeling, hours
after learning of the league's shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``After committing every ounce of energy, blood, sweat, and
tears over the past two years . . . just to have it be over is just
a shock,'' she said. ``I'm trying to challenge everyone to try to
realize and be proud of what we accomplished. We have significantly
contributed to women's sports history.''
</P>
<P>
   Although full operations will cease and telephone lines will be
disconnected by the end of Wednesday, Batalis encouraged fans
holding tickets to ``just sort of sit tight'' for information on
refunds.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Cavalli laid much of the blame on the lack of
TV exposure. ``Ultimately, we exhausted every option and pursued
every lead, but could not generate the revenues or financing
necessary to sustain operations,'' he said. ``And our lack of
television had a lot to do with that.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, only 14 of the ABL's 44 games were scheduled to be
televised on Fox Sports Network _ half as many as were shown last
season _ with two playoff games on CBS. The WNBA played only a
30-game schedule in the summer, but had contracts with NBC, ESPN,
and Lifetime that regularly broadcast three games a week.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the ABL should have been riding high this season
with the NBA out of action.
</P>
<P>
   As the season was about to begin, Cavalli said, ``We're going to
try to exploit what we have in front of us, to remind people that
while the NBA isn't playing, there is still an opportunity to come
out and sample.''
</P>
<P>
   But the rivalry with the WNBA was always a constant. Although
most of the 1996 Olympians went with the ABL (which several had
been instrumental in organizing), marquee players Sheryl Swoopes,
Lisa Leslie, and Rebecca Lobo opted for the WNBA. Dawn Staley, one
of the ABL's founders, last fall announced that she was leaving for
the rival league after two years with the Philadelphia Rage.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, Brian Agler _ whose Columbus Quest won titles
in both years of the league's existence _ and assistant Kelly
Kramer left to lead the Minnesota Lynx, a WNBA expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they had a clue of what was to come.

MERCHANTS TAKING TARNISH OFF TINSELTOWN   STREETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Much like an actor getting a makeover after falling
off the A-list, Hollywood is rebuilding its glamour after decades
of decline.
</P>
<P>
   Property values and rental rates have been surging with gains of
as much as 40 percent over the year; developers are flocking to the
area; and a key national player is building a $385 million
retail-entertainment center that will be the new home for the
Academy Awards ceremony in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Most heartening, though, for those who have survived the lean
years is the upswing in cold, hard cash being spent by visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our business has improved dramatically,'' declared Robin
Moore, general manager of the Hamburger Hamlet across the street
from the legendary Mann's Chinese Theatre. ``It's been a good year
for a lot of restaurants, with gains of 1 or 2 percent, but we're
up over 10 percent in 1998. And that was on top of an 8 percent
gain, so 1997 was no slouch either for us.''
</P>
<P>
   A recently released Economic Research Associates survey showed
that the Hamburger Hamlet isn't alone. During 1997 in the core
area, movie business rose 22 percent, restaurants saw a surge of 14
percent, hotel activity was up 6 percent and retail sales increased
5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business has improved dramatically across every economic
sector,'' said David Wilcox, senior vice president at ERA.
``Hollywood's future looks very bright.''
</P>
<P>
   True, plenty of grittiness remains along Hollywood and Sunset
boulevards, but observers now believe Hollywood may ultimately
renew itself much like Times Square in New York has been reborn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in Hollywood since 1953 and we've seen it go from
its glory to its most trying times,'' said Michael Malick, vice
president and partner at the Ramsey-Shilling brokerage firm. ``Now,
it's returning. People who are getting in now are going to reap the
benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood was in a steep decline back in 1986 when the Community
Redevelopment Agency proposed a 30-year revitalization plan costing
$922 million. But those plans were tied up in litigation for
several years and then stalled by lack of developer interest amid
the recession of the early '90s and the 1994 Northridge Earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Observers say credit is due Mayor Richard Riordan and
Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg for making Hollywood an economic
priority in recent years. But they point most emphatically to the
1996 formation of a business improvement district on Hollywood
between La Brea Avenue and McCadden Place. The owners committed to
assessing themselves $600,000 a year for five years for cleaning,
security and decorations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been many keys _ dealing with the drug problem,
getting the blame sport stopped, focusing on a common vision _ but
the formation of the BID meant a lot,'' Goldberg said. ``It was
people putting money where their mouth was and assessing themselves
real money.''
</P>
<P>
   The immediate effect has been more visitors. ``The district's
`clean and safe' program has had a marked impact,'' Wilcox said.
``The BID has been gaining a reputation as one of the nation's most
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood is known to most people as the amorphous part of
Southern California where movies are made and dreams dashed. But it
is an actual community as well; not an incorporated city but
instead a seven-mile-square area of Los Angeles bounded by
Mulholland Drive on the north, Melrose Avenue on the south,
Crescent Heights Boulevard on the west and Western Avenue on the
east.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the world focuses on the stretch of Hollywood between La
Brea and Vine Street, an area that draws the lion's share of the
more than 9 million people visiting Hollywood each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When tourists come here, you can tell that it's not quite what
they had envisioned,'' Moore said. ``But it's also somewhere they
want to spend more time because it's much cleaner with more
security. Tourists are coming back and telling their friends.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a long-term change under way, too, as major real estate
operators swoop in. ``The formation of the BID sent a message to
large developers,'' said Julie Kleinick, director of acquisitions
and leasing for Albert Sweet Development. ``It was a signal that
things were about to change for the better.''
</P>
<P>
   In just the latest example, real estate investment firm
Kennedy-Wilson announced Wednesday that the House of Blues has
agreed to relocate its corporate headquarters from West Hollywood
to an office tower on Sunset and Vine, and will be the anchor
tenant in the building and occupy 33,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy-Wilson executive Nick Kanieff noted that monthly lease
rates for the building are now $1.75 per square foot, up 30 percent
over the going rate a year ago. ``We bought the building in
September with a 70 percent occupancy and it should be close to
fully leased by April,'' he said. ``It's a testament to the
revitalization and renaissance in the Hollywood market.''
</P>
<P>
   Some commercial properties now sell for $100 per square foot,
more than double the rate in 1995. CUNA Mutual Life Insurance is
now asking lease rates of $2 per square foot for offices in the El
Capitan building, also more than double the rate four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Morrison, the district's executive director, said,
``Owners are beginning to get unsolicited offers on their
properties and that's surprising to me. That really makes it
possible for us to tell people with confidence that what we're
doing is working.''
</P>
<P>
   Notable recent manifestations of recovery come near the tourist
core area with the reopening of Graumann's Egyptian Theatre and the
renovation of the El Capitan Theatre building, which opened a
Disney Store last month. ``The Disney Store sets a whole new
standard for cleanliness and presentation in the area,'' Morrison
said. ``It's a strong signal as to how retail can look in this
area.''
</P>
<P>
   The six-story El Capitan building has received a $5 million
seismic upgrade to repair extensive damage from the 1994 Northridge
Earthquake. ``The building was a minidisaster,'' recalled Jeff
Rouze, CUNA's senior asset manager, ``and renovating it didn't make
a lot of sense at the time because it was amid 50 years of decline
in that part of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   But CUNA gambled the investment would pay off and decided it
would trumpet its efforts. ``We didn't want to suffer in silence,''
Rouze said. ``I think our project has provided an example where
people could say, They're doing it so we can, too. It's a critical
aspect of real estate development _ you need to be able to cite
examples.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's agreement between the city of Los Angeles and
shopping center developer TrizecHahn, which calls for the
$385million retail-entertainment project adjacent to the Chinese
Theatre, is also cited as a milestone. Groundbreaking took place
three months ago for the center that will include a 3,300-seat
theater for the Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``TrizecHahn is one of the world's largest property management
firms so when they commit to an area, it's got to be taken
seriously,'' Malick noted.
</P>
<P>
   Other projects that have helped boost property values: a planned
expansion of the Capitol Records building, and the Hollywood
Marketplace office-retail project and an expansion-renovation of
the Cinerama Dome, both on Sunset.
</P>
<P>
   In an example of the burgeoning interest in prime properties,
the CRA is negotiating with four developers over the southwest
corner of Hollywood and Highland. The result may be a ``hybrid''
approach that would involve all the developers in a cooperative
partnership that could lead to construction in the year 2000,
according to CRA spokesman Jeff Skorneck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of interest in this project is tremendous,''
Skorneck said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Ullman, president of Grant Parking, said property owners
are sitting pretty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of buyers and not many sellers,'' said Ullman,
whose company owns 1 million square feet in Hollywood. ``The area
has obviously made huge strides. For people who never gave up, it's
just so great to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Observers believe the area's momentum will pick up, particularly
as the subway reaches into Hollywood next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most everything that's planned is still on drawing boards, so
what you're seeing now is just the tip of the iceberg,'' Kleinick
said. ``There are a lot of new players and new owners venturing
in.''
</P>
<P>
   The optimism is spreading. The original Hollywood Boulevard BID
has been expanded eastward 12 blocks to Gower Street, with the
additional owners kicking in an additional $1.53million for three
years. Another BID has been formed on Santa Monica Boulevard
between Highland Avenue and Vine, dubbing itself the Hollywood
Media District to focus on that area's ability to provide
production and post-production services.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is talking about leaving Hollywood any more, so I'm
very optimistic,'' noted Councilwoman Goldberg, a self-described
``cheerleader for Hollywood.'' ``The key to revitalizing an area is
to not look for one big magic pill but to take a painful look at it
all and then make sure each step is in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Kleinick reported that developers are scrambling to convert
industrial space into office and entertainment production uses in
the areas south of Sunset with lease rates running up to $2 per
square foot. Her company is spending $2 million to change over
50,000 square feet of storage space into 30,000 square feet of
high-end offices with skylights and wood crossbeams, and 20,000
square feet of covered parking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the rents we'll get warrant the conversion,'' she
said. &QL;

   CLEARWATER, Fla. _ ``So, you want to know about my love life?''
said Sophie Silverman, 85 years old and twice a widow, climbing out
of the pool and settling into a lounge chair at her retirement
community, On Top Of The World. She pushed her oversized purple
sunglasses halfway down her nose. ``It stinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that she isn't trying. Mrs. Silverman is out there, as they
say in the singles world. Here is her latest personal ad in the
monthly Senior Voice: ``JWWF (Jewish white widowed female), honest,
attractive, ISO (in search of) happy, healthy and physically fit
soul mate, 65-75 to give me back my life. I like going out dancing,
dining, travel, and would like a pleasant, romantic man for LTR
(long-term relationship).'' Mrs. Silverman is an optimist as well
as a romantic.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of men respond to her ads. They call, she puts on her
best smile and meets them for coffee at the Burger King on U.S. 19
and Sunset Point Road, a prime first-date spot, and she never hears
from them again. It seems that they, too, want someone younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want me, I'm old and gray,'' said Mrs. Silverman,
who happens to be a bottle blonde who works out at the gym and
looks a trim 75.
</P>
<P>
   Where do bald men with arthritic knees get off acting like this?
It's a universal lament among single women that all the good men
are taken. At On Top of the World, the women add, ``Or dead.''
After age 75, according to the census, there are four single women
for every single man.
</P>
<P>
   The dating game never stops. Indeed, for couples who move to
retirement communities, it resumes after decades on the sidelines
after one spouse dies _ just when the survivor is looking his or
her age. The need for companionship, tenderness, love and, yes,
sex, remains as important as ever, but the rules of the game have
changed. Not only women, but men, too, are racing the clock.
</P>
<P>
   At On Top Of The World and other Florida retirement communities
in Clearwater, St. Petersburg and Tampa, it is clear that as always
in matters of love and sex, there is a tremendous range in opinions
and desire. But men generally want younger women more than ever,
and can get them because of the sharp disparity in their numbers.
Plenty of women, like Mrs. Silverman, want younger men, but only
rarely do they succeed.
</P>
<P>
   At Bringing People Together, a Florida dating service that
specializes in senior citizens, a woman who answered the phone said
that while they helped men into their 90s, they tried not to take
women over 78.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while men who got the cold shoulder from the girls back in
high school may fare better in their 70s and 80s, that lasts only
until they lose their driver's license _ no one takes the bus on
dates down here _ or lose their health. No one is eager to be stuck
with someone who has to be nursed six months down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is vulnerable. How does someone go on a date after
being married to the same man or woman for half a century? Kathy
Beck, who founded Senior Connection, a South Florida newspaper that
publishes personal ads, says her office is barraged with questions
by nervous clients: What should they say? How should they act? When
do they sleep together?
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bruwelheide, 79, made his way to the Senior Connection
office in Brandon, near Tampa, five years ago, shortly after the
death of his wife of 52 years, Betty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very awkward,'' recalled Bruwelheide, a retired plumber.
``I broke down and cried right in front of them. I felt like I was
cheating on my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruwelheide placed an ad modestly describing himself as a
widowed male, in his mid-70s, in search of a companion who likes
bingo and short trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got 57 answers,'' he said. ``There's a lot more widows than
widowers. I think it's a shame. The men died too young, the women
sit there sorry, hurting, nobody to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   One letter he answered was from May McCulloch, a widow four
years his junior. A year and a half ago, Mrs. McCulloch moved in
with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call her Dear,'' Bruwelheide said. ``I have somebody to talk
to, somebody to say, `What are we going to have for supper?' I cook
half the time, she cooks half the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it love?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little slow on that,'' he said. ``When I say `love,' I'm
thinking of Betty.''
</P>
<P>
   Every Wednesday afternoon in St. Petersburg, hundreds of men and
women, many in their 70s and 80s, gather at the tea dance at the
Coliseum, which bills itself as the finest climate-controlled
ballroom in the South. As couples fox-trotted to the music of an
orchestra. Charlene Speaker, in a long flowered skirt, lacy blouse
and pearl earrings, waited to be asked to dance. Her husband died
five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want a marriage, just a companion,'' said Mrs.
Speaker, who allows only that she is past 65. ``Someone who's
loyal.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't seem like a lot to ask, especially for Mrs. Speaker,
a vivacious, striking brunette who can whirl gracefully around the
dance floor for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Speaker has been dating someone, but she is well aware that
she does not have her pick of men the way she did in her youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The men want younger women,'' she said, ``but what are they
going to do with them?''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, short, solicitous, smooth-stepping Neil Oliviero has
come into his own at 82. Oliviero, the former owner of a dress
factory, is one of the most popular men on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trouble is, I won't commit,'' Oliviero, who is divorced,
said with genuine sadness.
</P>
<P>
   He is still trying to work through his last serious
relationship, with a woman named Dorothy, who died nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I love Dorothy?'' he mused aloud. ``What is love?''
</P>
<P>
   The Coliseum is a long way from Evander Childs High School and
the Bronx, where Oliviero failed miserably with the opposite sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``To date a little runt like me, they'd be embarrassed,'' he
said, taking a break after the tango. ``My social success is a
vengeance against everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The Singles Club at On Top Of The World is a poor place to meet
men: Its 200 members are overwhelmingly women. But some women, of
course, do beat the odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I moved to Top of the World six years ago, I said to my
friend Irene, `What about men?''' said Sally Pearl, 63, a retired
junior high school teacher from Long Island who is divorced. ``She
said, `Don't even think about it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yet both Mrs. Pearl and her friend, Irene Hartwell, 83, found
companions.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Pearl was talking about men and dating over fruit and
chicken salads at a restaurant the other afternoon with Joyce Wohl,
a past president of the On Top Of The World singles club, and three
other women.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wohl, a retired social worker who declined to give her age,
said she had been on one date since her husband died nearly seven
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yech, it was a bummer,'' she said. ``The movie was
interesting. He was a drip.''
</P>
<P>
   Florence, a widow who revealed her age (77) but asked to be
identified by only her first name (she thought her family might
deem it inappropriate for her to be discussing such matters),
recalled the humiliation of her dinner with an 83-year-old man who
told her ``all about how he wanted to date this younger woman.''
</P>
<P>
   What would be her idea of the perfect man at this point in her
life?
</P>
<P>
   Florence said she had taken care of her husband for 14 years
before he died. She had loved him, but it is not something she
wants to go through again. She smiled slyly, then said, ``I would
like a note from his doctor stating that he's healthy _ or if he
isn't, that he only has six months to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Her companions whooped with laughter. They could have been any
group of women anywhere, indulging in a favorite pastime: trashing
men. They giggled over the single men at On Top Of The World: ``All
they want is a nurse with a purse.'' But behind the brave and
brittle wisecracks, they were serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to fall in love again,'' Nancy Nazar volunteered.
</P>
<P>
   Florence nodded, and said. ``So would I.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not that they necessarily want to remarry. Indeed, after
years of taking care of husbands and children, the widows of On Top
Of The World and other retirement communities make it clear that
they relish their independence.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them mention marriage and cooking in the same breath,
and say they would not want to cook for a man again. They have
plenty to do without cooking, they say. They stay in shape with
brisk walks in the morning, they go out to lunch, they take trips,
they join clubs, they volunteer, they keep up with their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent my whole life taking care of people,'' said Joanne
Golder, 62, who moved to On Top Of The World with her husband,
Mort, and was widowed nearly two years ago. ``This is my time to do
what I want for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Tucker, a 76-year-old widower, has been dating a widow
four years younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even my mother and my daughter say she's too old for me,''
Tucker said over breakfast at the Family Restaurant on Sunset Point
Road, around the corner from On Top Of The World.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like a woman 55 to 68,'' said Tucker, a retired
mechanical engineer who excels at ballroom dancing. ``It will make
me feel good. I feel they'll be more lively.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he realize that in this market he is a hot commodity? ``Oh,
absolutely,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he has his own insecurities. He, too, feels compelled to lie
about his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can get away with 65 to 68,'' he said. If he owned up to 76,
he said, ``I feel I'd be rejected.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Beller was at the pool at On Top of the World, talking
about his continuing argument with his friend Sophie Silverman _
and they are just friends, both say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't make her understand the difference between love and
companionship,'' Beller said. ``In my opinion, companionship is
more important than love.''
</P>
<P>
   Beller is 80; his wife of 46 years, Florence, died 15 months
ago. She had Alzheimer's disease, and for six years he took care of
her. Now, he wears her wedding ring on his pinky finger, and tells
strangers how much he loved her.
</P>
<P>
   But meanwhile Beller, who still works as a consultant in
industrial physics and has a condo full of books by Vladimir
Nabokov and Thomas Mann, says he enjoys the company of women,
taking them to dinner and classical music concerts and yes, to bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister, who's 72, says to me, `Get some condoms,''' he
said. ``I said, `OK,' but I haven't yet.''
</P>
<P>
   What about AIDS? ``I'm 80 years old. What's going to happen to
me? Am I going to die at 140?''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Silverman said later: ``Jack gets all the women. He can
drive at night.''

(ATTN: CONN. ) FACING CHILD PORNOGRAPHY TRIAL, PROFESSOR IS CHARGED
IN SEX ABUSE 
(DW )
</HEADLINE>
  By   MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ A Yale University professor awaiting trial on
a federal charge of possessing child pornography was charged Monday
with sexually assaulting a 13-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   The professor, Antonio Lasaga, was charged with two counts of
first-degree sexual assault, risking injury to a minor and
``promoting a minor in an obscene performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Police, who would not provide details of the charges, arrested
Lasaga at his home in Cheshire, where he was confined after
officials determined he had violated the conditions of his release
on the federal charges. Bond was set at $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lasaga had held the position of master, a social adviser and
mentor at Saybrook College, one of the residential colleges where
Yale undergraduates sleep and eat.
</P>
<P>
   He resigned from his duties there in November after FBI agents
seized two computers from his office.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, he was charged with the receipt and possession
of child pornography. A statement by the U.S. Attorney's office in
New Haven asserted that Lasaga had ``downloaded from the Internet,
and kept numerous images of, child pornography.''
</P>
<P>
   He was released on the condition that he have no contact with
minor children until his case was resolved.
</P>
<P>
   But on Dec. 9, he was placed on home confinement with electronic
monitoring after federal prosecutors asserted that he had been seen
driving back and forth in front of the home of a child and ``was
observed parked at the minor child's bus stop shortly before the
bus was due to arrive.''
</P>
<P>
   A Yale official said Lasaga remains on paid leave from his
position as a professor of geochemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas P. Conroy, Yale's acting director of public affairs,
called the new charges ``very serious and deeply troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The university will continue to follow the developments very
closely,'' he said in a statement. ``As more facts become
available, the university will make a decision about what to do
next.''

GOVERNOR TO TRAVEL NATION WITH ALTERNATIVE TO FAILED GOP TACTICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Declaring that Republicans in Washington had undermined the
party with a series of ``horrible blunders'' this year, Gov. George
E. Pataki of New York said Tuesday that elected officials from
beyond the nation's capital were more in tune with Republican
ideology and better suited to help the party regain the White House
in 2000. Pataki announced that he would travel the nation to offer
alternatives to the ``failed strategies'' his party had embraced.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's criticisms of his party, voiced in a series of
conversations over the last two weeks, were directed both at
congressional leaders, for the way they handled the national
elections, and, to a lesser extent, at his own political
consultants for the way they ran Sen. Alfonse D'Amato's
unsuccessful re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pataki assailed Republicans for neglecting their
cornerstone issues to focus on the Lewinsky affair, he declined
Tuesday to criticize the House vote to impeach President Clinton.
But he strongly urged the Senate to ``come up with a bipartisan
solution'' that, he said, would not involve removing Clinton from
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans have governed highly successfully across the
country, in traditionally Republican states and traditionally
Democratic states, with a philosophy that works, that unites the
Republican Party, and that unites the Republican Party with a
majority of the American people,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only in Washington _ largely in Washington _ where the
national party has lost that agenda, has gone off on tangents, has
had a very difficult time transitioning from opposition to
governing,'' Pataki added.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's remarks came as his advisers say he is
considering a run for national office, and at a time when some
Republicans suggest that Pataki's own solid re-election effort
could be tarnished by the otherwise poor showing of the New York
party last month, with losses by both D'Amato and incumbent
Attorney General Dennis Vacco.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's decision to travel the nation left little doubt that he
wanted Republicans nationally to consider his ideas _ and, perhaps,
Pataki himself _ in assembling their ticket and platform for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Pataki was vague about his exact political
intentions. He would not rule out running for national office in
2000. But he also said he was now considering seeking a third term
as governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   In the interviews, Pataki asserted that Republicans in
Washington had neglected touchstone conservative issues _ reducing
taxes, slashing government regulation, cutting the welfare rolls
and promoting ``a strong national defense'' _ in the rush to focus
on Clinton's personal life and on issues like opposition to
abortion rights and gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   It fell to Republican governors like himself, Pataki said, to
steer the party back to the successful course it followed under
Ronald Reagan, which he said accounted for the party's dominance in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki offered a novel retort to the suggestion that Republicans
like himself, who favor abortion rights and some gay rights, could
never survive the generally conservative Republican nominating
process: He maintained that he held the ``truly conservative''
viewpoint on both those issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a conservative,'' Pataki said. ``But I believe in limited
government. I happen to think that limited government includes
keeping government out of the private lives of people. I consider
that to be a natural extension of the belief in individual
privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's advisers arrived at an interview two weeks ago with
research to demonstrate that Pataki's victory margin _ more than 20
percentage points over his nearest rival, in a relatively crowded
and well-financed field _ was the largest of any Republican
gubernatorial candidate in the state's history.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said he had no regrets about the way he ran his campaign.
However, he was critical of the way his own political consultants,
Arthur Finkelstein and Kieran Mahoney, managed D'Amato's contest
for a fourth term.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we did not do is give the voters a reason to
vote for Senator D'Amato, as opposed to voting against Chuck
Schumer,'' Pataki said, referring to the Democratic congressman
from Brooklyn who defeated D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Finkelstein did not return calls seeking comment, and Mahoney
declined to comment on Pataki's remarks.

EDITORIAL: PRIVACY RIGHTS IN THE CAR AND THE HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Time said in an editorial for Wednesday, Dec. 23:
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's unanimous ruling this month denying the
police blanket authority to search a car after ticketing the driver
for a minor traffic violation, such as speeding, was an important
victory for privacy rights. At issue was an Iowa law that extended
the power police now have to conduct a warrantless search when a
driver is arrested. The new law allowed such searches even in
routine traffic stops where there was no arrest and no suspicion of
any criminal activity. Had the court gone the other way, such
intrusions _ unnecessary to insuring officer safety or preserving
evidence _ would have become widespread.
</P>
<P>
   The laudable ruling was a rare departure for a court that had
just watered down privacy rights in the home by validating the
peeping-Tom behavior of a Minnesota police officer. The officer saw
two men bagging cocaine in a third person's basement apartment by
peering through a gap in closed venetian blinds before obtaining a
search warrant.
</P>
<P>
   A state court tossed out the narcotics convictions of the two
men, concluding that the officer's warrantless snooping amounted to
an illegal search of guests in a home. But a majority of the
Supreme Court said the two men had ``no legitimate expectation of
privacy'' in a home belonging to someone else that for them was
``simply a place to do business.'' Yet as Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted
in a spirited dissent, the refusal to honor the privacy rights of
guests inevitably undermines the established privacy rights of the
host, by giving police new incentive to pry illegally.

AS ACTION ENDS IN IRAQ, U.S. TRIMS GULF FORCES
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCE SULTAN AIR BASE, Saudi Arabia _ Having carried out its
attack on Iraq, the United States has begun to reduce its forces in
the Persian Gulf, withdrawing more than three dozen fighters,
bombers and other aircraft ordered to the region over the last
month, Pentagon officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon also plans to order the aircraft carrier
Enterprise, whose Navy and Marine fighter jets provided much of the
punch in last week's attack on Iraq, to leave the gulf, along with
its armada of cruisers, destroyers, attack submarines and support
ships by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Once the withdrawals are completed, the American force in the
region will return to roughly the size it was before this latest
confrontation with President Saddam Hussein over United Nations
weapon inspections, military officials said. With nearly 200
aircraft and a dozen warships led by the carrier Carl Vinson, the
United States will still have enough fire power in the region, they
said, to carry out additional strikes as the administration has
vowed to do if Iraq does anything provocative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're satisfied our day-to-day force _ what we call our
near-continuous force _ is adequate,'' Marine Corps Gen. Anthony C.
Zinni, the commander of all American forces in the region, said in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced the reductions on Tuesday as Zinni and
Defense Secretary William Cohen left Washington for a pre-Christmas
tour of American troops in the gulf, arriving here early Wednesday
morning at this remote desert base southeast of the Saudi capital,
Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
   Zinni, Cohen and other administration officials have portrayed
the four days of strikes _ by far the most punishing attack on Iraq
since the Gulf War _ as an unalloyed success, but questions remain
about the attacks' long-term impact.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on the way to Saudi Arabia, for example, Zinni
said that Hussein's government would quickly be able to rebuild the
communications system needed to keep a firm grip on the country. He
also said for the first time that Iraq's seemingly feeble
anti-aircraft fire had forced pilots to abort strikes on some
sites, though he described those targets as secondary ones.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, for his part, said the raids appeared to have done little
to force Hussein to comply once again with the weapons inspection.
On the contrary, he said, those seem certain to end for good now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not seen any evidence of behavior modification on the
part of Saddam Hussein,'' Cohen said. ``I think he is going to
continue to try to frustrate the inspections and try to get relief
from the sanctions. I think that has been his goal all along. And
he will do whatever he can to portray himself as a victim, hoping
the world has suffered some case of accommodating amnesia.''
</P>
<P>
   At the peak of the strikes over the weekend, the United States
had 301 aircraft in the gulf, half of them aboard the Enterprise
and the Carl Vinson.
</P>
<P>
   The combat jets being withdrawn include 12 of the 15 B-52's that
battered Iraq with 90 air-launched cruise missiles from the British
base on Diego Garcia, an island in the Indian Ocean. Six B-1's that
had been based in Oman _ and took part in the bombers' first combat
missions after three decades of troubled development _ are
returning to the United States, as are 10 A-10 attack jets and 10
KC-10 aerial tankers.

THE REAL GIFT OF CHRISTMAS IS BORN AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   RADFORD, Va. - As I write this, I am sitting in the house in
which I grew up, the house where I spent the first 22 Christmases
of my life.
</P>
<P>
   And I am thinking about gifts.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't in a while, at least not in this fashion. As you grow
older, the old saw about it being better to give than receive rings
more and more true. As an adult, you're more concerned about
whether your wife will actually wear that pair of electric-blue
shoes you got her than you are with what's in the packages under
the tree with your name on them.
</P>
<P>
   But just lately I have been doing a mental rewind, trying to
remember the best gifts that I saw waiting as I trotted down the
stairs as a child, the tree in the sun porch visible from the
landing, my Christmas radar cranked up into overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   The electric-football game was a big hit, as I recall. The
electric-train set was also a winner, as were the fire engine and
the G.I. Joe and the toy saxophone. Sure wish we'd hung on to the
Rock 'Em-Sock 'Em Robots; they're supposedly worth a fortune today.
</P>
<P>
   Countless other gifts came and went _ played with, broken and
discarded before they made much of an impression. I doubt I'll ever
be able to dredge them up from my memory.
</P>
<P>
   I grew up the youngest of five children, the baby brother. For
much of my life I saw Christmas from that perspective. I was the
first to volunteer to get out the box of tree decorations from the
closet, the last to tire of hanging stockings on the mantel, the
only remaining holdout when it came time to drop whatever you were
doing and sit down to watch ``A Charlie Brown Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even I started to wear down a bit as I grew older. There was
magic in those gifts I unwrapped as a kid. Later in life, they grew
more serviceable, more practical. Yes, I'm always happy to receive
underwear, but it doesn't make me giddy the way a Monkees talking
hand puppet did. Can't be helped. Everyone grows up sometime, which
is not necessarily a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Things began to change a little when my siblings started having
children. On trips home for the holidays, I loved reading ``A Visit
From St. Nicholas'' to my nieces before they went to bed Christmas
Eve; I loved lending Santa a hand with toys that needed to be
assembled after they drifted off. Still, nice as it was, something
was missing.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, my perspective has taken a nice little jaunt in
the Way-Back Machine. That's because this is the first Christmas
I'll spend with my own child. She is too young to remember anything
that goes on here, of course, but that hasn't made the holiday any
less festive for me. Despite her tiny status, we have put her
through many of the holiday paces, and it's been wonderful. Seeing
the holiday through her eyes has made me a kid again.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Charlie Brown Christmas'' suddenly packed all its old power
_ Linus' holiday-saving soliloquy once again brought a tear to my
eye. I'm paying more attention to TV toy commercials. The mere
jingle of a sleigh bell is enough to make me break into an off-key
``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran parents tell me it only gets better. Hard to imagine,
but I'll happily take them at their word. I'm enjoying this
newfound innocence and wonder too much to doubt them.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and about those gifts. I know they aren't what Christmas is
really about (ask Linus). Still, gifts have been on my mind lately.
</P>
<P>
   That's because this Christmas Eve, I'll read about the night
before Christmas to my own daughter for the first time. With luck,
she'll nod off shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   A little while later, I'll gather up the greatest gift I've ever
gotten _ the greatest gift I'll ever get _ and place her in her
crib for the night.
</P>
<P>
   I hope she sleeps through till Christmas. &QL;

CHRISTMAS TREE THAT COUNTS IS THE FAMILY ONE  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR FRIDAY, DEC. 24) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURI NOTARO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Are you sure this is the one you want?'' my husband
said, holding the trunk of a pine tree in a fenced-in portion of
the ABCO parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Honestly, I wasn't. The tree looked quite lopsided, was bare on
one side and had the branches crushed in on the other. But I'm not
a fool; I knew what I was up against. I had learned from Christmas
past that if I didn't pick out a tree in 45 seconds flat, my
husband would start getting nervous and aggravated, and would
interrupt my tree-picking to announce that we had to go home right
away because he needed to use the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   I looked at him, his hands covered in sap, his right leg
beginning to twitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God, I love this tree!'' I shouted. ``We could look for a
whole three minutes and not find a tree as good as this one! I've
never seen such a beautiful tree!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pay the man,'' my husband said, dragging it toward the car. I
could tell he was already starting to get worked up, and that was
not a good sign. We still had to get the tree home and put it up.
</P>
<P>
   Sprawled like a corpse on our front porch, the tree patiently
waited as my husband approached it with a buzzing circular saw to
cut off several inches from the trunk. This was also not a good
sign. I was pretty sure that I broke the saw over the summer when I
tried to sharpen some knives with it.
</P>
<P>
   Before I could say anything, my husband moved in and sunk the
blade into the tree. The tree twitched and bobbed as the saw began
to scream, the blade stuck. He held on tight, his teeth clenched.
The tree shook violently until my husband stepped on it and tried
to pull the saw out. Everything after that happened very quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing I saw was my husband covering one eye and
screaming as the saw, now emitting strands of smoke, was tiredly
spinning to a halt at his feet with a slow, grinding wheeze.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it!'' I heard him yell as he marched into the house to
flush out the chunk of wood that had smacked him in the eye. ``I
hate Christmas! I hate Christmas! I hate Christmas!''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't say anything. It's always best for me, in these
situations, to cower on the floor, roll over on my back and offer
myself for sacrifice, whimpering slightly. But personally, as I
rested my head against the dusty floorboards and found my best bra
(only one underwire missing) beneath the couch, I thought to
myself, ``How can you hate Christmas?''
</P>
<P>
   I understand that the holidays sometimes bring out the worst in
people; I've seen news footage of shoppers attacking salespeople
and even turning on one another over that talking hairball toy that
I thought was called the ``Puff Daddy'' until I watched the
Billboard Awards a couple of weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But I've grown to enjoy our family holidays and even look
forward to them, despite the fact that they now include medical
procedures, as was demonstrated at Thanksgiving when my mother
hauled a high-blood-pressure machine to the dining room table and
made all of us roll up our sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you want me to bring for Christmas?'' I asked her
then, as she tightened the cuff hard enough around my arm that I
lost feeling in my hand. ``Mashed potatoes, yams, or just a urine
sample?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, I look forward to sitting around the dining room table
with my family, talking about past holidays when we were kids. We
talk about how we remember Christmas as cold and exciting, as my
grandfather, Pop Pop, walked my sisters and me around the block on
Christmas Eve so Santa could deliver our presents early, because,
Pop Pop said, ``My girls are special.''
</P>
<P>
   We held his hand as we pointed to an airplane in the sky, and he
would agree that it was Rudolph, coming to make the special stop at
our house. After a traumatic fourth-grade episode when someone
spilled the beans about Santa Claus, I still went on our walk with
Pop Pop, and didn't say a word when he spotted a 747 and said that
it was almost time to go back to the house.
</P>
<P>
   The best part of Christmas was taking our walk, watching our
breath turn cold on a chilly desert night, smelling Pop's tobacco
as smoke drifted back from his pipe and hearing him say, as he
nudged me with a wink, ``I saw your mother filling up your stocking
with underwear again. My daughter never listens to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, I will really miss that. This Christmas will be our
third without Pop Pop, and also our third (begin ital) with (end
ital) his namesake, and my nephew, Nicholas. Although he fought
hard to live long enough to see his great-grandchild, Pop Pop died
two days before Nicholas was born.
</P>
<P>
   As a family, we've tried to focus on what we've gained rather
than what we've lost, evident by the mountains of wrapped toys
under the tree with Nicholas' name on them. Without saying
anything, we'll all know it should have been Pop Pop who handed
Nicholas his presents, helped him tear apart a stubbornly wrapped
package, the one who should have taken him on Christmas Eve walks;
and that deep holes really can't be filled with any amount of
gifts.
</P>
<P>
   After our traditional dinner of antipasto, we'll bundle Nicholas
in his coat and little gloves, and before we head out the door for
his first walk, I'll have to say, ``Wait. Take everything off.
Grandma says we all have to wee-wee first so her test will be ready
when we get back.''
</P>
<P>
   Then we'll head out again, taking the first in what I hope will
be a new tradition in our family, except for the submission of body
fluids. I'm hoping that I'll get to hold one of Nicholas' pudgy
little hands, and that an airplane will pass so my sisters and I
can point to the sky and tell him that Rudolph comes early for
special little boys.
</P>
<P>
   I'm going to keep a pipe in my pocket, just in case. &QL;

PAUL SMUCKER, 81, EX-CHAIRMAN AND CATALYST AT JELLY COMPANY
</HEADLINE>

 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul H. Smucker, the former chairman of the jelly company in
Orrville, Ohio, that bears his family's name, died last Thursday at
his home in Orrville. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Smucker is credited with helping transform the J.M. Smucker Co.
from a small, regional jam and jelly manufacturer to a company with
global operations and a product line that includes preserves, jams,
jellies and other fruit-spread products; health and natural foods;
beverages; ice cream toppings, and natural peanut butter.
</P>
<P>
   Smucker had worked for Smucker's, founded by his grandfather 101
years ago, since 1939, with a brief hiatus from the company when he
served aboard a Navy destroyer in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   After serving in the war, Smucker became Smucker's general
manager, a position he held until he became the company's president
in 1961. In 1970, he assumed the additional titles of chairman and
chief executive. Smucker turned over the company's presidency to
his eldest son, Tim, in 1981. Tim Smucker succeeded his father as
chairman in 1987, the same year Smucker's younger son, Richard,
became the company's president. At that time, Smucker became
chairman of Smucker's executive committee, a position he held until
his death.
</P>
<P>
   Smucker graduated from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, from
which he also received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. He was a
former board member of the Kellogg Company and the First National
Bank of Orrville and was a trustee of the W.K. Kellogg Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Smucker is survived by his wife of 58 years, the former Lorraine
Smith; a sister, Marcella Smucker Clark of Scottsdale, Ariz.; a
daughter, Susan Smucker Wagstaff of Carmel, Calif.; his two sons,
Tim, of Orrville, and Richard, of Medina, Ohio; eight
grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.

HOW ONE PLAY ALTERED THE SEASON FOR GIANTS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the New York Giants had one more victory today, they would be
headed to Philadelphia this weekend needing only a victory for a
playoff berth, and they would not need help from another team to
earn it.
</P>
<P>
   In late December, when you've won four of your last five games,
one victory somewhere back in September or October seems so simple
for these Giants, so perfectly reasonable. And the fact is, it
could have been that simple.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' uneven season, which could still be a playoff
season, lost its way as a winning season _ which it cannot be _ in
the second week, at the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes all the words written and spoken about a team during
the preseason actually turn out to be accurate, and the one thing
said repeatedly about the 1998 Giants was that they needed to
stockpile victories early in the season because their late-season
schedule was so onerous.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the Giants defeated Denver and Kansas City at
home this month, which few would have predicted. But those
victories only nullified the effects of losses that weren't
expected: at Washington and at home to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   No, the day the Giants season turned sour was Sept. 13 at
Oakland. It has taken three months for the team to recover. You
could even say the season went sour on the first play from
scrimmage at Oakland when Raiders running back Napoleon Kaufman
sliced 80 yards through a sleeping Giants defense for a
demoralizing touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants lost the game, 20-17, and if the Giants don't make
the playoffs, that's the game and that's the play that kept them
out.
</P>
<P>
   Sure the Raiders turned out to be better than most expected, but
on the second weekend of the season, the Giants didn't believe
that, neither did the Raiders, and most of all, neither did their
less than enthusiastic following in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   That day in Oakland should have been a huge mismatch. The
Giants, a defending division champion, were 1-0 after a rousing
opening-day victory over the Redskins, whom people feared at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders had won four games the year before, and in their
season opener the week before, they were embarrassed on national
television by Kansas City. The Raiders were a troubled lot.
</P>
<P>
   It's true the Giants had to travel to the West Coast to play the
Raiders, but there was no home-field advantage on game day for the
Raiders. Only 40,050 fans showed up and most of them seemed
disinterested, numbed by three successive nonwinning Raiders
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   A mature team bent on making a return to the playoffs takes the
Raiders out of that game early, preying on the Raiders' self-doubts
and sending the few home fans back to their tailgate parties in the
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants did the opposite. Three Giants missed the chance to
tackle Kaufman on the first play.
</P>
<P>
   Tackling is effort and concentration. The Giants lacked both on
that vital first play.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders suddenly believed, the crowd got into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Giants rallied in the game and an official's call
probably cost the Giants three points, but the moment to take over
that game was lost early. The distracted Giants committed 15
penalties, and on the Raiders' game-winning drive in the fourth
quarter, the Giants defense _ one of the league's best in 1997 _
gave up a first down on a third-and-26.
</P>
<P>
   In the whim and whimsy of a road game in the National Football
League, the Giants fell three points short. They were 1-1 instead
of 2-0. The Giants' slide got much worse from there, but that
wasn't entirely unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, as predicted, have played one of the toughest
schedules in the league this year. The cumulative record of their
1998 opponents is 99-81. But the game against the Raiders, who have
played an easy schedule this year and still won only eight games,
could easily have been won. The Giants had every mental edge that
day but lacked the maturity to use it.
</P>
<P>
   It's always easy to look back and pick out one game that could
have turned a season, and other people might point to last month's
defeat at Washington as equally crucial. But there was something
about the Giants' play in Oakland that day that said something
about where they were headed.
</P>
<P>
   And one can't help but recall a statement from Giants defensive
end Michael Strahan in the minutes following the Raiders game.
Strahan is the team's most dependable player and its most
perceptive spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problem is that we're not as good as we think we are,''
Strahan said. ``We better wake up to that fact before it's too
late. Today's game is a great example of looking at the schedule
and thinking about the games you think you should win.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of wishful thinking that can come back to
haunt you.'' &QL;

   The New York Times said in an editorial Wednesday, Dec. 23:
</P>
<P>
   Few spectacles rival the Olympics for pomp and spectator
interest. For some sports with few fans, the Olympics provide
virtually the only major international exposure. Televised around
the world, both the winter and summer Olympic Games can enhance the
reputation of host cities.
</P>
<P>
   The organization behind the spectacles is the International
Olympic Committee, a self-perpetuating group of 114 men and women
that in turn is dominated by an executive committee of 11 people.
In practice the executive committee chooses new members of the IOC
and runs the organization. The principal duty of the full
membership is to pick host cities.
</P>
<P>
   Now a member of the executive committee, Marc Hodler of
Switzerland, has charged that there is widespread corruption in the
choice of host cities. He said agents, one a member of the IOC, had
promised to deliver blocs of IOC votes in return for favors from
the aspiring cities. Most of the allegations are unproved, but
organizers of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City admit they
set up a $400,000 scholarship fund that benefited relatives of some
IOC members, although they say it was a humanitarian gesture rather
than bribery.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Antonio Samaranch, the president of the IOC since 1980, has
proposed further concentrating power in the executive committee
that he heads, by letting it instead of the full IOC membership
pick the cities. Given that the executive committee and Samaranch
were running the IOC when the alleged corruption was taking place,
that is hardly a credible solution.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC could best clean up its act with some strong
conflict-of-interest rules, setting forth exactly what is
permissible. Samaranch said members would no longer be allowed to
visit cities that were bidding. But it is hard to see how decisions
could be made without some inspection. Instead, the IOC should
restrict such visits and pay all expenses out of its own funds. Any
city found to have violated the rules should be banned from holding
the Olympics, and any IOC member found to have solicited such a
violation would be expelled.

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Roger Clemens threw one final curve Tuesday in the bizarre saga
that has followed his Dec. 2 demand to be traded from the Toronto
Blue Jays. He has decided not to go anywhere after all.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clemens, the only five-time Cy Young Award winner in baseball
history, withdrew his trade demand Tuesday and said unless a trade
agreement satisfactory to Toronto can be completed, he is prepared
to play for the Blue Jays next season.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he took a stand of a different kind.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens expressed anger and regret at what he called a personal
attack against him, his family and agents Alan and Randy Hendricks
by members of the Astros' front office. He reiterated his desire to
play closer to his home but said he does not want to play for
Astros president Tal Smith or general manager Gerry Hunsicker. It
was Hunsicker who announced at baseball's winter meetings this
month the club no longer was interested in obtaining Clemens
because of his financial demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very upset at what Mr. Smith and Mr. Hunsicker said and
how they directed things towards me as a person,'' Clemens said at
his agents' office in Spring. ``I don't know them personally; they
don't know me as a person. I am not interested in working with, or
alongside, those two individuals. None whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know at one point we were very, very close at getting
something done. I told Randy and Alan both to go for it and get
something done whatever they could do. I am disappointed. We will
move on.''
</P>
<P>
   After concluding the Blue Jays lacked interest in building a
competitive club, Clemens demanded a trade from Toronto to a
contender or a team closer to his home, citing a promise made by
former Blue Jays president Paul Beeston prior to his signing in
December 1996. Clemens confirmed for the first time Tuesday that he
has written agreements with Toronto that allow him to demand or
veto any trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``In short, Roger has control over where he plays and under what
terms,'' Randy Hendricks said in a prepared statement. ``Thus,
Roger's agreement with Toronto effectively grants him rights
roughly equivalent to those held by a free agent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, along with the Texas Rangers, New York Yankees and
Cleveland Indians, were considered the front-runners to acquire the
36-year-old righthander. But as Toronto general manager Gord Ash's
bold timetable of seven to 10 days for trading Clemens passed,
attention began to center on the pitcher's contract demands.
</P>
<P>
   Hendricks said he never asked for any club to renegotiate
Clemens' existing contract as a condition for a trade. Two days
after Clemens was made available, Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr.
began discussions with Clemens' agents, at which time he informed
them of the club's desire to limit any contract to a total of three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, Hendricks sent McLane a proposal that asked the
Astros to extend Clemens' contract for one year through 2001 at
$27.4 million, which would amount to a new $43.5 million,
three-year deal and give Clemens the second-highest average salary
in baseball ($14.5 million). Clemens is owed $16.1 million over the
final two years of his contract. Toronto also was believed to be
asking for a three- to four-player package of front-line players.
</P>
<P>
   Following discussions with McLane, Hendricks said he left for
the winter meetings in Nashville, Tenn., with the understanding the
Astros would submit a counteroffer within one or two days and a
deal for Clemens was close. Upon his arrival in Nashville the next
day, Hendricks learned of Hunsicker's news conference ending talks
_ an announcement McLane later said was done without his knowledge.
McLane, who emerged as the chief negotiator in the talks, called to
apologize.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an unfortunate thing,'' McLane said. ``I think
forgiveness is what we ask for more than one thing. We all make
mistakes. Things occur that you wish were not said or done _ they
do, and you have to live in reality. We all respect Roger and his
accomplishments and the Hendricks for being one of the leaders in
sports and baseball management of players.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the news conference never been called, Hendricks said he is
confident his client would be wearing an Astros uniform today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety-nine percent sure, yes, that would be my judgment,''
Hendricks said. ``We cannot conceive with any constructive reason
whatsoever why that press conference was called. As one general
manager told me the next morning, `I never really believed I would
have a chance to get Roger Clemens, because I always thought he was
going to Houston.' This is unprecedented, to say the least, that a
club has an opportunity to open a new stadium with the most
important player in the history of their city with five Cy Youngs
and they call a press conference for no other reason but to devalue
his public image. Amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendricks said one team offered Clemens a four-year, $60 million
deal, and another suggested a two-year extension at more than the
$15 million per year Kevin Brown agreed to with the Los Angeles
Dodgers. By withdrawing his trade demand, Hendricks said Clemens
was essentially ``burning a $44 million lottery ticket'' by
remaining with the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   While Clemens prepares to return to the Blue Jays, Hendricks
said the comments _ and the damage _ made at the Astros' news
conference portraying Clemens as greedy are irreversible.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has followed in Houston and around America is an
outpouring of condemnation of Roger Clemens and myself as a result
of this press conference,'' Hendricks said. ``Look at the damage
it's done. We've become a target of everybody coast to coast. You
tell me how you repair that.''

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
After two-plus years of operation, the American Basketball League
on Tuesday closed its doors because of financial problems and filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``At this point, the league is out of money,'' said Gary
Cavalli, one of the league's four co-founders and its chief
executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, the ABL's board of directors decided to suspend the
rest of the 1998-99 schedule and file a voluntary Chapter 11
bankruptcy petition to resolve creditors' claims. That action also
will ensure an orderly liquidation of the league, which had
operated in the shadow of the Women's National Basketball
Association almost since its inception in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sad day for our fans, employees, players and
coaches, and for women's basketball in general,'' Cavalli said.
``We are proud of what we accomplished as a pioneer in women's
professional athletics. We put a great product on the floor. We
gave America's best women athletes an opportunity to play
professionally in this country during basketball season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave it our best shot, we fought the good fight, and we had
a good run. But we were unable to obtain the television exposure
and sponsorship support needed to make the league viable
long-term.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the ABL's collapse was unsettling for Comets owner
Leslie Alexander and Comets coach/general manager Van Chancellor.
At a news conference in the Rockets corporate offices Tuesday a few
hours after the ABL shut down, Alexander confirmed Chancellor had
been given a contract extension that will keep him in Houston
through 2002. Then, Alexander talked about the fall of the ABL.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, we liked, in a way, having two leagues because
it really promoted the sport of women's basketball,'' Alexander
said. ``I'm personally saddened by the loss of the league because
it's the holiday time; people are going to lose their jobs. I
really hate to see that happen to anybody in any city.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we really weren't competing. (The ABL) was playing in a
different season, different time. And it really wasn't a
competitive aspect at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The ABL played its 48-game schedule from September to March. The
WNBA plays from June to September.
</P>
<P>
   Said Chancellor: ``This was my reaction today: contract
extension for Van Chancellor, X number of players out of a job in
the ABL, and that's sad. It's sad for me, sad for them. I have been
in the game for 35 years, and I don't want to see any female
basketball player without a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander said there's no indication how the collapse of the ABL
will affect the WNBA, which begins its third season in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know any of those answers yet,`` he said.
</P>
<P>
   WNBA president Val Ackerman said it's too early to discuss
potential player movements. Like Alexander and Chancellor, she was
surprised by the sudden demise of the rival league.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unfortunate setback for the women's sports
movement,'' Ackerman said. ``We applaud the great efforts and
passion of the ABL's players and all the league and team personnel
who labored so hard to start and sustain the league.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the ABL was hatched in 1995. The league, made up of
eight charter teams, played its first game Oct. 18, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion Long Beach StingRays went out of business after
their inaugural season in 1997-98, leaving nine teams in operation
when the ABL folded. The teams were in Chicago; Columbus, Ohio;
Denver; Hartford, Conn. (New England Blizzard); Nashville, Tenn.;
Philadelphia; San Jose, Calif.; Seattle; and Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is obviously a shock,'' said Houston native Barbara
Bolden, a former player at LSU who had joined the Blizzard this
year. ``But you kind of sat there and wondered, `Well, is it going
to last?' The same thing people have always been saying. But there
were things that indicated (the collapse of the league was
imminent), like the attendance was down this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of felt that since the NBA wasn't there this year,
people would come watch us play. They really didn't. Then, you're
thinking, `With the NBA not there, maybe we can get on TV (more).'
And that didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ABL attendance increased 23 percent last season to 4,333 per
game, and the league's TV ads this fall offered it as an
alternative to fans dismayed by the NBA lockout. Still, it couldn't
come close to the attendance figures for the WNBA, which played to
an average crowd of 10,869 last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbus Quest was the two-time defending champion of the
ABL, but several administrative moves involving that franchise
served to indicate in November the league might be in trouble.
Brian Agler, the coach/general manager, was asked to relinquish his
duties as GM and take a 37-percent cut in pay. Agler eventually
accepted a job as coach/GM of the expansion Minnesota franchise in
the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   The ABL signed the lion's share of college seniors in its first
year of existence, but the WNBA moved to the forefront in that area
last year. Additionally, the sister organization of the NBA lured
1997 ABL Most Valuable Player Nikki McCray from the Quest before
the '98 season and welcomed Olympian Dawn Staley last summer.
Staley, who has yet to be assigned to a WNBA team, was the marquee
player for the Philadelphia Rage and one of the premier players in
the ABL.
</P>
<P>
   Staley and McCray, a member of the Washington Mystics, are
likely to have a lot of company from the old sorority on WNBA
courts this summer.

SOWARD FILLS OUT PAPERWORK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC junior wide receiver R. Jay Soward seems more
inclined than ever to leave for the NFL as he filled out a league
application this week that will gauge his stock for the upcoming
draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what it does sound like, but I don't know,'' Soward
said. ``There's a lot of things I still have to deal with. A lot of
people are saying (I'll be drafted) between 15th and 20th
(overall).
</P>
<P>
   ``If the opportunity is there _ guaranteed that I'll go in the
first round, make great money and have good circumstances _ how can
anybody pass that up?''
</P>
<P>
   One person expected to try to convince Soward to stay at USC for
his senior season is coach Paul Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't done much research on (Soward's chances) because
it's my opinion that with the kind of year he had, he certainly
would benefit from another year,'' Hackett said. ``I would say (he
is) a second-round draft choice from what little scuttlebutt I get.
I don't know how accurate that is. He's certainly a marvelous
talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward said he will not make a final decision until hearing from
NFL general managers after USC returns from the Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's unfinished business at USC next year, but also
financial business for me to consider for my family,'' Soward said.
</P>
<P>
   USC's other top junior, linebacker Chris Claiborne, is expected
to announce he is turning pro sometime after the Trojans return
from the Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing his research and I'm doing mine and we're going to
put our heads together as soon as the game's over,'' Hackett said.
``I think the rumor board says it's top 10 position. That's pretty
safe, but how accurate that is, I have no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Recruit visits: Quarterback Ken Dorsey of Miramonte High in
Orinda, Calif., visited practice Tuesday. Miramonte is also the
alma mater of Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsey visited Miami last weekend and said he will decide
between USC and the Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a quarterback could seem like a daunting task for the
Trojans, who start freshman Carson Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I wouldn't scare anybody away,'' Palmer said. ``It'll
probably be harder to get someone because next year we'll have a
freshman (Jason Thomas), sophomore (Palmer), junior (Mike Van
Raaphorst) and senior (John Fox) at quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowl benefit: Although the Trojans may not be thrilled about
spending a week in El Paso, there is one thing that has excited
some players. Each player will receive a Sony Play Station video
game player as one of the gifts from the Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'll ever leave my house once I get that,''
Palmer said.

EDITORIAL: THE SENATE EDGES TOWARD CENSURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Dec. 23:
</P>
<P>
   The Senate seems inclined to treat Bill Clinton's misconduct in
a fair and responsible way, provided the president will let it do
so. Though Senate sentiment has not yet coalesced around a specific
plan, both Republicans and Democrats are talking of censure as the
most appropriate punishment. For the last couple of days Clinton
and his aides have seemed in better touch with political reality.
They can help keep the Senate on a conciliatory course by
dispensing with the legal quibbling that has helped bring his
presidency to the brink of destruction and by continuing to send
receptive signals about censure.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., the guardian of Senate constancy,
removed a potential roadblock to censure this week by declaring
that a full trial of the charges against Clinton need not be the
only response to the two articles of impeachment approved by the
House. That gives the Senate the latitude to consider a variety of
options that would lead quickly to a strong censure resolution.
Even if a trial must be opened to satisfy the Constitution or
Republican concerns about belittling the House, it could be
terminated at any time by a simple majority vote.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton must recognize that even Senate Democrats who favor
censure are dismayed by his conduct and fed up with his failure to
square himself with the law. The surest way to assemble the 67
votes needed to convict and remove him from office is to treat the
Senate with contempt. White House aides who are so certain the
numbers can never turn against Clinton need only recall their
predictions after the November elections that the House would not
vote to impeach.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers and political advisers who have so poorly served
Clinton must give up the self-defeating idea that they can win this
case through parliamentary maneuvering and legal pettifoggery. Sen.
John Breaux, D-La., offered wise counsel when he urged the White
House not to try to block Senate action by arguing that the
impeachment vote of a lame-duck House has no standing when the new
Congress convenes in January.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, Clinton must discard the empty assertion that
he did not lie under oath before a federal grand jury. Though Byrd
has urged his colleagues to develop their own response without
negotiating with the White House, it seems all but inevitable that
any censure resolution would condemn Clinton for giving false
testimony under oath. Such a resolution would also come with the
expectation that Clinton would publicly accept it. That, in turn,
should be sufficient for Kenneth Starr to promise not to prosecute
Clinton when he leaves the White House.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in weeks, the political dynamic in Washington
is moving toward censuring Clinton. Even some of the moderate House
Republicans who voted for impeachment articles that explicitly call
for his removal from office are now, belatedly, embracing censure.
With some help from Bill Clinton, it could happen soon.

MOST NYC STUDENTS WILL FAIL NEW GRADUATION TESTS, REPORT SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Unless drastic improvements are made, the New York
City school system will fail to insure that students in its worst
schools pass new, tougher high school standards imposed by the
state, a report from a watchdog group says.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Education Association, a nonprofit organization that
monitors school performance, assembled data from a number of
sources and projected that most students in New York City would not
be able to earn a high school diploma under the new state mandates,
which within the next five years will require students to pass
Regents exams covering English, math, American history, global
studies and science. Previously the Regents exams were taken mainly
by college-bound students and were not required for graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew issued a statement Tuesday night
disputing the report. He called the prediction that most students
would not measure up to the graduation requirements ``reckless,''
and said that other organizations had found New York leading other
urban districts on ``virtually every performance indicator.''
</P>
<P>
   The new report shows that students now perform far below the new
state performance standards. In 1997, according to the report's
analysis of State Education Department data, just 18 percent of
city students passed the Regents exam in biology, compared with 58
percent in the rest of the state, and 39 percent passed the English
exam, compared with 65 percent outside of the city. Both will be
mandatory for a high school diploma in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   The report was sponsored by the Center for Civic Innovation at
the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research organization, and
the Program on Education and Civil Society, a research group at New
York University.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond J. Domanico, executive director of the Public Education
Association, said that taken together, the data should provide
parents and policy makers greater resolve to reverse the school
system's lag behind the state and, in some cases, the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wake-up call for the city,'' Domanico said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   In the 14 lowest-performing community school districts, which
are also the poorest, 37.8 percent of third graders read at or
above grade level, while the rest of the 32 districts averaged 56.5
percent _ a gap that has hardly changed in the last three years,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1989 and 1997 the percentage of students who earned a
high school diploma within four years increased to 45 percent from
39 percent, and those who earned a diploma within seven years
increased to 60 percent from 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although Domanico lauded the improvement, he said it was
astounding that 40 percent of the students did not earn a diploma.

DAVID JACKSON, 96, EX-GOVERNOR OF THE AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David S. Jackson, a member of the American Stock Exchange for 73
years and an exchange governor from 1965 to 1968, died Sunday, a
son-in-law, Andrew Segal, said. Jackson was 96.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who was born in Manhattan, joined the exchange in 1925,
working as a specialist. By 1930, when he married Freda King, he
had made his first million. In 1931, during the second wave of the
stock market crash, he lost most of his money but subsequently
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson came into the limelight in 1955 as a result of a Sunday
night broadcast by Walter Winchell during which Winchell ``tipped''
Pantepee Oil stock as a recommendation to his audience. At the
time, Jackson was the specialist in the stock. Public reaction was
so great that Jackson risked his own finances by selling the stock
short to meet the surge of demand. In large part because of
Jackson's selling, the stock did not rise significantly. In the
following week, it fell, and Jackson made $50,000 after buying back
shares to cover his short position.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was not shy about taking risks or making his views
known. In 1969, he was openly critical of the exchange's
administration and sought the resignation of its president, Edward
T. McCormick, contending that the exchange had not dealt promptly
with a specialist who had been enjoined for securities violations
by the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was angered that the injunction was never formally
brought to the attention of the general membership. The exchange
eventually appointed a special committee that rewrote the exchange
constitution, and both McCormick and his board resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson; Ralph Saul, a former SEC commissioner, and the
Securities and Exchange Commission later rewrote the rules that
governed specialists' obligations and trading rules.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's other interests were as diverse as ballet, fishing,
horse racing, bridge and travel in France.
</P>
<P>
   He retired from active work in 1971, but his firm, Jackson &AMP;
Segal, continued until 1982. Subsequently, Jackson retained his
seat privileges on the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is survived by his wife, Freda, and two daughters, Linda
Segal of New York and Nancy Godwin of Paris.

 &HT;    Firefighters borrow van, help fellow heroes save 2 lives
 &HT;    By R. Robin McDonald
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ DeKalb County firefighters who had to drive a personal
van to a house fire because their firetruck was broken arrived just
in time to assist in the rescue of an unconscious 6-year-old child
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Four firefighters already there from another station also saved
a 62-year-old paraplegic man who was trapped in the house in south
DeKalb.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked as a team today as much as we ever did in our
lives,'' said Lt. William Smith of Fire Station No. 6, the first of
two stations to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   He and firefighters from his station handed the child, Larry
Battle, through a window to the three firefighters who arrived by
van minutes later. They carried the man, George Durham, down the
stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking oil meant for french fries most likely caused the blaze,
DeKalb Interim Fire Chief John Baskett said.
</P>
<P>
   Paramedics said that both Durham's heart and the child's had
stopped, and both suffered smoke inhalation. Durham also suffered
burns. Firefighters and paramedics resuscitated both victims, who
were in Grady Memorial Hospital's burn unit in critical condition
Tuesday evening, said John Styron, a division chief with DeKalb
Emergency Medical Services.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Lester Maddox (no relation to the former Georgia governor)
said he and his crew drove three miles in a van owned by another
firefighter after their only fire engine began leaking fluid
Tuesday morning. When the fire call came in, a maintenance crew was
working on the truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We loaded our gear up and put it in the van,'' Maddox said.
``We knew with an entrapment, they needed extra help.''

FIRST WOMAN TO COMMAND DETECTIVES IN N.Y. TAKES A POST IN
MASSACHUSETTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By AMY WALDMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Deputy Chief Jane Perlov, who was the first woman to
command a borough's detectives in the New York Police Department,
will leave the city next month to take the highest-ranking public
safety job in Massachusetts, officials announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Perlov's new appointment was announced at a news conference in
Boston on Tuesday by Acting Gov. Argeo Paul Cellucci. In a
telephone interview Tuesday night, Perlov, 42, said she had a
``heavy heart'' about leaving the New York Police Department, but
called the chance to join Cellucci's cabinet an ``incredible
honor'' that was too good to pass up. In her new position she will
oversee 20 public safety agencies in Massachusetts and have the
opportunity to shape legislation in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a wonderful thing for someone who's been a career
police officer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Perlov joined the Police Department in 1981, quickly rising
through the ranks to become a captain and the first woman to
command the 20th Precinct, which covers Manhattan's Upper West
Side. In 1995, she was promoted to the rank of inspector and tapped
to lead the 30th Precinct in Harlem, which had been rocked by one
of the worst police corruption scandals in the city's history.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, she was named the commanding officer of
detectives in Queens, making her the first female detective
commander and among the department's highest-ranking women.
</P>
<P>
   Perlov, who is married to a police sergeant, was born in
Bayside, Queens, and moved to Central Park West with her family as
a teen-ager. The second of three daughters born to a financial
analyst and a manager, she was encouraged by her parents to become
a doctor or a lawyer. Instead, she became a police officer _ the
first in her family.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother cried the day she graduated from the Police Academy,
but Tuesday, Perlov said, her mother was ``incredibly proud _ she's
busting.'' Then again, she said, ``she's been busting for years
now.''

3RD NEW YORK FIREFIGHTER IS HONORED AND BURIED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHARLIE LEDUFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALVERNE, N.Y. _ They came by airplane and bus and automobile.
They came dressed in their navy blues with their hats on. Some
brought their sons.
</P>
<P>
   Snapping flags at half-staff lined the route Tuesday for the
funeral cortege in this small western Long Island town. Lt. Joseph
Cavalieri was the last of three New York City firefighters to be
buried after their lives ended in a wall of fire on Friday morning
as they tried to save an elderly woman from her burning Brooklyn
apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   His two comrades, James Bohan and Christopher Bopp, were laid to
rest Monday, and the magnitude of the week's loss streaked tears
across the rugged and clean-shaven faces of firefighters who came
from across the continent, from as far way as the Yukon Territory
and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``All three of these men and their families lost everything,''
said Dan McMurray, a firefighter from Toronto, in a raw, croaking
voice. ``We do this job for our families, and when one loses, we
all lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The three men were assigned to Ladder Company 170 in Canarsie,
Brooklyn, and had tried to save a 67-year-old woman who, fire
officials believe, had started the fire by dropping a cigarette in
her apartment. Cavalieri, 42, who had been highly decorated, was
leading his two colleagues in the search for trapped people,
including the woman. The men did not know that she had taken refuge
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   While they were struggling through the heavy smoke on the 10th
floor at 17 Vandalia Ave., high winds from an open door caused a
fireball to shoot down the hall like a bullet down the barrel of a
gun, fire officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have also discovered that the sprinkler system was not
working, but finger-pointing and recrimination were absent Tuesday
as people came to remember and honor a brave man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a great man, a better guy than I'll ever be,'' said
Firefighter Joe Tursi, who worked in the Canarsie firehouse with
Cavalieri. ``It's tough, but we go on because it's our job.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a coarse and rainy day for a funeral. It began with a
procession from the Malverne Funeral Home led by a motorcade,
followed by a ladder truck from Company 170, then the Pipe and Drum
Corps and, finally, the fire engine carrying the draped casket of
Cavalieri.
</P>
<P>
   As the Rev. Donald Baier waited with clasped hands in the
whipping wind at Our Lady of Lourdes Roman Catholic Church, the
gravity of the spectacle bore down on the crowd of about 8,000, and
some winced.
</P>
<P>
   Just before 11 a.m., the bell began to toll and the color guard
marched from the church. A crisp salute was offered from the sea of
blue. One solemn piper played ``Amazing Grace'' as the casket was
carried up the steps of the church. At the entrance to the
sanctuary, Cavalieri's widow wept.
</P>
<P>
   Cavalieri was the 770th firefighter in New York City history to
die in the line of duty. His name will be added to the Wall of
Honor at the department's headquarters in downtown Brooklyn.

ALLAN D'ARCANGELO, 68, PAINTER OF POP IMAGES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Allan D'Arcangelo, a painter known for pared-down
images of highways and road signs that neatly split the difference
between Pop Art and Minimalism, died on Dec. 17 at Beth Israel
North in Manhattan. He was 68 and lived on an 80-acre farm in the
Catskills, near Kenoza Lake, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was leukemia, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   D'Arcangelo was born in Buffalo in 1930, the son of Italian
immigrants. He received a bachelor's degree in history at the
University of Buffalo in 1953 and briefly considered law school.
</P>
<P>
   But an interest in culture drew him to Manhattan, where he
studied writing at the New School and education at City College and
started visiting art galleries where he encountered the work of the
Abstract Expressionists.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief stint in the Army in the mid-1950s, he used the GI
Bill to study painting at Mexico City College for two years,
returning to New York in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Until then he had worked in a roughly painted figurative style
that had affinities to folk art. But he soon responded to the cool
sensibility that was emerging in the work of artists like Andy
Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of his first solo show, at the Fischbach Gallery in
1963, he had reduced his forms to geometric shapes and adopted as
his subject the American highway, plunging toward the distant
horizon between crisp straight lines.
</P>
<P>
   These works were well received and earned D'Arcangelo a place in
the first generation of Pop artists. His efforts were often linked
to the American Precisionists and shared some of the graphic
flatness of Hard-Edge paintings and the simple industrial forms of
Minimalism. But they also had an air of slightly morose desolation
and vastness, and it made sense that D'Arcangelo often cited de
Chirico as one of his main influences.
</P>
<P>
   D'Arcangelo exhibited regularly in Europe and New York
throughout the 1960s and joined the Marlborough Gallery in 1971.
Starting with the 1964 New York World's Fair, he executed numerous
mural commissions, both public and private. He taught throughout
his career, most consistently at the School of Visual Arts (1963-68
and 1982-92) and Brooklyn College (1973-92).
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, D'Arcangelo moved to his farm near Kenoza
Lake, where he continued to paint in a style that was at first more
realistic and then became gradually rougher and more primitive. His
life-long interest in ancient cultures was also expressed in a
natural stone compass rose, or sun clock, measuring 40 feet in
diameter, that he built on his land.
</P>
<P>
   D'Arcangelo's marriage to Sylvia Resnick ended in divorce. He is
survived by a son, Gideon, of Brooklyn; a daughter, Gabrielle
Walters of Chico, Calif.; a brother, Mark, of Fairfield, Conn., and
a sister, Bernadette Gorski, of Cheshire, Conn.

ANXIOUS 4TH GRADERS PREP FOR STANDARDIZED TESTS, RAISING A FEW
DOUBTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In any other year, this would be a light week in Roz
Sacharoff's fourth-grade classroom, with Christmas-around-the-world
lunches and holiday songs the order of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, like a coach getting a team ready for the Super Bowl,
Sacharoff has been preparing her students for the biggest test of
their 9-year-old lives: New York state's new fourth-grade reading
exam, which will be given over three consecutive days beginning on
Jan. 12 and which will be used to measure their school's
effectiveness. In case anyone is counting, and the students
certainly are, that's just a week after they return from Christmas
break, which begins at the final bell Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As the 31 denizens of Room 218 at Public School 46 looked to the
future this week, their mood was anything but festive.
</P>
<P>
   Davon Livingston, 9, said he felt ``nauseous.'' Elizabeth
Petronio, also 9, said she was anticipating that she would be ``too
scared to go to bed early'' and would find herself up at 3 a.m. on
the day of the test. And Patrick McGreevy was worried about his
handwriting; no small matter, considering that in addition to
shading columns of small bubbles, the students will be asked, for
the first time on a state test, to take notes and answer essay
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am really scared,'' said Patrick, 9, his brown hair cropped
short and his eyes obscured by thick wire-rimmed lenses. ``I want
to get into a very good college. You must know the name of it:
Harvard.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was high anxiety this week at P.S. 46 and at other
elementary schools around New York City and across the state, it
was largely because they had been asked to do so much in so little
time. In past years, the state administered its standardized
reading test in the spring, giving teachers at least three more
months to prepare students.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in addition to insuring their students' ability to read a
short passage and then sift out the main idea, a staple of previous
tests, the teachers must also make sure that their students can
absorb the details of a fable that has been read to them and then
construct meaningful sentences in response. The pressure will be
intense, spread out over three days in sessions that, for the first
time, will be timed, at an average of about 55 minutes each.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that teaching students how to relax through deep
breathing is now part of the daily fourth-grade curriculum at
another city school, P.S. 125 in Harlem, called the Ralph Bunche
School. On every Saturday morning since October, the school has
held intensive two-hour test preparation sessions, with as many as
half of the school's 200 fourth graders showing up at any one time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're being sent home with a holiday package that details
the things they should be doing every day, like sample questions,''
said the principal, Lauvia Sherman.
</P>
<P>
   But at nearby P.S. 123, whose strong performance on last year's
test lifted it off the state failing list for the first time in
seven years, such a packet will be unnecessary. While students
elsewhere will be losing themselves in the new video games and
Furbys that appeared under their Christmas trees, fourth graders at
P.S. 123 have been invited to attend school for three hours a day
during next week's vacation _ all in an attempt to keep the
momentum going in anticipation of the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're offering them an opportunity to have a place to come, if
they feel they want extra help or if they want to practice,'' said
the principal, Edith Bly-Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   So far, about 60 of 120 fourth graders have signaled their
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Much is riding on their answers. Though it will be at least
another year before Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew begins holding
fourth graders back based on their test scores, he intends to use
this year's scores in part to judge the performance of teachers,
principals and superintendents. Moreover, the state will use the
scores to determine whether a school is failing _ the dreaded
scarlet ``SURR,'' for Schools Under Registration Review _ a
designation that can lead to the transfers of teachers and
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Some public middle schools intend to use the scores as criteria
for admission.
</P>
<P>
   To Peter W. Cookson, a professor of education at Teachers
College at Columbia University and the author of ``A Parent's Guide
to Standardized Tests in School'' (Learning Express), the state has
overreached in asking 9- and 10-year-olds to sit for three days of
such ``high stakes testing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mismatch between what some adults imagine education
ought to be _ this sort of corporatist, bottom-line, quantifiable
outcome _ and any real understanding of what kids need in their
developmental life,'' Cookson said.
</P>
<P>
   Told by a reporter about the concerns of Davon, Elizabeth and
Patrick, the state education commissioner, Richard P. Mills, said
he was pained.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could,'' he said, ``I would reach into every classroom
and tell the children not to be anxious about this. The early
results this year will be much lower than we would first want. It's
a much harder test, and it is intended to be.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he had no doubt they were up to the task.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to need the knowledge and skills tested here,''
he said. ``We are going to have to be patient but also consistent
in our expectation that they actually rise to this level of
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this has been lost on Sacharoff, who has been teaching
fourth grade for seven years at P.S. 46, a red-brick schoolhouse
surrounded by neat red-brick-and-aluminum two-family homes.
</P>
<P>
   Though the school _ many of whose students are recent immigrants
from China, Korea, Japan and South America _ ranked 25th in the
city on last year's reading test, with 84 percent of its students
at or above grade level, Sacharoff and the school's new principal,
JoAnn Consentino, are taking nothing for granted.
</P>
<P>
   She said she has told her students the test would assess skills
they work on every day: distinguishing fact from fiction, putting
the events or ideas of a story into sequence, inferring the
writer's meaning.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, during a one-hour lesson on note taking, the section
of the test that Sacharoff's students have found most foreign, the
teacher did not refer to the exam. But she didn't have to, the
students said later. They knew from her demeanor that they had
serious work to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone show me their `listening posture,' '' Sacharoff
instructed, and she was quickly greeted by the sound of
metal-legged chairs scraping along tile, as the students pulled up
to their varnished-wood desks.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a drill closely matching what the students will be
asked to do on the second day of the test, Sacharoff told her
students to put their pencils away and listen. Instructing them to
be careful to make eye contact with her, she read them a short
story, ``Amos and Boris,'' about a mouse (Amos) who fell off a
sailboat and was rescued by a whale (Boris), only to repay the
favor years later when Boris became beached near Amos' home.
</P>
<P>
   After reading, Sacharoff asked her students to take notes, but
using a specific format, first noting the events in the story that
related to each character and then using those details to describe
the personality traits of the whale and the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   In a clear script that should cause him little problem on the
state test, Patrick noted that Amos was ``good hearted'' because
``he was kind enough to save Boris' life.'' Elizabeth, who feared
having sleepless nights next month, also performed well, suggesting
that Amos was ``loyal'' because ``he kept his promise to Boris that
he would be there when he needed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sacharoff was pleased with her students' performance and told
them so, but in the teachers' lounge later, she said it was a
struggle to allay their fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a nervous wreck,'' she said. ``I will take the results
personally.''

LOCAL POLICE TAKE BIGGER ROLE IN SHOPPING-MALL SECURITY
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODBRIDGE, N.J. _ Michael Dalia has spent 21 years with the
Woodbridge Police Department, and he was not inclined to take any
chances with the little girl sticking her head through a railing on
the upstairs level of the Woodbridge Center mall, even if her
mother was over on a bench just a few steps away, chatting with a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' he said softly. ``Watch your head there, sweetheart.''
</P>
<P>
   The little girl, 3-year-old Brielle Trocchia of Brooklyn,
smiled. Her mother smiled. Dalia nodded and moved on, continuing a
routine that was as common as crowds at Christmas and yet a part of
a growing trend in law enforcement: the public police officer
patrolling the private territory of the mall.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey and around the country, local police forces in the
last few years have become, in essence, full-time security
contractors (although they do not like that word) to mall
operators, supplementing private security officers.
</P>
<P>
   Malls increasingly provide police with fully equipped
substations, police cars and salaries _ often plus an
``administrative fee'' that comes back to the police department as
a kind of profit. In exchange, trained, sworn and armed officers
walk beats that may take in little more than the tiled floors
between Sears at one end and Macy's at the other.
</P>
<P>
   Their presence has been credited with curtailing crime in a way
that private, unarmed security guards cannot do. And they do more:
they reassure shoppers who tend to get nervous when they hear news
reports of purse snatchers on the escalators or rapists in the
parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every study ever done about how people choose where to shop
have `security' and `safety' at the top of the list,'' said Amy
McQueeney, vice president and general manager of Woodbridge Center.
</P>
<P>
   While the practice has generally been cleared by state law, the
use of private money to pay for public police has nevertheless
raised questions. In February, for instance, New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani was sharply criticized for approving a plan by a
business improvement district to pay $5 million for a police
substation in the Wall Street area. Community groups complained
that officers would be drained from more dangerous precincts to
patrol one of the safest areas in the city.
</P>
<P>
   But police officials say that having officers at malls is just
an extension of the community policing concept that has been
credited with helping to reduce crime rates across the country. And
they insist that the practice does not raise questions of social
equity _ police protection for those who can afford it, diminishing
protection for those who cannot _ because everyone benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our responsibility is to provide safety and security for the
city of Stamford, period,'' said Chief Dean Esserman of the
Stamford, Conn., Police Department, whose five district offices are
all provided free by merchants, and which routinely contracts for
uniformed police on overtime, or ``extra duty'' in the department's
parlance, to patrol the Stamford Center mall and other private
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   And suburban police officials say it makes sense to send
officers to malls, which have become the equivalent of downtown
shopping streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where the people are,'' said Philip Dinicola, deputy
police chief in Woodbridge, about 25 miles southwest of Manhattan,
``so this is where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the mall policing is done either by additional officers
hired to handle the load, or by officers volunteering for the
overtime, the practice does not take police away from other parts
of town, police officials said. Police officials also said they had
had no complaints from merchants outside the mall about the
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can only help us here on Main Street if the shoppers in any
part of Woodbridge feel safer,'' said Lee Nevez, a jewelry store
owner who is president of Woodbridge's Downtown Merchants'
Association.
</P>
<P>
   With the Christmas season at its peak, Woodbridge Center now has
four officers and one plainclothes detective assigned there full
time, said James Davy, the town administrator. The mall also
recently bought a new, $31,000 police cruiser and built a police
substation that it equipped with computers, radios and booking
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is almost universally the case that there is some kind of
formal partnership between the local police and a shopping center
these days,'' said Jonathan Lusher, a vice president of IPC
International, of Bannockburn, Ill., consultants on mall security.
``It runs from an occasional off-duty cop to many places where
there are full-time police officers paid for by the mall. The
Glendale Galleria in California has six full-time cops and a
precinct house, for example.''
</P>
<P>
   The contract municipal police supplement what is always a much
bigger private security force in the mall, Lusher said. Over all,
he said, security costs at a major mall typically run $1 million a
year or more, often exceeding costs for services such as
maintenance, since the publicity of even one notorious incident _
an abduction or carjacking, say _ could cost a mall far more in
lost business.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers first started coming into malls informally about
five years ago, police experts say, after several highly publicized
abductions in shopping malls around the country, including that in
1992 of Gail Shollar, of Edison, N.J., who was seized with her
3-year-old daughter at the nearby Middlesex Mall and killed. The
daughter was unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of those attacks, the police started patrolling
parking lots, and then gradually went indoors. At the same time,
said Dinicola, malls began offering police substations inside
malls, where police could book shoplifting suspects in less than
half an hour instead of the three hours it would take to do
everything downtown.

UNDATED: everything downtown. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At some malls, that occasional drop-in by the police has become
a permanent, paid relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Kevin Kilduff of the Clarkstown, N.Y., police said an
opinion from the Attorney General Dennis Vacco's office had cleared
the way for departments like his to deploy regular paid patrols at
local malls. (The attorney general's office did not return phone
calls.) The New Jersey attorney general's office said the question
had not come up.
</P>
<P>
   Kilduff, who assigns officers to two malls, Palisades Center and
Nanuet Mall, said that under the Vacco opinion, a mall ``can put in
payment in the form of a donation to the police departments and we
assign people down there on a mutually agreeable schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the arrangements are public, malls and police
departments are circumspect when it comes to discussing the
finances in detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a little bit private,'' Kilduff said. He would say,
however, that his two malls pay the town about $65 per hour per
officer, which covers the officer's overtime rate plus
administrative costs. At that rate, two officers on duty for eight
hours a day Friday through Sunday would cost the malls more more
than $6,200 a week, or some $320,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Woodbridge Township officials refused to disclose how much the
mall there was paying for police coverage, but Dinicola, the
Woodbridge deputy chief, says the benefits to the mall are
considerable.
</P>
<P>
   The mall gets quicker response to the car thefts, shoplifting,
purse snatching and simple assaults that are almost daily
occurrences at malls everywhere, he said. At Woodbridge Center,
according to statistics released by the police, reports of
everything from robberies to auto theft to weapons possession
decreased by 27 percent from the year ending June 1992, before
police patrolling became full time, to the year ending last June.
</P>
<P>
   And the mall gets happier customers: ``High visibility displaces
crime,'' Dinicola said. ``And high visibility also offers a level
of comfort to citizens who just want to get their shopping done.''

BANK OF JAPAN DEFENDS ITS FINANCIAL STABILITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Fending off weeks of criticism that the Japanese central
bank's financial strength is eroding, the bank's governor said
Tuesday that it had one of the world's safest pools of assets,
second only to that of the U.S. Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks by Masaru Hayami, governor of the Bank of Japan,
were an effort to bolster Japan's international image in the
financial world and allay fears of investors at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The concerns have been growing because Japan continues to be
mired in its worst recession in six decades and because the
government has said it would use the cash it controls to revive the
economy rather than to buy up big blocks of government bonds. Fears
that private investors will not have the appetite to buy the large
number of the government bonds that remain helped send bond prices
plummeting this week.
</P>
<P>
   The government on Monday proposed a record budget for next year
and said it would issue a record amount of new bonds to finance the
outlays. That has stirred alarm that a flood of government bonds
would push down bond prices and raise yields and long-term interest
rates. Higher rates could stifle an economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond rose 25
basis points, to 1.75 percent, and was as high as 1.8 percent at
one point. Some analysts have projected that long-term yields could
surge past 2 percent soon.
</P>
<P>
   Private economists have also been concerned that the Bank of
Japan has been expanding beyond its means, pouring money into
lower-quality securities that could end up nibbling away at its
solid reputation.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Japan's troubles underscore the problems that the
nation as a whole is facing. Japan is caught in a series of binds,
choosing between worsening the recession or worsening its fiscal
balances, and the central bank is torn between preserving its
high-quality balance sheet and intervening by lending to troubled
corporations and institutions that desperately need cash.
</P>
<P>
   (On Wednesday, Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp. lowered its credit
ratings for seven of Japan's 10 largest banks: Sumitomo Bank Ltd;
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd.; Sakura Bank Ltd.; Sanwa Bank Ltd.;
Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd.; Tokai Bank Ltd., and Daiwa Bank Ltd.
``Although the six-month results were generally in line with
expectations, all of the banks, except Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and
Fuji Bank, announced expectations of sharply increased credit costs
in the second half of the year,'' the credit-rating agency said in
a statement.)
</P>
<P>
   Hayami acknowledged the concerns among private economists that
the Bank of Japan's rapid expansion of lending, which is intended
to inject money into the financial system, might increase the
bank's bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   With Japan stuck in its worst recession since the end of World
War II and with banks cutting loans and selling assets in a
struggle for survival, the Bank of Japan has had to step in as the
lender of last resort to corporations caught in a credit squeeze.
The bank, which has always been lauded for its prudent management,
has come under attack since it decided last month to ease credit by
loosening its open-market operations.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Bank of Japan, which typically puts more than
two-thirds of its funds into top-rated Japanese government bonds,
has been placing more money in securities sold by lower-quality,
cash-starved corporations. Over the last year, the Bank of Japan
has stepped in repeatedly to pour liquidity into the financial
system. And as a result, its assets have expanded to 88.3 trillion
yen, or $765 billion, a hefty 40 percent rise from last November.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some economists are worried that the burden of bad loans
that has crippled the nation's giant banks will in part be
transferred to the Bank of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But Hayami pointed out that European central banks do not own as
high a percentage of government bonds as does the Bank of Japan,
and that they instead often inject money into the financial system
by buying corporate commercial paper. Only the U.S. Federal
Reserve, he said, had a higher proportion of its assets in
government bonds.

NEW YORK'S CHARITY SANTAS AND HUSTLERS ARE POLES APART
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Santa needs help,'' Juan Lebron shouted to the
people slowly shuffling past him near the Rockefeller Center
Christmas tree.
</P>
<P>
   He was working the crowd as an elf for the Volunteers of
America, taking instant pictures of passers-by posing with the more
or less jolly old gent. ``Put your donation in the chimney, then
you can take a picture with Santa. Santa needs your help.''
</P>
<P>
   Santa _ Tony Serrano when he's not decked out in a white beard
and red suit _ can usually take care of himself, as when a
teen-ager wearing a jester hat sidled up.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I want for Christmas?'' the jester teased. ``Where's
the gift for me?''
</P>
<P>
   While someone in the crowd muttered, ``You're gonna lose that
hat,'' Serrano just fixed a silent stare on the smart aleck, who
got the message and drifted away.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad Serrano did not have the same effect on his competition.
On the blocks around the big tree, there were freelance Santas
everywhere _ break dancing, drumming or just posing _ all cashing
in on the holiday. This is not necessarily illegal, although two
men were recently arrested on fraud charges for posing as
Volunteers of America Sidewalk Santas. But the bell ringers who
raise money for charity see no magic in the marketplace, since
collections, and consequently their spirits, were down this year,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of his nine-hour shift on Sunday night, Lebron had
collected $600, a disappointing drop from last year's usual daily
take of $1,000. It bothers him, because the money he collects helps
feed the needy. This is no small thing for him, since he was once
homeless and hungry, so it angers him to see a crush of Kringle
competitors looking out only for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got hip to our program and they feel it's easy money,''
Lebron said. ``They're out here to make a buck. If they were out to
help different programs, that's cool. I wouldn't have a beef with
that. But when you're selfish and doing it for yourself, I can't
respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Respect is on Serrano's mind a lot when he's out on the street
collecting money by his little red chimney, where a sign says
``Help Our Neediest Neighbors.'' Yet some people wearing fur coats
and jewelry come up and try to snap his picture without making a
small donation. Sometimes he stops jiggling, turns his back to them
and points at the sign. When a dollar goes into the slot, he starts
to dance and smile again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't they read?'' he said. ``The sign says `Help.' I
represent the poor. They want to see me, they have to pay me.
That's New York style. You have to get that straightened out when
it comes to reality. I'm here to teach them respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Serrano _ who calls himself Robot because he dances like one _
can charm crying toddlers into smiling and coax dollars from their
parents. He can also size up wise guys who might try to swipe his
beard or his floppy red cap. He has to be patient, yet firm. Jolly,
but not a jerk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep my arms down so I can block them like with a style of
karate,'' he said. ``It's not wise to let people get too close. You
do have people with a bad attitude. They think it's funny whenever
bad things happen to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Serrano and Lebron know that misfortune is no joke. Both of
them had had rocky times. They are now, with the help of the
Volunteers of America, back on their feet, and they see their bell
ringing as a way of helping others get a bit of the luck they've
had.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that personal understanding also helps explain why many of
their donations come from people who don't have that much
themselves. Lebron said working people who live from check to check
usually give more often than others. They know their lives can slip
into turmoil pretty easily, he said. One woman who lived in a
shelter donated $10 a few weeks ago, but Lebron insisted she take
back $5.
</P>
<P>
   Lebron has come pretty far this year. He moved into a new
apartment in East Harlem, where he sometimes listens to tapes of
some tunes he sang with different salsa bands and dreams of being
discovered by a record producer. Should he wonder why he is
spending more time on the sidewalk with Santa than he does in the
studio with his music, a glance around his new neighborhood reminds
him for whom the bell tolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see my face and hear my voice because I lived through
it,'' he said. ``I like dealing with situations like this.
Somebody's got to do it. Like Robot says, somebody's got to ring
the bell. Somebody's got to be the voice of our community.''

ADVERTISING: NEW VH1 CAMPAIGN FEATURES ROCK ICONS
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are those few who are actually on a first-name
basis with the royalty of rock 'n' roll, who can talk truthfully
about trips with Mick or Keith, dinners with Mariah or Shania and
parties with Pete or John or Jewel. (Well, maybe Jewel is an
exception, because everyone would by definition be on a first-name
basis with a one-name celebrity.)
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to seem part of the rocknoscenti but have
only been as close to a rock star as an orchestra seat in an
amphitheater can get them, there is VH1, the music cable network.
After years of struggling, VH1 has recently started to prosper by
narrowing its focus to programs that offer viewers what are billed
as intimate inside glimpses at the lives and careers of the most
popular and successful singers and songwriters.
</P>
<P>
   Now VH1 is seeking to capitalize on recent gains in viewership
and advertising revenue with a campaign that is intended to
solidify an image as the best way to, as the ads put it, ``go
behind the music.''
</P>
<P>
   In a series of commercials that are scheduled to begin appearing
Saturday, Mick (Jagger) and Keith (Richards), Mariah (Carey) and
Shania (Twain) and Pete (Townshend), John (Mellencamp) and Jewel
(uh, Jewel), are presented in casual settings, chatting in a
revelatory manner about their music. The spots, with a budget
estimated at $15 million to $17 million, are the first work for VH1
from Rubin Postaer &AMP; Associates in Santa Monica, Calif., which was
selected in April after a review to create an image campaign for
the network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to send a simple, clear message that backs up our
strongest programming attribute, that we keep our viewers _ the
young professionals in their 20s and 30s _ in touch with the bands,
the music,'' said John Sykes, the New York-based president of VH1,
part of the MTV Networks unit of Viacom Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make a lot of noise,'' he added, referring to
extensive promotion campaigns, ``but if the programming is not in
place, the viewers will sample and then go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the programs that have kept VH1 from falling into the more
obscure corners of cable now dense with home-shopping and
public-access channels are ``Behind the Music,'' ``Legends,''
``Storytellers'' and ``Pop-Up Video.''
</P>
<P>
   And a concert in April, ``VH1 Divas Live,'' featuring Ms. Carey,
Ms. Twain and the sister sirens Aretha Franklin, Celine Dion,
Gloria Estefan and Carole King proved popular enough to spin off a
compact disk that has shipped two million copies worldwide on the
Epic Records label, according to Sykes.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials were created by Rubin Postaer and a director,
Jon Kane, in a style meant to evoke the forthcoming, backstage tone
and tenor of the VH1 programs. The singers, shot in black and
white, speak in an off-the-cuff manner that is underlined by jump
cuts punctuating their remarks. Each spot ends with the theme ``Go
behind the music'' superimposed on screen along with the VH1 logo
and the network's slogan, ``Music first.''
</P>
<P>
   Jagger, for instance, is seen standing in front of the windows
of what seems to be a hotel room. ``I never intended to be a sex
symbol,'' he declares. ``I thought of myself as a serious musician
and I didn't want to be a stripper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But then in the end,'' he adds, ``I turned out to be just
another girl out on the runway.''
</P>
<P>
   The other commercials include Ms. Carey, in a swimming pool,
discussing how her first album was written ``in the back of a wood
shop''; Richards, on a jet, describing how he accidentally
rediscovered the opening of ``(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction'' on
what was thought to be a blank tape, and Townshend, tracing the
roots of his techniques of playing _ and smashing _ the guitar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a concerted effort not to craft the advertising,''
said Lance Bustrum, senior account planner at Rubin Postaer. ``We
wanted the artists to talk in a way that personalizes them. It
feels very real because the moments were real.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was interesting to see the reaction to the commercials we
were getting in viewer research,'' he added. ``People who know the
network said, `That's what I love about it,' and people who are not
so familiar with VH1 said, `I've got to check this stuff out.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sykes said that one goal of the campaign was ``to get some of
the `Nielsen occasionals' to watch us a little bit more,'' using
TV-executive argot for infrequent viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials will run through January on broadcast TV
stations in 23 markets that account for 70 percent of the VH1
viewer base of 65 million cable households, during station breaks
on series like ``Frasier'' and ``Friends.'' They will also appear
on national cable networks like A&AMP;E; ESPN; Comedy Central, which
Viacom owns with Time Warner Inc., and other cable networks owned
by Viacom: MTV, Nick At Nite and TV Land.
</P>
<P>
   There will also be a poster campaign to supplement the
commercials, Sykes said.
</P>
<P>
   The spots will, of course, also run on VH1. ``Viewers will be
rewarded with a couple of extras they'll get to see'' only on that
network, Bustrum said. And Sykes said that plans called for
outtakes from the commercials ``to be posted on our Web site'' at
www.vh1.com.

EDITORIAL: TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Wednesday, Dec. 23:
</P>
<P>
   It is tempting to regard the eight babies born to a Houston
mother as a holiday season miracle, the fruit of a woman's fervent
desire to have children and of modern medicine's ability to assist
reproduction in those otherwise unable to conceive. Who does not
root strenuously for the survival of the world's only known living
octuplets as they cling tenuously to life in a neonatal intensive
care unit? But this is not an event that should be overly
sentimentalized or glamorized. It is instead a mixed blessing,
illustrating the limitations of high-tech medicine as it strives to
bring sound, healthy babies into the world without generating a
crowd of fragile newborns.
</P>
<P>
   The incidence of multiple births has been soaring, and one of
the prime causes is greater use of fertility drugs and other
technologies to assist reproduction. Although the vast majority of
prospective parents are seeking only one healthy baby, or perhaps
two, the drugs carry a risk that many more fertilized eggs will be
produced, leading to such large broods as the septuplets born in
Iowa last year and the eight births in Houston this month.
</P>
<P>
   Both sets of births attracted a flood of attention from the
media and from companies eager to supply free groceries or baby
supplies for a share of the publicity. Record-setting multiple
births are admittedly hard to ignore. But this trend should not be
encouraged. Such multiple births are dangerous to the babies, who
are born so tiny and premature that they are at high risk of
lifetime health complications. Even if the babies emerge healthy,
the parents are faced with an enormous burden of care that few are
prepared to meet without outside assistance. Moreover, the cost of
multiple births is very high and can be greatly reduced if the
number of babies is reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say there are several ways to avoid such multiple
births, none of them infallible. One is to monitor the fertility
drug treatments very closely and, if it becomes clear that too many
eggs are maturing at once, terminate the treatment cycle
immediately. That amounts to a costly misfire for the patient but
stops the process before an egg is fertilized to produce an embryo,
making the termination morally acceptable to many patients.
</P>
<P>
   A more controversial technique, employed after there are
multiple embryos or fetuses, is ``selective reduction'' to remove
some. That gives the remaining embryos a better chance but is
opposed by some women as tantamount to abortion. Some experts would
limit the most aggressive use of fertility drugs to those women
whose moral beliefs allow them to undertake selective reduction,
whereas others urge more research on new means to prevent the
maturing of too many eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Until scientists come up with a better way to limit multiple
births, the only hope for improvement is the common sense of
doctors and their patients. That can best be brought to bear in an
atmosphere that recognizes that these events, however wondrous they
may seem, are really medical mishaps that few doctors or patients
desire.

N.Y. SENATE REPUBLICANS PUSH STATE'S FIRST TAX-DEDUCTION FOR
COLLEGE TUITION
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Republican leaders of the State Senate say they intend to
push a far-reaching plan through the legislature that would, for
the first time, provide a tax deduction for the payment of college
tuition.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, one of the few of its kind in the nation, would
allow all New York taxpayers who live or work in the state to
deduct the full annual cost of college tuition from their taxable
state income, regardless of how much they earn. The deduction would
apply to the payment of tuition at any accredited college or
university, or professional or trade school, in the United States
or abroad. But it would not cover money spent on books, room and
board, and other educational fees.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, for example, a family of four with a gross
income of $55,000 a year and paying the average tuition of $12,000
a year at a private college would reduce their taxable state income
to $43,000, assuming there were no other deductions. That, in turn,
would reduce their annual state tax bill to $1,289 from $1,769, a
saving of $480.
</P>
<P>
   That same family, paying the $3,400 tuition at one of the public
state colleges, would reduce their tax bill by $136 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, estimated to cost the state $275 million in unpaid
taxes by the 2002-03 fiscal year, represents the opening bid in
what is likely to be a contentious debate over how the state should
use its 1999 budget surplus, which is estimated to be as much as $2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in the Legislature have already begun staking their
claims on the surplus, suggesting that the money be spent on
repairing or replacing many of the state's dilapidated schools,
among other things.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans in the Senate say they are convinced that their
proposal will have such broad appeal to the middle class that their
Democratic rivals will find it politically difficult to resist.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is most troubling to the middle class?'' Joseph L. Bruno,
the leader of the Republican majority in the Senate, asked in an
interview on Tuesday. ``It's educating their children and getting
them a college education. This would help middle-income families
struggling with the costs of college.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal to provide tax deductions to offset the cost of
college comes just two months after the state initiated another
program intended to make college more affordable. Under that
program, individuals can deduct thousands of dollars from their
state taxable income by putting the money in a special savings
account to pay for college.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Lynch, a spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Sheldon
Silver, said on Tuesday that Democrats were considering their own
tax cuts, aimed primarily at spurring job growth. But she added
that the Assembly leadership would be open to considering the
college plan. ``Obviously, it's something that we would be
interested in,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The college plan is the centerpiece of a broad package of tax
cuts that Senate Republicans say they intend to push during the
1999 legislative session, which begins next month. Bruno's aides
said that he intended to release details of the Republicans'
package at a news conference on Wednesday in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Five other states _ New Jersey, Massachusetts, Louisiana,
Michigan, and Arkansas _ already allow taxpayers to deduct a
portion of their annual college tuition costs. But the proposal in
New York differs from the other plans in that it would allow people
to deduct the total cost of their annual college tuition.

FRIENDLY REPAST WITH AN ANGRY TIMES SQUARE PREACHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stacy Williams stood on his soapbox in Times Square
on Monday evening and let the world know he was back. ``You white
people are the nastiest, lowdown, wicked creatures ever to walk the
earth,'' he bellowed, his arms thrashing the air. His roar cut
through police sirens, car horns and even the thick shell of
cynicism coating the few New Yorkers in the throng.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a little extra fire in Williams' belly, it was
because his religious group, the Black Israelites, had reached an
interim settlement with the city last week that allowed them to
remain at their high-profile perch, where they have been loudly
prophesying a divine war of the races for years. The lawsuit, filed
with the help of the New York Civil Liberties Union, contends that
the administration of Mayor Rudoplh Giuliani has been trying to
stifle the Israelites by confiscating their literature, revoking
their amplified-sound permit and randomly arresting its members on
trumped-up charges.
</P>
<P>
   For Williams, the lead negotiator with the city and a Black
Israelite priest, the crackdown only reaffirmed his belief that his
brethren are persecuted apostles. ``We're being treated no
differently than the early Christians, except we're not being
killed,'' said Williams, whose 25-year-old congregation, based in
Harlem, believes that whites are devils and blacks are the true
descendants of the lost tribes of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   His sidewalk preaching over for the evening, Williams was
hungry. He chose the Blue Water Grill, a trendy seafood place on
Union Square where the only nonwhites were busing tables or playing
the jazz that filled the dining room. As he waded through the
crowd, he was greeted warmly by the captain and the hostess, both
of whom he knew from previous visits. ``Most people have no idea
what I do,'' said Williams, 39, whose formidable girth seems better
suited for football than for preaching.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to his angry Times Square persona, he was jovial and
open to skeptical prodding. ``I'm not militant,'' he said. ``I just
look that way.'' He ordered a plate of sushi, a bottle of white
Zinfandel and talked about what he said was an uneventful childhood
in upstate New York. He was born in the Bronx but his mother,
felled by a nervous breakdown, sent him and his brother to a group
home in Millbrook. Williams says he came to appreciate the country
air, solid schools and racially mixed populace. ``I became a master
chess player at 7,'' he said. Many of his friends, he points out,
were white.
</P>
<P>
   But the city drew him back at 16, which was when Williams'
formal education came to an end. He worked as a contractor, a
stand-up comedian and a bouncer at Studio 54. He joined an
interracial church and explored the Nation of Islam. ``My spirit
was wandering,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 1991 riots in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, where Williams
lived at the time, that helped deliver his spirit to the Black
Israelites. Williams says the death of 7-year-old Gavin Cato,
crushed by a car carrying the Lubavitch Grand Rabbi, convinced him
that racial injustice in America reflected an evil of, quite
literally, biblical proportions. ``When nobody was punished for
this crime, it all came together for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Walking through Times Square that summer, Williams stopped to
listen as the robed and turban-wearing Israelites talked about
judgment day, when blacks would rule the world. ``What they said
landed in the middle of my lap, my soul, my consciousness,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   When he isn't preaching or spending time with his 2-year-old
daughter, Williams, who lives in Harlem, works as a bodyguard and
chauffeur for brand-name athletes and Hollywood celebrities. But
since his name began appearing in newspapers, he said, business has
dried up. ``It doesn't matter,'' he said, ``because God comes
first.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israelites keep kosher, study ancient Hebrew and avoid
modern forms of entertainment. (As a group, they did see
``Independence Day'' because of what Williams said were the film's
``biblical implications.'') Israelite children attend the group's
yeshiva, and women are not allowed to preach or teach.
</P>
<P>
   Williams disagrees with the widespread view that the Israelites
are hate-mongering racists, and compares their invective to that of
a prosecutor presenting evidence against an accused rapist. ``It's
not like we're making this stuff up,'' he said, reeling off
biblical passages to back up his belief that whites have done
nothing but oppress, enslave and kill minorities. ``We are the
prosecutors of white America.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, who is representing the group in federal court,
says he does not agree with the Israelites' message, but that that
is beside the point. ``This is exactly the kind of speech the First
Amendment was designed to protect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, noting that no black lawyers would touch the case,
said he appreciated the help. Does that mean not all white people
are devils? ``Some whites can be nice,'' he said, ``but if you
spend enough time with them, they'll stab you in the back.'' Either
way, he said, even well-intentioned whites will become slaves after
Armageddon, which the Israelites expect with the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   As dessert and coffee were served, Williams' dinner companion
protested that his relatives were recent immigrants, not
slaveholders. ``Sorry about that,'' he said, smiling weakly. ``But
your forefathers screwed it up for you.''

CULTURE NOTES: `NOTCRACKER' SEASON; KUROSAWA'S LAST SCRIPT;
CELEBRATION OF STRINGS; CONDUCTOR TAKES GERMAN POST
</HEADLINE>
   (mk)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ For dance devotees who have had enough of ``The
Nutcracker,'' Wednesday brings the start of the ``Notcracker''
season at the Joyce Theater. Through Jan. 3, Eliot Feld's Ballet
Tech will present 10 performances of its family program and four of
its repertory program. The former includes not only last season's
hit ``Simon Sez,'' with a cast of seven children, 12 professional
dancers and nearly a dozen equally special Joyce stagehands, but
also a revival of ``Papillon,'' set to Offenbach and featuring a
cast of 41, including a caterpillar turned butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   Final Bow
</P>
<P>
   Akira Kurosawa's final script will come to the screen next year,
according to plans announced Tuesday in Tokyo by his children and
staff. They said ``Ame Agaru'' (``Rain Stops''), to be made with
French financial assistance, would go before the cameras in April
for a hoped-for premiere at the Venice Film Festival in September,
one year after the acclaimed director's death at 88.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a novel by Shugoro Yamanoto and bearing parallels to
Japan's current economic problems, ``Rain Stops'' is a love story
about a penniless samurai and his wife in the Kyoho era
(1716-1735), when Japan paid for the excesses of the period that
preceded it. The production will be supervised by Takahashi
Koizumi, an assistant to Kurosawa for nearly 30 years, and will
draw on the talents of others long associated with the filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Festive Occasion
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Past, present and future will color the music when
Jaime Laredo leads the New York String Orchestra in two
performances celebrating the ensemble's 30th anniversary of holiday
concerts at Carnegie Hall. The concerts, at 7 p.m. Thursday and 8
p.m. Monday, are dedicated to Alexander Schneider, who, for 24
years before his death at 84 in 1993, was artistic director of the
New York String Orchestra project.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday the pianist Peter Serkin, who made his debut at age
12 in 1959 with Schneider conducting, will be the guest soloist.
Monday's event will include orchestra alumni who have become the
concertmasters of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Baltimore Symphony,
Boston Symphony and Cleveland Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Careers
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old New York-born conductor John Fiore has been
named chief conductor of the German cities of Duesseldorf and
Duisburg beginning with the 1999-2000 season. In joining their
Deutsche Oper Am Rhein, he will replace Zoltan Pesko, who is
leaving at the end of this season. The opera company was formed
after World War II to produce opera and ballet in the state of
North Rhine-Westphalia, Duesseldorf and Duisburg. In coming months,
Fiore is scheduled to lead performances with Opera Australia and
the NHK Symphony in Japan.

  (rl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   J. Harold Flannery Jr., an associate justice of the
Massachusetts Appeals Court since 1995 who was a civil rights
lawyer in the South and in Boston in the 1960s and 1970s, died on
Friday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He was 65 and
lived in Weston, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from cancer, said Rudolph Kass, also
an associate justice of the court.
</P>
<P>
   Flannery was a trial lawyer in the civil rights division of the
Justice Department from 1958 to 1970. He was deputy and acting
director of the Center for Law and Education at Harvard University
from 1970 to 1974, national director of the Lawyers' Committee for
Civil Rights Under Law from 1974 to 1975 and a Massachusetts
Superior Court judge from 1984 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Flannery was the lead counsel and strategist for
the plaintiffs in Morgan vs. Hennigan, the Boston school
desegregation case. A federal judge, W. Arthur Garrity Jr., ruled
in 1974 that the Boston School Committee had long breached the 14th
Amendment by sending white and black pupils to separate schools and
withholding from blacks equal protection under the law. Court
orders were implemented requiring that the Boston school system be
desegregated by busing.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier years, Flannery played a role in more than 40 civil
rights cases and in other civil-rights matters in the South. In
1966, he went to Oxford, Miss., to take part in litigation by the
federal government to require the authorities in Grenada, Miss., to
protect journalists and black schoolchildren who had been attacked
by mobs near that city's newly segregated schools.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, he rushed to Danville, Va., to confer with FBI agents
at a time when city officials were considering a strict curfew to
deal with that area's first determined effort by blacks to obtain
equal rights by demonstration. The effort had led to violence and
charges of police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   While he was on the bench, Flannery was perhaps best known for a
1993 case involving the right of homosexuals to march in South
Boston's St. Patrick's Day parade. He declared, ``History does not
record that St. Patrick limited his ministry to heterosexuals or
that General Washington's soldiers were all straight. Inclusiveness
should be the hallmark of the parade.''
</P>
<P>
   He held that it should be open to all participants who were
peaceful. His decision was upheld in 1994, but was reversed in 1995
by the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Flannery was born in West Pittston, Pa., and received a
bachelor's degree in 1955 from Wilkes College in Wilkes-Barre, Pa.,
and his law degree in 1958 from the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the former Barbara Marie Nash, whom
he married in 1967.

The Spirit of Keeping?  
 (fb) 
 By JAMES BARRON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Maybe some celebrities are not feeling generous this
year. Maybe their handlers _ the people they pay to read their
mail, screen their calls, arrange their appointments and keep their
limos idling at the curb _ took a preholiday holiday. Or maybe they
have only one coat.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 10, a representative of the Janovic Plaza paint stores
sent letters to half a dozen celebrities, including David Wells,
Bill Cosby, Barbra Streisand and Sandra Bullock. The letters asked
them to donate a coat to the New York Cares drive.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only Cindy Crawford has responded. The coat she donated
was a Calvin Klein leather pea jacket from Bergdorf Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just thought this was the best and most direct cause we
could come up with,'' said Adam Janovic, a vice president of the
family-owned chain. ``We called New York Cares and said we'd like
to help out; we can use our stores as locations for people to drop
off coats. I took one of my wife's coats and hung it on a rack.
That's how we started.''
</P>
<P>
   A pause. ``This is how she'll find out her coat is missing.''
</P>
<P>
   But back to the big-name types he has not heard from.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little disappointing,'' he said. ``I'm sure all of
these celebrities get lots of requests.''
</P>
<P>
   Winging It
</P>
<P>
   ``He sure has a big head,'' the actor Michael McGrath declared
when the wig and the top hat fell off. The audience at the
Roundabout Theater on Monday night roared.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath was talking about Martin Short, the actor the audience
had expected to see in ``Little Me.'' But Short was sidelined with
a cold. McGrath, who usually plays four roles, found himself
playing Short's eight.
</P>
<P>
   Short had not missed a performance since opening night last
month, which meant that McGrath had had only 20 hours of rehearsal.
``That didn't leave a lot of time to hone down what Marty does,''
he said, ``so a lot of what people saw really was winging it. I
called Marty at intermission and said, `Why don't you come over?
We're doing ``Hellzapoppin'' here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gershwin Duets
</P>
<P>
   Anne Wiggins Brown remembers what happened after her audition
for George Gershwin in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would call my house and say, `I just finished such-and-such
a part; come down and sing it,''' Brown, who created the role of
Bess in ``Porgy and Bess,'' said during a preconcert discussion at
Avery Fisher Hall on Saturday, the final night of the New York
Philharmonic's centenary tribute to Gershwin. ``And I would go to
his apartment and sing everything: soprano parts, mezzo-soprano,
tenor, baritone _ even duets and trios, with Gershwin singing with
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said she pleaded with Gershwin until he gave Bess a
reprise of the song ``Summertime,'' which is sung by another
character in the first act.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who was a 22-year-old Juilliard student when she got the
part, received enthusiastic applause on Saturday when she described
the original production's trip to strictly segregated Washington.
When she realized that her relatives and friends could not attend a
performance at the National Theater, she refused to perform. Todd
Duncan, too, eventually said he would not sing under those
conditions. Finally, the theater relented and allowed blacks in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a short-lived triumph, though,'' said Miss Brown, who
later married a Norwegian and has lived in Oslo since 1948. ``It
was for one week only, and it took 20 years for the National
Theater to change the rule permanently.''

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
AS it turns out, there really wasn't a Roger Clemens Bazaar at all.
</P>
<P>
   Never was it a baseball free-for-all _ and use the word ``free''
loosely _ for the greatest pitcher in the game, with so many
Yankees, Indians and Rangers making promises that maybe only their
checkbooks could back up. Instead, it was only the Astros. And only
the bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   It was petty, raw emotions _ resentment, greed, spite _ taking
over a delicate deal that could have been done and would have been
done but was seemingly ruined.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the Astros coming together to find a way to dance
among the baseball giants, squeezing salary numbers and players
into a deal that could have brought Clemens home to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a happy ending, like so many other stories that have
involved the heretofore highly respected names of Randy and Alan
Hendricks, Clemens, Gerry Hunsicker and Tal Smith. It was a story
that would be comical, if it weren't so sad for those men who did
everything but communicate fully with the owner, Drayton McLane Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker has earned his status as a top GM in the league. Smith
has been in the game for decades. The Hendrickses are that rarity
in sports agency _ respected. And never have I known Clemens to
lie.
</P>
<P>
   But they all erred this time. They ignored the owner, who was at
the heart of the negotiation from the start. They blew open a
severe wound that's still bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a matter of everyone doing all they could to find a
way to bring the last ingredient to a potential Astros title to
town. Instead, it was everyone doing all they could to have the
deal spiral out of control. It was the last straw, or so Clemens,
Randy and Alan Hendricks told us Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But remember this: McLane didn't totally concede defeat Tuesday,
and when pressed on whether the Astros were done, Randy Hendricks
said, ``I'll always talk with Drayton.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros apparently were the only team for whom Clemens wanted
to pitch if the price was right. Two weeks ago, McLane and the
Hendrickses apparently were within hours of swinging the trade for
the Cy Young king, a deal that involved Scott Elarton, Derek Bell
and a minor-leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   But somewhere between Houston and the baseball winter meetings
in Nashville, communication broke down and an explosion occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we were on a plane going to Nashville,'' Randy Hendricks
said, ``they started firing missiles at us.''
</P>
<P>
   By any gauge, those were not smart bombs Hunsicker tossed with
his Dec. 13 news conference in which he lambasted Clemens' contract
demands.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker apparently had not spoken to McLane before his news
conference. Hunsicker did not know what Hendricks told us Tuesday,
that the negotiation was settling into a comfort zone for both
sides. The Astros tried to salve the wounds after the news
conference, but the damage was done.
</P>
<P>
   It cut a deep wound into the heart of the Astros organization.
It showed disorganization. It tarnished the image of Clemens,
hanged Hunsicker out on a brittle limb and made Clemens' agents
look like money-grubbers.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, there was Tuesday's news conference called at the
Hendrickses' offices. It was a meeting meant to stop the bleeding
and seemingly scratch the Astros from Clemens' wish list. It was
pointed and defensive. It was enlightening, especially if you
believed the Hendrickses' contention that the contract extension
negotiated with McLane was millions of dollars cheaper than those
already offered by other teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I really wasn't going to go to those (other) cities,''
Clemens said. ``I could have, but I had other priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker said those priorities simply were like any other
money-grubber's priorities. Greedy ones.
</P>
<P>
   The Hendricks brothers countered that Hunsicker wasn't
intimately involved and they only were living up to the contract
agreement they made with Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Believe whichever side you choose. Believe neither. Or believe
the message in Tuesday's news conference, that the one team Clemens
really wanted to play for all along _ the Astros _ is the one team
he will not join at any price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this was something I could be excited about,''
Clemens said. ``But I have no interest working with, alongside,
those two individuals. None whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   But you should remember this: It's not done, because McLane is
not done.
</P>
<P>
   The wounds are bleeding. It hurts on both sides. It's
embarrassing. It might take a miracle to mend the wounds.
</P>
<P>
   But the one person who can tie a tourniquet on it all and maybe
put a bow around the Astros' deal of the century is the man who was
there at the start, refused to concede on Tuesday and refuses to go
away. McLane.

ATLANTA FAVORS ARE REVEALED AS PANEL BEGINS INQUIRY
</HEADLINE>

 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Olympic Committee, seeking to reassure nervous
corporate sponsors Tuesday that irregularities would be cleaned up
in the bidding process for the Winter and Summer Games, named
former Sen. George Mitchell on Tuesday to head its investigation
into allegations of vote-buying in Salt Lake City for the 2002
Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Also, an Atlanta Olympic official said that free medical
treatment had been provided to a member of the International
Olympic Committee from Africa, who has now been linked to services
provided by four Olympic bid cities.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, the former Democratic majority leader in the Senate
who brokered peace talks in Northern Ireland, is chairman of the
USOC's ethics committee.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was shocked that obtaining an Olympics appears
to require providing extravagant gifts and favors, Mitchell said,
``I spent 30 years in politics, and the last three years in
Northern Ireland; not much shocks me anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said that his five-member panel would investigate the
Salt Lake bidding process with no preconceived notions and would
seek to make sure that the bidding process for American cities was
``fair and above reproach.''
</P>
<P>
   He plans to issue his report by the end of February, and told
reporters on a conference call that the investigation would not
interfere with his possible mediation in President Clinton's
attempt to prevent being removed from office by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate sponsors such as Coca-Cola and US West have expressed
concern about charges that Salt Lake City used vote-buying to
attract the 2002 Winter Games. USOC President Bill Hybl said
Tuesday that sponsors had been assured that apparent mistakes made
by Salt Lake City ``won't occur in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Battle, who was the head of international relations for
the Atlanta bid, said that David Sibandze, an IOC member from
Swaziland, had undergone hospital tests for chest pains during a
visit to Atlanta when it was bidding to become host of the 1996
Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   While on his visit, Sibandze brought a guest, whom Battle
described as a prince in the royal family of the kingdom of
Swaziland. During a trip to see the sailing competition site in
Savannah, Ga., Atlanta officials bought a tie and a sports coat for
Sibandze's guest to attend a dinner, Battle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can make a big deal out of stuff like that, but that's
just decency,'' Battle said.
</P>
<P>
   Of Sibandze, he said: ``It wasn't like he just came and wanted
to have his heart checked. You take care of them when they are
stricken.''
</P>
<P>
   Sibandze's son, Sibusiso Sibandze, also worked as an intern at
City Hall in Salt Lake in 1993 and 1994, while the city was bidding
for the 2002 Winter Games, the mayor's office announced last week.
He received bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of
Utah in the mid-1990s, but it is not known whether he was one of
six relatives of IOC members whom Salt Lake Olympic officials say
received scholarships and athletic training under a $400,000
program of humanitarian aid operated from 1991 until this year.
</P>
<P>
   Australian newspapers have reported that a daughter of
Sibandze's obtained a job at a catering institute in Sydney with
the help of the president of the Australian Olympic Committee
during the bid process for the 2000 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   Sibusiso Sibandze also received a three-month scholarship offer
to a Swedish university in 1985, while Falun, Sweden, was bidding
to become host of the 1992 Winter Olympics, which were eventually
awarded to Albertville, France. That story was first reported by
The Sunday Times of London.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, in an interview with The New York Times, a former
Swedish Olympic official, Wolf Lyberg, said that the scholarship
had been arranged by the head of the Swedish Olympic Committee, Bo
Engstrom, who died about 10 years ago. Sibandze did not attend the
Swedish university, Lyberg said, thus the matter was closed. But,
he said, Swedish Olympic officials warned Engstrom that ``he
shouldn't have done it.''
</P>
<P>
   A person who answered the phone at David Sibandze's home in
Swaziland said that he was away and would not return until
Wednesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Marc Hodler, a senior member of the IOC from Switzerland, has
said that Salt Lake City was a victim of agents who demand
exorbitant amounts of money to deliver blocs of votes of IOC
members. Hodler said that as many as 25 of the IOC's 114 members
may be vulnerable to selling votes for gifts and favors.
</P>
<P>
   Sibandze, 66, has been a member of the IOC since 1984. He is
from a tiny kingdom between South Africa and Mozambique, and is not
considered a major power broker within the Olympic movement. Battle
said he knew Sibandze to be a small businessman from an
underdeveloped nation who perhaps believed that, within established
procedures of the bidding process, he could find opportunities for
some of his eight children. Sibandze never asked for a scholarship
from Atlanta officials, Battle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hodler seems to act like there are really powerful, venal
operators out there who almost blackmail you into hiring them,''
Battle said. ``I don't think that's true at all. What I know is
that you are in the business of trying to curry favor with people,
and you can possibly go overboard in what you are willing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In that environment, Battle said, an IOC member like Sibandze
might have found a bid city willing to provide services for him
without a promise of his vote in return. ``If people were willing
to help his children in school, that was a great opportunity for
him,'' Battle said. ``But I'm not saying he ought to have done
that. Giving scholarships is wrong.''  &QL;

MARKET PLACE: SEC ACCUSES GRACE AND 6 FORMER EXECUTIVES OF FRAUD
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Fla., Mass.) (Eds: SUBS to clarify throughout that SEC has ACCUSED Grace of
fraud, sted CHARGED; note new overline.)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal securities regulators accused W.R. Grace &AMP; Co. and six
of its former executives of fraud on Tuesday, saying that the
company had deceived shareholders over five years by falsely
reporting earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The move was part of a larger plan by the Securities and
Exchange Commission to crack down on the growing number of
companies, including some of the nation's largest, that break
accounting rules so they can manipulate earnings and meet Wall
Street's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear from companies that say, `Everybody is doing it, so why
can't we,' '' said Richard H. Walker, the SEC's director of
enforcement. ``This is an area of great concern.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a civil complaint filed in U.S. District Court in
Miami, Grace, the large chemical company based in Boca Raton, Fla.,
was blessed with unexpected revenue in the early 1990s. But instead
of reporting all that revenue, the complaint said, executives moved
$10 million to $20 million to later years when business was not as
good.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators said that by using the false accounting, the company
was able to report that revenue was on the rise for its health care
group from 1991 to 1993, even though actual revenue was declining.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the amount of revenue involved, the SEC said in
the complaint, Grace management had misled investors just by not
disclosing that it ``was engaged in an ongoing scheme to
fraudulently manipulate its reported earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Grace said Tuesday that it would
``vigorously contest'' the accusations. The statement said the
company believed its accounting in past years was proper and that
the litigation should not have a significant impact on current
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The company said none of the executives involved in the
questioned accounting still worked for the company. And, it said
that its outside auditing firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, was aware
of the accounting and had not raised any objections.
</P>
<P>
   David Nestor, a spokesman for PriceWaterhousecoopers, said that
the accounting firm did not comment on client matters. ``But we
stand behind our work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's share price fell $1.5625, or 9.65 percent, to
$14.625, after the SEC's announcement on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators said Grace executives had declined to report $10
million to $20 million in revenue that the company had received in
the early 1990s from a change in the Medicare reimbursement rules
because the executives believed that it would not help the
company's stock price. At the time, the company was already
reporting revenue at a rate that Wall Street was expecting. So
instead, according to the complaint, the executives set aside the
unexpected Medicare revenue in another account and then gradually
used it to increase revenue from 1993 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you manipulate earnings to show what you want to show and
to not show the actual results,'' Walker said, ``shareholders are
deceived.''
</P>
<P>
   Regulators are continuing their investigation into Grace's
accounting, he said, and plan to file similar complaints against
other companies.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint filed on Tuesday in Miami seeks civil penalties
and asks for an injunction restraining the company and its
executives from further violations of federal securities laws.
</P>
<P>
   The revenue that the SEC is questioning was earned by a Grace
subsidiary, National Medical Care Inc. of Waltham, Mass. The
company sold National Medical Care, which operates kidney dialysis
clinics, to Fresenius AG of Germany in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators said Grace executives used the unexpected revenue
received by National Medical Care for ``profit planning purposes.''
The amounts, which were improperly deferred in the accounting books
by setting up reserve accounts, were used later to increase revenue
of the health care group to meet Wall Street's expectations and to
raise the company's earnings reported in its consolidated financial
statements.
</P>
<P>
   For example, for the fourth quarter of 1994, Grace senior
managers asked executives at National Medical Care to report an
additional $1.5 million in income, the regulators said, because
Grace needed that amount to increase its consolidated earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators also filed an administrative complaint against the
former Grace executives, including J.P. Bolduc, who had been chief
executive, contending that they helped issue the financial reports
that the regulators say are false.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Walpin, a lawyer for Bolduc, said that his client would
contest the accusations and ``expects to be vindicated.'' He said
the government's suit was ``an attempt to punish a chief executive
for performing his responsibilities exactly as a responsible CEO
should.'' &QL;

INJURED GYMNAST TO JOIN IN TIMES SQUARE CELEBRATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Chinese gymnast who was paralyzed by a spinal
injury in last summer's Goodwill Games will join in the ceremonial
lowering of the ball in Times Square on New Year's Eve, the
organizers of the holiday celebration announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Sexton, president of the Times Square Business
Improvement District, a business group that is helping to organize
the event, said the gymnast, Sang Lan, 17, was chosen because she
had become an international symbol of courage.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's shown not only what the human body can do in terms of
the strength she's exerted in rehabilitating herself,'' Sexton said
at a news conference, ``but most importantly, she's shown what
courage and happiness are all about, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sang was injured July 21 during a routine warmup vault at
the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y. She was paralyzed from the
chest down. Doctors do not expect her to regain the use of her
legs.
</P>
<P>
   But as she demonstrated Tuesday when two multicolored pompoms
were placed in her hands, she has been gaining strength. Since she
was released from the hospital on Oct. 30, she has been staying

therapy. She was in a wheelchair at the news conference, and she
said through her interpreter and guardian, Gina Liu, that she felt
fine.

<P>
   Her studies in English enabled her to handle some of the
speaking herself. ``Hi, everybody,'' she said, smiling broadly and
waving her arms at the audience at the Times Square Visitors Center
on Broadway near 47th Street. ``I love New York. I love you all.
Happy holidays.''

   The inviting of guests to participate in the ceremony started
two years ago. In 1996, Oseola McCarty, an 88-year-old laundress
who donated her life savings of $150,000 to the University of
Southern Mississippi, was invited to join in the ceremonial
pressing of the start button.

SPITZER APPOINTS VETERAN PROSECUTORS AS LAW DEPUTIES  (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 NYT   By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Eliot L. Spitzer, New York's attorney general-elect,
appointed several veteran prosecutors Tuesday to fill senior
positions in his inner circle when he takes office on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the selection of a senior staff arouses little
attention in governmental circles. But Spitzer, a Democrat, made it
a major topic in his campaign, suggesting that his Republican
predecessor, Dennis C. Vacco, had turned the office into a
patronage mill racked by cronyism.
</P>
<P>
   To fill the office of first deputy attorney general, Spitzer
named Michele Hirshman, currently an assistant U. S. attorney for
the Southern District in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hirshman, who has been responsible for cases involving
racketeering, narcotics and civil rights, has been involved in a
several prominent cases. Among those were the government's
prosecution of Ronald Reale, the former head of the Transit
Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, on charges of money laundering,
and Robert Garcia, the former representative who was convicted of
four counts of extortion in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Spitzer has appointed Pamela Jones Harbour, a
former assistant attorney general in the antitrust bureau under
Robert Abrams, to be the assistant first deputy attorney general.
She has concentrated primarily on antitrust and consumer affairs
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Rifkin, the executive director of the New York State
Ethics Commission, will be a deputy attorney general for state
counsel. His major responsibility will be to defend the state and
its agencies against lawsuits. Rifkin was counsel to Abrams and
Stanley Simon during their administrations as president of the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Dietrich L. Snell, an assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern
District's criminal division, will serve as deputy attorney general
for public advocacy. In his current position, Snell has
concentrated on terrorism, securities bank fraud and computer
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   James C. Moore, a lawyer with Harter, Secrest &AMP; Emery in
Rochester and president of the New York State Bar Association, said
that Spitzer's appointments indicated ``that he is focusing on
qualifications and accomplishments as the primary consideration.''
He added, ``We're delighted with the start that the attorney
general-elect is making.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's selection of his senior staff has come very close to
his inauguration as a result of the closeness of the contest and
the protracted challenges of the results by Vacco. Spitzer's
election as attorney general was certified last week. But that
followed seven weeks of legal wrangling in which Vacco made
unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud while seeking either to have
himself declared the winner or to have a new election ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer hailed his appointees as ``stupendous lawyers.'' He
added that ``the fact that their names are not recognized by
political mavens is a testament to the fact that we have searched
for lawyers rather than politically active individuals.''

INSURER NEGOTIATING SALE OF COMMERCIAL BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ace Ltd., a fast-growing Bermuda insurance company, is
negotiating to buy the large commercial insurance business of the
Cigna Corp., a leading health insurer, the companies said Tuesday.
In a joint statement, the companies said they expected the final
price to exceed $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction would transform Ace, a specialty insurer with $1
billion in revenue last year, into a leading commercial insurer in
the United States and abroad with revenue of more than $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The sale would free Cigna to further concentrate on health
insurance and other employee benefits, in a refocusing undertaken
by many insurers that once tried to offer coverage for almost
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes a lot of sense for both parties,'' said Weston
Hicks, an insurance analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   Cigna shares advanced $1.50, to $79.125, and Ace rose $1.375, to
$28.9475. Trading of both stocks had been halted at the opening
Tuesday before the companies confirmed a Reuters report on the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   In the joint statement, Brian Duperreault, chief executive of
Ace, described Cigna's commercial business as ``one of the premier
global property and casualty franchises.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts doubt whether Ace can make money from Cigna's
commercial business, where revenue has been declining for years. At
$3 billion, analysts said, Ace would be paying 1.5 times the book
value of the Cigna commercial business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think they would be paying book value at best,'' said
Ira Zuckerman, an analyst at Nutmeg Securities Ltd. in Westport,
Conn. ``If you could cut $100 million out of Cigna's expenses you
could make a deal like this profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Such expense cutting might be possible if another big insurer
were the buyer, Zuckerman said, but Ace's relatively small size
means there is little overlap between the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said they believed the negotiations between Ace
and Cigna had been either prompted or accelerated by the
announcement two weeks ago that Aetna Inc. was buying the health
care business of the Prudential Insurance Company of America for $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   By increasing their size, giant health insurers are able to
negotiate more favorable deals with doctors, hospitals and
insurance customers. To keep up, analysts said, Cigna appeared to
be under pressure to increase its own health care business by
buying up a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``My read is that Cigna could get money from the sale of its
commercial business and then buy another health care company,''
said Kenneth Zuckerberg, an analyst at Keefe Bruyette &AMP; Woods Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Cigna has said previously that it was intent upon expanding its
health care and other employee benefit businesses. But neither
Cigna nor Ace would discuss their strategies in connection with the
current negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said Cigna might also want to use the proceeds of
the sale to upgrade its computer systems to improve its
competitiveness in managing health care costs.
</P>
<P>
   While Cigna has not been as profitable as some competitors in
commercial insurance, it has been in the black in the last few
years since the resolution of expensive asbestos-related claims,
which hurt many insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Ace's growth since its founding 14 years ago has come
through acquisitions. But nothing it has bought in the past comes
close to the deal it is now contemplating. Its two largest
acquisitions, Tempest Re in 1996 and Cat Ltd. last April, were for
about $700 million each.

WHY CAN'T WE START PLAYING BASEBALL?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Winter just began for weathermen, but it's half
over for baseball fans. That won't warm your hands and feet, but it
ought to warm your soul.
</P>
<P>
   It's been 63 days since the Yankees' Scott Brosius threw out the
last Padre in the World Series. It'll be another 62 days until the
first bunt drills of spring training.
</P>
<P>
   And the only question is: Do we have to wait that long?
</P>
<P>
   Except for the Roger Clemens trade, still unmade, the major
player moves have been completed, the new managers hired. All of
the owners' money has been spent. Hasn't it?
</P>
<P>
   The sports market is wide open, what with basketball locked out,
and the country, which enjoyed the uplift last summer, needs a new
distraction these days.
</P>
<P>
   So open the training camps, warm up the hotdogs, tell the
amazing Joe DiMaggio to loosen up his first-pitching arm, rake the
infield, instruct Candace Brown to stow her carry-on items in the
overhead compartment, and let's get the season going on New Year's
Day.
</P>
<P>
   In a 262-game season, somebody might hit 100 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Now we'll do our part by forecasting the pennant races, based on
the newly shaken up rosters, as if the season starts next week.
Which, if we have our way, it does.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; National League West: &LR;  1. Dodgers; 2. Arizona; 3. San
Francisco; 4. San Diego; 5. Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The NL champion Padres' dismemberment is the story here, more
than the Dodgers' wheeling and dealing. San Diego loses Kevin
Brown's and Joey Hamilton's combined 31 victories, loses center
fielder Steve Finley and loses third baseman Ken Caminiti, while
adding only 10-game winner Woody Williams from Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have a new ace in Brown _ their last ace was Orel
Hershiser _ a new catcher in Todd Hundley and a new center fielder
in Devon White. New manager Davey Johnson will be more important
than any of them.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks have the most improved pitching staff in the
league with the signings of Randy Johnson and Todd Stottlemyre (who
combined for 33 wins last year) and relievers Armando Reynoso and
Greg Swindell. If Finley remembers how to hit left-handers, he'll
more than replace White.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are wild-card contenders again after making few
changes. Colorado was clever to sign left-hander Brian Bohanon away
from the Dodgers, who couldn't score runs for him.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NL Central: &LR;  1. Houston; 2. Chicago; 3. Cincinnati; 4. St.
Louis; 5. Milwaukee; 6. Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds move up after adding Denny Neagle and Steve Avery to
the starting rotation even though they lose second baseman Bret
Boone.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs re-signed their important free agents, except for
starter Mark Clark, who they replaced with Jon Leiber in a trade
with the Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' division title should be safe even after they lost
Randy Jonnson while replacing Sean Berry at third with Caminiti.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NL East: &LR;  1. Atlanta; 2. New York; 3. Philadelphia; 4.
Montreal; 5. Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are a lot better, adding 20-homer third baseman Robin
Ventura, major-league steals leader Rickey Henderson, 22-saves
reliever Armando Benitez (oh, and Dodgers Bobby Bonilla and Roger
Cedeno).
</P>
<P>
   It's not enough to catch the Braves, who get stronger in right
field with Brian Jordan's .316-25-91, stronger at second with Bret
Boone's 95 RBI and stronger on the bench with Otis Nixon's .297.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; American League West: &LR;  1. Angels; 2. Texas; 3. Seattle; 4.
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Texas is a little better; arriving first
baseman Rafael Palmeiro and starter Mark Clark get the edge over
departing first baseman Will Clark and late-season starter
Stottlemyre.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are a lot better with Mo Vaughn (.337, 40 homers, 115
RBI) coming to first base, if the club takes advantage of the
chance to get something by trading Jim Edmonds, to be displaced in
center field by '98 first baseman Darin Erstad.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AL Central: &LR;  1. Cleveland; 2. Detroit; 3. Chicago; 4. Kansas
City; 5. Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians deepen their bullpen with Jerry Spradlin and Ricardo
Rincon, and reunite second baseman Robbie Alomar with brother Sandy
Jr. All of which means the best hope for the rest of the division
is realignment.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AL East: &LR;  1. New York; 2. Baltimore; 3. Boston; 4. Toronto; 5.
Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees performed no mean feat by re-signing key free agents
Brosius, Bernie Williams and David Cone, just what few World Series
winners have been able to do lately.
</P>
<P>
   That's too bad for the Orioles, who've had the most active
winter in baseball at both the arrival and departure gates,
welcoming AL slugging leader Albert Belle, catcher Charles Johnson,
second baseman Delino DeShields and relievers Mike Timlin and
Xavier Hernandez as well as Will Clark, saying goodbye to
outfielder Eric Davis, second baseman Robbie Alomar, relievers
Armando Benitez and Alan Mills as well as Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   But enough winter. Play ball, already.

SUHARTO SON-IN-LAW REJECTS JORDANIAN CITIZENSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to reflect Subianto's rejection of Jordan's citizenship
offer.)  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ A son-in-law of former President Suharto
has been offered citizenship in Jordan, the official Antara press
agency has reported.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, the son-in-law, Prabowo Subianto, said he had
turned down the offer. He issued a statement saying, ``I was indeed
offered Jordanian citizenship, but I answered that though I was
deeply grateful, I had to refuse the offer as Indonesia does not
allow dual citizenship.'' The statement was carried by papers here.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven soldiers once commanded by Prabowo went on trial
Wednesday morning on charges of abducting and torturing political
dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   Prabowo, a former lieutenant general and commander of the
Kopassus commando force, was honorably discharged on Dec. 10, after
accepting responsibility for the kidnapping and torture of
Suharto's political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   He has been living in Amman, Jordan, for four months, said his
brother Hashim Djojohadikusumo, who added that Prabowo had malaria
and liver and kidney disease.
</P>
<P>
   The trial of the commandos, in connection with the abduction and
torture of 24 people this year, will be in a military court. One
victim was found dead and 13 are missing.
</P>
<P>
   Prabowo and two other senior officers may face a court-martial
if evidence links them to human rights abuses, the military says.
Prabowo has said he is willing to return to testify, his brother
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, State Secretary Akbar Tangjung said the government
was about to wrap up its investigation. ``The process will be aimed
at ascertaining the extent of retired Lt. Gen. Prabowo's
involvement in the case,'' Tangjung said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, President B.J. Habibie pledged that the government
would continue to investigate the role of the military in rioting,
arson and looting in May that left 1,200 people dead and ended the
32-year autocratic reign of Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Tangjung also said the government would ``soon finalize the
judicial process'' in the case of a fatal shooting by the military
of six students in the days before the riots.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, in the face of widespread opposition, the
government decided to postpone establishment of a 40,000-member
civilian militia. The idea for the militia was put forward by the
armed forces chief, Gen. Wiranto, as way to improve law and order,
especially before the elections scheduled for June 7.
