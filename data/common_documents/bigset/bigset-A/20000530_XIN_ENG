<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Agrees to Settle Conflict with Eritrea Peacefully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AGIERS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyom
Mesfin said upon his arrival here on Monday that his country is
looking forward to peaceful settlement of its ongoing conflict with
Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
"We came here because we hope for peaceful settlement of the
conflict with Eritrea," Seyom was quoted by the Algerian News
Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Addis Ababa wants to restore peace in line with the
international laws. It will not disappoint people of both Ethiopia
and Eritrea," he added.
</P>
<P>
Seyom praised the effective and continuous efforts made by
Algerian President Abdul-Aziz Bouteflika who is also current
chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika visited Asmara, capital of Eritrea, and Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia, recently and showed personal interest in restoring peace
between the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The visit resulted in the return of the two warring sides to the
negotiating table, Seyom pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Violence leads to no solution of problems," he said, adding
that "the ongoing border dispute drained 90 percent of the
Ethiopian and Eritrean resources."
</P>
<P>
The first round of talks between the two countries, held early
May in Algiers, failed to reach any positive result, leading to the
eruption of the fighting anew.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika's shuttle diplomacy between Asmara and Addis Ababa
between May 24 and 26 and his talks with Eritrean President Issayas
Aferwerki and Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi yielded the
agreement of both sides to resume the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday Eritrean Foreign Minister Haile Woldetensae arrived
here to attend the peace talks with his Ethiopian counterpart
starting from Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> US Urges Negotiated Solution to S. Lankan Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Under Secretary of State for
Political Affairs Thomas Pickering Monday reiterated his country's
position that Sri Lankan ethnic conflicts must be resolved through
a negotiated political solution.
</P>
<P>
Pickering, who is on a one-day visit to the island country,
called on Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga, Foreign
Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar and leader of the opposition Ranil
Wickremesinghe.
</P>
<P>
The call on Foreign Minister Kadirgamar was followed by
official talks between the two sides, said a statement from the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
"He conveyed the firm opposition of the United States to the
carving out of a separate state," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It said Pickering was briefed by the Sri Lankan leaders on the
current situation in the northern Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has long been plagued by ethnic conflicts between the
majority Sinhalese-dominated government and Tamil Tiger rebels who
have been fighting for a separate state in the country's north and
east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) launched a fierce attack on government troops in a bid to
recapture their former stronghold of the Jaffna peninsula which
they lost in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The relevance of the facilitation process undertaken by Norway,
with the aim of bringing the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE
together for negotiations in this regard, was emphasized," said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
It said Pickering had appreciated the detailed exposition he
received of Sri Lanka's efforts to resolve the ethnic question
within the country's democratic framework.
</P>
<P>
Pickering arrived here early Monday morning after his visits to
India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
In New Delhi he held discussions with the Indian government on
the situation in Sri Lanka. He was also joined at those
discussions by Norway's Foreign State Secretary Raymond Johansen
who was in Colombo last week continuing his country's mediatory
role.
</P>
<P>
His visit is seen by diplomatic circles as a strong gesture of
U.S. support to Colombo in the context of the intensified war
situation here.

<HEADLINE> Worst Is Over for E.coli Crisis in Canadian Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The worst E. coli outbreak in
Canada's history is down from its peak with new cases reported on
decline, according to the hospital of Walkerton, where the week-
long plague has caused the deaths of five residents and is
expected to claim its sixth.
</P>
<P>
The emergency transfer to nearby London Health Sciences Center
indicates that the massive E. coli infection is not finished but "
the worst is over," said Dianne Waram, chief executive of
Walkerton hospital, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The hospital is seeing about 30 new cases each day and that
number will drop as time passes, she said.
</P>
<P>
A daily 50 or more cases were reported at the hospital during
the worst days last week, when the number of patients rocketed
from 160 to more than 1,000 in the town's community of 4,800.
</P>
<P>
Despite the easing of the outbreak, at least one more life may
be lost before this crisis is over.
</P>
<P>
The family of an elderly patient in critical condition at
Walkerton's hospital have indicated they want palliative care,
meaning the patient will not receive any invasive treatment.
</P>
<P>
The town's water supply is reported to be contaminated after a
rainstorm flooded the area. Local residents are being advised to
boil water to drink while lots of families continue to drive out
of town for their showers in fear of infection.

<P>
CANBERRA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer urged here Tuesday the Fiji military to restore
the democratic government as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He told the Nine Network of Australian Television that "We want
the military as soon as possible -- and I don't mean by that
months later but as soon as possible -- to restore civilian and
democratic government and we hope very much that this is going to
be a step towards that final outcome."
</P>
<P>
Fijian Army Chief Commander Frank Bainimarama last night
declared martial law and took over the rein of the troubled island
nation.
</P>
<P>
Downer said he was unaware whether any deal has been done
between the Fiji military and coup leader George Speight but
discussions were inevitable.
</P>
<P>
He said Australia would not accept Speight receiving a pardon
and taking a role in a future Fiji government. "We won't regard
Speight, who's a terrorist, participation in any government in
Fiji as acceptable at all," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, before the military takeover, the foreign
minister had listed a series of possible sanctions against Fiji if
the democratic government in the country is not restored.

<HEADLINE> Russian Official Cautious on Chechen Talks Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Kremlin spokesman on Chechnya
said Thursday that a reported offer by Chechen leaders abandon
separatism for peace was "of some interest, though it must be
treated extremely carefully."
</P>
<P>
Sergei Yastrzhembsky was commenting on an interview with former
Ichkerian (Chechen) vice president Vakha Arsanov published Tuesday
on a local newspaper, Moscow News.
</P>
<P>
Arsanov claimed that forces controlled by Chechen leader Aslan
Maskhadov are ready for peace talks and concessions with the
federal government. They may even choose not to raise the question
of the status of Chechnya at the talks at all, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We can make very significant concessions, probably even
greater than the Russian side expects, in order to restore peace,"
Arsanov said.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky, the Kremlin spokesman, said that "the evolution
in the mentality of the rebels and their leaders is of interest."
</P>
<P>
"Maskhadov's and Arsanov's readiness to resign after the
hostilities are brought to an end has been expressed for the first
time. If this is a serious intention and not a bluff this is a
step in a right direction, since there is no room for Maskhadov in
the future set-up of Chechnya," the Interfax news agency quoted
the spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky said he also regards as "not without interest
that Arsanov declares a readiness to make concessions on the issue
of Chechnya's status."
</P>
<P>
However, he registered doubts over the reported offer's
authenticity and the coordination of the stands of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
"Maskhadov and others have too often quickly denied their
statements, saying they were incorrectly understood," he said.

<HEADLINE> Conflict in Yugoslavia Has Considerable Impact on Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The concentration of heavy metals
in the Danube waters, when the river enters Romania was 2-20 times
higher during the conflict in Yugoslavia, compared with the values
registered before the conflict, the official Rompres news agency
reported on Tuesday quoting a report for the year 1999 of Romania'
s Environment Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The metals present in this period in the Danube waters add to
the amount existing before the conflict and it is a long-term "
imprint", the rise in the concentration being able to be felt in
the fish meat, where it was 2-7 times bigger than in the previous
period. Compared with the highest values admitted by the
regulations of the Health Ministry, 1.2 times more copper, 2 times
more lead and 7 times more cadmium were found in the test.
</P>
<P>
The contamination of the waters led to including the Danube for
the year 1999 in 4 quality class, lower than the 2-3 class for the
1994-1996 period. The tests of sediments carried out by
specialists from the ministry above indicated 75-170 times more
persisting organic pollutants than in the previous years.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry's specialists believe that the results of the
tests indicate the existence of the pollution of the water, in
consequence of the conflict in Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Drought Damages Harvests in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The weather over the last 10-12
weeks has been characterized by low precipitation and high
temperatures all over Romania, and the ground water supply is
unsatisfactory in almost all the agricultural regions of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Under these circumstances, the wheat crop seems to have a low
production potential. Thus, the data delivered by the Institute of
research for Cereals and Plant Technology in Fundulea reveal that
the forecast wheat production does not exceed 2,000 kilograms per
hectare, it is almost sure that the harvest from the 1.8 million
hectares cultivated will be at the minimum necessary to meet the
population's demand, at the most.
</P>
<P>
Corn is being damaged by the lack of water, too. This extremely
serious situation requires immediate irrigation, the specialists
recommend. Moreover, the irrigation should have been done in April,
in order to prevent the effects of the drought.
</P>
<P>
In Romania, irrigation devices cover 3.1 million hectares, but
functional for about 1.8 million hectares. So far, contracts for
irrigating only 266,234 hectares have been concluded and
irrigation were made on 8,354 hectares, which is totally
insignificant.
</P>
<P>
One of the main causes is the lack of money, agriculture being
unable to pay the high costs for irrigation. At the end of last
week, the National Company for Land Improvements communicated the
reduction of tax for irrigation, as agriculture refused to
conclude contracts. Taxes were diminished from 462,970 lei(22 U.S.
dollars)per 1,000 cubic meters to 254,161 lei(12 U.S. dollars) per
1,000 cubic meters for pumping the water directly from the outlet
and from 704,605 lei(34 U.S. dollars) to 578,378 lei(28 U.S.
dollars) for pumping the water a longer distance. Also, if
contracts are guaranteed with real estate, the services provided
may be paid with agricultural products, after gathering the
harvests.

<P>
BOGOTA, May 30 (Xinhua)-- Colombian government and rebel
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) decided to return to
the dialog table after an eleven-day interruption of talks.
</P>
<P>
Parties, in statements disclosed Tuesday by the press,
expressed disposition to analysis of the international agenda of
peace process and of matters so crucial as a ceasefire and "
exchange of prisoners".
</P>
<P>
But FARC let know they'll take to this meeting a new proposal
so that parties reopen talks concerning the hostages' crisis,
which have been paralyzed for a year.
</P>
<P>
The oldest and most numerous guerrilla force in the country
ratified at Tuesday's encounter that a decision is preferable
about carrying out the two-day international public hearing on
environment and illegal planting.
</P>
<P>
The international meeting programmed initially for Monday was
suspended May 16 by President Andres Pastrana a day after a
peasant woman was murdered with a "necklace-bomb" in Boyaca in an
event where an explosives expert died .
</P>
<P>
Military and police heads attributed the attempt to FARC, which
immediately rejected imputing and condemned the crime. According
to preliminary investigations of the Attorney-General's office ,
it could have been committed by common delinquent gangs.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says U.S.-DPRK Rome Talks Make Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Tuesday that the Rome talks between Washington and Pyongyang were
serious and constructive and made progress.
</P>
<P>
The six-day long talks, which ended on Tuesday, were "serious
and constructive," State Department spokesman Philip Reeker told
reporters. "We made progress."
</P>
<P>
"They launched new negotiations on Agreed Framework
implementation," he added, referring to the 1994 deal, under which
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) agreed to freeze
its nuclear program in return for the West to help with fuel oil
and Western -designed light-water nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
Reeker said the two sides agreed to meet on May 31 to prepare
for a new round of talks on DPRK's missile programs. But he did
not say where to hold the talks.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said a U.S. team made a second visit to the
Kumchang-ri site last week under an agreement negotiated with the
DPRK in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Reeker said the team found that a complex of underground
tunnels at the site, once Washington had suspected to be part of a
nuclear program but found nothing suspicious there in the U.S.
first visit last May, stopped work.
</P>
<P>
"The team reports that the DPRK cooperated fully in the visit,
providing unhampered access which allowed for the rapid completion
of the team's work," he said. "The team found conditions unchanged
since the first visit a year ago.... It remains an unfinished site,
the underground portion of which is an extensive empty tunnel
complex."
</P>
<P>
He said DPRK officials told the team that they would be willing
to consider other uses for the site, which was said to have been
intended as an unspecified "national security-related facility",
including possible commercial uses.

<P>
HARARE, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean police said Tuesday
they are ready to crush any acts of violence that might occur
before and during the parliamentary elections on June 24 and 25.
</P>
<P>
"From our projection we are satisfied that we will be able to
cover all corners of the country where ballots will be cast," said
John Zvimba, chairman of the National Police Committee on the
elections.
</P>
<P>
He said the police had initiated dialogue among the various
political parties and interest groups in order to stamp out
violence and nurture a spirit of tolerance.
</P>
<P>
The police had embarked on a re-training exercise of their
personnel in the handling of public disorder situations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The police force had been equipped with fleet of riot vehicles
known as " crocodiles" and acquired some state-of-the-art
communication equipment to enhance its mobility and communications
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Political violence has been on the rise in the run up to the
country's fifth parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
About 438 people were arrested, 366 injured and 20 killed in
the political clashes in the last three months between supporters
of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front and
the main opposition party Movement for Democratic Change.
</P>
<P>
Zvimba said, however, that reports of violence were declining
countrywide as political parties were cooperating with the police
in maintaining peace and order through dialogue.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Veterans Urged to Leave Farms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabweans Home Affairs Minister
Dumiso Dabengwa Tuesday said the government does not expect war
veterans to resist vacating farms they are occupying once the
state starts resettling people under the amended Land Acquisition
Act.
</P>
<P>
According to the Act signed last month by President Robert
Mugabe, the government will acquire farms without paying
compensation for land. It plans to acquire 841 farms for
resettlement.
</P>
<P>
War veterans leaders said at the weekend their members would
not vacate occupied farms in spite of President Mugabe having
signed the new land law.
</P>
<P>
They said they feared the government would renege on its
promise to resettle them if they moved out before the actual
allocation of acquired land.
</P>
<P>
Dabengwa said, "We do not expect them to do that. They will
have to move out to allow for a proper allocation of land."
</P>
<P>
He said the veterans and villagers who had occupied more than
1,000 white-owned commercial farms would only be allowed to
remain on the farms the government planned to acquire.
</P>
<P>
"If you look at the situation," he said, "Most of the already
designated farms are not occupied and therefore we expect the war
veterans and villagers to move to these as the resettlement
begins."
</P>
<P>
The minister could not say whether he would order the police to
eject the war veterans if they refused to budge as he was
positive that the occupiers would move out on their own.
</P>
<P>
War veterans leader Chenjerai Hunzvi has issued an ultimatum to
the government at the weekend to allocate land to ex-combatants
and villagers before June 24 and 25 parliamentary elections.

LAGOS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations urged Sierra Leone
rebels to allow free movement of 258 UN peacekeepers who had been
encircled for about one month in eastern Sierra Leone, according
to reports reaching here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The UN peacekeeping force spokesman David Wimhurst said in

observers in Kailahun, and 23 peacekeepers in Kuiva, about 50
kilometers east of Kailahun.

He explained, however, the UN troops were not "held in
detention, but submitted to a restriction of movement", adding
that they had been allowed to keep their uniforms and weapons and
to receive supplies.
</P>

The UN appeal came after the release on Sunday of the last of

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia, Eritrea Start Talks on Border Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia and Eritrea started here
Tuesday indirect talks to settle their border dispute under the
auspices of Chief of Organization of African Unity (OAU) and
Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika.
</P>
<P>
The talks started with the discussion of an Ethiopian proposal
on some points of the technical arrangements of the OAU peace
initiative.
</P>
<P>
The initiative enjoys the support of the United Nations and the
European Union as well as the United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The talks were attended by Eritrean Foreign Minister Haile
Woldetensae, his Ethiopian counterpart Seyoum Mesfin, U.S.
President Bill Clinton's envoy and an EU delegation. Bouteflika was
represented by his personal envoy Ahmed Au-Yahya.
</P>
<P>
Before the start of the talks, Au-Yahya said Eritrea and
Ethiopia expressed readiness to respect the commitments made by
their leaders during their separate talks with Bouteflika. "The
preliminary contacts showed that the two sides had good will and
that the mediator Bouteflika was determined to settle the dispute,"
Au-Yahya added.
</P>
<P>
"Bouteflika's intervention helps the Horn of Africa get out of
hell," he said.
</P>
<P>
The first round of talks between the two warring sides held in
Algiers early May failed to reach a satisfactory settlement of the
border dispute, thus giving way to the resumption of fierce
fighting.
</P>
<P>
The shuttle diplomacy conducted by Bouteflika between Addis
Ababa and Asmara where he held talks with Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi and Eritrean President Issayas Aferwerki between May
24 and 26 yielded the agreement of the two countries on the
resumption of talks in Algiers.
</P>
<P>
On May 12, Ethiopia launched a full-scale offensive into Eritrea
to reclaim all land seized by Eritrea since 1998 and demolish the
Eritrean army, sending half a million civilians fleeing. Eritrea
agreed last week to fully withdraw from all disputed territory.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia seven years ago. It
seized the disputed land along the 1,000 kilometer border in 1998,
saying it belongs to Eritrea under colonial-era boundaries.
</P>
<P>
The ensuing fighting between the two neighbors has cost tens of
thousands of lives.

BAGHDAD, May 30 (Xinhua) -- One civilian was injured Tuesday in
U.S. and British warplanes' raids on northern Iraq, an Iraqi
military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 10:15 local time (0615 GMT), eight
formations of U.S. and British jets made 16 armed sorties over
northern Iraqi provinces of Dohuk, Neiveva and Erbil and bombed
civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
At 13:00 local time (0900 GMT), he said, 14 formations of U.S.

provinces.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi air defenses fired missiles at the invading planes,
forcing them to retreat, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, U.S. and British planes taking off

Tuesday's air raids followed reports on Monday that two

The U.S. and British planes have been patrolling the so-called

<HEADLINE> Senior IRGC Commander Assassinated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Senior commander of Iran's elite
Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Rear Admiral Abdollah
Roudaki was shot dead by a gunman Monday night in southern Iran,
the IRGC announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Roudaki, a senior IRGC navy commander during the 1980-88 Iran-
Iraq war, was assassinated by a Mohammad Ansari in the southern
province of Fars, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The assassin, reportedly a retiree of the local agriculture
authority, surrendered to the local police after the shooting, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
The motive of the killing was still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said that sons of the assassin are currently living in Iraq
and said to be aiding the Iraq-based armed opposition Mujaheddin
Khalq Organization (MKO) which has launched scores of attacks on
Iranian interests inside and outside the country.
</P>
<P>
The MKO had once been a famous political-military organization
fighting against the former shah's regime in the 1970s. But it was
outlawed in 1981 and forced to flee to Iraq following sharp
differences with the clergy government brought to power by the 1979
Islamic revolution.

<P>
TEHRAN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps
(IRGC) of Iran has intercepted a Belizean tanker which was
smuggling oil from Iraq, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The oil tanker, with some 1,400 tons of oil in a private
shipment from Iraq, was intercepted by the IRGC's navy while it was
in the Iranian territorial waters, according to an informed
official.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed official, however, did not mention when the tanker
named "MK1" was seized and how many crew members it had.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has to sell oil under a U.N. supervision system, but
smugglers tend to ship oil from the country for high profit.
</P>
<P>
The IRGC intercepted 12 oil tankers smuggling oil from Iraq in
April for violating Iranian territorial waters.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Committed to Resolving Conflicts With Ethiopia Peacefully: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Eritrean Foreign Minister Haile
Woldetensae said here on Tuesday his country is committed to
working for peace to settle the border dispute with neighboring
Ethiopia in line with the peace initiative of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
However, he accused Ethiopia of attempting to invade Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean minister, who leads his country's delegation to the
indirect talks with Ethiopia, was quoted by the Algerian News
Agency as saying the talks in Algiers are a good opportunity to
establish peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The indirect talks started here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Woldetensae praised the efforts made by Algerian President and
current OAU chief Abdelaziz Bouteflika to stop the Eritrean-
Ethiopian fighting and disengage the warring sides to the positions
of June 6, 1998.
</P>
<P>
He accused Ethiopia of trying to occupy Eritrea, pointing out
that the attacks launched by Ethiopia on Monday targeted not only
military but also civilian sites. On the contrary, Ethiopia refuted
that the attacks were directed to military positions only.
</P>
<P>
The Algiers indirect talks between Eritrea and Ethiopia are
being held under the auspices of Au-Yahya, Bouteflika's personal
envoy.
</P>
<P>
The first round of talks, held early May, failed to achieve any
positive result, thus leading to the resumption of fierce fighting
between the two neighbors in the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
The shuttle diplomacy conducted by Bouteflika between Addis
Ababa and Asmara from May 24 to 26 and his talks with top leaders
of the two sides led to their agreement on May 26 to resumption of
the peace talks in Algiers.

<HEADLINE> Russia: OSCE Posing "Exorbitant Demands" on Return to Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Moscow on Tuesday accused the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
Assistance Group of posing exorbitant demands on its return to
Russia's breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The group can "resume its activity in Chechnya at any moment,
even tomorrow," Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander
Yakovenko said.
</P>
<P>
"We made the political decision and agreed to the Group's
return two months ago," the Interfax news agency quoted the
spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Yakovenko said, the return of the group, now staffed
by Austrians, "has apparently been complicated by exorbitant
demands regarding their status."
</P>
<P>
"The premises for the Group's work have been sorted out and it
can work on the same terms its Polish and Norwegian predecessors
worked earlier."
</P>
<P>
Austria is currently chairing the OSCE.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot, for instance, unilaterally revise the OSCE decision
and extend the Austrian diplomats' activity over the whole North
Caucasus.The Group's 1995 mandate does not provide for this," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign diplomats and the members of the Group will naturally
enjoy privileges and immunities as any other mission of
international organizations in Russia," he said. "However, the
demands to grant (them )ambassador's ex-territoriality or, for
instance, the right to give out arms to Chechen members of the
mission obviously exceed normal limits."
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, a set of security guarantees with complete
freedom of movement would prompt us to suspend the anti-terrorist
operation and start exclusively guarding the Group," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Frankly speaking, the impression is growing in us that the
Group's leadership prefers to stay in Moscow rather than in Grozny,
" the capital of the Chechnya, Yakovenko said.
</P>
<P>
"This is understandable from a human point of view, but one
should not invent impracticable terms and then shift
responsibility to Russia for the so-called delay of the Austrians
in Moscow," he said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Registers Growth in Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A senior Russian official said
Tuesday that foreign investment in the country rose dramatically
over the past few months.
</P>
<P>
Andrei Illarionov, President Vladimir Putin's economic advisor,
told reporters that Russia received 10 billion U.S. dollars in
foreign investment in the first four and a half months of this
year, in contrast to 4.3 billion dollars for the whole of last
year.
</P>
<P>
The increase represents "the most striking vote in favor of the
current economic policy" in the wake of perceived political
stability with new president Putin at the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed to an improvement of investment climate in the
country, including the fulfillment of budget indicators and a rise
in Central Bank foreign exchange reserves by 6 billion dollars
during the period.
</P>
<P>
"All this increases the general confidence of the West in
Russia. And Russia has good prospects for an increase in foreign
investments," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the country's overall economic performance, Illarionov said
that despite a 7.9 percent GDP growth posted in the first quarter
over the same period of 1999, some worrying trends have emerged,
such as a drop in the industrial production.
</P>
<P>
"This does not mean that Russian GDP dynamics will be negative
in coming months," but a continued decline in industrial output
could slow the record GDP growth seen in the first quarter and
even lead to a contraction, he said.
</P>
<P>
Illarionov said the government would cut its spending to 20
percent of GDP from the 38 percent to avoid another economic
decline.

BUCHAREST, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Moldova's President Petru
Lucinschi met Tuesday with the executive secretary of Commonwealth
of Independent States (CIS), Yuri Yarov, who is on a two-day visit
to Chisinau.
</P>
<P>
Lucinschi and Yarov discussed issues related to the
organization of the CIS summit on June 20-21 in Moscow, according
to a communique of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Lucinschi reiterated that "cooperation within the CIS could be
efficient only under the economic aspect," saying that all CIS
members must observe the earlier assumed economic obligations. He
referred in particular to a resolution on creation of a free trade
zone within the post-Soviet area that would delete taxes, double
taxation and other barriers in the export of goods.
</P>
<P>
Yarov was named as the CIS executive secretary in April 1999,
he first visited Chisinau in May 1999 to make contacts with the
Moldovan leadership. On the eve of the CIS summit in Moscow, in
January 2000, he visited Chisinau for the second time.
</P>
<P>
The CIS executive secretary is named and dismissed in
accordance with a joint decision of all 12 CIS chiefs. His basic
duties comprise the coordination of common CIS projects and

<HEADLINE> Iranian Parliament for Reform Program: Interim Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Interim Speaker of Iran's Majlis
(parliament) Mehdi Karrubi said here on Tuesday that the newly-
installed sixth parliament has chosen the path of reform and it
should cooperate better with President Mohammad Khatami's
government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, the newly-elected speaker said
the parliamentary election in February, which led to the first
reformist-dominated parliament in the 20-year history of the
republic, is complementary to the 1997 presidential election in
which "the people voted for President Khatami's reform program."
</P>
<P>
The new parliament held its second formal session Tuesday,
during which it elected the interim speaker, two deputy speakers
and the other six members of its presiding board, all of whom are
from the reformist camp.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Karrubi rejected any split between his
party, the Assembly of Combatant Clergy, and the Islamic Iran
Participation Front (IIPF) led by Mohammad Reza Khatami, younger
brother of the president and the No. 1 vote-gainer in Tehran
constituency.
</P>
<P>
The IIPF's failure to nominate its candidate for the post of
parliament speaker aroused speculations that there may be
differences between the two major reformist parties who joined
hands to win a landslide victory over the conservatives in the
February election.
</P>
<P>
All parties within the reformist camp are friends, Karrubi said.
</P>
<P>
The speaker called for cooperation between the parliament and
the government as well as among various political parties in the
parliament to solve the "people's problems," the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed for cooperation from the powerful conservative-
dominated Guardians Council (GC) and the State Expediency Council
(SEC), who are in a position to veto the bills the legislature
passes.
</P>
<P>
Some "unpleasant events" occurred concerning the February
election, Karrubi noted, adding, however, "we should forget the
past and focus on putting into practice our obligations."
</P>
<P>
Following the election, the GC went out of its way to help the
conservative candidates against their reformist rivalries,
including annulment of the eligibility of some reformist winners,
transfer of seats to the conservatives, and delay of the
confirmation of election results.

<HEADLINE> WHO Warns of Tobacco Danger on World No Tabacco Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
has warned that tobacco is dangerous and up to 11,000 people die
everyday due to a tobacco-related disease.
</P>
<P>
"Tobacco advertisements talk to us from our streets, films,
radios,television sets and sports events. Everywhere our children
and we turn, there is something or someone telling you to smoke,"
said WHO Director-General Gro Harlem Brundtland in a statement to
be issued on World No Tobacco Day (WNTD) which falls on May 31.
</P>
<P>
"What makes all this unacceptable and treacherous is that this
dangerous and addictive product is sold to youth and adolescents
as an assertion of their freedom to choose," she said.
</P>
<P>
This year's global WNTD events include the multi-country, multi-
language "Tobacco Kills - Don't be Duped" campaign, with Thailand
as the main venue. Events focusing on the same theme are to be
held in various places around the world.
</P>
<P>
With a focus this year on the entertainment and sports
industries that are the prime vehicles for carrying tobacco
messages around the globe for their largely young audience, WHO
seeks to make the case for a global ban on advertising and
promotion of tobacco.
</P>
<P>
"Our decision to focus on the entertainment, film and sports
industry is a carefully thought one," said the WHO chief. "It is
unconventional and unorthodox, but that is precisely why we have
chosen it, the tobacco industry strikes where people least suspect
it to be."

<HEADLINE> Lumumba Assassination Probe Appoints Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Four history and law experts were
appointed on Tuesday by the Belgian parliamentary commission
investigating the assassination of Congolese independence leader
Patrice Lumumba.
</P>
<P>
The four appointed experts are Jules-Gerard Libois, an expert
from the African documentation center, Luc Devos, a military
expert, Emmanuel Gerard, a history professor, and Philippe Raxhon,
a history professor and critic.
</P>
<P>
Within a month, the four experts are expected to make to the
parliamentary commission proposals concerning the witnesses to
listen to and the archives to consult with.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian Parliament set up on May 2 a special commission
aimed at investigating into the assassination of Lumumba and the
commission met three times this month to formulate the way it is
supposed to work.
</P>
<P>
The set-up of the commission was prompted by Belgian
sociologist Ludo de Witte who has written a book entitled The
Assassination of Lumumba to try to shed some light on the incident.
</P>
<P>
De Witte believes that the then Belgian authorities were
largely responsible for the assassination and destruction of the
body of Lumumba.
</P>
<P>
The Congo, a Belgian colony since 1885, declared independence
on June 30, 1960. Seven months later, Lumumba was assassinated on
January 17, 1961, allegedly at the order of the leaders of the
secessionist province of Katanga of the African country.
</P>
<P>
De Witte believes that Belgium has a hand in the events related
to the assassination, from the transfer of Lumumba to the province
of Katanga, the execution of the independence leader and the
disappearance of his body.

<HEADLINE> Russian Pilots Captured by Angolan Rebels Cross Into Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Five Russian pilots who crossed from
Angola into Western Province of Zambia last Sunday, have handed
themselves over to Zambian border police, Zambian Home Affairs
Minister Peter Machungwa said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister told a news briefing that the Russian government
has been informed of the matter and arrangements are being made to
hand the five Russians including Alexander Yudov and Alexander
Zattsev over to the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
They all appear to be in good health, said Machungwa.
</P>
<P>
The minister did not go into details on whether the five
Russians were released by rebels of National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) or escaped.
</P>
<P>
But, informed sources confirmed last Wednesday that the Pilots
were released by Angolan rebels.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the two planes piloted by the five
russians were shot down in northeast Angola respectively on May 12
and June 30 last year.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan rebels warned in a statement issued by the UNITA
last Wednesday that all nations with citizens in Angola "under any
pretext" did not have "minimum guarantees of security" in the
country's war zones, which it claimed embraced all the Angolan
territory.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, UNITA thanked the Zambian government for its
guarantee to take the released captives to Russia in safety.

<HEADLINE> African States Urged to Boost Pyrethrum Output to Reduce Malaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has urged
the east African countries to increase production of pyrethrum, a
natural insecticide against malaria which kills about 1 million
people in Africa annually.
</P>
<P>
Felix Ugbor, the United Nations Industrial Development
Organization (UNIDO) Country Representative, told a two-day
workshop here on Monday that there is great potential for the
production of pyrethrum in the region, local newspapers reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He told participants from Tanzania, Kenya and Rwanda that UNIDO
is committed to supporting efforts to revive and boost pyrethrum
production in the three east African states which used to produce
about 90 percent of the world total output in 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Opening the forum, Chairman of the National Environment
Management Council Reginald Mengi urged the stakeholders to
restore the old good days when pyrethrum was the leading cash crop
in the country.
</P>
<P>
"It is encouraging to note that the government of Tanzania has
endeavored to revamp pyrethrum production by privatizing this
business... to attain increased production which is expected to
reach 1,000 tons this year and 3,000 tons by the year 2003," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He challenged the local pyrethrum industry stakeholders to work
hard and attain the annual production of over 6,000 tons which was
the highest level ever reached by the producers during 1966/67
season.
</P>
<P>
Pyrethrum production reached its lowest ebb in 1996/97 when
only 450 tons were produced mainly because of poor world market
prices and the deterioration of local processing abilities.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzania Pyrethrum Board launched a campaign to revive the
crop by offering farmers 800 Tanzanian shillings (about one U.S.
dollar) a kilogram while private dealers offer half only.

DAR ES SALAAM, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Some twelve fishermen from
Tanzania's western Kigoma Region have been kidnapped last weekend
by suspected Burundian armed bandits.
</P>
<P>
The Kigoma regional commissioner Abubakar Mgumia confirmed the
incident Tuesday and said investigations were underway.
</P>
<P>
The Kagunga village head Mikidadi Yasin told Tanzanian media on
Monday that a number of armed men attacked the fishermen from his
village when they were fishing in Lake Tanganyika, shared by
Tanzania, Burundi, Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the
Congo.
</P>
<P>
According to the village head, the armed men seized their
fishing gear and took them hostage.
</P>
<P>
Some fishermen who managed to escape reported the case to the
village authorities.
</P>
<P>
Yasin said the missing fishermen were taken at gunpoint in two
boats that headed towards Kabonga village in Burundi.

<HEADLINE> Uganda, Rwanda Begin to Pull Troops out of Kisangani, Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Uganda and Rwanda started
withdrawal of their troops and weapons Monday from positions at
Bangoka International Airport on the outskirts of Kisangani, a
northeastern city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), a
Ugandan army spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Everything is going according to plan. The withdrawal has
started and we estimate it will take 12 days to complete,"
Phinehas Katirima told Xinhua in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
"The situation there is calm" in Kisangani where Ugandan and
Rwandan troops clashed early this month, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and his Rwandan counterpart
Paul Kagame met in Mwanza, Tanzania, two weeks ago and agreed to
avoid further hostilities by withdrawing their troops 100
kilometers from Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda are backing rival rebel groups in a
one-and-a-half- year war against the DRC President Laurent Kabila.

<HEADLINE> Israel Warns Syria, Lebanon Not to "Play With Fire" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy again warned Syria and Lebanon on Tuesday not to "play with
fire" after the Israeli troop withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Briefing foreign ambassadors to Israel at the King David Hotel
here on the Israeli pullout, Levy said there are attempts to
recruit certain forces inside Lebanon and incite them into making
adventures against Israel.
</P>
<P>
The fresh warning came six days after Israel completed its
pullout from south Lebanon early Wednesday, ending 22 years of
military occupation there.
</P>
<P>
"We warn against playing with fire," Levy said.
</P>
<P>
Israel has repeatedly threatened harsh reprisals against
Lebanon, and its main power border Syria, if it comes under attack
after troop withdrawal. Any cross-border attack against Israel,
said Prime Minister Ehud Barak, will be considered as an "act of
war."
</P>
<P>
The border area was quiet on Tuesday, after Lebanese government
restricted civilians' entrance into the border area vacated by
Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Lebanese flocked to the south in the past days to
see by themselves the newly liberated and celebrate Israeli
pullout. Protesters jeered at Israeli border guards, hurled stones
at the other side of the border, or even pressed into Israeli
territory, raising tension along the new, fenced borderline.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Levy accused Iran of continuing weapons supply to
Hezbollah, the spearhead of Lebanese resistance against Israeli
occupation in the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, backed by both Iran and Syria, has
vowed to continue fighting until Israel gives up the disputed
Shebaa Farms and releases all Lebanese detainees from its jails.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria said Shebaa Farms, located at the western
foothills of the Mount Hermon now under Israeli occupation, belong
to Lebanon and should be returned during the Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Israel said the area is part of the Golan Heights it captured
from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war, whose fate should be
decided during peace talks with Syria after they resume.
</P>
<P>
Levy said the United Nations has affirmed that most of the
Shebaa area was not part of Lebanon and Israel need not include it
in the pullout.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace talks stalled again in January after
the two sides held two rounds of talks in the United States since
last December, due to Israel's refusal to promise to hand over to
Syria the entire Golan Heights.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Western Sahara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Tuesday met in a closed-door session to consider a report by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, and would convene an open meeting to
vote on a draft resolution on the disputed territory.
</P>
<P>
Annan, in his report to the Security Council last Tuesday,
called on Morocco and the Polisario Front to come up with specific
solutions to problems that have delayed a referendum on the future
of Western Sahara for more than eight years.
</P>
<P>
Annan said face-to-face talks held on May 14 in London under
the auspices of his special envoy, former U.S. Secretary of State
James Baker, only reinforced the U.N. assessment of "their widely
divergent positions."
</P>
<P>
Also, "neither side offered any constructive suggestions on
the way forward" at their first direct talks conducted by Baker
since 1997, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has long been trying to organize a
referendum to decide whether Western Sahara should be incorporated
in Morocco, which controls most of the former Spanish colony, or
become independent, as sought by the Polisario Front.
</P>
<P>
But the referendum, first set for January 1992, has been
repeatedly postponed due to differences over who should be
eligible to vote.
</P>
<P>
Referring to another round of talks that might be held some
time in June, Annan said he strongly hoped that, as requested by
Baker, "the parties will come forward with concrete proposals at
the proposed meeting."
</P>
<P>
"Given the difficulties over the years in bridging their
recurrent differences, and the fact that no enforcement mechanism
was envisaged in the (U.N.) settlement plan, it would be essential
that the parties now offer specific and concrete solutions to the
multiple problems relating to the implementation of the plan, that
can be agreed to," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Alternatively, they should "be prepared to consider other ways
of achieving an early, durable and agreed solution of their
dispute" over Western Sahara, he said.

ATHENS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
Tuesday discussed with his visiting Belgian counterpart, Guy
Verhofstadt, the developments in the European Union (EU) and
preparations for the coming EU summit in Lisbon, Portugal.

praised the German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer for his
proposal to create a federal Europe.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Confidence Rises Sharply in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumer confidence rose
sharply in May despite volatile stock market and higher interest
rates, the Conference Board, a prominent research group, said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board said in a survey that its Consumer
Confidence Index jumped to 144.4 in May, approaching the all-time
high of 144.7 reached in January. The sharp rise came after three
months of decline and the index stood at 137.7 in April.
</P>
<P>
"Volatile financial markets and interest rate hikes are not
expected to have a significant impact on consumers' spirits," Lynn
Franco,director of the Conference Board's research center.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. stock market has been volatile under the pressure of
higher interest rates in recent months. The Federal Reserve has
raised rates six times since last June in an effort to cool off
the U.S. economy and keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
With the volatile stock market and the higher rates, analysts
expected the consumer confidence index to decline to 136 in May in
belief that the environment in the current financial market would
slow down consumers' spending.
</P>
<P>
But Franco said consumer confidence was expected to remain
strong through the summer because unemployment rate hit a 30-year
low of 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Consumer sentiment is a barometer of the U.S. economy since
consumer spending makes up about two-thirds of the nation's
economic activities.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Urges U.S. to Pull Troops out of S. Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) on Tuesday urged the United States to pull its
troops out of the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum released on Tuesday, the DPRK government said
the withdrawal of U.S. troops will help clear obstacles for the
peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The document accused the U.S. of being the arch-criminal for
the sabotage of peace and security on the peninsula. It said the U.
S. aggression 50 years ago had brought deep sorrow and great
losses of life and assets to the Korean people.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military presence in South Korea, which had been the
cause for the Korean War, is still hindering peace and security on
the Korean peninsula, it said.
</P>
<P>
After the war, the U.S. frequently broke the truce between the
conflicting sides of the Korean War by shipping large amounts of
weaponry into the Korean peninsula, carrying out air
reconnaissance and provocation against the DPRK, and finally
paralyzing the implementation of the truce, said the memorandum,
the document said.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK government has made great efforts to maintain peace
and security on the Korean peninsula by putting forward various
peace proposals on occasions of DPRK-U.S. talks and four-party
talks, it said.

<P>
OTTAWA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Two new deadly cases of E. coli were
found in the Canadian central province of Manitoba, Canadian CTV
Network reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Manitoba health officials have identified two children

Kong showed that portals of the industry and trade category
enjoyed the highest click thru rate, said Thomas Tang, executive
director of the Hong Kong Productivity Council (HKPC) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"To help local advertisers assess the effectiveness of their

<P>
A total of 13 advertisers were recruited from six product
categories including general consumer products, eAuction/eRetail
products, mobile devices, durable products, airline products and
banking and insurance products.
</P>
<P>
According to Tang, during the experimental period, the banner
advertisements of the recruited advertisers were placed on the
sponsored websites over various time periods when the
corresponding impression rate, click thru rate, acceptance
customer demographics response and related data information were
collected.
</P>
<P>
All banners were located on the designated websites on a
rotational basis and consumer response to these banners was
recorded throughout these four weeks.
</P>
<P>
Summarizing findings of the survey, Tang said "the number of
click thru recorded was 50,313, representing 0.35 percent of the
impression level and 3,916 questionnaire respondents were recorded,
representing 7.78 percent of the click thru rate."

TEHRAN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- For the first time in the 20-year
history of the Islamic republic, a woman was elected to the
presiding board of Iranian parliament, the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
Soheila Jelodarzadeh, a professional textile engineer and
spokeswoman of the reformist Islamic Labor Party, on Monday entered
the provisional presiding board as a secretary by winning 150 votes
out of a total of 252 cast.
</P>
<P>
Two other women deputies, Jamileh Kadivar and Shahrbanoo Amani
Zanganeh, were also nominated for vice Majlis speakership, but were
defeated by small margins.
</P>
<P>
The election of a woman to the Majlis presiding board can pave
the way for more active participation of women in the parliament
and society, and can be conducive to the passage of more laws to
raise women's status.
</P>
<P>
The Majlis presiding board has nine members, including a
speaker, two vice speakers and six secretaries.
</P>
<P>
Mehdi Karrubi, a reformist leader, was elected the provisional
Majlis speaker while Majid Ansari and Abolqasem Sarhadizadeh were
chosen by the deputies as vice speakers.

<HEADLINE> India to Set Up Six New SEZs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Indian government announced at the end of March this year
that it would turn four existing Export Processing Zones in Santa
Cruz, Kandla, Vishakapatnam and Cochin into SEZs, which China
first introduced in its coastal areas in late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
According to Maran, 100 percent Foreign Direct Investment will
be allowed in the SEZs without any caps, while another important
feature of the SEZs is that the area will be regarded as a foreign
territory for the purpose of duties and taxes.
</P>
<P>
Goods supplied to the SEZs from other parts of the country, or
the domestic tariff areas (DTAs), will be treated as exports, and
goods brought from the SEZs to DTAs will be treated as imported
goods, he explained, adding that it means there would be no excise
duty on goods supplied to SEZs.
</P>
<P>
The six new SEZs are to be set up in Gujarat, Tamil Nadu,
Orissa, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh, all coastal
states which covered most of the subcontinental country's
coastline.
</P>
<P>
While the conversion of the four Export Processing Zones into
SEZs will be completed within four weeks, the first of the six new
SEZs is expected to become operational by this year, Maran said.

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a related case in the same court, another Myanmar,

accomplice and involved in a criminal conspiracy by helping to
deliver false temporary work passes to the clients, Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
He was also sentenced to one year's jail for having in his
possession one false temporary work pass sticker and another one

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Troops Kill Over 100 Rebels in Latest Offensive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan military said
Tuesday it has killed 116 Tamil Tiger rebels in its latest
offensive operations against the rebels in northern Jaffna
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
A military spokesman here said the army has recovered 14 bodies
of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels.
</P>
<P>
He said the government troops since Monday had launched a "
search and destroy" mission with newly acquired weapons at
Ariyalai, Sarasalai and Chavakachcheri in Jaffna which were
partially taken control by the rebels during the past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
The renewed violence comes after U.S. Under Secretary of State
Thomas Pickering on Monday ruled out support for an independent
Tamil state.
</P>
<P>
Pickering, who was on a one-day visit to Sri Lanka on Monday,
said Washington was opposed to the rebels' campaign for a separate
Tamil state for which the LTTE rebels have been fighting for the
past 17 years.
</P>
<P>
Seven soldiers have been killed in Monday's operations, the
spokesman said, adding that government troops were still
conducting clearing operations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the LTTE struck back Tuesday by ambushing a police
truck with a powerful land mine in the northern town of Vavuniya
Tuesday, killing eight constables and wounding 17 others.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A star-studded NBA Legends team
headed by Clyde Clide Drexler and Dominique Wilkins will play a
three-game series against the Chinese National team in August,
organizers the Chinese Basketball Association and ABC Promotions,
Ltd. announced here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The NBA Legend squad will be coached by basketball Hall of
Famer Rick Barry, who himself is a NBA's 50 greatest.
</P>
<P>
"I even want to play the game myself," the 66-year-old NBA's 50
Greatest Player said in a telephone interview at the press
conference. "And it's a honor to me to coach a team with so many
great players."
</P>
<P>
The three-game series will start on August 11 at the 14,000-
seat Workers Stadium in Beijing. The second game takes place at
the 8,000-seat Tian He Stadium in Guangzhou on august 14. The
last game, on August 17, is at the 10,000-seat Shanghai Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Drexler, a NBA's 50 Greatest Player, was one of three players
in league history to accumulate 20,000 points, 6,000 rebounds and
6,000 assists. After spending 11 years playing for Portland
Trailblazers, where he reached the NBA Finals twice in 1990 and
1992, he helped the Houston Rockets win their second straight NBA
title in 1995. Most recently he coached the University of Houston.
</P>
<P>
Wilkins, known as the Human Highlight Film for his exciting
style of play, ranks 8th all-time on the NBA's scoring list with
26,668 points.  An 9-time NBA All-Star and 2-time NBA Slam Dunk
champion, Wilkins played for the Atlanta Hawks, Orlando Magic, San
Antonio Spurs, LA Clippers and Boston Celtics during his amazing
15-year NBA career.

Dallas Mavericks in 1999 and this season Hu was offered a 10-day
contract by the Orlando Magic before injury sidelined him.
</P>
<P>
"These NBA Legends are Olympians, All-Stars, NBA championship
winners and a very talented bunch of men with vast knowledge of
the game. They will absolutely help China's preparations for
Olympic success in September," said Tom McCarthy, CEO of ABC

<HEADLINE> HK Deregulates Interest Rate Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA) announced Tuesday that the deregulation of Interest Rate
Rules (IRRs) on time deposits with a maturity of less than 7 days
and the prohibition on benefits for deposits other than Hong Kong
dollar savings and current accounts will take effect on July 3,
2000.
</P>
<P>
This is the first of a two-phased plan to deregulate the
remaining IRRs in order to promote market liberalization and
enhance competition of the banking sector. It is also part of an
overall program to reform and further develop the banking system.
</P>
<P>
Under the first phase of deregulation, the IRRs on time
deposits with a maturity of less than 7 days and the prohibition
on benefits for deposits other than Hong Kong dollar savings and
current accounts will be lifted.
</P>
<P>
The second phase, which will remove the IRRs on savings and
current accounts, is scheduled to take place 12 months after the
phase 1 liberalization, subject to the prevailing economic and
financial environment at the time.
</P>
<P>
"Although the first phase of the deregulation is relatively
modest in itself, it brings the system one step closer to the
complete liberalization of interest rates in Hong Kong," said
David Carse, Deputy Chief Executive of the HKMA.
</P>
<P>
"The HKMA will continue to monitor closely the impact on the
banks and developments in the market ahead of the final stage of
deregulation due next year," he added.

<HEADLINE> One Bln HKD Mortgage, Bond Asset Swap Program Signed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Mortgage
Corporation (HKMC) and Dao Heng Bank (DHB) signed an agreement
Tuesday for a 1 billion HKD (128 million USD) Mortgage and Bond
Asset Swap Program.
</P>
<P>
This is the first transaction under the asset swap arrangement
recently launched by the HKMC to enhance the attraction of its
Mortgage Purchase Program to the Authorized Institutions.
</P>
<P>
Under the asset swap arrangement, the HKMC will purchase a
portfolio of mortgage loans from a bank. In return the HKMC will
issue an equivalent amount of debt securities under its Debt
Issuance Program to the bank.
</P>
<P>
The arrangement is a win-win solution that benefits both the
banks and the HKMC.
</P>
<P>
The bank counterparty will enjoy a higher return from the
arrangement. As the prevailing mortgage rate is broadly in line
with the yields of the HKMC's debt securities of 3 to 5 years
maturity, the combined return from the debt securities and the fee
for servicing the mortgage loans for the HKMC will exceed the
interest income from retaining the mortgage loans in its asset
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Profitability of the bank will be further enhanced by the
release of the general provision made in respect of the mortgage
loans.
</P>
<P>
There will be savings in capital charge for the bank as the
HKMC paper carries a 20 percent risk-weighting as compared to a 50
percent risk-weighting for a mortgage loan under the capital
adequacy regime.
</P>
<P>
The liquidity ratio of the bank will also be enhanced as the
HKMC's debt securities qualify as liquefiable assets under the
Banking Ordinance.
</P>
<P>
The asset swap arrangement will help the HKMC to acquire
mortgage assets under the current difficult market environment.
</P>
<P>
The yield enhancement would provide a strong incentive for
banks to conduct such transactions with the HKMC on a regular
basis.
</P>
<P>
This would provide an effective platform for the HKMC to build
a critical mass for its mortgage portfolio.
</P>
<P>
The size of the inaugural program with DHB is 1 billion HKD (
128 million USD). The first tranche of 600 million HKD (76.9
million USD) has been scheduled for settlement in late July or
early August 2000. The balance of 400 million HKD (51.3 million
USD) will be arranged for settlement in the next twelve months.
</P>
<P>
The HKMC is in active discussion with a number of banks with a
view to concluding similar asset swap programs with them in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
"With the asset swap arrangement, the HKMC has turned adverse
market conditions into an attractive business opportunity. The
recent suppression of mortgage rates to levels close to the
annualized yields of the HKMC's debt securities has made this idea
viable," said Peter Pang, Chief Executive Officer of the HKMC.
</P>
<P>
P.S. Tam, General Manager of DHB, said "the arrangement is
beneficial to both the HKMC and the banks which are offered
greater flexibility in the balance sheet management."

HONG KONG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The giant lantern featuring a 277.
2-meter long traditional Chinese dragon has been acknowledged by
the Guinness World Records as the "largest dragon lantern" ever
made, said a Hong Kong SAR government press release on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Millennium Dragon Lantern was presented on December 31,
1999 as part of the celebrations jointly organized and funded by
the HKSAR Government and the Hong Kong Jockey Club at the Happy
Valley Racecourse.
</P>
<P>
A certificate from the Guinness World Records to commemorate
this fact has been received.
</P>
<P>
Commissioned by the Home Affairs Department (HAD), the lantern
took 200 skilled craftsmen in Foshan, Guangdong nine months to
design, manufacture and assemble in the Happy Valley Recreation
Ground where it has been on public view since last December.
</P>
<P>
The dragon lantern's body measured 4.4 meters in height, 2.51
meters in width along its body, 13.9 meters tall from top of the
head to the ground and weighed over 25 tons. Reinforced by a steel
inner frame, its body is covered with silk fabric sewn with 20,000
silver panels.
</P>
<P>
It is lit up from inside by 11,400 light bulbs while 22 cooling
fans prevent it from overheating from the interior. Around the
lantern are 33 pieces of shimmering clouds, illuminated by
colorful florescent tubes.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A schoolmaster in northeast China
was sentenced to 16 years in prison by a local court today for
grafting nearly one million educational funds.
</P>
<P>
Ye Lie, former schoolmaster of the No.6 Middle School in Fushun
city in northeast China's Liaoning Province, grafted nearly one
million yuan of tuition fees that students paid during September
1996 to August 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to government rules, the government-run school has to
hand over all the tuition fees that students paid to educational
authorities. However, Ye and several other staff members at the
school diverted a large sum to secret bank accounts and then put
the money into their own pockets.
</P>
<P>
Other staff involved were given 2 to 12 years' imprisonment by
the local court.

<HEADLINE> Twenty Tech Projects Get HK Govt Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A total of 20 projects with
innovative, technological content undertaken by small, technology-
based and entrepreneur driven companies have been approved for pre-
venture capital funding by the Hong Kong government.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing Tuesday on the Small Entrepreneur Research
Assistance Program (SERAP) under the Innovation and Technology
Fund, Hong Kong Director-General of Industry Francis Ho said that
the 20 approved SERAP projects cover various technology areas.
Nine are on information technology, three on electronics, three on
semiconductors, two on advanced materials, two on biotechnology
and one on environmental technology.
</P>
<P>
"Projects funded by SERAP will normally be carried out in two
phases," he said.
</P>
<P>
Of these approved projects, 19 are provided with matching funds
up to 400,000 HKD (51,282 USD) each under Phase I, which lasts no
longer than six months. During this trial period, applicants have
to demonstrate satisfactory progress of their projects.
</P>
<P>
If satisfactory progress has been shown during Phase I, there
will be further injection of funds for Phase II, which should not
be longer than 18 months, to take these projects to the pre-market
launch stage.
</P>
<P>
The maximum amount of SERAP funds for both Phases I and II of a
project would be 2 million HKD (256,000 USD).
</P>
<P>
However, Ho noted that a biotechnology project was allowed to
proceed to Phase II direct, and would receive a matching fund of 2
million HKD under SERAP.
</P>
<P>
He explained that "the applicant has already carried out
considerable researches on the project before applying for SERAP.
The technical feasibility of the project has largely been
demonstrated in those previous studies."
</P>
<P>
"Since the SERAP was launched in November 1999, a total of 104
applications have been received. Ninety-nine of them have been
processed," he said.
</P>
<P>
SERAP aims to provide pre-venture capital funding on a matching
basis to small, technology-based and entrepreneur driven companies
to undertake projects with both innovative, technological content
and a reasonable chance of successful development of a new product,
process or service that can be brought to the market.
</P>
<P>
Local companies incorporated under the Companies Ordinance and
hiring less than 20 employees are eligible for the program.
</P>
<P>
"Matching contributions from the companies can be in cash and/
or in the form of manpower contributions," Ho said.
</P>
<P>
"Projects funded by SERAP are subject to close monitoring by
the Industry Department. Final reports are required at the end of
both Phases I and II, and progress reports in the interim. Also,
the companies have to comply with stringent accounting
requirements," he added.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Tagore -- Symbol of Traditional Sino-Indian Friendship (1) by Xinhua Writer Liu Yunfei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- When world-famous Indian poet
Rabindranath Tagore left China in 1924, someone asked him "Do you
have anything left? Tagore answered "Nothing, but my heart".
</P>
<P>
Today, he returned to the country he loved, and will be with
the Chinese people forever.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Indian President Kocheril Raman Narayanan together
with Beijing University President Xu Zhihong, unveiled a bust of
the poet today.
</P>
<P>
"Let me wish that memories of the life of this great poet and
his writings will inspire the people of our two countries,
particularly, the youth, to dedicate themselves to the cause of
India-China friendship, and in the process, will enable our two
societies to achieve the mutual contact of hearts and minds that
Tagore dreamed about," Narayanan said.
</P>
<P>
Professor Ji Xianlin, an expert on India in this Chinese
prestigious university, said that the traditional friendship
between the two countries should continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
Tagore's visit to China in 1924 marked the beginning of a new
era in Sino-Indian friendship. During the visit, he told students
at Beijing University that he came to China as a fellow Asian. He
stressed that a "silent Asia" had been striving to find its voice
for a long time. He also said that friendship and unity between
India and China would lay the foundation for a struggling Asia. (

<TEXT>
<P>
Tagore, who was born in 1861 and died in 1941, was the first
Asian winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature.
</P>
<P>
When he was back home, Tagore started to set up an organization
serving as a bridge between the two countries. Through the
establishment of Cheena Bhawan -- the first academic center for
the study of Chinese culture and society in India, he laid a
foundation for new dialogue and intellectual exchange between
India and China.
</P>
<P>
As early as 1881, the 20-year-old poet called Britain's opium
trade in China as a death trade. He also highly praised the
Chinese people's courage and determination to fight against the
Japanese invasion of China in the 1930s and early 1940s, saying
that the Chinese people are unconquerable.
</P>
<P>
"If I could live among you, I could speak to you and you to me,
and our thoughts would live through our close contact. They would
bear fruit, not immediately, but in the process of time. Obstacles
would vanish, misunderstandings would not be possible," Tagore
said in his visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Tagore's bust was placed on the first floor of the Beijing
University's library. After the ceremony, guests from both
countries and students took photos in front of the
bust.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Resumes Peace Talks With MILF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government and Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) peace panels pushed through with
their fourth round of formal talks in the southern part of the
country Tuesday, Philippine News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks resumption comes after the initiative has been
stalled by clashes of government forces and MILF rebels in the
provinces of Maguindanao and South Lanao in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which started at 3:00 p.m. in Cotabato city,
Maguindanao province, went on despite continuing but small-scale
encounters in Maguindanao and in South Lanao.
</P>
<P>
The sites of skirmishes are where MILF's two largest bases,
namely Camps Abubakar and Bushra, are situated.
</P>
<P>
The government negotiators are led by retired Army general
Edgardo Batenga, while the MILF side is spearheaded by Shiek Moner
Bajunaid, the rebel organization's head of the subcommittee on
agenda-setting.
</P>
<P>
Bajunaid was quoted as saying before the meeting that they
would continue tackling issues they left behind after the
declaration of a unilateral ceasefire by the MILF earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
The declaration actually marked the start of a two-week intense
gunbattle along Narciso Ramos highway, a main passage that
connects the provinces of Maguindanao and South Lanao.
</P>
<P>
"We will start again where we left off," he said, referring to
the topics the govenment-MILF panels discussed on March 8 to 9.
</P>
<P>
Bajunaid said despite military attacks on Abubakar and Bushra,
the MILF central leadership has decided not to launch offensive
against government forces.
</P>
<P>
"We (MILF) are here to talk. We will not demand for anything as
decisions should be mutually agreed upon," Bajunaid, who
represented MILF chief negotiator Aleem Abdulaziz Mimbantas to the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Mimbantas, the MILF's chief negotiator, failed to arrive at the
venue of the talks for still unknown reasons.
</P>
<P>
Government negotiator Batenga said both parties have prepared
peace packages focusing on a common concern -- the normalization
of situation in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Batenga said both panels expect fruitful results of their one-
day meeting
</P>
<P>
"Time does not matter really, it depends on them (MILF) if they
would want to extend the meeting today," Batenga stressed.
</P>
<P>
The date of the next meeting has not yet been announced.

increase to 0.81 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from
0.7 percent. The goal is to increase development assistance to one
percent of GDP in five years, she added.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is among the top five priority countries in Asia in
respect of Swedish Development Assistance, she said when replying
to newsmen.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish minister said her government was launching a
parliamentary commission to work out strategy for development
cooperation to ensure a continued way of better and functional
development cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We want to look at cooperation in a holistic way, not in the
traditional manner. It would include trade, foreign policy,
agriculture policy, among others, that interact with each other,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Klingvall said Sweden's cooperation with Bangladesh dated back
to 1962, adding that she was happy with the progress of work
projects supported by her country.
</P>
<P>
Sweden extends about 35 million U.S. dollars a year in
development assistance to Bangladesh, about 14 million dollars of
which are granted under the bilateral framework and 15 million
dollars as concessionary loan to promote bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish minister praised Bangladesh for making a lot of
progress not only in the field of agriculture but also in reducing
the population growth rate, and in economic development.
</P>
<P>
For Bangladesh, poverty is the main problem, she said,
underscoring the need for constructive dialogue between the
government and the opposition to resolve differences through give
and take with a view to developing the country's potentials.
</P>
<P>
Observers here hoped the Swedish minister's one-week visit to
Dhaka would further strengthen the existing development
cooperation between Sweden and Bangladesh, and the new country
strategy prepared by the Swedish government would largely promote
the economic development of the country and help alleviate poverty.

<HEADLINE> Meeting on IT, E-commerce Kicked Off in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 30 (Xinhua) -- More than 50 experts on
information technology (IT) from LDCs (Least Developed Countries)
as well as developed countries gather here Tuesday to discuss IT
and E-commerce development in LDCs.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the meeting is to provide the
participants from LDCs with the latest information regarding e-
commerce and to stimulate a direct exchange of experience among e-
commerce practitioners and analysts from LDCs and developed
countries, said Rubens Ricupero, secretary-general of UNCTAD ( U.N.
Conference on Trade and Development), at the inauguration.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting will provide shortcuts and leapfrogging to LDCs
interested in developing their own e-commerce strategies," said
Ricupero.
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting is also aimed at generating support from
international community for LDCs willing to build capacity in e-
commerce and related areas.
</P>
<P>
"E-commerce is one of the areas in which the economic impact of
globalization is becoming most visible," said Ricupero, "however,
the developing world, the LDCs in particular, has been remarkably
absent from the debates surrounding e-commerce related issues."
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that total e-commerce activities could reach
two trillion U.S. dollars by 2004, while LDCs lag at least 50
years behind developed countries in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"LDCs are backward in e-commerce due to lack of basic
infrastructure, lack of access to internet, no regulations by
governments, and no fund for development," Shashank Kansal,
president of Nepal Information Technology and Telecom
International, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Kansal was hopeful that this meeting would help to promote IT
and e-commerce development in LDCs, who could take the
opportunities to learn experiences and information from developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting is the fourth in a series of regional
encounters organized by UNCTAD on the theme of "E-commerce and
Development".
</P>
<P>
Participating the meeting are over 50 experts and
representatives from some 40 countries, including Nepal, Bhutan,
Mali, Guinea, Zambia, Malawi, Angola, Sudan, Niger, United States,
France, Japan, Australia and United Kingdom.

"Instability to meet the revenue mobilization target, increase
in regular expenditure in comparison to development expenditure
and the growing gap between expenditure and resource mobilization
are some of the unfavourable economic indicators", said the survey.

<HEADLINE> Britain Returns Power to Northern Ireland Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Leaders from both sides of Northern
Ireland's political divide Tuesday called on all parties to set
differences aside and get on with the job of governing.
</P>
<P>
As devolution was reinstated at midnight on Monday, Northern
Ireland's First Minister David Trimble and Deputy First Minister
Seamus Mallon resumed their posts at the head of the power-sharing
executive.
</P>
<P>
Eight of the Ulster Unionist, nationalist Social Democratic and
Labor Party (SDLP), and Sinn Fein ministers returned to their
offices.
</P>
<P>
The former ministers of the anti-agreement Democratic Unionist
Party (DUP) refused to say yet whether they will take up their
seats, when the executive meets for the first time on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The executive comprises Trimble, Mallon and 10 other senior
ministers -- three Ulster Unionists, three SDLP, two Sinn Fein and
two DUP members.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said all sides must live up to their obligations to
ensure success for the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the political ally of the Irish Republican Army (IRA)
, said its two ministers would honor their commitments under the
Good Friday peace accord which set up the shared government.
</P>
<P>
The cross-border ministerial bodies and North-South Ministerial
Council will also restart work under the Good Friday Agreement
signed in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
In February, Britain suspended the first joint government of
unionists and republicans after 72 days when the IRA refused to
disarm. Three weeks ago, the IRA said it would put arms "beyond
use" from its war against British rule and allow foreign
independent monitors to inspect them.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre
Chevenement will hold a television debate with German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer on European federalism, one week after
Chevenement accused Germany of "dreaming of the Holy Roman-
Germanic Empire."
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted Chevenement as saying on Tuesday

as saying.
</P>
<P>
In response to Fischer's proposal for a European federation,

Fischer proposed that Europe build a federal-style structure
with a directly elected executive, a European Constitution and a
two-chamber parliament based on the model of the German parliament.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Sends Fleet to Supervise Enforcement of Sino-Japanese Fishery Agreement (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A fleet of six Chinese fishery
management ships set out today for the East China Sea from
Shenjiamen Port in Zhoushan, in east China's Zhejiang Province
preparing to supervise the enforcement of the New Sino-Japanese
Fishery Agreement to take effect on June 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The fleet will cruise and check fishing waters stipulated in
the agreement to ensure that no Chinese or foreign fishing ships
illegally enter the area.
</P>
<P>
Starting from June 1, Chinese fishery management aircraft will
also take part. A temporary co-management fishery zone will be set
up between 27 degrees and 34.4 degrees north latitude, 52 nautical
miles beyond the respective basic territorial sea lines of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Fishing activities in the zone will be managed by China and
Japan while areas on either side of the zone will be under the
jurisdiction of the respective countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, the first that China has signed with its
neighbors based on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the
Sea, marks a new era for China's fishing management, which extends
from offshore waters to China's exclusive economic zone, said Liu
Jian, vice minister of Agriculture at today's ceremony.

<P>
However Liu conceded that the fishery agreement will greatly
affect China's traditional fishery industries because many Chinese
fishing ships will have to retreat from the east side of the co-
management zone when the pact goes into effect.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that more than 17,000 Chinese fishing ships
will be out of work and some 170,000 fishermen will be affected.
In Zhejiang alone, the fishing output will be cut by a million
tons on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
Liu told a group of fishermen at the port that the government
will do its utmost to help these fisherman find other jobs.
Meanwhile he has urged local government officials to take concrete
steps to reform the traditional fishery industry in line with
sustained development.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen the fishing management work, the China National
Commanding Center for Fishing Management was established recently.
One of its major tasks is to command the cruise and inspection on
China's exclusive economic zone and coordinate law enforcement
activities between Chinese fishery management departments and
their foreign counterparts.

<HEADLINE> Survey Finds 20 Percent Of Middle School Students Smoke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A worldwide survey shows that more
than 20 percent of students in China's junior high schools have
tried smoking. Many of them may become habitual smokers in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Out of some 12,000 students aged between 13 and 15, 32.5
percent of boys and 13 percent of girls have tried to take up the
habit. The average smoking rate is 22.5 percent, and the average
age of taking the first puff is 10 years of age.
</P>
<P>
"Although 92 percent of the students know that smoking is
harmful to health, 22 percent of boys and 4 percent of girls say
they may or certainly will smoke in the future," says the survey
organizer Sun Jiangping, a youth health specialist at the Medical
College of Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
The survey is part of an ongoing Global Youth Tobacco Survey (
GYTS) launched by the Tobacco Free Initiative of the World Health
Organization together with the United Nations Children's Fund.
The survey aims at monitoring prevalence of tobacco use and better
understand and assess the attitudes of students in China who take
up the habit.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the students have been exposed to passive
smoking at least once a week, even though 80 percent of them know
that passive smoking is harmful.
</P>
<P>
The first three ways to get cigarettes includes buying them at
stores and from vendors, from peers and adults.
</P>
<P>
Although China's law prevents businesses from selling tobacco
products and alcohol to people under the age 18, 83 percent of
student who smoke admit that they have never been refused
cigarette from sellers.
</P>
<P>
"Teenagers who begin smoking at a younger age are more likely
to become regular smokers and are less likely to quit smoking,"
says Professor Yang Gonghuan at the Chinese Academy of Preventive
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
They urge the government to increase education among youngsters
while taking stricter measures against the sale of tobacco and
advertising.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted in 186 schools in Tianjin, Chongqing,
Shandong and Guangdong.

<HEADLINE> Water Pollution in Major Rivers, Lakes Controlled (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- China has made headway in
controlling water pollution in three rivers and three lakes, which
are most polluted, but more arduous efforts are needed to achieve
the pollution controlling targets set for 2000, officials said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Lu Xinyuan, Director of the Pollution Control Department of the
State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA), told
reporters that pollution of the rivers of Huanhe, Liaohe and Haihe,
and the lakes of Taihu, Dianchi and Caohu has been greatly
controlled and their water quality improved. But major
tributaries of the rivers and sections of the lakes are still
polluted.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe it will take several decades and billions of
dollars to clean up the above mentioned rivers and lakes.
</P>
<P>
About 3,600 of the 5,100 industrial firms who discharge 100
tons of waste water or more in the basins of the rivers and lakes
each day have met state waste discharge requirements, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
But in the Haihe and Liaohe river basins about 550 firms have
failed to meet state requirements.
</P>
<P>
And to make matters worse, most domestic sewage in many cities
are discharged untreated into rivers due to an acute shortage of
waste water treatment plants.

The Huaihe River runs across China's densely-populated
provinces of Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu and Shandong. The Haihe River
runs through Beijing, Tianjin and several other provincial areas
in northern China, while the Liaohe River flows through northeast
China.
</P>
<P>
The Taihu lake in east China near Shanghai, the Dianchi Lake in
Yunnan Province, southwest China, and the Caohu Lake in east China
's Anhui Province are also the country's most polluted lakes due
to industrial pollution.
</P>
<P>
River basins are home to several hundred million people, but
filthy water in some sections of the rivers has caused heavy
financial losses to local residents, fishing industries and even
the human health of some residents.
</P>
<P>
Slow progress in the construction of urban waste water
treatment plants is also blamed for the water problem.
</P>
<P>
Under the central government's 1996-2000 program to control
water pollution in the rivers and lakes, 235 waste water treatment
plants should be built by the end of this year. However, only 24
are operational with 110 being constructed and 101 yet to be built
because of funding problems, the director said.
</P>
<P>
As most domestic waste water in these regions goes untreated,
it is difficult for targets to be met by the central government
this year, he said.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Move "Secret Talks" to Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the Palestinians have
decided to move their "secret talks" from Stockholm, Sweden, to the
Middle East, Israel Radio reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted a senior Israeli source as saying that the two
sides have agreed to continue the "secret talks" in the region, but
he refused to name the exact location where the talks were to be
held.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations at Stockholm broke off on May 21 after Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak recalled the Israeli negotiating team
from Stockholm following a wave of violent anti-Israeli
demonstrations in the Palestinian territories that left at least
six Palestinians dead and hundreds of others wounded.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, who headed the
Israeli team to the "secret talks," said on Monday that progress
had been made in the talks, which were aimed at forging a peace
deal between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides have a very serious approach and it is possible to
speak of progress in view of the ultimate decisions which must be
made by Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat," he said.
</P>
<P>
Other Israeli officials also said the Stockholm talks have so
far been productive and a "loose agreement" on what the final-
status deal will look like is beginning to take shape.
</P>
<P>
There have been unconfirmed reports that, during the last round
in Stockholm, Israel gave up its claim to control the border
crossings between Palestine and Jordan and Egypt and acquiesced to
this being done by an international body. And Israel was ready to
give up 90 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian and Israeli officials met Monday evening to discuss
the release of more Palestinian prisoners and conditions of hunger
striking Palestinian prisoners in various Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian prisoners have been on hunger strike for over 20
days, demanding the release of all Palestinian prisoners be
guaranteed in the framework agreement.

<HEADLINE> Arafat's Adviser Refutes Israeli Official's Aggressive Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Leader Yasser Arafat's
advisor Nabil Abu Rdainah on Tuesday refuted Israeli Public
Security Minister Shlomu Ben Ami's hostile remarks, urging Israel
to give up its annexation and occupation policies.
</P>
<P>
Radinah told reporters here that the Palestinian National
Authority
(PNA) rejected the Ami's remarks made on Monday, which said,"The
Palestinians should drop the dream of full Israeli withdrawal (from
occupied Arab territories) and the right of Palestinian refugees'
return."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian "red line" is clear and based on the
international legitimacy resolutions and the land-for-peace
principle, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also called for a U.S intervention to push the sluggish
peace process on the Palestinian track, stressing that the ongoing
meetings and contacts between the Palestinian and Israeli
negotiators were fruitless under the "waste-time and recalcitrant
tactics" by the Israeli side.
</P>
<P>
The disclosed talks in Stockholm, Sweden, between Palestinian
and Israeli negotiators suspended on May 21 in the wake of the
recent fierce clashes between Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli
soldiers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
A high ranking Palestinian official said on Tuesday that the
two sides were scheduled to resume their talks Tuesday on the
release of more Palestinian prisoner from Israeli jails and the
transfer of territories.
</P>
<P>
However, Rdainah said that there was no Palestinian decision to
return to the disclosed talks with Israel under Israel's
recalcitrant policy.

<TEXT>
<P>
The minister told reporters, "Though I had said that we would
aim at a 20 percent growth while releasing the Exim policy, we
have now fixed an 18 percent growth target as the gem and jewelry
sector after a high growth rate of 30 percent last year is
expected to grow by only 12 percent."
</P>
<P>
Despite a lower 12 percent growth of gem and jewelry, we are
confident of an 18 percent growth as the textiles, which accounts
for one-third of the country's total exports, is expecting to post
a high 28 percent growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
The country's exports growth in 1999-2000 was a little over the
targeted 11.5 percent at 37.53 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's International Reserves Strong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's total international
reserves as at end-April this year was at 34.4634 billion U.S.
dollars, which showed the country's reserves were strong, usable
and not encumbered, according to a Bank Negara (central bank)
spokesperson Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The reserves comprised official reserves assets of 32.67
billion U.S. dollars and other foreign currency assets of 1.798
billion U.S. dollars, she told a press briefing here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
As at end-April 2000, Malaysia's position was favorable as its
net inflows of foreign currency assets amounted to 495 million U.S.
dollars due to returns from high reserves and small external debt
repayments.
</P>
<P>
In addition, government guarantees of foreign debt falling due
within a year was about 226 million U.S. dollars, while foreign
currency securities issued with embedded options where bond
holders have a right to put it back to the government in the next
12 months amounted to 650 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia did not have any undrawn, unconditional credit lines
provided by or to other central banks, international organizations,
banks and other financial institutions or engage in options in
foreign currencies vis-a-vis ringgit, the spokesperson said.
</P>
<P>
She said Malaysia, as a subscriber to the International
Monetary Fund's (IMF) Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS),
will provide detailed disclosure of its international reserves and
official foreign currency liquidity position with effect from May
31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The data would be released on a monthly basis at the end of
every month with a one-month lag to provide forward looking
information, not only on the size of reserves, but on the type and
usability of reserves and the future and potential inflows and
outflows of foreign exchange of the next 12-month period, thus
enhancing the assessment of vulnerabilities and foreign exchange
risk exposure, she said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Malaysia releases data on the international reserves
on a fortnightly basis with a one-week lag.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Fiji's army Commander Frank
Bainimarama said Tuesday night that coup leader George Speight
would be granted an amnesty after the country's political crisis
was over, the Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported.
</P>
<P>
The AAP quoted Bainimarama as saying to BBC that Speight would
be granted an amnesty despite his "criminal act."
</P>
<P>
Bainimarama said he would honor an offer of amnesty made to
Speight by Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara when he was President.
</P>
<P>
"That was a promise made by his excellency (the president) and
we intend to carry that forward," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pressed if that meant Speight would be able to walk free from
the parliament compound, he responded: "Yes, I am sorry to say
that."
</P>
<P>
Bainimarama seized power Monday night and Tuesday issued a
decree revoking Fiji's 1997 constitution, which had restored
political rights to Fiji's ethnic Indians lost after the 1987
military coups.
</P>
<P>
The military regime replaced that of President Ratu Sir
Kamisese Mara, announced only three days ago.
</P>
<P>
Ratu Mara stood down and took refuge on a navy patrol boat, the
AAP said.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Warns U.S. Against Jeopardizing ABM Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Tuesday warned the United States against jeopardizing the Anti-
Ballistic Missiles (ABM) treaty signed with the former Soviet
Union in 1972.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the committee of the presidents of the
Parliament Assembly of the West European Union at the Elysee
presidential palace, Chirac said he is worried about the U.S. plan
to build the National Missile Defense system, which will result in
the abandoning of the ABM.
</P>
<P>
"I don't hide my reservations in regard to any initiative which,
far from completing the international mechanism for controlling
armaments, could jeopardize the ABM, which is one of the pillars
of strategic stability in the past 30 years."
</P>
<P>
Chirac said the scrapping of the ABM will damage the efforts by
the international community to stop nuclear proliferation and will
spark a new round of strategic arms race around the world.
</P>
<P>
"How can you convince those countries to give up obtaining new
arms, while the most powerful think it necessary to develop
technologies which undermine the strategic balance which was so
difficulty acquired?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
He said that from a judicial point of view, the ABM is
something between the U.S. and Russia. "But it also concerns the
whole international community and in particular the European Union
countries, whose security space is directly affected by it."

European Union at the Elysee presidential palace, Chirac said
France will encourage the EU to adopt a clearer strategy for the
Balkans during its EU rotating presidency which begins on July 1.
</P>
<P>
"A summit meeting between the European Union and the countries
of ex-Yugoslavia ... could perhaps help clarify the objective (of
EU) and re-launch a dynamism (for cooperation)."

"EU should find a solution to the endemic crisis in the Balkans
... It (A summit) is the only one which can bring to this region
the framework of peace and stability which it falls short of," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that an EU policy for ex-Yugoslavia should include
encouragement for Croatia to go ahead with its democratic process
and support for Macedonia and Bosnia in building peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said "the door will be equally open" to the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia if Belgrade moves in the direction which is
wanted by the EU.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Striker Batistuta Signs For AS Roma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Argentina's national striker Gabriel
Batistuta has formally signed to play for AS Roma soccer club for
three years starting next season, his manager Settimo Aloisio
announced in Buenos Aires on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"In order to avoid any trouble with fans," Aloisio told Italian
news agency Ansa that "we put it into black and white at my house,
together with my great friend Franco Baldini."
</P>
<P>
"There are no novelties to the agreement we had already worked
out to transfer 'Bati' to Roma," he added, "but I do not want to
go into details over
financial aspects because I think that AS Roma chairman Franco
Sensi will do that today in Rome."
</P>
<P>
The signing of the contract came after a long negotiation which
saw the former Fiorentina striker also tempted by Internazionale,
which next season will play in the European Champions League.
</P>
<P>
The deal with Inter would have involved Roma's city rival Lazio
buying him from Fiorentina and then selling him to the Milan club.
</P>
<P>
Batistuta, 31, will reportedly get 36 billion lire (about 18
million U.S. dollars), over the next three years, while Fiorentina
picked up 70 billion lire (About 35 million U.S. dollars) to trade
the player.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine stiker left Boca Juniors in 1991 for the Florence
club for less than 5 billion lire (about 2.3 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
During his nine years in Florence he has scored 168 goals in
269 division matches, a club record, and even stayed with the club
when it was relegated to the Serie B.
</P>
<P>
Batistuta is expected to return to Rome June 6 to undergo
medical tests.

</P>
<P>
The website, first of its kind in the country, offers business
to business (B2B) services, including publishing full-scale and
instantly-upgraded information on the specialties and providing on-
line exchange platform for manufacturers and dealers.
</P>
<P>
Wang Honghai, chief officer in charge of marketing with techan.
com.cn, said that it is necessary for the Chinese E-business
companies to deal with something they are good at to face the
challenge from international giants, and the Chinese specialties
are the wise choice because they are rooted in China and familiar
to Chinese companies.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, with the development of Internet, consumers'
interest is changing from common products to special and unique
products. Many of Chinese specialties are individually made by
people's hands instead of machines.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the website will cooperate with the Ministry of
Agriculture in helping standardize management of Chinese
specialties. It will also work together with other famous
websites in China, specialties providers, hotels, shopping malls,

<HEADLINE> Yunnan to Be China's Largest Flower Production Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan Province
will be turned into the largest flower production and export base
both in China and Asia, said Huang Bingsheng, deputy governor of
Yunnan Province, here today.
</P>
<P>
Located on Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, Yunnan is well known as "
kingdom of plants", "garden of nature" and "botanical genes bank."
</P>
<P>
Yunnan boasts a variety of about 2,500 wild flowers, most of
which are rare species and valuable primitive breedings, said
Huang at a press conference held here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Yunnan's flower industry developed much
rapidly. From 1994, the output of fresh cut flowers of the
province stands first place in China.
</P>
<P>
The flower sales of the province accounts for 40 percent on
domestic market with flower growing area expanding to 1,729 ha in
1999 from 16 ha in 1994. The number of flower enterprises rise to
250 in 1998 from 79 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang, Yunnan now has three big flower production
areas, including Kunming temperate fresh cut flower production
area, the tropical flower production area in Xishuangbanna and
Yuanjiang and cold bulb flower production area in Diqing and
Lijiang.
</P>
<P>
The annual flower output in the province reaches 1.1 billion
bunches.
</P>
<P>
To promote the development of flower industry, the province
invested 160 million yuan to build a 313-ha floriculture
production park. Some parks will also be planned in Xishuangbanna,
Jiangchuan and Yuanjiang.
</P>
<P>
The province is also to develop flower export-oriented
enterprises with the supports of funds and technology, Huang said.

<HEADLINE> Beijing To Designate 2nd Source of Drinking Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Beijing plans to make the nearby
Guanting Reservoir its second major source of drinking water in
order to relieve the current water shortage.
</P>
<P>
At present, the city's drinking water mainly comes from ground
water and the Miyun Reservoir in Beijing's northwest suburbs.
</P>
<P>
"We must take various steps -- planting more trees around the
reservoir and cleaning the water -- to secure another major
drinking water source for Beijing as soon as possible," said Liu
Qi, mayor of Beijing, during a recent inspection of the Guanting
Reservoir.
</P>
<P>
With a total storage of 4.16 billion cubic meters, the Guanting
Reservoir used to provide a certain amount of drinking water to
Beijing, but lost its status as a water source in 1998 due to
serious pollution.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has long suffered from water shortage, and an average
Beijinger only has 300 cubic meters, or one-eighth of the country'
s average amount, or one-thirty-second of the world's average
amount a year.
</P>
<P>
"Groundwater in the Beijing area has dropped 2.3 meters in the
past months due to the ongoing drought, and if the dry weather
continues, we'll soon face a serious water shortage," said a local
water administration official.
</P>
<P>
His administration is now making a detailed plan to clean the
Guanting Reservoir, he said.

<HEADLINE> More Polluting Firms in China Meet Discharge Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Eighty-five percent of China's
polluting firms had met the official pollutant discharge
requirements by the end of April this year thanks to a five-year
campaign to curb industrial pollution, officials said here today.
Lu Xinhuan, director of the Pollution Control Department with the
State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA), said
progress was made as local governments across China are trying
hard to see that all the country's 234,200 polluting firms meet
the requirements set by the central and local governments by the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Following more than 18 years of double-digit economic growth,
the Chinese government decided in 1996 that all polluting firms
must meet pollutant discharge standards by the end of 2000 in
order to halt the worsening environmental deterioration.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that progress has been uneven between the
country's prosperous eastern region and poorer central and western
regions.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that 91 percent of the polluting
industrial firms in eastern China, 78 percent in central China,
and 64 percent in the west, have met the requirements.
</P>
<P>
China has shut down over 65,000 polluting firms, mostly small
ones, over the past three years to protect the environment and
save natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Industrial firms which fail to meet standards by the deadline
are likely to face revocation of their production licenses, shut-
downs, economic sanctions such as fines, or suspension of bank
loans, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has been encouraging clean industrial
production and the use of cleaner energy, such as natural gas and
cleaner coal, in its energy and communications sectors over the
past four years.

<HEADLINE> World Economy Shows Strong Growth in 1999: UN Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The World economy is estimated to
have grown by 2.6 percent in 1999 compared to a forecast of 1.9
percent made last year, said a survey launched here Tuesday by the
United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and Pacific
(ESCAP).
</P>
<P>
The growth was largely achieved on the back of strong growth in
the U.S., higher growth in the European Union and tentative signs
of recovery in Japan, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
Both developed and developing economies have performed better
than expected in 1999, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries in Asia and Pacific have performed
significantly better than was forecast last year, with their
collective growth rate near two percentage points higher than the
forecast early last year.
</P>
<P>
"Prospects for 2000 are optimistic," said the survey, "ESCAP
developing countries should grow at around 6 percent compared to 5.
5 percent in 1999."
</P>
<P>
The challenges, however, comes from both external and domestic
factors, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Externally, a slowdown in the U.S., absence of a sustained
recovery in Japan, a higher oil prices or a combination of all
three would pose a major challenge to sustained growth in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Domestically, in the short term, job losses incurred by further
corporate restructuring and continuing problems in the financial
sectors would also hamper growth.
</P>
<P>
Over the medium term, maintaining export competitiveness and
reducing reliance on fiscal measures to sustain growth raise
difficult policy issues, the survey said.

<P>
MAPUTO, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A meeting of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC), to take place this week, is to
advise the region's heads of state on whether to boycott the OAU
summit, scheduled for mid-July in the Togolese capital, Lome.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Mozambican President and SADC chairman
Joaquim Chissano in Nigeria on Tuesday, according to a report by
Mozambique News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has been campaigning for a boycott, if
the summit venue is not changed, because of the involvement of the
Togolese government in assisting the Angolan rebel movement UNITA,
thus violating the sanctions imposed by the United Nations
Security Council against UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Abuja, where he took part in a special session of
the heads of state of the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS), Chissano said "an SADC ministerial meeting will
take place this week, but I do not know the date, to provide
advice to the heads of state".
</P>
<P>
"We must make a study to see what the situation is and know who
will take part or not", said Chissano, adding that "we must carry
out a study before we can say anything".
</P>
<P>
As for ECOWAS' position on the matter, Chissano said that "from
all that I could gather here in Abuja, it seems that all ECOWAS
member countries will take part in the summit".

<HEADLINE> China to Firmly Open to Outside World: Article </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- China's Chief Negotiator on the
entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), Long Yongtu, said
China will firmly stick to the policy of opening to the outside
world as the country's full membership in the WTO approaches.
</P>
<P>
Long said in an article in today's overseas edition of the
People's Daily that the agreement China reached with the European
Union on China's WTO entry, and the passage of permanent normal
trade relations status by the U.S. House of Representatives, have
cleared the way for China's entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
China will take an active approach in participating in the
economic globalization of the world, he said, because that is the
only way China can become a major economic power.
</P>
<P>
Long said that China must accomplish three tasks in the face of
economic globalization -- build a socialist market economy, stick
to the policy of opening to the outside, and act in accordance
with international norms and regulations.
</P>
<P>
China's entry into the WTO poses serious challenges to economic
management departments of the government, he said, and those
departments will have to change their current functions and adapt
to the needs of developing a market economy.
</P>
<P>
In bilateral negotiations with members of the WTO, China has
given up demands in technology transfer and foreign exchange
balance and localization, because the government wants less
interference in the running of individual enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Long urged China's enterprises to make use of the advantages of
joining the WTO, and protect their own rights.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China's decision to sharply reduce its tariffs, to
remove a large number of non-tariff trade barriers, and to
gradually open its service market, is aimed at cutting the cost of
competition for enterprises, and therefore is favorable to Chinese
firms.
</P>
<P>
"Without opening to the outside world, Chinese enterprises will
never be strongly competitive in the international market," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Some people in the United States doubted whether China would
keep its pledges after China and the United States reached WTO
agreement, Long said, but China will keep all its pledges.
</P>
<P>
"this is because all the pledges China made are in line with
China's interests, with China's policy of reform and opening to
the outside world, and with China's participation in the world's
economic globalization," he concluded

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- China is "gravely shocked" and "
strongly dissatisfied" over the incident that a Chinese fishing
boat was attacked and a fisherman shot dead by Philippine maritime
guards in the South China Sea, Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side has for a number of times made representations
to relevant authorities of the Philippines, and Chinese diplomats
have visited other fishermen still detained by the Philippine side,
Zhang said at a regular press conference this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese side hopes that the Philippine side will release
both the boat and fishermen at an early date, preserve the remains
of the fisherman, make compensations according to international
convention, and adopt effective measures to prevent such incidents
from happening again," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
On Sino-Indian relations, Zhang said that Sino-Indian relations
are now stepping into an improvement and development process,
thanks to efforts from both sides.
</P>
<P>
Indian President Narayanan's ongoing visit to China has further
promoted the growth of Sino-Indian ties, she added.
</P>
<P>
Zhang expressed the hope that the Indian side will keep to its
commitments in not allowing any separatist activities in its
territory.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese side has expressed appreciation of Indian
government's admission that Tibet is an inseparable part of China
and of its commitment that it won't allow the Dalai Lama Group to
carry out separatist activities in its territory."
</P>
<P>
China adamantly opposes anyone using the Tibet issue to carry
out separatist activities, she reiterated.

and mutual accommodation."
</P>
<P>
When it comes to the reforms of the United Nations (UN)
Security Council, Zhang stressed that the representation rights of
developing countries should be considered a priority.

Premier Qian Qichen will attend the funeral of former Japanese
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi to be held by the Japanese government

<P>
MANILA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine economy rose by 3.45
percent during the first quarter of the year from measly 1.5
percent in 1999, but lower than the government's 4.1 percent
target due to lower-than-expected growth of agriculture and
services sectors.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference, National Economic and Development
Authority Director-General Felipe Medalla said the agriculture
sector only grew 0.2 percent during the first quarter as against
the target of 2.28 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said services growth of 3.88 percent also fell short of the
target of 4.58 percent due to the lingering effects of the crisis
on the
financial subsector, which rose merely by 1.58 percent.
</P>
<P>
Trade however rose 4.78 percent while communication services
leaped by 9.58 percent to push the transport, communication and
storage subsectors growth.
</P>
<P>
Medalla said industry grew remarkably by 4.88 percent
surpassing the target of 4.18 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen manufacturing's 20 subsectors posted increases, led by

<HEADLINE> Improvement Needed for Developing Thai E-Commerce:  Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While many countries are currently paying close attention to
what is necessary to make e-commerce a reality, Thailand, however,
is not close to become a true e-commerce nation, according to a
report from the National Science and Technology Development Agency
(NSTDA).
</P>
<P>
For that reason, it said, Thailand needs to do a great deal
more on several vital fronts, from the creation of the necessary
infrastructure for a nationwide information superhighway, to its
inadequate number of telephone lines and computers.
</P>
<P>
Although the establishment of an information technology
superhighway network is critical to the successful emergence of e-
commerce, Thailand does not currently possess such a network
covering the entire country, it said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that another restriction is the limited number of
telephone lines and computers.
</P>
<P>
Another major factor behind the country's low e-commerce growth,
it said, is its lack of production capability in terms of internet
devices, and the country should be able to produce such devices,
including personal computers, mobile phones and so on.
</P>
<P>
The report also said legislation is another key infrastructure
for the emerging of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the first two e-commerce laws, Electronic
Transaction Law and Electronic Signature Law, have been approved
by the Thai cabinet and it's expected these laws will be submitted
to the parliament next month, it said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Defence Industry Asked to Improve  Productivity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Defense Minister
Najib Tun Razak Tuesday urged the local defense industry to strive
to improve quality and productivity while it could still take
advantage of competitive labor cost and technical capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The local defense industry now has a modest capability to
manufacture light aircraft, aircraft parts, rifles, small arms and
medium calibre ammunitions, and "head to toe" basic needs for
members of the defense forces, he said in a speech at the
launching of the Malaysian Defence Industry Council (MDIC) website
here, which was read out by the ministry's Secretary-General
Hashim Meon.
</P>
<P>
However, he said Malaysia has not yet reached the level of
being able to design or manufacture own defense products and
export them internationally.
</P>
<P>
He said while being well-positioned to get contracts from
Europe,Japan and the United States and enjoy reasonable access to
global markets as well as support of international partners, the
local defense industry should nurture that privilege towards
lasting relationship.
</P>
<P>
He is optimistic that the local defense industry is assured of
a bright future if it can be more focused.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Export 1 Mln Tons of Wheat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is expected to export 1
million tons of wheat this year due to surplus production of two
millions tons above the target.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Federal Minister for Food and Agriculture
Shafqat Jamot while addressing a press conference here Tuesday
</P>
<P>
Jamot said that of the total, 600,000 tons will be exported to
Afghanistan and 400,000 tons to some other countries.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that some foreign countries, such as Sri Lanka have
also expressed their interest to buy wheat from Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Jamot said that the country will not import wheat this year and
this will save foreign exchange of 300 million U.S.dollars in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
He said that the country has produced 10.5 million bales of
cotton, 5.1 million tons of rice, surplus of onion and potatoes
and 21.5 million to 22 million tons of wheat production is also
expected. The government's target of wheat is 20 million tons this
year.
</P>
<P>
Due to good and surplus production of major and minor crops the
agriculture growth rate this year will cross the double digit, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Jamot said that the government has fixed a procurement target
of 7 million tons of wheat while 6.6 million tons have been
achieved. The provinces will purchase the wheat from the farmers
to facilitate and encourage them.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Opposition Parties Submit Censure Motion Against Mori </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Japan's three main opposition parties
submitted Tuesday a nonbinding censure motion against Prime
Minister Yoshiro Mori to the upper chamber over his remark that
Japan is a divine country with the emperor at its center.
</P>
<P>
The parties said in their bill to the House of Councilors that
Mori's remark ran counter to Japan's constitution, which
stipulates that sovereignty resides with the people. They added
that Mori lacks the qualifications necessary to be a prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
The three parties are the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), the
Japanese Communist Party (JCP) and the Social Democratic Party (
SDP).
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Party (LP) did not join in submitting the motion,
but LP members said they would support it.
</P>
<P>
The motion is expected to be killed at a plenary session
Wednesday by the ruling coalition, which enjoys a majority in both
houses of the Diet (parliament).
</P>
<P>
Once the censure motion is rejected in the upper chamber, the
four opposition parties plan to submit a no-confidence motion
against Mori's cabinet to the House of Representatives, or low
house.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of lawmakers linked to Japan's Shinto religion on
May 15, Mori said, "Japan is a divine country with the emperor at
its center. We have been working for 30 years to have people
firmly acknowledge that."
</P>
<P>
Mori apologized at a news conference last Friday for his remark
having caused misunderstanding, but he refused to retract the
statement.

<HEADLINE> Swiss FM Calls for Speedy Integration with EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Swiss Foreign Minister Joseph Deiss
has called for his country's speedy integration with the European
Union (EU), according to Swiss Radio International Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Deiss said that Switzerland's goal should be entry into the EU
but denied that the government will begin negotiations on it soon.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Zurich Monday, the Swiss foreign minister said that
it is important to create conditions to start negotiations, but
the country won't seek a full EU membership until the Swiss people
agree.
</P>
<P>
"We must spend the time before we enter the EU carrying out
necessary domestic political reforms," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the overwhelming vote by the Swiss people on May
21 was in favor of a series of bilateral free trade accords with
the EU, indicating that a wide range of debate on the question of
European integration was necessary.
</P>
<P>
Deiss's comments came just one week before a session of the
parliament, during which the assembly will debate on whether the
government should start EU membership talks immediately or not.
</P>
<P>
However, Deiss rejected the "Yes to Europe" initiative, saying
that those who want to make the discussion center on the immediate
opening of negotiations are losing sight of the real goal of the
EU entry.
</P>
<P>
"No one can say when the ideal time to open negotiations will
be," he said, noting that it would be unrealistic to imagine they
could start in the current legislative period, which ends in 2003.

<HEADLINE> France Calls for Coordination of ECB, Governments over Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
Tuesday called for a better coordination between the European
Central Bank (ECB) and the governments of the 11 euro zone
countries in keeping the single currency stable and competitive.
</P>
<P>
Jospin made the statement in a speech to heads of central banks
attending celebrations of the 200th anniversary of the Bank of
France, including ECB president Wim Duisenberg and U.S. Federal
Reserve President Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the drop of the value of euro this year should
make Europeans think about launching joint actions in future
between the ECB and the governments of the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
"The independence of ECB does not exclude dialogue with the
political power," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation between political and monetary leaders is
especially concerned with exercising in the field of exchange.
Political authorities decide orientation of policy while ECB
conducts operation of exchange," he added.
</P>
<P>
The 11 member countries of euro have established Euro-11, an
informal forum of their finance ministers who meet once a month to
discuss economic coordination in the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
Jospin said that Euro-11 and the ECB should better coordinate
with each other.
</P>
<P>
The value of euro has dropped by about 20 percent in its
exchange rate with the U.S. dollar since the beginning of this
year.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Jobless Rate Remained High in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Japan's seasonally adjusted
unemployment rate maintained high even though it dropped 0.1
percent in April from a record 4.9 percent in February and March,
the Management and Coordination Agency said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The agency attributed the improvement partly to the decline in
the number of graduates failing to find jobs.
</P>
<P>
The monthly jobless rate for men stood at 5 percent, down 0.2
percentage point from March, while the rate for women was
unchanged at 4.6 percent, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The agency said the number of employed people totaled 64.4
million in April, down 290,000 over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
A report released by the Labor Ministry on Tuesday showed that
the ratio of job offers to job seekers improved in April, with 56
jobs offered to every 100 people looking for jobs.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the latest unemployment data, Japanese Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a press conference that he still
felt cautious about Japan's employment situation despite the
slight improvement in April.

United States will increase 9 percent this year and 3 percent in
2001.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Doubt Raised on Yugoslav Participation in Euro 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- As the countdown ticked toward the
kick-off of this year's European soccer championship, the
participation of one of the 16 finalists was put in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
Some Albanians and Kosovar Albanians now residing in Belgium,
co-hosts with the Netherlands to the quadrennial event, appealed
to the local authorities to ban the entry of Yugoslav players.
</P>
<P>
Georges-Henri Beauthier and Luc Misson, two Belgian lawyers
acting on behalf of the Albanians as well as the Brussels-based FC
Kosova soccer club, forwarded their case to the Belgian court that
is scheduled to hear it on June 2, eight days prior to the kick-
off of the championship, hailed as the third largest sports gala
in the world.
</P>
<P>
The first and second events are the World Cup soccer tournament
and the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Koen Vervaeke, spokesman of the Belgian foreign ministry, told
Xinhua on Tuesday that he did not see any reason to refuse
issuance of travel visas to the Yugoslav players in that, though
the European Union has imposed traval sanctions against the Balkan
country but the players are not on the list of those banned.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel said that none of the
players is on the black list and actually most of the Yugoslav
players have been playing in big-name European clubs.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry together with the interior ministry are in
charge of issing entry visas into Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The question on the Yugoslav participation was first raised on
Monday when the two lawyers contacted the foreign and interior
ministries about the issuance of visas.
</P>
<P>
When asked what if the local court ruled against the issuance
of entry visas, the foreign ministry spokesman said that he did
not see reason for panic since the Belgian government is acting in
accordance with the EU decision on travel sanctions against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, Yugoslavia, though finished atop of group
preliminaries, was banned from participating in the then European
soccer championship. The ban was announced only 10 days prior to
the kick-off by the Union of the European Football Associations(
UEFA), the governing body of the sport in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Denmark replaced Yugoslavia in the 1992 tournament and went as
far as taking the trophy by beating Germany two goals to nil in
the grand finale.
</P>
<P>
The UEFA, however, did not say anything so far this time around
as regards a ban on Yugoslav players.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia was drawn to play with Slovenia, Norway and Spain in
Group C in the forthcoming tourney. The Yugoslavs are to meet
Slovenia on June 13 at Charleroi, Belgium.

CAIRO, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs from
the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey's industrial conglomerate Suzer Holding has
raised its stake in Bulgarian cardboard producer ZMK Nikopol to 98.
5 percent through buying 3 percent of the company's stocks,
reported Turkish Daily News on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
ZMK Nikopol is a leading paper-maker in the Balkans with an
annual output of around 80,000 tons. The company exports 80 percent
of its products to Turkey, Slovakia, Romania, Russia, Ukraine,
Egypt, Iran, Greece, Macedonia and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
Suzer continues to probe overseas investment opportunities in
finance, tourism, energy, construction and land development, the
company said in a statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian exports to the United States in the first
quarter of this year rose by 46.4 percent over the same period of
last year, a report said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The increase was mostly attributed to non-oil products export,
which soared by 35 percent to 186 million U.S. dollars in the first
three months of 2000, said the report prepared by Egypt's trade
representation office in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Oil exports increased by 20 million dollars in the period, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The report added that the trade volume stood at 1.13 billion
dollars in the first quarter of 2000 between Egypt and the U.S..
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- International rating agency Noody's predicted that
Turkey's year-end consumer inflation would reach 44.3 percent
against a government target of 25 percent, reported Anatolia News
Agency on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A Noody's analysis said that by the end of 2001 consumer
inflation would drop to 18 percent, compared to a government
projection of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Noody's estimated that Turkey's outstanding external debt will
reach 103.5 billion U.S. dollars by the end of 2000 and 112.7
billion dollars by end-2001.
</P>
<P>
The agency indicated that the current government is showing a
surprising capacity for constructive and decisive policy making
despite being made up of a disparate three-party coalition.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt will privatize six companies by the end of June
and another 40, currently under assessment, will be offered for
sale in 2001, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The English-language paper quoted Minister of State for Public
Business Sector Mokhtar Khatab as saying that so far 154 public
companies have been fully or partially privatized, 46 percent of
the enterprises chosen for the program.
</P>
<P>
The state has received revenues of 12.6 billion Egyptian pounds
(3.65 billion U.S. dollars) from the sale of the state-owned
businesses, Khatab said.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkish exporters are trying hard to break the U.S.
trade barriers for sale of dried fruits in the U.S. markets,
reported Turkish Daily News on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At a conference organized Monday by the Aegean Dried Fruit
Exporter Union in Izmir, western Turkey, Turkish exporters said
that the U.S. was blocking Turkish dried grape exports with very
strict standards which were not applied in any other part of the
world.
</P>
<P>
The Union Chairman, Erdinc Kapkac, said that Turkey exports 200,
000 tons of its 250,000 tons of dried grapes to more than 80
countries and is the second biggest dried grape exporter in the
world.
</P>
<P>
But Turkey cannot export the dried grapes to the U.S. because of
its strict chemical criteria.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is preparing for a possible
conflagration at Mount Dov, where there are no civilians but a lot
of IDF soldiers, and the disputed Shebaa Farms, senior military
sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the relative quiet along the northern border Monday
after Lebanese forces restricted access to the frontier, the army
expects hostilities to resume once the United Nations verifies that
Israel has complied with U.N. Security Council Resolution 425 and
completed the pullback to the border.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Hezbollah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah said Monday
that his group will not disarm, despite Israeli withdrawal from
southern Lebanon, in order to face "Israel's daily threats." He
also vowed to continue attacks against Israel if the Shebaa Farms
at the foot of Mound Dov remain under Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Following months of bickering between Israel and the
Palestinians over the location of the northern security passage
between the West Bank and Gaza Strip, it was finally decided that a
transit station would be set up at Mevo Horon on the Green Line.
</P>
<P>
In certain circles, Israel's agreement to establish the passage
at a location that the Palestinians originally wanted is seen as a
concession. Furthermore, there are those who believe that Israel is
signaling its willingness to come to terms with the main
Palestinian territorial claims.
</P>
<P>
The Taba accords between the two sides established that two "
safe passages" would be created between the West Bank and Gaza
Strip for the use of the Palestinian population. A series of
discussions took place over the issues of travel permits and
security, and solutions were finally reached. The southern passage
was opened several months ago.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The Tel Aviv District Court decided at a hearing Monday that
Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid and Mustafa Dirani, both held without trial
by Israel for several years, will stay in prison until a July 12
ruling.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the two men took their case to court following the
government's decision not to release them, in contravention of a
Supreme Court decision that ordered the release of all Lebanese
prisoners held without trial in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The government argued, however, that Obeid, affiliated with the
Shiite Muslim guerrilla Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Dirani, a leading
member of the Shiite Amal movement, constitute a treat to the
security of Israel and should be kept in Israeli prisons.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- In a landmark decision, the High Court of Justice ruled
Monday that it is legally possible for a child to have two mothers
and instructed the Interior Ministry to register a woman as the
adoptive mother of the biological son of her lesbian partner.
</P>
<P>
The two women, Ruthie and Nicole Berner-Kadish, have lived
together for several years and hold American and Israeli
citizenship. They currently live in California, but plan to return
to Israel at the end of their studies.
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Ruthie bore a son after undergoing artificial
insemination, following a joint decision made by the couple. Nicole
adopted the boy in a California court, and the two are registered
as his parents on the child's birth certificate.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Negotiators to Meet Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA CITY, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat said Israeli and Palestinian negotiators were due to meet
Tuesday to discuss the release of Palestinian prisoners and further
land transfers.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two sides would discuss the interim issues
including the release of more Palestinian prisoners and the opening
of the northern safe passage route linking Gaza Strip and the West
Bank. However, he did not mention the time or venue for Tuesday's
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The talks would also tackle the third and final phase of Israeli
troops redeployment in the West Bank by Israel's self-imposed June
deadline, including the planned handover of three Arab villages on
the outskirts of Jerusalem to full Palestinian control, said the
negotiator.
</P>
<P>
Erekat dismissed as baseless a report by Israel's Ha'aretz
newspaper that the two sides had reached an agreement on setting up
a transit station at Mevo Horon on the so-called Green Line, the
former divider between Israel and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
He also declined to comment on a report by the Palestinian
newspaper al-Ayyam that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had asked
Israeli and U.S. officials to move the back-channel negotiations in
Stockholm to the region.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was reportedly to have said that it would be better for
the negotiating teams to be closer to their leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel have been holding back-channel talks
in the Swedish capital in a bid to forge a framework for a final
peace deal after decades of conflict. The existence of the parallel
channel was revealed May 14, the day after the two sides missed a
second deadline for the framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
The talks, halted by Israel on May 21 after an explosion of
deadly violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, deal with the most
thorniest issues, including the status of Jerusalem, borders, water
sharing, the fate of the Palestinian refugees and Jewish
settlements.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military Pledges to Crackdown Anarchists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Chief of the Indonesian Military (
TNI)Adm. Widodo said here Tuesday that the TNI will not tolerate
any kind of anarchic actions in the country, and pledged to take a
strict action against anarchists.
</P>
<P>
"In any reason, such an action can not be tolerated again,
because it do harm to the interests of the public, the nation,and
the state," Widodo told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said that the TNI deeply regretted that the anarchic actions
were taking place at the time the Indonesian government made
efforts to uphold law enforcement, and to respect human right
values in the country.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the police to take a strict measure against
rioters.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, Indonesia has been rocked by sectarian
conflicts and other anarchic protests in some regions including
its capital city Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, at least five military cars were set on fire by
angry protesters when they staged protests demanding the
seriousness of the government in taking legal actions against
former president Soeharto who was charged with corruption cases
during his 32-year rule.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two bomb blasts rocked a church and a restaurant in
Medan, capital of the Indonesia's North Sumatra province, on
Sunday and Monday, injuring at least 51 people.

<P>
COLOMBO, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Eight Sri Lankan policemen were
killed Tuesday when a police vehicle in which they were travelling
got caught to a land mine at Pompemadu in the northern Wanni
region, the government said.
</P>
<P>
Another 10 policemen were wounded due to the explosion, said a
government statement.
</P>
<P>
It said at the time of explosion the police vehicle was moving
from Purawasakulam to Vavuniya in the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
However, it did not reveal who is responsible for the explosion.
</P>
<P>
The government usually blames past land mine blasts or bomb
attacks on separatist Tamil Tiger rebels who in recent weeks have
been engaged in a ferocious assault in a bid to retake their
former stronghold of the northern Jaffna peninsula.

<TEXT>
<P>
With 55,000 Indian children getting addicted to tobacco every
year, India has 240 million tobacco users who represent nearly one-
third of the 0.8 billion tobacco users in the developing world,
said the WHO, adding that tobacco deaths in India account for 15
percent of global tobacco deaths.
</P>
<P>
The theme for this year's World No-Tobacco Day was "
Entertainment and Tobacco Production -- Countering the Deception".
</P>
<P>
According to Martha Osei, WHO South-East Asia Region advisor,
the tobacco industry, through advertisements, deliberately entices
young children, who are ignorant of the harmful effects of tobacco,
to smoke.
</P>
<P>
Smoking is not really an adult choice as claimed by the
industry, said Osei.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Gov't Urged to Provide Security Guarantee for Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Director of the Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX), Mas Ahmad Daniri
said Tuesday that the composite index on the JSX dove on Monday to
the lowest level since April last year partly due to lack of
security guarantee for investors.
</P>
<P>
"The fall of composite index on the JSX on Monday is influenced
by the weakening of rupiah and lack of security guarantee for
investors," Daniri told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta composite index dropped 20.69 points (4.29 percent)
from 482.07 last Friday to close at 461.389 on Monday, the worst
since April 1999.
</P>
<P>
Losers beat gainers 134 to nine with 45 stocks being unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Daniri said that the fall of index was also influenced by
market mechanism.
</P>
<P>
"Investors will only buy shares if they think such a decision
will bring them benefit, but if they don't think so, they won't (
buy shares) on the JSX," Daniri added.
</P>
<P>
But he also said that index on the Jakarta bourse reflected the
future of economic situation instead of the current ones.
</P>
<P>
However, he is optimistic that index will rebound and regain
strength in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"The fall of index on the JSX yesterday was just a temporary
symptom," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, analysts here said that major foreign and local
investors dumped their stocks on fears that the bombings of a
church and a restaurant in the provincial capital of North Sumatra
on Sunday and Monday would trigger more chaos.
</P>
<P>
"There are great market disappointments to what has developed
recently in the domestic political and security conditions," an
analyst, Juni Hendry said.
</P>
<P>
In related development, after reaching its intraday low of 8,
667 per U.S. dollar, the rupiah closed down at 8,570 per dollar on
Monday as compared to 8,495 last Friday.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday the rupiah opened at 8,575 (buying) and 8,750(
selling) against the U.S. dollar.

<HEADLINE> East African Police Urged to Dismantle Drug Cartels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Police forces in east African
 countries have been urged to unify their strengths and act
aggressively to flash out all drug barons.
</P>
<P>
Opening a four-day operational meeting for directors of
criminal investigation and anti-narcotics units in East Africa
here on Monday, Tanzanian Inspector-General of Police Omari Mahita
called for joint efforts to apprehend and prosecute drug barons to
free the region from drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper Tuesday quoted the police chief as
saying that it would be meaningless to apprehend and prosecute
only peddlers of illicit drugs while barons are left to continue
with their dirty business in the region.
</P>
<P>
He called on the police forces in Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda and
Tanzania to cooperate in the war against illicit drugs and
cross-border crimes.
</P>
<P>
According to Mahita, law enforcers in Tanzania managed to seize
a total of 63.7 kilograms of illicit drugs in 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
Some 192 Tanzanians were arrested abroad in connection with
illicit drug trafficking in the last four years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is one of the countries affected by drug trafficking
and abuse in the African continent due to its geographical
location, police sources said, adding that it is an important drug
transit point to Southern and Eastern African countries.
</P>
<P>
They admitted that drug control has been a big problem because
drug cartels are often in the hands of rich and famous people.

<P>
NAIROBI, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Kenya Airways has announced a
194-percent increase in net profit during the past financial year
which ended on March 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The airline posted a net profit of 2.9 billion shillings (about
39 million U.S. dollars), 1.9 billion shillings (about 26 million
dollars) more than the 1998 figure, the East African Standard
newspaper Tuesday quoted Kenya Airways as saying.
</P>
<P>
The past year was "by far the most successful in the
23-year-history of Kenya Airways", said Chairman of the board
Isaac Okero here on Monday at the headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Airways, the biggest airline in sub-Sahara Africa, has 10
aircraft serving 25 destinations in Africa, the Middle East, India
and Europe.
</P>
<P>
The company's network building and alliance building are always
yielding positive results, Okero said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that tangible profits continue to be realized from its
alliance with Dutch airline KLM, which holds more than 20 percent
of Kenya Airways' shares.

</P>
<P>
He made the remark at the "2000 Sino-ROK Investment and Trade

The ROK has become Xinjiang's second largest trading partner,
with trade volume between the two totaling 63 million U.S. dollars

<P>
LHASA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Deputies to the Regional People's
Congress of Tibet vowed to narrow the gap between Tibet and other
parts of China in the shortest possible time, and work hard toward
the goal of common prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The deputies attending the third session of the Seventh
Congress of Tibet Autonomous Region agreed that the region should
take the advantage of the national campaign to develop western
China to speed up the region's infrastructure construction,
highway building in particular.
</P>
<P>
The highways to be constructed include those between China and
Nepal, and between Tibet and Qinghai and Sichuan provinces and the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The region will open more air routes, expand water, thermal,
and wind power production capacity, launch a telecommunications
network, and make early preparations for the construction of the
first railway in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
During the current session, deputies reviewed development in
infrastructure, education, non-public sector, and poverty
elimination over the past year.
</P>
<P>
Tibet invested 5.6 billion yuan in fixed assets last year,
surpassing any previous year. Work on 50 key projects beginning
last year are underway at a cost of 1.9 billion yuan, and twenty-
one of them had been completed.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, the regional government had allocated 281
million yuan to build 129 aid-the-poor projects encompassing water
conservancy, agriculture, animal husbandry, and transportation. As
a result, the grain output of 18 poor areas in Tibet increased by
12.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The number of individual industrial and commercial firms in
Tibet rose to 41,000, employing a total workforce of 60,000 by the
end of last year. Also, the school enrollment rate increased to 83.
4 percent, and adult illiteracy dropped to 42 percent.

<HEADLINE> China to Produce 40 Mln Tons of Oil, Gas Equivalent By 2005 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- China expects to see an annual
average increase of 20 percent in offshore oil and gas production
from 2001 to 2005, as it launches a massive development drive to
produce oil and gas equivalent to 40 million tons of oil by the
year 2005.
</P>
<P>
According to Wei Liucheng, president of the China National
Offshore Oil Corporation, China will give priority to developing
oil in the Bohai Sea and natural gas in the East China Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Penglai 19-3 Oilfield in the Bohai Sea, which has verified
geological oil reserves totaling 600 million tons, will be put
into operation by 2004, with annual oil production capacity
forecast at 15 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The Xihu Depression in the basin of the East China Sea is
particularly rich in natural gas resources, with proven and
probable gas reserves topping 150 billion cubic meters. Experts
expect the total gas resources in the depression to hit one to two
trillion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
According to Wei, a group of rich oil and gas bearing
structures have been discovered in areas of the Bohai Sea, East
China Sea, and South China Sea, providing opportunities for the
country to launch large-scale oil and gas development in the 21st
century.

<HEADLINE> Capital Goods Prices Continue to Rise in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The prices of capital goods
continued to rise in April in China after picking up in March this
year, the State Administration of Internal Trade (SAIT) said today.
</P>
<P>
The April prices were one percent higher than that of March,
and two percent higher than the same month last year, according to
figures from the SAIT.
</P>
<P>
Prices of capital goods began declining in April 1996, and only
picked up this March, edging up 0.4 percent on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
Total sales of capital goods in April amounted to 419 billion
yuan, surging 13.9 percent on a year-on-year basis.
</P>
<P>
In that month, China's imports soared 32.8 percent, more than
70 percent of which was capital goods. Exports of major capital
goods such as steel, coal, and non-ferrous metals also grew by
more than 50 percent on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
Analysts from the SAIT attributed the price rise to the steady
increase of domestic demand and foresaw a more balanced supply and
demand in May, which might push the prices higher.
</P>
<P>
The sales volume of capital goods in May is expected to reach
415 billion yuan, with prices going up 2.5 percent over the same
month last year.

<HEADLINE> Possible Floods for Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Water Resources
predicts that floods may occur in the Yangtze River Valley this
summer.
</P>
<P>
This forecast is based on the fact that more rain is expected
on the upper reaches of the Yangtze and the Hanjiang river valleys,
especially during the plum rain season, which begins on June 16 on
the Chinese lunar calendar.
</P>
<P>
Authorities note that the eight provinces and municipalities
along the Yangtze are not sufficiently capable of fighting floods,
despite the fact that China has poured more investment into the
construction of water-control facilities.
</P>
<P>
The State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters has
urged concerted efforts to fight against flooding if it comes, and
examine the safety of local embankments.
</P>
<P>
China has suffered a number of great floods since 1991. In 1998,
severe flooding in the Yangtze River Valley aroused concern at
home and abroad, and last year flooding occurred again in the
region.

<HEADLINE> Analysis: Internet More Trend Than Bubble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Though there is wide speculation
that Internet is overvalued and it may be a bubble that could
break any time, it will, in the long run, be a substantial part of
mankind's life instead of an empty concept piped up with stories
of dotcoms, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that e-transformation has created huge business
potential and that the Internet is here to stay and grow, despite
the current stock market volatility," said Kwong Ki-chi, Chief
Executive of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd, earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question of whether there is an Internet
bubble nowadays, Intel Chairman and CEO Craig Barret said that "
the bubble has perhaps burst for some companies, but consolidation
of Internet business has appeared, the winning companies will be
valued properly."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the speculation over the "Internet
bubble" is a result of too many companies in all the different
categories.
</P>
<P>
There will be winners and losers in any business and the market
places have started to look for fundamental financial
characteristics in dotcoms just as they look for fundamental
financial characteristics in telecom companies or semi-conductor
companies, according to the head of the world's No 1 chip maker.
</P>
<P>
"They look for revenues, they look for products, they look for
profitability. We are going to see valuation suggested on the
basis of those fundamental factors, not just on how innovated and
distant the idea is," Barrett said.
</P>
<P>
After the recent market correction of the Internet-related
stocks, it has almost become a common view that Internet has
enormous positive impact on business, but whether a company is a
dotcom or not, it has to survive the tough market competition by
solid business and good management.
</P>
<P>
James B. Haybyrne, Chairman of the Hong Kong-based Strategic
Thinking Group, said that many Internet companies are basically
following very old business models without anything fundamentally
new in what they are doing.
</P>
<P>
"Many of the dotcom companies cannot answer the very simple
question of business strategy, which is what we sell, to whom and
where to sell. They are overvalued just because people do not
quite understand the Internet world," said Haybyrne.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that a lot of the companies that are making money
by selling advertising space on the Internet rather than real
products are going out of existence within the next year or two.
</P>
<P>
Christopher Justice, CEO of Asiacontent.com,Ltd, described the
market correction as a healthy thing, saying that investors will
become increasingly sophisticated with respect to what Internet
company is valuable.
</P>
<P>
"Investors have already told Internet companies that Internet
is not just concept any more. It is real fundamental business,"
Justice said.
</P>
<P>
"What the market is telling all Internet companies today is you
have to show us you have got a substantive business, a scalable
business, a business where you can demonstrate that you can get a
return on investment, ultimately reach that break-even point and
make sure that break-even point is sooner rather than later," he
affirmed.

<HEADLINE> Public Support For Japanese Cabinet Plunges to 19 Percent: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Public support for Japanese Prime
Minister Yoshiro Mori's cabinet has sunk considerably over his
controversial remark that Japan is a divine nation centering on
the emperor, a leading Japanese newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mori's popularity rate has now plunged to 19 percent from 41
percent in early April.
</P>
<P>
The disapproval rate for the cabinet has jumped to 62 percent
from 26 percent last month, the Asahi Shimbun said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper surveyed 2,000 randomly selected eligible voters
across Japan by telephone on Sunday and Monday, of whom 1,150
responded.
</P>
<P>
Of the respondents, 67 percent said Mori's remark is
problematic, compared with 23 percent who said it is not.
</P>
<P>
Mori, at a press conference last Friday, apologized once again
for "causing misunderstanding among many people" for his May 15
remark while refusing to retract it.
</P>
<P>
Regarding his explanation, 60 percent of respondents said they
were not satisfied with it while only 23 percent said they were.
</P>
<P>
At a May 15 meeting of lawmakers linked to Japan's Shinto
religion, Mori said, "Japan is a divine nation with the emperor at
its center. We have been working for 30 years to have people
firmly acknowledge that."
</P>
<P>
Critics said the comment not only reminded people of the
ideology that drove Japan's wartime militarism, but also ran
counter to the separation of religion and state as enshrined in
Japan's constitution.

<HEADLINE> China to Expand Coal Gas Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- China is planning to step up coal
gas development and Sino-overseas cooperation in this sector over
the next five years with the aim of producing 10 billion cubic
meters of coal gas by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang Yicheng, chairman of the executive council
of the China Energy Research Society (CERS), the country is very
rich in coal gas resources, with between 30 trillion and 35
trillion cubic meters within a depth of 2,000 under ground, an
amount ranking third in the world.
</P>
<P>
The senior expert said that China plans to establish four or
five coal gas production and utilization bases between 2001 and
2005, and verify recoverable coal gas reserves of between 400
billion and 450 billion cubic meters during the same period.
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive industrial system of coal gas production and
utilization will basically take shape by the year 2005, he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the country's coal gas and natural gas resources
are mutually complementary in regional distribution, with the
former mainly in the central and eastern parts of China, which are
short of natural gas resources.
</P>
<P>
Northern China is particularly rich in coal gas resources,
which account for 62 percent of the country's total, the expert
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Indian President Kocheril Raman
Narayanan said today that India and China should work together to
push forward the establishment of a new political and economic
world order.
</P>
<P>
In his address at Beijing University, the Indian president said
that the appropriate code of conduct for a globalized world would
be the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, jointly initiated
by India and China.
</P>
<P>
He denounced the theories that have been advanced of
globalization extinguishing national sovereignties and the
exciting diversities of the world, and creating some kind of
uniform and monolithic system as "unsustainable, and destructive
of a democratic world order."
</P>
<P>
Narayanan, who visited Beijing University when he served as
Indian ambassador to China in the 1970s, said that India and China
can cooperate in the international field for peace and stability
in the world, and for equality and justice for developing
countries and for an equitable multi-polar world order.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that the two countries could closely work
together to bring about democratic transformation of the United
Nations to serve the interests and aspirations of mankind as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Indian relations have been founded on solid understanding
of the affinities of cultures and civilizations of the two
countries, and the imperatives of peaceful co-existence and close
cooperation between them in the post-cold war world, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that India-China friendship and cooperation
could be a good example of concord and harmonious relations
between the two ancient civilizations and the foundation for a
just, stable and peaceful world order.

<HEADLINE> Karrubi Elected Provisional Majlis Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Mehdi Karrubi, a prominent leftist
leader, was elected on Tuesday the provisional speaker of Iran's
new (Majlis) parliament, which is dominated by reformists.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Majid Ansari and Abolqasem Sarhadizadeh were elected
vice Majlis speakers.
</P>
<P>
In the second open session of the new Majlis, Karrubi won 186
votes out of a total of 249 in the election of a provisional
presiding board broadcast live by state radio.
</P>
<P>
A total of 251 Majlis deputies were present at the session, but
two of them did not cast votes.
</P>
<P>
Karrubi, the former Majlis Speaker, was the sole candidate for
the post of speaker after the leading reformist party the Islamic
Iran Participation Front (IIPF) announced not to introduce its own
candidate for the post in order to prevent any differences among
reformist parties and groups.
</P>
<P>
The IIPF leader Mohammad Reza Khatami, the younger brother of
President Mohammad Khatami, said on Monday that the IIPF decided
not to nominate candidate for the post of the speaker in the new
parliament so as to prevent eventual discrepancies among groups of
the reformist coalition "May 23 Front."
</P>
<P>
Most of the 18 groups in the coalition have announced to support
the candidacy of Karrubi, who is the secretary of the reformist
Assembly of Combatant Clergy and also enjoys support from the
conservative camp for the post after former President Hashemi
Rafsanjani abandoned his seat in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
But reports said that the IIPF had the intention to introduce
Mohsen Mirdamadi, a non-cleric member of the IIPF, to run for the
post of speaker as two other prominent reformist leaders Mohammad
Reza Khatami and Behzad Nabavi, the coalition's spokesman, declined
to be nominated for the post.
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's election, both Khatami and Nabavi withdrew their
candidacies for the posts of vice speakers.
</P>
<P>
A permanent presiding board will be elected after all
credentials of the parliamentarians have been confirmed. It is
believed that Karrubi will remain as the speaker in the permanent
board.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Karrubi announced his readiness to accept
the nomination for the speakership of the new Majlis, which was
sworn in on Saturday, putting an end to the conservative dominance
of the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Karrubi, 63, was first elected Majlis speaker in 1989. Three
years later, he failed even to retain a seat in the fourth Majlis
as most of his allies were also ousted by the conservatives.

<P>
"We have to look at our entire package of aid to Fiji, and
establish which programs, if continued, could inadvertently
support an unconstitutional government," New Zealand Minister in
Charge of Overseas Aid Matt Robson said in the press release.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand government Monday announced a package of
sanctions it would take to send a clear message to the Fiji's coup
leaders. The options being considered include freezing new
development aid and reviewing existing projects.
</P>
<P>
The minister said his country does not want to cut programs
focused on people's benefits, independent from government.
</P>
<P>
"We have to get this right. What we don't want to do is make the
same mistake that was made in Iraq when innocent children and
civilians ended up paying the highest price for sanctions," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
"It's important that we look at our aid package on a case by
case basis, and ask the question of each program, 'if we cancel
this funding, who do we punish?'" he said.
</P>
<P>
Robson said the actions of the Fiji's coup leaders will not be
condoned by the international community.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's current bilateral program in Fiji is in total 5
million NZ dollars (about 2.4 million USD).

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia announced Tuesday
morning that it had withdrawn troops from western Eritrea "after
completely shattering Eritrean positions at the western front and
overrunning their highly- fortified trenches".
</P>
<P>
In its press release, the Office of Government Spokesperson
said that "after successfully achieving their mission", the
Ethiopian troops that had been controlling western Eritrea since

as part of their larger military strategy to liberate all
Ethiopian territories under Eritrean occupation," the office said.
</P>
<P>
During the military operation, the office said, many Eritrean
troops were killed, wounded or captured while large caches of
Eritrean weapons, ammunition and other military supplies were
captured or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian troops' withdrawal from the Eritrean territory
occurred hours before the proximity talks between the two
belligerent countries begins on Tuesday.
</P>

Unity, is designed to help put an end to the two-year-old

<HEADLINE> Chinese Doctor Publicizes Antidote of Pesticide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese doctor publicized the
formula of an antidote that he developed to save human lives from
a prohibited pesticide on the Internet today.
</P>
<P>
The antidote against the highly toxic tetramine can be found on
two websites: www.hospl.ac.cn and www.chinainfo.gov.cn.
</P>
<P>
Ying Binyu, a doctor from the No.2 Hospital attached to the
Wenzhou Medical School in Zhejiang province in east China, said
that he hopes his discovery will be used to save as many lives as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Tetramine was invented by Bayer AG of Germany in 1949, but due
to its side effects the company stopped producing the pesticide
long ago. China has also long prohibited its production and use
because of high risks to human beings.
</P>
<P>
However, some underground workshops in China still produce such
pesticide. Over the past few years, more than 1,000 people have
been killed by the pesticide each year.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Several mortar shells exploded
midnight Monday near the headquarters of Iran's Basij militia in
eastern Tehran, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the explosions took place in a sport
complex near the Basij Highway, causing no casualty.
</P>
<P>
The Basij is a force created after the 1979 Islamic revolution
in an effort to set up a 20-million-strong army of volunteers. It
is now part of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC).
</P>
<P>
Security and intelligence personnel have found a 60mm mortar
launcher not far away, the report said, adding that no one has
claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Iran's militant opposition, the outlawed
Mujaheddin Khalq Organization (MKO), fired at least three mortar
shells on a sport complex near the headquarters of the
Revolutionary Guards and the security forces in northern Tehran.
</P>
<P>
In February and March, the group launched two mortar attacks on
central Tehran, one was close to the government building including
the Majlis (parliament) and presidential office, another close to
the Revolutionary Guards headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The MKO was a famous political-military group which fought
against the former shah's regime in the 1970s. It was outlawed in
1981 and forced to flee to Iraq after their dispute with the
clerics brought to power by the Islamic revolution intensified.
</P>
<P>
Called by Tehran as a "terrorist group," the MKO has staged a
series of cross-border attacks inside Iran in recent years. Iran
responded with air raids on MKO bases inside Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Europe-Asia Business Summit Opens in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The two-day Europe-Asia
Business Summit opened here Tuesday with a call on European and
Asian entrepreneurs to forge partnerships and cooperation
beneficial to all involved.
</P>
<P>
Making the call at the opening ceremony, Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad said European and Asian entrepreneurs
alike must actively broaden their scope and to take the next step
in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The summit, themed "Reshaping European-Southeast Asian Business
Ties: New Conditions, Shapes, Trends and Opportunities," is
intended to discuss business opportunities in Asia, development in
transportation and infrastructure, regional ports and airports,
business opportunities in Thailand after the economic crisis,
business opportunities in Europe, the multimedia super corridor in
Malaysia and the tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Invited speakers include cabinet ministers, corporate leaders
and business figures from Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said "There are obviously opportunities and challenges
galore in a re-shaped European-Southeast Asian business ties. Both
sides must accept the need to reshape and to seize the
opportunities as well as to face the challenges. Facing the
challenges together could make them less difficult and more likely
to succeed."
</P>
<P>
He urged Europeans to be prepared to work with Southeast Asians
so as to ensure that benefits are fairly shared and that a win-win
result becomes possible.
</P>
<P>
Information technology, multimedia and the Internet has opened
up many new opportunities for Europeans to do business in
Southeast Asia and to a lesser degree for Southeast Asians to do
business in Europe, Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
"One of the ways is for European companies advanced in
technology to become strategic partners of the Southeast Asian,"
he said, asking European partners to be prepared to transfer
technology at nominal cost to their joint venture partners in
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister told Europeans, "So prosper your Southeast
Asian partners and they will prosper you. Beggar them and you will
be that much poorer."

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Asked to Promote Pencak Silat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian traditional martial
art and sport pencak silat has been recognized internationally but
it has never received any special attention from the government,
said director-general of informal school education, youth and
sports at the national education ministry Endro Sumarjo.
</P>
<P>
It is important that the government work together with the
Indonesian Pencak Silat Association (IPSI) to increase the sport's
popularity both nationally and internationally, he was quoted by
the Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sumarjo urged IPSI officials to submit a proposal to include
the sport in the junior and senior high school curriculums, adding
that it had already been incorporated in the elementary school
curriculum along with nine other sports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Olympic Committee of Asia will send
representatives to observe pencak silat at the 15th National Games
in Surabaya, capital of East Java, next month before deciding
whether it should be exhibited at the 2002 Asian Games in Pusan,
South Korea.

<P>
WASHINGTIN, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Getting 25 points from Larry
Johnson 25 points and showing the excellent games, the New York
Knicks defeated the Indiana Pacers 91-89 to even the Eastern
Conference finals of the National Basketball Association at two
games apiece.
</P>
<P>
New York played again without center Patrick Ewing, but the
other injured Knicks suited up and played.
</P>
<P>
Latrell Sprewell, who broke a bone in his left foot at the end
of Game 3, collected 12 points and helped hold Jalen Rose to 18.
Marcus Camby had eight rebounds, five points and three blocks.
</P>
<P>
But nobody on New York had a bigger game than Johnson. Johnson
shot 10-for-16 from the field, making five 3-pointers, with seven
rebounds and four assists.
</P>
<P>
The series will return to Madison Square Garden for Game 6
Friday night and Game 5 is Wednesday night at Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
Allan Houston totalled 17 points for the Knicks, Kurt Thomas
collected 16 and Charlie Ward had 16 points, seven assists and six
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
Reggie Miller had 24 points for the Pacers, who could never
come all the way back after allowing the Knicks to score 32 points
in the first quarter and open a 14-point lead.
</P>
<P>
Indiana pulled within three on a 3-pointer by Travis Best with
10.5 seconds left, but Sprewell iced the victory by making the
second of two foul shots with 4.1 seconds to go. Sprewell actually
missed his second attempt, but Rose was called for a blatant lane
violation to give Sprewell another chance.

HANOI, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese grand master Dao Thien Hai
has made full use of his home advantage to win the Far Eastern
qualifiers for this year's five-million-dollar world chess
championship, organizers said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Philippine international master Buenaventura Villamayor took
the second qualification spot for the championships to be held in
India and Iran in November and December, the Singporean president
of the organizing committee, Ignatius Leong, said.
</P>
<P>
Dao Thien Hai was only the fourth seed going into the nine-day
tournament held in the southern coastal resort of Vung Tau, but
the seven points he won from his nine matches were enough to
secure him victory in front of home fans at the first qualifiers
to be held in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The top seed, Indonesian grand master Utut Adianto, could only
manage fourth place while the second and third seeds, Filipinos
Eugene Torre and Rogelio Antonio, managed only ninth and sixth
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese grand female master Hoang Thanh Trang, who had
entered the competition in a bid to achieve her ambition of a male
grand master title, only managed 13th place. She was the sole
woman in the competition.
</P>
<P>
A total of 32 players took part in the nine-day tournament.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Acting State Secretary Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He said he had met the president to hand in his resignation on
Monday night, and the president has accepted the resignation.
</P>
<P>
"The president said he could understand," Bondan was quoted by
the Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bondan, who also holds the post of Secretary of Government
Supervision, became the latest high profile casualty in the 35
billion rupiah (4.1 million U.S. dollars) State Logistics Agency (
Bulog) scandal.
</P>
<P>
He said he was just being used as an intermediate target before
the president.
</P>
<P>
"I resign ... because I believe that the attacks against me are
merely an intermediate target towards Gus Dur (President
Abdurrahman Wahid). I don't want to be a burden to him," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Bondan was quick to underline that his resignation was not
an admission of guilt.
</P>
<P>
"I know nothing about Bulogate (Bulog scandal)," he added.
</P>
<P>
The scandal revolves around 35 billion rupiah from the Bulog
employees-owned foundation Yanatera involving no less than the
president's masseur Suwondo, who is also a businessman. In the
latest revelation, lawyers for Bulog deputy chief Sapuan, one of
the main suspects in the scandal, said he agreed to disburse the
funds because he believed he was acting under presidential orders.
</P>
<P>
Bulog chief Rizal Ramli suspended Sapuan, who is now in police
custody, in connection with the case. Suwondo, now at large
overseas, has been named one of the most wanted suspects by police.
</P>
<P>
Bondan allegedly received part of the money. Earlier on Monday,
he said that he already had professed his innocence and said he
was ready to explain the affair at any time.
</P>
<P>
Bondan was only brought into the Cabinet in January. He becomes
the sixth man to leave Wahid's Cabinet.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Coup Leader Rejects Military Takeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speight also refused to release Prime Minister Mahendra
Chaudhry and up to 30 hostages being held at Parliament House but
said they were safe and well, according to the AAP.
</P>
<P>
Speight told a news conference he rejected Bainimarama's
seizure of power and said the Fijian military forces were divided
into two rival factions.
</P>
<P>
"I think Commodore Bainimarama is a lost cause. I think he is
so blinded by his allegiances to Ratu Mara that it clouds his
ability to take the right decisions -- socially, culturally and
morally," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Speight said he was instead dealing with a group of four
military officers headed by Colonel Tara Kinikini who he said
wanted a speedy political solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speight accused Bainimarama and Sitiveni Rabuka, former prime
minister and a major mediator to the political crisis, of working
together to retain power.
</P>
<P>
"It is an orchestrated plan to ensure (my) crusade does not
proceed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speight said an amnesty for him and his men was the least of
his concerns.
</P>
<P>
"We want an abrogation of the 1990 constitution and we want to
put in place a Taukei (indigenous) civilian government to rule by
decree," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Speight said four of his senior supporters had been detained
overnight by the army at a military checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
Speight's reaction appeared to lessen the chances of an early
release of the hostages who've been held at gunpoint by Speight's
supporters since May 19, the AAP said.
</P>
<P>
Bainimarama took executive power in Fiji Monday night declaring
military government and martial law following the resignation of
President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, according to the AAP.
</P>
<P>
The Age newspaper quoted Bainimarama as saying Monday night
said Mara had resigned earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Mara's private secretary Joe Brown was also quoted as saying
that senior military officers had approached the president,
presented him with a traditional whale's tooth, and asked him to
step aside to allow them to solve the nation's crisis.
</P>
<P>
Brown said that Mara had been moved out of his official
residence a few hours before Bainimarama announced he had assumed
executive authority, the Age reported.
</P>
<P>
"He is in a safe place," Brown was quoted as saying, adding the
military had told him that Mara "gladly gave up the reins."
</P>
<P>
Despite the imposition of martial law, there were no soldiers
surrounding the parliamentary compound where the hostages are
being held, the AAP said.
</P>
<P>
It was also reported that a truckload of Speight supporters
Tuesday dressed in blue boiler suits arrived and joined hundreds
of others already in the complex.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Violence Kills 44 in North Maluku, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Ethnic bloodshed continued in
Indonesia's North Maluku province when at least 44 were killed and
hundreds of others injured in a predawn attack on two villages on
Halmahera Island, reports reaching here Tuesday said.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Pattimura Military Command overseeing Maluku, Brig.
Gen. Max Tamaela, confirmed the incident which took place in
predominantly Christian villages Makete and Duma, in Galela
District.
</P>
<P>
"I've received a report that 44 died and I've ordered troops
from Jailolo district and Marine personnel from Morotai to secure
the villages," Tamaela was quoted by the reports as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the attack took place at 05:00 a.m. (local time)
on Monday by an armed mob from the Halmahera sea.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deputy Chief of the Galela-based Synode Masehi Injil
Halmahera Church, Rev. Biso, put the death toll in Monday's
predawn attack at 50 and the number of injured at 102.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, community leaders in Galela and Tobelo districts
have rejected the presence of security troops in the area as they
felt that some of them were taking sides with one of the warring
camps.
</P>
<P>
Maluku island has witnessed more than 18 months of ethnic
bloodshed involving Christians and Moslems, which killed thousands
of local residents and injured thousands of others.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, at least 32 people were reportedly killed and 52
injured when the clashes took place in Galela and Tobelo
subdistricts in North Maluku.
</P>
<P>
With the latest clashes, the death toll have reached at least

STOCKHOLM, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The first-ever Global Ministerial
Environmental Forum, sponsored by the United Nations Environment
Program (UNEP), opened in the southern Swedish city of Malmo on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In face of increasingly serious environmental deterioration,
the world should not only tackle the problems as they are, but

a bid to enhance the comprehensive management of environment, said
UNEP Director Klaus Topfer at the opening ceremony.

The enormous disparity between the rich and the poor and the

important roots which are hard to eliminate, he added.

In response, Swedish Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson said it
needs deeds not just words to solve the environmental problems
because they cannot disappear automatically.
</P>
<P>
At the three-day forum, world environmental ministers will
narrow their differences over some crucial issues through
consultations and informal discussions with people from the
academic, industrial and commercial, social and media circles to
prepare for the United Nations Millennium Assembly in September
and a gathering in Rio, 2002.
</P>
<P>
Three topics will be discussed during the forum: the major
environmental challenges in the new millennium, private sector and
environment, responsibilities and functions of the society to the
environment in a time of globalization.
</P>
<P>
A manifesto will be released at the end of the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Looks to Overhaul Badminton Player Recruitment System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- After Indonesian men's shuttlers
brought home the Thomas Cup this month, the Badminton Association
of Indonesia (PBSI) has started grooming younger players to defend
the sport's most prestigious team event in two years time.
</P>
<P>
PBSI official in charge of athletes development Mangombar
Ferdinand Siregar said that the Thomas and Uber Cups in Kuala
Lumpur this month gave a valuable lesson to the organization to
reconsider its promotion, relegation and recruitment system.
</P>
<P>
"Other countries, especially China, anticipated our strength by
recruiting young talented shuttlers. If we don't want to be shut
out of the spotlight on the podium, we must work faster and harder
in recruiting young players," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post
Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 10 members of Indonesia's Thomas Cup team are an average of
25 years or older except for Taufik Hidayat, who will be 19 on
August 10. Most of China's team are younger than 25.
</P>
<P>
In 2002, Indonesia is expected to be without senior shuttlers
Rexy Mainaky, Ricky Subagja, Hariyanto Arbi and Antonius Budi
Ariantho, who all plan to retire after the Olympic Games in Sydney
in September.
</P>
<P>
Siregar said PBSI plans to recruit 16-year-old girls and 17-
year-old boys in singles to be groomed soon to replace their
elders.
</P>
<P>
"We can't jut depend on the results of national junior
tournaments. PBSI officials in charge of talent scouting must open
their eyes to be able to recruit the right potential players. We
have signed an agreement with the government of Germany to help us
decide the parameters in selecting the right players. The
parameters will include the criteria of potential shuttlers on the
basis of their posture, mental and technical skills," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I have also talked to National Sports Council psychologists to
discuss the possibility of testing the juniors' psychological
condition before we decided to admit them. It's really important
to see how they will be able to manage all barriers during their
career," he added.
</P>
<P>
PBSI will only have 52 shuttlers in its National Badminton
Center in East Jakarta, compared to 65 at present.
</P>
<P>
PBSI has staged an internal promotion-and-relegation selection
to weed out shuttlers with little potential, who would be returned
to their clubs, and to admit younger ones in the center.
</P>
<P>
Siregar admitted PBSI's problems in realizing its nation-wide
branches' vision on the recruitment system because they all wanted
the association to recruit winners from the national tournaments.
However, some of the players were considered too old to benefit
from being placed in the center.

LISBON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Two cargo ships collided Monday off
the Portuguese coast with six crew members missing, Portugal's
maritime rescue agency confirmed.
</P>
<P>
A South Korean container ship and a Norwegian freighter
collided at 1:30 p.m. near the coast of Lisbon. The Norwegian
freighter Nord Frakt sank immediately and its six crew members
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean vessel, the Hunday Emperor, suffered minor
damage and took part in search operations for the missing, along
with two Portuguese navy planes and nearby vessels.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the maritime rescue agency said the cause of the
collision was under investigation, but suggested that one or both
of the ships failed to respect the sea lane boundaries. They did
not expect the missing to survive because of cold water.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Announces Economic Adjustment Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, May 29 (Xinhua)-- Argentina's Government
announced Monday a package of adjustment measures in a bid to save
938 million US dollars from public expenses and bring down its
fiscal deficit.
</P>
<P>
The package announced by Economy Minister Jose Luis Machinea
consists of measures designed to reduce public expenses, bring
down fiscal deficit, increase budgets for public tasks, create
more jobs as well as better the social security system.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, salaries of public employees will be cut by
12 percent for those earning between 1,000 and 6,500 dollars a
month, and 15 percent for those earning over 6500 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Jose Luis Machinea rejected a devaluation or a dollarization of
Argentina's economy as alternatives to spur its economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Argentina, Latin America's third-largest economy, has struggled
to recover from a two-year recession first brought on by the 1997
Asian financial crisis, and later compounded by Brazil's
devaluation of its currency last January.
</P>
<P>
Not long after assuming office last December, President De la
Rua pushed through a highly unpopular tax hike to raise added
funds to help Argentina prune its federal deficit.
</P>
<P>
Satisfied with what the Argentina's government has done, the
International Monetary Fund approved a 7.4 billion dollar standby
loan for the country in February this year.

Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and neighboring Lingyuan County
in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Experts have confirmed that the fossils mainly belong to about
seven categories, including a large number of tailed amphibians,
which demonstrate the abundance of biological groups in the region.
</P>
<P>
Experts also believe that these findings will provide important
clues for comparing fossils of the same period found in
neighboring countries including Mongolia and Russia.

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Trial Views Blasted Cargo Container </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Scottish judges on
Tuesday viewed in court as evidence a blasted cargo container
aboard the Pan Am airliner that was blown off the sky in December
1988.
</P>
<P>
Pieces of the container with Pan Am insignia were brought into
the courtroom after two days of adjournment.
</P>
<P>
British accident investigator Peter Claydon told the court that
a high-energy blast occurred within the container.
</P>
<P>
Claydon's testimony supported the prosecution's allegation that
an explosive device hidden in a suitcase carried in a cargo
container brought down Pan Am Flight 103, killing 259 people on
board and 11 others on the ground on December 21, 1988.
</P>
<P>
Libyans Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and Al-Amin Khalifa Fahima were
accused of conspiracy of murder, murder and breaching the
international aircraft safety act.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors accused the two Libyans of hiding an improvised
bomb in an unaccompanied brown suitcase which originated in Malta,
where they had both worked as Libyan Arab Airlines staff.
</P>
<P>
Last week another British investigator testified that there was
an error in the calculation for the investigation that led to the
report on the disaster since the formula used to calculate blast
impact waves had been incorrectly applied.
</P>
<P>
Correct calculations would have indicated that the bomb went
off around 30 centimeters from the fuselage skin of the aircraft
instead of 63 centimeters as stated in the report.
</P>
<P>
The defense team has been training in on any clue that may cast
doubt on exactly where the explosion went off so as to divert the
focus on who actually had planted the bomb on the New York-bound
plane.
</P>
<P>
Under Scots Law, the prosecution bears the burden of proof and
has to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt for the judges to
deliver their verdict.
</P>
<P>
If found guilty, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa
Fhimah would be sentenced to life imprisonment and serve their
jail term in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
If found not guilty or the court could not prove the case
against them, the two accused Libyans would be set free.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited trial is expected to last up to a year and the
court holds sessions almost daily except for a summer recess
between July 28 and August 22.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Encouraged by Ethiopia's Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States was "
encouraged" by reports that Ethiopia had started partial
withdrawal from the western part of Eritrea, the State Department
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia announced the partial withdrawal earlier Tuesday,
saying it had withdrawn its army from western Eritrea after
accomplishing its military objectives there, but it also stressed
that fighting would continue until Eritrea had withdrawn from all
"occupied" territory in other regions.
</P>
<P>
The State Department statement called on the Ethiopian
government to "desist from all further offensive actions,
including air attacks of the kind carried out against a power
plant near Massawa and against the Asmara airport."
</P>
<P>
"Among other reasons, we are concerned by any interruption of
the flow of relief and humanitarian supplies to the civilian
victims of this conflict. The airport is an important
transshipment point for such supplies," State Department spokesman
Philip Reeker said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Eritrea said it had pulled its troops back some 20
km from positions held since 1998, in line with Ethiopia's demands
and an appeal by the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
Reeker said the United States had "confirmed that Eritrea had
done so."

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Meet on Horn of Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council is
expected to begin a meeting on the current conflict between
Ethiopia and Eritrea here on Tuesday afternoon, a U.N. spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Fred Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, told a press conference that
the meeting is scheduled to begin at 5:00 p.m. EST, at which the
15 Council members are to be briefed by the U.N. undersecretary-
general for political affairs, Kieran Prendergast, on the conflict
in the Horn of Africa region.
</P>
<P>
The Council meeting is to take place after Ethiopia said
Tuesday that it had asked the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
to modify its plan to end the war with Eritrea, taking into its
sweeping battlefield gains.
</P>
<P>
After a day of closed-door talks in the Algerian capital,
Algiers, Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin said some
provisions of the internationally-backed OAU plan had become
redundant.
</P>
<P>
"We will see how the OAU plan can be adapted to the reality on
the ground," Seyoum said. "There are some provisions which have
been made irrelevant."
</P>
<P>
On Monday, thousands of new Eritrean refugees poured across
the Sudanese border to Lafa, arriving on foot, donkey carts and
trucks and tractors, which shuttled them away from villages in
western Eritrea that had reportedly been taken by Ethiopian troops,
Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday morning, the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) reported from Lafa that the numbers crossing
dwindled overnight but small groups were still arriving. They
estimate that the total for the previous 24-hour period could
reach 10,000.
</P>
<P>
"Most of those crossing into Sudan on Monday were children and
women, although there were also significant numbers of men,"
Eckhard quoted the UNHCR report as saying. "The latest arrivals
are exhausted and badly in need of water and food."
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program (WFP) said Tuesday that its airlift to
Eritrea is continuing despite the bombing of Asmara airport and
its surrounding vicinity. WFP Tuesday continued airlifts of high-
energy biscuits to Asmara to feed thousands of recently displaced
people from the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The fighting has displaced up to half a million people in
Eritrea, which like Ethiopia is threatened by famine after a
prolonged drought. In all some nine million people need food aid
in both countries.

LIMA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Peru's government said Tuesday it
has prepared an international defense strategy to face
accusations that last Sunday's runoff election in the country was
illegitimate and fraudulent.

ambassador Beatriz Ramacciotti will face report of OAS' observing

HAVANA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A group of farmers from Arkansas,
the United States, directed by two Democrat congressmen are
visiting Havana to explore Cuba's market, the daily "Granma"
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to this publication, the visit of this American
delegation "goes against the blockage's designations, kept for
over 40 years, and comes within the growing tendency of the
Capitol and other strata of this country to promote a policy
change" toward Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is made up by producers of rice, wheat, soybean,
poultry merchandise, headed by Senator Blanche Lincoln, as well as
President of the Federation of Arkansas' Farmers David Hillman.
</P>
<P>
According to "Granma," Lincoln "not only is partisan of sales
of foodstuffs and medicines to Cuba, but also is among those who
back up a new initiative in the U.S. Congress supporting plainly
and clearly an end to the blockade."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation met Monday evening with President of Cuba's
parliament Ricardo Alarcon, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade Orlando

<HEADLINE> Greece Launches Campaign Against Smoking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Greece's Health and Welfare
Ministry Tuesday initiated a campaign to inform citizens on the
dangers of smoking, in light of the international day against
smoking Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The campaign's slogan is "smoking kills-do not let them
deceive you," urging Greeks to stop smoking, as Greece ranked
first in tobacco consumption in the 15-member European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Currently, Greece's percentage of men smokers amounts to 60
percent while for women the figure is 26-30 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1952, the first health regulation forbidding smoking in
public transportation vehicles was put into effect in Greece, a
new regulation forbade smoking in enclosed public spaces in 1980,
and in 1993, a ministerial decision forbade smoking in buildings
of the health service sector.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Greece adopted the first law forbidding the
advertisement of tobacco products on television and radio.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, tobacco companies were obliged by new regulations to
place the well-known health warning on every package of smoking
products "Smoking causes serious damage to the health."

He said the government's commitment to addressing the problem

<HEADLINE> Italy's Alitalia in Search For New Partner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Italy's flag carrier Alitalia won't be
getting back together with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and is
currently shopping around in Europe for a new partner, the
chairman of the airline's public holding company IRI said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a speech before the Lower House Transport Committee, IRI
chief Piero Gnudi said that "the split with KLM must be considered
definitive," despite the fact that the alliance "was and remains
valid from an industrial and strategic point of view."
</P>
<P>
He said that Alitalia was now forced to seek a new
international alliance, because only then could it "confront the
market from a position of strength and with adequate economies of
scale."
</P>
<P>
He said that the search for a fresh partner would be a "complex,
systematic process" and that the airline was "currently looking
around in Europe."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the airline had experienced "great
difficulties"in 1999 and the first quarter of 2000, due to the "
sector's negative trend" and the failure to get the new Milan
airport of Malpensa 2000 fully off the ground.
</P>
<P>
Gnudi said that Alitalia was suffering from the fact that
European airlines were continuing to use Milan's smaller but more
conveniently situated airport of Linate, while Alitalia had
transferred all its international flights to Malpensa, which lies
54 kilometers outside of the city.
</P>
<P>
He said that other factors such as the Balkans crisis and high
fuel costs had also caused a big dent in company profits.
</P>
<P>
Returning to the subject of KLM, Gnudi insisted that he didn't
really understand why the Dutch carrier decided to withdraw from
the strategic alliance with Alitalia.

KLM announced on April 28 that it was dumping Alitalia, citing
uncertainties surrounding the future of Malpensa and the stalled
privatization of Alitalia, which was originally slated for sell-
off by June 30.
</P>
<P>
The development of Malpensa into a fully operational
international hub was a crucial feature of the alliance announced
by KLM and Alitalia in December 1997 and which became operative in
November 1999,with KLM retaining the option of terminating the
accord if the airport failed to take off.
</P>
<P>
Malpensa has been dogged by problems ever since its official
launch in the Autumn of 1998, with environmental concerns,
stemming from unacceptable noise pollution levels, playing a major
part in its failure to become fully operational.
</P>
<P>
KLM Chairman Leo Van Wijk said earlier this month that Alitalia
's poor profit forecasts had also caused some turbulence.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Provinces Urge for Immediate Health Care Injection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Provincial health ministers of
Canada urged for an immediate federal injection of 4.5 billion
Canadian dollars (about 3 billion U.S. dollars) at a meeting
opened Tuesday in Quebec City.
</P>
<P>
According to Quebec Health Minister Pauline Marois, the
injection could restore transfer payments from the federal
government to provincial health care and social programs to a
level of five years ago.
</P>
<P>
"After that, we'll discuss what could interest the provinces
in other areas concerning health," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian federal government has promised long-term funding
on condition that the provinces agree to map out plan of reforms
with federal Health Minister Allan Rock.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time the provincial health ministers have met
to discuss an agreement on health. They met with Rock months ago,
but failed to reach any deal because of the same differences,
where Rock insisted on a reform plan first, while his provincial
counterparts put more federal cash at the top place.
</P>
<P>
In a 62-page "cost-drivers" document presented to the meeting,
the provincial ministers said, "Canada's publicly funded health
care system is not in crisis, but the cost pressures and
constraints on the system are real."
</P>
<P>
Provincial and territorial health expenditures will be 67
billion Canadian dollars (about 44.7 billion U.S. dollars) within
five years and almost 85 billion (about 56.7 billion U.S. dollars)
within 10 years, as a combined result of population growth, aging,
inflation and rising costs for current programs, they said.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Rebound Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stock rebounded
sharply Tuesday as investors rushed in to seek for the bargains in
the battered market after a three day Memorial weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 227.89 or 2.2
percent at 10,527.13. The blue chip index was down 327.61 points
last week.
</P>
<P>
The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 254.37 or 7.9
percent at 3,459.48. The composite was 37 percent off its peak of
5,048.62 points reached on March 10.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor'
s 500 index rose 44.43 at 1,422.45.
</P>
<P>
Technology and telecommunications shares led the rally today as
investors sought for the bargains in the battered market that
suffered from higher interest rates in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications shares rose amid the news that France
Telecom is buying Britain's Orange from Vodafone Air Touch for
about 37.6 billion U.S. dollars in cash and stock. The deal raise
speculation that more global mergers will follow in the telecom
industry.
</P>
<P>
Technology shares also rose as Sun Microsystems, Intel and
Cisco Systems gained ground.
</P>
<P>
Investors did not care about higher interest rates as the
Conference Board reported that the U.S. consumer confidence index
rose sharply in May, approaching the all-time high reached in
January despite the volatile financial markets and interest rate
hikes. The sharp rise in the index would have prompted a big
selloff on a weaker day.
</P>
<P>
But Merrill Lynch, the global securities and economics group,
said in its latest survey that the U.S. economy is moderating so
that the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle is nearing an end. The
survey expects the rate to top out at 6.75%, at most, 7%.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 12.49 at 641.38 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 16.44 at 897.85. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 19.33 at 476.70.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 2,035 up, 934 down and 457
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 816.59 million shares from 719.92
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Study Sea-Based Missile Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The study, required by Congress and now more than a month
overdue, comes as President Bill Clinton prepares to decide --
probably by November -- whether to go ahead with a defense against
ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration believes the only way to develop a
national missile defense by the target date of 2005 is to exclude
sea-based elements, which require more technical work, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
"Our feeling is that a sea-based system requires more
development and would take more time and possibly cost more money
than a land-based system," Bacon said. "But we are examining that.
"
</P>
<P>
Bacon did not comment directly on a recent Washington Post
report that the Pentagon has concluded that sea-based national
missile defenses could be built with existing technology and would
improve the proposed land-based system.
</P>
<P>
The international community has opposed the NMD, which would
either breach or require major changes to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty between the United States and the then Soviet Union,
a cornerstone of arms control.
</P>
<P>
Arms control experts said the U.S. plan to set up the NMD
system runs against the trend of the times and will have a major
adverse impact on global and regional strategic balances and
stability.

<HEADLINE> OECD Forecasts Growth of 2.9 Percent in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Italian economic growth will be close
to 3 percent this year but welfare and administrative reforms are
urgently needed and a tight rein must be kept on spending, the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A half-yearly survey by the Paris-based think-tank forecast
growth edging up next year to 3.1 percent, from about 2.9 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
The favorable economic situation is due to an acceleration in
international demand while domestic demand is still lagging, the
OECD said.
</P>
<P>
A completion of pension reform and achieving higher levels of
efficiency in public administration are "essential".
</P>
<P>
But moves are also needed in the labor market to increase
competition and remove hurdles to entry in certain non-financial
service sectors, the report said.
</P>
<P>
This will lead to more jobs being created and the narrowing of
the gap between various areas of the country, it added.
</P>
<P>
But there are uncertainties posing threats. Inflation is
forecast at 2.5 percent this year but if it should take off again,
then Italy will be unable to fully exploit the benefits of the
weak euro, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Another worry is the public debt. According to the OECD, the
deficit should be kept under a tight watch to avoid it spinning
out of control if current-account spending and spending by local
administrations becomes too lax.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Strongly Backs OAU in Seeking Peaceful End to Horn of Africa Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Tuesday voiced its welcome to the resumption of the proximity
talks between Ethiopia and Eritrea and expressed its strong
support to the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in its effort
to find a peaceful solution to the conflict in the Horn of Africa
region.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press, the president of the
Security Council, Wang Yingfan of China, said, "Members of the
Council welcomed the resumption" of the peace talks held in
Algiers, capital of Algeria, Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council expressed their strong support to the
efforts of the OAU in finding a peaceful solution of the conflict,
" the statement said. "Members of the Security Council called on
the parties to cease hostilities and concentrate on diplomatic
efforts to resolve their conflict."
</P>
<P>
The statement came after U.N. Security Council began a closed-
door meeting, at 5:00 p.m. EST, at which the 15 Council members
were briefed by the U.N. undersecretary-general for political
affairs, Kieran Prendergast, on the conflict in the Horn of Africa
region.
</P>
<P>
The Council meeting took place after Ethiopia said Tuesday
that it had asked the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to
modify its plan to end the war with Eritrea, taking into its
sweeping battlefield gains.
</P>
<P>
After a day of closed-door talks in the Algerian capital,
Algiers, Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin said some
provisions of the internationally-backed OAU plan had become
redundant.
</P>
<P>
"We will see how the OAU plan can be adapted to the reality on
the ground," Seyoum said. "There are some provisions which have
been made irrelevant."
</P>
<P>
On Monday, thousands of new Eritrean refugees poured across
the Sudanese border to Lafa, arriving on foot, donkey carts and
trucks and tractors, which shuttled them away from villages in
western Eritrea that had reportedly been taken by Ethiopian troops,
Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday morning, the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) reported from Lafa that the numbers crossing
dwindled overnight but small groups were still arriving. They
estimate that the total for the previous 24-hour period could
reach 10,000.
</P>
<P>
"Most of those crossing into Sudan on Monday were children and
women, although there were also significant numbers of men,"
Eckhard quoted the UNHCR report as saying. "The latest arrivals
are exhausted and badly in need of water and food."
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program (WFP) said Tuesday that its airlift to
Eritrea is continuing despite the bombing of Asmara airport and
its surrounding vicinity. WFP Tuesday continued airlifts of high-
energy biscuits to Asmara to feed thousands of recently displaced
people from the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The fighting has displaced up to half a million people in
Eritrea, which like Ethiopia is threatened by famine after a
prolonged drought. In all some nine million people need food aid
in both countries.
